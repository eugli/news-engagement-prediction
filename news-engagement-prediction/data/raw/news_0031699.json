There are many key players involved in making this a reality. — 123rf.com \nCloser to home, more than 74.7% of Malaysians – as stated by the CIA Factbook – \nCities consume a lot of energy, generate staggering amounts of greenhouse gases and account for the majority consumption of the world’ \n“In just 33 years, our cities need to be able to cope with the influx of citizens. In the past decade alone, the rate of residential waste and residential electricity consumptions had increased by 90% and 204% respectively. According to the World Bank Economic Monitor 2015 – Transforming Urban Transport report, congestion costs in Kuala Lumpur alone was RM5.5bil in ­productivity loss, not including the fuel wastage and the environmental impact,” A smart city needs smart and involved citizens. Most developed cities have citizen participation in every aspect. — \nWith the growing demand for efficiency and resources, smart urban environment is necessary. How we build, sustain and ­manage cities is key to a smooth oper \nTechnical Code states that a smart sustainable city is “an innovative city that uses information and communications technology and other means to improve quality of life” Knowledge Group of Companies general manager Vincent Fong says how we build, sustain and manage cities is key to smooth operation of urban areas, — \n“ \n“Our view is that a smart city is one that tackles modern urban challenges while future-proofing itself. The core components of a smart city are based on Technology, Urban Design, Public Policy and Citizens with the end goals of sustainability, livability and efficiency,” \n“Society has always tried to use technology to solve problems – \n“But now, South Korea is doing very well. Their Songdo IBD smart city is one of the good representatives of greenfield smart ­cities. It started happening in the 90s, but the South Koreans had the idea even before that,” \nDe Castro says that initially, smart cities only focused on environmental and ­sustainability issues but now, more \n“Examples of Brownfield cities in Malaysia are Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Malacca. These cities need to contend with the inherited issues of previous ­administrations and policies. It is a typically more challenging retrofit while performing the daily functions of your typical city ­services,” \nGreenfield cities on the other hand have the inherent advantage of not having to contend with legacy infrastructure but has the challenge of attracting the general population to migrate to these new cities. One such example is Iskandar Malaysia in Johor. Smart Plants refer to pockets of activities within a city with some smart elements such as Cyberjaya Smart Traffic Lights, Smart Selangor’ \n“From our observations, several states are taking the lead in terms of implementing some smart initiatives, namely Malacca, Selangor and Johor,” \n“You must solve one problem at a time and keep it as simple as possible, focusing on making lives better. You can focus on ­several spot projects but not lose the big ­picture,” \nAnd benchmarking against another smart city doesn’ \n“One of the top projects that is working well around the world is mobility – managing the flow of people and goods. Secondly is public safety. We are going to see many ­projects on these two main areas. \n“Why spend millions on creating an app to communicate with the citizens when you can utilise WhatsApp for free? When it comes to education or health, use what you already have and make it smarter. You ­probably already have the records of the students or patient digitally. What is missing now is the open data to connect all these information. Once you have all these ­connected, you have a mountain of ­information and analytics that can change the whole reality of education or health in your country. And that’s just one example there,” \n“By the time you have achieved the goals you have set for your city, or even before that, the needs for the city would have evolved so drastically that the very ­definition of a smart city would have been redefined,” \nFong believes that city leaders need to constantly have a finger on the pulse of a city’cordingly despite the challenges. \nOne of the biggest challenges of developing a smart city is unsurprisingly funding. \n“City leaders often lack the funding to finance these projects; they often find ­themselves in a position where they ­recognise the importance of these smart ­initiatives but are unable to take any actions as their budget is mostly utilised for the ­operating expenses of vital day to day city services, explains Fong. \nAnother problem is bureaucracy. With ­several layers of government and needed co-ordination between various agencies, many city leaders are often caught in a web of bureaucracy instead of creating an ­impactful change. \nThis isnt a problem in our neighbouring country however, says Fong. \n“Singapore is a city-state. They announced their ambition to become a Smart Nation in 2014 and we’” \nFong adds that some initiatives that are good in the long run are not necessarily ­popular with the voter base. For example congestion taxes and increased parking rates that are popular measures in European ­countries to reduce traffic. \n“ \nBut ­sometimes, the unpopular choice is necessary to move forward. \nIt takes a nation \nRome wasn’t built in a day, and neither would a smart city. There are many key ­players involved, as identified by Fong. First are the Federal and State level governments, which need to co-ordinate efforts and ­strategies on a higher level. Then municipal councils need to be attuned to their ­respective cities and identify suitable ­solutions based on its citys unique needs. \n“We need civil societies and industry ­associations as pressure groups to implement policies and sounding board for standards. Private sectors need to provide relevant solution and consultancy services, adds Fong. \nThe group also includes academia and research to provide scientific data and innovations to commercialise as well as venture capitalists to provide funding to startups to introduce innovation to the market. \nBut most importantly, a smart city needs smart and involved citizens. Most developed cities has its citizens participating in every aspects of running the cities. This in turn increases citizen satisfaction. \nBy getting the citizens to participate, it reduces the conflict of opinions which makes implementation easier. Smart citizens should be fully inclusive and innovative. \n“Do the re-engineering top down, that is the best way to build and focus on the DNA of your smart city,” says De Castro. “People don’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:37:52.344+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
