(Representative image) \nFour persons, including Samajwadi Party candidate Siddhgopal Sahu’s son were injured after party workers and supporters of the ruling party in the state and BSP clashed during phase 4 polling for Uttar Pradesh Elections 2017, according to ANI report. Polling for the fourth phase of seven-phased Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017 has started today. Parties are contesting today for 53 assembly constituencies spread over 12 districts including the poverty-hit Bundelkhand region and Congress party’s home turf Rae Bareli. \nFor the first time since 1998, Congress president Sonia Gandhi couldn’t campaign for her party in the district which she also represents in the Parliament. Some other districts going to the polls in the fourth phase include Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Allahabad, Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Mahoba, Banda, Hamirpur, Chitrakoot and Fatehpur. There are as many as 680 candidates in the fray and their fate would be decided by 1.84 crore voters. The maximum number of 26 candidates are in Allahabad North, while only six candidates are in the fray in Khaga (Fatehpur), Manjhanpur (Kaushambi) and Kunda (Pratapgarh). \nYou may also like to watch \nThe fourth phase of elections in crucial for the BJP as it doesn’t have any MLA in any of the 53 constituencies going to the polls today. In 2012, the ruling SP had won 24 seats out of 53, BSP 15, Congress 6 and others 3. A number of heavyweight candidates are contesting in this phase. They include sitting MLA Aradhana Mishra from Rampur Khas (Pratapgarh), the daughter of Congress MP Pramod Tiwari, and Independent MLA and minister Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya. Though no party appears to be winning a clear majority until now, polls today may provide some clarity, especially after visible attempts to communalise and polarise the voters during the campaign that ended on Tuesday.
