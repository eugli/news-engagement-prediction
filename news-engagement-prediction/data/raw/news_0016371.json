Is this considered handphone driving?\" \nAccording to the Traffic Police, handphone driving occurs when these 3 conditions are in place: (a) the vehicle is in motion; and (b) the driver is holding on to the handphone with one hand; and (c) the driver is communicating with any person with that handphone. \nThat means, the officer was not handphone driving.
