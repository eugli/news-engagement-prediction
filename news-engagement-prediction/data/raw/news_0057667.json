For example, Colorado’s Denver Public Schools last week passed a resolution saying the school board’s general counsel “will not grant access to our students unless the official presents a valid search warrant issued by a federal or state judge or magistrate,” according to CNN .\nDPS Superintendent Tom Boasberg wrote in a memo on the school system’s website that DPS officials will “do everything in our lawful power to protect our students’ confidential information and ensure that our students’ learning environments are not disrupted by immigration enforcement activity.”\nAnd school officials in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, passed a resolution last month requiring that all ICE requests “must be processed through the Law Department and the Office of the Superintendent.”\n“Schools will not permit ICE officials to access any students, without having contacted the Law Department with all relevant documentation,” public schools spokeswoman Ebony Pugh said.\nAccording to 2014 data from the Pew Research Center, 725,000 students enrolled in K-12 in the U.S. — or 1.3 percent — were illegal immigrants. Approximately 3.9 million students are the children of illegal immigrants.", "external_links": ["https://www.dpsk12.org/our-dps-weekly-protecting-our-students-rights/", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/presidential-executive-order-enhancing-public-safety-interior-united", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/22/us/chicago-public-schools-immigrant-students/index.html?sr=fbCNN022317chicago-public-schools-immigrant-students", "http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/17/children-of-unauthorized-immigrants-represent-rising-share-of-k-12-students/"], "published": "2017-02-23T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:13:45.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
