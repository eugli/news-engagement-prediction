There is a strong interest among the Cambodian people (for the film),” he added.\nIt is the second movie Jolie has made tackling the subject of genocide -- in 2011 she made a film about the Bosnian conflict featuring entirely local actors.\nBut her latest silver screen offering is more personal.\nJolie adopted her first son Maddox from an orphanage in Cambodia’s western Battambang province in 2002 and frequently travels to the country. She was awarded Cambodian citizenship by King Norodom Sihamoni.\n  \nFamily ties \n  \nIn an on-set interview with the Guardian published last month, she said it was Maddox, 15, who urged her to make the film.\n“He was the one who just called it and said he was ready and that he wanted to work on it, which he did. He read the script, helped with notes, and was in the production meetings,” she said.\nBecause of those who survived and remember the brutal regime, Jolie has been at pains to ensure she treads carefully as a foreigner tackling such a sensitive topic.\n“Here everyone has been through it. Everybody is standing ten feet away from someone else who has been through it,” she told the Guardian.\nAs a result, she pushed to ensure the film would be both made by Cambodians and accessible to them.\nAlmost the entire film is in the Khmer language while all the cast members and much of the crew were local hires.\nThe film is also co-produced by Rithy Panh, Cambodia’s most acclaimed filmmaker.\nHe lost almost all his immediate family during the Khmer Rouge years but went on to produce some searing documentaries about the genocide that helped break the silence surrounding what happened.\nThe premier at Angkor will be followed by screenings across the country, some seven months before the film is released to a global audience on Netflix.\nSaturday’s premier will be a rare public appearance for Jolie since her high-profile split last year from Brad Pitt.\nTogether they had brought up Hollywood’s most celebrated family with three of their six children adopted from overseas.\nJolie is expected to hold a press conference on Saturday afternoon alongside author Loung Ung. -AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:40:41.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
