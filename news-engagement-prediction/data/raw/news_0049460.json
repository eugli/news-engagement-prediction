A year earlier, CPS attendance was more than 94 percent.\nAttendance of Hispanic students was down significantly, with nearly a quarter of all Hispanic students not coming to school, according to CPS. More than 100 schools saw their attendance rates fall below 80 percent of what they were a year earlier.\nThousands of people rallied in Union Park before marching downtown in support of immigrants’ right Thursday.\nAnticipating that the protest could affect attendance, CPS Chief Education Officer Janice Jackson sent a note to parents on Wednesday.\n“Every CPS school will welcome all children, regardless of their race, ethnicity or country of origin, and create a safe and affirming environment where those students can learn. We believe that every child has the absolute right to a quality education, which is why we want to see all students in school every day, including this Thursday,” the note read.\nIn an emailed statement, CPS said it will not allow agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to enter schools or access student information except when a warrant or court order is presented.\nRecords show that most of the undocumented people arrested in raids by immigration officials in five cities earlier this month were not the violent criminals Trump has vowed to target for deportation.\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials based in Chicago arrested 239 people in the raids. But more than a quarter — 72 — did not have a criminal background, according to a letter from ICE officials to Democratic members of the U.S. House who requested the data.\nPreviously from Politics Hispanic CPS schools' budgets cut twice the rate of white ones Donald Trump Presidents Day: More Sweden fallout Trump taps military strategist as national security adviser – Chicago Sun-Times Emanuel’s share-the-wealth fund generates $4 million so far – Chicago Sun-Times # a day without immigrants", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/englewoodsquareunderconstruction.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/ap17044049861442.jpg?w=100", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/schoolcuts1claypool.jpg?w=100", "http://wp.me/p7fJAs-25qO", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/trumpmcmaster1.jpg?w=100"], "published": "2017-02-21T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:32:07.850+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
