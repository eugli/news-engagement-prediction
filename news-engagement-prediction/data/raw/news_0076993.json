The number of markers confiscated was more than the total inventory at a nearby Whataburger restaurant. (credit: Northeast Police Department) \nOn the department’s Facebook page they said you know there’s a pretty serious problem “when we (NEPD), at times possess more of these numbers than the restaurant does.” \nThe orange, numbered plastic table order markers disappear so quickly at one Whataburger location that the restaurant orders new bundles weekly . \nPolice say taking the markers isn’t a game, it’s theft and could result in a citation being issued for Theft of Property.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:39:39.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
