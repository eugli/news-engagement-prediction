Because a year hasn’t past since the Warriors traded Bogut, the NBA rules seemingly dictated that the Australian wouldn’t be allowed to sign with his former team. \nHowever, after a review of the NBA’s Collective Bargaining Agreement, a case can be made that Bogut would technically be allowed to sign with the Warriors; if both sides possessed that desire. \nThe relevant paragraph appears in the Salary Cap and Related Rules section of the CBA, under the Additional Trade Rules subheading: \n“If a team trades a player and the player is subsequently waived by the new team, the prior team will not be permitted to claim the player off of waivers or sign the player to a new contract until the earlier of (i) one year from the date the trade was completed, or (ii) the July 1 following the last season of the player’s contract (excluding any unexercised option years).” Andrew Bogut.

The CBA doesn’t mention any rule that states that one can’t sign with any team before that, even if it’s in the one-year period. \nIt’s not known whether the NBA interprets that rule as ‘all prior teams’ within the one-year period. \nIf we apply a very literalist reading to the CBA, Bogut should be allowed to sign with the Warriors; the team that traded him in order to free up space to sign Kevin Durant. \nBogut spent four years with the Warriors, winning a championship in 2015, while helping the team to an NBA record 73 regular season wins in 2016. \nWhether there’s mutual interest between the two parties, today, remains an unknown. \nOlgun Uluc covers basketball for Fox Sports Australia.
