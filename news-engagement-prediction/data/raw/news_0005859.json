His last movie, Thoppil Joppan was engulfed by the tremendous success of Pulimurugan, but the movie was money-earner still for the financiers. And now the multiple time National award winner is ready with his new movie, The Great Father. \nThe makers have released a motion poster of the movie, that is really making us curious about the movie. The video starts off with a bungalow being recreated from a design, in which the camera goes inside to show us the character played by Tamil actress Sneha and Anikha (the child actress who was quite impressive in 5 Sundarikal, Bhaskar The Rascal and Yennai Arindhaal). The background score swells at this point and is quite impressive to hear, as the video reaches its final moments where we get the view of Mammootty in a cap with a bearded look. Overall, there is a dark, foreboding but intriguing tone to the whole video. \nWatch it hereâ€¦ \nFrom what we heard, Mammootty plays the role of a builder with Sneha playing his wife and Anikha his daughter, and the movie will focus on the relationship between the father and daughter. The Great Father is directed by Haneef Adeni and produced by Prithviraj Arya, Santosh Sivan and Shaji Nadesan under their banner August Cinema. Arya will also play the antagonist in the movie.
