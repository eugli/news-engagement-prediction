Today’s leaked renders do show off a design for the device that appears to be slightly different than the Gold model of the phone though. The fingerprint sensor in particular seems to have changed a bit as it’s round in the leaked image for the Gold colored phone , while in today’s leaked image the fingerprint sensor carries a square shape. \nThere is also a difference with the LED flash module that sits to the right of the dual camera sensors on the back of the device, as the flash in the leak for the gold phone is round, while it takes on more of a rounded rectangular shape in today’s leak. These small but noticeable changes suggest that the previous leak may have been incorrect, or it could just mean that it was an older render of an unfinalized design, while these renders of the phone in black are potentially meant to be the finished product that will be launched for consumers. \nIn addition to those minor details for design changes, the Black color looks to be pointing to at least two colors for the device, and it’s possible that Huawei could launch more than just two colors for the phone as well. Huawei is expected to showcase the P10 and P10 Plus at Mobile World Congress later this month and while nothing has been confirmed in regards to specifications, there have been leaks about the phone’s hardware too. A recent leak from just a couple of days ago suggests that the Huawei P10 Plus comes with 8GB of RAM, although if true this may be a variant of the device as 8GB is more than most smartphone users would want or need in a mobile device. The P10 Plus is also said to come with a 5.5-inch Quad HD screen and come running on Android 7.0 Nougat software. While the phone is expected to be announced at the end of this month, a launch may not happen until March or April.
