As the conflict raged more than 50 years later, Lincoln insisted that work on the U.S. Capitol Dome continue. He viewed the construction project as a clear signal that “we intend the Union shall go on.” Lincoln was the first president to get Congress to levy an income tax. In 1863, Lincoln also got the lawmakers to proclaim Thanksgiving as the nation’s sole federally authorized holiday with religious roots.\nFourteen years before his 1860 presidential campaign, Lincoln was elected to the House from Illinois as a Whig anti-war activist. He spoke out against the Mexican-American War, which he saw as evidence of President James Polk’s desire for “military glory — that attractive rainbow that rises in showers of blood.”\nHe voted with the Whigs to push through an anti-war resolution on an 82-81 procedural tally. The vote sent a resolution back to a committee with instructions that the panel add the words “a war unnecessarily and unconstitutionally begun by the president of the United States.” While the amendment passed, the underlying bill never reemerged.\nHe hurt his standing when he told the House that “God of Heaven has forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women and children, and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.”\nTwo weeks later, Polk sent a peace treaty to Congress ending the war. When Illinois Democrats branded Lincoln as a demagogue and a slanderer of the president, he decided, given his unpopularity, to spurn politics and henceforth earn his living as a lawyer.\nLincoln’s reputation was grounded in a speech he delivered to the Young Men Lyceum of Springfield, Illinois, in 1838. The then-future president denounced mob violence and called on citizens to faithfully follow the law.\n“At what point shall we expect the approach of danger?” he asked. “By what means shall we fortify against it? Shall we expect some trans-Atlantic military giant, to step the ocean, and crush us at a blow? Never!\n“All the armies of Europe, Asia and Africa combined, with all the treasure of the earth (our own excepted) in their military chest; with a Bonaparte for a commander, could not by force, take a drink from the Ohio, or make a track on the Blue Ridge, in a trial of a thousand years.\n“At what point then is the approach of danger to be expected? I answer, if it ever reaches us, it must spring up amongst us. It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher. As a nation of freemen, we must live through all time, or die by suicide.”\nSOURCE: WWW.HISTORY.COM", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:46:39.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
