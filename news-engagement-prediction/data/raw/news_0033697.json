We remain committed to safeguarding the value of the Naira by ensuring that our Naira banknotes are not susceptible to counterfeiting. \n‘’We also work constantly with relevant security agencies to monitor and check the activities of counterfeiters. \n‘’Members of the public are therefore advised to disregard the false alarm raised by the said former CBN official, be wary of the activities of counterfeiters and report any case of counterfeiting to the police and their banks.’’ \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:35:54.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
