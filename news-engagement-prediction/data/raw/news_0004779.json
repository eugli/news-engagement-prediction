She has an old soul \nEmily Estefan at her debut at Festival Miami. Versatile Light \nRemarkably, Estefan folds her myriad influences into her musical vocabulary and still sounds like no one other than Emily Estefan. \nOne of the concert’s highlights was Estefan’s smoldering take on the 1937 standard, “Where or When.” Estefan prefaced the familiar jazz tune by telling the audience of her connection to the music of the ’20s, ’30s and ’40s. “I listen to those arrangements where I hear the tight voicings on clarinets and I feel nostalgic.” 3. Girl power \nEmily Estefan performs with her 9-piece band at UM Gusman Concert Hall. Howard Cohen. \nA fun tribute to women female artists, with Estefan pounding a set of drums center stage, featured the music of Janet Jackson, Alanis Morissette, Celia Cruz, Chaka Khan and even her mother’s first English language single, “Dr. Beat,” which had a proud Gloria Estefan, whom she called “Conga Queen,” dancing out of her seat. \nA warm reading of Billie Holiday’s “Lady Sings the Blues” scored, too, seeming to emerge from a musician of far greater vintage as opposed to the young, chatty 22-year-old before us. Continued below 4. She's nervous, but that's normal \nIf anything revealed Estefan’s age and novice experience, it was the nervous chatter that dominated a bit too much. Understandable, an engaging Estefan still bantered with one too many “just kidding” quips and awkward stage patter between songs. This flaw, which is is common to newcomers who feel they must fill every moment on big stages, is perhaps the only trait the preternaturally gifted Estefan shares with other beginners. \nEstefan, a willing student, will no doubt learn. No less a talent than the great Tony Bennett went through the same struggles in the first years of his career he wrote in his 2012 book, “Life Is a Gift: The Zen of Bennett.” (Harper; $28.99.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:04:48.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
