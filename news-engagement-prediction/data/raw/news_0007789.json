Gov. Dan Patrick is criticizing a business group study suggesting that the so-called “bathroom bill” could cost Texas billions in lost revenue. \nThe Texas Association of Business has estimated that a proposal barring transgender Texans from using the public restroom of their choice could cost the state up to $8.5 billion. \nThe study also referenced North Carolina, which faced boycotts and lost major sporting events after approving a similar measure. \nPatrick has decried the study before. But he called a news conference Monday to brand it “bogus” and “fear mongering.” \nHe also pointed to a newspaper fact-check story questioning the study’s methodology. \nIn a statement Monday, the association again pointed to North Carolina’s fallout saying “we don’t need studies alone to prove the negative impact of this unnecessary legislation.” \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
