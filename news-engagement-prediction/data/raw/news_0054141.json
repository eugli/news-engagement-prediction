These two-year, $60,000 fellowships are awarded yearly to 126 researchers in the United States and Canada in recognition of distinguished performance and a unique potential to make substantial contributions to their field. Since 1955, Sloan Research Fellows have gone on to win 43 Nobel Prizes, 16 Fields Medals, 69 US National Medals of Science, and numerous other distinguished awards. Congratulations Mark! \nProfessor Schmidt's influential research focuses on developing faster algorithms for large-scale machine learning, with an emphasis on methods with provable convergence rates and that can be applied to structured prediction problems. These have many applications, including computer vision, medical image analysis, and natural language understanding. He holds a Canada Research Chair in Large-Scale Machine Learning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:34:09.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
