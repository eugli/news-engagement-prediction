It went beyond being a directive on where to urinate; it was a clear message from the most powerful institution in America that if you mess with the basic rights of transgender youth, you will face a backlash.\nFast forward to 2017, and we are faced with Trump recalling this guidance . It’s a clear and open capitulation to those who might be alienated by the slightest glimmer of a socially progressive version of Trump. It is also a deliberate act of transphobia, cloaked in the right-libertarian rhetoric of allowing states to make choices that affect them, playing on conservative fears of federal intervention.\nThroughout his campaign, we were assured by Trump that he saw fit for the transgender community to “use the bathroom they feel is appropriate”, and yet, this was never a position shared by his support base.\nIn any conversation around transgender rights and the battle over bathrooms, there was a pervasive trans-misogynist figure: a lurking man in a dress, ready to swoop upon poor innocent cisgender girls and subject them to unmentionable acts. Never, of course, acknowledging the fact that it is trans youth who are in danger of violence when using bathrooms.\nThe controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 10 show all The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump and abortion Protesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March\nGetty\n2/10 Trump and abortion US President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House\nGetty Images\n3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' Nancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.

A man who professed he wanted money for Aids treatment to be spent instead on conversion therapies: the same conversion therapies Leelah Alcorn was forced to endure, before eventually killing herself.\nWe may never know the full machinations of Trump’s White House, but it’s not hard to see that the Vice President has asserted some influence on the administration’s LGBT policy.\nBy placing Trump as the saviour of conservative America’s children from sexual violence, Pence seeks to create a return to conservative American values, no matter what the human cost. And it is exactly that, the human cost, which worries me. A Trump presidency will not last forever, nor will its laws. This act alone does not scare me, what scares me is how many more Leelahs and Blakes there will be.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:02:55.505+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
