Somebody's trying to start trouble,\" Conway told Fox News host Sean Hannity during a pre-taped interview at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md.\n\"About 5 percent of what I'm asked to do in this White House counselor role is TV. I think that's about right because he's the president now and he's his own best messenger.\"\nConway pointed to Trump's recent rally in Orlando and a 77-minute press conference last Thursday, which was received by some media outlets as more contentious than previous presidents' briefings.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\n  Washington Examiner News Alerts.   alert soon!

For example, over the past few days Conway has been absent from the TV circuit after saying last week that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had the \"full confidence\" of Trump despite the adviser's being terminated later that week.\n\"I don't think I have to explain myself if I'm not going to go on TV if I'm out with four kids looking at - for three days - looking at houses and schools. A lot of my colleagues aren't trying to figure out how to be a mother of four kids, I assure you,\" Conway added.\nShe also said her steady TV presence may have blocked other personalities from getting their time with the media, prompting them to go after her.\n\"There are some people, I think, trying to get in my way. I've also gobbled up a lot of people's TV opportunities,\" Conway said.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner White House, VA split on anti-Trump tweets The issue has come up as more tweets have emerged in which senior-level VA officials have mocked Trump.\nBy Pete Kasperowicz â€¢ 02/23/17 12:01 AM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:09:29.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
