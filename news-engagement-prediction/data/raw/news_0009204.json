The star posted a picture last night with a fierce Rapunzel-style braid, with slicked-down baby hairs and major hoop earrings. Sound familiar? It seems like Jenny from the Block is back—for one photo at least—and I am here for it. Now there’s no doubt, that Lopez can pull off any hairstyle , including a wavy lob and major topknot , but there is something extra-special about her vibe that caught my attention. Her entire beauty look paid homage to the Puerto Rican girl who grew up in the Bronx, proving that no matter where life takes you, you never forget where she came from. In the photo, you can see a profile view of her hairstyle, which includes a high-braid with her baby hairs laid to perfection. Hairstylist Chris Appleton, who created her braid, also posted an image where you can see a full view it in all its glory. For her makeup, Lopez went with a bright orange-red lip and the classic bronzed J.Lo glow, created by makeup artist Mary Phillips. And of course her look wouldn't be complete without the must-have Boricua accessory: hoop earrings.
