The principle of free access to people in need must be implemented now and without repeated requests.\"\nZa'atari added that the situation was complicated by the \"tit-for-tat arrangement\" between the towns, whereby no aid can be provided to Madaya and Zabadani without similar access to Fua and Kafraya, and vice versa.\nThe linkage \"makes humanitarian access prone to painstaking negotiations that are not based on humanitarian principles,\" he said.\n\"This has prevented medical cases from receiving proper treatment and evacuation. People are in need, and they cannot wait any longer. We need to act now.\"\nFua and Kafraya, the last two government-held villages in Idlib province, are surrounded by a rebel alliance including Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly al-Qaeda's Syrian branch) .\nThe UN's last humanitarian access to the four towns was in November, the statement said, without directing blame for the lack of access at one side or the other.\n'One million under siege' Earlier this month, the UN said it had been able to deliver aid to just 40,000 people in besieged and hard-to-reach areas in January, despite requesting access to more than 900,000 people.\nThat made January the worst month for humanitarian deliveries in nearly a year, with approval received for just one of 21 humanitarian convoys proposed by the UN, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent.\nAccording to Siege Watch, a monitoring group that tracks besieged communties, more than one million Syrians live under siege in Damascus governorate, Idlib governorate, Homs and Deir Ezzor.\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:38:57.284+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
