A post shared by Ray (@rayophotography13) on Feb 12, 2017 at 10:07pm PST \nI t happens every February when the sun’s rays hit the waterfall at exactly the right angle to create the optical illusion. \nSharing his latest photos on Instagram, Mr Lee explained his images of the rare phenomenon first went viral last year. A post shared by Ray (@rayophotography13) on Feb 14, 2017 at 10:50am PST \n“It's that time of year again for the famous firefall,” he explained. “This trip almost didn't happen due to the crazy road conditions at Yosemite. There has been so much water that a lot of the roads were closed due to mudslides. Somehow we made it here at the very last minute. \n“I still think the mist I saw last year was better but it wasn't bad this time either. Had an awesome time with some fun and talented photographers. \n“For those that plan on going to see this, be careful since there has been so much water that some of the roads are falling apart. Had an awesome weekend!!! - A special thank you to my wife for letting me go on these crazy fun trips before I get too old to travel.” \nT he US Department of the Interior reshared the photo adding: “This rare phenomenon only happens for a short time in February (if the conditions are perfect). \n“When the setting sun’s rays hit the waterfall at just the right angle, it illuminates the water in brilliant reds and oranges. It’s a spectacular sight reminiscent of Yosemite’s historic Firefall!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T18:03:13.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
