T+L Newsletters \nFrom the \"Best Job in the World\" to the \"Best Life in the World,\" this couple have turned adventure travel into a lifestyle. \nBack in 2009 , British charity fundraiser Ben Southall bested over 35,000 other applicants to win the so-called “Best Job in the World”: acting as caretaker of Hamilton Island in Australia's idyllic Whitsundays on the Great Barrier Reef . \nThere, Southall was responsible for promoting the area as a tourist destination for six months, ditching his old life to seize the adventure of discovering what the Whitsundays had to offer and documenting it publicly for potential visitors. (He was also given a substantial stipend, residence in a villa, and access to all of the region's tourist activities and transportation.) Simon J.

He even met his wife, a fellow blogger and adventurer named Sophee, at a tourism event. Together, they decided to turn their travel savvy into a joint career path. \nThey launched \"Best Life in the World,\" a website that tracks their journeys and helps them pay the bills.

Now, Sophee is currently longboarding 1,000 miles around Tasmania to raise money for a mental health non-profit.
