Fly me to the moon … Ok https://t.co/6QT8m5SHwn \n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 27, 2017 \nIt will be the first time in 45 years that humans will go to “deep space,” the company said in a release. \n“Next year is going to be a big year for carrying people to the space station and hopefully beyond,” Elon Musk told reporters, CNN reports. Story continues below \nThe two people who will see the stars approached the company, and they’ve already paid a “significant” deposit. Musk, however, would not disclose the cost of the week long trip. \nThere are no details on who the tourists are, thought Musk clarified that it’s “nobody from Hollywood.” \n“Like the Apollo astronauts before them, these individuals will travel into space carrying the hopes and dreams of all humankind, driven by the universal human spirit of exploration,” the release read. \nMusk says SpaceX is on track to launch astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA in mid-2018. This moon mission would follow about six months later, using a Dragon crew capsule and a Falcon heavy rocket. \nFile Photo: SpaceX CEO Elon Musk (R) unveils the Dragon V2 spacecraft in Hawthorne, California May 29, 2014.
