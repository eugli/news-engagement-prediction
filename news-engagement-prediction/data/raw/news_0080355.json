Charles Breen says Williams pursued the car to a Saint John parking lot, where he turned his SUV around and speedily drove straight into one of the passengers, sending him flying and spinning through the air.\nThe video shows the man being thrown to the ground as the car races away and saying that he couldn't move his arm, though Breen says he suffered non-life-threatening injuries.\nWilliams pleaded guilty Friday to three charges, including assault with weapon, dangerous driving and leaving the scene of an accident.\nWilliams, who lives in Saint John, is to be held in custody until his April 10 sentencing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:40:57.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
