The court has asked the Indian government to make it compulsory for prepaid phone users to prove/disclose their identity before they can recharge their phone numbers with credit. \nChief Justice of India JS Khehar made the announcement earlier this week as a plea was brought to court. The court has given the government a time-frame of one year to implement this new rule. \nThe court added that a customer would be required to fill an Adhaar-based form before recharging in order to verify the identity. However, the court did not elaborate whether existing customers will have to do the same to recharge their phones. © India \nAadhar card is used as an identity for various documentation and verification purposes, thanks to the biometric nature of the program. Citizens of India had to register their fingerprints and iris scans in addition to other identity details to get an Aadhar card. Currently, there are over 1 billion Aadhar cardholders in the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:22:10.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
