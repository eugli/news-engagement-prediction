YES!” \nThere are calls like the Cal-Stanford “The band is on the field!” and “Down goes Frazier!” or “The Giants win the pennant!” \nBut Michaels’ call takes us out of the action and instantly puts it into historical context. This isn’t just an upset, or a win on the ice. It’s arguably the all-time greatest David and Goliath moment on the world stage with the Cold War as its backdrop. And on top of that, the “YES” captures what everyone said when the clock hit zero. \nHappy Miracle on Ice Day, everyone. \n— USA Hockey (@usahockey) February 22, 2017 More!
