England were as good as dead and buried but somehow survived.\nBut England under Eddie Jones have found a way of staying alive. They believe they are going to win even when defeat is staring them in the face. Jones has imbued them with a never-say-die attitude and they simply refuse to lie down. They are a very good team indeed.\nElliot Daly beat Alex Cuthbert for pace as he crossed in the corner for the winning score with just five minutes remaining\nDaly is joined by Owen Farrell after he finished off a slick attacking move on the counter after a poor clearing kick from Wales\nEngland kept alive hopes of back-to-back Grand Slams with their hard-fought victory at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff\nWith barely four minutes left on the clock and trailing 16-14, fly half George Ford gathered Jonathan Davies’ hopelessly ill-directed clearance kick and whipped the ball across the line to Owen Farrell who fed Elliot Daly on the left wing.\nAs the crowd held their breath, Daly answered those who believe he is not a winger by leaving Alex Cuthbert —playing in place of the injured George North — trailing in his wake and scorching over in the left-hand corner for the match-winning try.\nFarrell’s conversion rubbed salt in Welsh wounds and ensured England’s remarkable winning run stretched to 16, 15 of them coming since Jones took over in December 2015.\nThey now have two weeks to catch their breath before facing Italy at Twickenham and England will know they still have plenty of room for improvement.\nWales' hopes of a Grand Slam evaporated in front of their vociferous home support as they failed to cling on for the win\nBen Youngs crossed for his side's first try of the game in the opening period after sustained pressure from Eddie Jones's men\nMATCH FACTS: Wales:\nLeigh Halfpenny; Alex Cuthbert, Jonathan Davies, Scott Williams, Liam Williams; Dan Biggar, Rhys Webb; Ross Moriarty, Justin Tipuric, Sam Warburton; Alun Wyn Jones (capt), Jake Ball; Tomas Francis, Ken Owens, Rob Evans\nReplacements: Scott Baldwin, Nicky Smith, Samson Lee, Cory Hill, Taulupe Faletau, Gareth Davies, Sam Davies, Jamie Roberts\nTries: Williams (1)\nConversions: Halfpenny (1)\nPenalties: Halfpenny (3)\nEngland:\nMike Brown; Jack Nowell, Jonathan Joseph, Owen Farrell, Elliot Daly; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Nathan Hughes, Jack Clifford, Maro Itoje; Courtney Lawes, Joe Launchbury; Dan Cole, Dylan Hartley (capt), Joe Marler\nReplacements: Jamie George, Matt Mullan, Kyle Sinckler, Tom Wood, James Haskell, Danny Care, Ben Te'o, Jonny May\nTries: Youngs, Daly\nConversions: Farrell (1)\nPenalties: Farrell (3)\nBut for now, they can savour one of the great Test matches of recent times.\n‘We have used up all of our get-out-of-jail cards and against Italy we don’t want to be in that position again,’ Jones said.\n‘I thought it was a great game of Test rugby; a great contest skill around the park. A lot of credit goes to Wales who were superb. They hit hard and hit often off the ball which made it a fantastic Test match.’\nFor the young Wasp Daly, usually a centre but also capable of playing wing or full back, his match-winning try completed a remarkable turn-around in fortunes.\nSent off on only his second start against Argentina last autumn, his wonderful and timely finish here proved his versatility to play across England’s back line and vindicated Jones’ decision to select him out of position.\nAnthony Watson look set to be fit to face Italy at Twickenham a week next Sunday but Daly looks certain to retain his place.\n‘He’s got gas, the boy, and he’s got a bit of x-factor about him and that’s why we like him,’ Jones said.\n‘I don’t necessarily think wing is his best position but it suits us at the moment and you’ve got to be running over 10 metres per second to score that try today and he did that.’\nFor all the plaudits they will rightly receive for their sheer bloody-minded will to win, England will also be concerned at being physically outmuscled for a second week running.\nHad Wales coach Rob Howley not taken off his team’s bone-crunching No8 Ross Moriarty on 52 minutes, just seconds after he had knocked Maro Itoje and Owen Farrell into the middle of next week, the outcome could have been different.\nWith Moriarty off the field, replaced by a barely fit Taulupe Faletau, England’s forwards — led by towering performances from locks Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes — found a foothold in the game.\nBetween them, England’s locks made 35 tackles and claimed nine lineouts while Launchbury carried 18 times, making him the visitors’ second most effective carrier behind No8 Nathan Hughes.\nDan Cole carries hard at Tomas Francis and advances England over the gainline after coming up against the Welsh prop\nMaro Itoje produced a relentless display both with ball in hand and also in defence in what proved to be a war of attrition\n‘At stages I thought we were going to fade out of the game but we hung in there making tackles and Courtney Lawes is like a human ice pack,’ Jones added.\n‘He has ice all over him after that many tackles and carries. Joe Launchbury as well. We have good characters in our team and young players which is even more attractive for us going forward.’\nWales lost North, who sustained a hamstring injury against Italy, on the morning of the game and felt on the back foot after Jones insisted on playing with the stadium roof open, but Howley’s men were hugely competitive in this game and would have won, had it not been for Davies’ late missed touch.\nLiam Williams crossed to bring the stadium to its feet after a slick attacking move through the middle of the Red Rose defence\nWilliams' try helped his side to a half-time lead, with Leigh Halfpenny adding two penalties as they went in 13-8 up\nCourtney Lawes carries the ball into opposition territory under pressure from his opposite number Jake Ball\nThe Principality Stadium played host to a ferocious encounter between Wales and England as the roof stayed open\nMike Brown carried typically hard, but was stopped on this occasion under the attention of Scott Williams and Dan Biggar\nYoungs helps England clear their lines with a box kick from within his own half under pressure from Rhys Webb\nFly half Dan Biggar enjoyed a magnificent 80 minutes while scrum half Rhys Webb was an irritant in every sense, only spoiling a wonderful display with some brattish goading of England’s players after mistakes had been made.\nMoriarty was a colossus, while the move which led to Liam Williams 38th-minute try, after Ben Youngs had put England ahead with a well-worked try on 19 minutes, was of the highest calibre.\nAt times Wales’ back play was crisp, their forward play direct and their defence brutal.\nBut England, clearly missing the ball-carrying bite of the Vunipola brothers, stood toe to toe and despite being repeatedly pummelled against the ropes, simply refused to succumb to a knock-out blow.\nIn the end, for the 15th game in succession under Jones, it was England who delivered the killer punch as his replacements rode to the rescue, just as Ben Te’o’s 71st minute try saved them against France. Te’o, it must be said, was excellent again here.\n‘England are a very good rugby team,’ said Wales coach Howley. ‘They have found a way to get over the line and that gives them a lot of confidence. They believe they’re going to win in the last 10 minutes and that is pretty precious.’\nJack Clifford, making his first start in the No 7 shirt, said: ‘We are becoming a tough side to beat. That showed with those passes from George Ford and Owen Farrell who put Elliot into space — he relied on his pace and stole it in the end.\n‘It was great for him to get over the line. I have known Elliot for a long time and he has always been a speedster — his slide tackle to kick the ball into touch in defence was really good too.\n‘It was tough — you look at the calibre of players Wales had — but it was great to get the start.’ England produced a wonderful backs-to-the-wall style victory against their old rivals, as Danny Care enjoys the celebrations", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T20:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T03:35:26.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
