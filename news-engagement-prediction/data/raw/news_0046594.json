Chuck Schilken British media. “I said, ‘I don’t know. I’ve eaten nothing all day, so I might give it a go later on.’”\nThat part may not sit well with the FA and Britain’s Gambling Commission, both of which are investigating the incident. \nShaw said he picked up a meat and potato pie at halftime but waited until Sutton had used up all its substitutions, ensuring he would not be called upon to play, before indulging. British TV showed the player known as the “roly-poly goalie” eating the pie on the sideline during its broadcast of the game. \nGambling house Sun Bets tweeted that it “paid out a five-figure sum” on Shaw’s late-game meal. \n“Integrity in sport is not a joke, and we have opened an investigation to establish exactly what happened,” Richard Watson, the Gambling Commission's enforcement and intelligence director, said Tuesday. “As part of that we'll be looking into any irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its license requirement to conduct its business with integrity.” \nShaw said the stunt was for “a few of the mates and a few of the fans.” \nHe added: “We're not allowed to bet, but a few of the lads laid on. So hopefully there will be a pie and a pint in the local [pub] when I get back.” \nFA rules state “a participant shall not bet, either directly or indirectly, or instruct, permit, cause or enable any person to bet on the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in, a football match or competition.” \nAn FA spokesperson said , \"We are investigating to establish whether there has been any breach of the FA rules relating to betting.\" \nNo matter what comes out of the investigations, the incident has enhanced the reputation of the already popular player — much to the chagrin of those above him in the organization. \n“Wayne has become a global superstar on the back of being [322 pounds],” Sutton Manager Paul Doswell said. “He’s made that a chance to get more media coverage off the back of it. It wouldn’t surprise me. I don’t think it shows us in the best light.” \nSutton Chairman Bruce Elliott said of Shaw: “He has got himself in the papers again and the fame obviously has gone to his head a little bit, but we will soon bring him back down to earth, don’t worry about that.” Caption Dodgers FanFest: Take me out to the ball game \nSights and sounds from Saturday's Dodgers FanFest at Dodger Stadium. \nSights and sounds from Saturday's Dodgers FanFest at Dodger Stadium.
