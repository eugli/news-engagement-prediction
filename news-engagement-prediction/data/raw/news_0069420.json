Credit: AP \nDonald Trump's government is reportedly drafting legislation that will scrap nationwide rules protecting transgender students' rights to use toilets that match their gender identity. \nAny such move would overturn landmark guidance put out under Barack Obama ordering schools to allow students to use the toilets of their choice - or potentially face the loss of state funding. \nA new document cancelling Obama's order could be released imminently, according to campaign groups who have been in touch with the president's administration over the issue. \n\"We are hearing that it will be rescinded today,\" said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. Campaigners had speculated that Trump would loosen rules protecting trans students. Credit: AP \nQuestions around transgender people's toilets have become a touchstone issue within US political debate in recent months. \nLGBT campaigners have said that it is only right for transgender people to be allowed to use the toilets of their adopted gender, with students facing the prospect of being forced to drop out if they cannot relieve themselves. \nThat is bitterly opposed by some sections of the right wing. Some have said women could be put at risk of attacks by men as a result - though there is no documented evidence of any such incident. \nTrump had changed his position on transgender rights during the course of his presidential campaign. \nHe initially said that trans people should use whichever toilet they feel most comfortable with, but later said states should be allowed to make their own rules on the subject after he came under criticism from some quarters of the Republican party.
