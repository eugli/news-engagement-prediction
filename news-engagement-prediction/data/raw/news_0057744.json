For the first time ever, Pawan Kalyan will be seen in a rural avatar as he plays a village lad in Katamarayudu. And so, anticipation surrounding his look has been pretty high. In an effort to look his part, the actor has apparently put in a lot of thought and will be seen in eco-friendly clothes throughout the film.\n“Kalyan sir was really keen on donning handlooms throughout the film, and we’ve managed to achieve an overall eco-friendly look for his character.,” shares Ishita Singh, the actor’s designer and stylist for the film. She adds, “The aim was to make him look relatable to the common man, and not to go over the top.Whether the pancha and kanduva he wears, or the kurtas, they will strike a chord.”\nInterestingly, the actor has started endorsing handlooms too. “It was a coincidence that he started the endorsement midway through the film because even before that, he preferred them. In fact, we’ve been doing a similar kind of\nattire for his political meetings too. We used cotton and linen majorly for almost all the clothes he’s wearing in the film, and have sourced fabrics from across the country,” explains Ishita, adding that even the rudraksha mala Pawan wears, the traditional chappals and the buttons on his shirts, were all specially custom-made for him.\nThe actor’s looks have generated a lot of interest but is he a tough taskmaster? “He’s really easy and accommodating. If not for him and Sharrath Marar, the output we’ve managed to create wouldn’t be possible. We are elated that people are excited about his look,” says Ishita.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:34:01.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
