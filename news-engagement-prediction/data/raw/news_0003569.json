I don't know if it's because he's from Jordan or not, but it seems to me that we have heightened our scrutiny of this so more people will get caught up in minute errors, not crossing their T's or dotting their I's.\" \nMohammad is among dozens of visa holders and immigrants to be detained at U.S. airports since Trump Friday signed an executive order indefinitely barring all Syrian refugees from entering the United States and suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days. It also prohibits citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States for 90 days, whether they are refugees or not. Those countries include Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \nAli Zakaria , an attorney representing Mohammad's family, said after volunteering at airports this weekend and talking with colleagues in other areas, it appears that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials are tagging travelers from other Muslim-majority countries for secondary security screenings. \nIt is possible Mohammad revealed he was enrolled at Katy High School during the secondary, heightened security check. \n\"Even if it's visa violation, that doesn't mean he should have been sitting at the airport for 48 hours and transferred to Chicago, away from his family, where it will take several days or weeks to reunite them,\" Zakaria said. \nWhen unaccompanied minors are denied entry to the United States at an airport, a couple of things can happen. Officials can send them back to their home countries if relatives can care for them, or they can be sent to an Office of Refugee Resettlement shelter. \nImmigration authorities sent Mohammad to such a shelter in Chicago, despite the fact his parents live in Jordan and his brother lives in Katy. There are also several similar juvenile immigration shelters in Texas that are typically used to temporarily house unaccompanied minors who enter the country through the southern border. \nMana Yegani, a Houston-based immigration attorney, said case-workers at the shelters work with the minors to find family members in the hopes of reuniting them. \n\"They have to see who is this minor; do they have family members here. They do a medical exam to make sure they don't have diseases - that's why it takes some time for a family to be reunited,\" Yegani said. \"It also depends how backed up they are at the camps, or how well staffed they are. I've had situations where people were released in two weeks to family and situations where it took months.\" \nBut Olivas said such prolonged detainment is more typical for unaccompanied children sneaking into the country than for visa holders. \n\"If someone is caught slipping in from Canada or the southern border or tried to sneak in, that's different,\" Olivas said. \"But it's unusual for someone who appears to have a legitimate nonimmigrant visa that he's executed more than once to be in this situation. It's unusual, but it's not completely unheard of.\" \nOlivas and Zakaria said Mohammad's visa violation is minor, like a jay-walking or parking ticket. But because travelers from Muslim-majority countries are going through extra scrutiny, more detentions over relatively benign visa issues could become more common. \n\"Because it's being looked at so carefully and because Mohammad is from a Muslim country - even if it's an ally - he was caught up in it,\" Olivas said. \"I think it's admirable someone wants to come here and go to school, and if he had simply been advised that he can't do this but here are some options, that would have cured it. But this seems excessively cautious.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:55:32.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
