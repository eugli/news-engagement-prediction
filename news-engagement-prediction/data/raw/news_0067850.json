Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Ado Ekiti, had unfrozen Governor Ayodele Fayose’s accounts forthwith. \nMr. Fayose’s account was initially frozen by the EFCC for his alleged role in the misappropriation of billions of Naira from the office of the National Security Adviser. \nMr. Ozekhome said the unfreezing order allowed the governor to operate his account before transferring the sum of N75 million to his chambers’ account. \nHe further argued that the EFCC’s application and the subsequent order were based on non-compliance with court rules and judicial authorities regulating the granting of ex-parte application. \n“The entire gamut of the application leading to the granting of the interim order ex-parte amounts to forum shopping and a calculated attempt to over-reach me.” \nHe submitted that the issue, whether the said sum formed proceeds of a crime, was currently on appeal. \nJustice Anka adjourned the suit to March 2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:34:10.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
