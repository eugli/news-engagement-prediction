Bouye, the classic late-bloomer, is set to become a very rich man in a few weeks.\nComing out of Tucker High school in 2010, Bouye had exactly one college scholarship offer.\n“There were some small schools,” Bouye told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recently. “Some small schools. UCF offered me. I know that I talked to West Virginia. They came late or whatever. It wasn’t that many schools when I think about it, but UCF offered me and I took it.”\nBouye, who was roommates with future Falcons’ draft pick Kemal Ishmael, didn’t play much until his junior season for task master George O’Leary. He went undrafted in 2013 and was invited to the Falcons’ locals day.\nHe later signed with the Houston Texans. After working his way up the depth chart and turning in a spectacular season, the 6-foot, 186-pound defensive back is set to land a lucrative deal during the upcoming free agency period, which starts on March 7.\n“I’m just trying to be in the best situation possible,” Bouye said. “I really haven’t thought about it that much. I guess I will when everything gets closer. Maybe I do need to start looking things and what not, but (there’s) no telling about what is going to happen. I’m just being patient with it. But really I’m just looking to get into the best situation.”\nThe Falcons’ No. 1 priority is signing cornerback Desmond Trufant to a contract extension. They are happy with the play of cornerbacks Robert Alford, Brian Poole and Jalen Collins and will not be a player in the Bouye sweepstakes.\nHowever, he’s expected to have several suitors.\n“A.J. is a versatile player,” said Frederick Lyles, Bouye’s agent. “Any team that he goes to he’s going to give them a variety of options of where they want to play him. Whether if they want to play him inside, outside or if they want to play him in the safety spot.\n“He can do it all. He’s showed that he’s physical and mentally versatile enough to learn the various positions in the defensive backfield. Whatever team he ends up with he’s going to be an asset for sure.”\nBouey started only eight games over his first three seasons in the NFL, but last season was pressed into duty. He started 11 games and had on interception and 16 passes breakups.\nHe graded as the third-best cornerback in the league byehind Denver’s Chris Harris and Aquib Talib, according to profootbalfocus.com.\nBouye, 25, would like to return to Houston, but could land a deal similar to the five-year, $62.5 million the Giants paid Janoris Jenkins last season. The top paid cornerback in the league is Washington’s Josh Norman, who has an average salary of $15 million per year.\nBouye doesn’t seemed too concern about his pending move to a higher tax bracket or what team he lands with.\n“I don’t really care about the scheme,” Bouye said. “I just play football. Whatever they need me to do, I’ll work at it. If I’m not good at something, I’ll just work on it. It’s not really much to me. I just go out there and play football. I can play press. I can play off and I can tackle. Also, I’ve gotten more physical.”\nHe’s not sure what teams he will visit.\n“That’s down the road,” Bouye said. “I’m not worried about that. I’ve just been vacationing and spending time with my daughter (Zoe). Also, just staying on top of working out and keeping my body right. There isn’t anything to worry about since it’s not here yet.\nBouye believes his days under O’Leary, the former Georgia Tech coach, prepared him for the NFL.\n“Me and Kemal came in the same year,” Bouye said. “He got drafted in the seventh round. It was tough for him, too. But we were used it to because at UCF coach O’Leary used to be on us like crazy and that helped us.”\nHe also remembers his brief time with the Falcons.\n“It was just another opportunity to take advantage of,” Bouye said. “I learned from what I did in Atlanta from the workout. It was good just to see how it was to deal with the coaches when they put us on the board.\n“It kind of helped me with what to expect my rookie year while transitioning. From there, it was just learning every year from my past mistakes, working on them and getting better, while still building on what I did the year before. I guess that it’s all coming together now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:14:38.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
