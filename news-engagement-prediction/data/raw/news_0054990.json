They also must refrain from physically blocking, impeding or obstructing any persons from seeking or taking... a lawful horse-carriage ride” or face jail time and fines.\nSEE IT: Animal rights activist shoves NYC horse carriage driver \n“Make no mistake: the content of the speech is not at issue here, the manner of delivery is,” Engoron writes.\nTags: animals central park  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:36:55.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
