Credit Fernando Llano/Associated Press CARACAS, Venezuela — The Trump administration announced sanctions against Venezuela ’s vice president on Monday, calling him a drug “kingpin” in its first moves against the country’s leftist government that President Trump railed against during his campaign. Vice President Tareck El Aissami, according to a Treasury Department statement , was being sanctioned for “playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking.” The sanctions mean that Mr. El Aissami, 42, will be blocked from financial dealings with Americans and will have any American assets frozen. Such actions against officials in the government of President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela are nothing new in a long and fraught relationship between Washington and Caracas. But the accusation that Mr. El Aissami, the next in line for the presidency, was a drug trafficker was certain to set a new, more hostile tone in relations. “This can be seen as the opening salvo of the Trump administration in dealing with Latin America’s deepest crisis,” said Michael Shifter, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a policy group in Washington. “It is hard to imagine that, with this decision, Washington will now be inclined to offer many carrots to the increasingly authoritarian regime.” Since taking office, Mr. Trump has come under increasing pressure by both Republicans and some Democrats to take a tougher stance on Venezuela, which has suffered an economic collapse punctuated by food and medicine shortages and soaring crime, even as its government has taken a harsher stance against dissent. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In a letter on Feb. 8, 34 members of the United States Congress urged the president to “take immediate action to sanction regime officials.” The Treasury Department document contained wide-ranging accusations against Mr. El Aissami, the result of years of investigation, officials said. “Power and influence do not protect those who engage in these illicit activities,” said John E. Smith, the acting director of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. “Denying a safe haven for illicit assets in the United States and protecting the U.S. financial system from abuse remain top priorities of the Treasury Department.” Venezuelan officials had no immediate public comment on Monday evening. Mr. Maduro did not mention it during a television address. In its announcement, the Treasury Department said Mr. El Aissami’s history of drug trafficking went back years through his previous political positions, which included a state governorship and establishing a national police force at the Interior and Justice Ministry.
