It’s believed they were trying to steal it. \nHowever, Watson’s arm was caught in the seatbelt, and as the assailants drove away he was dragged along the street for 500 to 600 yards. \nThe attackers, who had covered their faces with caps and had their hoods up, then abandoned the attempted robbery.

The incident left him with brain damage. \nHe added: ‘From everything that I’ve seen with Michael – from his injuries and the suffering from his boxing career – this made everything we’ve gone through so far seem minor. \n‘I just wish I’d have been able to help Micahel, but I was fighting for my life and I just didn’t expect it at all.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T22:12:07.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
