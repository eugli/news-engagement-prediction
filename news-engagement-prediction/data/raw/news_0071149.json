He claimed he would hand over the drugs to clients at the parking building of the condominium. \nIn a subsequent search of Pol L/Cpl Pitsanupong's room No 615/76 in that condominium, the police allegedly found two 9mm pistols with some ammunition. \nInformation from him led the NSB police to seize another 80kg of ice from the Thian Thale area, but nobody was arrested. \nShortly afterwards, two more suspects were arrested at Don Mueang airport. Pol L/Cpl Pitsanupong allegedly said on being arrested that the drugs he was delivering to clients belonged to them. \nThe two, who had not been identified, were taken to the NSB headquarters for questioning.
