How come we don’t remember it? \n“THE more things change, the more they stay the same.”\nI used to think this phrase merely sounded clever. But if we go by Sean Owczarek’s definition, “Sometimes what we perceive as a significant change is really not so significant, and vice versa. Or a series of ground-breaking events can cycle back to a state eerily reminiscent of their beginning”, then I think it aptly describes what’s happening in Malaysia.\nThis hit me when I revisited what National Geographic magazine wrote about our country in 1977 and 1997.\nOlder Malaysians seem to recall the 1970s, perhaps with rose-tinted glasses, as a time when our society was more inclusive and communities were more comfortable with each other.\nBut the 1977 article in NatGeo ’s May issue, headlined Malaysia: Youthful nation with growing pains by William S. Ellis, shows otherwise.\nMalaysia was little known to the world, especially in the West, and Ellis had a lengthy stay to learn about its history, government, economy, environment and, of course, its people.\nWe were then a nation of about 12 million, comprising 50% Malays and Chinese 34%, and an economy largely reliant on rubber, tin, palm oil, timber and petroleum.\nThe greatest threat to national security was still the Malayan Communist Party’s campaign of insurgency led by Chin Peng which had resulted in the assassinations of Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Abdul Rahman Hashim and Perak Police Chief Tan Sri Khoo Chong Kong and the bombing of the National Monument.\nBy then, the New Economic Policy, a result of the 1969 race riots, had been in place six years. \nIts goal, among other things, was to enable the Malays and other bumiputras to control 30% of the national wealth by 1990.\nTo achieve that, Ellis noted, it became “official government policy to favour Malays and indigenous tribes in social and economic matters” because the NEP was basically “an affirmative action, pro-Malay economic policy” as Prof A. H. Roslan from Universiti Utara Malaysia puts it in his 2001 paper, Income Inequality, Poverty and Development Policy in Malaysia. \nFor the non-bumiputras, namely the Chinese and the Indians, it was better to accept than fight the NEP since it promised to enlarge the economic pie so that the bumi share would increase without taking anything from the non-bumis.\nThe reality of it, however, wasn’t so clear-cut. And the Chinese community, in particular, felt the brunt of the NEP’s pro-bumi affirmative policies during those early years.\nEllis quotes an unnamed Chinese man in his 30s living in Kuala Terengganu who, to him, must have represented the community’s sentiments. The man tells Ellis he feels there is nothing to hope for because of the discrimination.\nHe agrees the Malays deserve help because the majority of them are very poor and their special position is written in the Constitution, but says the affirmative policies should have started slowly, over a long period of time, to allow for adjustments all around.\n“It’s one thing to close the door slowly on the Chinese, and another to slam it in his face,” he adds.\nIt was that underlying racial tension that Ellis caught. His conclusion: “Whatever happens in Malaysia with its ethnic jumble, it is not likely that a miracle of harmony will emerge.”\nThat was NatGeo ’s story of Malaysia in 1977: a young nation rich in natural resources and great potential but driven by a pro-Malay economic policy that affected racial harmony. Twenty years on, NatGeo ’s returned to Malaysia and found a nation that seemed to have defied Ellis’ prediction. \nWe were a miracle of harmony after all; a Rising Star – as the article was headlined in the August 1997 issue – “one of the fastest developing nations in Southeast Asia.”\nWriter T. R. Reid marvelled at “the nation of 21 million (that) is riding on a wave of high-tech prosperity that reflects a stunning economic transition.”\nFrom a raw commodities exporter in 1977, Malaysia had become “the world’s greatest exporter of semiconductors” in 1997.\nReid writes that this economic transformation “has accompanied, and probably encouraged, a strong sense of community that has greatly reduced the ethnic animosities that once made Malaysia a tense battle zone of competing racial groups.”\nHe quotes a Johorean, Venugopal Dharan, as saying, “More than ever in my life we are feeling Malaysian now.”\nThe government officer adds, “When I was in school here, we felt we were Indians. Always we were Indians, who happened to be living in a country with a lot of Malays and Chinese. But my children! Always they are saying, ‘We are Malaysians’.”\nReid goes on to say economic prosperity and social harmony had “created an enormous sense of national pride – pride that literally soars to the heavens”, in reference to the world’s tallest flagpole in Dataran Merdeka and the Petronas Twin Towers, then the world’s highest buildings.\nHe shares the story of his Malaysian Chinese friend, Jenny Tan, who came from a very poor background and had left to work overseas only to return when her mother wrote to her telling her “anybody can get a job here now.”\nJenny tells Reid, “Everything (is) getting better.” Even though the NEP did not end in 1990 and merely morphed into the National Development Policy with the same affirmative practices intact, all was forgiven because the economic pie had indeed grown.\nReid reinforces that positive perception when he closes his article with the wedding reception of a Chinese factory custom clerk and a karaoke club hostess. \nThe groom’s brother excitedly tells him, “The next generation will be much better off than we are! Lots of opportunity! Successful!”\nAnd the reason why Reid’s article on Malaysia is called rising star? \nHe kept hearing a government TV ad that went, “All together, Mah-lay-see-ah, you can be a star.”\nFor the life of me, I can’t recall such a patriotic song from the 1990s.\nThe one that I recall fondly is Setia , the only government-issued song that was an unofficial number one hit with all Malaysians at a time when no one felt their loyalty was being questioned.\nIn 2017, we seem to have lost that lovin’ feeling. It feels as if we are back in 1977.\nThe heady economic success of the 1990s perhaps masked the fact that we never really sorted out our “ethnic jumble” and when things got wobbly, the goodwill evaporated. \nBy almost all accounts, our race relations are at an all-time low and doubt, suspicion and resentment have come back with a vengeance.\nWhat is different is that communists are no longer our biggest security threat which, back then, lent some credence to the mistrust of the Chinese. \nThe enemy is now the Islamic State, but that has not changed the attitude towards the Chinese community as the ones to fear and be careful of. \nAdd the frightening use of religious issues to further divide and rule, and we have a very toxic situation that, if not stopped, could very well poison race relations beyond repair and forever destroy our chance of a true miracle of harmony.\nI wonder what NatGeo would make of Malaysia at 60. \nWe aren’t a young nation anymore and there are 31 million of us now, but we all seem to be suffering from self-inflicted middle age pains.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:56:54.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
