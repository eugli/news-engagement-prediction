I wish there was a simple solution,\" he said. RCMP loads asylum-seeker's baby stroller into cruiser 0:53 \nCurtis shakes the hand of his Canadian counterpart for the cameras, careful not to step over the invisible line that divides them. \nOnly a half an hour earlier, a family with a baby crossed that line in the February sunshine. \nAgents reassured the family members as they were taken into custody to head to a processing centre. \nA Mountie loaded bags and a baby carriage into the back of a police vehicle before it drove off. \nRCMP Staff Sgt. Brian Byrne, who works with the border integrity program, said it's moving to see what these families go through. \n\"I'm a father of two myself,\" he said. \n\"Some of these people have long journeys.

This is one of the places where asylum-seekers have been crossing into Canada. (Jaela Bernstien/CBC) \nFamilies such as the one that arrived on Monday morning are taken to a building near the official border crossing in Lacolle, seven kilometres away. \nInside they'll be interviewed, fingerprinted, asked to fill out some paperwork and then, more often than not, the new arrivals are released on a promise to appear at their refugee hearing. \nInland enforcement officer Dominique Fillion said there are three reasons they will detain people who have crossed illegally: If they don't have proper documentation and therefore can't be identified, if they are deemed to be a threat, or if there's reason to believe they won't show up for their hearing. \nOtherwise, they're allowed to walk away after processing. \nBorder agents say refugees can stay with family or friends, or they're given a list of shelters where they can stay until their hearing date.
