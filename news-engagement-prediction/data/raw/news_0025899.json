Communications between the two continued after Trump's victory on Nov. 8, according to officials with access to intelligence reports on the matter. \nKislyak, in a brief interview with The Post, confirmed having contacts with Flynn before and after the election, but he declined to say what was discussed. \nFor Yates and other officials, concerns about the communications peaked in the days after the Obama administration on Dec. 29 announced measures to punish Russia for what it said was the Kremlin's interference in the election to help Trump. \nAfter the sanctions were rolled out, the Obama administration braced itself for the Russian retaliation. To the surprise of many U.S. officials, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on Dec. 30 that there would be no response. Trump praised the decision on Twitter. \nIntelligence analysts began to search for clues that could help explain Putin's move. The search turned up Kislyak's communications, which the FBI routinely monitors, and the phone call in question with Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general with years of intelligence experience. \nFrom that call and subsequent intercepts, FBI agents wrote a secret report summarizing Flynn's discussions with Kislyak. \nYates, then the deputy attorney general, considered Flynn's comments in the intercepted call to be \"highly significant\" and \"potentially illegal,\" according to an official familiar with her thinking. \nYates and other intelligence officials suspected that Flynn could be in violation of an obscure U.S. statute known as the Logan Act, which bars U.S. citizens from interfering in diplomatic disputes with another country. \nAt the same time, Yates and other law enforcement officials knew there was little chance of bringing against Flynn a case related to the Logan Act, a statute that has never been used in a prosecution. In addition to the legal and political hurdles, Yates and other officials were aware of an FBI investigation looking at possible contacts between Trump associates and Russia, which now included the Flynn-Kislyak communications. \nWord of the calls leaked out on Jan. 12 in an op-ed by Post columnist David Ignatius. \"What did Flynn say, and did it undercut U.S. sanctions?\" Ignatius wrote, citing the Logan Act. \nThe next day, a Trump transition official told The Post, \"I can tell you that during his call, sanctions were not discussed whatsoever.\" \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer , in a conference call with reporters on Jan. 13, said that the conversation between Flynn and Kislyak had \"centered on the logistics\" of a post-inauguration call between Trump and Putin. \"That was it, plain and simple,\" Spicer added. \nOn Jan. 15, Pence was asked about the phone call during an appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" Citing a conversation he had with Flynn, Pence said the incoming national security adviser and Kislyak \"did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.\" \nBefore the Pence statement on Jan. 15, top Justice Department and intelligence officials had discussed whether the incoming Trump White House should be notified about the contents of the Flynn-Kislyak communications. \nPence's statement on CBS made the issue more urgent, current and former officials said, because U.S. intelligence agencies had reason to believe that Russia was aware that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed sanctions in their December call, contrary to public statements. \nThe internal debate over how to handle the intelligence on Flynn and Kislyak came to a head on Jan. 19, Obama's last full day in office. \nYates, Clapper and Brennan argued for briefing the incoming administration so the new president could decide how to deal with the matter. The officials discussed options, including telling Pence, the incoming White House counsel, the incoming chief of staff or Trump himself.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:49:45.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
