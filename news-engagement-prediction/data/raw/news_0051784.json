But, during a media Q&A, the team explained that they feel encouraged by the recent instructions, and 'don't consider this a ton of extra work.' Ultimately, they say it will make for a 'more robust program,' whether its manned or unmanned. The results are set to be completed early this spring, and the researchers stress that in making any decisions, they will 'let the data drive us and let the information drive us.' Last week, it was revealed that NASA's acting administrator instructed top staff to dramatically speed up plans to send mankind beyond the orbit of Earth for the first time since 1972. Robert Lightfoot, who was previously the space agency's acting Associate Administrator, has asked staff to initiate a study to assess the feasibility of adding a crew to Exploration Mission-1, the first integrated flight of the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. By moving the manned mission up, commentators say it could give President Trump a 'Nixonesque' moment - and also prove the worth of Nasa's SLS megarocket as it vies for funding. 'The SLS and Orion missions, coupled with record levels of private investment in space, will help put NASA and America in a position to unlock the mysteries of space and to ensure this nation’s world preeminence in exploring the cosmos,' NASA said. Nasa's Orion, stacked on a Space Launch System rocket capable of lifting 70 metric tons will launch from a newly refurbished Kennedy Space Center in November 2018. The study, headed by Bill Gerstenmaier, associate administrator for the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, will examine the opportunities it could present to accelerate the effort of the first crewed flight and what it would take to accomplish that first step of pushing humans farther into space. According to the Washington Post, Lightfoot sent a note to employees revealing the plan, saying: 'I know the challenges associated with such a proposition, like reviewing the technical feasibility, additional resources needed, and clearly the extra work would require a different launch date. 'That said, I also want to hear about the opportunities it could present to accelerate the effort of the first crewed flight and what it would take to accomplish that first step of pushing humans farther into space.' Astronauts haven't gone beyond a low orbit around Earth since 1972, when NASA ended its Apollo program. Bob Walker, an adviser to the Trump transition team and a former congressman who chaired the House Science Committee, told the Post 'What I hear being discussed is the potential for sometime within the first Trump term being able to go and do an Apollo 8 mission' - meaning a lunar orbit mission like the one performed by Apollo 8 in December 1968. The mission plan for the flight is built around a profile called a multi-translunar injection (MTLI), or multiple departure burns, and includes a free return trajectory from the moon. HOW THE HISTORIC MANNED MISSION WILL WORK NASA's original plan for the manned mission is built around a profile called a multi-translunar injection (MTLI), or multiple departure burns, and includes a free return trajectory from the moon. Basically, the spacecraft will circle our planet twice while periodically firing its engines to build up enough speed to push it toward the moon before looping back to Earth. After launch, the spacecraft and upper stage of the rocket will first orbit Earth twice to ensure its systems are working normally. Orion will reach a circular orbit at an altitude of 100 nautical miles and last 90 minutes. The move or burn to get the spacecraft into a specific orbit around a planet or other body in space is called orbital insertion. Following the first orbit, the rocket's powerful exploration upper stage (EUS) and four RL-10 engines will perform an orbital raise, which will place Orion into a highly elliptical orbit around our planet. The mission will send crew around the backside of the moon where they will ultimately create a figure eight before Orion returns to Earth. Instead of requiring propulsion on the return, the spacecraft will use the moon's gravitational pull like a slingshot to bring Orion home, which is the free return portion of the trajectory. Crew will fly thousands of miles beyond the moon, which is an average of 230,000 miles beyond the Earth. This is called the partial translunar injection. This second, larger orbit will take approximately 24 hours with Orion flying in an ellipse between 500 and 19,000 nautical miles above Earth. For perspective, the International Space Station orbits Earth from about 250 miles above. Once the integrated vehicle completes these two orbits, the EUS will separate from Orion and any payloads selected and mounted inside the rocket's universal stage adapter will be released. The payloads will then fly on their own to conduct their unique missions. After the EUS separation, the crew will do a unique test of Orion's critical systems. They will gather and evaluate engineering data from their day-long orbit before using Orion's service module to complete a second and final propulsion move called the translunar injection (TLI) burn. This second burn will put Orion on a path toward the moon, and will conclude the 'multi-translunar injection' portion of the mission. 'This would be another precursor to ultimately landing,' Walker said. 'And I think sometime within a second Trump term, you could think about putting a landing vehicle on the moon.' The European Space Agency and aerospace company Airbus have already delivered the propulsion and supply module for the unmanned flight of NASA's new Orion spacecraft next year. Last week it was announced ESA and Airbus have now agreed with NASA to build a module for a second, manned mission that will fly around the moon as early as 2021 - which could now be pushed forward. The Service Module provides propulsion, electrical power, water and thermal control as well as maintaining the oxygen and nitrogen atmosphere for the crew. The first Orion with the service module will be launched in late 2018 on NASA's new Space Launch System. Subjects in the simulation were fitted with advanced crew escape suits as they carried out tests to determine how well they could see the display and controls as the craft vibrated atop the Space Launch System rocket An expanded view of the next configuration of NASA's Space Launch System rocket, including the four RL10 engines, giving it enought power to take man into deep space The month-long mission will be unmanned and will orbit the Moon before returning to Earth, testing the spacecraft and rocket before carrying astronauts. The European Service Module is designed, built and assembled by a team of companies from 11 countries led by Airbus Space & Defence, based on proven technology from ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle that flew to the International Space Station five times with supplies. The mission and collaboration with NASA is part of ESA's vision to prepare for future voyages of exploration further into the Solar System, and continues the spirit of international cooperation that forms the foundation of the International Space Station. Earlier this month NASA engineers simulated what it will be like inside of the Orion spacecraft during launch when it takes off on its first manned mission as early as 2021. Subjects in the simulation were fitted with advanced crew escape suits as they carried out tests to determine how well they could see the display and controls as the craft vibrated atop the Space Launch System rocket. APOLLO 17: THE LAST TIME MAN LEFT EARTH ORBIT On December 19, 1972, humans returned from another celestial body for the last time following the last Apollo mission. In this photo, astronaut Eugene Cernan walks toward the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) near the U.S. flag at the Taurus-Littrow landing site of Apollo 17. The photograph was taken by astronaut Harrison H. Schmitt, lunar module pilot. Cernan was the last human being to step on the moon as he was entered the Lunar Module after Schmitt for the return flight to earth. Apollo 17 blasted off on December 6, 1972 - the United States' final manned mission to the moon, and first nighttime launch. 'Apollo 17 built upon all of the other missions scientifically,' said Gene Cernan, the mission's commander, and the last man to walk on the moon, in 2008. 'We had a lunar rover, we were able to cover more ground than most of the other missions. We stayed there a little bit longer. We went to a more challenging unique area in the mountains, to learn something about the history and the origin of the moon itself.' On their way to the moon, the Apollo 17 crew took one of the most iconic photographs in space-program history, the image of the Earth dubbed 'The Blue Marble.' The Apollo 17 mission saw Cernan and his fellow astronauts land the Challenger on the moon where they would spend the next three days exploring and taking samples. It set new records for longest manned lunar landing flight, longest time in lunar orbit, longest time in lunar extravehicular activities and biggest lunar sample return. During that time, Captain Cernan logged 566 hours and 15 minutes in space-of which more than 73 hours were spent on the surface of the moon. While he and lunar module pilot Harrison H. (Jack) Schmitt conducted activities on the lunar surface, command module pilot Ronald Evans remained in orbit. At the end of the mission, Cernan was the last to board the spacecraft, making him the last man to walk on the moon. While on the Moon, Cernan he and Schmitt performed three EVAs (Extravehicular Activities) for a total of about 22 hours of exploration of the Taurus–Littrow valley. Their first EVA alone was more than three times the length Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin spent outside their spacecraft on Apollo 11. Cernan piloted the rover on its final outing, recording a maximum speed of 11.2 mph - giving him the unofficial lunar land speed record. The first mission is set to launch in 2018, and while this was supposed to be uncrewed, the space agency has plans to send astronauts aboard Orion just four years from now. The researchers at NASA are working to understand how Orion's launch vibrations will affect an astronaut's ability to see the displays and operate controls. In the simulation, subjects sat in the latest design of the seat, atop the crew impact attenuation system. According to the space agency, the achievement marks the first time this hardware was brought together for this type of assessment. These efforts will help to ensure the spacecraft is ready for its first manned mission, which could come as soon as 2021. more videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:36:00.322+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
