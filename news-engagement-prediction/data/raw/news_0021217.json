[Photo from Sina Weibo]\nLike father, like son. Three generations of a family have all worked for China's railways, a mirror of the country's development from steam power to internal combustion engines and finally to electricity.\nJiang Fulin was among the family's first generation of train drivers. Working for a Nanjing unit under Shanghai Railway Administration beginning in 1956, he traveled across the country with steam trains for the next 27 years.\nHis son Jiang Aishun recalled that his father used to come back with dirty clothes but leave home and return to work again with clean ones thanks to his mother.\nThe son was also fascinated with the sound of trains, so he followed in his father's footsteps to become a train driver, although steam was replaced with more powerful internal combustion and electricity engines. He no longer worried about dirty clothes.\nThe third generation, Qu Junjie, who holds his mother's family name, continued the passion for trains since a young age.\nBut his father Jiang Aishun didn't support his career choice at the beginning as he thought the work was quite tiring and required constant night shifts.\nQu insisted and became a driver in 2011 on a high-speed train.\nThese three generations have driven trains for a combined 56 years, witnessing great strides in China's railway industry.\nThe combined length of China's high speed railways surpassed 22,000 kilometers by the end of 2016, with the total national railway length now stretching 124,000 kilometers, according to China Railway Corp.\nPrevious Page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next Page Previous Page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:36:34.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
