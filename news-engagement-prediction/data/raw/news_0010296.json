He made sure to let NFL commissioner Roger Goodell know he's still steamed about Deflategate.Â \nAfter Kraft received the Vince Lombardi Trophy from Goodell after New England's classic 34-28 overtime victory over Atlanta, he barely look at the commissioner as they shook hands. Then he delivered not-so-veiled shots at his friend-turned-nemesis. \n\"A lot has transpired over the last two years,\" he said with Goodell in the background, \"and that needs no explanation.\" pats owner robert kraft calls fifth #superbowl title \"unequivocally the sweetest\" pic.twitter.com/kD6SltDNSv â adelle.

Fans booed Goodell ferociously during the introduction, and then Kraft jumped in.
