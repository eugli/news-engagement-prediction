A protest was also planned for West Palm Beach, Florida, with organizers hoping the marchers would reach Trump's Mar-a-Lago club, where he is spending the weekend. There was a variety of themes at the protests. Some people voiced objection to the President's proposed border wall. In other places people spoke out for rights for refugees, immigrants and LGBT Americans. The gatherings took place one day after a federal judge in Washington state issued a temporary stay on the President's immigration ban executive order. Read More The White House quickly responded in a statement, saying the Justice Department will fight to block the order \"at the earliest possible time.\" Here is what was happening around the nation Saturday. Washington Protesters walked along Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to the US Capitol to \"deliver a clear message to the doorsteps of President Trump, members of Congress, and the courts,\" according to a Facebook event page. At the front of the pack, participants held a banner across the front row saying, \"No Ban,\" referring Trump's January 29 executive order that temporarily bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.

He is also concerned that something would happen if he went overseas and tried to return. \"I have a life here. I have a business here. It is so scary,\" he said. Christine Montgomery, born and raised in the capital, said many immigrants marched alongside her African-American family and friends in the Washington \"Black Lives Matter\" protests. \"Before, they were sympathizing with us. Now they're empathizing with us, \" she said. Melissa Jackson agreed, saying Trump is ironically uniting Americans with his executive orders. \"With him in office, he's really bringing this country together,\" she said, pointing to the crowd's diversity. New York CNN affiliate WABC reported thousands of people congregated in Greenwich Village at the Stonewall National Monument, voicing opposition to the stances of the White House on LGBT issues. Stonewall was the country's first national monument honoring the LGBT movement. WABC reported organizers called for a rally when a draft of an executive order circulated this week that would have curbed LGBT rights. \"This is an unpredictable White House that makes very erratic policy decisions ... so we believe we have to be out in front of these fights,\" said Zeke Stokes, vice president of programs for GLAAD, an LGBT activist group. #stonewall rally pic.twitter.com/QiUOhsCj1m \n— CeFaan Kim (@CeFaanKim) February 4, 2017 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke at the rally, leading several \"Dump Trump\" chants.
