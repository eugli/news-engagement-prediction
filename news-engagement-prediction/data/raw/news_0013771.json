In a recent survey from Public Policy Polling, 40 percent of voters want to see him impeached, which is a five percent jump from last week&apos;s poll. It&apos;s difficult to pinpoint why exactly people want to see him go...because there are so many reasons to choose from.\nMaybe Trump&apos;s cabinet nominations have left you scratching your head. Like, Ben Carson would make one hell of a Secretary of Taking an Emergency Cat Nap , but Secretary of Housing and Urban Development? Hey, at least, Carson is going to have Steve Harvey working alongside him , right? Crisis averted.\nRelated With Inaugural Speech, Trump Concern-Trolled America Trump Is Doing Exactly What He Said He Would: Dehumanizing Muslims Donald Trump’s Dangerous Obsession With Chicago Maybe his executive orders—i.e. the Muslim ban —have made you increasingly concerned about the direction of this country over the next four years.\nPublic views of Trump executive orders now mostly negative. Including so-called Muslim ban. https://t.co/sWeU6w52xm pic.twitter.com/Nwkd5UxW02\n— Catherine Rampell (@crampell) February 2, 2017 Maybe when discussing a wall and boatloads of cash in the same sentence, the only thing you choose to acknowledge is that new game show on NBC. Maybe you&apos;re fed up hearing the term \" alternative facts .\" The list goes on and on.\nThe least shocking results from Public Policy Polling reveal that 52 percent of Americans would rather have Barack Obama serving as President, as opposed to the 43 percent who can honestly look in the mirror and say they are \"glad\" to have Trump right now.\nTags: News , Donald Trump", "external_links": ["https://t.co/Nwkd5UxW02", "https://twitter.com/zaymarty", "http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2017/02/after-2-weeks-voters-yearn-for-obama.html", "http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-ben-carson-iowa", "https://t.co/sWeU6w52xm", "https://twitter.com/crampell/status/827226929338122240", "http://www.nbc.com/the-wall?nbc=1"], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:44:20.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
