Michele Pihera said.\nPolice say York’s car jumped a curb and hit Jose Coreas-Mejia, 16, and his cousin Joel Melendez-Coreas, 18, along Stonewood Drive.\nCoreas-Mejia was seriously injured in the crash and taken to Gwinnett Medical Center in Lawrenceville. Melendez-Coreas was treated and released.\nThere was no update on the 16-year-old’s condition Tuesday.\nRELATED: Officer tried to pass car before accident\nOfficials say York was responding to a personal injury traffic accident, which is considered a Code 2 response. According to section 440.02 of the department’s general directives manual, during a Code 2 response an officer can have “intermittent use of emergency lights and siren is authorized to proceed through intersections and congested areas ... at no time shall the posted speed limit be exceeded.”\nPolice concluded that York was going 97 mph based on the marks on the pavement and black box data. His blue lights and siren were also activated at the time.\nAccording to police, York was on a four-lane road when he told investigators he traveled to the center lane to pass another car. But at the same time, the car started merging into the center lane.\nYork then swerved to the opposite side of the road to avoid a collision, but he lost control of the car.\nHe also hit one silver and one black Honda Accord. The black Honda Accord was pushed into a house and damaged an exterior wall.\nNo charges have been filed against York, but they likely could come later this week, Pihera said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:01:40.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
