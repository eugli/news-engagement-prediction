It's a policing organisation like no other in the UK, with a budget of £3bn, a workforce of 43,000 and responsibility for keeping everyone in London - from Barking to Buckingham Palace, from West Norwood to Westminster - safe.\nThe leader of Britain's biggest and most influential police force will come under pressure to make early decisions: on whether to roll out controversial spit-guards, on how to police the Notting Hill Carnival and if Tasers should be extended to all officers.\nShe'll face intense scrutiny from the media, which has a tendency to escalate stories of local difficulties into ones of national importance. And she'll be expected to provide regular updates to the London Assembly, MPs on the home affairs committee, the mayor of London and the home secretary.\nFive challenges for the new chief\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd said Ms Dick was \"an exceptional leader\" with a \"clear vision\" for the future of the Met and an \"understanding of the diverse range of communities it serves\".\n\"She now takes on one of the most demanding, high-profile and important jobs in UK policing, against the backdrop of a heightened terror alert and evolving threats from fraud and cyber crime.\"\nSir Bernard described his replacement as a \"very talented person\" and said she had achieved an \"incredible amount and deserves this post\".\nHe added: \"Cressida Dick is the first female Commissioner of the Met Police and will be a brilliant beacon for women within and beyond this force.\"\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said she was the \"best possible person\" to take the Met forward.\nHe said: \"She has already had a long and distinguished career, and her experience and ability has shone throughout this process. On behalf of all Londoners, I warmly welcome Cressida to the role.\"\nMs Dick was 'gold command' on the day Jean Charles de Menezes was shot dead But Mr de Menezes' cousins Patricia Armani and Alex Pereira said her appointment was \"offensive\" to his memory and sent \"the message... that police officers can act with impunity\".\nMs Armani said: \"Our family is disappointed that she has now been appointed for such an important role at a time there are many more threats to public security in the form of terrorism.\n\"What are the guarantees that more innocent people won't be killed by the police in London?\"\nRigby killing Ms Dick's new post commands a salary of £270,648, plus benefits.\nShe first joined the Met in 1983 after a brief spell in accountancy following her graduation from Oxford University.\nIn 2009, she became the first woman to be appointed an assistant commissioner at the force, later becoming the national lead for counter-terrorism across the UK.\nHer work also included leading the reinvestigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and the police response to the killing of soldier Lee Rigby.\nIn 2014, she left Scotland Yard to take up a highly sensitive and undisclosed director-general post at the Foreign Office.\nHer other experience includes taking on internal reforms of Scotland Yard and being one of the two senior officers in charge of security at the London 2012 Olympic Games.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39051741", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-39049688", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A794/production/_94800924_yard_getty.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/12B5/production/_94798740_cressida_getty.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6783/production/_94799462_menezes_getty.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-22T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:54:46.642+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
