(Courtesy Aboozar Taba) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Thursday, February 2, 2017, 9:38 PM \nAn MIT scientist from Iran fears that he will soon be uprooted from his adopted home after President Trump’s order targeting Muslim countries. \nAboozar Tabatabai received his doctorate in oceanography from Rutgers University last year, though his budding academic career may be derailed if he, his pregnant wife Reyhaneh and their daughter are kicked out of the country when his visa expires in late June. \nThe 33-year-old told the Daily News recently started his job modeling ocean activity in Massachusetts last month, and was not sure whether Trump would follow through on his much-discussed restrictions for Muslim travelers until they became law. \n“The first night after the order I couldn’t sleep,” he said by phone from Cambridge. “I closed my eyes and saw nightmares.” \nCourt order allows Iranian man to beat Trump travel ban \nMuch of the attention around the \"travel ban\" centered around the detention of green card holders, who Trump’s administration has may be allowed back into the country after reaching the border. \nNot discussed are those on all the other types of visas such as Tabatabai, who post-student training status currently allows him to live and work in the U.S. \nTabatabai said that the U.S. Embassy for Iran told him that it can process neither the extension he wants nor a visa for highly skilled workers visa (H1B) that his employer could try to get for him during Trump’s 90-day suspension on visa issuance. \nA State Department spokesman told the Daily News that it would not comment on the specifics of the case, but confirmed the 90-day ban and said that the order did not affect the status of anyone currently legally residing in the U.S. President Trump's order put a 90-day ban on visa issuance to Iranian nationals. (Evan Vucci/AP) \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services did not immediately respond to requests for clarification about how the ban applies. \nThe Marine Biological Laboratory’s Dr. Joseph Vallino told the News that Tabatabai’s particular set of scientific skills and expertise are hard to find, and that most of the applicants for similar positions are from outside the U.S. \nThough his work could help increase understanding and keep people safe during disasters such as hurricanes, the father has been labeled as potentially dangerous by the Trump administration \n“Processes for Iranians have always been brutal,” Tabatabai said, noting that even his then 9-month-old daughter had to go to an in-person interview before he came to the U.S. in 2010. \nHe said that his mother, preparing to come over during the summer to help with the new baby, had her visa interview cancelled two days after the executive order. \nTabatabai is not alone when it comes to facing an uncertain future as his visa expires. \nDespite tensions between their governments since 1979, the International Institute of Education says that there were more than 12,000 students from Iran studying in the U.S. in the 2015-2016 school year, and many students apply for the additional year of training and work as Tabatabai did. Tabatabai said that his daughter has spent almost her entire life in the U.S. (Courtesy Aboozar Taba) \nThere were 1,901 reported from Iraq, 1,514 from Libya, 783 from Syria, 599 from Yemen, 253 from Sudan and 35 from Somalia. \nTabatabai said that he faces limited job options back in Iran because of his involvement with the U.S., but does not want to stay in the United States illegally when his visa expires. \n“It is a matter of dignity. I came here because I was invited here,” the scientist said, adding that he does not want to be a criminal in the country where he was once welcomed. \nDespite the hatred he feels from those Americans who would want to kick him out, he says that he wants to make the U.S., where his 7-year-old daughter Zahra has spent almost her entire life, his adopted home. \nHe said that he is glad she is young enough that he does not have to explain to her why people want her to leave the place where she has g \nWhile the ban has been tough psychologically for many in his community, Tabatabai that he is encouraged by the support he receives from friends and colleagues on “the good half of the country” that want him to stay. \n“That’s why I like to live in this country. That ‘s why I want to live in this country,” he said.
