Situated on the eastern slopes of the foothills to the Berkshires on the Massachusetts and New York border, it commands a modest but pretty view of rolling farmland. \"It was a labor of love and also the realization of a lifelong dream. As an architect and interior designer, I of course always want to build my own home,\" says Rolston. \"It is ultimately a very personal portrait of our collective tastes, interests and inspirations.\" \nAfter spending several years as permanent house guests at a friends' home in the area, Rolston stumbled upon Mitchell Street during a 40 mile bike ride. \"It was a stunning bright crisp spring day,\" remembers Rolston. \"The landscape was so beautiful and reminded me of Sussex where my mother spent her youth.\" The two stalked the street, going so far as to chat up the contractor working at a construction site up the road. \"He mentioned a family that owned a bunch of property. We cold called them and the rest is our little history.\" \n\"Martin and I both grew up in southern California,\" says Rolston. \"In architecture school I became obsessed with the California modernists and particularly the lesser known Gregory Ain. I was fascinated by Ain’s interest in pushing the structural limits of traditional American wood frame construction techniques. We also got fixated on the local cow barns that typically have single pitch roofs.\" \nHow 16 Doors Got Its Name \nVisitors approach the house from the base of the slope, spiraling up the driveway to the gravel path you see in this picture. \"Friends have said it's a little Deliverance cab in the woods until you get up close,\" jokes Rolston. \"The house is oriented toward the view which is west and downhill. Our home has no official front door. We call the house 16 Doors because the glazing consists of sixteen, eight foot by eight foot, sliding glass doors. and that's it. One can enter anywhere and every room has a direct connection to the exterior.\" \nRustic Materials, Refined Results \n\"During the summer that the house was under construction, we got inspired by the stacks of lumber laying around,\" says Rolston about the table he made for the space. \"It’s constructed of layered 2x4 and 2x6 pine planks that we clear lacquered. The chairs are from a cigar factory and consequently have a great tobacco laden patina; they were bought at HENRY , a store curated by the amazing artist Nancy Shaver. The stools are folding 19th century camping stools.\" \nCity Loft Living in the Wild \n\"We wanted the interiors to be comfortable but not a country cliche,\" says Rolston. \"Thus, all the clean lines and modern pieces. We always wanted to live in a loft but could never afford to in the city, so this was a little bit of an urban loft imported to the country. The wood burning stove is by the Danish company RAIS —very hygge, or cosy, as the Danish like to say.\" \nThe Key to Making Your Kitchen Seamless \n\"We really wanted the kitchen to feel like just a credenza in the room,\" says Rolston. \"Around the corner to the left is a pantry that has a counter for baking and coffee appliances and the fridge. I thought it might be an inconvenient sacrifice to have no back counter but I love it. No ugly appliances and all the convenience of a big old school pantry. \nThe Best Design Solutions Come from Unexpected Places \nAfter creating a ten-foot long console made to match the length of the sofa, Rolston decided to cover it in a patchwork of copper sheets fastened with copper rivets. \"We were inspired by Paul Evans craft period in the seventies. The copper came from the local hardware store and is just roofing flashing!\" \nThe Best Mural Walls Are a Curated Mix \nIn the master bedroom, Rolston hung a mix of family framed portraits with medical diagrams for rhinoplasty surgery, Audubon bird illustrations, and flea market paintings over a Hudson Super Market Antiques chest of drawers. He tucked a simple console behind the bed to create a useful shelf. The neutral walls are Benjamin Moore Wolf Gray 2127-40. \nIt's All About Bringing the Outdoors Inside \n\"We made the lamp,\" admits Rolston. \"The birch branch is from the property. One moonlit night in the fall at about 4am I was up reading with insomnia and a brown bear the size of a Great Dane walked right by our bedroom door with just the screen door between us and him. It's the only time I’ve ever thought, oh shit.\" \nMake The Outside as Well-Designed as Your Interiors \nRolston spends all summer outdoors, but notes that even when technically indoors, you feel like you're outdoors because the house is really one giant screened-in porch. The siding is Cabot semi-solid black stained pine 12” boards with the rough side out and Rolston designed this chair.
