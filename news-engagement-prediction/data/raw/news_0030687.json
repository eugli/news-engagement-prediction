(Photo: Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nA new all-sports radio station has muscled its way into the Valley’s already crowded sports airwaves. \nThe Fanatic on 1580 AM launches Monday and will feature some familiar local and national names including Jim Rome, who represents the station’s CBS Sports affiliation. \nThe mornings will begin with Valley sports radio veterans Kevin Ray and Mike Bauer at 6 a.m., followed by longtime ABC 15 sports anchor Craig Fouhy from 9-10 a.m. \nRome anchors the next two hours and precedes Jeffry O’Brien, a broadcaster/comedian who will host “The Daily Blender.” \nAnother familiar Valley voice, Jeff Dean, goes for an hour at 2 p.m., followed by Mike Muraco, Dan Manucci and Shawn Crespin (formerly on NBC Sports Radio 1060-AM) from 3 to 6 p.m. \nThe station also will include content from SB Nation Radio and feature live game broadcasts. \nShows will simulcast on FM channels 99.1 and 99.3. Broadcast bit \nThe Diamondbacks and Arizona Sports 98.7 have agreed to a five-year extension that will keep the team on the station through 2022. \nGreg Schulte will return for his 20th season as play-by-play voice and will be partnered against with analyst Tom Candiotti. Tom Ferrin is back to handling pregame and postgame show duties as well as secondary play-by-play responsibilities. \nMORE: Wildcats a 3 seed in NCAA's first in-season top 16 seeds Hoops there it is \nThe local Final Four organizing committee has a cool opportunity for those willing to donate a little time. \nIt is closer to reaching its goal of 3,600 volunteers but still need more to help with community and ancillary events before and during the Final Four, scheduled for April 1 and 3. Assistance is needed with hospitality, operations, information centers, transportation and other areas. \nVolunteers must be at least 18 by March 1 and able to work a minimum of three shifts from three to five hours each. \nThey'll score swag, including an official 2017 NCAA men’s Final Four polo shirt, hat and drawstring bag, a ticket to Fan Fest and an invitation to the post-Final Four Volunteer Appreciation Party. \nGo to www.phoenixfinalfour.com/volunteer to register and find more information. \n– Grand Canyon will host the State Farm College Slam Dunk and 3-Point Championships on March 29 and 30. The events are held annually in conjunction with the Final Four. \nThe competition, which in the past has featured a variety of standouts such as Bobby Hurley, Steve Nash and Jason Terry, will bring together 24 of the nation’s top men’s and women’s college basketball players. Other events include the Match Hot Shot Team Competition and the Shoe Carnival Battle of the Champions. Participants names will be released at a later date. \nTickets are $15 for adults and $10 for children and can be purchased at CollegeSlam.com. \nBICKLEY: Valley sports are entering a tenuous time following Final Four \n– I wasn’t sure how I would feel about the NCAA selection committee releasing its top 16 teams to date but I enjoyed Saturday’s CBS show. \nVillanova, Kansas, Baylor and Gonzaga were the top four seeds. Arizona was a ninth overall seed, and No. 3 in the Midwest. Oregon was a No. 8 overall. \nThe upcoming Pac-12 Tournament in Las Vegas should be meaningful. \nThe show was a good way to build excitement for the stretch run. I disagree with those who want more transparency – showing the current whole field and bubble teams, for example – because I like the element of surprise the real selection show delivers. \n- Wednesday was a rough night for college basketball fans in Arizona, especially those who had school the next day. Both Arizona and Arizona State tipped off at 9 p.m. \nNot a fan. \nRELATED: Phoenix Final Four coverage Quote of the day \n“(The reports of a $1.5 million payout to member schools are) in the ballpark. We were hoping for $5 million to $6 million when we were launching. There was never a guarantee, but we were optimistic because we owned it outright.” – Washington State athletic director Bill Moos to the San Francisco Chronicle on the unmet expectations of revenue from Pac-12 Networks. Stat of the day \n$3 million \nThe amount estimated that a deal with DirecTV could bring each Pac-12 school per year. \nReach Paola Boivin at paola.boivin@arizonarepublic.com and on Twitter at Twitter.com/PaolaBoivin.
