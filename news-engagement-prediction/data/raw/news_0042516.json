SWNS:South West News Service 3 Noah’s mum said the day before he died her son was “really happy doing everything he usually does, playing and laughing and being mischievous” \nThe 18-year-old had taken her kids to the park that day, but to her horror when she went to wake her son up Noah the following morning she found him lifeless in bed on February 4. \nMiss Lynn, of west Hull, said: “The day before he was really happy doing everything he usually does, playing and laughing and being mischievous. \n“I had put him to bed and in the morning he usually wakes up really early. I woke up at 9.30am which was late and I just thought he must have gone back to sleep for a bit.

I just thought he had fallen back to sleep so I said, ‘Come on little ‘un, lets get up.’ Then I saw him. \n“My partner picked him up and unravelled the quilt and saw him.” \nNoah was then pronounced dead by paramedics who arrived at the house after being alerted by Miss Lynn. \nThe mum says she went into total shock following his death. SWNS:South West News Service Noah was then pronounced dead by paramedics who arrived at the house after being alerted by his mum \n“I can’t even remember what happened after,” she said. \n“It’s the worst thing that’s ever going to happen to me. I never expected something like that to happen to us. \n“Why has this happened to Noah? He has been taken for no reason. He would have had a right bright future ahead of him as well. He was gorgeous. \n“He definitely took a big piece of my heart with him.” \nMiss Lynn is yet to return home since Noah’s death and is staying with her mother, Louisa Millington. \nThe grieving mum said the day before his death had just been a normal day for her young family. \nShe said: “He was really bubbly, really happy. He was just being himself. \n“The day before I took them both to the park and I spent lots of time there. He was going down the slides and going on the swings. He was so happy. \n“When I got home he just had his bath and some tea and went to bed. We had spent the full day together and he was just normal and happy. SWNS:South West News Service 3 After a day playing at the park, Noah was “really bubbly, really happy” before being found dead the next day \n“I can’t get my head around it still. I think it will hit me at the funeral. I am always thinking of him and I’m still able to see him every day before the funeral, so in a way he is still here. But it has been so hard. \n“I have tried to be really strong. It is worst at night when you are laid in bed because that’s when you sit and think. I’m used to having two little kids exhausting me every day, but now I just have one.” \nNoah’s death is not being treated as suspicious, and an inquest into his death will take place later this year. \nHis funeral will take place on February 24. \nMiss Lynn’s mother Louisa said it has been an incredibly hard time for the whole family. \nShe said: “I’m watching my daughter absolutely heartbroken and shattered into pieces,” said Ms Millington. \n“My heart is broken because I have lost my grandson and I’m watching my daughter grieving. I’m trying to keep her together so that she does not have to worry about anything else. \n“But it has been so hard. I just broke down and burst into tears yesterday because of it all. I ought to be strong for her and Noah should still be here, and we don’t know why he has been taken.” \nWe pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?
