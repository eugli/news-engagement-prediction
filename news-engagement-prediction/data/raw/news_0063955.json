The KWID RXL 1.0 L AMT variant will start at an introductory price of Rs 3.84 Lakh (ex showroom, New Delhi) and Rs 4.14 lakh (ex showroom, New Delhi) for the 1.0 L MT variant. \nEngine: \nThe 1.0 litre Renault Kwid SCe engine is optimally designed for better performance. The 4 valves per cylinder of the Double Over Head Camshaft (DOHC) layout ensures low pressure drop and super-efficient valve lift for a higher air filling; thus allowing the engine to make usable power at low end, mid-range and high-end rev bands. This high technology engine offers excellent drivability, be it slick city streets or on the highway. \nRenault Kwid 1.0L SCe will also feature new Speed -Sport designer graphics on the doors, and two-tone gloss grey ORVMs, enhancing its style quotient. \nTransmission: \nThe Easy-R Gear Box is a 5-speed Automated Manual Transmission (AMT) technology derived from Renault's rich and successful expertise in Formula 1. It enables a clutch free driving experience that combines the fuel economy and performance of a manual transmission with the convenience of automated gear shifting. \nSafety Features: \nApart from several active and passive safety equipment, Renault KWID already comes with the option of the driver airbag. Additionally, KWID offers first-in-class pro-sense seat belt pre-tensioners with load limiters, an important safety feature that is usually offered in upper segment cars. \nALSO READ: Renault Kaptur SUV coming to India this year For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
