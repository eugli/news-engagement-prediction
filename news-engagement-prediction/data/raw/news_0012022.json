(File, Volksblad) Northern Cape executive announced \nKimberley - Northern Cape Premier Sylvia Lucas will appear in the Equality Court in Upington next week to defend herself against accusations that she used the word \"hotnot\". \n“This case is about the dignity of our people. She must apologise to the community unreservedly on all media platforms and demonstrate remorse,” Stanley Peterson, a member of the National Khoi and San People, told News24. \nLucas is accused of saying “Hotnots are only good for clothes and food” in her introduction of John Block , provincial chairperson of the African National Congress in the Northern Cape, during a Budget statement at the Eiland Holiday Resort on September 18, 2010. The speech was broadcast on five community radio stations. \nPeterson, a former ANC member, took her to the Human Rights Council. Both parties appeared before Advocate Lawrence Mushawne, national chairperson of the HRC in November 2011 during mediation. Lucas was advised to apologise, but no apology materialised. \n“This left me with no choice other than to approach the court, because nobody is above the law,” said Peterson. \nHe told News24 that Lucas is willing to apologise to him, but that he believes her apology should be to the entire Khoi and San community. \n“You can’t use words like that in these times, particularly not if you are the premier. She should set the example.” Read more on: kimberley | racism Join the conversation! \n24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 .
