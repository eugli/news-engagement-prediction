They have a hard time but Rick succeeds to have their support fighting the Saviors, provide they give weapons and supplies to them. Meanwhile Richard discloses to Daryl his plan to force King Ezekiel to team up with the Alexandrians and the Hilltop to fight the Saviors, But Daryl does not agree. Then he meets Carol at her house.After \"Rock in the Road\", \"New Best Friends\" is a deceptive episode of \"The Walking Dead\". This weird new gang led by Jadis seems to be dangerous without having weapons. But Rick seems to be interested in associate with them and they might be a serious problem in the future. Carol has become an inconsistent character and it is hard to understand why people from The Kingdom are so concerned to help her. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): \"New Best Friends\" 7 of 17 people found this review helpful. Was this review helpful to you?
