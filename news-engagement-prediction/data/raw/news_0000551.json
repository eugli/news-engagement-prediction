There were also increased patrols in the area.\nThe complainant said she was attacked as she walked along Chapel Street close to the Horseshoe pub on the late afternoon of November 22 last year and an e-fit of the suspect was released.\nOn Friday, Greater Manchester Police said the inquiry had concluded after the girl told officers the original report was not genuine.\nThe arrested teenager, who had been bailed pending further inquiries, has been released without charge.\nBut police said a prosecution of the girl will not follow because of \"vulnerabilities identified\".\nChief Inspector John-Paul Ruffle said:\nWe take all reports of sexual offences extremely seriously and the welfare of the victim is our priority.\nAs soon as a report is made, the victim is supported by specially trained officers and we trust that each report is genuine.\nWe have carried out extensive inquiries and there were increased patrols in the area to reassure members of the community and encourage people who were understandably concerned to approach us.\nAs part of the investigation, we have concluded that it is not appropriate for us to pursue a prosecution in this instance due to a number of vulnerabilities that have been identified.\nThe girl is now being fully supported by specially trained officers and partner agencies.\nHelp and support is always there for people who report sexual offences. If you want to make a report of a sexual offence, you will be taken seriously.\nâ€“ Chief Inspector John-Paul Ruffle Manchester", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:41:37.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
