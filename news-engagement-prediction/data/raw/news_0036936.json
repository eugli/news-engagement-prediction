It seemed corny,” Masterson said. Daniel Petty, The Denver Post Adams State’s Lucio Ramirez (18) and Brian Glassey (13) toss belongings away of the start of the NCAA Division II South Central Regional Cross Country Championships at Washington Park on Nov. 5, 2016, in Denver. \nBut they eventually adopted it. It was an opportunity to remind themselves that even though running is an individual pursuit, it takes a team of five men — and sometimes more — to win in cross country. They carved out time for the occasion before their usual Sunday long runs. Sometimes, a teammate would mention the hard work of a younger runner, far down on the depth chart. Sometimes, a runner acknowledged someone who had made significant improvements. Sometimes it was a runner dealing with a nagging injury. \n“There were guys getting choked up. It was really motivating,” Masterson said. “It would be like, ‘I see you busting your tail every day even though you’re injured.’ It meant a lot to people.” \nMasterson knows the feeling. \nHe was a part of the 2013 team that won a national title but he struggled with knee injuries that required two major surgeries. From late 2013 to the middle of 2015, he was sidelined. \n“There was a long period when I thought I would never run competitively again,” Masterson said. \nAs for the nationals, long-time coach Damon Martin had a plan. \n“I made sure with this young team that I wasn’t going to allow them to peak too early,” Martin said. “We did try to win the other (conference and regional meets), but it wasn’t going to come at the expense of letting up too early.” \nThe men spent hours running on treadmills in full sweats. He upped the number of hill repeats they did in Alamosa’s thin 6,500 feet of elevation. Even as they lost the conference meet and then fell on a tiebreaker in the regional, they felt prepared coming into championship week. Daniel Petty, The Denver Post Sydney Gidabuday of Adams State leads Nathanael Williams (121) of the Colorado School of Mines and Dan Mahoney (116) of the Colorado School of Mines during the NCAA Division II South Central Regional Cross Country Championships at Washington Park on Nov. 5, 2016, in Denver. \n“By the time the week of nationals came, I felt pretty confident we had it,” said Sydney Gidabuday, a sophomore from California and the team’s top runner. “My last 2K was a pretty rough one. I was hearing teammates cheer and Grand Valley was so close. I had looked behind me, and this guy was coming fast. I kept telling myself to hold strong until the finish.” \nHe did, enough for the team’s seventh Division II title in the past nine seasons. \nAdams State topped Grand Valley State 54-79 (the low score in cross country wins), driven largely by the finishes of their third, fourth and fifth runners: Lucio Ramirez, Kale Adams and Chandler Reid. \nWinning the so-called “Triple Crown” of cross country, indoor track and outdoor track has never been done. The Grizzlies are already under way with their indoor season and will compete in indoor nationals in early March. In outdoors, they’ll return to Florida in late May. \nThey hope the foundation they started building as a team, starting last summer with the nascent idea of a puzzle board, can carry them through the rest of this year. \n“Week after week, I was amazed and then how that (puzzle) impacted them,” Martin said. “At the end of the year, every one had gotten a piece. When they put the together, it was a national championship trophy.” Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:11:33.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
