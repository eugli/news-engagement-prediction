They do reduce the level of pain, but only very slightly, and arguably not of any clinical significance. \n“When you factor in the side effects which are very common, it becomes clear that these drugs are not the answer to providing pain relief to the many millions who suffer from this debilitating condition every year.” GETTY An estimated sixth of the UK population suffers from back pain at any one time \nPhysiotherapists welcomed the study’s findings, pointing out that exercise can often be the key to tackling the problem. Tim Hutchful, of the British Chiropractic Association, said: “I would agree with the research that prevention is always better than cure when it comes to back pain. \n“Modern lifestyles are putting increasing amounts of strain on our backs and necks, so it’s important that people incorporate simple steps into their daily routine to maintain a healthy posture and take proactive measures to protect their back health before it starts to affect their daily lives. For example, people are often surprised at the positive impact that simply ensuring you take regular breaks when sitting for long periods of time, or walking regularly, can have on your back. \n“The British Chiropractic Association has developed Straighten Up UK, a series of simple daily exercises designed to help people improve their posture and prevent back pain by promoting balance, strength and flexibility in the spine.” \nThe study, which examined 35 trials involving more than 6,000 people, also found patients taking anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen were 2.5 times more likely to suffer gastrointestinal problems such as stomach ulcers and bleeding.
