Key points: 360 imagery provides snapshot into how coral reefs are recovering after damage Google partnered with The Ocean Agency to allow the public to explore the photos Using a 360 camera and GPS means individual locations can be pinpointed \nAfter one frustrating meeting too many selling the benefits of three-ply toilet paper, advertising man Richard Vevers decided to upend his career and follow his passion for underwater photography. \nNow he is behind the pioneering design of the innovative camera that is being used to record the world's coral reef habitats in captivating detail. \nMr Vevers, who campaigns to save the world's coral reefs from extinction, said his motivation for the project was an unshakeable belief that many people do not engage with ocean issues simply because they have not experienced the underwater world first-hand. \n\"Something like 99 per cent of people have never been diving and probably never will,\" he said. \n\"So it becomes really important to reveal marine environments because there are lots of issues going on underwater that are simply out of sight and out of mind.\" \nDrawing on his marketing background, Mr Vevers co-founded not-for-profit organisation The Ocean Agency and secured money from one of the world's largest insurers to map the equivalent of Google Street View underwater. \nBut his sponsors wanted a marine science component as well and that is where Professor Ove Hoegh-Guldberg from the University of Queensland's Global Change Institute became involved. \n\"I didn't know at the time that he was escaping from marketing toilet tissue. He Googled marine biology in Australia and my name came up,\" Professor Hoegh-Guldberg said. \nThe idea was ambitious. \n\"I basically said to Ove, what could a scientist do with a million images underwater?'\" Mr Vevers said. \n\"And his eyes lit up and he thought, 'whoa, this could really transform coral reef monitoring on a global scale'.\" Photo: Mr Vevers (second from right) with the survey team. (Supplied: The Ocean Agency/XL Catlin Sea Survey) \nProfessor Hoegh-Guldberg's team developed a science program as part of the project. Together the team went on to record hundreds of thousands of images in the coastal waters of 22 countries, beginning in 2012, to measure the health of the world's coral reefs. \nMr Vevers described the marriage of science and cutting-edge imagery as a \"game-changer\". \n\"This is what I get out of bed for in the morning,\" Professor Hoegh-Guldberg said. \n\"I personally love these left-of-field solutions, where a marketer meets a scientist and an insurance company comes out and sponsors them, all these people come together and suddenly out of that you have something very different.\" \nDesigning a camera to film multiple images that could then be stitched together to create a 360 degree view presented multiple challenges for Mr Vevers and his team. \n\"No-one had tried to take 360 imagery underwater while motoring along an underwater environment,\" he said. \n\"We mount the camera on a military-grade scooter but we need to be able to change exposures as we go, so we had an underwater tablet and an underwater mouse that then controls the cameras. It's a really sophisticated piece of equipment.\" External Link: Coral bleaching is a highly visual direct impact of the ocean absorbing 93 per cent of climate change heat, The Ocean Agency says. \nAs the divers track underwater reef contours, more than 1,000 consecutive shots can be recorded. Each image is located via a GPS buoy towed by the divers \nGoogle partnered with The Ocean Agency for the project to allow the public to explore the photos taken by the team on the Google Oceans page. \n\"What it means is that we can go back to that exact same location years down the track or after a major event like a big cyclone or bleaching event and we can see what's happened to the reef and look at it at scale,\" Mr Vevers said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:53:17.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
