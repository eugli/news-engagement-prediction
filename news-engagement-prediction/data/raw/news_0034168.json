I can't put into words how happy I am.\nWords can't express how I feel, I just want to say thank you to everyone who helped me.\n– Aldren Tomlinson A Sodexo spokesman added:\nWe received an appeal, reviewed the situation and offered the employee reinstatement, which he has accepted.\nWe look forward to seeing him back at work on Monday.\n– Sodexo Last updated Fri 17 Feb 2017 Health London", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:48:14.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
