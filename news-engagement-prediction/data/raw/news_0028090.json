The charging documents also allege a second child was abused in 2013.\nAccording to CBS Pittsburgh , Sandusky had been dating the mother of one of the alleged victims for five years and lived with her. Court documents assert that Sandusky instructed the child not to tell anyone, and told the child that his requests “were not weird because he studied medicine.” The child also alleged that Sandusky requested oral sex from him.\nA preliminary hearing was scheduled for February 22 and Sandusky is currently being held on $200,000 bail at Centre County Prison outside Pennsylvania.\nSandusky’s father, Jerry, was convicted in 2012 on 45 total counts of sexually abusing 10 different young boys after a child abuse sex scandal at Penn State University. An investigation conducted by former FBI director Louis Freeh alleged that Sandusky’s colleagues frequently covered up his abuse and showed a “total and consistent” disregard for the victims. The Freeh report was itself the subject of intense criticism by fans and boosters of Penn State, and the family of legendary former Penn State head football coach Joe Paterno. According to CNN , Jeffrey Sandusky made comments in 2014 insisting his father was innocent. After his mother did an interview maintaining her husband’s innocence, Jeffrey agreed.\n“Hopefully the interview puts out our side, or some of the things we feel. Knowing my father is innocent, and some of the things that were brought up, hopefully they’re taken and actually people will listen to [it] and take it to heart,” he said at the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:57:27.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
