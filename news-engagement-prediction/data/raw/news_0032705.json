Alamy 2 The mobile phone firm confirmed that the popular £1 lunch perk would be ending next week \nBut the mobile provider said it would be ending on February 20 so that it could “explore and introduce” new deals. \nCustomers will still be able to redeem the £1 lunch offer from other retailers, including WHSmith, Upper Crust, Pumpkin and Ritazza. \nThe change, which was spotted by members of HotUkDeals , has already upset some customers who use the Priority Moments scheme. \nOne user said it was the “end of an era”, while another added: “Tis a dark dark day”. \nSome customers have already started asking the mobile phone firm to change its mind. Cannot believe £1 boots meal deal is ending next week @BootsUK @O2PriorityUK @O2 \n— gemma martin (@gemmartin_tmb) February 13, 2017 It's a shame the O2 Priority Boots £1 meal deal stops after next Monday. That was my favourite part of the O2 Priority app \n— George Cairns (@georgethefourth) February 13, 2017 @O2 Please can you reconsider the decision to end Boots £1 meal deal next week on Priority?

News Group Newspapers Ltd 2 The 02 deal gets you a sandwich, snack and a drink for a quid \nThe supermarket cut premium range items from its money-saving offer, including the Taste The Difference sandwiches and foot-long subs. BBC investigation finds 'two thirds of Tesco customers overcharged by expired deals' \nA spokesperson from 02 said: “We constantly review all the deals available on Priority which gives our customers access to some great offers that help them to save money. \n“Customers can still enjoy access to other £1 lunch offers on Mondays by checking out the latest deals through the Priority app (subject to availability).” \nWe pay for your stories!
