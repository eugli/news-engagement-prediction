His 2018 club option is worth $7MM and comes with a $1MM buyout. \n2:31pm: It’s a one-year deal with a club option, per Paul Hoynes of the Plain Dealer ( via Twitter ). \n1:55pm: The Indians have agreed to a deal with free-agent lefty Boone Logan , per Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports ( via Twitter ). Terms remain unknown at this time; the deal is pending the results of a physical. \nLogan, 32, has reportedly sought a two-year deal, with indications he’d be able to command that. Before the offseason, MLBTR predicted a two-year, $12MM contract for the veteran. He just wrapped up a three-year, $16.5MM pact with the Rockies that didn’t really pan out for the team, though Logan certainly ended his tenure in Colorado on a strong note. \nIn 2016, Logan worked to a 3.69 ERA — all the more impressive that he did so while pitching at Coors Field — with 11.1 K/9 and 3.9 BB/9 over 46 1/3 innings. With a 93 mph fastball and a devastating slider, he racked up an outstanding 16.4% swinging-strike rate that rates among the game’s best. He typically produces solid groundball rates, too, with a lifetime 46.4% mark. \nOf course, Logan wasn’t nearly as good over the two prior seasons, over which he carried a 5.37 ERA — due, at least in part, to elevate BABIP totals (.379 in 2014 and .374 in 2015). He has also dealt with elbow issues at times, which presents not-unfamiliar risk. \nThe bigger issue, though, may be in his usage limitations. While he’s dominant against opposing southpaws, Logan isn’t nearly as effective against righties. Over 847 total plate appearances during his career, righty hitters own a .288/.376/.478 slash. \n[RELATED: Updated Indians Depth Chart ] \nFor the Indians, though, Logan still offers plenty of functionality. The club already has the dominant Andrew Miller available as the southpaw piece of a high-leverage mix that includes righties Cody Allen and Bryan Shaw. With those three arms already in place, skipper Terry Francona ought to have plenty of flexibility in deploying Logan to take full advantage of his skillset. \nPhoto courtesy of USA Today Sports Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:03:29.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
