In 1953, the Hall of Famer helped Hamilton win the Grey Cup game. (Source: cfl.ca) Related Stories \nBernie Custis, pro football's first black quarterback who blazed the trail for future stars like Warren Moon, Chuck Ealey and Damon Allen, has died. \nHe was 88. \nCustis made pro football history Aug. 29, 1951, when he became a starter with the CFL's Hamilton Tiger-Cats, who confirmed his death Thursday. \nCFL commissioner Jeffrey Orridge issued the following statement: \n\"Trailblazers are rightly remembered for being the first. Bernie Custis, the first black professional quarterback in the modern era starting with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats in 1951, should be revered as well for being one of our best. A world class athlete, he excelled both as a quarterback and a running back. A tremendous leader, he was a successful coach who had a positive impact on countless young lives. A true gentleman, he brought honour to our game and our league, and provided us with a role model to emulate. \n\"In 2015, I had the privilege of presenting the CFL's Commissioner's Award to Mr. Custis to thank him on behalf of our league and our fans. Our thoughts and prayers are with all who loved Bernie. He changed the game by blazing a trail. He also showed us all how to travel the trail with grace and character.\" \nCustis starred at quarterback with Syracuse University and was selected sixth overall by the Cleveland Browns in the 1951 NFL draft. \nBut the former college roommate of Al Davis, the late Oakland Raiders coach and owner, was told he'd play safety with the club, a move he resisted. \nThe native of Washington, D.C., opted to sign with Hamilton instead, starting every game under centre in his first season in the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union, one of the leagues that would later form the CFL. \nCustis moved to running back the following season and in 1953 helped Hamilton win the Grey Cup game, downing Winnipeg 12-6. 5-time Grey Cup champion \nCustis finished his pro career with the Ottawa Rough Riders, playing running back in 1955-56. \nAfter a brilliant career at Washington, Moon was undrafted by the NFL and headed to Edmonton for the chance to play quarterback professionally. After leading the Eskimos to five straight Grey Cup titles (1979-83), he went on to star for several teams in the NFL. He is a member of both the Canadian Football and Pro Football Hall of Fame. \nDespite leading Toledo on a 35-game win streak in his three years as the starter, Ealey was bypassed by NFL teams and headed to Hamilton to play professionally in 1972. He became the Ticats' starter later that year and was named the league's top rookie. \nEaley capped his memorable first CFL season leading Hamilton to a 13-10 Grey Cup win over Saskatchewan at Ivor Wynne Stadium. He went on to play for Winnipeg and Toronto in the CFL before retiring after the '78 season. \nAllen came to the CFL following his collegiate career at Cal State Fullerton, joining the Eskimos in 1985. Allen played for six teams over an illustrious 23-year career, winning four Grey Cups. \nWhen he retired after the '07 season Allen was the leading passer in pro football history (72,381 yards). He's currently second overall behind former Montreal star Anthony Calvillo (79,816). \nAfter football, Custis returned to Hamilton, enjoying a long career as a teacher and school principal. He also got involved in coaching at various levels over 31 years. Top Canadian university coach \nHe compiled a 74-20 record over eight seasons with the Burlington Braves of the Canadian Junior Football League, including three Ontario championships and two Eastern Canadian titles. It was there Custis coached tight end Tony Gabriel, who'd later star in the CFL with Hamilton and Ottawa before being inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame. \n\"RIP Bernie Custis, my Burlington Braves coach & the one responsible for my getting a scholarship at Syracuse. A great friend and a mentor,\" Gabriel said on his Twitter account. \nCustis led the Sheridan College Bruins to six OCAA and Eastern Canadian titles (1973-78) and spent eight seasons as the McMaster Marauders coach. He registered a 31-23-1 record and was named Canadian university football's top coach in 1982. \nCustis was inducted into the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1994 and in 2015 received the CFL's commissioner's award from Jeffrey Orridge. \n\"Bernie Custis changed the face of our game forever,\" Orridge said at the time. \"Before Henry Burris and Damon Allen and Warren Moon and Chuck Ealey, there was Bernie Custis. \n\"Many of us here tonight would not have had the opportunities we've had, were it not for people like Bernie Custis.\" \nCustis is also a member of the McMaster University Hall of Fame and Syracuse University Athletic Hall of Fame.
