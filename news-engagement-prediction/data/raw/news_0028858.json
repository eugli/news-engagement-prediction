There was no story development or true plot. It was like watching someone play a video game. If you like doing that, you'll like the movie. If not, you will hate this. I do not. (With conditions) You Must See This Film by Hawkins2293 It is an interesting trend over the years that movies have tried more and more to be 'deep' or try to offer ground-breaking perspectives, which I freely admit in some/many cases results in an enjoyable, engaging plot and therefor film. In many (in my opinion most) cases, though, this results in these films becoming excessively introspective or complex for a simple entertainment.Hardcore Henry doesn't try with any of that, and has just enough plot to explain where the perspective is going. You the viewer know as much as Henry does, as he learns it, and no excess baggage. Quite frankly, I think this (meaning the POV perspective) could actually work very well for a mystery film for that very reason, but I'm getting off topic. This results in a film that knows full well what it is (a shameless adrenaline rush/REALLY gallows comedy) and does that exceptionally well.The reason for the conditions is that, with the POV perspective, there is a great deal of running, jumping, exploding, and (not spoiler because trailers exist) dead people, which I know and fully understand many people simply find themselves unable to handle. Aside from that, though, this is easily one of my favorite films of all time, because it knows what it is, it tells you what it is, and then delivers exactly what it has promised.Interesting aside, this is only the (I believe) second review I have ever written on iTunes in more than a decade of participation, so that alone should tell you how I feel about this film. Watch it. offically my #1 movie of all time went to see it on the premier night with high hopse,and i was not disapointed, the execution of it was flawless, Viewers Also Bought", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T13:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T09:23:38.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
