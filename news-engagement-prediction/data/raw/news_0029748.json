Welfare cuts mean two-thirds of women’s refuges will close, charity warns \nThe acclaimed British director spoke during the 2017 BAFTA Awards as he accepted his award for Best British Film for I, Daniel Blake, a movie about a middle-aged carpenter who suddenly finds himself needing help from state after injuring himself but soon gets caught up in the red tape and bureaucracy of a system that does not work. \nAs he accepted his award, Loach thanked his cast and crew, and the people of Newcastle, where they shot the film, and the Academy for ‘endorsing the truth of that this film says, which is that hundreds of thousands of people in this country know, the vulnerable and the poorest people are treated by the this government with a callousness and brutality that is disgraceful’. \nHe also referenced the government’s latest decision to renege on their promise to accept thousands of unaccompanied refugee children, calling it a ‘disgrace’. \n‘In the real world,’ he said to cheers from the audience, ‘it’s getting darker’. \n‘And in the struggle that’s coming between the rich and the powerful, the corporations and the politicians that speak for them, and the rest of us on the other side, the film-makers know which side they’re on.’ \nLoach has been a long outspoken critic of the Tory government; in 2016 he won the Palme D’or for the film and said at the time that film makers ‘must give a message of hope, we must say another world is possible’. \n‘The world we live in is at a dangerous point right now. We are in the grip of a dangerous project of austerity driven by ideas that we call neo-liberalism that have brought us to near catastrophe,’ he said at the ceremony in May 2016 . \nLove this as much as we do?
