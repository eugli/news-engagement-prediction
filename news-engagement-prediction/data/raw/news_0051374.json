Post Your Comments Nisha Poddar (more) \nCorrespondent, CNBC-TV18 | In what could be confirmation of recent speculation, Kotak Mahindra Bank is learned to have approached the government seeking a merger with country's third largest private sector lender Axis Bank , sources have told CNBC-TV18.They add that the move has sparked an interest from other industry players, including HDFC Bank , HDFC , ICICI Bank and IndusInd , who have all approached the government informally expressing an interest in picking up stake in Axis.LIC, which has a 14.49 percent stake in Axis as of quarter ending December 2016, has also expressed interest in buying additional stake.Banks have told the government that should there a sale process be undertaken for Axis Bank, it should be a competitive one.Previously, Axis Bank has denied the merger talks with Kotak. On February 20, it informed the exchanges that the “news is baseless and unsubstantiated.”Other banks too refused to comment on market speculations.Through the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), the government has a 12.02 percent stake in Axis Bank as of the quarter ending December 31.If the centre plans to sell its entire stake of 12.02 percent in Axis Bank then it can raise around Rs 14,507 crore as per today's closing price and can very well overachieve its revised divestment target of Rs 45,500 crore for FY17.Back in 2014 the government sold 9 percent of its stake in Axis Bank for Rs 5,557.28 crore. Back then LIC emerged as the single largest investor by accumulating over 85 lakh shares for around Rs 1,116 crore.Post the CNBC-TV18 newsbreak, stock price of Axis Bank jumped around 5 percent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:05:52.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
