These three are fun, fast-talking and fabulously coiffed (thanks to costume designer Renee Ehrlich Kalfus). They’re also African American women, which perhaps explains why this nugget of history has remained untold until now. Sure, some of it feels a little obvious, but with its “based on a true story” title card, cartoon palette and bouncy Pharrell (co)-penned soundtrack, this splashy, feelgood period piece is every bit as enjoyable as a best picture Oscar-nominated blockbuster could hope to be.\nThe genius of Theodore Melfi’s film is not in the originality of the script – as far as prestige pictures go, its dramatic and comedic beats are easy to anticipate – but in the novelty of the story and the liveliness of the performances. Each leading lady gets her own arc, though we mostly stick with Katherine, a brilliant mathematician and mother of three with excellent cat-eye glasses, who must brush off everyday office racism in order to prove herself to her stern but otherwise tolerant boss Al Harrison (Kevin Costner). This is Henson’s film, though the supporting cast are uniformly excellent, in particular Moonlight’s Mahershala Ali as Katherine’s dashing love interest, a gentle, serious man impressed and only a little intimidated by her intelligence.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the trailer for Hidden Figures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:49:14.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
