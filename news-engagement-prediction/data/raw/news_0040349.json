Hasbro has confirmed on Thursday that the thimble—a token that was originally added to the game in 1935—didn’t receive enough votes to remain in the updated version of the game that will be sold later this year. The toy maker had launched a “Monopoly Token Madness” campaign that allowed fans to vote on a mix of the classic eight tokens and dozens of new alternatives. Hasbro said that with more than 4 million votes cast, the thimble didn’t make the cut. “The Thimble token will not “Pass GO” in the next generation of the Monopoly game,” Hasbro said. “The lucky Thimble has lost its ‘shine’ with today’s fans and will be retired from the game.” Hasbro hasn’t yet announced what token will replace it, as final results are due to be revealed in March. The current tokens that will remain are: Scottie Dog, Car, Battleship, Hat, Boot, Wheelbarrow and Cat. Cat is a relatively new addition, as Monopoly toyed with the lineup back in 2013 when it added cat to replace the classic iron token. Some of the new tokens that were up for consideration this year included a penguin, rubber duck, TV, watch, and an emoji of Mr. Monopoly. It makes sense that voters would opt to ditch the thimble, as that token represented a household object that was a part of day-to-day life in the 1930s when the current version of the board game was first published. But it isn’t as relevant to modern America—unlike other older tokens like the car or boot. Monopoly is a core property within Hasbro’s games division, which also includes classics like Sorry!, Operation, and Hungry Hungry Hippos and the more modern Pie Face. That business reported a 9% jump in revenue last year, to $1.39 billion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:45:15.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
