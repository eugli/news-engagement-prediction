PUBLISHED: 01:12, Tue, Feb 7, 2017 | UPDATED: 01:34, Tue, Feb 7, 2017 PA/GETTY Sturgeon's bid for more power over Brexit negotiations has been dealt a fresh blow \nThe SNP-led clause was defeated by 332 votes to 62 - a majority of 270. \nIn yet more bad news for Sturgeon and the SNP, The Scottish Government, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Irish Assembly will not be given an additional month to debate Theresa May’s Brexit plan before Article 50 is triggered. \nThe news comes as ministers comfortably saw off four opposition attempts to amend the Article 50 bill with the Prime Minister’s Brexit plans still on track.

PA SNP leader in Westminster Angus Robertson pictured in the Commons on Monday \nEarlier on Monday evening, the SNP’s Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh moved her party’s amendments because the Prime Minister’s introduction to the white paper on Brexit describes the UK as one nation, while Ms Ahmed-Sheikh believed it should be referred to as four nations. \nTory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg hit back immediately, asking if this clause would effectively give Sturgeon a veto on triggering Article 50.

GETTY Sturgeon and the PM met with other leaders of the devolved governments in Cardiff last week \nShadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman led calls for Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish leaders to be regularly consulted on the negotiations before any agreements are made with the EU. \nDespite the Supreme Court ruling that the Government did not require permission from the devolved nations before triggering Article 50, Ms Chapman still pushed for more control for the devolved nations over Brexit negotiations. \nShe said: \"Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales must be included and taken account of throughout the process by which the UK Government negotiates our terms of withdrawal from the European Union, and equally importantly the framework for our future relationship with the EU.\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:44:05.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
