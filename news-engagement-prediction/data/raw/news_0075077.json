Phones with very little border around their faces mean that their displays run up right to the edges. Functionally, though, a bezel-less phone doesn't necessarily add anything, though it can (and does) to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge , for example.

Unfortunately, it's only sold in China and it's quite expensive. But fingers cross it'll make its way to more countries soon.
