Some women had much better results.\nPalbociclib is licensed for women with breast cancer which is HER2 negative, oestrogen positive and has spread around the body.\nThe Nice appraisal looked specifically at patients who had not been given any other treatment for advanced or metastatic cancer, with around 5,500 such cases annually.\n\nFive cancer red flags to never ignore D r Nicholas Turner, from the Institute of Cancer Research, London, who was on the Nice panel said: \"Palbociclib is one of the most important advances in treating the most common type of breast cancer in 20 years.\n\"Clinical trials show the drug can substantially slow the progression of the disease and help delay chemotherapy, which often has life-limiting side-effects.\n\"It is very disappointing that palbociclib is not being made available to patients, but cost is the limiting factor.\n\"If the manufacturer, Nice and NHS England can find a way of making this treatment available for patients, they will substantially improve the lives of patients with breast cancer.\"\nProfessor Paul Workman, chief executive of the ICR, said: \"Rapid action is needed to ensure that exciting new treatments like palbociclib are priced at a level that allows them to be judged cost-effective.\n\"People with cancer must be able to benefit from the academic research that helps lead to effective new treatments like this, which extend survival and improve quality of life.\"\nCancer in the UK P rofessor Carole Longson, director of the centre for health technology assessment at Nice, said: \"The committee needs more evidence of the drug's impact on overall survival of people with breast cancer.\n\"However, even when allowing for these potential benefits, it was still not enough to make palbociclib cost effective at its current price.\"\nThe ruling is now open to public consultation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:08:12.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
