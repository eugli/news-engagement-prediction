You can vote as many times as you'd like in the top 64 until the poll closes on Friday, Feb. 10 at 5 p.m. PT. The 32 couples with the most votes will move onto the second round, which will be tournament-style, with each couple facing off against another couple until only one remains. \nThe 64 couples competing this year include everyone from last year's winner, The 100's Clarke and Lexa, to all your This Is Us faves, to one couple from the Norwegian show Skam , which received so many nominations it could certainly not be overlooked. Photos \nThe 50 Greatest TV Couples Ever \nUnfortunately, some ships had to stay in the harbor due to the fact that some shows have chosen the really slow burn route for even their most popular potential couples, but there's always next year! \nAgain, you have until this Friday at 5 p.m. PT to cast as many votes for as many couples as you'd like. Have fun, and be nice!
