Salman Khan as Raja and Prem in a still from Judwaa \nFree Press Journal reports that Khan will also join Varun in playing a double role in the sequel. He will play Prem and Raja 20 years down the lane. Both his avatars will be seen sharing the screen space with the two characters of Varun. \nNow, News 18 reports that producer Sajid Nadiadwala has confirmed that not only Khan, but his leading lady from the prequel, Karisma Kapoor will also make a cameo in Judwaa 2 . \nThis will be Kapoor's 11th film with David, her first being Raja Babu in 1994. Also, she will be seen gracing the silver screen after four years as her last cameo was in the star-studded title song of Bombay Talkies. Also, if she shares the screen space with Khan, it will be their ninth collaboration, the last one being David's 2000 comedy Chal Mere Bhai. \nAs far as the leading ladies of the sequel are concerned, Taapsee Pannu and Jacqueline Fernandez will be seen romancing the two avatars of Varun. While this will be his first collaboration with Pannu, Varun has shared the screen space with Fernandez in his brother Rohit Dhawan's action comedy from last year, Dishoom. \nThe highlight of Judwaa 2 , however, will remain Khan's twin cameo. This is the third time Nadiadwala has got him to play a double role on the screen after Judwaa and his directorial debut from 2014, Kick . Besides the two Nadiadwala films, Khan has also done a double role in Sooraj Barjataya's family drama from 2015, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo.
