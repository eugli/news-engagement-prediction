The court should decline.\"\nThey also lodged a statement by a host of national security officials - including former secretaries of state John Kerry and Madeleine Albright, and former CIA director Leon Panetta - which describes the travel ban as ineffective, dangerous and counterproductive.\nUS legal residents from the seven countries named in the ban have been facing uncertainty Lawyers for tech firms including Apple and Google have also lodged arguments with the court, saying that the travel ban would harm their companies by making it more difficult to recruit employees.\nPresident Trump has attacked the federal judge who originally blocked his travel ban and the judiciary in general, saying Americans should blame the courts \"if something happens\".\nMr Trump also said he had instructed border officials to check people entering America \"very carefully\".\nIn a series of tweets on Sunday, Mr Trump said: \"I have instructed Homeland Security to check people coming into our country VERY CAREFULLY. The courts are making the job very difficult!\"\n\"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\"\nUS border checks All persons arriving at a US port of entry are inspected by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers Visitors must have valid US visas or hold \"Green Cards\" that authorise them to live and work in the US permanently Travellers under the Visa Waiver Program must apply for authorisation via ESTA (the Electronic System for Travel Authorization) before their visit A CBP officer at Atlanta airport Visitors must complete declaration forms Travellers may have their fingerprints and photos taken CBP officers may also ask to inspect luggage or personal items CBP uses biometric technologies to verify travellers' identities Travellers from certain countries can use Automated Passport Control (APC) US federal judge James Robart's ruling on Friday suspends the implementation of elements of President Trump's executive order .\nWashington and Minnesota argue that the ban is unconstitutional because it denied people with valid entry documents the right to travel without legal recourse. It also violated freedom of religion rights by appearing to target Muslims, they said.\nThe ruling suspends:\nthe seven-country travel ban; the temporary refugee admissions ban; the reprioritisation of minority religion (interpreted to mean Christian) refugee claims; and the ban on Syrian refugees. The cap on overall US refugee admissions this year of 50,000 is not covered by the judge's ruling.\nIn its appeal , the justice department said Judge Robart had overreached by \"second-guessing\" the president on a national security matter.\nIt also argued that only the president could decide who can enter or stay in the US.\n\"The American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind\" - Vice-President Mike Pence Democrats and some Republicans have criticised Mr Trump's comments about the judiciary.\nDemocratic Senator Patrick Leahy, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Mr Trump seemed \"intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis\".\nMeanwhile, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell told CNN it was \"best to avoid criticising judges individually\".\nJudge Robart has served on the federal bench since 2004 after being nominated by President George W Bush.\n\"We are very excited, we are very happy\" - Iraqi national flies to the US with his family Friday's ruling has also seen visa holders from the affected nations scramble to get flights to the US, fearing they have a slim window to enter.\nThe state department has been reversing visa cancellations, and US homeland security employees have been told by their department to comply with the ruling.\nThe ban caused confusion at US and foreign airports when it came into force.\nPolls suggest that US public opinion is sharply divided on the travel ban.\n\"I have five things to say to you\": Immigrant rights campaigner Thanushka Yakupitiyage Have you had your travel to the US disrupted by the ban?
