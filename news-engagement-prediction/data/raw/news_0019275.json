Look No Further Once daily PrEP doesn't have to be confusing. 02/08/2017 12:43 pm ET JamesMichael Nichols Queer Voices Deputy Editor, The Huffington Post \nIf you’ve ever been interested in starting PrEP but have questions or feel confused, one New York City-based organization is here to help alleviate your anxiety. \nPre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP) is a once daily pill used as a preventative form of care when it comes to protecting high-risk individuals against contracting HIV. When taken daily, it can reduce the risk of contracting HIV in high-risk individuals by more that 90%. \nIn honor of National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness day, HIV/AIDS advocacy organization Harlem United released a series of videos that speak to people about PrEp in a comfortable, digestible manner. Part of Harlem United’s Swallow This campaign , the videos focus on some of the communities at the highest risk for HIV, including black and latino men who have sex with men (MSM) and individuals in couples where one partner is HIV-positive. \n“We will not end the AIDS epidemic unless we break through the barriers to wide-scale use of PrEP among communities of color,” Jacqui Kilmer, CEO of Harlem United, said in a press release. “Half of black gay and bisexual men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with HIV in their lifetime if current trends continue. Just as shocking, the rate of HIV infection among Black women is 20 times higher than the rate among White women. Despite these alarming trends, only one in ten PrEP users is African American. This is why Harlem United has worked closely with funders to make a $600,000 investment over the first two years of our Swallow This campaign.” \nCheck out another video from the new Harlem United campaign below and head here to learn more about the Swallow This campaign.
