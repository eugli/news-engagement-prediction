This prediction has already come true.\nInsubordination by 900 State Department Employees On February 1 st , 900 State Department employees, in an act of extreme insubordination, signed a document stating that they did not support the temporary Muslim ban on travel into the United States. The White House is aware of this action and this led White House Press Secretary to state that they were aware of the action and that these employees needed to decide if they were going to get on board or leave. Mr. Spicer, they need to leave. President Trump has a major problem on his hands.\nState Department Employee Facing Intimidation and Employment Termination Monika Wesolowski has been a State Department employee for over a decade. Her work has been exemplary. However, Monika has 4 distinct handicaps. She is White, Christian, conservative and cute. In today’s State Department this is a toxic and even potentially lethal combination. Most importantly, she supports Donald Trump and for that, she is experiencing extreme workplace harassment and today, she faces termination for displaying a President Trump’s photo at her workstation.\nSubsequently, Monika went to the ethics and legal department of the State Department and sought an opinion on displaying the photo of a sitting President in her workplace. The written opinion, see below, stated that what she was doing was not a violation and that she is not in violation of the Hatch Act which prohibits Federal employees from engaging in promoting a candidate. Monika subsequently showed the legal opinion to her supervisor, who promptly said “I don’t care, we will just have to agree to disagree”. Today, Monika faces an annual job review which has been moved up to coincide with these events. Monika stated that she expects to be fired today.\nWhat’s Good for the Goose Is Not Good for the Gander Please allow me to remind the readers that Kerry O’Grady, the head of the Denver Secret Service office, stated that she would not “take a bullet for Trump…the Hatch Act be damned”. This treasonous federal employee was allowed, by the Obama administration, to continue on the job with impunity for 3 months up until the time that Obama left office. There were absolutely no consequences for a clear Hatch Act violation under Obama.\nShortly after the national election, in Monika’s office, a State Department non-citizen contract employee from Saudi Arabia, began to circulate a petition which she encouraged people to sign. The purpose was to overthrow America’s election system, and support that Hillary Clinton should have been elected…. This is clear violation of the Hatch Act. Perceived pressure was put upon State Department employees to sign this petition. Monika’s supervisor apparently has no problem with her like-minded subordinates engaging in willful violations of Federal law.\nThe State Department: A Rogue Culture of Corruption and Racism In an interview on this topic which I did on Paul Preston’s Agenda 21 Radio show, he shared that he has outed 12 instances (people) associated with espionage in the State Department and that this ring was established under Clinton’s rule.\nMonika’s story is no less volatile. She produces State Department documents and brochures on sensitive topics. Monika has had work rejected for having too many White faces in the brochures. There are brochures, unrelated to topic, which do not permit any White faces to be used.\nThe Saudi Arabian contract employee is in charge of State Department brochures on Child Sex Trafficking. She does an amazing job, according to Monika, of producing documents about these events on the continent of Africa. However, none of these same type events are covered domestically. Let me remind the readers that Washington, D.C., is right next to Fairfax County, VA, and as such, is the highest child sex trafficking area in the country. The State Department is also a stone’s throw from the alleged location of PizzaGate. How is this topic not covered domestically? As a US citizen, I want this question answered. What is the State Department potentially covering up? How deep does this corruption go?\nDave Hodges’ Interview with Monika Wesolowski\nConclusion For President Trump to get a handle on these types of situations, there appears to be only one course of action. Because the spirits of Alger Hiss and the Bolsheviks are roaming the halls of the State Department, he needs to demand the resignation of every employee of the State Department, pending a performance review of each employee.\nWe do not need the swamp drained, we need the sewer rats cleared out. Make this go viral and send this to your Republican Congressmen and Senators.\nBy Dave Hodges |February 2nd, 2017| Conspiracy , Featured , Main | 0 Comments", "external_links": ["http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/2017/02/02/state-department-guilty-of-racism-harassment-treason-trump-supporting-employees-fear-for-their-lives/#respond", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/author/admindave/", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/pOJ4QMD1Vkw?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/category/main/", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2017/02/monika-legal-1024x497.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2015/12/CSS-Offical-New-Logo2.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/category/featured-2/", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/siteupload/2017/02/monika-pic.jpg", "http://www.thecommonsenseshow.com/category/conspiracy/"], "published": "2017-02-02T16:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:06:16.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
