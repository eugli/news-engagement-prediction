Never bet against Tom Brady.\" 02/06/2017 06:46 pm ET David Moye Reporter, The Huffington Post Brad Barket/Getty Images Tennis player Eugenie Bouchard, 22, was positive the Atlanta Falcons would win. \nIt’s a sure bet that tennis star Eugenie Bouchard won’t make any more Super Bowl wagers with Twitter followers. \nWhen the Atlanta Falcons were up by 21 points during the first half Sunday, the 22-year-old Canadian posted a tweet in support of the Dirty Birds. I knew Atlanta would win btw — Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \nOne of her Twitter followers, John Goerhke, wasn’t willing to follow her down that particular path and challenged her to a friendly Super Bowl bet. @geniebouchard if patriots win we go on a date? — Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \nBut Goehrke, a 20-year-old marketing major at the University of Missouri, had a feeling Tom Brady would find a way to come back. \n“I saw the tweet and I’m like, I wasn’t assuming the game was over because I knew how good the Patriots were and how good Tom Brady was, but I was like, I don’t think this is over,” Goehrke told The Chicago Tribune. “I thought it would be funny to comment something just to say whatever, like, ‘You’re crazy if you think this is over.’ ... But then I thought I could have more fun with it and do something else, so I thought of that.” \nBouchard’s reactions as the Patriots came back and she realized she might possibly be going on a date with a stranger were immortalized on her Twitter page. \nFirst she got embarrassed. — Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \nThen she freaked out. — Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \nThen she became pragmatic. — Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \nThen she became philosophical. — Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \nBouchard was still processing the loss on Monday morning. Omg...last night really happened... pic.twitter.com/WVxdKPYV68 — Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \nBut Bouchard is a woman of honor and said she would stand by the bet she made with Goehrke. Lol it made a Twitter moment. And I will do it, I stay true to my word 🙏🏼 pic.twitter.com/0rOUc0xJsC — Genie Bouchard (@geniebouchard) February 6, 2017 \nGoehrke is still waiting for Bouchard’s reps to contact him to set up a date. He’s also scoping out Chicago hot spots she might enjoy. \n“Honestly, if I’m even lucky enough for it to happen and I meet her, that would be good enough,” he told The Chicago Tribune. “Depending on where she wants to meet or what she wants to do, I’m going to try to take her to dinner. See what happens.” \nWhether it works out to be a love match for the tennis star remains to be seen. She has been linked to Jordan Caron, a hockey player in the Boston Bruins system, according to HockeyFeed.com.
