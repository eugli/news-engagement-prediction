As the symbol is considered sacred by the Hindu community, Sofia courted outrage over social media. She later took a stand for herself and wrote: “May those with anger know that they only do the work of the devil in their anger. May those that say unkind words know that those words come from negative entities whether you call it an energy, the devil or anything else.” A post shared by Sofia Hayat.
