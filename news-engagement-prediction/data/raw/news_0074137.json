Its active subscriber stood at 38 million (3.8 crore) at December end. Bharti Airtel, on the other hand, is the market leader with 26.1 per cent market share and a subscriber base of 258 million (25.8 crore). \n\n\"The acquisition of additional spectrum through this transaction, which made an attractive business proposition, has further enhanced our already solid spectrum portfolio,\" Vittal said.
