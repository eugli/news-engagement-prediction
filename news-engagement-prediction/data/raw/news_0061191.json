During their meeting, the bubbly young woman explained that she's a member of Helix (a supervillain group) and handed Felicity a jump drive containing stolen data from the NSA. Since then, Felicity has used the jump drive to exonerate Diggle, blackmail a Russian telecom executive, and quickly track down the villain(s) of the week. \nOf course, nothing comes for free, and Helix will ask Felicity for a favor. \nOLIVER SEEKS THE TRUTH — Oliver (Stephen Amell) gets closer to the truth about Prometheus. Meanwhile, Helix refuses to continue helping Felicity (Emily Bett Rickards) until she does a favor for them. \nKen Shane directed the episode written by Beth Schwartz & Sarah Tarkoff. \nBased on the characters from DC, ARROW is from Bonanza Productions Inc. in association with Berlanti Productions and Warner Bros. Television, with executive producers Greg Berlanti ( The Flash, Supergirl ), Marc Guggenheim ( Eli Stone, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters ), Andrew Kreisberg ( The Flash, Supergirl ), Wendy Mericle ( Desperate Housewives, Eli Stone ) and Sarah Schechter ( Supergirl, Blindspot ).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:48:43.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
