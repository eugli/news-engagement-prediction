Subramaniam told reporters. \nSouth Korea slammed the use of the toxin as a “blatant violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and other international norms”. \nNorth Korea, which has not signed the CWC, has already been hit with six sets of UN sanctions for carrying out nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches. - AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:17:50.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
