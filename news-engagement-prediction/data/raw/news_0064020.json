Directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, ‘Rangoon’ comes across an unusual love-triangle set in the backdrop of World War II. Related Gallery Shahid Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut and Saif Ali Khan in 'Rangoon' - Movie Stills \nThe trailer of the film turned out to be mighty impressive thereby adding a new leaf to Bhardwaj’s cap. The ace filmmaker has indeed surprised everyone by coming up with a film like ‘Rangoon’ that has three unusual names coming together for the first time! \nBesides directing the film which has a classic appeal, Bhardwaj has also composed the music which intentionally bears striking resemblance with the songs of the 1940s era. \n‘Rangoon’ is expected to have a great opening. Like many of the actors’ fans and ardent moviegoers, Ritika Handoo of Zeenews.com too has also made it to a theatre to watch first day first show to give you her verdict. \nCheck out her tweet review here: \n#Rangoon has an interesting star cast \n#Rangoon brings Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan and Kangana Ranaut together \nVishal Bhardwaj is a maverick filmmaker, let's see how #Rangoon fares! \n#Rangoon starts in a dramatic way \nKangana is Miss Julia in #Rangoon and she hits the right chord \nKangana Ranaut as Miss Julia is absolutely pleasing in #Rangoon \n#Rangoon has an artistic appeal and that makes it stand apart \nSaif Ali Khan and Shahid Kapoor too fit the bill in #Rangoon \nVishal Bhardwaj is a master of melody and #Rangoon has some great tracks \nKangana proves why she is the best when it comes to her craft #Rangoon \n#Rangoon is not your regular love story where girl meets boy and they fall in love \nSpecial mention must go to the director of photography in #Rangoon for bringing out the best in landscape \n#Rangoon is for people who understand and enjoy good cinema \nThe supporting cast in #Rangoon is equally a master stroke. Well done Vishal Bhardwaj!
