It doesn't seem like it because we've been hearing his name for so long. But he's 25. \n\"He hasn't even gotten to his potential, to his prime yet, so hopefully this group, this locker room, myself, my leadership [helps him]. Just want to see him grow every day, and it's a good place for him.\" \nWilliams will get a chance to play against the Timberwolves on Tuesday night when the Cavaliers head north to take on the Western Conference foe. It's safe to say Williams will have a little extra motivation in that game.
