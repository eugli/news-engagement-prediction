She had been in Iran on vacation for her sister's wedding and was set to return before Trump's Jan. 27 order\nAfter a federal judge blocked Trump's order, Saadati, 32, was able to fly back to Michigan last week. On Thursday, the 9th Circuit Court upheld the judge's ruling, which brought relief for many.\nBut still, Saadati and others like her with roots in the seven nations that Trump targeted are worried about the future. On Friday, Trump announced he's considering what he called a \"brand new order\" on immigration, reported the Associated Press. There's also concern another court could overturn the 9th Circuit decision, and how federal agents will carry out the court's decision and federal orders.\nRead more:\nAnxieties rise at Detroit haven for asylum seekers\nProtesters demonstrate outside federal ICE office in Detroit\nHundreds in metro Detroit protest on 'Day Without Immigrants'\n\"Of course, we're a little relieved,\" said Saadati's husband, Roozbeh Entezari, 41, of Pittsfield Township. \"But it's so frustrating to think, we can't go\" to Iran to visit family and come back to the U.S. with certainty.\n\"It doesn't feel safe,\" he said. \"It's a little bit confusing for all of us.\"\nEntezari said they're worried they will be separated from visiting family members in Iran, or their family members visiting them. Iran is one of the seven nations that Trump had targeted. Their mother-in-law had once stayed with them for several weeks and they were hoping to have her visit again, but they're now unsure whether that can happen.\n\"There's a battle going on\" among government branches, causing confusion, he said. \"We don't know how to deal with it.\"\nIt's also affecting travel for business purposes. Enterazi has a furniture cabinet business and had been planning to visit Iran for that, but said he now isn't going out of fear he won't be able to return, like Saadati was, temporarily.\nThe couple had immigrated from Iran to escape restrictions on their freedom and found a new life in America. When Saadati was initially barred from re-entry, they feared falling behind on their mortgage, car payments, and losing her photography business.\n\"To be honest, it's so scary they came up with this idea\" of the executive order, he said.\nOther immigrants and refugees have been allowed in since the federal judge's ruling. in addition to barring visitors from seven nations, Trump's order had stopped all refugees from entering.\nOn Tuesday night, Sahira Jazrawi, 72, and Suad Jazrawi, 73, arrived at Detroit Metro Airport from Jordan, where they had lived for several years after fleeing their native Iraq.\nThe refugees were due to arrive in the U.S. on Feb. 1, having donated all of their furniture in Jordan as they prepared for their new lives in the U.S. But Trump's order temporarily halted that, causing worry and uncertainty. After the ruling by the federal judge in Seattle, they arrived Tuesday, greeted by family, including their brother Sabah Estephan, 68, of West Bloomfield, himself a refugee from Iraq who came to the U.S. in 2007.\nLeft to right: Sean De Four, Samaritas vice president; refugees living in metro Detroit: Sube Jafas, Sabah Estephan, Qussay Al Juboury, Atifa Al Juboury, Abduladheem Alanbagi.

That made him and his sisters targets, forcing them to leave. They are Chaldeans (Iraqi Catholics), a minority in Iraq, and while the Trump ban on refugees made exceptions for religious minorities, Estephan said his sisters were let in because of the ruling by the federal judge.\nHe hopes the 9th Circuit decision stands.\n\"It's hurt so many people,\" Estephan said of the executive order. \"America is an immigrant country, for everyone who wants freedom, to start a new life and take their role to build this great country.\"\nEntezari worries about future orders, saying \"I wonder what was the rationale of President Trump to implement this executive order? How is this constitutional? This administration is discriminating against other people based on their religion, and ethnic background.\"\nRight now, \"it's very scary for us,\" Entezari said. \"It's so sad we can't see our family anymore. ... Right now, it's not going to happen.\"\nSherry Saadati, 32, and Roozbeh Entezari, 41, of Pittsfield Township (Photo: Roozbeh Entezari)\nSahar Rahketfe, a friend of of the couple who previously lived in Michigan and tried to help publicize their case after Saadati was initially barred, said \"there's still such a looming large cloud of uncertainty for her family in Iran. Will she be able to go visit them again? And for many people we know who live in Iran and who can no longer visit us here, and for those with visas or those who had planned to get student or work visas to come here.\"\n\"It's extremely disheartening that this is even happening.\"\nContact Niraj Warikoo:313-223-4792 or nwarikoo@freepress.com.
