Jason Merritt, Getty Images None 2005 | Best actress: Hilary Swank in Guy Laroche | When it comes to a total look, just one something should stand out, from a red lip to (in Swank's case) a bare back. The body-skimming, embellishment-free frock was all about form, whose function was to flaunt Swank's enviable figure. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2005 | Best supporting actress: Cate Blanchett in Valentino | It foreshadowed the frenzy for all things asymmetrical, and it coupled a pair of unexpected, but complementary, colors: yellow and burgundy. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2006 | Best actress: Reese Witherspoon in vintage Christian Dior | When Witherspoon won that year for 'Walk the Line,' she told reporters she found her 1955 gown while shopping at a vintage boutique in Paris. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2006 | Best supporting actress: Rachel Weisz in Narciso Rodriguez | The actress was pregnant with her son Henry (with former partner Darren Aronofsky) when she won for her work in 'The Constant Gardener.' Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2007 | Best actress: Helen Mirren in Christian Lacroix | Mirren won that year for 'The Queen,' and turned up at the Academy Awards looking quite royal. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2007 | Best supporting actress: Jennifer Hudson in Oscar de la Renta | Despite stealing the show in 'Dreamgirls,' on the red carpet, Hudson's choice of a chocolate taffeta gown with a contrasting bolero was panned by critics. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2008 | Best actress: Marion Cotillard in Jean Paul Gaultier| If Aphrodite were brunette (and French), she'd channel Cotillard on the biggest night of her professional life. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2008 | Best supporting actress: Tilda Swinton in Lanvin | The Hefty bag (to paraphrase one of the kinder armchair critiques) worn by Swinton has emerged as the epitome of how, on the right person with the right confidence, chic and street can coexist, even on the world's most-watched red carpet. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2009 | Best actress: Kate Winslet in Atelier Yves Saint Laurent | Winslet won that year for 'The Reader' in a one-shouldered deep blue gown. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2009 | Best supporting actress: Penelope Cruz in vintage Pierre Balmain | Cruz won for 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona' and scooped up her Oscar in a romantic strapless gown with her hair swept up in a chignon. Frazer Harrison, Getty Images None 2010 | Best actress: Sandra Bullock in Marchesa | Sandy is not the kind of girl to let a dress overwhelm her when she clutches her gold man, according to stylist Phillip Bloch. \"She isn't going to wear a big ballgown,\" he says, but notes that the understated look was more remarkable in the silvery flesh. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2010 | Best supporting actress: Mo'Nique in Tadashi Shoji | It was a vibrant shade of blue for a vibrant woman. The comedian-cum-actress wanted to wear the ocean, says designer Tadashi Shoji. The asymmetrical neckline also added a touch of trend. Kevin Winter, Getty Images None 2011 | Best actress: Natalie Portman in Rodarte | The 'Black Swan' star, then pregnant with her first child, famously declined to wear a Dior dress to the Oscars that year (she was the face of a Dior fragrance) after then-head designer John Galliano was revealed to have made anti-Semitic remarks. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2011 | Best supporting actress: Melissa Leo in Marc Bouwer | The star of 'The Fighter' chose a custom lace column gown for her big moment. \"I feel like a princess,\" she told USA TODAY. \"It's very comfortable.\" Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2012 | Best actress: Meryl Streep in Lanvin | Streep had won two trophies before, but leave it to her third award, at the age of 62, for her to shine sartorially as well as dramatically. Not since Julie Christie's turn as Oscar's 1966 'Darling'had gold and gold gone hand-in-hand so beautifully. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2012 | Best supporting actress: Octavia Spencer in Tadashi Shoji | Spencer \"asked for a goddess dress. She didn't say anything other than that,\" Shoji says. Spencer's response to Shoji's glittery gown? \"Oh, it's so beautiful!\" he recalls her saying. \"She loved it.\" Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY None 2013 | Best actress: Jennifer Lawrence in Dior | Yes, JLaw and Dior have a contractual collaboration.

Todd Plitt, USA TODAY None 2014 | Best supporting actress: Lupita Nyong'o in Prada | The '12 Years A Slave' star hit the red carpet wearing a custom light blue silk georgette gown with a deep V-neck top and low cut sides. \"It's a blue that reminds me of Nairobi, and so I wanted to have a little bit of home,\" she told E!'s Ryan Seacrest. Jordan Strauss, Invision via AP None 2015 | Best actress: Julianne Moore in Chanel | Moore, who won for 'Still Alice,' wore a shimmering, strapless custom gown designed by Karl Lagerfeld. It took a whopping 927 hours to create. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2015 | Best supporting actress: Patricia Arquette in Rosetta Getty | The 'Boyhood' actress took home her statuette in a black and white one-shoulder gown, and memorably called for wage equality from the Oscar stage. Frazer Harrison, Getty Images None 2016 | Best actress: Brie Larson in Gucci | Larson took home her Oscar statuette for 'Room' and donned a royal blue custom gown for the big day. Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY None 2016 | Best supporting actress: Alicia Vikander in Louis Vuitton | The 'Danish Girl' star's glittering yellow gown drew comparisons to 'Beauty and the Beast,' which didn't upset her in the least. \"I think if you would've asked 5-year-old Alicia what her biggest dream was, it was probably to be Belle,\" she told 'Entertainment Tonight.'
