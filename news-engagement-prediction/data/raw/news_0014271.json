In an exasperated rant in Swedish on Facebook the officer, Peter Springare, conceded it was not politically correct to say so, but nearly all the serious crime cases he had dealt with over the past week involved migrants – and that the situation had been ongoing for the last decade or more.\nDescribing his week, he posted: “Here we go; this is what I’ve handled from Monday-Friday this week: rape, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, rape-assault and rape, extortion, blackmail, assault, violence against police, threats to police, drug crime, drugs, crime, felony, attempted murder, Rape again, extortion again and ill-treatment.\n“Suspected perpetrators; Ali Mohammed, Mahmod, Mohammed, Mohammed Ali, again, again, again Christopher… what is it true? Yes a Swedish name snuck in on the edges of a drug crime. Mohammed, Mahmod Ali, again and again.\n“Countries representing the all the crimes this week: Iraq, Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Somalia, Syria again, Somalia, unknown, unknown country, Sweden. Half of the suspects, we can’t be sure because they don’t have any valid papers. Which in itself usually means that they’re lying about their nationality and identity.”\n“Now, we’re talking just Örebro municipality. And these crimes take up our capacity to investigate 100 per cent. This is what it looks like here, and has been like for the past 10-15 years.”\nSpringare, who is nearing retirement after 47 years on the force added: “I’m so fucking tired.”\nResponding to accusations of racism within the comments of his post, he added , in a new post: “If you can’t discuss the problem of crime among immigrants without it being called racist propaganda, things are very bad.”\nDenying that he was in any way racist, and voicing support for orderly, controlled immigration, he added: “However, I am very concerned about crime and the intent of immigrant criminals, which strongly overload and is about to overturn our justice system. The problem is that nobody wants to talk about this.”\nA report last year found more than 55 no go zones in Sweden where violent crime is flourishing as the police are unable to enter them. Attacks on emergency services workers has also risen, leading to three police officers a day quitting the force.\nMr Springare is not the only person to have come under fire for pointing out the crisis. The Czech author Katerina Janouch was accused of “spreading Russian propaganda” for suggesting that interest in learning how to shoot was on the rise as people were scared for their safety.\nSwedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven called her statements “strange”, but a Swedish citizen defended her, telling the Express: “Katerina pointed out there are a number of areas in Sweden where the police, fire services, emergency services, won’t go and they are not the only ones.”\nFollow Donna Rachel Edmunds on Twitter: Follow @Donna_R_E or e-mail to: dedmunds@breitbart.com Immigration , Europe Migrant Crisis , Migrant Crime , police force , Sweden", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/peter.springare/posts/10208300682343230?pnref=story", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F05%2Fpolice-officer-almost-serious-crime-committed-migrants%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Police+Officer%3A+Almost+All+Serious+Crime+Committed+By+Migrants", "http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/756513/Sweden-welfare-state-destroyed-political-correctness-migrant-policy", "https://twitter.com/Donna_R_E", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F05%2Fpolice-officer-almost-serious-crime-committed-migrants%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Police+Officer%3A+Almost+All+Serious+Crime+Committed+By+Migrants&shortener=bitly", "https://www.facebook.com/peter.springare/posts/10208304206871341?pnref=story", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F05%2Fpolice-officer-almost-serious-crime-committed-migrants%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Police+Officer%3A+Almost+All+Serious+Crime+Committed+By+Migrants"], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T20:27:38.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
