Deep in the cold war we covered a story from the former eastern bloc state. It seemed students learned languages more rapidly when “taught” by recordings in their sleep. The phenomenon even had a name – hypnopaedia. We reported on 24 February the case of two Soviet students who had acquired passable English in only 14 nights. Not surprisingly, there were sceptics, especially when it emerged the lessons conducted during sleep simply repeated what the students had heard while awake. V. Fried, a Czechoslovak lecturer in English, thought that “the amount of tuition the students received while they were awake plus their homework” easily accounted for their fluency. Still, it might have made teachers feel happier about sending their students to sleep. \nMore prospective pseudoscience appeared in our 26 February 1976 issue . Two hundred scientists had felt it necessary to rubbish astrology in the journal Humanist , prompting us to examine the work of Michel Gauquelin at his Paris-based Laboratory for the Study of Relationships between Cosmic and Psycho-Physiological Rhythms. Gauquelin had “amassed mountains of statistical evidence to prove that correlations do exist between planet positions and human activities”. We spluttered a bit, but concluded that his work had more scientific credibility than horoscopes or Uri Geller-style spoon-bending. We even suggested that such lab work would continue long after Geller and his like had been forgotten. Erm… \nFourteen years on, we showed we weren’t above dubious causal inferences of our own. In the 3 February 1990 issue our Feedback columnist apologised for any deficiencies in the magazine. Apparently “a window blew in on one of the top floors of the tower block in which New Scientist was based” and everyone had to be evacuated – an excuse as flimsy as that window frame. \nMore on these topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T09:29:38.650+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
