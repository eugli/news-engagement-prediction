When members emerged, they voted unanimously to hire the Miller Canfield law firm. \nRelated: \n\"We are authorizing DPSCD to take legal action when timely and appropriate to present why we believe these school closures cannot legally move forward,\" Iris Taylor, the board president, said while reading a statement after the board voted. \nShe said the board hopes to avoid legal action. \n\"However, we reserve the right to do so,\" Taylor said. \nThe state School Reform Office announced last month that 38 schools statewide will potentially close at the end of the current school year because they've been ranked in the bottom 5% academically for three straight years, from 2014 to 2016. Such schools are called priority schools. \nThe list included 25 schools in Detroit â€” 16 in the Detroit district, eight in the Education Achievement Authority, and one charter school. \nThe achievement authority, a state reform district that opened in 2012 to turn around some of the worst-performing schools in Detroit, is being phased out after this school year and the schools returned to the Detroit district. \nThe school reform office has been under fire since it started aggressively trying to intervene with failing schools. The East Detroit Public Schools last year sued the state to block the office's plan to appoint a CEO to take over the academics of four of its schools. The four schools had been on the priority list, but three of them have since been removed. The lawsuit, meanwhile, is before the Michigan Court of Claims. \nThe office is to make final closure decisions by later this month or early March. A school can get a reprieve if the office determines that closing a school would pose a hardship for students who would not be able to enroll in a better-performing nearby school. \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:18:07.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
