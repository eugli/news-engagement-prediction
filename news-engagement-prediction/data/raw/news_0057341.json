Saudi textbooks have turned up in Isis territory,” Mr Jones told The Independent .\n“The big difference with Saudi is it’s not an international pariah or terrorist organisation, it’s a close ally of Britain and America…it’s blatant double standards.”\nHe spoke on the issue at the Geneva Sumit for Human Rights and Democracy, held at the start of the UN Human Rights Council session at Switzerland’s Palais des Nations. \nSaudi Arabia has positioned itself as a partner in the US-led coalition’s operations against Isis, which has launched several terror attacks in the country, as well as hosting the training of Syrian rebels to fight jihadis and combating the group’s financing.\nBut a cache of leaked Isis registration documents revealed Saudis make up the highest number of foreigners i n the group's ranks.\nThe country's counter-terror efforts have also been dogged by persistent comparisons with the so-called Islamic State, which shares parts of its ideology with the fundamentalist Wahhabism promoted by Riyadh.\nThe ideology has fuelled its mutual animosity with Shia-majority countries including Iran, with the two nations fighting a proxy war across the Middle East and Asia.\nYemen's prime minister accuses UK of war crimes One of the fronts is in Yemen, where a Saudi-led air coalition is bombing Iran-backed Houthi rebels in support of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi’s government.\nThe UN says more than 10,000 civilians have been killed in the two-year conflict, which has left millions facing starvation and without access to water and healthcare.\nRead more Saudi air strike kills 10 women and children in Yemen Boris Johnson pressed for UK to keep selling bombs to Saudi Arabia Now the High Court must decide if we're complicit in the Yemen war Much of the destruction has been blamed on Saudi Arabia’s air campaign, which has seen funerals and homes bombed in indiscriminate raids that may amount to war crimes.\nBritish-made cluster bombs and munitions have been used in the attacks as weapons sales worth billions of pounds continue, despite calls for the deadly trade to be put on hold .\nThe UK has referred probes into civilian deaths to the Saudi-led coalition’s Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT), which is accused of falling short of international standards of transparency and impartiality.\nMr Jones called for independent investigations into alleged violations, arguing parties in the conflict were “pretty unlikely to accuse themselves of war crimes”.\n\"I think it’s extraordinary that there’s not more of an outcry over Yemen,” he added, condemning \"hypocrisy\" by the UK.\nA judicial review is underway at the High Court over whether British arms sales violate the Government’s own restrictions on selling weapons that could be used to commit war crimes. \nThe situation in Yemen 14 show all The situation in Yemen 1/14 Houthi supporters trample on a US flag during a gathering mobilizing more fighters into several Yemeni battlefronts, in Sana'a, Yemen\nEPA\n2/14 People carry the coffins of men, who were killed in the recent Saudi-led airstrikes during their funeral, in the Old City of Sanaa, Yemen\nAP\n3/14 Pro-government fighters give food to Yemeni children on the road leading to the southwestern port city of Mokha.
