Her friends, family, classmates, and sorority sisters are shocked and in mourning after a horrific accident left her dead at an off-campus fraternity party in October.\nThe Associated Press reports that Taylor was found under a shuttle bus at an off-campus fraternity party. The bus had been experiencing mechanical problems so it was left at the venue, and her body was found after people went to fix the bus the next day. Officials say her injuries show she was struck by the bus and dragged more than 500 feet to her death.\nMy heart is hurting for all reasons Jordin Emily Taylor. You left an impact on me and I'll cherish you forever. It's just not fair. #RIP ❤️ pic.twitter.com/wEw9D0pEZZ\n— Nicole Carter (@nicoleashcarter) October 31, 2016 Authorities say her death appeared to be an accident. Now, according to the Austin-American Statesman , four fraternities affiliated with the event have been suspended for alcohol violations associated with the party. They are now prohibited from acting as a fraternity on campus and must suspend official activities for anywhere from two to five years. One of those fraternities, Alpha Tau Omega, has been closed by its national organization.\n Taylor was majoring in respiratory care and was a member of the Alpha Delta Pi sorority. Loved ones remember how caring and optimistic she was, even after the death of her mother in 2012. \"She was the funniest person I knew, by far,\" close friend Reagan O'Brien told the Statesman . \"No matter what she went through or what was going on, she was always happy and smiling.\"\nFrom: Seventeen\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.mystatesman.com/news/local/friends-honor-texas-state-student-found-dead-under-bus-last-weekend/Owdy2UAmwS6yiURJ6aN2HN/", "http://www.statesman.com/news/local/texas-state-university-student-found-dead-under-shuttle-bus/MgMb3AfaPAbIPpraDSyfIO/", "http://www.statesman.com/news/breaking-news/texas-state-suspends-fraternities-tied-party-where-student-killed-bus/LfhEigTXlyIIeHs8yJKm1K/", "https://t.co/wEw9D0pEZZ", "https://twitter.com/nicoleashcarter/status/793109817225191424", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/RIP?src=hash", "https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1130784676985872&set=a.100108646720152.9.100001630500022&type=3&theater", "http://www.seventeen.com/life/school/news/a44786/jordin-taylor-texas-state-fraternity-party-accident/"], "published": "2017-02-02T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T22:00:58.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
