He says he forgot about an unhooked gas main, turn on the gas and fried a steak, causing the explosion. \nBasil Lloydd​ had just begun to enjoy retirement when he blew up his motorhome while cooking dinner. \n\"All my fault. I just can't blame anyone else but myself,\" the Taupo man says. \nHis saving grace is that despite being badly injured, his first thought was for his campground neighbours. DOMINICO ZAPATA/FAIRFAX NZ \nBasil Lloydd, 65, remains in Waikato Hospital, where he has been since the explosion. \nAfter a life-long career as a forestry worker, the 65-year-old widower sold his house and bought a motorhome in August 2016. \nREAD MORE: \nHe spent Friday, February 10, at the National Equestrian Centre in Taupo pulling an old fridge out of the campervan with a friend. It involved disconnecting the gas line. DOMINICO ZAPATA/FAIRFAX NZ \nBasil Lloydd''s legs and arms were badly burnt and he'll require skin grafts. \n\"We took the old one out, brought the new one in, got everything sized up, did the necessary trimmings, and had it all set there for the people that were going to install it. \n\"For some silly reason, I never closed the end of the gas pipe off.\" That night, Lloydd turned on the gas to cook his dinner. \n\"The gas must have been pouring out, but I couldn't smell it.\" STEPH RANGI/FAIRFAXNZ \nBasil Lloydd, despite being badly burned, jumped into the driver's seat and drove the burning campervan 100m away to save his neighbours' motorhomes. \nHe wasn't drunk. \"The last beer I had was possibly five or six hours before that.\" \nHe sparked the hob, heated the pan, fried one side of the steak and turned it over. \nThen, ka-boom. DOMINICO ZAPATA/FAIRFAX NZ \nBasil Lloydd, 65, was seriously burned when his motorhome exploded on February 10. \nThe explosion blew out both sides of the campervan and set fire to his bed. Lloydd suffered serious burns to his arms and legs. \nDespite that, he joined neighbouring campers in attempting to put out the fire. \nThey emptied three fire extinguishers on it, but the fire kept burning. He was worried it would spread to his neighbours' vehicles. STEPH RANGI/FAIRFAXNZ \nThe gas explosion burst through two sides of the motorhome. \n\"I knew there was an area with short grass and I had an idea there was a hose there ... so I jumped in my motorhome, started it up.\" \nHe drove the burning vehicle 100 metres away from other campers and doused it with a hose. \n\"Then I turned the hose on to myself.\" \nFortunately, the flames did not reach the LPG and petrol tanks. Emergency services arrived shortly after and took Lloydd to Waikato Hospital. He faces a lengthy recovery, including skin grafts on his legs. \nLloydd didn't have insurance for the campervan and hopes to repair the damage. Fellow New Zealand Motor Caravan Association (NZMCA) members have offered their support, and friends and family are raising money on his behalf. \nHe advises all motorhome owners to install gas detectors. \n​\"If I had one of those in there ... that thing would've been beeping.\" \nFire inspector John Rewi agrees it was an avoidable fire. \nLiquefied petroleum gas is heavier than air, so the gas would have stayed low as it built up. \nRewi says it is essential to ensure the gas is switched off when connecting and disconnecting vehicles. \nHe also advised motorhome users to install smoke alarms and gas detectors. \n\"There were no smoke alarms in this vehicle … there is only one means of escape … so you need to have early warning of any sort of fire.\" \nNZMCA chief executive Bruce Lochore says it is disappointing to hear of such an accident. \n\"[Lloydd] understood that he was supposed to do something, but you know, just a lapse in concentration and that's why you have professionals deal with dangerous things like this.\" \nNZMCA recommends that qualified professions do any gas work on motorhomes. \"The biggest lesson to be learnt out of this is that people just can't do their own thingn.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T06:07:48.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
