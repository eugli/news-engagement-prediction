Sivarraajh.\nKhairul Azwan said it was also evident from the statements that the embassy had blatantly and undiplomatically defamed Malaysia by claiming that it was “susceptible to foreign interventions and open to manipulation over a hidden agenda”. \n“We gather here today to condemn and hand in a memorandum of protest,” he said, vowing to organise a bigger demonstration should the embassy continue to disrespect Malaysia’s rule of law. \nThe 90-minute protest saw a large presence of policemen, as well as foreign and local reporters, in the surrounding area despite heavy rain. \nEarlier in the morning, an embassy staff member told reporters standing outside the gate to leave and threatened to call the police. \nThe reporters had been waiting for a scheduled press conference by the embassy from as early as 9am but it was later cancelled. \nAt about 3pm, the area in front of the embassy was cordoned off by police after some media personnel disrupted traffic.\nThe newsmen were also asked to wait on the opposite side of the road from the front gate of the embassy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:52:37.033+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
