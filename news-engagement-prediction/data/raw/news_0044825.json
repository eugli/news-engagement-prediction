An additional 1,500 middle school and high school students staged walkouts Thursday and Friday as part of the protests against President Donald Trump's tough stance on immigration. \nDISD is not required keep track of the percentage of its students who are living in the district without legal permission, but a change in the country's immigration policy would likely affect the tens of thousands of students and their families. The district is 70 percent Hispanic, with 44 percent of its 157,000 students identified as having limited English proficiency. \nThe absences hit DISD in the pocketbook, costing the district from $500,000 to $750,000 in state funding tied to attendance. \n\"While we respect everyone's right to voice their opinion, we encourage all students to remain in school,\" the robocall said. \"When students leave campus without permission, they are in violation of district policy - which can create additional risks to their well-being.\" \nDistrict leaders admitted that they are trying to walk a delicate line, attempting to be apolitical while respecting student dissent. \n\"As a district, we are trying to balance our student's rights to civilly protest without getting into the area of dictating to them what they can and can't do,\" DISD chief of school leadership Stephanie Elizalde said. \"We don't want to add fuel to their existing fire. We want to be sensitive to their concerns. But our mission is educating them; we can't just turn a blind eye to the fact that they are absent and missing instructional time.\" DISD Attendance Letter by Corbett Smith on Scribd \nAny absence as a result of the protests would be treated as unexcused, Elizalde said, meaning that students would not be able to make up missed assignments. Absences would also count against state requirements that students participate in 90 percent of class time throughout the school year. \nBut no further disciplinary action would be taken, Elizalde said.
