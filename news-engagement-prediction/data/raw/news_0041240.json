Southern says it expects to run around three-quarters of its usual timetable during the strike. \nThe row over the roles and responsibilities of train crew is likely to be replicated across other parts of Britain’s railway. A ballot for strikes on the Northern network began on Thursday over what the RMT described as a “failure to give assurances on guards”, with new trains expected from 2018 that could be operated by drivers alone. \nMerseyrail plans to operate trains without guards from 2020, although it has promised to redeploy staff. The government is encouraging bidders for future franchises, including South West, to come up with plans to phase out guards, with new trains designed to be operated by drivers alone.
