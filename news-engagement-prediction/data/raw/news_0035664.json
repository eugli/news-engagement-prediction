Chronic opioid use, particularly in older people, can contribute to spiraling problems: constipation , confusion, falls and addiction. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But the risk of becoming that patient increased or decreased depending on the treating physician. Researchers found that doctors they identified as “high-intensity” prescribers sent one in four patients home with opioids. “Low-intensity” prescribers gave opioids to one in 14 patients. The patients who saw a high-intensity prescriber were 30 percent more likely to become long-term users, researchers said. The study’s lead author, Dr. Michael L. Barnett , an assistant professor of health policy and management at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the point of the findings was “not that high-intensity prescribers are necessarily irresponsible in prescribing opioids to certain patients.” But, he said, “Their patients have worse outcomes that we weren’t aware of before.” Experts in emergency medicine, geriatrics and medical toxicology praised the study. “It puts the burden on us in the E.R. to be even more thoughtful about how to do things,” said Dr. Nelson, who served on the expert panel for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that helped develop opioid guidelines in 2016. Although researchers looked at the strength and duration of the initial prescription, they did not find that the high-intensity prescribers necessarily prescribed doses that were higher or longer lasting. Dr. Barnett, a primary care physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, said that the critical first step was the decision itself about whether to prescribe opioids, “regardless of how much or how little.” The disparity in prescribing patterns, he said, demonstrates that “there is no consensus among E.R. doctors who are treating similar patients about when to prescribe opioids and what dose to give, and the lack of guidance for how to treat acute pain.” More Reporting on Opioids “Doctors may have an intuitive sense, but when you rely on intuition, you get inconsistency,” he said. “You get overtreatment and also undertreatment.” The study did not seek to lay blame for the well-documented rise in opioid use by Medicare patients at the feet of emergency room doctors. Indeed, after patients receive an opioid prescription from the emergency room , they usually have subsequent prescriptions written by doctors outside the hospital, especially primary care physicians . The study’s authors alluded to “clinical inertia” — the belief among follow-up physicians that if the emergency room doctor’s prescription did the trick, they might as well refill it. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Emergency department physicians note that older adults present unique, limiting challenges that further complicate pain management decisions. For any number of events — a twisted ankle, aching gut, or throbbing neck — younger adult patients can often be successfully treated with anti-inflammatory drugs, such as naproxen or ibuprofen, and an ice pack.
