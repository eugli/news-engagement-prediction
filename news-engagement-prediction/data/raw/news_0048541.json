Woman thought she was pregnant but she actually had a cancer tumour \nHe said: ‘It was about tea time when we had just finished our food and was about to leave when my mate dropped his phone and couldn’t find it. \n‘We put the flash on our phones to light up underneath our sets so he could find the phone and I saw this rat dead in a rat trap.’ \nHe captured the rodent in a Snapchat video before informing a member of staff. The restaurant was given a five out of five rating at its last insepction (Picture: Masons) \nWill said: ‘We called the manager over straight away and he told us there were traps because the farmers have been on the fields so the rats had come in. \n‘I thought the restaurant would have to close if there was a problem with rats.’ Night Tube workers to be balloted for strikes six months after service started \nMr Robinson claims the manager offered the group a free meal on their next visit. \nHe said: ‘We won’t be taking up the offer – none of us want to eat there again. The discovery of the rat has put us off completely. \n‘Finding the rat was such a big shock. Seeing it made us feel physically sick. It is a popular place and a lot of families go there. It’s not good at all.’ \nAccording to the Food Standards Agency the restaurant was last inspected for food hygiene in January 2016. Just one £5 note worth £50,000 left to be found \nInspectors awarded it the top ‘very good’ five out of five rating. \nA spokesperson for Brewer’s Fayre said: ‘We are extremely sorry to learn of this incident and would like to apologise sincerely to these guests. \n‘We pride ourselves on maintaining exemplary standards of health and safety and this is completely unacceptable. \n‘We have conducted a thorough inspection and are confident that there is no evidence of current pest activity at the site. We are also looking into how this could have happened as a matter of priority.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T10:29:22.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
