Ruth Negga (Photo: REUTERS) \nNegga was followed by the Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and his mother who both wore the pin. Miranda is nominated for writing music and lyrics for How Far I'll Go from animated movie Moana. \nDirector of best film nominee Moonlight, Barry Jenkins, was also spotted with the blue bow pinned to his suit. \nThe ACLU was among the first to launch a legal challenge following President Trump's travel ban, which bars people from seven Muslim-majority countries entering America. \nWhile the travel ban has been blocked by the courts, a revamped refugee and immigration executive order is expected to be released by the White House next week. Karlie Kloss (Photo: AFP/Getty) \nSupermodel Karlie Kloss also opted to make her outfit political as she arrived on the red carpet wearing the accessory just above her hip. \nKloss' boyfriend is Josh Kushner, the brother of President Trump's son-in-law and senior White House adviser, Jared Kushner. \nManchester By The Sea star Casey Affleck wore the blue ribbon on his lapel at Saturday's Film Independent Spirit Awards, where he won best male lead.

A lot of it depends on what happens.\" Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:48:08.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
