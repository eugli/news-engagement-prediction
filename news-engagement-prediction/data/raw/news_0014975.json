The cobra flicks its forked tongue out clearly hungry for the kittens behind the window They said: 'Be aware. If you keep flowers or a small tree, don't make it near the window of the house. Luckily the window glass was not open.' The clip was given to the government by the person who lives in the house. He said that his niece had filmed it.

Despite the cobra slamming its head against the window, the curious kitten below is unfazed 'I have visited the house where it happened and spoken to the family. A young girl recorded the video. 'The family want to help people to remember not to leave their windows open or to have trees and plants near them. This makes it easy for snakes to get inside and can be dangerous. 'Take care to make sure there are no trees near windows and close the windows.'
