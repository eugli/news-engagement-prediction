The demonstrators reportedly even threw a Molotov cocktail at police, who had to bring a water cannon to the central square. \nAs a result, at least one officer was taken to the hospital after receiving a burn to his leg, according to the regional newspaper Ouest-France, which said that two people were arrested, and three more taken to a police station for identification checks.
