On AAP government's completion of two years on February 14, Sisodia spoke about their government's road map and roadblocks they encounter. \n\nAre you able to look back with satisfaction at what your government has achieved in the past year? \n\nThe past one year has been a little disturbing because of the attitude of the lieutenant governor (Najeeb Jung), the high court order and interference by the Centre in day-to-day functioning of Delhi government. They kept cancelling our orders. In an unconstitutional manner, services became a transferred subject and we lost control over administration. That had consequences. Then, on completely flimsy grounds, CBI inquiries were started. We are not scared of CBI inquiries but officers are being harassed. They are being forced to name top people in the government. There is fear among officers. In the past five to six months, particularly, there has been pressure on the officers -- that if they are close to the AAP government or if they work, they will get into trouble. And those who are getting scared are unable to work. \n\nGive two examples of work which the government had prioritised but could not execute. \n\nWe have not been able to sort out the matter of new buses. The minister concerned has been struggling with the files for the past seven-eight months. He has been writing to officers who are using excuses like the need for a 'scientific' study for this project. A study has been done but who is to say whether it is 'scientific' or not. \n\nThe transport bus aggregator system was another casualty. The Union finance minister appreciated the scheme, informally of course, during a GST meeting. He said this scheme is the solution to all transport problems in the country â€” to open up the market to private players under government regulations and letting the fare be market-driven, under a specified cap. This conversation took place in Kolkata. When I returned to Delhi four days later, I discovered a CBI inquiry had been started into the scheme. Then there is Wi-Fi. We have been struggling to issue even the request for proposal. \n\nHow is the new LG different from his predecessor? \n\nHe is more open to ideas and discussions. Initially, Jung was also open to ideas but later became resistant to everything. Let us be optimistic. Maybe the Centre has also understood this situation is to nobody's advantage. Our relations with the new LG have been very good so far. \n\nThe last file he cleared was the one for setting up mohalla clinics in government schools. I have discussed several ideas, rejected by the earlier LG, with him and he is open to these. On something like mohalla sabhas, I am optimistic because he was the person who introduced the idea of area sabhas under JNNURM. I had an idea for a new kind of school in Delhi. Jung had rejected it but the new LG has agreed to discuss it. Lots of files have been returned for largely corrective measures. Nothing major has been rejected so far. \n\nWhat will you identify as your main achievements? \n\nIn many colonies with pipelines, there was no water. Everything was ready but for that last, small connection. Had that happened, it would have put the tanker mafia out of business. We got all water treatment plants started. Water has reached areas like Sangam Vihar, Deoli etc. In the past two years, 300-400 unauthorised colonies have started getting water. Our flagship promise was about water bills. Now, around 12-15 lakh bills are zero. Everyone is talking about mohalla clinics. About 20 lakh people have visited these clinics. People are getting 1,400 medicines. Then there is education. \n\nName a few things that you have managed to change in the education system in Delhi. \n\nInfrastructure was a key problem. There were 150 children in one class and it was impossible to teach. We have 8,000 new classrooms and another 8,000 on paper. Once we have these 16,000 classrooms, I can promise that in next 20 years, there will be no problem in infrastructure of public schools. \n\nThen comes the quality of infrastructure. Government buildings are made in such a way that there is no decoration, nothing to inspire children. Many government schools are now at par with private schools in this aspect. Quality of teachers is another issue. Teachers are considered to be like any other government employee whereas the government needs to invest in them the most. \n\nI raised the budget for training of teachers. They have been going to Oxford and Cambridge for training. Recently, I met a principal who changes the seating pattern in the school based on what the children want on any given day. Her approach has changed and she has made the school more colourful. Then through the parent-teacher meetings, we have created dialogue. During a PTM, I met one teacher right after she had met a student's father -- she was crying. She said the father wakes up at 5 am, cleans cars and then sells vegetables. The teacher had thought that the student's parents were careless but now she understood that it was her duty to care for the child since the parents had no time. \n\nDo you have enough number of teachers? \n\nYes, I have. Earlier, there were classes where 150 children were being taught by one teacher. To deal with this, I got 8000 new classrooms made. Another 8000 will be added. So, I need more teachers for the rooms being added....We have guest teachers and we are increasing their salaries. It is almost done. We have spoken to the LG and he has given some suggestions to tweak the proposal and he has said he will approve it with those changes, probably in a week. When we came to power for 49 days in 2014, we found that DSSSB (Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board) had not recruited for vacancies pending since 2007-08. In the past one-and-a-half years, we have taken measures to reduce pendency. We have made 5,500 fresh recruitments. I think they have cleared the backlog till 2013-14. \n\nWhat is your vision for the next few years? What are your priorities? \n\nThere is talk of concepts like world class and smart city. What makes a city smart? Governance. You need to have infrastructural development also but that is the hardware of a smart city. My focus is on the software of governance. For instance, we should have the data of all 0-3-year-old children. \n\nTracking of a child should start from the stage when an expecting mother registers with the doctor or hospital. This kind of database consolidated and updated continuously will give the government a headstart on planning for education and health infrastructure. As of now we lack planning and proper use of technology. I want databases to be updated. Better planning and technology must be used to find practical solutions for public dealing. \n\nWe have taken steps in this direction. To encourage use of e-district portal for applying online for certificates like income, caste and others, we did away with about 150-200 affidavits and allowed self-attestation. Immediately, the number of online applications started growing. Similarly, we have tried to cut down red tape in the process of releasing money to the eligible girl child under the Laadli scheme. We are also trying to work on improving the online appointment process in government hospitals. We will have to think out of box. \n\nWhat do you think is the root cause of the financial crisis in the corporations? AAP is blamed for not doing enough to help them tide over the crisis. \n\nDelhi government has given unprecedented money to the corporations. We have cut the loan or interest amount and grants have also been increased. I feel the corporations have become unaccountable. Nobody questions them, neither the central government, nor ACB. All the money being provided to the corporations is being drained out because of corruption. The most important function of the corporations is looking after sanitation and they have completely failed. This is the reason why people have no trust. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T08:11:30.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
