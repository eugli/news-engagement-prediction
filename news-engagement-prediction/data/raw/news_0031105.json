Key points: More storms are expected for Wednesday and Thursday this week Officials consider using helicopters to drop rocks to block the eroded spillway Shelters are running short on supplies It is the first time all 23,000 California National Guard men have been ready to deploy since the 1992 Los Angeles riots \nBut with more rain expected later in the week, time is running short to fix the damage ahead of the storms. \nOfficials from the California Department of Water Resources said they are considering using helicopters to drop loads of rock on the eroded spillway at Lake Oroville, about 240 kilometres north-east of San Francisco. \nAuthorities ordered mass evacuations yesterday for everyone living below the lake out of concern the spillway could fail and send a 10-metre wall of water roaring downstream — some 188,000 residents of Yuba, Sutter and Butte counties were ordered to leave their homes.

(AP: Marcio Jose Sanchez) \nButte County Sheriff Kory Honea has said the region was not yet safe, but officials were working on a plan for evacuees to return home. \nThe water level in the lake rose significantly in recent weeks after storms dumped rain and snow across California, particularly in northern parts of the state. \nThe high water forced the use of the dam's emergency spillway, or overflow, for the first time in the dam's nearly 50-year history on Saturday.

(AP: Rich Pedroncelli) \nThe threat appeared to ease somewhat on Monday as the water level fell, but with more rain expected on Wednesday and Thursday, officials were rushing to try to fix the damage and hoping to reduce the dam's water level by 15 metres ahead of the storms. \nThe sudden evacuation panicked residents, who scrambled to get their belongings into cars and then grew angry as they sat in bumper-to-bumper traffic hours after the order was given.

I'm trying to get out of here too. I'm worried about the flooding. I've seen the pictures — that's a lot of water.\" \nA Red Cross spokeswoman said more than 500 people showed up at an evacuation centre in Chico, California.
