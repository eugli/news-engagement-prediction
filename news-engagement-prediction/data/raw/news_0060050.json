Vina and Vivian laugh in the face of your mini spring rolls Source: Channel 10 \n“Whenever we go to a Chinese restaurant and we see a table that aren’t Asian eating food, we always say: ‘Fried rice! Spring rolls! Lemon chicken! Steak and black bean!’” they cackled, listing off the usual Anglo go-tos in any Chinese restaurant. \nOver in their house and blissfully unaware of Zina and Vivian had said, salt-of-the-earth married couple Lee and Keith (you know them — the pair who sit on towels so Keith doesn’t spill his beer on the couch) watched the same program — and had a perfect reaction to the talk of Chinese restaurants. \n“What do we normally get?” asked Lee. Lee lists off her favourites. Source: Channel 10 \n“You like special fried rice. You like your spring rolls. Lemon chicken. We get the black bean sauce thing. That’s all we get really, isn’t it?” said Keith. \n“Yeah,” said Lee. “And it’s beautiful.” \nAs was this exchange, guys. Yes hello, I’ll have one black bean sauce thing please Source: Channel 10 \nAs Gok’s on-screen journey into Chinese cooking progressed and he tried his hand at sausage-making, Lee finished with this pearler, unable to hide her confusion: \n“I’ve never seen a Chinese eat a sausage, have you? I’ve NEVER seen a Chinese eat a sausage.” \nGogglebox screens 7:30pm Wednesdays on Foxtel’s Lifestyle Channel, then 9pm Thursdays on Ten.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:08:13.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
