The former record would only tie Milwaukee for third place in the National League Central Division standings, well behind the Chicago Cubs and even the Pittsburgh Pirates. \nThe PECOTA system, which stands for Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm, correctly projected all five National League playoff teams (the Cardinals weren’t one) last year. \nBut Matheny, who had been doing his reading, said, “That’s unbelievable. Yeah, I saw it. I hope the guys saw it, too. I’m not going to make a big deal of it, though. \n“I’m not going to beat up what the rest of the world is saying _ trying to prove everybody wrong,” said Matheny. “I just want to make sure our guys take a good look around and see what we really are and what we have. \n“We’ve got guys who are motivated. Guys have an edge as to how it finished last year. We’ve got the makings of a fun, fun season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:11:47.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
