playing games, cooking food, but not drinking caffeine - before undergoing the same test.\nTo screen them, the researchers zapped magnetic waves at the motor cortex - the brain region that controls movement - to trigger a twitch in the left hand.\nThey found the sleep-deprived participants barely needed any magnetic pulse to trigger a reaction.\nThat suggested their brain is more 'excitable' than those who are well-rested, and therefore the synpases - which connect brain neurons - are stronger.\nProfessor Christoph Nissen, the psychiatrist who led the study, then got the groups to carry out word-pair activities that rely on creating new memories.\nIn these tests, the sleep-deprived participants fared far worse than their well-rested peers.\nIt suggested that without sleep the brain's synapses are saturated, tense and strong; filled with all the memories of the day. It makes us tetchy and unable to think clearly.\nJust one rough night of sleeplessness, Professor Nissen warned, blocks the brain from resetting, leaving the person foggy, slow and relatively unobservant for the rest of the day.\n'Still we do not really know why we spend such a long time of our lives in this inactive state, so sleep must have a very important function,' Nissen explained.\n'Otherwise it's just a very big mistake that evolution made.\n'Our study highlights the importance of sleep, and the notion that sleep is a highly active brain process, not a waste of time.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:05:04.726+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
