(Photo: AP) \nLast season around this time, Syracuse had racked up a 17-8 record, going 8-5 in its conference - numbers that while, fine enough to hope for a bid to the NCAA tournament, aren't ones that point to a Final Four run. The Orange finished the regular season at .500 in the ACC and dropped its first game in the ACC tournament to Pittsburgh, 71-72. \nBut then came the big dance, where they fought their way into the most unlikely Final Four bid - or as unlikely as a Final Four bid can be for a team coached by Jim Boeheim - and were one of the best stories of the tournament (unless you were rooting for Virginia or Dayton or Gonzaga or Middle Tennessee.) \nSo with that, we'll take you to the 2016-17 Syracuse team which is sitting at fourth place in the ACC and has nine losses on the year. And yes, while we're still weeks away from the NCAA tournament, Syracuse's win over Clemson on this Tyus Battle buzzer-beater after coming back from a 12-point deficit is a) exciting b) why you should watch college basketball during the season c) a reminder that Syracuse should rarely be counted out.
