THE WYATT FAMILY \nWhile it’s arguable that the original trio proved to be the most entertaining, we’ve also seen Braun Strowman be brought into the fold – until the WWE draft sent him to Monday Night Raw.

They were like, ‘Ok, we’re looking at Judas (Devlin), he may be the guy who fits in’, that’s when I started to have my hip issues and I needed surgery so that kinda squashed the idea. \n“I didn’t recover as quickly as they wanted, they wanted t to do it anyway and that was when Braun (Strowman) came in there, and he was very new, but they held up until he was ready.” \nIt’s difficult to say how Corbin’s career would have gone had he joined The Wyatt Family. \nWhile he’d learn a lot from Bray, he’s proving to be a fantastic big man with his Lone Wolf gimmick, and who knows, maybe he wouldn’t even be in tonight’s Elimination Chamber match if he was chosen ahead of Strowman? \nDo you think Baron Corbin would have been a good Wyatt Family member?
