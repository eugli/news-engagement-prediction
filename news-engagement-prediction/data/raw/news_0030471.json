It hasn't backed up, which is good.\" \nMr Hoar said the much of the soil on the station was waterlogged due to heavy rains in January and February. \n\"Everywhere is absolutely full of water. The runoff from the rivers into the swamps has filled them to the brim,\" he said. \n\"All the cattle are up on the ridges in the higher country. They are staying out of the lower blacksoil country.\" Photo: A new 50 million litre dam has filled with water at Moroak Station. (Supplied: Moroak Station) \nRain and runoff filled several 50 million litre dams, built on the property last year, for the first time. \n\"They were a lot of money to put in, fuel and machinery hours, so it was good to them fill up straight away,\" Mr Hoar said. \n\"There were no dramas. They filled up well with no [erosion] damage. We've been pretty lucky.\" \nMr Hoar said the good start to the wet season left him feeling confident about the year ahead. \n\"We have had plenty of rain, so it will be a bit later start to our mustering I would say,\" he said. \n\"Then everything should power ahead with our cattle, weight-wise. \n\"The grass is looking good at the moment. It will hold on a bit longer this year.\" \nMr Hoar said he was keeping himself busy during the wet season by manufacturing gates for new yards, ready to be put up in the dry season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:05:49.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
