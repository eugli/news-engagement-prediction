His successor, Rep. Paul Ryan, has promised to reveal the plan to repeal the law by early March.\nBoehner said Republicans will wind up merely fixing Obamacare.\n  \"I shouldn't call it repeal and replace because it's not going to happen,\" Boehner said, according to a report in Politico.\nHe derided the talk of a full repeal and replacement as \"happy talk.\"\nBoehner retired in 2015 after battling Tea Party conservatives since he assumed the title of speaker after the 2010 midterm elections.\nThe conservative House Freedom Caucus, which often sparred with Boehner, tweeted in response to initial reports that it remains \"100 percent committed to full repeal and replace.\"\nWe made a promise to the American people.
