Modernisation of the police and the military will cost Sh25.6 billion. \nHowever, the estimates, presented by National Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich, show that Kenya will be borrow to bridge a Sh582.5 billion deficit between the projected revenues and the planned expenditure. \nThe target for tax revenues, set at Sh1.3 trillion last year, has been adjusted upwards to Sh1.5 trillion in a move that will see the taxman raid more pockets to fund the budget. \nMr Rotich said the raising of the revenue projections was anchored on tax reforms. \n“This performance will be underpinned by ongoing reforms in tax policy and revenue administration, through automation and inter agency-collaboration and connectivity,” Mr Rotich wrote in the estimates. \nHe added: “The government will also complete the review of the income tax law so as to modernise it and align it to international practice.”The budget also allocates Sh100 billion to a salary increment for all civil servants from July 1. \nThe government also set aside Sh7.3 billion for the ongoing irrigation projects countrywide, as well as towards helping to transform agriculture from subsistence to productive commercial farming. \nThe biggest allocation here will be Sh5 billion for input subsidy — including fertilisers and seeds — as well as some Sh1.6 billion for title deeds and Sh1 billion for the crop diversification for miraa (khat) farmers. \nTOURISM RECOVERY \nKenya hopes that the economy, which experienced a drop to 5.7 per cent in the third quarter of 2016 from the 6.2 and 5.9 per cent in the second and first quarters, respectively, will grow at 5.9 per cent in 2017. \nAgriculture and tourism recovery and the completion of roads and rail projects are expected to be the key anchors.Increased from Sh2.48 trillion. \nAccording to the proposed budget, which increased from the Sh2.48 trillion in the 2016/2017 financial year, the budgetary deficit has been pushed up by a one-off allocation for the SGR, without which it would been Sh469.6 billion. \nThe government will fill the gap by borrowing Sh206 billion from the external market and Sh328 billion from the local market. \nThe CS defended Kenya’s debt position and said the debt load will be reduced gradually in subsequent budgets. \nThe government has also allocated Sh640 million to help complete economic stimulus projects started in last year’s budget, including expansion of markets. \nApart from Parliament getting Sh38 billion for modernisation, CDF will make a return through the National Government Constituency Fund, which has received Sh30.9 billion. \nWoman Representatives have been allocated Sh 2.1 billion for affirmative action and social development.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:14:02.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
