On Thursday, Bravo announced that Southern Charm Season 4 will premiere on April 3 . And yes, there is a trailer. Holy stuffed white gator toy , the trailer is outstanding. Truly exhilarating. This will be a season for the books. You’ve really outdone yourself this time, Charmers . You can check out the preview over at Bravo's website . \nSo, who is back for round four? Veteran Charmers Thomas Ravenel, Kathryn Calhoun Dennis, Cameran Eubanks, Shep Rose, Craig Conover, Landon Clements, and Whitney Sudler-Smith all appear in the trailer. Oh, and supporting characters like Naomie Olindo and J.D. Madison are there, too. Everyone is back, baby. \n... Erm, technically, Sudler-Smith is only sort of back? He's no longer part of the main roster , so I guess he's a recurring cast member now. Huh. I hope this doesn’t mean we get less Patricia Altschul . So, who took Sudler-Smith's place? A young gent named Austen Kroll . Huh. I can't wait to find out what he's all about. \nWait. Wait just a darn tootin’ minute. Dennis is back . Dennis did not leave the show after all. Oh, my gosh. I'd all but accepted that Dennis was done with Southern Charm after those now-deleted tweets happened, but it looks like she stuck around after all. And thank goodness. There goes the neighborhood...Southern Charm Season 4's Trailer Is Finally Here and It's Bats--t Crazy, Y'all! https://t.co/8S3xvWHS9C Source: Landon Clements on Twitter \nThere is a moment in the trailer that made me fall in love with Dennis for the zillionth time. And that moment happens while Conover and Rose fight at a party. As the two buddies yell about being \"assholes,\" Dennis strikes a pose and it's something to behold. The pantsuit. The lounging. The clutching of the drink. The beatific expression. K. Dennis is forever an icon. I can't wait to see what she does on Season 4.
