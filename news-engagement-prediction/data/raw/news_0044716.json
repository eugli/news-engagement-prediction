He had a P600,000 bounty on his head. \n\"[Sagasag] was also a subject of several police operations which did not succeed until this incident,\" Sarona said. \nSagasag was first charged with murder over the killing of village chairman Eduardo Wandaga and Magdalena Dacay in Tabuk City in 1995. He was arrested in 1998, but was able to escape prison. \nIn 2001, Sagasag was again arrested and detained at the Kalinga Police Provincial Jail. \nHe, however, was \"rescued\" by his group while being transported from Kalinga to Tuguegarao City, Cagayan via jeepney in 2002. As a result, two jail guards and a student were killed. – with reports from Raymon Dullana / Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
