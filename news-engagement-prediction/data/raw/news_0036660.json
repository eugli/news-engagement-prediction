But it appeared in The Lancet, the prestige-heavy magazine about medicine published in Britain and read with intense care all over the world. Not long after it was published, in 1998, a dark shadow appeared over vaccination, an essential practice for preventing disease. That shadow has not yet disappeared, though many people believe it was banished long ago, after the initial wave of publicity receded. \nThe original article was signed by 13 investigators under the leadership of Andrew Wakefield, a gastroenterologist. It suggested that a routine MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine might lead to “behavioural regression and pervasive developmental disorder” — that is, autism, which was then newly studied and often discussed. \nThose researchers had worked with only a small sample. Their conclusion was no more than speculation. And soon other researchers were reporting back that they couldn’t replicate the Wakefield group’s results. Even so, their paper was widely quoted and MMR rates began dropping in Britain, the U.S. and Canada. Parents were terrified by the possibility of autism. \nThe article was eventually retracted by The Lancet, whose editor called it “utterly false.” It developed that Wakefield had been funded by lawyers involved in lawsuits against vaccine-producing companies. The General Medical Council of Britain struck him off the medical register and he moved to Texas. Today British newspapers routinely call him the “disgraced doctor” and this week a private London college caused a scandal just by inviting him to give a lecture. \nBy then Jenny McCarthy had absorbed Wakefield’s idea and believed it. Her son was diagnosed as autistic and she wanted to know what had caused his condition. She soon became a passionate and highly defensive advocate of what became known as the anti-vaxxers. \nA TV host and the 1994 Playboy Playmate of the Year, McCarthy was already a celebrity and decided to put her fame into the service of this cause. She’s become president of Generation Rescue (“… the leading national organization that provides hope, information and immediate treatment assistance to families affected by autism spectrum disorders”). She defends Wakefield as one authority who listened to parents about their worry and tried to help them. What could be wrong with that? Of course, Wakefield was responsible for creating the worry in the first place. \nMcCarthy says she’s not an anti-vaxxer, she’s a pro-safe-vaxxer, but that term in itself keeps alive the belief that there’s something unsafe about the MMR vaccine that schools and hospitals offer. \nDr. Peter J. Hotez, a pediatrician who directs the vaccine development centre at Texas Children’s Hospital in Houston, says no one has ever shown a link between vaccine and autism. Yet his article in The New York Times two weeks ago carried a pessimistic headline, “How the Anti-Vaxxers Are Winning.” Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T11:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:08:38.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
