While Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green all made the team, it was Durant who stole the Warriors spotlight. \nWhile his game was a bit overshadowed thanks to hometown hero Anthony Davis tallying an All-Star Game record 52 points, what Durant did was nothing short of spectacular. His triple-double complete with 21 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds helped to place him in elite company as one of only four players to post a triple-double in the game. \nThat company? Well, it's right alongside three players who are almost certainly heading to the Hall of Fame (and one who's already in). \nVia SportsCenter's Twitter : \nDurant may not have won the MVP due to Davis' amazing performance, he certainly deserves some serious praise for joining that list above. He's now paired with Michael Jordan, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade as the only players to tally a triple-double in the game. \nIf you had asked most people before the game who had the best chance to accomplish the feat, the best guess probably would have been Russell Westbrook (who averages one for the season) or James Harden. \nTo make things even crazier, while Durant hit the triple-double, there were quite a few other players who came close in the game, including Memphis Grizzlies center Marc Gasol. Here are a few of the stat lines from Sunday night: James Harden 12 points, 12 assists, 7 rebounds Kyrie Irving 22 points, 14 assists, 7 rebounds Marc Gasol 10 points, 10 rebounds, 8 assists Topics: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:31:46.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
