This came during talks with a 15-member delegation from the Western Theatre Command (WTC) of the People's Liberation Army, led by Major-General Zhao Jin Song, which is on a five-day visit to India. It coincides with foreign secretary S Jaishankar's visit to Beijing for the bilateral strategic dialogue. As was earlier reported by TOI, the two militaries have been engaged in a series of discussions for the effective implementation of the 2013 bilateral border defence cooperation agreement (BDCA) as well as the proposed hotline between their top military commanders. As part of the bilateral CBMs, the two sides are also discussing additional BPM points in the Uttarakhand sector, which will add to the ones already existing at Daulat Beg Oldi and Chushul (Ladakh), Nathu La (Sikkim), Bum La and Kibithu (Arunachal). \"The two sides exchanged views on wide-ranging issues and agreed that peace and tranquillity on the border is an important guarantor for development and continued growth of bilateral relations,\" said an Army statement on Tuesday. With China recently re-organising its 2.3-million PLA into five strategic commands, the WTC now handles the entire LAC with India. Earlier, India was faced by the Chinese Chengdu Military Region in the east and the Lanzhou Military Region towards the north.
