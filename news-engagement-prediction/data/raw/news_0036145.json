Could   \nAn ISIS fighter captured by security forces has admitted killing hundreds of people and raping 'more than 200 women' in a sickening interview. \nThe militant, Ammar H, reportedly described how he moved from home to home in Iraq, raping terrified Yazidi women and other minorities. \nHe also told of how he slaughtered around 500 victims - either beheading them or putting a blindfold on them and firing a bullet into their skull. \nBut despite his horrific crimes, Ammar apparently has few regrets, claiming his actions were considered \"normal\" among the terror group's ranks. \n\"We shot whoever we needed to shoot and beheaded whoever we needed to beheaded,\" the militant, who was captured last October, told Reuters.

Thirty or 40 people. We would take them in desert and kill them,\" he claimed, according to AhlulBayt News Agency . \n\"I would sit them down, put a blindfold on them and fire a bullet into their heads.\" \nHe also reportedly told of how he raped hundreds of women, after being given permission by his emirs to attack as many as he wanted. \nMirror Online cannot independently verify Ammar's claims, but security officials say they have evidence the militant committed rapes and killings. \nAmmar spoke to Reuters from behind bars after being captured by Kurdish forces during an assault on Kirkuk, northern Iraq, four months ago.
