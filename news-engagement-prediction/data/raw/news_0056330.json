All seven roughly match the size and mass of our own planet and are almost certainly rocky , and three are perfectly perched to harbour life-nurturing oceans of water, they reported in the journal Nature . Most critically , their proximity to Earth and the dimness of their red dwarf star, called Trappist-1, will allow astronomers to parse each one's atmosphere in search of chemical signatures of biological activity. \"We have made a crucial step towards finding life out there,\" said co-author Amaury Triaud, a scientist at the University of Cambridge. \"Up to now, I don't think we have had the right planets to find out,\" he said in a press briefing . \"Now we have the right target .\" The Trappist-1 system, a mere 39 light years distant, has the largest number of Earth-sized planets known to orbit a single star. It also has the most within the so-called \"temperate zone\" – not so hot that water evaporates , nor so cold that it freezes rock-solid. The discovery adds to growing evidence that our home galaxy , the Milky Way, may be populated with tens of billions of worlds not unlike our own – far more than previously suspected . Remarkably, professional stargazers may simply have been looking in the wrong place. \"The great idea of this approach was to study planets around the smallest stars of the galaxy , and close to us,\" said lead author Michael Gillon, a professor at the University of Liege in Belgium. \"That is something nobody did before us – most astronomers were focused on stars like our Sun,\" he told journalists ahead of publication . Compared to the distance between our Sun and its planets , the Trappist-1 family is very tightly bunched . Indeed, the dwarf star and its seven satellites – with orbits ranging from 1.5 to 12 days – would all fit comfortably in the distance between the Sun and its closest planet , Mercury. If Earth were that close to the Sun, it would be a hellish ball of fire. But because Trappist-1 emits far less radiation , temperatures on its planets – depending on the atmosphere – could be between zero and 100 degrees Celsius , the scientists said. Gillon and his team have started to analyse the chemical make-up of the atmospheres . \"There is at least one combination of molecules , if present with relative abundance , that would tell us there is life, with 99 percent confidence ,\" said Gillon. A certain mix of methane , oxygen or ozone , and carbon dioxide, for example, could almost certainly come only from biological sources . \nThis artist’s impression released by the European Southern Observatory on February 22, 2017 shows the view just above the surface of one of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system.

Kornmesser/spaceengine.org\" \nSomeone standing on, say, Trappist-1 D, E or F – the three middle planets – would have a breathtaking panorama of the star and its system, Triaud said. The red dwarf – which would loom 10 times larger than the Sun in our sky – would be a \"deep crimson\" shading into a salmon-like colour, he said. \"The view would be beautiful – you would have about 200 times less light than from the Sun on Earth at midday,\" he added. \"It would be like the end of a sunset .\" Learn from listening \nClick \"play\" to listen to 7 Earth-like planets discovered orbiting a star and \"Download\" to keep this file for educational purpose.
