Hours before Frank's death, Malissa shared a post on Facebook about needing a new roommate; however, Police Chief William Dickey told the St. Louis Daily Journal that his wife wrote the post because her husband stated he was filing for a divorce. Washington County Sheriff Zach Jacobsen indicated that after Frank had disappeared, his 2015 black Ford Fusion was found by a U.S. Forest Service employee on Forest Service property near where the body was discovered. When authorities searched Ancona's home, his safe had been broken into and everything inside was removed, while several of his guns were missing as well. Jinkerson’s attorney, Eric Barnhart , maintains that \"he [doesn't] believe his client was involved in the killing.\" It remains unclear if Malissa currently has an attorney. Both are in jail, and being held without a bond. Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:53:22.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
