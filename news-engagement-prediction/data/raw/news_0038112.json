Remember when they teamed up with fellow Bundesliga side Bayern Munich to troll Manchester United and Arsenal? Well, they've come back for round 2. \nEuropean football took center stage this week with the Champions League hosting games on Tuesday and Wednesday, while the Europa League completed the European excursions on Thursday. \nWhich included United facing Saint-Etienne with the round of 32 game being billed as Pogba vs. Pogba. As Paul and Florentin came head-to-head for the first time. (The towering Swede takes home the match ball.) \nBut despite the brothers pitted against each other it was Zlatan Ibrahimovic who stole the headlines and will hog the spotlight following his Zlat-trick hat-trick. \nAnd once the first leg was completed, United took to Twitter to post a poll asking their followers to name Zlatan's trio of goals with 'Zlat-trick' and 'Threebrahimovic' the choices. What are we calling this? - Manchester United (@ManUtd) February 16, 2017 \nEveryone replied to the poll with the same response; 'Delete.' While someone brilliantly poked fun of United's Tweet by commenting; 'Deletahimovic.' \nNot to mention Bayer Leverkusen trolling United, again! . @ArsendWenger Hey don't tempt us... - Bayer 04 Leverkusen (@bayer04_en) February 16, 2017 \nFollowed by.. . @thomasjlangley @ArsendWenger we've got some #Bundesliga and #UCL matches coming up to keep us busy for now :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: - Bayer 04 Leverkusen (@bayer04_en) February 16, 2017 \nThe German's host Atletico Madrid next Tuesday. Meanwhile, the poll didn't go down well either:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:51:44.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
