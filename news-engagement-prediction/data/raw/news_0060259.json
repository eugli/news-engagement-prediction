Article continues below Jamie Carragher sums up Ranieri's sacking with scathing two-word tweet to Leicester \nAs a consequence, the former France star was fined £20,000, banned from playing for nine months and stripped of his captaincy for France while also losing his place in Les Bleus' team. \nBut despite the shocking incident which clearly left football fans stunned, the 50-year-old produced a rather surprising response to the incident during a recent Q&A with Manchester United supporters. Cantona reveals kung-fu-kick regret \nPer the Mirror , Cantona said: “I’ve said before I should have kicked him harder but maybe tomorrow I’ll say something else.\" \nThe Frenchman, as can be seen in the video below, clearly catches stewards, police and fans out by making a sudden charge towards one fan in particular before kicking him in the chest with both feet. \nBut the United star was not finished there and continued to throw a few punches before stewards and police managed to get him under control and calm him down before guiding him down the tunnel. \n“I cannot regret it. It was a great feeling. I learned from it — I think he (Simmons) learned too.\" Cantona added. \n“Nine months was a long time out and I struggled for a time but thanks to Ferguson we won the Double with a new generation.\" Passion problematic for Cantona \nIronically, given the incident back in 1995, Cantona has also claimed that the reason for deciding aged 30 was he had lost his \"passion\" for the game. Although, based on that afternoon at Selhurst Park two years prior, that appeared not to be the case. \nThe Frenchman's assault of one fan wasn't a freak incident, though. During his time at Auxerre in 1987 he gave his own team's goalkeeper a black eye while being suspended after kicking a ball into the crowd and throwing his shirt at the referee after being substituted by Marseille. \nHowever, despite some of the negative incidents surrounding Cantona's career, it was that passion that saw him become an iconic feature at one of the most iconic clubs in world football. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
