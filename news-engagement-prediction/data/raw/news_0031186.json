No wonder, he got the top role at Indian IT’s poster boy firm. \nIn his 32-month stint Sikka has changed many things in Infosys: he overhauled the organisational structure, increased the thrust on artificial intelligence and based on this laid down vision 2020. \nThe goal for 2020 is to achieve $20 billion ($8.7 billion currently) in revenue at 30 per cent net margin (23 per cent) and revenue per employee of $80,000 ($49,000). \nAll business decisions since June 2014, have been keeping this target in mind; the four acquisitions have also been executed to plug the gaps that were between the 2020 goal and Infosys. \nThe results were for all to see, within two years of Sikka taking over Infosys’ share price jumped 54% after some turbulence following worries of global protectionism and the recent controversy between its Board and founders, the IT company’s shares are still at a 22% spike over June 2014. \nSikka’s leadership has always been appreciated by Infosys’ investors. \nOppenheimer Developing Markets Fund, which holds a 2.13 per cent stake in the company and has been a long-term investor said: “We have been enormously pleased to see the stabilising hands of Vishal Sikka, who has improved underlying operating performance and begun to articulate a coherent strategy to a firm beset by a host of structural challenges to the ageing offshore IT service industry.” Read more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:34.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
