Grow, AFP/Getty Images) 4 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE California officials are trying to head off a disaster \nThe threat of devastating flooding downstream from California's Oroville Dam may get worse before it gets better. A pair of storms this week are expected to bring 2 to 6 inches of rain to Oroville, where the dam's concrete spillway has been crumbling and an adjacent emergency earthen spillway eroding. At least 188,000 residents began a chaotic evacuation of the area about 150 miles northwest of San Francisco on Sunday after officials feared a collapse of the emergency spillway could unleash a 30-foot wall of water. Forecasters anticipate a moderate storm Wednesday with a “really big and strong” storm Friday, which would put more pressure on the dam, already under strain from this winter's heavy rain and snow . Remember when California had a drought? CLOSE x Share Correction: An earlier version of this video misstated the location. California officials are working feverishly to relieve pressure to California's Oroville Dam to slow the water flow.

What does Beyonce have to do to win Album of the Year? \nBe white or maybe go more pop. While Beyoncé’s album Lemonade was one of the most critically acclaimed , evocative works of art in 2016, she didn’t win any of the major awards ( think song, record or album of the year) at the Grammys. That honor goes to Adele , who swept the awards. Cue furious fans of the Beyhive calling out the Grammys’ racial bias. There are several reasons why Queen Bey lost out. One of the biggest culprits is that the Grammys has an abysmal record of awarding black artists album of the year and tends to ghettoize black artists in the urban contemporary nomination. When Adele won album of the year, she took a moment to tell the crowd she actually wanted Beyonce to win: “My album of the year is Lemonade . I was completely rooting for her, voting for her .\" Props to Adele for an amazing display of sisterhood. Better luck next time Bey. \nOther tidbits from the Grammys you might have missed:   Adele accepts the award for Album of the Year during the 59th Annual Grammy Awards Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY NETWORK Adele reacts on stage after she breaks the Grammy trophy she received for Album of the Year.
