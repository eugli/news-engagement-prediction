The plunge in the pound, which gathered pace after Britons voted in June to leave the EU, has left the pound at a 30-year low against the dollar.\nRoughly 1.5 million North American tourists visited Britain during the third quarter of 2016, Reuters reported, up more than 10 percent from the same quarter during the prior year.
