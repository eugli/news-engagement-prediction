Rahman, who ran a recruitment firm which supplied addresses and fake jobs for the benefits cheats, has been ordered to repay £66,344 and £10,000 in costs. While the fraudsters claim they cannot pay back what they owe, Muyeed and his wife owned a substantial home in Manor Park, east London, which they sold some months before their trial for a knock-down price of £275,000. Muyeed (pictured) has now been ordered to repay £204,595.64, while his wife was told to cough up £228,444.53 The property, with four bedrooms and three reception rooms, is currently valued at £490,000. It is believed Rahman has been freed and he is now understood to live in a property in Mile End, also east London. The three-bedroom home was bought by Rahman in May 2008 for £249,999, but is now worth around £393,000. During the gang’s trial last year, Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London heard how the couple set up two charities – Families for Survival UK and Save the Age – using them as fronts for the scam. Two London boroughs, Redbridge and Tower Hamlets, lost at least £1.6million between them through fake housing benefit and council tax credit claims. The Department for Work and Pensions also lost £420,000 from bogus tax credit claims. Much of the cash was paid straight into Muyeed’s accounts. The Bangladesh-born accountant was head of finance at Blood Pressure UK, a genuine charity, while he was carrying out the fraud.
