Authorities revealed her death Tuesday. \nRichard \"Kwasi\" Springer, 29, has been charged in the case and was previously ordered to undergo a mental health exam. \nSpringer has already been charged with first-degree robbery and second-degree assault, but those charges are likely to be upgraded to murder as the medical examiner ruled Gentillon died of blunt force trauma as a result of his punch. \nSpringer is currently being held in an upstate New York psych facility, according to authorities. He returns to court March 3. \nBack in October, Gentillon was walking down a Queens sidewalk when the suspect, identified by cops as Springer, came barreling out of the Sutphin King Deli at about 8 a.m. \nSpringer had stumbled into the store looking to buy a $3.50 Bud Light Straw-Ber-Rita, but only had $1, store clerk Methaq Algabyali told InsideEdition.com. \n“He wanted to take the beer,” he said. \nAs Springer fought with Algabyali over the alcohol, the victim told him to stop, he said. Springer instead charged at the unsuspecting woman and slugged her in the face, knocking her unconscious, cops said. “He punched the lady for no reason ,” Algabyali, 18, said. “He wanted to fight.” Gentillon was rushed to Jamaica Hospital, where sources said she suffered a brain hemorrhage. “When I saw her, I think she died,” Algabyali said, adding that he thought what Springer did was stupid . Springer, who lived about three blocks away from the deli, has caused trouble in the store before, but never to this extent, Algabyali said. “He’s a regular customer here,” he said. “Sometimes when he drink(s), he causes problems.” Share Share on Facebook Tweet Share on Twitter Receive Breaking News By signing up, you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy Your e-mail was submitted successfully.
