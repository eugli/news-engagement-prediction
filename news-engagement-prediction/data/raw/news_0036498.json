We are so excited to see kids because they are the future and to see them interacting with the community is great.” \nThe event opened with a short and brief presentation about the origins, beliefs, practices and culture of Islam. It also included demonstrations of several prayers, followed by a question and answer session. \n“There are no bad questions,” Malki said jokingly. “You all came here with questions and to show support.” \nSome people asked about the differences in how Islam is practiced between varying cultures and different parts of the world. Other wanted to know more about attire and how to appropriately support their Muslim neighbors. Daniel Brenner, Special to the Denver Post Melissa Alkassir, from right, and Amatullah Malki, 16, listens with a large audience to a presentation explaining Muslim customs, beliefs, and misconceptions during an open house Saturday, Feb. 18, 2017 at the Denver Islamic Society. \nAyah Sasi agreed with Malki that there were no stupid questions when trying to learn about her culture and religion. \n“It feels good that people are taking an interest and want to know more,” she said. “You can tell when somebody is being genuinely curious and when they’re being offensive, especially in their tone of voice.” Related Articles ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:30:16.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
