Plus, yes, he finished the drive with a beautiful layup. A post shared by Juan Quinones (@jquinonesjr63) on Feb 21, 2017 at 8:14pm PST \nGurley got a late start to his rookie season two years ago after tearing his ACL in college, so Rams fans probably just want him to be careful out there. He ended up rushing for 1,106 yards in 13 games during his first season and dropped off to 885 yards in 2016. \nNFL defenders might not be quite as easy to deke as Joe 24 Hour Fitness, but don’t be surprised if Gurley has a big third season.
