It has flourished despite invasion, conflict and an almost complete lack of natural resources, other than the determination and genius of its people.\" Welcome to Australia Bibi & Sara! @netanyahu pic.twitter.com/ZoL8JqSzmb — Malcolm Turnbull (@TurnbullMalcolm) February 22, 2017 And in a nod to the recent United Nations Security Council resolution, Turnball writes, \"My government will not support one-sided resolutions criticising Israel of the kind recently adopted by the UN Security Council and we deplore the boycott campaigns designed to delegitimise the Jewish state.\" He adds, \"At the same time, we recognise that Israel and the Palestinians need to come to a settlement and we support a directly negotiated two-state solution so that Palestinians will have their own state and the people of Israel can be secure within agreed borders.\" Netanyahu -- who aside from Turnball, met with Australian Governor-General Peter Cosgrove -- welcomed the comments made by Turnball in his op-ed, telling reporters in Sydney, \"I wasn't surprised by the friendship expressed in the article but I had no advance warning so when I landed I was given the paper, I was delighted to read it ...
