It was so emotional seeing Noma ’s performance in a way that I had not anticipated at all. I went to the play…and she walked in the room and I just spontaneously burst into tears,” she explained to EW . \nEmma added, “I had played that character so intensely up until that point, that to know that Hermione was going to be okay — I know it sounds crazy — but to know that everything turned out all right and everything in the world was okay, that there was someone else carrying her on and carrying her forward…it was just such a relief.” \nPictured inside: Emma making her way through a Eurostar station on Tuesday (February 21) in London, England.
