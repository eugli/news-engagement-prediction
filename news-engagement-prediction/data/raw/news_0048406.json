While no one was reportedly hurt or injured, 11 centers had to be evacuated on President's Day, bringing the total threats against Jewish community centers this year to at least 69 at 54 centers in 27 states, the New York Daily News reported .\nIn a separate incident last week, more than 100 headstones were vandalized at the Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery, a Jewish cemetery, in University City, Mo., Fox affiliate KTVI reported on Monday.\nThe tombstones that were vandalized were located in an older section of the cemetery, much of which pre-dates 1960.\n\"These are holocaust survivors that are in here.
