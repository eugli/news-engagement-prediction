But the key to its effectiveness will lie not just in its legal drafting but will depend to a very large extent on whether the Government allocates sufficient financial resources to councils to meet the demand for homelessness services.\nBut what exactly is ‘sufficient’? And who are the homeless that will be supported?\nIt all comes down to who is ‘counted’ as being homeless . If a young person is homeless and no-one sees them, are they homeless? If a young person asks for help and no-one listens; were they there? If they seek help but are simply turned away; do they count? This may sound like pub philosophising but this a problem faced by real people.\nRead more Young people facing homelessness are 'turned away' when they seek help Take Sarah. Kicked out by her parents, she has stitched together a life from the age of 16 to the age of 19; sofa surfing, favours and a shaky future. Does she count? Or Steve, 21; council staff turned him away as he has no kids, no formal application made. Is he counted? What about Jack, 16 – a child - anger issues. Mum can’t let him come home as he has younger siblings; he’s now rough sleeping in a park. Social services think mum should intervene; she does not feel she can, wouldn’t be safe or fair for her other children. Counted?\nIn all these circumstances the answer is no. They would not be counted and they will not show up on official statistics. Because current legislation allows you to be simultaneously homeless but not ‘homeless’, every year thousands of young people who have nowhere to go cannot access support.\nBut the impact goes further than just whether one individual can get the support they need. In an age of ever-smaller public sector budgets, data has become more and more crucial in deciding where and how the Government spends taxpayer’s money.\nThe causes of homelessness 7 show all The causes of homelessness 1/7 Family Breakdown Relationship breakdown, usually between young people and their parents or step-parents, is a major cause of youth homelessness. Around six in ten young people who come to Centrepoint say they had to leave home because of arguments, relationship breakdown or being told to leave. Many have experienced long-term problems at home, often involving violence, leaving them without the family support networks that most of us take for granted\n2/7 Complex needs Young people who come to Centrepoint face a range of different and complex problems. More than a third have a mental health issue, such as depression and anxiety, another third need to tackle issues with substance misuse. A similar proportion also need to improve their physical health. These problems often overlap, making it more difficult for young people to access help and increasing the chances of them becoming homeless\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n3/7 Deprivation Young people's chances of having to leave home are higher in areas of high deprivation and poor prospects for employment and education. Many of those who experience long spells of poverty can get into problem debt, which makes it harder for them to access housing\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n4/7 Gang Crime Homeless young people are often affected by gang-related problems. In some cases, it becomes too dangerous to stay in their local area meaning they can end up homeless. One in six young people at Centrepoint have been involved in or affected by gang crime\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n5/7 Exclusion From School Not being in education can make it much more difficult for young people to access help with problems at home or health problems. Missing out on formal education can also make it more difficult for them to move into work\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n6/7 Leaving Care Almost a quarter of young people at Centrepoint have been in care. They often have little choice but to deal with the challenges and responsibilities of living independently at a young age. Traumas faced in their early lives make care leavers some of the most vulnerable young people in our communities, with higher chances of poor outcomes in education, employment and housing. Their additional needs mean they require a higher level of support to maintain their accommodation\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\n7/7 Refugees Around 13 per cent of young people at Centrepoint are refugees or have leave to remain, meaning it isn't safe to return home. This includes young people who come to the UK as unaccompanied minors, fleeing violence or persecution in their own country. After being granted asylum, young people sometimes find themselves with nowhere to go and can end up homeless\nGetty Images/iStockphoto\nLast year across the UK, 26,000 young people were seen as being officially ‘homeless’ but according to Freedom of Information returns received from local authorities, an estimated 150,000 asked their local authority for help. At least one third were turned away with no help at all. A figure which could rise even higher if the Government moves forwards with plans from April to restrict the ability of thousands of 18 to 21-year-olds to claim benefits to keep a roof over their heads.\nIf you are the Chancellor of the Exchequer you might look at the official data and decide the Government only needs to fund support for 26,000 people, and you wouldn’t be entirely wrong. Under the official definition of homelessness, money allocated on this basis should meet demand.\nIf you are local councils you would look at your official data and decide you need from the Government enough money to meet demand from 150,000 young people, and they wouldn’t be entirely wrong either.\nThe fact is that nobody actually knows for certain the precise number of young people who need help because they are homeless, something which the cross-party Communities and Local Government select committee of MPs pointed out last year. That is why Centrepoint created the Youth Homelessness Databank to better collect and analyse youth homelessness data.\nBut it really shouldn’t fall to a charity to have to step in to ensure that the scale of homelessness is properly monitored. If the Government is serious about tackling homelessness it needs to get serious about the way it collects data.\nGaia Marcus is Centrepoint's Youth Homelessness Databank Manager", "external_links": ["https://www.yhdatabank.com/"], "published": "2017-02-10T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T10:59:36.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
