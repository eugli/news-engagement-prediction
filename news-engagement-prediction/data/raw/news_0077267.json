General Motors in its heyday employed more than 600,000 workers in the United States, including the engineer, the man sweeping the shop floor and the woman serving coffee. Though the engineer certainly earned much more, the other two could share in G.M.’s success. Norms of fairness, Mr. Weil argues, would limit the wage gap between workers of a single company, giving a boost to those at the bottom. Outsourcing does away with such considerations. Apple is as successful as G.M. was in its time. But it employs fewer than 70,000 people in the United States. While it keeps engineers, designers and such in house, it doesn’t bother with workers not critical to creating seductive new gadgets. Many of those work for Foxconn , in Asia, where the margins are slimmer and the pay is not as good. \n  The trend is not unique to manufacturing nor to outsourcing overseas, though. It is happening across the nation’s brick-and-mortar workplaces and coursing through service industries, the fastest-growing segment of the labor market. These days the receptionist at the front desk is unlikely to work for the hotel. The truck driver may not work for the delivery company, nor the nurse for the hospital . Jobs in coal mining and hydraulic fracturing — even shipbuilding — have been siphoned off. Though the gig economy is still small — employing 0.5 percent of contingent workers, according to Professors Katz and Krueger — the technologies powering it are likely to fissure the American workplace further. This sorting would increase the slice of national income going to shareholders and reduce workers’ share. The pattern is consistent with evidence that most of the widening of the nation’s earnings inequality can be explained by growing pay gaps between organizations rather than within them. \nAdvertisement Over all, Professor Katz estimates, the sorting of workers into high- and low-end employers accounts for a quarter to a third of the increase of wage inequality in the United States since 1980. \nAdvertisement So can Mr. Trump do anything about this? When at the Labor Department, Mr. Weil argued that companies that outsource should share liability with subcontractors for wages and working conditions, so they could not simply wash their hands of responsibility. \n  It’s not an easy problem to fix, though. As Mr. Weil puts it, “How do you reattach some of the responsibility to the engine of value of these network business systems?” Companies will continue to seek efficiencies by shunting work into these broader networks. And it would make little sense to adopt policies that forbid this kind of business organization. Encouraging unions, which many scholars have suggested as a tool to improve wage growth, could well accelerate the splintering. And yet, there may be a place for incentives to discourage the weakening of labor standards. Some employers might adopt a system like Harvard’s parity policy to ensure that those in contract positions like guards or cafeteria workers get the same pay and benefits as comparable university staff members. Whatever its difficulties, addressing the vast transformation underway in the organization of work seems more relevant than tilting at windmills in hopes of restoring American manufacturing to its 1950s state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:49:47.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
