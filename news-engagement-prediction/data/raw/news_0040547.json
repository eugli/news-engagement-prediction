Doing ourselves justice, for every trial and tribulation we have been through these past years\", writes Lauren.\nBut their final idea is incredibly powerful and perfectly highlights the trials, struggles and heartbreak that can come with not being able to conceive naturally.\nThe couple's post on Facebook (Photo: Facebook) The photo shows two adorable baby grows surrounded by all the needles and medication that made their dreams of becoming parents a reality.\nHave you revealed your pregnancy in an unusual way? Share your story below.\nAlongside the photo Lauren has penned an extremely honest account of what the couple have been through.\nShe also admits it was not easy to take the photo.\nShe writes: \"Taking out these needles by the handful to take this photograph was... surreal.\n\"Half way through my hands started to quiver, my breath got short, and I had to stop. I sat down, looked at it and started to cry.\n\"Not because I was sad about what it took to get here, but because it was a representation of my world, our world, for the past over two and a half years staring back at me.\n\"There was a lot of pain, hope, and fear behind each of these needles. Each one represents a different day, a different path, a different emotion. It's a lot to take in.\n\"After a good cry, the more I looked at it, the more the needles started to blur together.\n\"Now all I see are these tiny onesies that so perfectly sum up our journey: Worth the wait. And wait, and wait, and wait.\"\nLittle Duke and Diana Walker are due in August - and Lauren and Garyt couldn't be more excited.\n\"Mommy and Daddy cannot wait to hold you in our arms, for we have carried you in our hearts for a lifetime.\"\n Comments Show more comments More On Pregnancy IVF Parenting Babies Giving birth", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=DailyMirror"], "published": "2017-02-16T17:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T17:45:40.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
