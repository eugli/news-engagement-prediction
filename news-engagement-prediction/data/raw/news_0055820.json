During my last three seasons I kept hearing 'Dani Alves is leaving', but the directors never said anything.\"They were very false and ungrateful, they didn't respect me. They only offered me a renewal when they got the FIFA sanctions. \n\"That's why I played them at their own game and signed a renewal with a release clause. Those who run Barcelona today have no idea how to treat their players.\" \nDuring his recent interview, Alves was also asked about Real Madrid skipper Sergio Ramos. The Spaniard was not only met with boos and jeers when he returned to the Ramรณn Sรกnchez Pizjuรกn Stadium last month to play against boyhood club Sevilla in the 3-3 Copa Del Rey draw, he also claimed to be on the end of insults and chants about his mother and gestured to the fans when he scored in the 83rd minute. \nAnd though Alves says he did not agree with the level of abuse his former teammate was on the receiving end of in the game, he says with the way his career with the Andalusian club ended, it's no surprise. \nHe said: \n\"I think it's totally wrong that Ramos is subjected to insults, but at the same time he may not be in a position to make these demands from the fans regarding respect. \n\"Ramos to be frank didn't achieve that much at Sevilla to not celebrate goals or to ask for forgiveness when scoring. I was there for six years and won plenty of titles. \n\"Just a few days before moving to Real Madrid, Ramos declared eternal love for Sevilla and that is the root problem of the anger that the fans hold towards Ramos. He's still hostage to those words.\" \nWhat do you make of Alves' latest comments?
