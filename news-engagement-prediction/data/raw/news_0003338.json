Instead of collecting clothes, games, gift cards and money, the little animal lover has asked her family and friends to donate to the Bow Wow Buddies Foundation .\nCourtesy Okel Family The Bow Wow Buddies Foundation is part of Camp Bow Wow , and is a non-profit dedicated to covering the urgent medical expenses of shelter dogs and pups who belong to families who can’t afford to pay their pet’s bills. Through the Bow Wow Buddies Foundation and donors like Hannah, the non-profit can offer up to $2,500 to families, shelters and rescue groups who need help saving a dog’s life.\nFor Hannah, a proud pet parent to her dog Scout, this is a charity that makes a lot of sense.\n“I chose this because if Scout needed surgery and we didn’t have enough money to pay for it, I would be sad. So, I am putting my feet in other people’s shoes and want to help those who can’t pay for their animal’s surgery,” Hannah said.\nCourtesy Okel Family\nUntil Feb. 18, Hannah’s 10th birthday, the aspiring vet will be collecting donations, which will be matched by Camp Bow Wow Waukesha.\nShould you wish to share this special cause with your readers or send Hannah a birthday wish, you can make a donation here , and write “Hannah’s Birthday – CBW Waukesha” in the special note section.\nShow Full Article", "external_links": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/okel-family-1.jpg?w=2000", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/okel-family-3.jpg?w=2000", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/okel-family-3.jpg?w=2000&#038;h=1239", "http://www.bowwowbuddies.com/", "http://www.bowwowbuddies.com/donate", "http://www.campbowwow.com/", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/okel-family-1.jpg?w=2000&#038;h=1375"], "published": "2017-02-01T22:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:05:24.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
