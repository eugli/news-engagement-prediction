Sixers center Jahlil Okafor (Getty Imges) \nUpdated at 5:39 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 5:39 p.m. ET \nPhiladelphia 76ers center Jahlil Okafor may be shipped to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for a first round pick, per reports. New Orleans may also send reserve center Alexis Ajinca to Philly, according to The Undefeated's Marc Spears . \nThe deal is in \"advanced talks,\" according to ESPN's Marc Stein , and if the pieces stand as we know it, this move could make sense for both parties. The holdup appears to be on the protections placed on the pick. Stein reported that the most recent talks have the Pelicans sending a future first-rounder. New Orleans has also attempted to include Omer Asik in the deal, according to the Vertical's Adrian Wojnarowski, but Philly declined. \nIt's been no secret that Philadelphia has been shopping Okafor, who has lost his place in the rotation behind a star in rookie Joel Embiid and another talented big in Nerlens Noel. Okafor is developing much slower and has red flags on the defensive end. Still, at 21 years old, Okafor has time to improve, and the Sixers have been searching without luck for a first-round pick in return for their 2015 No. 3 pick. Assuming the protections aren't extreme, this could be a worthwhile deal for the Sixers, who don't have much leverage in any Okafor deal. \nFor the Pelicans, dealing the rest of Ajinca's two-year, $10 million deal would help to free cap space and remove who Spears called an \"unhappy\" center from New Orleans. The Pelicans have also reportedly been in pursuit of a center like Brook Lopez to pair next to Anthony Davis, according to Wojnarowski , but this may be the more financially sound route. The team is taking a chance in bringing on an unproven talent with an undetermined NBA worth, but must believe he can thrive with Davis. \nThe NBA trade deadline is on February 23.
