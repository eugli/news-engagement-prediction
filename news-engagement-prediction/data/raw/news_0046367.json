The U2 frontman and the vice president were both in Germany for the Munich Security Conference, where they were scheduled to speak individually. Bono thanked Pence for backing the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in 2003, when Pence was a congressman from Indiana. He also referred to Pence as “the second busiest man in America.” Watch a video from their meeting below. \nDuring Bono’s speech on Friday at the conference, the Irish musician argued for investing in developing nations, saying, “I don't see a body of water wide enough, or a wall high enough, to keep these problems from our doors... The frontier of national interest is no longer the national border.” Check out a clip from that speech below as well.
