With a distinctive forefoot strap, anchored by Flywire cable loops, the simple silhouette packs a highly functional punch. Under the forefoot, a Zoom Air unit delivers low-profile, responsive cushioning, while a number of signature details add a personal touch. \nHardman and George’s connection is evident in the nuances of the PG1’s design. Here are 10 of things you might not notice at first glance: 1. Crusader Crush \nThe Nike Zoom Crusader was George’s favorite basketball shoe until the PG1. Ironically, Hardman designed the Crusader and the snug, seamless fit is reflected in the PG1 design. Share Image 2. The strap began with a sketch \nThe PG1 forefoot strap came directly from George, who showed Hardman a sketch of his dream shoe during one of their initial meetings. 3. Janoski Inspiration \nElements of George’s favored casual shoe, the Nike SB Janoski, inspired materials and construction subtleties of the PG1. 4. Traction at Scale \nThe shoe’s traction pattern, which resembles fish scales, reflects George’s love for fishing — a pastime he shares with his father, Paul George Sr. Share Image 5. Personal growth \nThree small graphic details on the shoe share personal details about George. The medial side of the left shoe is inscribed with “5-1-15,” honoring the first birthday of George’s daughter, Olivia, on his first shoe. His birthday, “5-2-90,” appears on the medial left side. The right heel tab features a stripe — a reminder of the titanium rod used to repair George’s devastating right-leg fracture. Share Image 6. Family First \nFamily ties are also evident in the shoe's color choices. The PG1 Obsidian colorway injects a nod to his mother, Paulette, with hits of purple on the heel tab and eyelets, and blend with George’s team colors obsidian blue and yellow. Share Image 7. Sophisticated Simplicity \nOn the tongue, the PG logo locks George’s initials into a bowtie — a reminder of his unique blend of simplicity and sophistication. Need more evidence? George drives a Ferrari, but keeps a fishing rod in the backseat in case he spots a place to fish. Share Image 8. Finishing Touch \nTake note of the materials. From hairy suede to scaled leather, Hardman and George made sure each colorway comes complete with a unique (and high quality) feel. 9. Rated PG13 Share Image 10. Clouds for your Feet \nThe PG1 box is adorned with clouds. Why? George’s early ask to Hardman was to design “clouds on his feet.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:57:27.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
