Adrija Bose Social Media Editor NEW! HIGHLIGHT AND SHARE   Miley Cyrus/Instagram ADVERTISEMENT \nWhile most of America was glued to Super Bowl 51 on the television, Miley Cyrus chose to do something completely different. The singer performed a 'Lakshmi puja' at her home in Malibu on Sunday. \nThe 24-year-old singer posted a picture on Instagram, which shows a traditional Hindu prayer set-up with the Goddess of Wealth being worshipped. An offering of fruits and halwa sits next to the goddess. \n\"#FruitBowl over Super... #offering,\" she captioned it. A photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Feb 5, 2017 at 8:01pm PST \nAnother Instagram post shows a room with cushions arranged on floor mats, and flower petals scattered around. There are candles in glass jars dotting around the room. Cyrus captioned the photograph, 'Puja'.

Among her many tattoos — and 'the wrecking ball' star has several — many have Hindu associations. She has the word 'karma' inked on her finger and the 'Om' symbol inked on the inside of her left wrist.
