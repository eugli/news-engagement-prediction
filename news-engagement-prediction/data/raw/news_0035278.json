Malayalam actress… SHOCKING! Malayalam actress Bhavana abducted and molested in her own car in Kochi Popular Malayalam actress Bhavana, known for her roles in Honey Bee and CID Moosa, was abducted and later molested in her own car by a group of unidentified people. By Sreeju Sudhakaran | Published: February 18, 2017 11:22 am Babe of the week: Bhavana \nFor those people who thought it’s always the ordinary people who are targeted by the nefarious elements in our society like eve teasers and molesters, this incident will come as a rude shock for you. Popular Malayalam actress Bhavana , known for her roles in Honey Bee and CID Moosa, was abducted and later molested in her own car by a group of unidentified people. This happened last night in Kochi where she resides. \nAs per reports, this group of miscreants stopped Bhavana’s car near Angamaly, and forcibly made their way into it. They reportedly molested the actress till the vehicle reached Palarivattom, which is around a 45 minutes drive. Once they reached there, they made their exit through another car making the entire setup look like a planned exercise. Bhavana is said to have taken refuge in a friend and film director’s house near Kakkannad, who informed the police. Once the police got the information, they came in to his place and took statements from the actress, before looking to catch the culprits. Bhavana has accused her former driver of being the part of the gang, whom the police have taken into custody. According to Manorama News, Sunil Kumar AKA Pulsar Suni is the main culprit in this case. \nBhavana had made her debut in Malayalam cinema with Nammal in 2002. Though it was just a supporting role, she got critical acclaim for her performance as the slum dweller in the Kamal movie, and she got offers to be the lead actress in movies like CID Moosa, Swapnakoodu, Chronic Bachelor, Naran, Chess, etc. She also made a moderately successful transition into Tamil cinema with movies like Chithiram Pesuthadi, Deepavali, Aasal. She was also a part of few Kannada movies as well. Her last movie in Malayalam was Kuttikalundu Sookshikkuka . She was currently shooting for the sequel to Honey Bee. \nBollywoodLife condemns this dastardly act and we are hoping the police will bring the miscreants to justice soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T12:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:36:06.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
