On paper, it was a mind-blowing performance that Ball had dedicated to a young girl in need of a heart transplant. But when it came to the footage of Ball's epic game, Ball's defense (or lack thereof) stood out. \nAs he scored 41 points in the fourth quarter, Ball didn't go back on defense. He scored 60 points off 2-point field goals - many of which were cherry-picked layups. The video of how Ball played, receiving outlet passes without crossing midcourt quickly went viral. This is so lame haha pic.twitter.com/iEcrl1opDJ — NBA All Access (@nballaccess) February 8, 2017 \nThe highlights opened Ball up to criticism all over the basketball world and Twitter - even from Charles Barkley . To many, it made the 92-point performance less impressive. The LaMelo Ball game last night was disgraceful to basketball. I haven't seen that much cherry picking at the local rec center. — Steve Layman (@SteveLayman) February 8, 2017 #Hottake : LaMelo Ball is really good, but that 92-point game was not impressive. That looked like an annoying rec game w/ no defense. — Ben Baby (@Ben_Baby) February 8, 2017 when LaMelo Ball actually has to start playing defense pic.twitter.com/PjSlNfD2PY — Petey Louise (@PeteyLouise) February 8, 2017 LaMelo Ball scored 92 off cherry picking and layups. Never crossed half court to play D. What are you teaching this kid? Awful basketball. — Clif Conley (@ClifConley_14) February 8, 2017 Congrats on scoring 92 points, Lamelo Ball. Maybe next time cross halfcourt. pic.twitter.com/cFiwd37EmQ — Not Jerry Tipton (@NotJerryTipton) February 8, 2017 Lamelo Ball scored 92 and didnt even cross halfcourt to play defense... James Harden couldnt be more proud — Eliot Van Grunsven (@elivangrunsven) February 8, 2017 \nHis high school coach Stephan Gilling certainly saw the lack of defense, but he wasn't going to stop what seemed to be working. He said via the Los Angeles Times : \n\"As a coach, if I see a player doing well, who am I to stop his shine?\" \nAnd to be fair, the Los Osos coach Dave Smith didn't exactly adjust to defend the cherry picking as Ball caught many of those outlet passes to set up wide-open layups. At one point, Ball chilled around halfcourt to stretch before scoring on an open layup. Even when Los Osos tried to adjust, Ball still found a way to get his points. \nIs Ball going to have to play defense eventually? Yes. Is it still cool that he scored 92 points? Still yes.
