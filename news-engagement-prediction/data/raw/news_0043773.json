We will watch him in training and decide after that,\" Argentine Simeone told reporters on the eve of the match.

He's really hit the ground running after the [season] break,\" Schmidt said at a prematch news conference. \n\"He's working very hard for the team and is doing a great job of sticking away the chances that come his way. \n\"In games like this, it's very important to have a player who can stick the ball in the back of the net.\" \nDiego Simeone: \n\"We have played many games in the Champions League in the last couple of years, but tomorrow is all that counts,\" said Simeone, whose side lost 1-0 at Leverkusen two years ago before advancing on penalties in the return leg at the same stage. \n\"We are playing against a side with great intensity, but we have great intensity too. Passion is very important in football, so I am curious to see how it will play out tomorrow.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:31:35.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
