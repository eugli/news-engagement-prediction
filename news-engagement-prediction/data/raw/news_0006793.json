I think you’re going to be very, very excited.\nBy Sunday – amid ongoing protests against the travel ban on visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries and a block on refugees – he had apparently made up his mind:\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) I have made my decision on who I will nominate for The United States Supreme Court. It will be announced live on Tuesday at 8:00 P.M.

Garland did not become a supreme court judge .\nBut tonight’s announcement takes the circus to a new level: both presumed finalists – though let’s not assume there is no Trump joker card waiting to be played – have reportedly been summoned to the White House for a live broadcast announcement at 8pm ET, during which the president will tell one of the pair that he is hired.\nIt is not clear whether Neil Gorsuch and Thomas Hardiman, judges in Colorado and Pennsylvania respectively, themselves know who is to be handed the prize. Perhaps they will find out with the rest of us – though leaked reports suggest Gorsuch is the frontrunner.\nWe’ll have everything here on the live blog as it unfolds.\nUpdated at 12.12am GMT \nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:33:34.604+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
