So it's $33 for me in both parks, if you're an Argentinian it's half that and if you're from that province it's $4,\" he said. KIRK HARGREAVES/FAIRFAX NZ \nDepartment of Conservation (DoC) director general Lou Sanson said he would prefer to see park users charged for services such as huts rather than access. \nHe suggested introducing entry charges for four popular parks - Milford, Fox, Franz and Aoraki. Others, with multiple access points, could be difficult to charge for, he noted. Ad Feedback \nHowever, he would prefer to see park users charged for services such as huts rather than access. \nKiwis would pay far less than international tourists, he suggested, saying a hut in Routeburn might cost locals $50 and foreigners twice that. \nDoC huts currently cost up to $54. \nAnother option could be to introduce charges for services like buses which transport people to and from the park and parking. \nIn December, tramping group Federated Mountain Clubs hit out at the possibility that tourists could be forced to pay more to experience the country's Great Walks. \nConservation Minister Maggie Barry had conceded the costs of servicing remote huts and keeping them \"up to standard has become a challenge\". \n\"It's almost certainly going to be inefficient, very difficult and intrusive to [New Zealand's] welcoming culture,\" vice-president Jan Finlayson said. \nWhat do you think?
