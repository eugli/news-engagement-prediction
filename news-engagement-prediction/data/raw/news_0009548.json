"English football’s crazy finances are such that even Middlesbrough’s new £6million striker Patrick Bamford, who has not scored a goal for almost two years, could make grand demands when sent out on loan by Chelsea to Norwich, Crystal Palace and Burnley.\nAll three clubs had to match his Chelsea wages of £40,000 a week, as well as fix up a free apartment for the goal-shy Bamford, pay his utility bills and organise a TV and broadband package with Sky Sports and movies.\nFree housing, gas and electricity are normal perks for players sent out on loan from Premier League clubs, but it is unusual to have their TV subscriptions and internet covered too.\nPatrick Bamford demanded his loan clubs arrange a free apartment for him and pay his bills\nThe striker joined Middlesbrough after playing on loan at Crystal Palace, Norwich and Burnley\nBamford never made a first team appearance for Chelsea despite spending years there\nIt is understood that Bamford’s father was insistent on those demands being met.\nForeign owners such as Massimo Cellino of Leeds believe loan signings can well afford to pay for their own accommodation, let alone their Sky viewing.\nEngland Twenty20 specialist Tymal Mills hoped he would make a big enough impression in the three-match series against India to put him in the shop window for the Indian Premier League.\nAnd the 90mph bowler appears to have done just that, with several IPL teams, including Kolkata, chasing a player who has to concentrate on T20 because a back condition restricts him to four express overs.\nThere is upset among some Sutton fans that the draw for the FA Cup sixth round will be staged on the Sunday after Blackburn v Manchester United — more than 24 hours before the non-Leaguers face Arsenal.\nThe fans’ grouse is that the timing deprives them of the glorious uncertainty of what happens next during the build-up to the biggest game in their club’s history.\nBT Sport, who set the time for the draw, say Sunday evening has been a regular slot for the draw in recent seasons, even when there is a Monday evening match.\nSutton fans are disappointed the FA Cup quarter-final draw will take place before their clash\nSutton will face Arsenal in the fifth round after previously knocking out league side Leeds\nIt was noticeable at the funeral of Graham Taylor this week that there was no official top-brass representation from Aston Villa, whom he managed with such distinction.\nThere were plenty of former Villa players and staff in attendance, plus the six current personnel from Taylor’s time, but nobody from Villa’s executive.\nA spokesman said the owner was abroad, the chief executive didn’t know Taylor and the company secretary, who was keen to go, was caught up in the transfer deadline-day aftermath. Villa have also invited Taylor’s family to a match.\nEDDIE READY FOR 2019\nEddie Jones’s attention to detail saw the England rugby squad change hotels on Thursday from their Pennyhill Park base to Syon House near Twickenham a day earlier than usual.\nThis is to prepare the squad — who face France in the Six Nations on Saturday — for hotel hopping at the World Cup in Japan in 2019.\nBut Jones’s micro-management doesn’t extend to the music the RFU will play after every England try. The man in charge of the playlist will be choosing English rock classics. But Jones, who wouldn’t be drawn on whether he approved of music to rev up the atmosphere, pronounced: ‘They can play YMCA for all I care.’\nMeanwhile, despite the England team being expected to have by far the most representatives in the Lions squad this summer, head coach Warren Gatland has chosen to attend the two other Six Nations matches this weekend.\nEddie Jones changed England's team hotel as they prepare to face France on Saturday\nSouth African football chief Danny Jordaan, who led the bid and organisation of the 2010 World Cup, has chosen not to leave his home country since the FIFA-related arrests in Zurich in May 2015.\nNevertheless, Jordaan has emerged as a candidate for African representation on the FIFA Council and says he will travel to meetings.\nTeam GB’s record-breaking exploits at the Rio Olympics have hardly led to a sponsorship bonanza for the medal winners.\nOne of the few notable deals involves triathlon heroes the Brownlee brothers, who signed up with Aldi on Thursday, while swimmer Adam Peaty and hockey captain Kate Richardson-Walsh have become the faces of Quorn, replacing Mo Farah after his contract expired.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-03T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:54:39.493+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
