Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nYears ago, when Bob Barker would talk about neutering and spaying at the end of The Price is Right, he meant your PETS, people. \nJulie Bowen, known as Claire Dunphy from Modern Family, made a guest appearance on The Price is Right to raise money for â€¦ Planned Parenthood. \nâ€” The Price Is Right (@PriceIsRight) February 23, 2017 \nThe fundraiser wasnâ€™t exactly met with the most positive and supportive of reviews: @PriceIsRight @itsJulieBowen Further proof, PPH doesn't need tax $$. This is absolutely disgusting. Abortion isn't a game. \nâ€” ðŸ“–Sarah The GypsyðŸ“š (@ToothpasteWords) February 23, 2017 \nExactly. If people like Bowen are willing to guest star on shows to raise money for the butchers they clearly donâ€™t need our tax dollars. @PriceIsRight @itsJulieBowen What a terrible, horrible \"charity\": Murdering and merchandising the corpses of innocent children. \nâ€” Alec Thomson (@ThomsonAlec) February 23, 2017 Trending ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:55:55.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
