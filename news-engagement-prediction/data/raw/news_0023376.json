It’s easy to shout ‘Wenger Out’ but just who comes next? \n“With the composition of the fanbase these days, the most likely protest will be in the form of empty seats,” he told Standard Sport. \n“Fans I talk to are extremely frustrated but there is no great desire for organised protest aimed directly at Arsene Wenger given all he has achieved at the club and the result is that many fans simply can’t face going every week. Add in the fact it is a lunchtime kick-off on a cold weekend at the start of half-term against modest opposition and the crowd could be 10,000 below capacity.” Photo: Getty Images \nArsenal state their official attendances in terms of tickets sold but the number of supporters actually coming through the turnstiles has often shown to be lower; a 2014 Metropolitan Police report suggested the average figure was around 5,000 fewer than the declared number of just under 60,000, although this estimate did not include fans who entered through stadium car parks. Ten events that defined Arsene Wenger's Arsenal reign Ten events that defined Arsene Wenger's Arsenal reign 1/11 \nOn Arsene Wenger's 20th anniversary at Arsenal Standard Sport examines some of the defining points of time in his reign. Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images 2/11 Listening to his players (1996) \nThe first defining moment of Arsene Wenger’s tenure came before he had even taken charge. The Frenchman was watching from the stands on September 1996 with Pat Rice in charge for the Uefa Cup trip to Borussia Monchengladbach. Though he hadn’t yet started work Wenger had his part to play in the 3-2 defeat, suggesting “one or two changes” that left Tony Adams far from impressed – the club captain accused his new manager of putting Arsenal’s season in jeopardy before he had even started work. Rather than look to stamp his authority on his new players Wenger chose to embrace Adams’ criticism, setting the tone for a regime that would always value the input of those on the pitch. Shaun Botterill/ALLSPORT 3/11 Nicolas Anelka proves to be the perfect Wenger buy (1997) \nThe second unknown Frenchman to define Arsenal’s early years Nicolas Anelka would play a crucial role in the 1998 Double and establish Wenger as the perfect manager for any bright young forward to work with. Bought from Paris St Germain for £500,000 in February 1997 his £22.3million sale to Real Madrid a little over two years later would fund the new training ground at London Colney with enough left over to bring in another young Frenchman… Thierry Henry. Not a bad bit of business. Ben Radford/Allsport/Getty Images 4/11 Bould’s lob, Adams’ volley (1998) \nAs brilliant as the free-flowing football has been at Arsenal over recent years Wenger has always had exactly the right players to do the job. That was not quite the case when he arrived, with defensive solidity the order of the day. But it didn’t take long for him to get his ideas across. The revolution’s highlight came as Arsenal romped to the title with a 4-0 win over Everton. Steve Bould steps forward to steal possession and lobs a pass forward for Tony Adams, bursting in past the backline to volley beyond Thomas Myhre. All that from two of the old guard. 5/11 FA Cup loss is nobody’s fault (2001) \nA Michael Owen double in the final ten minutes saw Liverpool secure a scarcely deserved FA Cup win but had Thierry Henry taken his chances the game would have been over well before the 80th minute. On three occasions the Frenchman spurned chances he would invariably finish in years to come. But Wenger backed his man to get it right and his faith was rewarded. Over the next three seasons Henry scored 103 goals in 155 games; Arsenal won the league twice. Clive Brunskill/Allsport 6/11 “It wouldn’t surprise me if we were to go unbeaten for the whole of the season” (2002) \nHe may have been a season out with his prediction but we can forgive him a degree of inaccuracy such was the remarkable achievement of his 2003-04 Invincibles. Several players have since said Wenger’s confidence inhibited them in a run-in where they handed the title to Manchester United but Arsenal were to prove their manager’s faith right a year later... Craig Prentis/Getty Images 7/11 The Battle of Old Trafford (2003) \nAnd the defining moment of that season was to come as early as September, when Ruud van Nistelrooy’s missed penalty allowed Arsenal to escape their clash with a 0-0 draw. Ugly confrontations from both sides at the final whistle saw suspensions handed out to Martin Keown, Ray Parlour and Lauren, as well as Patrick Viera, who had been sent off in the match. “When I saw my team-mates being full of passion and fighting I knew this was a really great team,” said Jens Lehmann, who had arrived in the summer. This was a team of fighters, galvanized in their pursuit of the title. Getty 8/11 Patrick Vieira makes way for Cesc Fabregas (2005) \nA new era began when club captain Patrick Vieira left for Juventus, with Wenger choosing to place his faith in a 18-year-old to replace one of Arsenal’s greatest ever players. The same would be true as Dennis Bergkamp, Robert Pires, Freddie Ljungberg and Thierry Henry left over the following years, with a new side constructed around the likes of Theo Walcott, Robin van Persie and other bright youngsters. Ben Radford/Getty Images 9/11 David Dein’s departure (2007) \nThe exit of vice-chairman David Dein briefly brought instability to the club, with Stan Kroenke beginning to acquire shares and the problems at board room convincing Henry that his time was up. Wenger reportedly sought assurances on his future but five months after Dein’s exit the manager signed up for the long haul once more, agreeing a contract extension to keep him at the Emirates until 2011. 10/11 Manchester United 8 Arsenal 2 (2011) \nIt seemed the most humiliating result of Wenger’s tenure and remains a painful memory for Arsenal supporters. But credit to the Arsenal manager, who immediately set about rectifying the most significant issues in a team shorn of Cesc Fabregas and Samir Nasri. The arrival of Per Mertesacker and Mikel Arteta on deadline day brought the leadership the club lacked; the pair would be crucial contributors as Arsenal slowly rediscovered their winning edge. ANDREW YATES/AFP/Getty Images 11/11 Mesut Ozil signs for £42.5million (2013) \nExpectations around Arsenal have reached new levels since the arrival of Ozil, which coincided with the club finally being freed from the debt that came with constructing the Emirates. It may just be that with the German, Alexis Sanchez and Petr Cech in this side consistent top four finishes are not enough. Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images \nThe Gunners introduced a Ticket Exchange programme to give season ticket holders unable to attend games the chance to re-sell their seats for individual matches. Arsenal claim 70,000 tickets were exchanged through the system last year making it the most successful programme of its type, also ensuring they do not fall into the hands of touts. \nA club source insisted the number of tickets available for the match is not unusual — there were more circulating for November’s visit of Bournemouth — but the AST believes a home credit system would be of greater benefit. Arsenal vs Hull: Premier League preview \nAlthough Arsenal’s case is often highlighted, the problem is prevalent at a number of clubs and Payton claims they should copy the model employed by several German sides which involves revoking season tickets from individuals who regularly fail to attend games. \n“A significant number of season ticket holders now pick and choose the games they come to,” he said. “Some of this is the driven by apathy and the sense the club has gone stale but it also reflects the change in the fanbase. \n“The AST believes a full Emirates with a good atmosphere helps the team. That is why we are co-ordinating campaigning on Safe Standing and also want to see Arsenal introduce a home credit system that rewards those fans who ensure their seats are full every week.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T16:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:14:17.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
