News. \n\"In reference to Mr. Lagerfeld's 'statement,' there is no 'controversy': Karl Lagerfeld, a prominent designer, defamed me, my stylist, and the illustrious designer whose dress I chose to wear, in an important industry publication,\" Meryl's statement reads. \n\"That publication printed this defamation, unchecked. Subsequently, the story was picked up globally, and continues, globally, to overwhelm my appearance at the Oscars, on the occasion of my record breaking 20th nomination, and to eclipse this honor in the eyes of the media, my colleagues and the audience. I do not take this lightly, and Mr. Lagerfeld's generic 'statement' of regret for this 'controversy' was not an apology. He lied, they printed the lie, and I am still waiting,\" it ended. Photos \nMeryl Streep: Movie Star \nStreep is referring to a statement Lagerfeld gave to WWD on Saturday in hopes of clarifying his previous comments. \n\"Chanel engaged in conversations with Ms. Streep's stylist, on her request, to design a dress for her to wear to the Academy Awards,\" it read. \"After an informal conversation, I misunderstood that Ms. Streep may have chosen another designer due to remuneration, which Ms. Streep's team has confirmed is not the case. I regret this controversy and wish Ms. Streep well with her 20th Academy Award nomination.\" \nIn Lagerfeld's initial interview, he claimed days after his team had started working on an embroidered gray silk gown, someone from Streep's team allegedly called him and said, \"'Don't continue the dress. We found somebody who will pay us.'\" \n\"A genius actress, but cheapness also, no?\" he added to the magazine. At the time, Meryl's rep told us in a statement, \"This is a completely untrue story. Ms. Streep would NEVER wear anything in exchange for payment.\" Watch E!'s live 2017 Oscars red carpet coverage on Sunday, Feb. 26 starting at 1:30 p.m. ET/10:30 a.m. PT, and join the conversation on Oscar.com and across social with #oscars and #eredcarpet.
