Photo: Chiang Ying-Ying \n\"Labor defeated the plebiscite bill for marriage equality last year in a very \"cutting off one's nose to spite one's face\" move, and we could have had marriage equality probably after this Saturday,\" he told ABC radio. \n\"There's no Coalition bill before the house at the moment to deal with marriage equality, and until and if there is, then it's a moot point.\" Advertisement \nTreasurer Scott Morrison, an opponent of same-sex marriage, said he would \"leave the fake news to others. This is not an issue that is focusing the government's attention\". \nFairfax Media stands by its report. \nMr Turnbull said on Sunday the issue could be debated again in the partyroom but \"the government's position is that which we took to the election\". \nSupporters of a free vote in the Liberal Party were tight-lipped about their plans on Monday, but Coalition MPs George Christensen and Eric Abetz - who both oppose the change - both pushed back against the prospect of a move by Liberal Party moderates for the government to hold a free vote on same-sex marriage without a national plebiscite. \nMr Christensen said the government needed to stick with the policy it took to the election. \n\"If this government goes down the road of breaking its agreement with the people that we made that we were going to do to a plebiscite, then, you know, the show's over,\" he said. \nAnother political opponent of the law change, who asked not be named, said the net effect of the debate over the weekend - which prompted former prime minister Tony Abbott to speak out on the issue and warn Mr Turnbull not to change policy - was that a law change was less likely. \n\"There will be no change on the plebiscite, no one wants this debate. All the people pushing for it are in safe seats, or inner-city electorates, or both.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:59:18.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
