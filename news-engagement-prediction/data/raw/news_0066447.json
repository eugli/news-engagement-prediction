They found the post-menopausal group had a better network of blood vessels, supplying more oxygen where it was needed. This indicated their muscles had adapted better to the exercise, the researchers found. Writing in the journal, they said: ‘These findings suggest that the early post-menopausal phase is associated with an enhanced capacity of the leg vasculature and skeletal muscle mitochondria to adapt to exercise training. An estimated 1.9million women in Britain go through the menopause at any one time ‘The ability to deliver oxygen to match the demand of the active muscles is preserved in the early phase following the menopausal transition.’ Dr Michael Nyberg, one of the researchers, added: ‘The present study pinpoints a possible signalling pathway at the cellular level that may underlie the higher sensitivity to physical activity in recent postmenopausal women. ‘Future studies should, therefore, further explore this pathway in both animal and human models.’ The findings suggest it is never too late to take up exercise, The menopause can cause depression, hot flushes, headaches and night sweats. Long term, it can also cause bone disease and memory loss. Some 80 per cent of these women are thought to experience symptoms, which typically last for about four years. But regular exercise undertaken during these years is known to have lasting benefits. The menopause can cause depression, hot flushes, headaches and night sweats. Long term, it can also cause bone disease and memory loss And with the latest life expectancy projections suggesting women who are in their early 50s today are likely to live until their late 80s, most will have at least another three decades of life still to prepare for. Many people suspect if they do not live an active lifestyle by the time they reach middle age, it may be too late to make a difference. But researchers have found taking up exercise even in the 40s, 50s or even 60s can make a major difference. A Danish study of 45,000 people aged between 50 and 65, last year reported that those who spent half an hour cycling a week had a 16 per cent reduced risk of a heart attack. Separate research, published last year, found that walking for just 20 minutes a day in your 50s or 60s could add up to seven years to your life. And Swedish academics have found that even after a lifetime of inactivity, taking up exercise as late as your 60s can still make a marked improvement to a person’s health. Scientists think this is because even modest exercise has an anti-ageing effect on cells which could extend lifespan.
