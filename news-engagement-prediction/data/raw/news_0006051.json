For emigrating Brits, it seems Australia is the most popular destination, reports Richard Ford at The Times. The United Kingdom was the most popular destination for those who were born in Lithuania, Ireland and Cyprus And the figures of 4.97 million Brits living overseas is the highest in the European Union, followed by Poland with 4.4 million people. The number of Poles living in other countries was 11.5 per cent of its population in 2015 - a higher percentage than the UK. Germany had 4 million people leave the country by the end of 2015 - or 5 per cent - while Italy had 2.9 million - equating to 4.9 per cent. Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of Migration Watch UK, campaigns for lower immigration and said the figures were a result of huge disparities in income levels. He told the paper: 'This is the result of huge disparities in income levels and living standards between the rich and less well-off member states of the EU and other poorer European countries.'
