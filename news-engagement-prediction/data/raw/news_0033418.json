(Photo: JOHN COLLIER DFP) 24 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWith no knock against anybody else -- well, maybe it is -- we're going to see a new type of sports owner in operation here now that Mike Ilitch, the pizza-pizza king, has acquired the Detroit Red Wings. This is a guy accustomed to tossing a wad of dough into the air and catching a winner. \nMore than the owners of any of our teams, he knows his game -- not only the talents required to play it, but the techniques and strategies, the people involved. It's important; he will not be easily fooled or misled. You assume he knows all one needs to know about business, but he brings something more. \nHe's a winner, a man driven by desire to be the best at whatever he attempts. \nHe had dreamed mightily of owning the Tigers, just as he dreamed years ago of playing shortstop for them. He had been in their farm system for three years when they acquired Harvey Kuenn. With that, he became a realist and quit the game, just as he later quit dreaming of owning the Tigers when it became apparent John Fetzer was determined to remain. \nRelated: — Joe Louis Arena (@JoeLouisArena) February 11, 2017 \nHe'd spend it all to be the best Several years ago, long before he began thinking seriously of buying the Red Wings, Ilitch, like so many other fans, was dismayed by the poor performances of all our professional teams. What he told me then should provide a clue as to how he will handle the Red Wings and what he will expect from them. Essentially, he blamed the other club owners for failure of their teams. \nMike Ilitch, 52, bought the Red Wings in 1982. (Photo: MANNY CRISOSTOMO DFP) \n\"I can't believe the team owners in town,\" he said at the time. \"I'd spend every penny I have to be the best. That's what sports are all about. That's what a team owner should be all about. It's a matter of pride -- if you don't have it or aren't willing, then stay the hell out and let somebody else do it.\" \nHe could not realize then that eventually he would wind up in that elite group of professional sports owners which includes Fetzer, the Lions' William Clay Ford and the Pistons' Bill Davidson. Now he has jumped feet first into ownership of a team that could cause almost anyone to land on his head. \nIlitch, who founded and operates the ever-expanding Little Caesars Pizza empire (and holds Midwest franchising rights for Wendy's and Chuck E. Cheese's) is a multi-millionaire, though not in the ultra class of Fetzer-Ford-Davidson. Even so, he comes to the Red Wings with a background in sports unmatched by the others.
