So what's actually happened? \nMore than 100 tech businesses have stated their opposition to US President Donald Trump's immigration ban . \nThe companies have voiced their concerns over Mr Trump's executive order on banning people from seven Muslim-majority nations. \nThey say it's discriminatory and would have a negative impact on business . Why is this such a big deal? \nFirst , there are some pretty big names on the list of 127 companies, all of which account for thousands of employees throughout the United States and beyond. \nSecond , it's not just a petition. \nWhat started out as just a few comments from tech industry leaders has now gone on to become a brief in the court case which will decide the fate of Mr Trump's travel ban. \nThe suit originally brought by Washington and Minnesota resulted in a nationwide hold on the ban. \nThey have filed what's called an \"amicus brief\", which is a legal document submitted to a court by non-litigants with a strong interest in the subject matter. \nThey are used to give additional information or arguments that courts can consider when making a decision. \nPart of the brief reads: \n\"The Order represents a significant departure from the principles of fairness and predictability that have governed the immigration system of the United States for more than 50 years â€” and the Order inflicts significant harm on American business, innovation, and growth as a result. The Order makes it more difficult and expensive for US companies to recruit, hire, and retain some of the world's best employees. It disrupts ongoing business operations. And it threatens companies' ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States.\" \nThe brief also highlighted their concerns about the ban being expanded and lengthened from 90 days. \nIt also follows a meeting between Mr Trump and Silicon Valley executives last December to smooth over frictions ahead of his inauguration. What companies have joined the list? \nThe big ones . \nApple, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter are on the list. \nOther companies include eBay, Etsy, Airbnb, Dropbox, Netflix, Pinterest, Reddit, Yelp, Spotify, PayPal and Mozilla. \nSome have taken it one step further with Airbnb launching a Super Bowl ad campaign with the hashtag #weaccept in a direct response to the travel ban. Any random players? \nYep. \nChobani was on the list. Yes, the yoghurt company . But it's a company with strong ties to the refugee cause. The company employs more than 300 refugees and was founded by Kurdish immigrant Hamdi Ulukaya. \nJeans company Levi Strauss & Co also made the list. The company was founded by German migrant Levi Strauss in 1848. Any other businesses feeling anti-Trump pressure? \nTech companies are not the only businesses feeling the pressure to distance themselves from the new president. \nDepartment store Nordstorm confirmed on Thursday it would cut ties with Ivanka Trump's band. \nNow Macy's is under pressure to do the same, according to the Business Insider Australia. \nLast week it was revealed that Uber chief executive officer Travis Kalanick, who was on Mr Trump's business advisory board, has stepped down from the role after his post at the time of the immigration ban received immense backlash from users and is one of the companies now on the tech company brief submitted to court. \nUber is also on the amicus brief. What's President Donald Trump's response been? \nWhile Mr Trump has been extremely vocal about his thoughts on the judge who blocked the ban, it seems the businessman has not yet spoken out against the companies who have joined the brief opposing the order. \nWe'll keep you posted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:31:07.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
