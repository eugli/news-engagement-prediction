She said: 'I would be putting some pressure [on his thigh] with my elbow then I felt his hand on my buttocks. It was almost as if he was holding on. Gardner began to ask her whether she had a boyfriend and then asking her why not. She said: 'I didn't want to be having that conversation with him, I didn't particularly know him.' He was struck off when he came before a hearing at the Health and Care Professions Council The woman said that when she mentioned she was visiting her parents who lived in Spain and Gardner suggested meeting. Asked if the conversation was 'jokey' she said: 'No, not to me.' Gardner admitted it was possible his penis may have accidentally fallen out of his Y-fronts, but denied wearing loose-fitting underwear. 'I'm aware that loose-fitting underwear could make exposure more possible. I wore more conservative underwear, Y-fronts.' He said he wore what he felt was 'appropriate clothing' for a treatment session. But the panel concluded that Gardner 'had decided to wear loose fitting underwear which he would have known as an experienced physiotherapist could expose his penis.' Panel chair Janet Everitt said: 'We found the registrant intentionally left his penis exposed for a period of time in order to obtain sexual gratification.' The panel also found that Gardner's repeated touching of the student was 'avoidable' and sexually motivated. Ms Everitt said:'Such behaviour was a breach of trust in that he was fundamentally in the role of teacher.' Gardner also asked a colleague inappropriate questions about her sex life 'out of the blue', asking if she used a vibrator with her husband because he was 'c**p in bed'. Ms Everitt said: 'Her evidence was that he moved extremely close to her, and straddled either side of her chair with his legs, with his body leaning forward, although not touching her. 'Out of the blue, he asked her if she had a vibrator in a low whispering tone.' Gardner accepted he 'engaged in adult banter in the staff room'. Last July the panel made a nine-month interim conditions of practice order 'for the protection of the public' and banned him from working with female colleagues without a chaperone. Ms Everitt added: 'We found there was an ongoing and unacceptable risk that the sexual misconduct could be repeated.' Ordering Gardner should be struck off the HCPC register Ms Everitt said he had 'demonstrated an inability to resolve or remedy his sexually motivated conduct'. He has 28 days to appeal against the decision.
