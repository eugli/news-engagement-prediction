'While most places have some chance of rain all this week, not everyone will see rain every day. Those with the highest chance of rain every day will be in the north.' Rain is expected to arrive for much of the east coast on Tuesday (left), before strengthening and moving south into Wednesday While most areas are predicted rain for the entire week, forecasters say it will not be continuous, and will come and go in showers (Thursday's forecast left, and Friday, right) Mr Sharpe added that coastal areas will largely see their showers in the morning and evening, while inland areas will get rain in the afternoons. Sydney is most likely to see rain on Thursday, Mr Sharpe said, with heavy showers and storms possible in the city. The risk of showers will continue throughout this week, across the weekend and into next week, Mr Sharpe said. The rain is expected to continue throughout the weekend, and while things are expected to brighten next week, forecaster say that is not certain (Saturday forecast, left, Sunday, right) The weather is a far cry from the record-breaking highs seen a fornight ago across most of New South Wales (Bondi Beach, pictured) The showers will mark and end to the summer heat, though autumn is expected to be warmer than average (pictured, a sun-seeker in Sydney) While things are expected to start drying out early next week, even that is not certain, he added. Temperatures will remain firmly fixed at a high of 26C across the week, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, signalling the change to autumn. While there is a good chance that autumn will be warmer than average, Mr Sharpe said, there will not be a return to the extreme highs of summer.
