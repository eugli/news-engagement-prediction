By Richard Tanner PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 12:01, Mon, Feb 27, 2017 \nJose Mourinho and the United board made up their minds a long time ago that they want to trigger the second season option in the contract the Swedish striker signed last summer. \nAnd his two-goal display as Manchester United lifted the EFL Cup at Wembley yesterday only served to underline how important the 35-year-old has become to the club. \nBut Zlatan Ibrahimovic says he will wait until the end of the season to make his final decision. And he will only carry on if he believes he can still produce top level performances rather than rely on his reputation and status. \n“Let’s see what happens,” he said after the win over Southampton. “I mean the moment, how I feel, the situation, we have another two months of the season to go, because according to many I could not do what I’ve been doing.

I will not play one game by being simply ‘Ibrahimovic’ and for what I have done before in the game. If I don’t perform, if I don’t bring results, I will not play. \n“I will not be like other players, playing on because they have made a great career and name and they are still playing because they are who they are. I will play as long as I can bring results.” \nIbrahimovic denied his decision will be shaped by whether Untied finish in the top four and qualify of next season’s Champions League – a trophy he has never won. \n“No, it’s not about that.,” he added. “I came here and the club wasn’t in the Champions League. So I it had nothing to do with the Champions League. So somebody made up a story that if they don’t qualify for the Champions League I will not extend.

I train hard. People who know me from the locker room know that I train very hard. I have an objective every season I go into. And to reach that objective I need to train hard and I need to suffer when I train. That is how I achieve what I achieve. \n“I’m from the old school where they work hard and get what they get from doing the hard work not like the new school where it is easy to get what you want. \n“In my head I’m never satisfied - I always want more. I’m hungry to do more. That is my mentality. I’m not satisfied with what I’m doing – I always want more. \n“This is my 32nd trophy. I’ve been in five different countries, I’ve been in the best clubs in the world and I’m repeating every year, what I am doing. This is another chapter in my career.” \nIbrahimovic has 26 goals in all competitions and if he continues his current strike rate is on course for around 40 because United could still have 23 more games to play – 13 in the Premier League and a possible 10 more in the Europa League and FA Cup, if they go all the way in those two competitions. \nHe bagged a career best 51 for Paris St Germain last season but will not reveal his personal target this season. “I will let you know when I am finished.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:05:36.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
