Ho / Los Angeles Times) Craig Nakano, Richard S. Ginell \nLos Angeles Opera got not one but two curtain calls Sunday, as the company took home two Grammy Awards for “The Ghosts of Versailles.” \nThe recording of the work, composed by John Corigliano and librettist William M. Hoffman, earned the opera Grammy for a team that included conductor James Conlon ; performers Joshua Guerrero, Christopher Maltman, Lucas Meachem, Patricia Racette, Lucy Schaufer and Guanqun Yu; and producer Blanton Alspaugh. \nOther nominees in the category included Santa Fe Opera’s recording of Jennifer Higdon’s “Cold Mountain,” the Salzburg Whitsun Festival production of “Giulio Cesare,” Yannick Nézet-Séguin’s “The Marriage of Figaro” and the Royal Opera of London’s “King Roger.” \n“The Ghosts of Versailles” recording for Pentatone also won best engineered classical album. \nIn the orchestral performance category, last year’s winner — conductor Andris Nelsons and Boston Symphony Orchestra — took top honors again, this time for “Shostakovich: Under Stalin's Shadow — Symphonies Nos. 5, 8 & 9,” beating out, among others, Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony’s recording of “Bates: Works for Orchestra.” \nEsa-Pekka Salonen and Los Angeles Philharmonic live recording of Frank Zappa’s “200 Motels” lost in the Grammy’s compendium category to “Daugherty: Tales of Hemingway; American Gothic; Once Upon a Castle” (Giancarlo Guerrero conductor, Tim Handley producer). \nIn the contemporary classical composition category, the winner was Michael Daugherty for “Tales of Hemingway.” \nThe chamber music and small ensemble Grammy went to Steve Reich for “Third Coast Percussion.” \nDavid Frost was named classical producer of the year, beating out Alspaugh, Judith Sherman, Robina G. Young and the team of Marina A. Ledin and Victor Ledin. Caption 'Step' shows us its moves at Sundance \nThe young women in \"Step\" demonstrate a routine at the L.A.
