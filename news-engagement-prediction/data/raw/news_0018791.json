It asked the minister how many times she had visited the property in the past 12 months, what funds were used to purchase it and whether she had a personal relationship with a man who allegedly approves payments on behalf of the department. \nShivambu charged on Twitter: \"Minister of Water & Sanitation has outsourced the ministry to a Ben 10, who she travelled with to Iran and New York last year.\" \nThe Water and Sanitation ministry charged that the allegations were aimed at tarnishing Mokonyane's image. \n\"The minister rejects the allegations as unfounded, without factual basis and refuses to be intimidated by such actions for the benefit of EFF financial and political interests and those whose financial fortunes they seek to bolster by such action,\" it said. While the EFF leadership was preparing for last night's State of the Nation Address , it indicated that its commander-in-chief, Julius Malema, had \"academic obligations\". \nEFF chairman Dali Mpofu tweeted: \"Being EFF president is no easy job: University exam on Wednesday... 'War' on Thursday evening... Another exam on Friday morning! #GoodLuckCiC.\" Share Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
