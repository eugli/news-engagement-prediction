In Houston, we're all one,\" he says.\n\"This is a culture that embraces people, not only that look like you but those that don't look like you.\"\nSUPER BOWL LIVE: Houston's Lyric Michelle makes a big, brief impression\nBun B mingled with fans Thursday at the Galleria to unveil his New Era cap collection at the Lids store. It includes three colorful designs inspired by the Houston Astros, Rockets and Texans. Each cap retails for $34.99 and features the rapper's \"Trill OG\" logo.\nHe worked closely with designers to \"put our own little twist on it\" and has previously collaborated with the brand on caps.\nThe unveiling was just of many stops on his Super Bowl week goodwill tour.\n\"It's been nonstop. I haven't gotten much rest. But I don't wanna have rest. I wanna make sure that I'm everywhere I need to be to represent the city to the fullest of my capabilities,\" he said.\n\"I'm gonna be tired at the end of this week. But I'm happy to be an ambassador of the city of Houston.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303999/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303999/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303996/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303996/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303998/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303994/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303995/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303994/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303997/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303992/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303995/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303992/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303997/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/71/12303998/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-03T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:24:15.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
