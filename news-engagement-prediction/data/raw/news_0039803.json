I'm happy to report I also like their Q-Adapt headphones , which reminded me about all the benefits of dongle-less wired headphones. \nUnlike most earbuds I try, these are shaped like \"iPod earbuds\" with a gummy eartip attached to a hard, rounded shell at the end. I haven't used earbuds like this since abandoning Apple's EarPods last year, and it was actually pretty nice to go back. The rounded buds sit better in my ear and don't feel like putting a pair of earplugs in my ear. \nIf you typically have problems with earbuds staying in your ears, these could be the headphones you've been looking for. \nThe sound on these earbuds is certainly good for the price: The seal they create is sufficient enough to let bass frequencies sound excellent, while treble-heavy tracks don't sound painful at high volumes. I would even say these headphones are a little on the bassy side, but not to the point of being annoying. \nLibratone \nSubtleties of different songs are audible if the mastering is good enough, and best of all I can listen to music through these earbuds at full volume without any degradation of audio quality. That's a good sign, since I tend to bounce between different genres a lot. \nThe only puzzling part of these headphones is their built-in noise cancelling. Because they use the iPhone's Lightning port, the iPhone powers the noise cancelling, which is very clever. You can trigger the noise cancelling by pushing a button on the headphone's built-in remote. \nIt would be easy to understand if this noise cancelling was binary: Either on or off, but Libratone's noise-cancelling feature has four different settings. \nI found myself pushing the button a couple of different times, and while it was definitely on (and doing something), it was a little difficult for me to suss out any differences. Each setting is meant to block out more noise, but I typically kept it on at the first setting, which blocked out a decent amount of office and train noise during my testing. \nLibratone's Q-Adapt earbuds have a lot of highlights, but my favorite is ultimately their simplicity. \nThere's no fumbling with Bluetooth settings, or dongles hanging off of your phone when you use them. It's something I took for granted when using wired headphones with previous iPhones, but something I'll miss as I continue to test new headphones. \nIf you're an iPhone owner who strives for simplicity, appreciates good design, and cares about audio quality, you should take Libratone's headphones under serious consideration. \nLibratone Q-Adapt Headphones, $179.99, available at Amazon Disclosure: This post is brought to you by Business Insider's Insider Picks team.
