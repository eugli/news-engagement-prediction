Picture courtesy: YouTube \nRoadies Rising is the fourteenth installment of the Roadies series. And it seems like the reality show is getting worse with every passing season. \nThere was a time when people were genuinely interested in the show, mostly because it had a new format and the young generation of the country was more than ready to get on board with a show about expletives, bikes, and 'adventures.' \nAnd we like to repeat what has been successful in the past, even if the show (in this case) has nothing new to offer. \nAlso read: Karan Kundrra confirms he's not part of Roadies; this is what he will do next \nRoadies Rising has five judges--Rannvijay Singha, Neha Dhupia , Harbhajan Singh, Prince Narula, and Karan Kundrra, who has apparently been replaced by Nikhil Chinapa, nevertheless, Karan appears as a judge in the first episode of the show at least. Indian cricketer Harbhajan is the only new addition to the panel. \nIn the first episode of the show, people gave their auditions as usual, out of which one impressed the judges (actress Samyuktha Hegde of Kirik Party fame), one was probably brought in for comic relief, and the other two turned out to be a couple of misogynists, who liked to hit women. \nWhy are we not surprised? \nThis has happened in almost all the auditions in the previous seasons of the show. While we agree that all kinds of people exist in the real world, but it is such a bad case of history-tends-to-repeat-itself that we just don't know which part of the show is real and which part is 'scripted.' \nAnd while we are on the topic of scripted, let us talk about the camaraderie shared by our judges. Awkward, forced, and not at all warm or funny. \nWhat is new about the show, you ask? Apart from Harbhajan, nothing much. \nWhy should you watch it? There is really no strong reason for it. \nBut if you still want to catch it, tune in to MTV every weekend at 7 pm.
