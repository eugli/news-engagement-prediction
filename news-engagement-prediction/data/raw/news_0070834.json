Key points: Speaker, Deputy Speaker resignations are the \"right decisions\" Premier says Speaker Telmo Languiller accepted he needed to pay for his \"error of judgement\" Deputy Speaker Don Nardella said he acted in accordance with all of the rules \nSpeaker Telmo Languiller, the Labor member for Tarneit, and his deputy, Don Nardella, the MP for Melton, resigned after it was revealed both men who represent seats in the western suburbs had claimed an allowance intended for country MPs. \nUnder parliamentary rules, politicians are entitled to the \"second residence\" allowance if their home base is at least 80km from Melbourne's CBD and they keep a second property in the city. \nMr Languiller, who told Parliament he moved to Queenscliff, 80 kilometres from Melbourne because of \"complex family reasons\", had promised to repay $37,678 he claimed under the allowance. \nHowever in a statement on Saturday, Mr Languiller said he recognised that offering to repay the money was not enough and that he accepted he should \"pay for that error of judgement\". Allowance meant for regional MPs \nBut it was unclear if Mr Nardella would repay his allowances, claimed to be as much as $100,000. Photo: Mr Nardella said he acted in accordance with the rules. (Supplied: Parliament of Victoria) \nHis announcement came just a few hours after Mr Languiller's resignation. \nMr Nardella said he had responded to a media question about his primary and secondary residence and associated parliamentary allowances. \n\"I responded truthfully and fully to that request for information,\" he said. \n\"I have acted in accordance with all rules regarding Member of Parliament allowances.\" \nLabor Premier Daniel Andrews said the resignations were the right decisions. \n\"It is self-evident that the second residence allowances is meant for regional MPs who must travel to Melbourne for Parliament,\" he said. \n\"For that reason, I have asked the Special Minister of State to urgently determine what changes are required so what has occurred in these instances does not happen again.\" \nBoth MPs will move to the back bench and candidates for the speaker's positions would be nominated at the next meeting of caucus. \nLiberal MP Tim Smith welcomed the resignations but said Mr Nardella should be forced to repay the money he claimed. \n\"The Premier's statement was silent on the money... the $100,000 he's collected since April 2014 that he should never have received,\" he said. \n\"The taxpayers want their money back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:47:54.769+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
