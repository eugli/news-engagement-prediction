Photograph: Matthew Chattle/REX/Shutterstock   Thursday 2 February 2017 16.18 GMT Last modified on Thursday 2 February 2017 16.36 GMT \nSome of the UK’s most prominent Muslim organisations will stage a demonstration outside the US embassy on Saturday in protest at President Trump’s order blocking travel to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries . \nThousands are expected to join the third protest against aspects of the Trump presidency to take place in London in a fortnight. One of the organisers hopes to see “unprecedented numbers” of Muslims attend. \nThe Muslim Council of Britain, MEND, Friends of al-Aqsa and others will be joined by Stand Up to Racism, Stop the War and the People’s Assembly for a rally and march from the US embassy to Downing Street. The rally meets at Grosvenor Square at 11am. \nSeparately, Jewish, Christian and other faith groups have announced plans to form a human circle of solidarity outside a London mosque during Friday prayers. \nThe march is protesting an executive order issued by Trump that suspends entry to the US for nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries for three months to combat terrorism. The order caused chaos and protests at airports worldwide as officials scrambled to interpret how it applied to travellers already in the air. \nChildren were among those prevented from boarding flights, detained for hours at airports and in some cases returned to their countries. The US administration was forced to clarify that it did not apply to green card holders. Trump has also vowed to introduce “extreme vetting” to keep “radical Islamic terrorism” out of the country. \nThe policies and rhetoric are “normalising a level of Islamophobia that we should not accept”, said Weyman Bennett of Stand Up to Racism, speaking at a press conference at the East London mosque. \nHis group called for campaigners from other causes, including the environment, opposing antisemitism and fighting homophobia, to join the march: “We want to stand in solidarity with the Muslim community over the question of the ban.” \nSabby Dhalu, co-convenor of Stand Up to Racism, said the refugees left trapped at airports last weekend were fleeing terrorism themselves, and worldwide the vast majority of victims of terrorism were Muslims. \n“I think what he [Donald Trump] is doing is damaging the whole social fabric of our society,” said Dilowar Khan, executive director of the East London mosque, warning that racists would gain “moral support” from his approach. \nAzad Ali, head of community engagement at MEND, warned that society could be “sleepwalking into genocide”, adding: “We need to engage, and to become active citizens. This is just an initial step.” \nBeyond the march, he pointed to initiatives such as Visit My Mosque day, which takes place on Sunday, as an effort “to break down the myths of what’s happening in a mosque: there isn’t anything to be scared of”. \nHe told the Guardian his organisation and others are developing contacts with groups in the US such as ACLU and Care to offer solidarity. \nSeparately, a human circle of solidarity will be formed outside a north London mosque during Friday prayers in an event backed by a coalition of faith groups. \nThe aim is to “stand with our Muslim brothers and sisters at this time of international turbulence”, said the organisers. Members of Reform Judaism, the Christian Muslim Forum, Faiths Forum for London and other groups will gather at the Wightman Road mosque before noon prayers. \nRabbi Laura Janner-Klausner, senior rabbi to Reform Judaism, said: “This week started with President Trump’s executive order, and is ending with news that antisemitism is at record levels in the UK. [On Friday] we will show our determination, as minorities and people of different religions, to stand together and protect one another.” \nAjmal Masroor of the Islamic Society of Britain said his organisation had been contacted by people of many faiths and beliefs wanting to show solidarity following Trump’s executive order and the deadly attack on a mosque in Quebec. \nHe said: “These leaders want to relay the message that we are all equal citizens of this great country and that we must stand as one when any of us feels isolated or scared. We are deeply touched by this real show of support.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T23:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T18:55:42.657+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
