Photo: Nick Moir \nPower will be cut to the area for days after electricity cables were brought to the ground, and in at least one spot lay across the Golden Highway, forcing vehicles to cross them. Dozens of wooden power poles were still smouldering on Monday. \nSeveral hundred metres from Mr Boundy's property in Uarbry, Steve and Ruth White surveyed the remains of their four-bedroom home for the past 23 years on Main Street. \n\"We have only got we have got on,\" said Mr White, a stock-truck driver, pausing momentarily as the shock of what lay before them on their return home sank in on Monday. \nThinking he was going to lose his house, a neighbour had parked his vintage Holden ute on a small patch of green grass at the Whites because he reasoned it stood a better chance of withstanding the fire there. \nWhile, to his surprise, his prized ute and home survived largely intact, the Whites lost everything apart from about seven cattle, their chooks and a small shed. \n\"Nobody could tell us anything [before they returned to their property on Monday],\" Mrs White said. \n\"We were worried about the animals. But we can't leave them here because there is not enough feed, plus there is not enough water. The tanks have melted and the pumps have melted.\" \nMrs White, struggling for words at times, said she lost all of her treasured photographs. \n\"It's not so much the old family ones, because all of my sisters and brothers have copies, but it's the ones of my kids and grandkids. All my favourite ones are gone,\" she said. Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:23:53.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
