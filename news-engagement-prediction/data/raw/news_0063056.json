I haven't eaten since yesterday,\" she told one victim in a text message. \n\"My pension here 2 day can spare 100 for yr tucker. Loving U as ever X,\" he replied. \nOne 69-year-old man gave Derbas $1.7 million, initially to help her pay her mortgage in 2008. \nWhen he asked to be repaid, she said she could not because her son had died of swine flu. \nShe took more than $180,000 from another victim after asking for help covering the funeral expenses of her dead daughter. \nShe also told most of her seven victims her mother had died, in spite of the fact she was alive and well and living down the street from her. \nWhen police searched her home in the western Sydney suburb of Miller, they found 15 phones as well as an address book containing the names of 349 men.
