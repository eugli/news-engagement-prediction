By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Saturday, February 25, 2017 - 00:10 0 Follow @ZeeNewsSports \nNew Delhi: For a change, bowlers have so far taken the lead roles in the first Test match of the India-Australia series in Pune. But their acts have been supported by fielders taking brilliant catches. \nOn Thursday, on Day 1 of the Test, Indian wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha produced a stunning flying catch which has earned him the nickname of 'Superman'. \nHere's the video: \nThen, on Day 2, Peter Handscomb showed his class by conjuring fielding magic to haunt Indian camp. He was involved in as many as three dismissals, those of Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and Ravichandran Ashwin. \nIn the 15th over, he took a relatively easy catch at first catch to send Kohli back for a second-ball duck, off the bowling of Mitchell Starc. \nIt was followed by the wicket of Rahane. A superb reflex action catch at the cordon, again. Handscomb dived low to his right to pluck the catch. That happened in the 33rd over, off the bowling of Steve O'Keefe. \nIn the next over, he combined again with another Aussie spinner, Nathan Lyon to remove Ashwin. And this is the best of the lot. A blinder, as any fan would have described. \nAshwin blocked the ball, and it bounced off his toe. But Handscomb dived forward and stuck his hand to complete the catch. What's more heartening was that fact, his catching didn't even touch the ground, showing his brilliant athletic abilities. \nWATCH all the catches HERE \nAustralia eventually bowled out India for a paltry 105, which also witnessed a sensational collapse from the Indians. \nAt the end of Day 2, Aussies have taken a 298-run lead.
