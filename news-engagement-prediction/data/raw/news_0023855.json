Bob Corker of Tennessee, the Republican chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, and veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona. \nFreeland was moved into Foreign Affairs last month in a cabinet shuffle by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau aimed at dealing with the election of Donald Trump as president. \nShe already engaged in a round of Washington networking in December when she was the trade minister. \nFreeland’s trip is part of the Trudeau government’s ongoing full-court press on the Trump administration, which includes Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan’s visit Monday to the Pentagon and a Wednesday visit to Washington by Finance Minister Bill Morneau. \nTillerson, the longtime chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil, was approved as Trump’s top diplomat last week. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:06:49.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
