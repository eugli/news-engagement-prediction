For reference, those people include the likes of James Jebbia (founder of Supreme), Jason Dill (skateboarding legend/style icon), and even Frank Ocean (no explanation required). Elsesser is famous with that ahead-of-the-curve set mostly for being a gifted professional skateboarder, which has lead to him become Supreme's go-to lookbook model, Earl Sweatshirt's roommate, and what's often mischaracterized as a \"Frank Ocean's collaborator.\" (He wouldn't classify their relationship like that, though Elsesser's voice appears on the last song of Ocean's 2016 album Blonde .) Perhaps most lowkey on Elsesser's resumé is that on the day of our shoot, he was just a 20-year-old college student skipping a class at the Pratt Institute, where he's studying fine art. \nElsesser checks all the requisite boxes of a cool kid who would have the inside track on the freshest streetwear, sneakers, and, fittingly, all things Supreme. But he's actually refreshingly unaware of the industry he's increasingly thought of as being a member of. If anything, he's just an influential outsider; the kind of guy who rocked a tucked-in T-shirt and Dickies pants for years before it started popping up in look books and on big-name designer runways. There's a reason the fashion world has turned its attention to skateboarding for inspiration of late, and as time goes on, it becomes harder to dismiss a guy like Elsesser and his ilk as being a crucial part of that attraction. \nYou could dismiss that fact if weren't that Elsesser's personal style weren't in lock step with how a lot guys want to dress today. It's evident in the photos you see here— in his artfully baggy sweats, his patterned Gucci scarf, and those minimally stylish new Converse One Star Court Classic Pro sneakers that feature a premium leather upper (washed suede on the navy blue pair) and hardly any Converse branding. We spoke with the soon-to-be-everywhere Sage Elsesser about the new kicks he helped design, how he got so stylish, and what he thinks about his employer's high-profile collaboration with Louis Vuitton. \nAre you sick of people saying you contributed to Frank Ocean's album? \nYeah, like, guys asking me, \"So explain what having credits on Frank Ocean's album is like?\" Like, I didn't do anything. Like, sure, I'm down, I'm a Frank Ocean collaborator. One time I told someone I wrote \"Solo.\" I told them I wrote that for them and they were like \"Wow! No way!\" \nWhat do you think of the Supreme x Louis Vuitton collaboration? \nIt's cool, fuck yeah, Louis Vuitton. It's another cool collaboration for Supreme, but I just don't really care. There's gonna be another one next year kids are gonna flip on. \nHow does it feel to replace [legendary skateboarder and style icon] Jason Dill as Supreme's official look book model? \nIt's really cool. It happened really quickly. I remember Dill telling me, \"Man, I'm gonna be too old soon and they're gonna ask you to be the model.\" I didn't believe him. Now I've done, like, four of them so it's kind of like, \"When is it gonna stop?\" \nIn your interview Earl Sweatshirt, you reference how your style changed when you moved to New York. How would you describe your style now? \nYeah, he said something, like \"Expensive Roadman.\" I guess that just came from traveling and seeing different places, like Paris, London. It's cool, but I'm all about comfort. I skate for Converse, but I'm not wearing Chuck Taylors all the time. I was able to differentiate my on board style from my regular style. \nHow do you dress differently when you're skating? \nI don't like to wear shorts if I'm skating. I have kind of expensive taste. I wouldn't wear— \nThe Gucci scarf you have on, for instance. \nI actually got this on sale. [laughs] \nIf you know you're being filmed that day while skating, will you step your style up a little bit for the cameras? \nI'm always conscious of what I'm wearing. It's just like how a basketball player doesn't wear a jersey and basketball sneakers all the time. You sweat, you bleed, so you kind of always need to change your clothes. \nHow do you feel about how skate style has recently become so popular in fashion? \nI just think it's corny. It just looks dumb, but it's also cool that, like, Forever 21 is making Trasher, Paradis, and Fucking Awesome tees. Like they want to be on our shit. But I also just see so many kids dressed like Sean Pablo now. \nLike Dickies and Chuck Taylors, tucked in... \nYeah like that's my friend. I know him so well. That's a normal look now. And Sean looks good. If that helps kids dress better so be it. I just thought it was funny because it's something so simple as like tucking in your T-shirt. I see rappers trying it out, like A$AP Rocky, Ty Dolla $ign, and thinking, \"Wow they're looking at us.\" But as far as fashion it's just their inspiration. Every designer uses inspiration, whether it's Supreme, FA [Fucking Awesome], it all comes from inspiration. \nIs it okay to wear skate style if you don't skate? \nI don't give it too much attention. Let Selena Gomez wear a Thrasher shirt, it's popular. Bieber wears FA. People shop at Supreme, like, it's just popular. \nJonah Hill? \nJonah Hill is cool. I've met him before, too. I think he's a little mixed up though, wearing like a Palace hoodie with a Supreme hat and Yeezy Boosts. Get it together, Jonah. \nLet's talk about your Converse collaboration. How did you end up with this design? \nI didn't really design it, I just thought it was a shoe that was really important to the aesthetic of Converse. It's a classic shoe. I thoight recently the direction of Converse has been really Nike-influenced, with the newest technology and breathable fabric and all that bullshit. I just wanted to make a shoe you fucking put on your feet, tie the laces, and do what you do. I wanted just a basic shoe. It's just an old tennis shoe. And I know that's really popular with things like the Stan Smith. \nWhere did you first see the style? \nI was in Japan. And I found the leather we used on a different Converse shoe. \nDo you go through shoes really quickly because you skate so much? \nBut that's just skating. I saw this pair of shoes at Barney's that had like duct tape and were like, $600. \nGolden Goose?
