In the past month, swastikas appeared on a fence in Sienna Plantation, white nationalist fliers popped up on Rice University campus, students at Cypress Ranch High School were caught giving a Nazi salute, and racist fliers circulated in Fort Bend and Montgomery counties. \nCOMING TOGETHER: Support pours in for damaged Jewish cemetery near St. Louis \n\"Clearly, ADL is still needed here. It's been a long time since we've seen so many incidents so close together,\" Gross said at the time. \n\"We need to work together to maintain Houston's track record as a city that handles its unparalleled diversity better than almost any other city in the world. \" \nWednesday's speakers echoed that sentiment. \n\"We're standing shoulder to shoulder, side by side asking you all to expose hate to the light because it can't stand the light of day,\" said Bishop Michael Rinehart of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. \n\"It hides in dark corners. Do not be silent. Silent works to the advantage of the perpetrators.\" Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.
