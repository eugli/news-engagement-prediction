The seemingly perfect, progressive family is in actuality harboring deep rifts. Then, one of the children begins to see things others cannot. Is it mental illness or something else? The series is a tragicomic meditation on the complicated forces at work on everyone in America today. \nGrey's Anatomy and Looking alum Williamsonhas joined as series regular Malcolm Smith, an assistant personal trainer at the Portland women’s soccer team. Not too concerned with ambition, Malcolm is happy to go extreme mountain biking with his best friend Duc (Raymond Lee) and be a great father to his daughter Hailey. His interracial marriage with Ashley Bishop-Black begins to fray when his wife grows weary of being the main bread winner in the family and calls him out on being relatively oblivious to her black experience. \nBean ( Power ) rounds out the cast as Henry, a mysterious free spirit who longs for a simple life outside the city, away from the noise and clamor of civilization. He lives a nomad’s life, couch hopping and making his life up as each day comes along. When he meets Ramon (Daniel Zovatto) at the Portland cafe he works at, they quickly connect and fall in love. Henry struggles to come clean about his past and his life on the streets — the truth of which could rupture a budding romance. \nBall created the drama and will executive produce alongside his Your Face Goes Here banner topper, Peter Macdissi. The project marks the fifth collaboration for Ball with HBO and its sibling cabler, Cinemax, following Six Feet Under , True Blood and Banshee . He next exec produces the Oprah Winfrey TV movie The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks . \nWilliamson is repped by Clear Talent Group and Justice and Ponder; Bean is with TalentWorks.
