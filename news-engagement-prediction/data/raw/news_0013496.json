Wrestling is about competition and goodwill through sport, and is no place for politics.” \nUSA Wrestling said on Monday the United States would send a team to Iran, where U.S. freestyle wrestlers have participated in competitions since 1998. \nNenad Lalovic, president of United World Wrestling, the sport’s international federation, said it was working towards a solution. \n“Though we had hoped for a different outcome from Iran’s Foreign Ministry, we appreciate the complex nature of this decision. We are currently working to find a solution for the Freestyle World Cup as soon as possible,” he said in a statement. \n“Despite the travel restrictions between their countries I’ve been encouraged this week by the cooperation and friendship of the Iranian Wrestling Federation and USA Wrestling. \n“As we’ve seen over the years, wrestling is a sport that unites people and nations. United World Wrestling hosts a full calendar of events every season and we’re certain to see American and Iranian wrestlers on the same mat again in the very near future.” \nTrump has adopted an aggressive stance towards Tehran since Iran’s ballistic missile test-launch, saying it was now “on notice”. The new US administration is expected to impose fresh sanctions on multiple Iranian entities. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T20:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:35:33.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
