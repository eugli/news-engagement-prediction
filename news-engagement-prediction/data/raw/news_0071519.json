Kim Kardashian \nAlong with dodgy eyebrows, light powder eyeshadow and a distinct lack of contouring, images of Kim during her 16th birthday party are a far cry from her heavily primped and preened look of today. \nBut there's no denying that she's undergone quite the transformation in the past 20 years. Further proof of this can be seen in a throwback snap posted by Nick Cannon. \nNick dated Kim between September 2006 and January 2007 - shortly before her sex tape with Ray J surfaced. The snap, with Paris Hilton, looks almost sweet and innocent. \nShe has long denied surgery, but was famously snapped undergoing a vampire facial. Khloe Kardashian \nHaving once been a chubby-cheeked brunette, there's certainly no denying that Khloe is a million miles away from her old look. \nNow boasting peroxide blonde locks and a slimmer look, she is the face - and body - of fitness brand Protein World. But she was very different aged 16, as the below snap proves. \nThe middle Kardashian sister, 31, recently shared a shot of her celebrating her grandfather's birthday - hands awkwardly by her sides, Khloe smiles at the camera as Krisâ€™ late dad turns around to look at her. \nNew-and-improved Khloe has been at the centre of a lot of speculation regarding her transforming looks, with her nose looking more raised than it did in the past. \nThe star has directly responded to the rumours this year, insisting: \"If I felt like I wanted one, I would've\". Kourtney Kardashian \nLike her sisters, Kourtney has also been caught up in the speculation after her look has dramatically changed over the years. \nAlthough she is yet to comment publicly on whether she has had work to make her nose sharper, she has opened up on getting a boob job. \nHer sister Kim also confirmed it last year when, referring to Caitlyn's breasts after her Vanity Fair photoshoot, she said: \"Her boobs were like Kourtney's... when she first got hers done.\" Kylie Jenner \nShe was once the girlish TV star who was more cute than curvaceous. But that's a distant memory for Kylie , who is now a much more grown up version of herself - with a little help. \nThe youngest of the Kardashian/Jenner fam insisted for months that her over-sized pout was purely down to changing her make-up but fans were never convinced. \nEventually, Khloe spilled the beans, saying: \"Kylie decided to plump her lips and I don't think there is anything wrong with that. I think if you've done something though, it is right to cop up to it. If you avoid the question you're gonna look like a liar.\" \nEarlier this week, Kylie's changing appearance became the target of a hilarious new meme that suggests she's only looks as good as she does because of her family's cash. Alongside a picture of her then and now, the meme reads: \"This type of puberty is called money.\" \nThe image has been shared thousands of times on social media this week, after Kylie shared a snap of herself posing in a skimpy black bikini.
