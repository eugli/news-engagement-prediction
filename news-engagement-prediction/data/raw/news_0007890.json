Their code words are said to have included 'going for a cappuccino' to mean intercourse, and obscure references to 'spreading Marmite'.\nConcerns have also been raised that the group took photographs of their activity.\nThe consultants, who have 50 years' medical experience between them, allegedly met one of the women – called 'the Madam' – when they worked at another hospital.\nSources fear the individuals carried out the activities for more than a year. One said: 'It [the behaviour] was horrendous and it would make your hair curl. You don't do things like that in a clinic, when there are patients outside. Things are very unpleasant at the minute, all down to this.'\nFurious colleagues have accused Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust of a cover-up after it emerged that the consultants were not sacked.\nThe existence of the group's activity was discovered last year after a whistleblower raised concerns. An investigation unearthed the trove of emails, which contained details about the trysts taking place in offices, clinical rooms and outside the hospital's premises.\nThe pair were suspended, but a disciplinary panel led by trust chairman Kingsley Smith and non-executive director Dr Bryan Dobson took 20 minutes to give them a formal warning. The decision, which allowed the pair to return to work with a recommendation that they receive counselling, was described as 'laughable' by one colleague at the trust. Another said it amounted to a 'slap on the wrist'.\nThe unnamed 'Madam' is understood to have left the trust before moving abroad, while the other two mystery women also left their roles.\nA trust employee said: 'If it had been anybody lower down, they would have been sacked immediately and they were just suspended and not made to resign.' They added: 'It's only because they are doctors and have a reputation and the authorities think it is too much for them to give up.'\nAnother worker said: 'The decision was against everybody's advice. They [the consultants] thought they were untouchable. If that had been a porter or a domestic, their feet wouldn't have touched the ground.'\nA source said sexual partners were 'shared' between the two consultants at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle (pictured)\nThe trust declined to hand over documents after four Freedom of Information requests were lodged, citing data protection rules.\nDespite being allowed to return to work, both consultants, who earned approximately £90,000, later resigned.\nThey came under pressure after a group of colleagues sent a letter to the General Medical Council saying they could no longer work with the pair. Although an official referral was also sent to the regulator by the trust, the GMC decided not to investigate. A source accused the GMC, which said the trysts were an isolated occurrence, of 'washing their hands' of the incident.\nA spokesman for the trust said: 'Our disciplinary procedures follow national guidelines ... Panels consider all of the evidence carefully and are independent.\n'In addition the GMC also considers matters of the medical profession and has its own independent review process.'\nMr Smith and Dr Dobson said they could not discuss the case for confidentiality reasons.
