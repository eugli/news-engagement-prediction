But Spicer and Trump did not close the door on the deal. \nOn Friday morning Australian time, Turnbull told 2SM Radio in Sydney that as prime minister he had to stand his ground and make his case for Australian interests, but he had done so privately.\nWhite House suggests US may still accept Australia refugees despite clash Read more \nTurnbull again denied that Trump had hung up on him during the pair’s 25-minute weekend phone call, saying it was a “frank discussion” that had ended “courteously”.\nAsked if Trump was a brash character, Turnbull replied: “I’ll leave others to comment on him but he’s clearly a very big personality.”\nTurnbull said Trump had given him a commitment to the refugee resettlement deal which had been “confirmed several times since”.\nOn Thursday the deal for the US to take up to 1,250 refugees from Australia’s offshore detention facilities on Manus Island and Nauru was thrown into doubt by Trump labelling it a “dumb deal” and questioning why the US was taking “thousands of illegal immigrants”. \nSpicer said the refugees would be subject to an “extreme vetting” process to ensure that they came with “peaceful intentions” and did not pose a threat to US security, indicating the resettlement deal had not been scrapped despite the president’s outrage. Australian officials remain concerned that the deal could be scrapped entirely or made effectively meaningless by the extreme vetting process. \nAustralian government ministers have tried to frame the spat as the prime minister standing up to Trump in a show of strength.\n\nAustralian defence industry minister, Christopher Pyne, told Channel Nine that the refugee resettlement agreement was “not a deal Donald Trump would have done if he had been president at the time and he obviously doesn’t like the deal”.\nTurnbull tries out shirtfronting Trump as a way to handle the bully-in-chief | Katharine Murphy Read more \nBut he added a “deal is a deal” and Turnbull had stood up for Australia’s interests in ensuring the US follows through on its commitment.\nExperts in US-Australian relations have warned Trump’s concern over the refugee resettlement deal may lead to fewer refugees reaching the US, increased demands from Trump and a decline in the US-Australia alliance.\nThe response in the US to Trump’s handling of the refugee deal focused on the wisdom of picking fights with a staunch US ally.\nChris Murphy, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, tweeted: \nChris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) I made a Top 100 Possible Trump Administration Foreign Crises list & I gotta admit \"Rupturing US-Australia Relations\" was NOT on there.\nFebruary 2, 2017 Another Democrat, congressman Ted Leiu from California, wrote:\nTed Lieu (@tedlieu) As Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee-and as an American-I find this unhinged behavior by @POTUS to PM Turnbull embarrassing & shocking https://t.co/TY3VrrZ9qZ \nFebruary 2, 2017 Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) Dear Australia: The majority of Americans who don't support Trump want to say we are sorry.

Gotta wonder what the other three are thinking.\nFebruary 2, 2017 United States Studies Centre senior fellow, Tom Switzer, told ABC News Breakfast the emphasis on “extreme vetting” may indicate a “good chunk” of the 1,250 refugees may not resettle in the US.\nSwitzer said Trump took a “transactional” approach, suggesting he may ask for more from the Turnbull government in return for sticking with the resettlement deal.\n“This controversy, although it might be resolved for now, may be a harbinger for the next four years,” he warned.\nA handy guide for Malcolm Turnbull on dealing with Donald Trump | Dominic Knight Read more \n“One thing that distinguishes Donald Trump from his post-World War II predecessors is that he places little faith in the US alliance system.”\nRepublican speaker of the house, Paul Ryan, sought to reassure Australia it should not be worried about its relationship with the US. “I know your country well, I’ve met with your leaders continuously over the last number of years,” he said.\n“So no, Australia is a very important essential ally, [and] it is going to continue to be [one].”\nSenior Republican John McCain has called the Australian ambassador to re-affirm the alliance. “This in my view was an unnecessary and frankly harmful open dispute over an issue which is not nearly as important as the US-Australian cooperation and working together,” he said.\nBut in Australia some used the Trump anger at the deal to question why Australia didn’t resettle it’s own refugees:\nChris Crouch (@thecrouchpotato) Here's a crazy idea, why doesn't Australia take the refugees\nFebruary 2, 2017 Josh Taylor (@joshgnosis) The Australian govt is very publicly learning what happens when you demonise refugees. Unfortunately again it'll be the refugees who suffer.\nFebruary 2, 2017 Spicer attempted to smooth over reports in the Washington Post that the phone call between Trump and Turnbull had been “the worst” of a round Trump had made, describing it as “cordial”.\nMinority leader of the house, Nancy Pelosi, said the US-Australian relationship was strong and she would also contact the ambassador to express support.\n“I’m hoping that the later characterisations of the call are really what stands between our two countries,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:31:34.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
