But to help define the line between suspicion and straight up wild paranoia, a recent Ask Reddit thread probed people who've been in the unfortunate position of being cheated on to reveal the signs that tipped them off to the lying. Here are 10 signs they noticed before finding out their partners weren't being as faithful as they said they were. 1. \"I got mailed a wedding invitation by his fiancé of four years.\" \"I got mailed a wedding invitation by his fiancé of four years that I had thought was just a good friend of his. That was not only a clear-cut sign he was cheating, but that I was the other woman and in second place.\" — Cursethewind 2. \"I suspected that him talking on the phone in the driveway for a half hour each night after she went to bed was not business-related.\" \"My dad wasn't my partner, but I busted him for cheating on my mother when I suspected that him talking on the phone in the driveway for a half hour each night after she went to bed was not business-related. I don't even know if I should have done that; the marriage ended.\" — Phlox_carolina 3. \"Fearful of any lasting evidence of the relationship.\" \"I was with someone for many years, and was blissfully unaware she had been cheating on me for an extended time. A number of months before she left me for one of her other guys, she stopped wanting to take pictures of us together. This was in the days of film cameras, and I didn't pick up on this sudden change in behavior, because I hate having my picture taken and thought she was finally respecting my opinion, as well as saving a lot of money. Despite that, I suggested we get a portrait done of us together, as I was planning on asking her to marry me, and thought it would be nice to have. I still clearly remember her telling me she thought it wasn't a good idea, because \"what if we ever split up?\" It blew my mind, but I had some horrible stuff going on in my life that was distracting me. After she broke up with me she told any mutual acquaintances that we'd been together for only a year, not almost six as we really had been, and pointed to a lack of pictures as proof I was a crazy ex obsessed with her. It never occurred to her that people who knew us all those years would be willing to say that we had been together for years, or that I still had pictures from our years together.

Apparently she planned to control my dating life after she dumped me.\" — OfficePsycho 4. \"They frequently accused me of cheating.\" \"Every relationship I had that ended because I found out they were cheating had one common denominator: They frequently accused me of cheating. Like, all the time. I have never cheated. For example, my last ex accused me of making plans to go cheat on them with an actor from TV. I didn't even know the actor's real name, I just thought the actor was cute. Cue huge fight. Find out later they've been cheating on me with just a friend, don't worry . Five years later the ridiculousness of it still strikes me from time to time.\" — PetticoatBandit 5. \"Lying about where they are.\" \"I think, in my life, I am five to one in this category. Six times in my life, a SO has lied about where they were. Five times, they were cheating. The other time, they were picking out a Valentine's gift for me.\" — sericatus 6. \"Long periods of time in which you cannot account for their whereabouts.\" \"And when they do tell you where they have been, they tell you a detailed story, in which they progressively fill in the details because it is a lie. Sad!\" — 35palas12 7. \"Never saved phone numbers into his phone.\" \"My high school boyfriend never saved phone numbers into his phone. He claimed he was just \"too lazy.\" Turns out the unsaved numbers belonged to his many many side girls.\" — Ashbrincon Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 8. \"He would tell me I wasn't putting the effort into our relationship, but when I tried to be more attentive and loving, he would withdraw.\" \"I could tell he was growing increasingly distant. He would tell me I wasn't putting the effort into our relationship, but when I tried to be more attentive and loving, he would withdraw. And then one awesome night, I asked him if there was someone else. He had a panic attack [that] left him unable to breathe, and his uncle [and I] rushed him to the ER. For two weeks after, he would send me pictures of the toll the attack had taken on his eyes and skin. I felt like a monster.

The worst part is that his whole family knew and had been helping him hide it because they thought I was an awful person due to some lies he had been feeding them. His uncle was paying for the secret cell phone. Everyone was encouraging him to leave me for her, not knowing I had been paying the majority of the household expenses and had been doing everything I could think of to make him happy. When I found out and asked why, he said I just didn't love him enough.\" — alloutofdietcoke 9. \"Being extra careful with phone content.\" \"My ex even dared me to check his phone because I was complaining about him always checking mine. I made a show of perusing his folders and I found a folder full of one person's messages. I think he even used a neutral/guy name. At that point my woman intuition was itching ever so slightly, so I joked that I'd call the number. He said to go ahead. So I called the number but he still had that smug, confident look on his face. Someone picked up on the other line and I recognized it to be my previous editor-in-chief from my university pub. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below My ex started to lose it when I said 'hello.' He [couldn't] grab his phone so he made sure that my former EIC heard my name so she [wouldn't] talk anymore. I should've thrown his phone to the wall! Aah... Missed opportunities. TL:DR; Putting them in a single folder and passing them off as messages from a dude won't cut it. My ex was an amateur.\" — kabudelz07 10. \"A sudden increase in sexual desire towards you.\" \"Having a new sexual partner makes you feel sexier and hornier. They might be getting it from someone else, but out of guilt and convenience, they'll likely be more sexual towards you as well, in ways they weren't before.\" — imnogoodatthisorthat Follow Hannah on Twitter .
