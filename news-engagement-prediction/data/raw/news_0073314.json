I feel like I’m hated everywhere and I thought she’d hate me. \n“And I just I felt 'why would she wanna stare at a murderer'. \n“I know I’ve caused a lot of pain, for a lot of people with something that could have waited til the next day. \n\"I know that. I know what I’ve done, I know the lives I’ve ruined ,yeah. I’ve ruined a lot of people’s lives, happiness, and I deserve everything I get from whatever comes now, hate, anger… \n\"I am sorry but I can’t keep saying sorry cos I know people don’t wanna hear it – you can only just – sorry’s not gonna make things better I know.” \nIn the emotionally charged meeting – screened on BBC Inside Out South tonight – Gavin's girlfriend asks Stratford what he was rowing with his girlfriend about on the fateful night and what injuries he suffered.

He was just minding his own business that night and I just…do you know? That’s what I think about all the time – I try and think what the other car, what he must have seen. \n“I dunno, I hate to – I just wanted to know, did you say he was just going to work? – He was just going to work. It just makes me feel horrible. \n“I don’t wanna like go on about them because they’re nothing compared to what happened but I had a leg, I broke this left leg and I mean I tore my aorta, had a stent fitted and that and some internal injuries that they had to put me in a coma to keep me breathing because my lungs were quite squashed. \n“My auntie’s told me that I took off my oxygen mask and said to her it was my fault. I kept saying it was my fault, it was my fault. \n“They didn’t tell me what had happened but I knew I was in trouble, cos the police were bringing my stuff from the car in the bags.” Meg arrives to meet Lewis Stratford (Photo: BBC) Read More Transport secretary wages war on mobile phone users behind the wheel as he backs Mirror campaign \nMeg had been due to go on a dream holiday with Gavin to meet his parents in Australia before he was killed and described seeing him in hospital. \nShe said: \"I got to the hospital just after 8 o’clock and they let me in straight away to see him and I went in and sat next to him and he was just completely connected with tubes and monitors and I just remember sitting next to him begging him, praying for him to wake up – I’d give anything – I’d have swapped places with him. \n\"The consultant took the family into the room and told them there was nothing they could do and I just remember my legs completely giving in. \n\"I remember my mum grabbing hold of me and walking me through the intensive care unit and it genuinely felt like a dream – it felt like I was watching it happen to somebody else. \n\"And as I stood up I kissed him on his forehead and told him it was ok to go. I told him not to be scared and that he could still look after me.\" \nStratford asked Meg if she is angry with him and she replied: “A little bit…but then so many people do it, so many people, but it was a stupid mistake. \n“I don’t wanna hate you forever, I’m not that type of person and eventually I’ll probably be able to forgive you but I just needed some questions answering first.” Lewis Straford is to be jailed for death by dangerous driving (Photo: BBC) Read More Man dragged along road by speeding car after trying to stop dog snatcher 'stealing his new puppy' \nSpeaking about how people perceive him, Stratford, who said he still has nightmares about the crash, said: “I accept I'm a stupid idiot. I’m not a murderer, that’s one comment I won’t accept because I didn’t mean it. \n“And I didn’t mean to end his life. \n“Every time I look at my phone I don’t wanna, I just look at this phone and I’m thinking, I don’t, I can’t wanna answer it every time and if I could live without a phone I would as well. \n“I wouldn’t use a phone again. I won’t ever drive again. Ever.” \nAsked by Meg if he has a message for anyone thinking of picking up their mobile while driving he said: “Don’t do it cos picking up a phone, no matter how nice you are or how good you, are accidents like this can happen to anyone on the road by using a phone. \n“Something I gotta learn for, something I gotta pay the price for and I will learn from it.” \nBBC Inside Out South tonight on BBC One, 7.30pm and on iPlayer for the next 30 days Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T18:57:29.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
