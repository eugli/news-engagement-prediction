Make sure you're in the loop â€” take five seconds to sign up for our FREE Vols newsletter now!) \n\"We are really excited for Zach and his family,\" Tennessee coach Butch Jones said in a press release. \" I have known Zach for a long time and this is a path he has wanted to pursue for some time. \n\"We can't thank him enough for his loyalty, dedication and hard work over the past four years to our football program.\" \nIt's been an offseason of coaching turnover on the Tennessee staff, with Azzanni's departure being the sixth change since the 2016 football season ended. \nOffensive coordinator Mike DeBord left for the same position at Indiana, eventually replaced internally by Larry Scott, who was elevated from tight ends coach and special teams coordinator. \nDefensive backs coach Willie Martinez was let go and offensive line coach Don Mahoney didn't have his contract renewed. Defensive line coach Steve Stripling moved to an off-field role for the Vols, as director of football program development. \nFormer Michigan head coach and Oregon defensive coordinator Brady Hoke replaced Stripling as defensive line coach. Walt Wells, an offensive quality control assistant at Tennessee last season, working with the offensive line, replaced Mahoney. \nCharlton Warren was hired away from North Carolina to replace Martinez and Mike Canales left Utah State to become Tennessee's quarterbacks coach. \nAzzanni has been on staff with the Vols since 2013, coaching wide receivers and also serving as recruiting coordinator (2013-14) and pass-game coordinator (2015-16). \nJones hired Azzanni away from Wisconsin in 2013, after previous stops at Florida, Western Kentucky, Central Michigan, Bowling Green and Valparasio. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
