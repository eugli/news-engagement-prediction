Source: Tweet \nChris Harold scored his second goal of the season - courtesy of a deflection off Wanderers defender Robert Cornthwaite - on the cusp on half-time before substitute Joel Chianese sealed the result in the 94th minute. \nThe gutsy win extended Glory's unbeaten streak to four matches, lifting the club ahead of both Melbourne City and Brisbane Roar with six rounds to play before the finals. FULL TIME | @PerthGloryFC move up into THIRD in the Hyundai #ALeague table! #PERvWSW pic.twitter.com/eK16yQxGXi \nâ€” Hyundai A-League (@ALeague) February 25, 2017 \nWestern Sydney coach Tony Popovic made eight changes to the side which lost 4-0 to Japanese club Urawa in their opening match of the Asian Champions League on Tuesday, with only Scott Neville, Jumpei Kusukami and goalkeeper Vedran Janjetovic backing up in the Perth heat. \nThe Wanderers, who play Shanghai SIPG in China on Tuesday, remain sixth on the ladder, two points ahead of Wellington Phoenix. \nReigning Johnny Warren medallist Diego Castro turned in another class performance, regularly running circles around the Wanderers defence and having a hand in both of Glory's goals. \nMost of Glory's chances fell in the first half, but Kenny Lowe's side were denied by some brilliant saves from Janjetovic. \nAdam Taggart and Rostyn Griffiths both had shots blocked on the line, while at the other end of the pitch Terry Antonis saw his free kick crash off the crossbar. \nJanjetovic also made a diving save to his left to prevent Rhys Williams scoring his first goal for Perth. \nWilliams moved into the midfield midway through the first half when Brandon Wilson was forced off with a back injury, with Aryn Williams filling the void left by his older brother at centre-back. \nGlory was unlucky not to be awarded two penalties for handballs inside the box as half-time approach, with referee Jonathan Barreiro ruling Shannon Cole and Brendon Santalab did not have cases to answer. \nHarold then struck in first-half stoppage time, volleying home a clever Castro cross from outside the box off Cornthwaite's boot. Victory too stong for Reds in Melbourne Melbourne Victory have continued their surge toward the A-League finals, surviving a late scare from last-placed Adelaide United to claim a 2-1 victory. \nDino Djulbic almost doubled Glory's lead shortly after half-time, but his powerful header hit the side-netting. \nChianese iced the victory after capitalising on another piece of Castro brilliance with less than a minute before the final whistle.
