With the winter transfer window now firmly shut, the Bundesliga is now loaded with fantastic talents and players who will further spice up the games and give fans exciting football action and experience as the biggest clubs and names battle for the ultimate title. Victor Osimhen \nAlexander Isak, Bojan KrKic, Neven Subotic and Nigerian Victor Osimhen are among the most promising and biggest transfers of the winter transfer period who will rock the 2016/17 Rückrunde. Already adding punch to an increasingly enthralling Bundesliga campaign, many of the division’s biggest winter transfer movers are proving shrewd acquisitions to their respective sides. Across the division, the new faces have been tasked with igniting the hopes or reviving the fortunes of Bundesliga teams brimming with ambition. \n17-year old Swedish striker Isak is sure a great buy for eight-time German champions, Borussia Dortmund and would be a fans delight any day. Regarded as the long-term successor to Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Isak recently became Sweden’s youngest-ever goalscorer and has scored 10 goals and picked up one assist in 24 league games for Solna so far this season. \nNigerian teenage striker Victor Osimhen and the returning Ashkan Dejagah will also add colour. The 18 year old striker has been tipped to add great spice to VfL Wolfsburg squad. \nNigerian fans can enjoy all the football action and entertainment live and exclusively on StarTimes football channels, including ST World Football (channel 245 or 254), ST Sports Premium (channel 246 or 252) and ST Sports Focus, said StarTimes Head of Public Relations, Israel Bolaji. \nBolaji said StarTimes has lined up an exciting mix of live football games every weekend for maximum viewing pleasure of sports loving subscribers, armed with exclusive broadcast rights to Bundesliga, Serie A, ligue One, Chinese league as well as select EPL games.
