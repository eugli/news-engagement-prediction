Most Popular By Kaitlyn Greenidge Feb 13, 2017 Two days before Valentine's Day and two nights after the full moon eclipse in Leo, Beyoncé Knowles Carter took the stage at the Grammys and led her audience through a mass invocation of the fertility goddess. Some fickle watchers called the performance slow or pretentious. They have grown used to the excellence of Beyoncé and whined for something new. But anyone whose business it is to create things knew that they were watching something ancient and strange. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \"It's the largest invocation of Inanna\"—the ancient Sumerian goddess of fertility, beauty, love, creativity, and knowledge—\"we've had in modern times,\" my friend Kerry wrote back to me when I sent her an excited email (all caps and exclamation points) about the performance. Kerry is a translator. She is translating the Song of Songs, the sexiest Book of the Bible, the one that probably began as hymns to a love goddess, its verses providing the blueprint for every love ballad and R&B slow jam right up to present day Beyoncé singing \"Pink in the middle/it's a riddle.\" \"We need this right now,\" Kerry writes to me, and I can't help but agree. Inanna Getty Most Popular Innana is the female deity given the most power. She wears a golden headdress and carries a lapis lazuli measuring rod. She is the only god to have visited the underworld, where she passed through seven gates, shedding each part of her glorious costume until she arrived before her sister, the wife of death, naked. Inanna cannot leave the underworld, is transformed into a corpse, and is only brought back to life through the help of the god of knowledge. But someone must take her place in the underworld—it won't be her loyal female handmaiden or her male beautician. It will be her lazy shiftless husband who did not mourn her at all. Brushing up on the myth this morning, I thought of how the gifts of beauty and knowledge and theater could be what helps save us, the gifts of the female and the queer, that are so denigrated by the wider world. Beyoncé's performance, tilting chair and handmaidens, referenced all of this. We are at a moment in time when the feminine and the queer are excluded from power, when political power is based on how boldly and angrily you can denounce both groups. To have this performance, an overflowing of devotion to the feminine divine, to a knowledge that comes from the position of subjugation, to the fancifully inefficient and the gaudily adorned, is monumental. \nThe Grammys, in the past, have hosted hyper masculine tantrums of male pop stars. Lemonade , of course, with its images of water, was basically a lyrical offering to the goddess Oshun, the Yoruba and Vodun goddess of love and creativity, as well as a celebration of her iconography, with her army of female followers. Pop music at its heart traffics in symbols—the little red corvette, the cherry pie, the moon and the hearts and the flowers and rain. At its most pedestrian, these symbols become clichés—lyrics that sound like a love-struck teen's diary. At their best, they tap into images and myths that have always lurked in our cultural subconscious—purple rain and an ocean of violets in bloom and, for Beyoncé, moving mountains as she sings in \"Love Drought.\" But perhaps if not more important than the symbolism of her performance was the stage on which it took place. The Grammys, in the past, have hosted hypermasculine tantrums of male pop stars, from Kanye all the way back to Guns N Roses. Last night, the ceremony was reclaimed for femininity, for love, for romance, for a version of sex outside the capitalist imagination—sex not as transaction or a play for power, but as a sacred rite, a way to repair. \"If we are to heal,\" Beyoncé said in her acceptance speech, \"Let it be glorious.\" We are living in strange times. Today I read that the National Security Council is at war with itself, tilting the whole world closer to danger. If we enter nuclear holocaust at least we will have these relics from our goddess Beyoncé to help us find new myths and remake the world with our forgotten goddesses of love.
