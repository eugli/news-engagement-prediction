How far away are we from recovery in demand? Do you see further PE expansion from the current level? \n\nDemand has never been under question in our country which is home to about 1.3 billion people. With a majority of aspiring and energetic young people, we don't have any option but to grow. Decades of political mismanagement had left our economy in dire straits. Today, for the first time since Independence, we have a strong central leadership with a vision. Looking at a few months of statistics to evaluate a great nation's prospects is myopic. With clearer and big-picture vision, the quality of future earnings in India could be better than ever before. \n\nIs 2017 a good year for equities? How much more upside can one expects from the Indian markets by December? \n\nEvery year in my 27 years of investing career has been good for equities, and 2017 won't be any different. Forget about Sensex and Nifty.Go out and pick stocks. There are several potential multi-baggers out there waiting to be grabbed by smart stock pickers. \nHow do you pick multi-baggers? \n\nMulti-baggers cannot be picked; they evolve. When you invest in 10 potential multi-bagger ideas, two or three of them will really make it big, while one or two may fail. That is how it works. What is more important is keeping your eyes and ears open to ideas and grabbing the opportunity when it arrives. \n\nYou recently said that TCI, HSIL, Tata Global, FCL and GIC Housing are your favourites. Are these stocks still a good buy? \n\nIn fact, I was suggesting investors look for some great businesses, where the stock price has either declined or been stagnant in 2016, instead of running after fancied and performing stocks. TCI, HSIL & Tata Global are looking good though they have moved up recently. I have been holding them. \n\nSome of the stocks from retail businesses have rallied on the back of the D-Mart IPO . Is there a good entry point in retail names now? \n\nI have been bullish on Future Group stocks since last year. I am betting on the dynamism and vision of Mr Kishore Biyani and prospects of business model; this has nothing to do with D-Mart IPO. Of course DMart will do very well, Mr Radhakrishnan Damani, an old friend from BSE days, as we know, has the vision and wisdom to make it much bigger. \n\nYou are also bullish on holding companies. Which do you reckon are good bets among holding stocks? \n\nMost of them have moved up recently, still leaving unsustainably huge gap between price and value.BBTC, Bengal Assam & Vindhya Telelink are some of the large businesses in the segment for investors to watch and buy during any potential weakness in the market . \n\nWhich are the new themes post demonetisation --sectors or stocks -that look attractive? \n\nDemonetisation is the single most important economic reform India has seen after liberalisation and was a right step towards levelling the economic playing field. I was bullish on stocks and sectors temporarily beaten down due to demonetisation fears. With more and more results coming out it is turning out to be a non-event as far as listed companies are concerned. With demonetisation and GST, organised businesses will do better going forward. Listed companies are supposed to be `organised' businesses. Some of the small and mid-cap companies, which have traditionally been managed unprofessionally, will turn `white' and professional going forward Â¬ a segment from which investors could pick multi-baggers.
