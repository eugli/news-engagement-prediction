I never thought something like that would happen to one of my closest classmates Nicole, friend of the victim \nSPCC student Andrea said Ko was part of the school’s Harmonica Ensemble, which will now have to compete without Ko. \n“I feel very sorry for what happened,” she said. “The other Harmonica Ensemble members told her to stay behind, so I hope she doesn’t feel guilty that she can’t compete [with them]. I hope she’s feeling better.” \n“The school principal, teachers and students are deeply saddened by this incident, and want to express their sincere gratitude for the outpouring of support for Audrey Ko,” SPCC said in a statement on Monday. “Ko suffered heavy wounds to her legs during the incident and is undergoing steady recovery, and we hope she will be transferred to an ordinary hospital ward soon.” \nSPCC launched a crisis management team to assist and support students affected by the incident, and will hold a prayer session to support Ko. Student organisations will also collect words of support for a card that will be delivered to Ko. \nThe SPCC Music Department posted on Facebook on Saturday: “Our prayers are with you ... our prayers should also be with the suspect who himself is a victim of an illness.” \nMany of Ko’s classmates were still in shock as they returned to school on Monday morning – their first time back since the incident. \nForm Four student Nicole, who has known Ko for three years, said they were in the same class and she has been on school trips with her. \n“I feel really upset because I never thought something like that would happen to one of my closest classmates,” she said. \nMan charged with arson after Hong Kong MTR attack leaves 19 commuters injured \nOn Sunday, a classmate visited Ko in hospital, bringing a card with messages from some of her friends. \nMembers of the public also delivered a card with the message “Little sister, recover soon,” along with a flower basket. \nMeanwhile, the suspect was absent from his first court hearing as he remained in hospital on Monday. \nKowloon City Court adjourned the case for three working days, but ordered that Cheung Kam-fai be brought to court at the earliest time, if he was discharged before Friday. He faces one count of arson with intent. \nFrancis Li Shing-kee, the MTR’s chief of operating, said the initial investigation into the attack, which left at least 19 people injured, will take two months to complete. \n“We will review how the [incident] was handled and whether any improvements would be needed for the future,” Li said on a radio show on Monday morning. \nHe said a list of the members of the high-level investigation panel would be announced as soon as possible. \nWhile half of the existing MTR trains, including the one in Friday’s incident, are not fitted with CCTV, Li said the panel would also review whether cameras could be installed on older model trains. \nMore than 80 per cent of trains will be installed with CCTV after a new batch of trains is introduced next year. \nWhile lawmaker Michael Tien Puk-sun earlier said that MTR staff were not able to react promptly due to lack of surveillance on the train, Li said the train captain’s response was carried out according to standard procedures. \n“The captain already knew there was an emergency and he had to drive the train to Tsim Sha Tsui station. The [response] would not [have been much different] if there was CCTV,” Li said. \nMeanwhile, Dr Chan Chung-mau, chairman of the Hong Kong Association for the Promotion of Mental Health, suggested that the city should consider implementing mandatory community treatment order to mental illness patients who did not visit doctors on time. \n“Hong Kong could implement such order based on our needs and resources. I think it should be done for the sake of overall mental health [policy],” said Chan on the same radio show. \nHe said many developed countries such as the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom were already doing this to prevent symptoms of psychiatric patients deteriorating.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:55:13.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
