You are the front line of defence for the president and his administration, often taking the incoming heat from reporters day after day because, well, that's the job. There's a reason, after all, that a flak jacket is your ceremonial welcome gift. \nSo, Sean Spicer, President Trump's press secretary, knew what he was getting into when he took the position. But there's no way he could have known it would be this bad.

More videos Sean Spicer responds to SNL skit \nMelissa McCarthy's SNL impression of the press secretary has gone viral, and Sean Spicer gives his reaction to the skit to a Fox News reporter. \nSpicer is taking the usual slings and arrows from reporters. And he has been spoofed — brilliantly — on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Neither of those things have made his job miserable, however. That honour goes to the constant leaking out of the White House that suggests Trump is less than enamoured with how Spicer looks, how he sounds and how he is doing the job. \nThe latest piece of friendly fire came Tuesday night from CNN in a piece headlined: \" White House ramping up search for communications director after Spicer's rocky start .\" There's a bunch of brutal quotes in the piece. Here's a sampling: Related Content Sean Spicer says SNL should stop being 'mean' after hilarious skit \n* White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus \"vouched for Spicer and against Trump's instincts. The president 'regrets it every day and blames Priebus,' \" one source close to the hiring process told CNN's Jim Acosta. \n* \"Multiple sources have told CNN that Spicer was not Trump's first choice for press secretary. White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway was offered the position but turned it down.\" Advertisement \n* \"A source familiar with internal communications said President Donald Trump is disappointed in Spicer's performance during the first two weeks of the administration.\" \nIt's a rough read. Particularly when you consider that a) Spicer has been on the job for just a few weeks and b) this is far from the first story in which Trump's dissatisfaction with Spicer has been made plain.
