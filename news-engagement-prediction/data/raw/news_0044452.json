By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published:  31 PM Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan. (PTI) \nOdisha Panchayat Elections 2017: Though the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) is leading the Panchayat polls in Odisha, the BJP is making more headlines owing to its improved performance. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continued its remarkable performance in the fourth phase of Odisha Panchayat elections, emerging as the main opposition to the ruling BJD in the state. However, Biju Janata Dal (BJD) continued to maintain its lead. Surely, the ‘2014 Modi waves’ have touched the coastal state once again thereby pushing the Congress to third position. The saffron brigade’s improved performance comes as a jolt to Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik’ BJD that clean swept the Panchayat Polls last time in 2012. \nIn the fourth phase, the BJP has managed to win 62 Zilla Parishad seats out of a total of 162 seats. Leaders BJD won 84 Zilla Parishad seats, while the Congress won a mere 7 seats. Polling in Nayagarh district has been postponed following the death of Kailash Sahu, who stood as an independent candidate. In all, the BJP has managed to win 243 Zilla Parishad seats out of 698 seats. This is an immense improvement for BJP as they managed to win only 36 seats in 2012, reports india.com. \nInterestingly, the Congress has further reduced to 48 seats as cmpared to 126 in their last try. Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today expressed his gratitude to the people of Odisha for their unprecedented support to the BJP which is closely following the ruling BJD in the ongoing three-tier Panchayat polls at the end of the 4th phase polls on Sunday. \nYou may also like to watch this video : \nAfter the culmination of the 4th phase of elections on Sunday, Union Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan today expressed his gratitude to the people of Odisha for coming out to vote heavily in the Panchayat elections and trusting BJP by lending out their unprecedented support. \nAddressing a media conference in Bhubaneswar, he told OTV, that the current trend is clearly reflecting people’s antipathy for BJD which is gradually losing ground.
