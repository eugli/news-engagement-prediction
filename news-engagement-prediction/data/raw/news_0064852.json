All but one complained of false positive results. \nRebecca, a designer from Hyde , said: “We already have a toddler and would have been happy to have another child. \n“But there would be health implications with the contraception I’m on so it was also a worry. Reviews of Asda's own-brand pregnancy tests \n“I dread to think how many other women have been devastated by this. Despite my complaints to Asda it’s now four months later and they haven’t given me a proper explanation or a refund.” \nRebecca took the £9.50 digital test - which comes with a promise of 99pc accuracy - when her period was late last November.

A follow-up Clear Blue test was negative. Reviews on the website for the Asda pregnancy test \nJust to make sure, she carried out a third Asda test the following day, and again it was positive. \nConcerned the hospital may have got it wrong, she returned to the unit, where a blood test and scan confirmed she was not - and never had been - pregnant. \nShe added: “The Asda test instructions say they pick up HCG levels of 10mIU/ml or above, but my result was three, so I never should have had a positive result.” Read More Watch the moment Storm Doris nearly blows over two people walking down the street \n“This caused me a lot of worries and health concerns.” \nRebecca complained to Asda and waited weeks for a response, which came in a letter denying any fault and suggesting ‘the health of the user and the way the kits are used’ could impact the result. \nUnsatisfied with this response, Rebecca has replied with a raft of questions on January 24, and is yet to receive a reply. \nAsda has been approached for comment.
