David Unwin/Fairfax NZ. \nOne of several large trucks to cross the double yellow lines on the gorge while Stuff was monitoring. \nShirley said drifting across double lines and excessive cellphone use were often reported by truck drivers and captured by webcams on the trucks. \nREAD MORE: \nA motorist cuts across the double yellow lines on the dangerous Manawatu Gorge. \n\"These are typical behaviours you see every day. \n\"Truck drivers are exposed to some appalling driving. New Zealand driving habits are far from desired.\" \nHe advocated a higher standard of driver licence and tougher penalties for those caught breaking the law. supplied \nA campervan was seen crossing the yellow lines in the Manawatu Gorge repeatedly. \n\"We need better education and the harder policing.\" Ad Feedback \nBut truckers were not above straying across the centre lines when Stuff monitored driver habits at two positions on the gorge on Tuesday. \nOver 40 minutes, 15 vehicles crossed the double yellow lines, about half of which were large trucks, and one vehicle was a St John health shuttle. \nCentral District highway patrol Senior Sergeant Kris Burbery said double yellow lines were on the gorge road for a reason and people had to abide by the law. \n\"In the Manawatu Gorge, or other similar roads, the idea is we want to restrict people from attempting to overtake and also ensure they keep to the left of the centre line. \n\"When people start crossing over the centre line, that's when the risk increases.\" \nBurbery said in the past they had run operations targeting driving in the gorge. \n\"That's had some great results and that was a result of complaints as well as crashes where people were cutting corners.\" \nIf they received more complaints of driving through the gorge, like what was displayed in the images provided, he said they would look at running another operation. \nHis plea to motorists was to recognise the risks. \n\"It's a road on the side of a cliff above a river and it requires complete attention when someone is driving through there. \n\"It's when people's attention drifts onto something else or they become casual ... you start putting other people at risk.\" \nAnyone who witnessed dangerous driving should inform police, he said. \nAA road safety spokesman Dylan Thomsen said following the road rules should be common sense. \n\"You shake your head sometimes about having to remind people [about] things that are such common sense like always wearing a seat belt and driving on the correct side of the road.\" \nThe toughest question was working out how to help improve the issue and Thomsen said there were some things people could do. \n\"People, if they are in the car behind a vehicle crossing the centre line, their options are limited. They can sound their horn, they can flash their lights, call star 555 and also pull back.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:19:10.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
