Daniel Holtzclaw attended his sentencing hearing in January 2016. CREDIT: AP Photo/Sue Ogrock Former Oklahoma City officer Daniel Holtzclaw was found guilty of serially raping black women in 2015 and sentenced to 263 years behind bars last year, but his family still refuses to acknowledge his guilt. This month, relatives launched a fundraising campaign for the HoltzclawTrial, an investigative podcast that will “go in-depth and dig deeper” into the convicted rapist’s case with the hopes of freeing him. According to a GoGetFunding campaign posted on February 7, the bi-weekly “audio and video podcast” will be hosted by private investigator Brian Bates, who worked with Holtzclaw’s defense team. Bates will release “behind-the-scenes discovery material, interviews, and audio recordings of the accusers,” and the family asked for $4,000 for production equipment. So far, 33 supporters have donated $4,870. In 2014 and 2015, 13 black women from Oklahoma City, including a 17-year-old girl, accused Holtzclaw of “rape, sexual battery and forcible oral sodomy.” The officer was charged with 36 separate counts and found guilty of 18 of them by an all-white jury . Even before the trial began, Oklahoma City Police Chief Bill Citty admitted that Holtzclaw preyed on black women with criminal histories . “Traffic stops, some of the individuals were actually just walking,” Citty explained. “Walking in their neighborhood and they were stopped, you know, searched, threatened in some way with arrest or something to that extent. And as a result of that, actually coerced them into providing sexual favors to him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:05:25.016+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
