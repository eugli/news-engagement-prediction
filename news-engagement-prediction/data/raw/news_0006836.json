Love ( The People vs. Larry Flynt ) will star as Kitty Menendez. \nLifetime says the movie's focus will reveal the \"extreme abuse the brothers endured at their father's hands, while their mother looked the other way.\" Here's the official description: In the months that followed the murders, Lyle and Erik spent their inheritance lavishly, adding to investigators' suspicions that they were involved in the parents’ deaths. After months of guilt consumed Erik, he confessed to the murders to his psychologist, leading to the eventual arrests of him and older brother Lyle. Their trial became a national sensation as the public devoured court testimony and the brothers testified that the murders were driven by a lifetime of sexual abuse by their father. After a mistrial and deadlocked jury, the brothers were later retried and convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole. Erik and Lyle remain in prison today, where they're serving their time in separate prisons, nearly 30 years since murdering their parents.\" Casting is currently under way for Lyle and Erik. Production will begin in February in Vancouver. \nThe Lifetime TV movie marks the latest scripted treatment for the Menendez brothers. NBC is also teaming with Law & Order mastermind Dick Wolf for Law & Order: True Crime — The Menendez Brothers , an eight-episode anthology drama whose first season will focus on the brothers. \nIt's also the latest true-crime TV movie for Lifetime, which also had Who Killed JonBenet , about the mysterious death of the child beauty queen. That was one of multiple scripted and unscripted properties exploring JonBenet Ramsey. \nTrue crime continues to be a hot genre for broadcast, cable, premium networks and streaming services following the success of HBO's The Jinx, FX's People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story and Netflix's Making a Murderer , among others. \nLove, repped by UTA, also counts episodes of Empire, Revenge and Sons of Anarchy among her TV credits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:35:10.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
