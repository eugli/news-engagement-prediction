Megyn Kelly \n“ She broke ground as the first black female `Today Show’ cohost and was enjoying ratings success alongside Al Roker during the show's third hour of programming. NBC has been a leader for diversity in broadcasting, but recent reports that Hall and Roker will be replaced by former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly are being seen by industry professionals as whitewashing.” \nNBC News insiders said that Hall was livid when she learned that the 9 a.m. hour of “Today” that she co-hosts with weatherman Al Roker would be bumped. \nKelly is expected to take over either the 9 a.m. hour or the 10 a.m. hour currently hosted by Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb - who would move to a different timeslot.
