High, is studying aviation management.\n‚ÄúAbout six times I have flown. I love it,‚Äù Brahms said. ‚ÄúIt was pretty exhilarating the first time flying up there and seeing everything. I saw the stadium from the air and that was cool.‚Äù\nBrahms enrolled in Auburn in January. Jeffrey Lee/AuburnSports.com Brahms, 6-foot-4 and 280 pounds, suffered a broken leg during preseason practice last August. He‚Äôs continued his rehab since arriving at Auburn but is not expected to be cleared for full contact for a few more months.\n‚ÄúI think he‚Äôll be ready to go in the summer,‚Äù Auburn coach Gus Malzahn said.\nWhen Brahms does return, Auburn will get a physical offensive guard or center that showed a knack for finishing blocks.\n‚ÄúVery tough-type guy that brings a physical presence. I think he has a chance to be a very good player,‚Äù Malzahn said.\nBrahms, the son of an airline pilot, finished high school with a GPA above 4.0, but has a bit of a nasty streak on the field.\n‚ÄúI would say I‚Äôm physical,‚Äù Brahms said. ‚ÄúI think I have fast feet and I use that to my advantage. I would say I‚Äôm pretty strong in the weight room so that correlates as well too.‚Äù\nAuburn begins spring practice Feb. 28.\nüé• | Watch highlights from newly added offensive lineman @Nick_Brahms . #WarEagle | #AUNSD17 pic.twitter.com/PaZXoYwMAX\n‚Äî Auburn Football (@AuburnFootball) February 1, 2017 Edit", "external_links": ["https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/kh60uyelvve9vy0anqod", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/WarEagle?src=hash", "https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/kh60uyelvve9vy0anqod)", "https://t.co/PaZXoYwMAX", "https://twitter.com/AuburnFootball/status/826766481836953600", "https://twitter.com/Nick_Brahms", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/AUNSD17?src=hash"], "published": "2017-02-21T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:11:21.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
