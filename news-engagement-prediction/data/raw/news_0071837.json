(Photo: Phantom Open Emoji) \nIn a party-line vote Republicans in the Arizona Senate approved a bill that, essentially, would force you to stay home and shut up.\nOtherwise, you’d risk getting criminally prosecuted and losing everything. \nSo much for democracy.\nThey call it an anti-rioting bill but it’s actually and anti-free speech bill. An anti-any-opposition bill. A stay-home-and-shut-up bill.\nIt should creep you out. It should make you sick.\nSB 1142 would expand state laws meant to combat racketeering to include rioting.\nI’ve written about this earlier. \nThe bill is sponsored by Republican Sen. Sonny Borrelli would have organizers and protesters of an event that gets out of hand charged with conspiracy and racketeering (for which they could be held criminally and financially liable). The ridiculously broad proposal would allow organizers and bystanders to be prosecuted even if they had nothing to do with any actual crime.\nUnder existing law a person already can be prosecuted for criminal damage or assault or rioting. A new law is not necessary. Unless punishing rioters is not really its purpose. And it’s not.\nThe real purpose of a law like this would be to frighten law-abiding citizens into not attending public demonstrations, for fear they might get arrested.\nThe idea is based on a completely unproven claim about paid protesters causing trouble.\nAs Democratic Sen. Katie Hobbs said before the senate vote, “This idea that people are being paid to come out and do that? I’m sorry, but I think that is fake news.”\nBecause it is.\nBecause there is no proof.\nBut that doesn’t seem to matter. The idea is to frighten people into not exercising their free speech or their constitutionally-protected right to assemble, to voice their grievances.\nImagine that.\nAmericans claiming to protect the American way by silencing Americans.\nWhen the bill earlier passed through committee (also on a party-line vote) Kevin Heade, a Phoenix defense attorney and member of Arizona Attorneys for Criminal Justice, said, “This is an extremely broad statute, and we have not heard any justification for why it’s necessary.”\nI said then that you won’t ever hear any justification. And you won’t.\nBecause the whole idea behind this is to keep people quiet.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:33:12.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
