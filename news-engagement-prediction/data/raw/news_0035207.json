Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA tour guide has defended his 'ghoulish' organised Madeleine McCann trips around the Portuguese apartment where the toddler vanished – by insisting he’s just 'trying to help'. \nThe sick tours are believed to be organised by a British grandfather and look at where the missing three-year-old Brit was last seen alive in Praia da Luz. \nThe trips also take in the nearby tapas restaurant where her parents Kate and Gerry were dining when she vanished and wasteland spots where British cops have dug for her body. \nTourists on the excursions - named Luz Tours and dubbed the “Luz Challenge” - are reportedly then invited to speculate on what happened. \nThe Sun reports that the unnamed organiser who writes a blog called Shining in Luz insists he is just “trying to progress the case”.

The tour takes in this infamous holiday apartment, where Maddie was last seen (Photo: Philip Coburn / Daily Mirror) \nMirrorOnline reported in October how the sightseeing \"Luz\" trips have been slammed by Brits living nearby as “appalling” - and Maddie's parents were said to be distressed by the latest outrageous twist in the story. \nOne astonished expat who lives in the area said: “This is in appalling taste. I couldn’t believe it when I saw it. \n“This is totally uncalled for. A little girl going missing should not be made into a game or a challenge.” \nMadeleine, of Rothley, Leics, was almost four when she vanished from her family’s holiday apartment on May 12 2007. \nThe gruesome tours are ­said to being offered on the Internet by a British grandfather in his 60s who has become obsessed with the case since emigrating to Praia da Luz. \nHe says he lives in “Maddieville” and is offering his version of “Mission Impossible” to work out what happened to Madeleine. \nHe aims the tours at Brits looking for a day trip but insists he does not want payments. \nOur source said: “The guide is obsessed with Maddie. He’s ­written thousands of words about the case and pored over maps, photographs and police transcripts. \n“We don’t know why he is so hung up on it.” Kate and Gerry McCann were eating at this nearby tapas restaurant when their daughter went missing \nThe weirdo started offering the tours in January last year and had the first ­visitor on March 8. \nAccording to the blog used to advertise the tours, trips took place throughout the summer, and he is currently planning the fourth one for later this year. \nIn the first blog about the tour, the so-called host said: “If you can visit Luz, please get in touch with me, because I would like you to show you the reality. \n“I think of this as the Luz Challenge. Our version of Mission Impossible.” \nThen, in an offensive ­comment, the sicko says: “You have to come up with a way in which the McCanns, for whatever reason, ­disposed of Madeleine’s body, and the body was not found in searches.” \nIn a reference to the officer in charge of the original search, the tour guide says: “Gonçalo Amaral struggled, and in my opinion failed, to come up with an explanation. \n“He had something like 25 years of experience policing Portugal and the Algarve, and he failed to come up with a solution to a one-word question. How? \n“How do you dispose of a child’s body when all you have is foot power and no experience of Luz. \n“Would you like to see if you can overcome the Luz Challenge?” \nThe guide lists several places that his clients will be taken to. \nThey start at Apartment 5A at the Ocean Club Hotel where the tot vanished. \nFrom there they go a few hundred yards to the tapas restaurant where her parents were eating with friends – although the guide says a meal will not be possible as the place has closed. Then they visit the spot near the apartment where the McCanns’ friend Jane Tanner saw a mystery man carrying a child, though police later ruled out the sighting. \nThey will also take in the scene of the sighting by Martin Smith, a ­retired businessman, who said he saw a man carrying a child in the direction of the beach. \nOther places in the tour are the areas where police carried out searches two years ago. \nThe first is scrubland to the south-west of the McCann apartment, around the size of three football ­pitches and surrounded by villas and apartments. The two other sites are on the other side of Praia da Luz on either side of the road out of town. \nAnother ghoulish spot on the tour is the Our Lady of the Light church in the centre of Luz. The tour visits the spot excavated by British police searching for Maddie's body (Photo: Steve Reigate / Daily Mirror) \nPolice searched there and a nearby cemetery with rumours circulating that Madeleine was put into someone else’s coffin to be cremated. \nFrom there the guide said he would start looking at all the red herrings and conspiracy theories which had sprung up around the case. \nThese include the rumour Madeleine could have been been hidden on the nearby beach or under rocks. \nResponding to requests on his blog, the guide said he does not charge for the tours or arrange accommodation but has a contact with a flat owner who does reasonable prices. A sketch of a man seen carrying a child in Praia da Luz on the night Maddie was last seen \nThe guide said he is planning to introduce a new tour route suitable for wet weather. \nThe man is said to have moved to the Portuguese resort with his wife several years ago. \nHe is clearly ­unaware or not bothered by the disgust his warped ­pastime is causing. \nSeveral street signs have been sprayed with the message “Stop McCann Circus” in response to all the negative publicity the picturesque Algarve town receives. \nCritics said the sightseeing tour is in appalling taste. \nExplaining why he ­remains anonymous, the guide says: “I see a lot of people for whom the Madeleine McCann case is about them, as if they want major roles in a stage drama. \n“I want the exact opposite. \n“I prefer to remain anonymous, in the background, a non-character in the case. Tour guide's blog describing sick tour \n“That means my musings are more likely to be judged on merit alone. \n“Hopefully, that in turn maximises the chance of working out what ­happened to Madeleine McCann.” \nExplaining the twisted thinking that ­produced the tour, the man says: “My first thought was simple. Read More \n“I just could not make a ghouls tour of Luz fly. Then the idea began to intrigue me. \n“How does one make a ghouls’ tour of Luz actually work? \n“The solution is cheap and cheerful. It comes out of the best penny ­dreadfuls in Victorian era. You do not bother about the truth. Or the facts. You simply go for the thrill value.” The local church of Our Lady Of The Light is also on the tour (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nHe continues: “I suppose, at a push, with all the red herrings around, I could develop a ghouls’ tour with at least 20 points on the map. \n“There must be at least ten more red herrings in the Madeleine story, surely.
