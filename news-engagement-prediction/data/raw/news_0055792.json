It is probably the first school which has introduced Sanskrit along with Urdu and Arabic as the languages taught. \nAddressing a huge gathering, Mr. Chowhan recounted the difficulties he had faced while starting the venture and affirmed that a commitment to the cause of education would give rich dividends. “From the earlier imbalance in the shape of girls being deprived of education, we have now reached the opposite extreme. Girls are now highly educated compared with boys,” he said. \nA revolution \nSpeakers at the function pointed out that Mr. Chowhan’s initiative had led to a revolution in girls' education in Sikar, with all schools getting themselves registered with the government and offering high-quality education. “No girl, especially in the minority communities, stays at home. With higher education, they are all moving up the social ladder,” said activist Ashfaq Kayamkhani. \nTen girls pursuing medical courses, two dozen girls undertaking the unani, ayurvedic and homoeopathy courses and eight girls who have achieved distinction in various sports activities were felicitated on the occasion. \nProminent Mumbai-based scholar and Anjuman-i-Islam Zahir Kazi president was all praise for the initiative that had improved educational standards for girls in the town.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:19:39.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
