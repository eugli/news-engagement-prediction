But the season that we begin shooting in June is going to be about the election that we just went through. So I think that will be interesting for a lot of people.” \nAsked whether there will be “a Trump,” our own personal Ghost of News Cycles Past said, “maybe.” \nOther details about the horror anthology series’ Season 7 are scant. But the new installment will likely not follow campaign details exactly. In the past, the show has merely taken inspiration from real life, such as Season 6’s “Roanoke,” based on the former colony; “Hotel,” based loosely on Los Angeles’ eerie Cecil hotel; and “Coven,” set in the hometown of 19th-century alleged torturer Madame LaLaurie. \nSarah Paulson and Evan Peters are already confirmed to appear, per Deadline , and we’re bound to see other familiar faces. Although which ones might play party nominees Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton ― if they appear ― is hard to guess. \nMurphy’s announcement comes just one day after the team behind “Zero Dark Thirty” revealed an upcoming a miniseries about the election , a project that will likely follow events as they happened more closely.
