Insert fight song of whichever team just won a championship here. (Photo: D Dipasupil, Getty) \nThe Midweek Stock Report — or The MSR, with a capitalized ‘T’ to announce its presence with authority — is designed to highlight trends in and around University of Tennessee athletics, pop culture and anything else we feel like discussing. \nFor those new to The MSR, our weekly roundup is broken down into three categories: Stock Rising for things on the upswing, Stock Falling for things on the downswing and Stock Holding for things that are just as awesome, just as awful or just as mediocre as they were seven days ago. \nThose are the basic ground rules, but The MSR reserves the right to tweak this feature as we see fit. If you don’t like that, start your own website. STOCK RISING \nBABY VOLS BASKETBALL: Yes, The MSR is aware that Tennessee’s most recent basketball game was a truly epic meltdown down the stretch in a struggle-from-ahead, lose-a-19-point lead at Mississippi State, but the general trajectory of Coach Rick Barnes and his young team is still pointing in the right direction. Heck, the Baby Vols’ RPI even went up one spot — from No. 36 nationally to No. 35 nationally — in the immediate aftermath of that frustrating collapse at Mississippi State. Make no mistake, though, that trajectory could change in a hurry this week, with the Vols hosting gotta-win-‘em home games against Ole Miss on Wednesday night at Georgia on Saturday. Tennessee heads to Rupp Arena on Valentine’s Day to battle longtime border-state rival Kentucky, and the Wildcats will want blood after the loss they took in Knoxville earlier this season, and the Vols can ill-afford to remain erratic down the stretch of the regular season if they want to give themselves a chance to play in the NCAA Tournament. And Tennessee badly needs whatever injuries have been bothering senior guard Robert Hubbs to get better. For now, though, we still believe things are looking up. \nCHRISTIAN COLEMAN, HUMAN MISSILE: For all the things The MSR can do, sprinting at a high rate of speed has never been a strength. That makes us appreciate those who can do it, though. And Tennessee’s Christian Coleman is a human missile. Coleman, who was on Team USA’s 4x100 relay team at the Olympics this past summer, was named the USTFCCCA National Athlete of the Week and also was named the SEC Men’s Runner of the Week for the second time this season. The junior from Atlanta now has the world’s fastest 60-meter time of the year after his 6.51-second mark at the Virginia Tech Doc Hale Elite Meet in Blacksburg. Coleman had the world’s fastest time in the 60m and 200m during this indoor season, and he’s now the 11th-fastest 60m runner in NCAA history. One of the 10 runners ahead of him on the NCAA’s all-time list is former Vols football player and track and field All-American and Olympian Leonard Scott, who ran a 6.48 in 2001. Coleman is probably the best athlete at Tennessee right now, and we think he deserves recognition for it. \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

(Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) \nONE MAN, ONE PAIR OF MAN UGGZ AND ONE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM: Quarterback, made model and husband of female model Tom Brady isn’t the most popular man in East Tennessee, and for several reasons, and The MSR understands that. But what else can you say about Brady after he willed his New England Patriots to the largest come-from-behind win in Super Bowl history? If you have the ball in the fourth quarter and need to win a big game, you’re either picking Brady or you’re not giving yourself the best chance to win that game. He struggled badly early in the game, and his receivers dropped several balls in the middle portions of the game, but Brady flipped a switch and became a surgeon with the game on the line. Sure, the Atlanta Falcons aided and abetted that Pats’ comeback. But don’t take anything away from Brady. You don’t have to like the guy to understand he should be on every short list for the best and most clutch quarterbacks in football history. He’s a machine. \nLaMELO BALL (HOG): You know what The MSR says: Ballhogs have feelings, too. And LaMelo Ball was feeling it Tuesday night. The sophomore star at Chino Hills (Calif.) High School scored 92 points in a Wednesday night win against Los Osos High School. Ball — the younger brother of UCLA star Lonzo Ball and UCLA signee LiAngelo Ball — had the Cypress Hill Green of green lights Tuesday night with LiAngelo battling an injury, and he took full advantage. He attempted 61 shots from the floor, and just seven of them were 3-pointers. Still, though, our favorite LaMelo Ball moment came earlier this season, when he randomly pulled up from mid-court, yelled “it’s in” as he released the ball and made the shot. And then nonchalantly turned around like nothing had happened. Bauce. STOCK FALLING \nNEWS FROM BAYLOR FOOTBALL CAN’T GET ANY WOR … WELL IT JUST GOT WORSE: In case you’ve ignored national college football news for the past, oh, year or so, the softest way to put it is that the Baylor football program has cultivated a well-earned reputation as a program with rather odious off-field issues. And for those suggesting that perhaps the Bears could start turning the page and moving forward with new coach Matt Rhule … well … one of the strength coaches who followed Rhule from Temple to Baylor — Brandon Washington — was arrested by police on Saturday morning during a prostitution sting, according to a report from the Waco (Texas) Tribune. At least this encounter seemed to be a consensual encounter, but that didn’t stop Baylor from immediately firing Washington. Baylor seems to be doing everything it can to maim its reputation on a weekly basis. \nNEWS FROM BAYLOR FOOTBALL CAN’T GET ANY WOR … WELL IT JUST GOT WORSE AGAIN: While The MSR appreciates the Big 12 for finally stepping in Wednesday and announcing it would cut 25 percent of Baylor’s conference revenue until a third-party review board was satisfied with changes to the program’s “athletics procedures and to institutional governance of its intercollegiate athletics programs,” we can’t help but wonder why Baylor will get the other 75 percent. What else do we need to see at this point? General tomfoolery is one thing, but this situation at Baylor went well past morally repugnant a long time ago. And it hasn’t been getting any better. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) You got some 'splainin to do, Orge. In English, preferably. (Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) \nOGRE PUBLIC RELATIONS, LLC: There are many things in the recruiting business that rub The MSR the wrong way, and head coaches replacing staff just after National Signing Day is one of those things — though there are some exceptions; not many, but some. Replacing an assistant just after Signing Day almost always looks like a shady move, and that kind of move — whether shady or not — is causing new(ish) LSU head coach and first-ballot The MSR Hall of Manly Men inductee Ed Orgeron some headaches down on The Bayou. Orgeron demoting running backs coach Jabbar Juluke right after NSD rubbed a lot of New Orleans high school coaches the wrong way because Juluke used to be a New Orleans high school coach, and his former peers are meeting later this week to discuss the possibility of boycotting LSU and shutting out the Tigers when they come calling for their prospects. Now, we’re not sure exactly how to handle this, because even if these coaches have a point here — and they almost certainly do have a point — we never like the idea of high school coaches throwing any kind of wrench into a prospect’s recruitment. There might not be a right answer here, but nonetheless it’s good to see these coaches at least doing something to get this issue on the national radar. \nCHICKS DIG THE LONG BALL, BUT GENERAL MANAGERS DO NOT: While The MSR loves Sabermetrics as much as the next baseball dork, sometimes we worry that overcorrections are nearly as bad as the original sin itself. What we mean to suggest is that there’s absolutely no way the New York Yankees should have been able to sign baseball-destroyer Chris Carter for just a $3.5-million, one-year deal. That’s amazingly cheap — less than the average Major League Baseball salary — for a guy in his prime who hit 41 taters last season and has never hit less than 24 taters in a full season at the Major League level. He was fifth in all of MLB last season in total extra base hits per at-bat. Sure, his batting average and on-base percentage numbers aren’t good, but there’s still tangible value to putting the ball over the fence at that clip. Need a late-game tater against a pitcher who might make less than a handful of bad mistakes all night? Need a big fly to get your team off its backside and back into a game? There’s still value in that, in our opinion, and the Yankees will benefit from it. What’s truly amazing is that Carter had so few offers at one point this offseason that he and his agent considered looking at some offers from Japan. Whoa. STOCK HOLDING \nMEET THE NEW STAFF, (SOMETIMES THE) SAME AS THE OLD STAFF: Now that Tennessee has announced (presumably) all of its major coaching staff changes for the 2016 season, The MSR feels obliged to opine on the matter. And … we’re not sure. We’d love to take a firm stance on this one way or the other, but we just don’t know yet. We see reasons to like and be cautious of these moves. The one no-doubter we see if the addition of Charlton Warren as the new defensive backs coach, because his background as a coach and recruiter and outstanding reputation make it tough to see that being anything other than a good move. The rest of the moves, though? We’re not sure. We really like Larry Scott and think he’s ready to be an offensive coordinator, but the fact is he hasn’t called plays, and Tennessee’s a tough proving ground in that area. We do like the Vols bringing in Mike Canales as quarterbacks coach, though, because of his background and familiarity with Scott and his experience as an offensive coordinator to help his former pupil make the transition. We do like the addition of Brady Hoke as defensive line coach, because he’s always been a really good D-line coach and recruiter, and we’re happy to see — and, more importantly, the players will be happy to see — Steve Stripling staying in the program in a more administrative role. And while we think Walt Wells is a fine O-line coach and respected by the players and will do a good job, we do think it’s interesting that Tennessee head coach Butch Jones would promote his No. 2 O-line coach while not retaining his top O-line coach just one season after a failed experiment at promoting the No. 2 strength coach while firing the top strength coach. These situations aren’t necessarily the same, but we don’t blame people for having some concern there. But we’ll see. Jones is going to sink or swim with his guys, and that’s the way it should be. This may or may not be Tennessee's new defensive line coach. Just don't talk about his past. DON'T TALK ABOUT HIS PAST. (Photo: Getty Images, Getty) \nIT’S AN ACCENT THING: Fans concern themselves with a coaches wins and losses, and rightfully so, but The MSR remains as objective as possible in that area and holds firm to the belief that news without fear or favor is the only news that can be trusted. Knowing there are good people and morally deficient people in every program helps us in that endeavor. But we digress. Some things do matter to us, and the accents of the people we speak with on a daily basis are high on that list. While we were disappointed to see Martinez and his Rex Kwon Do accent tossed aside and to see Stripling and his Most Football Coach Ever accent downgraded to a new role within the program, the addition of Hoke and his improbably high pitched voice as the Vols’ new defensive line coach will offset that to some degree. Plus Hoke at least slightly resembles Bobby Baccalieneri from The Sopranos, which also helps. \nBUTCH GONNA BUTCH: There are some who believe The MSR has some sort of vendetta against Jones or has a major problem with Jones, and that’s unfortunate. We’ve covered Jones the same we’ve covered everyone else we’ve covered in this business as a reporter and now senior writer reporter-slash-columnist-slash-whatever-else-it-is-we-do-here. Earn praise, get praise. Earn criticism, get criticism. We’re not always right, but we’re always honest, and we think our track record pretty clearly shows both of those things. Part of the reason we’ve noted and occasionally poked fun at Jones’ ability to speak only in Twitter hashtag is simple: As well as kids these days do with simple, easy-to-understandable, often-repeated phrases, those tend to wear thin with the general populace over time. We let it slide when Jones made his “five-star heart” comment last Wednesday night, but then he said it again Thursday morning in Memphis, and then he said it again Thursday afternoon in Nashville, and finally we reported it because it was pretty clear that’s what Jones wanted everyone to hear. Some will believe anything an active Tennessee football coach says, and that’s their right, but the masses are starting to roll their eyes at Jones’ comments, and the “champions of life” and “five-star heart” comments have taken that frustration to a new level. What’s truly unfortunate is that we do believe there are people at Tennessee trying to help Jones get out of his own way at times, and it doesn’t always work. What Jones says as a coach won’t matter as much as what he does as a coach, but what he says can erode — and seems to be eroding — goodwill. He’s not going to be able to soothsay his way back into everyone’s good graces, and we’re not sure he understands that. We wish he would, though. \nLADY VOLS BASKETBALL: Just when it looks like Holly Warlick and her Tennessee Lady Volunteers have things back on track, they go do something that puts The MSR back into confusion mode. After a 1-3 stretch that featured a huge win over sixth-ranked Notre Dame but losses to Vanderbilt, Mississippi State and Auburn, the Lady Vols got back on on course with a three-game winning streak that included a huge win at fourth-ranked South Carolina. And then they went down to Georgia and lost a double-overtime game at Georgia they had no business losing. We’ve always liked Warlick and know that few people on the Tennessee campus care as much about Tennessee athletics as she cares. This is her dream job, and a job she prepared so long to take, and a place she remained an assistant for years despite getting good offers from other programs. But the Lady Vols have to be better than this. They’re the Lady Vols. The bar is set astonishingly high at that program for a reason. No program can touch UConn right now, but Tennessee shouldn’t be this inconsistent. There are too many advantages there. \nKENNY CHESNEY, BANDWAGON MAN OF THE CENTURY: While The MSR is happy for local boy done good Kenny Chesney for making so much money doing what he loves — even if his kind of music ain't our type of music — we have to call B.S. on him being a fan of every sports team in the known universe that's winning. We just laughed while seeing pictures of Chesney sitting in the luxury suite celebrating a Super Bowl win with Patriots owner Robert Kraft. It wasn't at all surprising. You know that annoying kid in every middle school class who jumps on the bandwagon of every good team and always shows up to school in that team's gear, acting like he's been a fan the whole time? Kenny Chesney is a 50-year-old version of that kid. What an exciting time. (Photo: Florida Atlantic athletics) \nHORRIBLE, FUNNY EXCUSES FOR SPEEDING: It’s no secret that The MSR tends to be a fan of British humor, but you know what translates to good, solid humor across all cultural divides? Air biscuits. Barking Spiders. Crack concerts. Duck calls. Exterminators. Fog horns. Ghost turds. We could go A-to-Z on this, but you get the point. Anyway, a taxi driver in the southern England city of Bournemouth was pulled over by an officer recently and asked why he was driving so fast. The driver said the flatulence from his three passengers was the reason. The officer didn’t buy it. The driver was cited and, presumably, told to just roll down his window next time. \nLANE KIFFIN : Still not Alabama’s offensive coordinator. \nSTEVE SARKISIAN : Still not Alabama’s offensive coordinator. \nANYONE WITH DEEP CALI TIES: Still has no chance in hell of being Alabama’s next offensive coordinator. Just taking a shot in the dark here. STOCKING STUFFERS \nVIDEO OF THE WEEK: This week’s winner is a suggestion given to us by Friend of The MSR Patrick Brown, who covers University of Tennessee sports for the Chattanooga Times Free Press — the place we plied our trade before Shannon Terry made the rare mistake of hiring us not long after he started 247Sports. It’s a 1989 commercial for Mr. Submarine in Chicago. Chicago Bulls great Scottie Pippen stars in the commercial and does so in a delightfully, double-entendre-dishing way. Pippen saying, “Ladies, let’s have a party,” is something that’s hilarious on first viewing and somehow gets funnier every single time. \nCOLLEGE ATHLETE NAME OF THE WEEK: This week’s winner is a Southern Gentleman plying his trade on the West Coast — Cal third-year-sophomore-to-be offensive lineman Gentle Williams . In addition to having perhaps the most ill-fitting and therefore awesome name for an offensive lineman, Williams also has a rather large afro, and the former Florence (Miss.) High School standout goes by afroman_64 on The Twitters and The Instagrams. And his full name is Gentle Williams . No middle name given, no middle name required. Former Tennessee and current Cal basketball coach Cuonzo Martin told The MSR many times that he wanted “Gentlemen on the court but warriors on the wood.” Martin missed the boat with this kid. Surely he could have gotten a few rebounds per game, no? \nPRODUCT OF THE WEEK: If The MSR has taught you people anything, it’s this: Many life lessons can be gleaned from repeated viewings of Forrest Gump. One of those lessons, courtesy of Lieutenant Dan Taylor , is the importance of fresh, quality socks. Do not laugh. Socks are important, and the only people who don’t know that are the unfortunate people who have never felt the craftsmanship of a high-quality sock on their feet. We’ve found a company that combines two of our favorite things — high-quality socks, and charitable donations. Bombas (derived from the Latin word for bumblebee, because the company was inspired by people who appreciate the way bees work together in a hive) is a company that makes absolutely fantastic socks , and for every pair you buy, they donate a pair to homeless shelters. Socks are the most commonly requested items at homeless shelters in this country, and Bombas makes a great product for a reasonable price and helps those among us who need help the most, with more than 1.5 million pairs already donated to those in need. It’s a win-win. And these people don’t pay The MSR a dime. We just believe in what they’re doing, and we love their socks. \nFACT OF THE WEEK: The first football helmet was constructed by an Annapolis shoemaker for cadet Joseph Mason Reeves at the U.S. Naval Academy. Reeves was told that one more blow to the head would more than likely end his naval career, and he needed more cushion for the pushin’. \nCONFESSION OF THE WEEK: The recent flu epidemic going around East Tennessee has caused The MSR to take our first full sick day (when we weren’t in the actual hospital) since we started working for 247Sports. The doctor told us three days or a little more probably would be required for a sufficient recovery, but we demanded a steroid shot in the buttocks and whatever medicine was required to get us back on the job in less than two days. Ish tends to fly sideways anytime we punch out, so us getting back on the clock is a service is something that University of Tennessee supporters should appreciate. There’s a rule, and the longtime members of GoVols247 know it well. That rule never fails. Ever. It must be respected. We must remain on the clock and vigilant at all times. \nRON SWANSON QUOTE OF THE WEEK: “I prefer quality over flash. That’s why I refuse to write my signature in cursive.” \nNON SWANSON QUOTE OF THE WEEK: “Yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose.” -President Lyndon B. Johnson \n\n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?
