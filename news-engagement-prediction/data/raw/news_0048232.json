Jacksonville OT Branden Albert (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:49 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:49 p.m. ET \nThe Dolphins may have found better use for Branden Albert than the cap space they would have saved by releasing him . \nAccording to the South Florida Sun Sentinel , Miami is working to finalize a trade that would send Albert to the Jaguars for tight end Julius Thomas. The deal could be contingent on the players restructuring their contracts, though the Sun Sentinel reported that all parties support the trade — including Albert, who confirmed the news. The trade cannot be finalized until the start of the NFL year on March 9. \nMORE: NFL Mock Draft 2017 \n“Why ruffle feathers when you don’t have to?” Albert told the Sun Sentinel. “It’s the business of the game. I honestly believe where I’m going to go is the right fit. It is going to be a surprise when (the terms) comes out. \n“Where I’m going they put a lot of faith in me, and they know they are getting loyalty back,” Albert said. “My faith, me being a man of Christ, I know God is going to point me where he wants me to be.” \nMORE: Dolphins give Cameron Wake new two-year deal \nAlbert — who signed a five-year, $47 million contract with the Dolphins in 2014 — has struggled with injuries during his time in Miami. The three-time Pro Bowler and first-round selection by the Chiefs in the 2008 NFL Draft never played a full 16-game schedule in three seasons with the team. He missed four starts in 2016. \nThomas, himself a two-time Pro Bowler and one of the league’s best tight ends in 2013 and ‘14, is coming off a season where he caught 30 passes for 281 yards and four touchdowns in Jacksonville. He would help a Dolphins team that has two free agents at the position (Jordan Cameron and Dion Sims). \n“My tenure in Miami, I served my purpose,\" Albert told the Sun Sentinel. \"I was brought here to help change the culture and I believe I did that. Now the team is on a winning path and I leave my mark on the people I was supposed to leave it with, the youngsters on the team.” Watch This ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:52:40.133+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
