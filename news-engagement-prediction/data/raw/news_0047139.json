Story continues below \nAccording to Thomas, surveillance footage also captured some of Jim’s last known movements after he entered a corner store in Cochin where he bought a coffee, used the washroom and then vanished after walking out the front door. \n“I would just love to hear his voice but I have known for quite some time that I’m not going to – that somebody did do something to him because this is not like him,” she sobbed. “I know he would have called me by now.” \nAfter leaving his job at the Maple Leaf Foods plant in North Battleford that fateful day, Jim was last spotted approximately 21 kilometres north of the town on Highway 4. \nHis destination – according to Thomas – was to to seek help from a medicine man after he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. \n“I always prayed with him about that and he led a clean and sober life prior to him going missing.” \nShe is now pleading for anyone with information about Jim’s disappearance to come forward and file a report with police. \n“We would like so much for the RCMP to locate him – whether he’s alive or not – we want to know, we want to bring him home,” Thomas said. \nThe family says if something truly horrible did transpire, they are not interested in placing blame. \nThey just want to find Jim’s remains and lay him to rest beside his mother, who passed away in 2014 without knowing what happened to her son. \n“I just want him to come home, that’s all I really, really want,” Thomas said. \n“I miss him so much.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
