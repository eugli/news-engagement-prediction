Mitchell Starc has enjoyed early success on day two in Pune. Source: AFP \nIt was the first time since 2014 that Kohli had fallen for a duck and the Australian team exploded around Starc in jubilation. \n“The change room won’t be able to believe Virat Kohli is out for zero,” said Michael Clarke on Star Sports. \n“Talk about things being different. \n“The Indian captain back in the rooms for zero is not something the Indian team or fans are used to seeing.” \nAnother former Australian captain Mark Taylor made a similar observation before the series, arguing that if Kohli fell cheaply the Indian dressing room might panic. \nIt’s now up to the Australian attack to finish the job. \nSmith opened with Starc and spinner Steve O’Keefe from the other end, preferring to rotate his pacemen one at a time. \nPinpoint operator Hazlewood hit the mark right from the outset, setting the trap for Vijay and then dismissing him in his very first over. \nThere was little Pujara could do to stay out of the way of a screaming delivery from Starc that took off and caught his gloves on the way through to keeper Matt Wade. \nKohli was then caught out slashing at a wide one, with Starc claiming the most prized wicket in world cricket.
