Nobody could imagine it, could they?\n“But it might ring a bell to one person in this House. It’s our old China (plate) over here, the Leader of the Opposition.\nMinister for Defence Industry Christopher Pyne didn’t hold back. Picture: Mick Tsikas Source: AAP \n“Because that’s exactly what the Leader of the Opposition did when he was the AWU secretary.\n“He travelled with the Pratt family, who owned Visy Industries, to Cuba, to Argentina, to Easter Island, and signed, as the national secretary of the AWU, an agreement with Visy Industries that removed the maternity leave rights and turned them into unpaid maternity leave for the workers of Visy Industries and required the workers’ super get paid into the Pratt super fund.\n“Now, we are going to make that illegal.”\nThe Government could have been encouraged to renew the personal attack by an Essential poll which today reported Mr Shorten’s approval rating had fall from 37 per cent in January to 30 per cent now, four weeks later.\nMr Pyne continued with a reference to Labor Senator Kimberley Kitching — another union identity who was prominent in the TURC, and whom Mr Shorten sponsored into her Upper House position.\n“Amazingly, he took now-Senator Kimberley Kitching and her husband, Andrew Landeryou, on that trip,” he told Parliament.\n“You can just imagine them at the Plaza de Mail, the Presidential Palace, smoking Cuban cigars, Senator Kitching doing her best impersonation of Don’t Cry For Me, Argentina , over the balcony to the bemused tourists wondering what was going on.\n“The thing about the Labor Party and this particular Leader of the Opposition, he’s not much unlike Eva Peron (the legendary Argentinian First Lady of the early 1950s) pretending to be the workers’ friends while actually selling them down the river.\n“Look at what he does, never what he says.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:38:28.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
