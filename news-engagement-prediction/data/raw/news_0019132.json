Twitter SNL is salivating over the EASY D (sorry). SNL writers when they saw that Easy D tweet pic.twitter.com/U96Q2JoYO3 \n— Philip Lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) February 8, 2017 The end is nigh, but at least we’re getting some EASY D. Twitter \nOn a serious note — now that we’ve gotten that out of our system — Donald Trump’s travel ban is arguably a very backward way to approach the issue of terrorism. \nThe ban impacts refugees and people from seven predominately Muslim countries. \nMany refer to it as a “Muslim ban.” \nThe Trump administration says it’s not, even though the president repeatedly uses the word “ban” in his tweets. Twitter \nSince 1980, no refugee has committed an act of terror in the US that’s resulted in the loss of American lives. \nPrior to 1980, the only terror attacks carried about by refugees were perpetrated by Cuban refugees. These attacks killed a total of three people. \nOf the nearly 800,000 refugees accepted into the US since 9/11, less than 20 have been arrested or detained over terrorism-related concerns. \nMoreover, no one from the seven countries Trump has singled out — Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen — have carried out deadly terror attacks on US soil.

They want Muslims to believe the West is at war with Islam. \nWhen America targets Muslim countries with discriminatory policies, it helps terror organizations like ISIS and al-Qaeda recruit. \nStaying true to our values and helping some of the world’s most vulnerable people should not be so hard. \nIt should be an “easy decision.” \nSadly, Trump is determined to spread fear and demonize an entire religion . \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
