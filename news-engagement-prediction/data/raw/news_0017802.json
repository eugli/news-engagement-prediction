Delfin Lorenzana. NOY MORCOSO/INQUIRER.net \nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) will launch an all-out war against the New People’s Army (NPA), the country’s Defense chief said on Tuesday. \nDefense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the NPA remains to be a “security threat” saying that state forces will “hunt them down.” \n“Yes, it’s an all-out war. Ano ba ang pinagkakaiba nila sa Abu Sayyaf (How different are they from the Abu Sayyaf)? They are there to terrorize people to get money. That’s extortion; we will hunt them down,” Lorenzana told reporters in a Palace brieifing. ADVERTISEMENT \nOn Monday, President Rodrigo Duterte tagged the communist group as “terrorist,” saying he no longer believed they were a rebel organization. \n“From now on, I will consider the CPP-NPA-NDF (Communist Party of the Philippines-New People’s Army—National Democratic Front) a terrorist group,” Duterte said. \nThe President earlier lifted the unilateral ceasefire with the communist rebels and terminated the peace talks.
