The woman, from New Jersey, whose name was not released, was pronounced dead at an area hospital, Port Authority police spokesman Joe Pentangelo said. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey owns and manages the entire World Trade center site.\nLocal media reports said the woman was trying to retrieve her twin sister's hat when she fell off the escalator.\nOculus, with its towering white vaulted ceiling, is the focal point of the hub built to replace a terminal that was destroyed when the Twin Towers collapsed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks at the World Trade Center site.
