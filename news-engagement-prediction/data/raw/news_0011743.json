That movie, which like, Friday the 13 th , was to have restarted a horror franchise, cost $25 million and grossed $13 million over the weekend. \nSources say that execs quickly began second guessing Friday the 13 th , believing it would have chased the same audience, although others point out the project is on the opposite spectrum of the horror scale. \nA source close to Friday the 13th would only say that \"the production was not ready to go at this date.\" \nThe project is a reboot of the 1980 slasher film that proved to be a low-cost, high-yield movie series for Paramount, spawning 11 sequels as it told the continuing blood-soaked adventures of Jason Vorhees, the seemingly unstoppable hockey mask-wearing killer of mostly hormonally-charged teens.
