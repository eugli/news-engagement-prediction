Family members said she had a heart problem. \nFamily members said Terrie White was unresponsive for weeks and doctors told them there was a good chance she would not recover, but that was not the case. \n“She’s starting to smile, a lot of eye movement. She’s starting to move her arms and legs, she’s starting to kiss me now when I bend down to kiss her so it’s been amazing,” David White said. \nDavid White said he’s thankful to the people who acted so quickly the day of his wife’s crash. \nThe people who live in the houses she crashed into have frequently visited the hospital during her recovery.
