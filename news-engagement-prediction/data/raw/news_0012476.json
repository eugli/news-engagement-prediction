So, too, did the end of Stan Benge’s bench at Roncalli. \nLet’s start with Ramey. It’s impossible to quantify, but there’s probably not a high school junior in the country that has seen more basketball, in person, than the North Central guard. If there’s a game going on at North Central, or pretty much anywhere else, any time of year, it’s a pretty good bet you can find Ramey there. \nRamey, the daughter of North Central coach DeeAnn Ramey, comes by her love of basketball honestly. \n“We both enjoy going to games,” DeeAnn Ramey said after North Central’s 56-41 win over Cathedral on Saturday in the Sectional 10 championship. “We’re probably at a game about every night. That’s probably helped her basketball IQ. But when we’re at home, she’s a typical girl and I’m a typical mom.” \nBut basketball rarely takes a back seat for the Rameys. DeeAnn, who helped Mooresville to the state finals as a sophomore player in 1978, took over at North Central for longtime coach Alan Vickrey in 2011-12 and guided the Panthers to the program’s third state championship. \nTaylor was a sixth-grader at the time, but she was a part of the team. \n“I was there all the way on the bench,” said Taylor, the defensive glue to this year’s top-ranked and undefeated North Central team. “Being there taught me a lot about being part of a team and winning a championship. I was so close with the girls. It was amazing. I know I want that feeling as a player.” \nTaylor’s grandfather, Larry Ramey, was also there in 2012. Larry, a native of Mitchell, played for Tony Hinkle at Butler in the late 1950s and early ’60s. \nTaylor’s grandfather, like basketball, is never far from her heart. He died in 2013, a year after that state championship run. Taylor wears a bracelet with his name on it. \n“I cried about it last night,” said Taylor, her eyes welling up again after the sectional championship. “I’m so proud of what we’re accomplishing, but I wish he was here, too, because this is great to experience as a basketball family.” Buy Photo \nFrom the end of the Roncalli bench, coach Stan Benge's parents Stan and Jean Benge watch gameplay during sectionals against Pike at Ben Davis High School, Indianapolis, Friday, Feb. 3, 2017. (Photo: Jenna Watson/IndyStar) \nBenge, the Roncalli coach, knows the feeling. On Friday night, his underdog Rebels battled Pike to the wire in a Sectional 11 semifinal before losing 55-53 in overtime. \nSitting at the end of Roncalli’s bench, watching intently, were his parents, Stanley and Jean Benge. A Roncalli win would have been nice on Stanley’s 87th birthday. But having them there was almost just as good. \nFor many years, Jean kept the scorebook when Stan coached at Ben Davis. The Benges, who live in Plainfield, now mostly align their schedule to games coached by their youngest son, Curt Benge, of the Plainfield girls team, due to proximity. \n“It’s great to have them there,” Stan Benge said. “And it would have made it awfully sweet if we would have won.” \nJean Benge kept the book for every game during Ben Davis’ undefeated run to the Class 4A state championship in 2008-09. A bad back nearly kept her from making it to the state championship game that year against South Bend Washington. \n“I said, ‘We’ve won every game this year with you on the book,’” Benge said. “‘We’re getting you down there to keep the book.’ She did it.” \nBen Davis won the game 71-69.

Crothersville has been a member of the Indiana High School Athletic Association for 103 years. … Crispus Attucks claimed its first girls sectional title since 1983 with a 48-43 win over Brebeuf Jesuit in Class 3A Sectional 27 on Saturday. Attucks had been building for four years under coach Mark Stephens, who left just before the season for an assistant coaching position at Xavier. Former Scecina coach Reggen Melson has guided the Tigers to a 19-5 record and into Saturday’s regional game against Northview at Danville. \nCall IndyStar reporter Kyle Neddenriep at (317) 444-6649.
