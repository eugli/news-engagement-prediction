Integrate UK created #MyClitoris to educate on the impact of Types I and IV FGM . The video has praised by Lily Allen and Caitlin Moran. \nThe video, which has over 15,000 views was initially inspired by an article in The Economist, which suggested there were “minor” forms of FGM – the partial or full removal of the female genitalia for non-medical reasons. Integrate UK created #MyClitoris \nThe article, titled, An Agonising Choice , advised that lesser cuts be allowed because progress in stamping out the practice entirely has been too slow. It went as far as suggesting that it is better “a symbolic nick from a trained health worker than to be butchered in a back room by a village elder”. \nIt caused uproar among anti-FGM campaigners, including The Orchid Project who called the piece “grossly irresponsible” and started a petition for the piece to be retracted. According to Bethel Tadesse, Lead outreach worker at Integrate UK, the young people she worked with were already concerned with people’s views on cliterodectomies. Their frustration with the article pushed them to, “actually make something.” \nKnown for creating media that encourages people to engage with social issues, #MyClitoris started as a song that the young activists composed to play during outreach workshops. The group were assisted by songwriter who helps with lyrics and provides the music and early performances of the song proved successful. Realising the potential of the catchy song, they create a video that presents an extreme view of femininity with the help of director Olly Zimmerman. The facts you should know about female genital mutilation \nThe excessive pink backdrop, makeup and wardrobe presents the extremities of gender stereotypes to a laughable degree. The young participants make it clear that expecting girls to conform to these standards or be told what to do with their bodies at all, is unfair. Participants included members of Integrate UK, Oxford Against Cutting and students who helped decide on props and wardrobe. Much of the shooting was carried out by students at a local school in Bristol . \nFar from being a “female” issue, the video features two boys, including Inaz Hussein who can been seen wearing pink makeup and later, a dress. Despite his nervousness, Hussein “happily agreed” to help the cause because, “any form of FGM is still abuse and control of a woman’s sexuality”. \nPraise for #MyClitoris drawn praise from prominent figures: Lily Allen tweeted , “thank you @caitlinmoran for drawing my attention to this wonderful piece” and Channel 4 presented Cathy Newman j okingly tipped the song for Christmas no. 1 . \nFollowing the success of the video, the young campaigners are thrilled by the impact of the video. Waris Despard, who can be seen sporting an arm cast and jumping on a pogo stick said, “the reception has been amazing”. \n“To have people take the song and play it everywhere - it’s normalising [the conversation],” said Despard, who hopes that other young people will be inspired by the actions of the charity. \n“We want young people to know that by doing one thing they can raise awareness. \n“It’s more easy to affect the world around you. These [sic] are teenagers behind all this… You can help.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:04:13.620+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
