That’ll be on April 3 at home against the Braves. \nThat Syndergaard gets the nod comes as no surprise, as he was the Mets’ best starter last season. He went 14-9 with a 2.60 ERA and a 218/43 K/BB ratio in 183 2/3 innings, earning a nomination to the National League All-Star team in the process. Syndergaard finished eight in National League Cy Young Award balloting, but arguably should’ve finished a lot higher than that. \nSyndergaard reportedly added 17 pounds of muscle over the offseason. Considering his 97.9 MPH average fastball velocity was by far tops among starters last season, it’s scary to think about what he can do with even more strength. \nSyndergaard will be the seventh different Met to start on Opening Day in as many years. Those prior to him included Matt Harvey , Bartolo Colon , Dillon Gee , Jon Niese , Johan Santana, and Mike Pelfrey .
