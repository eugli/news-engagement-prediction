Sam Smith won four trophies at the 2015 Grammys, including Best New Artist, Song of the Year, and Record of the Year. (Album of the Year went to Beck, for Morning Phase .) Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images There are just four categories at the Grammy Awards where artists from all musical genres compete against each other — Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best New Artist. In these four races, country artists bump up against R&B musicians, and they both take on pop stars. If an artist wins one of these awards, they'll make headlines and get to give a nice, long speech at the awards telecast. Related But the Grammys’ many, many categories are already steeped in confusing industry speak, and the top four awards are no different. With the exception of Best New Artist, it's easy to confuse the other three. Here's everything you need to know to keep these categories straight. Album of the Year The Album of the Year award is the most prestigious Grammy there is, the rough equivalent of the Best Picture Oscar. The category honors an entire LP, from the first track to the last, and everything about the production of the album's sound. Originally, the Album of the Year award went only to the artist credited with the creation of the album, and to the album's producers. But starting in 1999, with Lauryn Hill's win for The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill , the sound engineers and mixers of the album have also been honored, as have any featured artists who appear on the album. If you participated in the creation of the sound of the album, you get a golden gramophone. However, the album's songwriters are not included in this award. How to remember it: The whole album gets an award! Some people confuse Album of the Year with Record of the Year, since albums used to be on physical records and, thus, the two terms are often used interchangeably in common parlance. But singles also used to be on physical records, and you wouldn't call a single song \"Album of the Year.\" Record of the Year Record of the Year award is often confused with Song of the Year, since both awards go to individual songs. But the distinction is actually pretty simple to remember. The Record of the Year honors, first and foremost, the performing artist. Song of the Year honors the songwriter. This award is given to the performing artist, the producers, the sound engineers, the master engineer, and the sound mixers. The Record of the Year award directly correlates with the way song copyrights are created. For every song, there are at least two copyrights: The first goes to the songwriter, and the second goes to the performer. Those copyrights determine how a song’s contributors get paid, and how much they are paid. The people who make the sound of the song (not the words and melody), own the \"Sound Recording\" copyright. Hence, Record of the Year. How to remember it: Instead of thinking of \"record\" as a physical, spinning record, think of it the product of a recording studio. Everyone who would be in a recording studio working on the Record of the Year–winning song receives a golden gramophone for this award. Song of the Year The Song of the Year Grammy doesn't actually honor the performer of the winning song. Instead, it goes to the people who wrote that song. It's easy to get this award confused with Record of the Year because there is often overlap in who is accepting the award. For example, if an artist has songwriting credit on their nominated song (a pretty common occurrence), then the artist might accept the award and give the speech. But they are receiving the award for writing and constructing the song, not their performance of it. Legally, this side of the copyright is known as the mechanical copyright. (Its name stems from the invention of mechanical pianos.) That copyright only goes to the songwriter, as does this award. How to remember it: Try to think of it as Songwriter of the Year, rather than just Song. Was this article helpful?
