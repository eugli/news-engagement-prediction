Article continues below \nMore often than not, he would single-handedly drag his side through the trenches and out the other side with three more points to their names. \nBut it would be foolish to completely write off his teammates, some of them were pretty special too.

He scores great goals, all type of goals, he creates out of nothing,\" Gerrard said, as per the Liverpool Echo . \n\"He occupies the whole back four by himself. He was an absolute dream to play with. He was always on the move so that you could pick him out. Just a phenomenal footballer. \n\"He’s gone to another level since he moved to Barcelona with his goal and assist return.\" \nAfter missing out on the title in 2014, Suarez was snapped by Barcelona, where he has enjoyed success both in La Liga and Europe. \nBut Gerrard thinks there would have been a good chance of Liverpool winning the Premier League had the Uruguayan stayed on. \nHe added: \"There’s so many good teams in the Premier League but he would have given Liverpool a better chance. \n\"You’re guaranteed goals, assists, he just causes every opposition problems and creates a lot of space for the players around him.\" \nTypically, after speaking so highly about him pre-match, Suarez went on to have one of his worst performances in a Barca shirt on Tuesday night. \nLuis Enrique's men were thrashed 4-0 by PSG in the first leg of their round of 16 clash and face the very serious possibility of crashing out of the Champions League at the first knockout stage. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
