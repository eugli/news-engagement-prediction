(BBC Sport) \nTheo Walcott was left red-faced after he was not given an Arsenal pennant to give to Sutton Unitedâ€™s captain before kick-off on Monday evening. \nThe gesture is a typical one between teams at either end of the football pyramid during the FA Cup and while Walcott received a pennant from Sutton captain Jamie Collins, the England international had nothing to give in return. \nFans immediately picked up on Arsenalâ€™s faux pas and criticised the club over their â€™embarrassingâ€™ decision. \nOn a brighter note for Walcott and Arsenal, the forward scored the second goal to secure a 2-0 victory at Gander Green Lane after Lucas Perez had put the Gunners in front in the first half.
