That's evident in the four mozzarella appetizer choices. Among them is a trio of truffled, fresh burrata made from mozzarella and cream, mozzarella nodino with a denser texture and Prosciutto di Parma, the thinly sliced dry cured ham.\nCaption The Eat Beat: JWB Prime Steak and Seafood at Margaritaville Resort Mike Mayo of the Eat Beat reviews the JWB Prime Steak and Seafood Restaurant at Margaritaville Resort in Hollywood.\nMike Mayo of the Eat Beat reviews the JWB Prime Steak and Seafood Restaurant at Margaritaville Resort in Hollywood.\nCaption The Eat Beat: JWB Prime Steak and Seafood at Margaritaville Resort Mike Mayo of the Eat Beat reviews the JWB Prime Steak and Seafood Restaurant at Margaritaville Resort in Hollywood.\nMike Mayo of the Eat Beat reviews the JWB Prime Steak and Seafood Restaurant at Margaritaville Resort in Hollywood.\nCaption The Eat Beat: Rappy's in Boca Raton The Eat Beat: Rappy's in Boca Raton \nThe Eat Beat: Rappy's in Boca Raton \nCaption Best Coffeehouse: The Alchemist - Best of 2016 In 2016, SouthFlorida.com readers voted the Alchemist (2430 NE 13 Ave., Wilton Manors) the best coffeehouse for the annual Best of South Florida.  \nIn 2016, SouthFlorida.com readers voted the Alchemist (2430 NE 13 Ave., Wilton Manors) the best coffeehouse for the annual Best of South Florida. \nCaption Best Tiki Bar: Mai-Kai Restaurant - Best of 2016 In 2016, SouthFlorida.com readers voted The Mai-Kai Restaurant (3599 N.
