Emergency services warned residents to prepare for more flooding near the Murray River and Swan River catchments over the coming days. More than 114mm of rain was recorded in Perth in the 24 hours leading up to Friday morning This dog is seen making the most of the wet weather, finding a cool reprieve in the floodwaters The floods come just two days after major power outages plunged much of Perth into darkness.

A heatwave will bring 'exceptionally hot' temperatures to New South Wales from Friday until Sunday in what meteorologists say is the 'final big hurrah for heat in the Sydney area'. Temperatures are predicted to climb to 39C in the city and to 46C in the western suburbs on Saturday. 'All take care in Toodyay District. Flood water across several roads. Don't risk trying to cross.
