SEE ALSO: Apple's BeatsX earphones are now available online \nThe 12.9- and the 9.7-inch models will obviously be a continuation of the current iPad Pro lineup. The 10.5-inch tablet would be a new model, while the 7.9 would likely replace the iPad mini. \nThis contradicts some earlier reports which never mentioned the iPad mini. However, Macotakara reported once before — in October 2016 — that an \"iPad mini Pro\" will be coming. Note that in that report, the outlet claimed the all-new iPad Pro will have a 10.9-inch screen, not a 10.5-inch one. \nWe're not seeing it on Macotakara , but MacRumors points to the same report and claims the new, 7.9-inch iPad Pro will have four speakers, a 12-megapixel rear camera, a Smart Connector and a True Tone display. Furthermore, all new iPad Pros will have four microphones. \nThe report also claims Apple might introduce a version of the iPhone SE with 128GB of storage, as well as a red variant of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, and a new band for the Apple Watch. \nApple last refreshed its iPad lineup at an event in March 2016, so a similarly timed event this year makes sense. However, no invites have been sent yet, so it's all in the realm of rumors right now.
