[PODCAST] In this episode of Indie Film Weekly , we weigh in on how \"independent film\" should be defined and share results of our big shootout between the Alexa Mini and Epic-W Helium. Co-hosts Jon Fusco , Emily Buder , and yours truly, Liz Nord discuss how the inaugural American Independent Film Awards are helping to redefine awards season, how indie cinemas are banding together nationwide for a cause, a surprising way to increase your film’s profitability, and SAG-AFTRA’s political turn. Tech writer Charles Haine joins us for gear news, including our epic (and contentious) shootout between recent two popular cameras and a new lens from Fujinon that marks the company’s venture into the world of indie film. In Ask No Film School, we advise on why your videos look so different on YouTube than in your editing system, and how to compensate. As always, the show also brings news you can use about gear, upcoming grant and festival deadlines, this week’s indie film releases, our Ask No Film School segment, and other notable things you might have missed while you were busy making films.
