Collins said pitchers will refrain from throwing during drills that begin Tuesday, which he said he and the pitching coach Dan Warthen calculated would save their arms about 100 throws per day. “We just hope that the rest early, and trying to build them up gradually, is maybe in our best interest,” Collins said. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Harvey, 27, said he was focused on getting through spring training in one piece. He has missed almost the equivalent of two of the past three seasons because of Tommy John surgery in 2013 and the thoracic outlet syndrome that was discovered last July only after he had struggled repeatedly on the mound. After surgery to deal with the syndrome — a rib was removed to alleviate nerve compression — Harvey spent a week in the hospital. For several days he could not feel his fingers, which scared him, but his sensation returned and Monday he fired a baseball with ease during a bullpen session. And he, too, seems to have gotten the message about everyone staying healthy. He said he hoped to use spring training to apply additional preventive aspects to his daily routine. “Whether it’s stretching or things like that, kind of continuously doing that and making sure you’re on top of everything, so no more injuries happen,” he said. Wheeler, 26, was the most restrained about his health and the upcoming season. “I don’t want to get my hopes up too much because I’ve had so many setbacks,” he said. “I’m wiping my slate clean and trying to treat it like a normal spring training.” Collins said the fifth starter’s spot is an “open competition” between Wheeler, Robert Gsellman and Seth Lugo because Wheeler has not pitched in the majors since 2014, and Gsellman and Lugo helped the Mets down the stretch last season with their unexpectedly strong pitching. But Wheeler should ultimately get his chance to be part of that elusive rotation that has yet to be. Like everyone else, he just has to stay healthy.
