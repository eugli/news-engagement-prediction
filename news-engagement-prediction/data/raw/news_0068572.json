In most of the cases, police said a man would approach a parked car with a woman inside, then expose his genitals and masturbate. \nDuring the investigation, police said they also found 12 “intimate” images posted in public places around the city, mostly stapled to signs. The images were allegedly posted without the victim’s consent. \nPolice said they began investigating after the first report on Nov. 30, but were not able to identify a suspect and gather enough evidence to charge the individual until Feb. 17. \nGregory Stopanski, 51, is facing nine charges of indecent acts and 12 charges of distributing intimate images without consent. He is also charged with one count of breach of a peace bond. \nStopanski appeared in provincial court Tuesday morning.
