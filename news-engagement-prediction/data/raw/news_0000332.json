Article continues below \nThe 36-year-old has been a key player under no less than ten different managers over the course of his 19-year career at Stamford Bridge, but it seems the 11th has proved otherwise. \nHe has so far made just five top-flight appearances under Antonio Conte, whose revolutionary 3-4-3 formation is far from an ideal system for an ageing centre-back with weary legs. Article continues below Kevin Nolan signs himself for Notts County \nTerry has been pushed out of the side by Gary Cahill, David Luiz and Cesar Azpilicueta in central defence, adding fuel to the rumours he could hang up his boots at the end of the season. \nWeeks away from becoming a free agent last May, the Chelsea stalwart was offered a one-year contract extension in the latter stages of the 2015-16 campaign, but it seems his time at the club could finally be up. \nDuring his absence from regular first team action, Terry has been doing some reading in his spare time, seemingly in preparation for life off the pitch. \nThe veteran defender posted a photo on his Instagram story of a book: Alan Gernon’s ‘Retired: What Happens to Footballers When the Game’s Up’. \nThe book focuses on ex-footballers who run into financial troubles after failing to brace themselves for life after football. \nWhile Terry certainly doesn't fit that description given his lucrative earnings over a two-decade spell at Chelsea, he's widely thought to be interested in taking up a coaching role once he says goodbye to the game. \nRegardless of how his situation at Chelsea plays out, there’s also a possibility Terry could see out the swan song of his career away from west London – most likely in the United States or China next season. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
