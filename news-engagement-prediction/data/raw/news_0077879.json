Close SpaceX Dragon Docks With International Space Station UP NEXT VIDEO \nTech billionaire Elon Musk - the company's founder - announced the surprising news on Monday. \nTwo people who know one another approached the company about sending them on a week-long flight just beyond the moon, according to Musk. He won't identify the pair or the price tag. They've already paid a \"significant\" deposit, he noted. \nMusk said SpaceX is on track to launch astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA in mid-2018. This moon mission would follow about six months later, by the end of the year under the current schedule, using a Dragon crew capsule and a Falcon heavy rocket. The mission would be the first time in decades humans have ventured this far from Earth.

But they're coming into this with their eyes open,\" said Musk, adding that the pair will receive \"extensive\" training before the flight. 'Oh-m': Electric vehicle uptake brings 'ohm' driving to the fore \nMusk said he does not have permission to release the passengers' names, and he was hesitant to even say if they were men, women or even pilots. He would only admit, \"It's nobody from Hollywood\". \nThe passengers would make a long loop around the moon, skimming the lunar surface and then going well beyond, perhaps 480,000km or 640,000km distance altogether. The mission won't involve a lunar landing, according to Musk. \nIt's about 386,000km to the moon alone, one way. South African physicist, inventor, and SpaceX founder Elon Musk addresses the press in September on his plans to head for Mars. Photo: AAP \nNASA will have first dibs on a similar mission if it so chooses, Musk said. The space agency learned of his plan at the same time as reporters, and was busy preparing a statement following the announcement. \nThe crew Dragon capsule has not yet flown in space. Neither has a Falcon Heavy rocket, which is essentially a Falcon 9 rocket with two strap-on boosters, according to Musk. He said there will be ample time to test both the spacecraft and the rocket, before the moon mission. \nMusk expects to have more moon-mission customers as time goes by.
