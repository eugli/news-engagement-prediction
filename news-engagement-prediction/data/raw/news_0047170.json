(Photo: Elise Amendola, Associated Press) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nVerizon and Yahoo have agreed to reduce the price the telecommunications giant will pay to acquire the online media company by $350 million. \nLast year, Verizon agreed to pay $4.8 billion for Yahoo's Internet business, which includes Yahoo Mail, Flickr, Tumblr and Web properties such as Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports. In the wake of the deal, Yahoo disclosed that it had suffered two massive data breaches, one in 2013 and another in 2014, the first one being the largest reported data breach ever, involving the theft of data associated with more than one billion user accounts in August 2013. \nUnder the deal's amended terms, Verizon will pay $4.48 billion and the two companies will share some legal and regulatory liabilities arising from the breaches. \n\"We have always believed this acquisition makes strategic sense,\" said Marni Walden, Verizon's executive vice president and president of product innovation and new businesses. \"We look forward to moving ahead expeditiously so that we can quickly welcome Yahoo's tremendous talent and assets into our expanding portfolio in the digital advertising space.\" \nThe amended agreement, she said, \"delivers a clear path to close the transaction in the second quarter.\" \nFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider .
