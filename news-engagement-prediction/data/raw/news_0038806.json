As will the fans watching at home. \n'This kid has attracted interested from the biggest clubs in the world, including both Manchester clubs, Arsenal, Chelsea, Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig. \n'He's scored in Fulham's last two FA Cup ties. XIs coming up so we'll soon see if he starts. ' 12:55 Meanwhile Tottenham fans skip the traffic and arrive on a boat \nCraven Cottage being on the bank of the River Thames, why not take advantage of a boat if it's available?
