In fact, he is acting like the bigot he says he wants to fight against.” \n“Oh my god, that is absolutely outrageous,” responded Bernie-Sanders -supporter-turned-Trump-superfan Harlan Hill . He shot back that Trump’s election opponent Hillary Clinton took foundation money from some of the most anti-Semitic and anti-gay countries in the Middle East. \nCNN host Brianna Keilar interjected and asked Hill to stay focused on the topics at hand: Trump. “He told a Jewish reporter to sit down — a Jewish reporter who had good will towards him– when he asked about anti-semitism,” she pointed out. \nHill argued that Trump misheard the question and would’ve disavowed anti-Semitism if he understood. “Oh, lord,” Rye responded, rolling her eyes. \n“Did he agree with that sentiment? No. But he did not disavow it in clear terms like you are describing right now,” Keilar said. \n“This is slanderous!” Hill said. “We’re making a baseless accusation, accusing him of being anti-Semitic when his grandchildren are Jewish.” After lots of shouting, Keilar explained slowly that she was not accusing Trump of anti-Semitism, just discussing his failure to condemn it earlier. \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:46:10.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
