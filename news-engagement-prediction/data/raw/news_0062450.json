It’s hard to be allied with someone who wants to destroy you,” the diplomat added. \nThe administration’s decision to send the generally well-regarded US Secretary of Defense, Jim Mattis, to Europe over the last week to reassure allies about the US commitment to both the EU and NATO started off well, say multiple EU observers, until his speech to NATO threatened a withdrawal of American support on defense issues unless spending is increased. \n“I owe it to you to give clarity on the political reality in the United States and to state the fair demand from my country’s people in concrete terms,” Mattis told European defense officials. “America will meet its responsibilities, but if your nations do not want to see America moderate its commitment to this Alliance, each of your capitals needs to show support for our common defense.” \nAlthough US pressure to increase defense spending to the mandated 2 percent of GDP has been a longtime policy, the language used by Mattis, broadly considered an experienced and thoughtful policy hand, shocked some observers because it contradicted the tone of a private meeting between Mattis and German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen on Feb. 10 at the Pentagon, according to accounts from EU observers and reports from the German media. \n“Mattis was speaking from a script that felt like it was written by Bannon,” said a EU analyst in the audience in Brussels. “After he had gone to great lengths in his meeting with Von Der Leyen to reassure Europe that the adults were in charge of security policies.” German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen with Mattis last week.

So maybe there’s another union that needs a little taming,” he said. \nAlthough passage of a bill rejecting Malloch would be only symbolic in nature, it would lack any sort of historical precedent. \n“For the new administration to propose an ambassador who openly compares the EU to the Soviet Union and patronizingly suggests taming the world’s largest open market is a bit of an alarm, not to mention insult,” said the Belgian security official. \nReimagining the relationship with the US could take on a very broad range of changes from increasing visa regulations for American travelers to Europe — a decision considered last year but ultimately shelved — to tougher trade negotiations, to limited cooperation on certain security issues, such as Russia or the fight against ISIS. \n“The problem of course is that after 50 years of relying on a partner for security and trade, it will be no easy task to not only do these thing bilaterally but also make sure that the partner isn’t actively trying to undermine your efforts,” said one French official at the Ministry of Defense, who said he lacked authorization to speak to the press.
