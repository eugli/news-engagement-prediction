Grime artists were again passed over, despite being nominated in both the best album and breakthrough act categories.\nThe late David Bowie also won two of the biggest awards of the night, for   and MasterCard British Album for Blackstar. Bowie was last year given the Brit icon award, which this year went to Robbie Williams.\nBut it was the more diverse mix of winners that was the most notable feature of the evening. The 2016 shortlists prompted a viral campaign dubbed #Britssowhite as well as condemnation from artists including Laura Mvula and Stormzy, who took aim in his track One Take Freestyle: “What? None of my Gs nominated for Brits? Are you taking the piss? Embarrassing.”\n\n  Grime star Skepta performing at the Brits on Wednesday night.

This year’s Brits had an unprecedented 45% of nominees from BAME backgrounds. But while grime, the genre born in the council estates of east London 15 years ago that has grown to dominate British subculture, was finally represented by multiple nominations for Stormzy , Skepta and Kano, no grime artist won an award.\nEmeli Sandé won British female solo artist, beating Ellie Goulding, Anohni, Lianne La Havas and Nao. Adele won the Brits global success award, a year after she dominated the show by taking home four awards and hot off the back of her Grammys success earlier this month.\n\n  and international female solo artist went to Drake and Beyoncé respectively, and   won in the international group category.\nThe award for best British group went to the 1975, who beat Bastille, Biffy Clyro, Radiohead and Little Mix. The latter picked up an award for best single for Shout Out to My Ex, which debuted at number 1 in the charts last year.\nMeanwhile, Rag’n’Bone Man won   act, a category that also included Stormzy, Anne-Marie, the band Blossoms and Skepta. Skepta won the Mercury prize for his fourth album, Konnichiwa, in 2016, at the time prompting Tory culture minister Matt Hancock to claim that he and his team listened to grime in their ministerial car . Rag’n’Bone Man’s success marks the first time the breakthrough award has been won by the critics’ choice winner.\nTo address concerns with the voting system, the awards’ organisers announced a new voting method that would be more inclusive of BAME communities as well as ensuring a more balanced gender ratio. The committee this year was made up of approximately 17% BAME voters and 48% women.\nIt was a move that followed continuous criticism of the industry from artists and critics alike, who have pointed to a disconnect between what audiences are listening to and what is celebrated at big awards.\nSpeaking to the Guardian recently, the artist Nao said this was due to an outdated idea that music made by black musicians was urban and therefore niche, while music made by white artists was accessible and mainstream. “Definitely, there has been a reluctance to acknowledge black music as mainstream,” she said.\nBritish grime speaks about what their world is like and maybe the music industry finds that uncomfortable\nNao \n“Maybe they have the wrong interpretation of the music. British grime, for example, speaks about their reality, how they’ve lived and what their world is like and maybe people, or the music industry anyway, doesn’t want to accept that or finds it uncomfortable. \n“That’s maybe why they don’t celebrate it at these awards ceremonies, because it’s wrongly perceived as aggressive or dark or angry or too political.”\nAcross the Atlantic at the Grammys, despite a diverse lineup of nominees, all the big awards were still taken home by white artists, and Beyoncé only won the best urban contemporary award rather than best album for Lemonade – the third time she lost out to a white artist. Kendrick Lamar also only won the best urban contemporary award, a so-called cultural bias that prompted a blogpost by Frank Ocean explaining why he did not submit his music to the Grammys at all.\nThis year’s Brit awards were hosted by Dermot O’Leary and Emma Willis after Canadian singer Michael Bublé pulled out because his son is ill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:35:11.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
