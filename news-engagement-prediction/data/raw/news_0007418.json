(Photo: azcentral.com) \nAn Arizona man has been convicted of charges accusing him of helping a New York City college student join the Islamic State group in Syria.\nThe Manhattan federal court jury returned the verdict Monday in the case against Ahmed Mohammed el Gammal.\nProsecutors say the 44-year-old Avondale man, also known as Jammie Gammal, helped 24-year-old Samy el-Goarany reach Syria in early 2015 . El-Goarany trained with the terror group before his family was notified later that year that he had been killed in battle.\nThe jury found el Gammal guilty of providing material support to a designated terrorist organization, conspiracy to provide support, receiving military-type training from a foreign terrorist organization, and conspiring to receive military-type training.\nDefense lawyers argued that el-Goarany engineered his own fate as he looked for meaning in life to erase his own feelings of inadequacy. They say others, including relatives, were unable to stop the Baruch College student from joining the Islamic State group.\nPreet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, issued a statement Monday afternoon saying terrorist organizations like ISIS need facilitators around the globe to grow its \"brand of hate-filled violence and radicalization.\"\n\"An Ambassador for ISIS right here in America, el Gammal actively touted and glamorized ISIS online, ultimately recruiting and helping a New York college student travel to an ISIS camp in Syria for military training,\" Bharara said. \"That New Yorker died waging jihad, and for El Gammalâ€™s active role in sending him down that trail to terror, he now stands convicted of federal terrorism crimes.\"\nAll told, el Gammal could face up to 55 years in prison. A date for the sentencing hearing was not immediately set.\nAZCENTRAL\nSentence postponed for Phoenix man guilty of attack inspired by ISIS\nAZCENTRAL\nPhoenix man pleads not guilty to terror-related charges", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:43:27.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
