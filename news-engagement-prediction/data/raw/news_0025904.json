The interview was published days before Netanyahu was due to visit the White House. \nIn the interview, published in Hebrew and with no English transcript made immediately available, Trump was also reported as as saying he was still thinking “seriously” about moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a move fiercely opposed by the Palestinians, although he believes it may not be easy. \nThe paper also quoted Trump as calling on Israel to act ”reasonably” over the peace process and, citing the limited land available, as saying: “I’m not someone who believes that advancing settlements is good for peace.” \nThe apparent u-turn followed an equally dramatic reversal in Trump’s position on China , after a phone call with President Xi Jinping in which Trump said he would not challenge Beijing by upending longstanding US policy towards Taiwan. \nTaken at face value, Trump’s comments would appear to be a blow to Israel’s right, which had been pushing Netanyahu to double down on a recent surge of pro-settlement moves , including the approval of 6,000 new housing units and a highly controversial legalisation bill aimed at regularising illegal outposts on the West Bank . \nIt was unclear, given the Trump administration’s contradictory statements on the issue, how seriously the comments could be taken, not least because they appeared at odds with a White House statement last week suggesting the administration did not see settlements “as an impediment to peace”. \n“I want Israel to behave properly in the peace process,” translations of Trump’s words reported him saying. “ I’m sure it will finally happen after so many years. And maybe there will get a bigger peace deal than just Israel and the Palestinians. I want both sides to acts reasonably and I think I have a good chance at that,” Trump said. \n“There is limited land left, and every time you take land for settlements, there’s less land left. I’m not someone who believes that advancing the settlements is good for peace. But we’re checking all the possibilities.” \nThe president made clear he did not want to publicly criticise Israel: “I don’t want to condemn Israel. Israel has a long history of condemnations and challenges. I don’t want to condemn Israel during my administration. \n“I understand Israel very well and respect it very much. Israelis have gone through very difficult periods. I want peace between Israelis and Palestinians and even more than that. I think peace for Israel would be great for Israel, not just good.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T19:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:36:02.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
