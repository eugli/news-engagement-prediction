Source: YouTube \nMs Hanson has yet to comment on her candidate’s beliefs but an angry tweet fired off on Wednesday morning, widely assumed to be related to Mr Archibald’s comments, makes it clear she has no intention of doing so.\nTo all the fat lazy politicians & fat lazy journalists in the fat lazy media playing fat lazy, PC, identity politics- The answer is no.\n— Pauline Hanson (@PaulineHansonOz) January 31, 2017 Ms Hanson, is a divorced mother of four children, and hence, a single mother.\nShe divorced her second husband, Mark Hanson, in 1987, when her children were six and three.\nHer eldest two children from her first marriage were 14 and 11.\nBut Ms Hanson has also, in the past, expressed her own views about single mothers as welfare cheats.\nIn her maiden Senate speech last September, she said she wants single mothers to only get welfare for their first child.\nShe further urged women who found themselves single and with children to, “Get a job and start taking responsibility for your own actions”.\nShe, famously, ran a fish and chip shop in Ipswich before entering politics.\nHer comments, however, pale into comparison with hose of Mr Archibald’s in 2015.\nIn the Quadrant article, which stemmed from former Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s comments about the “lifestyle choices” of residents of welfare-dependent remote Aboriginal communities, he asked why the “much-taxed rest of us” pay for the “lifestyle choices” of single mothers.\n“These are women too lazy to attract and hold a mate, undoing the work of possibly three million years of evolutionary pressure,” he wrote.\n“This will result in a rapid rise in the portion of the population that is lazy and ugly.\n“We know what causes pregnancy these days, so everyone who gets pregnant outside of marriage is a volunteer.\nMr Archibald also took aim at disability pensioners and childcare as prime candidates for federal defending. Source: Facebook \n“This is an easy one for defending.”\nMr Archibald said this week he stood by the comments, which also took aim at disability pensioners and federally-funded childcare.\nThe two-year-old comments ignited outrage.\nSingle mothers and children raised by lone mothers flooded his Facebook page to hurl insults.\n“David, I just read your opinions about lazy single mums and the kids we bring into society. Yep I’m a single mum,” one woman wrote.\n“I want you to schedule an appointment for me and my daughter to see you.\n“In fact I challenge you. I’m very serious.\n“Allow me to show you what a single parent and her daughter looks like.\n“Just to give you a heads up on the conversation you might have with us, I have six degrees. My daughter has four.\n“Now schedule that appt (sic) please.\n“I think you might need to make a public apology.\n“You ignorant man. Your comment about single mums is equivalent to saying every male is a pedophile (sic).”\nOne Nation candidate says single mothers are \"lazy and ugly\". Seems to have forgotten his party leader is a single mother too. #auspol \n— Eddy Jokovich (@EddyJokovich) January 31, 2017 Attacking single mothers yet leaving out 4 women dead this year form being attacked by partners! Thanks Labor for calling out this idiot! https://t.co/e3ELosYpf0 \n— camybobany (@camybobany) January 31, 2017 How dare a fat, pathetic male have the audacity to attack single mothers. I would love five minutes with this fat piece of lard alone.\n— Stephanie Hunter (@luxtraveldate) January 31, 2017 There have been widespread calls for Ms Hanson to dump Mr Archibald from the party, following a string of disendorsements of candidates in Queensland.\nFar North Queensland candidate Peter Rogers was dumped after writing an article that claimed images of a Syrian toddler’s body washed up on a Turkish beach in 2015 were fabricated, along with the Port Arthur massacre in 1996.\nShan Ju Lin was sacked earlier last month for anti-gay comments, while Andy Semple withdrew his nomination after people within the party raised concerns about inappropriate comments he had made on Twitter.\nFederal Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese, the son of a single mother, also joined calls for the controversial candidate to be dumped.\n“I have nothing but respect for my late mum and I regard his comments as incredibly, personally offensive but more importantly offensive towards all those single parents out there,” Mr Albanese told ABC radio.\nHe also made a pointed post about his mother in a Facebook post marking the 33rd anniversary of Medicare.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:09:48.674+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
