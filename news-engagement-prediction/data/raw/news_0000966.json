Tom Brady once had one of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” hats visible in his locker . The 45th president has no qualms counting the Patriots’ coach and quarterback among his supporters . \nBut they’d rather not talk about it , a theme that extended to Super Bowl 51 Opening Night’s media availability in Houston. Brady and Belichick were peppered with multiple questions each on Trump, and they dodged them elusively. \n“I’m not talking politics at all,” Brady said after a third question. “Why? Because I just want to focus on the positive aspect of this game and my teammates,” Brady said. “(I’d prefer to) not let anything really take away from that.” \nBelichick added, to a separate (and smaller) horde of reporters, “I’m focused on getting my team ready to play the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday night. That’s where all my attention is.” \nPatriots tight end Martellus Bennett spoke out against Trump’s executive travel order , but his team’s leaders simply wouldn’t speak about it at all. NFLCommunications.com didn’t even include Brady or Belichick’s non-responses to Trump-related questions in their quote sheets from the event, though Falcons receiver Mohamed Sanu’s more loquacious explanation on why he’s not talking about it made the cut. \nSo what did they talk about? FOOTBALL! \nIt’s pretty much the only thing Belichick seems to enjoy talking about, and he’s very good at it, so that makes sense. Of course, it’s also why they’re in Houston in the first place. \nBrady and Belichick had very positive words for the Falcons and Matt Ryan and Dan Quinn and everything else, and they were so boring we’re not even going to quote them here. ‘Curb Your Enthusiasm’ cameos \nActor J.B. Smoove was in attendance as a reporter for “The Rich Eisen Show,” and Belichick couldn’t hold back his admiration for Smoove’s HBO work. \n“One of the greatest shows on TV,” Belichick said, via NFL.com . “I’d do a cameo for sure. Tell (Larry David) to give me a call.” Other presidents \nBoth Brady and Belichick were asked about George H.W. Bush, who recently was released from a Houston hospital and reportedly has been asked to do the Super Bowl coin toss . \nBrady’s exchange was particularly telling. Video via the Boston Herald: \nReporter: “Tom, former president George H.W. Bush just got released from a Houston hospital today. Do you have a message for him?” \nBrady: “Well, I’m glad he’s out of the hospital, certainly, and I’ve had a chance to be around him on a few occasions and always enjoyed it, so.” \nReporter: “Do you have a message for the current president?” \nBrady: “I just wish everybody the best.” \nAsked the same questions, Belichick simply laughed off the second. High school? \nSomeone asked Belichick about a high school football victory. We’ll leave the quote here if you’re interested: \n“That was a good win. 34-8 I think it was. That was a big win. We were 8-0 that year. Andover was great. We didn’t lose any games in football and we only lost one game in lacrosse. It was a good year. Great experience for me, both academically and athletically. Socially, I met a lot of great friends there. It is a great school. My daughter went there. Linda (Holliday’s) daughter went there. Can’t say enough great things about Andover. Beat Exeter.” Gisele Bundchen \nOf course Brady was asked about his supermodel wife. Turns out she gave him a gift and some advice. \n“I’ve been very blessed to find her. Wonderful woman, wonderful partner. She does everything. She gave me this (necklace) for protection, and she’d be really happy that I’m wearing it because she doesn’t like anyone hitting me. She always says, ‘Throw the ball really fast, really fast.’ So that’s what I try to do.” Positivity \nOne of Brady’s last answers about Trump — it was hard to keep track because questions were inaudible — said it all. And by that, we mean nothing. \n“You know, like I said, I’m just a positive person. I want the best for everybody.” More New England Patriots!
