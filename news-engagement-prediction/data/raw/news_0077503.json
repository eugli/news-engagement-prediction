Keri has been in the trenches the entire time, feeling every little kick, every hiccup and every roll. She's reminded every moment of every day that she's carrying a baby that will die. ... The light at the end of her nine-month tunnel will turn into a darkness she's never felt before a couple hours or days after Eva is born. She's the one that is going to deal with all that comes with having a babyâ€”her milk coming in, the recovery process, etc, but with no snuggly, soft, beautiful newborn to look at to remind you that it was all worth it.\" \nThe decision to carry Eva to full term wasn't just about the potential to save another baby's life, though that reason in itself is helping the couple to the finish line. Keri and Royce also think their daughter deserves to meet her parents, to be held and kissed. \nRELATED: I Completely Regret Revealing My Baby's Gender \nWhile some people would say, \"I wouldn't change anything,\" Royce admits there is so much he wishes he could change. \n\"I want my daughter to be perfect. I want her to blow out her candles on her first birthday. I want to watch her bang her head on our coffee table trying to learn to walk. I want her to run up a cell phone bill texting boys. I want to walk her down an aisle. I want to change it all so, so badly,\" he writes. \"But I can't. This is our reality. And there's no stopping it.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T15:42:25.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
