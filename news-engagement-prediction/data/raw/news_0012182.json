It has won support from Labour MSPs as well as Jeremy Corbyn. \nThe Labour leader told an audience in Glasgow last month that his party would set up a national investment bank at UK level and regional banks for Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland. They would focus on “fast tracking infrastructure spending to building essential transport and digital links to realise our potential”, he said. \nCommon Weal’s call for a Scottish national investment bank is to be debated at the SNP’s spring conference in March, an indication of growing unease within the the party about the private finance model being used by Nicola Sturgeon’s government. \nThe motion from an SNP branch in Angus near Dundee says leaving economic growth and environmental protection “solely in the hands of our private banking and financial sector will be detrimental to present and future living standards of our citizens”. \nCommon Weal said its concerns were heightened after an investigation by the Guardian and the Ferret , an investigative website, revealed the Scottish government would lose about £932m in low-cost public borrowing because its private financing deals had broken EU rules on public spending. \nThe Office for National Statistics said four major construction projects, including the Aberdeen bypass and two new hospitals, had to be counted as public sector spending under those rules. \nAs a result, Scottish ministers had to set aside enough public borrowing to cover their capital costs and those of a fifth project, to build a hospital in Orkney. Their capital costs are expected to total £932m, meaning Holyrood can no longer borrow that amount from public lenders at far lower interest rates for infrastructure projects. \nWhile profits under the SFT system are lower than those in the worst PFI schemes, the Guardian and Ferret investigation found that financiers behind a new hospital overseen by the agency in Dumfries were earning £160m in interest and fees for lending it £242m, at interest rates of up to 11%. \nA Scottish government spokesman said ministers were always exploring innovative ways to fund public projects. There already was an investment fund run by Scottish Enterprise to help companies and a small business fund to distribute money from the EU. \nThe SFT’s private financing models had saved almost £1bn in savings and benefits. “They enable investment in public projects in Scotland to be brought forward more quickly than would otherwise be available through our capital allocation and limited borrowing powers,” the spokesman said. \nAn earlier Guardian investigation found debts and liabilities from all Scotland’s historical and new privately financed projectswas mushrooming. \nScottish public authorities owe £22bn in debt and maintenance costs for historical PFI schemes and has a further £6bn in further commitments through the SFT, which could rise to £9bn with new projects in the pipeline. Those will cost public bodies at least £1.3bn a year in repayment costs and charges by 2025 \nThe new Scottish investment bank would be funded initially by diverting £225m a year from the Scottish government’s capital budget and by offering low-risk bonds to pension funds, councils, housing associations and other investors. \nBen Wray, a co-author of the Common Weal report, said private funding was too expensive, was a burden on the public sector and would continue to be so in the future. “UK government austerity is bad enough; reducing the budget further through excessive debt repayments is self-inflicted damage,” he added. \nLaurie Macfarlane, an economist at the New Economics Foundation, said: “Meeting the key challenges of the 21st century – climate change, demographic change and economic inequality – requires substantial amounts of long-term and sustainable investment,, but relying on expensive private financing schemes has saddled taxpayers with eye watering costs and poor quality outcomes.” \nJim Cuthbert, a former chief statistician for the Scottish Office of the UK government, welcomed the proposal but warned that its supporters had to be sure that setting up a publicly funded bank would increase the total borrowing available to the government. \n“This paper deals with an area which is overdue for attention,” said the economist. “The proposals would represent a very welcome shift away from financial engineering to real engineering.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T09:03:24.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
