Growth and consolidation \nThe end of the Civil War in the United States saw an unparalleled economic boom, fuelled by new technologies and industries—railways, steel and oil, and the growth of new cities. \nFor many of these new industries, any semblance of a free market was swiftly replaced by oligopoly. Rear Vision examines the Gilded Age of America. \nIn industry after industry, there was a period of very intense competition, followed by very rapid consolidation of corporate power in the hands of a very small number of people. \nOne example was the Rockefeller Group and oil. \"What you have is Rockefeller introducing new methods of extraction of oil, new methods of transportation of oil—and that gives him increased market power,\" says Adrian Wooldridge, the management editor of The Economist. \nWith steel, the same principle applied: Andrew Carnegie, quick to recognise the importance of chemistry in steel manufacturing, gained a competitive advantage that allowed him to drive his competitors out of business.

In the years since, just as in the Gilded Age, consolidation has hit the tech sector. \n\"The first consolidation is Bill Gates [and Windows], but now you have the same thing going on with Google, Facebook and, of course, with Amazon,\" says Mr Wooldridge. \"The parallels are astonishing.\" The rise of the corporation \nThe Gilded Age saw the reorganisation not just of industries, but the way industries behaved. For centuries, mercantilism had reigned as colonial powers battled with each other to export luxury goods, but the late 19th century saw the emergence of the corporation. \n\"The whole point of a corporation is that it allows you to aggregate capital from multiple sources for a single purpose,\" says TJ Stiles, a historian and biographer of Gilded Age business magnate Cornelius Vanderbilt.

(Wikimedia Commons: Public Domain) \nAmerica soon reaped the rewards of its corporate expansion. \"Great works, great productivity, tremendous advances in overall wealth … you have enormous networks constructed, you have very expensive new technology,\" says Mr Stiles. \nHowever, income disparity soared, as it has in recent decades. According to Mr Wooldridge, the concentration of wealth in the United States is about the same today as it was in 1929. Alienation of workers \nIn the 1850s in the United States, companies were essentially small trading businesses, workers had a personal relationship with their bosses. By the dawn of the 20th century, that has all changed. \"Companies had become absolutely gigantic,\" Wooldridge says. \nHe cites the example of US Steel, the Gilded Age corporation that employed 250,000 Americans—more, at the time, than were employed by the army and navy combined. \nIt was all controlled by Andrew Carnegie, before moving to a more complicated structure after 1901. \nThis was a new development in human history. Bosses became distant beings, and their workers became alienated, and in turn aggressive. \n\"From the 1870s onwards you have wave after wave of an industrial unrest which becomes very aggressive, very violent,\" Mr Wooldridge says. \nThe alienation of workers was also an issue in the 2016 presidential election—not because of the size of corporations, but rather due to companies sending their workforces overseas. \nCompanies like Apple and Google—\"In many ways the US Steel of its day,\" Mr Wooldridge says—do almost all of their manufacturing abroad. \n\"If you employ very few people, your commitment to the rest of your nation state is very small.\" Companies and structures outside the law \nIn the 19th century, nascent titans of industry faced almost no regulation. The owners of the corporations virtually set their own limits. \n\"They create the rules as quickly as possible,\" says Mr Wooldridge. \"We built this railway, we built this steel mill, we've created this oil company, now you have to deal.\" Photo: Tech companies such as Uber have been a consolidating force in modern economies, similar to the railroads and steel mills of the 19th century. (Pexels.com) \nArguably, we are seeing the same situation today. Companies like Airbnb or Uber, Wooldridge says, move into a city, creates new businesses, tests the old regulations, denounces them as irrelevant, and puts pressure on regulators to operate from a position of weakness. \n\"It's a fait accompli,\" Mr Wooldridge. \"It is basically changing the rules of regulation around the world.\" Buying political influence \nWith their increasing wealth, the corporate barons of the 19th century—Rockefeller, Carnegie, and Vanderbilt—also gained great political influence. \n\"By the 1890s, it was said of John D Rockefeller that the only thing he hadn't done to the Pennsylvania legislature was refine it,\" says Leon Fink, distinguished professor of history at the University of Illinois, Chicago. \nBut corruption also went the other way: legislators would threaten to pass laws with the goal of extorting money from corporations. Lobbyists existed, but not as we would know them today. \n\"Lobbyists acted on behalf of legislators,\" TJ Stiles says. They would approach corporations, demanding under-the-table payments in exchange for not passing laws that might harm the interests of corporations. \nMr Stiles doesn't have to look far to see parallels with today. \n\"You see a private businessman becoming president who is out there attacking private companies—in some cases in ways that will benefit him personally. \n\"So we see a return to this earlier form of corruption in which a public official is coercing private companies to do his personal bidding.\" How corporate power was curbed \nBy the beginning of the 20th century, the excessive disparity between industrialists and ordinary people lead to demands for checks on unregulated wealth and power in America. \nThe reaction began in rural America, as a protest against the railroads. \nFarmers in the Midwest and Great Plains regions needed railroads to have any hope of transporting their goods. But the monopoly rail companies abused their bargaining position. \nAccording to Mr Wooldridge, this was the beginning of the end for unfettered power. \"You get populism rising up and railing against the robber barons, the railroad barons.\" \nThis discontent then spread to steel mills and oil refineries. Workers, pushed together in factories, started to organise. There were violent protests. The National Guard were deployed as strikebreakers. There was, Wooldridge says, \"a real sense that the country [was] beginning to fall apart\".

(Getty Images) \nOut of this period of discontent emerged the extraordinary figure of Teddy Roosevelt, a Republican and member of the upper class. \nHe argued that to stop civil disorder and prevent a revolution, America needed a more powerful interventionist state. The push for social reform—and the disciplining the great corporations of the day—came from the right.

Leon Fink argues that while Roosevelt did curb the power of corporations, he didn't really bust them. \nWhile laws were created to limit monopolies, they didn't really break big capitalism. \"I don't think that the evils which people seized on in the period ever were fully tamed,\" Mr Fink says. \nThe notion of crony capitalism hasn't gone away. \"That's an issue at the moment,\" says Mr Fink, \"with the new presidency of Donald Trump.\" \nFink questions how Trump will be able to manage his private accumulations, given his public position. \nAgain, Mr Wooldridge sees parallels with the Gilded Age. \"I suspect what's going to happen with Trump is exactly what happened with Roosevelt.\" \nWooldridge predicts a new corporatism—an attempt to use corporate power in a way that is nation-building. \n\"I see quite strong similarities between the corporatism that resulted from popular discontent in the early 20th century and the corporatism that is emerging now.\" First posted February 01, 2017 12:42:43 Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:20:29.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
