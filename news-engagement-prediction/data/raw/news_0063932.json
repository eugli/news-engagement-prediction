This spells bad news for Mr Trump because he’s likely to “fix the party” which is in desperate need of an overhaul. \nThis in turn means there is unlikely to be a repeat of the party’s disastrous performance last year. Moore writes momentum is building against President Trump.

New York could offer free college education while Hawaii can enact its own climate change laws, he writes. \nThe next thing to do is run for office because “Congress needs people like you” and the only way to fix things is to get in there and do it yourself. \nHis last two points include becoming the media by using the internet to promote your own empire by sharing information while encouraging people to join the army of comedians taking aim at the President. \n“Trump’s Achilles heel is his massively thin skin. He can’t take mockery. So we all need to MOCK HIM UP!,” he writes in his last point, adding the President won’t be able to take it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:25:28.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
