While yesterday's Samsung press conference only showed us the Galaxy S8 and S8+'s reveal date , today a new leak provides us with what could possibly be our first video look at the upcoming devices. While the video itself is pretty short, it still shows us a few key details. Where we previously saw only a blurry glimpse at the two phones' user interface, here it's in full display: The on-screen buttons are, just as suspected, not the same as stock Android, and in true Samsung fashion are also reversed. Also visible is the TouchWiz launcher, which looks almost unchanged from its S7 counterpart, save for a new, curved corners search bar. We also get a view of the S8+'s always-on display, which shows a new, vertical style watch interface. As for the devices themselves, they look pretty much the same as previous rumors have suggested : even though they're both equipped with covers, we still get a glimpse of their overall design, including the fingerprint scanner placed next to the rear camera, and the front-facing iris scanner . We also get to see how the two devices stack next to each other, which really helps show the difference in size between the two otherwise largely identical phones. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ will be officially revealed on March 29, and we'll be keeping you posted on the latest news until then.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:42:59.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
