On Wednesday, he revealed on his Instagram page that he would not be able to make the Atlanta Supercross, despite undergoing physical therapy each day to try and get back on track. \nWebb hopes to be back on his Yamaha at the Toronto Supercross in two weeks’ time. \nAnother 450SX rider who went down hard during the Minneapolis Supercross was Justin Bogle. Fortunately for fans of the Suzuki rider, he posted to social media on Sunday that – despite having a tough night in Minneapolis – he will be at this weekend’s event in Atlanta. \nAs for HRC Honda rider Ken Roczen, he began this week optimistic that he had just one surgery on his arm left from his crash at the Angel Stadium in Anaheim on Jan. 21. However, while surgeons were able to successfully complete the operation on his wrist on Monday, he had to wait until Wednesday to have his elbow fixed up. \nFortunately for Roczen, he says he is “feeling good” and that he “couldn’t ask for a better doctor” as he continues to try and get healed up for his eventual return. \nThe latest injury updates from Webb, Bogle and Roczen are all posted below.
