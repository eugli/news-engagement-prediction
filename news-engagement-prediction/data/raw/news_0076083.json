The actress, who is up for Best Actress in Loving, wore the sparkling headpiece with short slicked back hair style. It's a move straight out of the timeless actress playbook. The tiara has been the piece du jour for actresses since Elizabeth Taylor slipped one on for her step on the red carpet turn in 1957, followed closely by Eva Gardner in 1960. Fast forward years later, in the more-is-more excess mood of the nineties, Selma Hayek brought the piece back onto the red carpet, wearing a glimmering headband perched on top of her larger-than-life bouffant bun in 1997. The more paired-back version of the hair accessory came during the 2000s: Natalie Portman wore the a thin diamond vine headband on the 2005 Academy Awards red carpet and Lupita N'yongo also opted for a minimalist tiara in 2014 to snag her award for Best Supporting Actress in Twelve Years a Slave. Nonetheless, Negga's tiara stands out: The rubies cleverly match her red lip and of course, the red carpet. Here, see five time the tiara made a cameo at The Academy Awards.
