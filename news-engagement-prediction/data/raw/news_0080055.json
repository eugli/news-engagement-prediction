Cheers.\" \nHis sister called 999, reporting that Saunders had arrived home with blood on him and had a gun, saying that he had killed Miss Morgan and Mr Simmons. \nAt 6.30am Saunders posted \"F***\" on Facebook, later adding: \"Product of society.\" \nPolice attended his home and arrested Saunders, who told them: \"I'm sorry, you know sometimes you just snap,\" before asking \"are they both dead?\". (Photo: Wales News) (Photo: Wales News) \nIn custody, Saunders asked: \"Are they both dead? I just want to know for peace of mind.\" \nA post-mortem examination found Mr Simmons and Miss Morgan both suffered eight stab wounds. \nSentencing, Justice Nicola Davies said: \"Without warning, you approached Lee Simmons from behind, grabbed him and stabbed him in the back. \n\"You were responsible for the fatal injuries which led to the deaths of Lee Simmons and Zoe Morgan. \n\"They had their whole lives ahead of them. In a sustained and brutal attack, you ended those lives and took away the futures of Zoe Morgan and Lee Simmons.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:10:41.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
