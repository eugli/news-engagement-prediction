The Arsenal defender believes they can still win the Premier League title this season despite falling way behind Chelsea. \nArsene Wenger's charges are now a staggering 12-points off the summit of the league as The Blues maintain their stranglehold on the league. \nFollowing back-to-back defeats in the league, Arsenal are pretty much out of the running for the coveted title. \nWhich includes their 3-1 defeat to Chelsea with Eden Hazard putting on a masterclass. Oh, on the subject of the mercurial Belgium. \nLook away, Shkodran... - Raph. (@Iwobiesque) February 4, 2017 \nBut the chips aren't down inside the Gunners' camp. Mustafi isn't discouraged and even feels that his side can still mount a challenge while eventually winning it. \n\"I think it's going to be more difficult than it was before but I'm a believer. I don't give up .\" The German told Sky Sports. \n\"As long as it's possible we're going to fight for it, and in the end we will see and if we're lucky enough and good enough to go for it or not.\" \nWhile admitting it was disappointing losing at home to Watford, not to mention the thumping to the hands of the league leaders. \n\"We were disappointed as well with losing at Chelsea, which was a completely different game.\" \nI could've sworn it was Hector Bellerin who got hit in the head?!
