Durant left his running mate in Oklahoma City for the Golden State Warriors in a controversial decision that stunned NBA players, executives and fans alike . The Warriors overcame a 3-1 deficit to eliminate the Thunder in last season’s Western Conference Finals. They went on to blow a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals , falling to the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 7. The Finals loss paved the way for Durant to join Stephen Curry , Klay Thompson and Draymond Green in Golden State. The Warriors and Thunder have played twice this season, each time at Oracle Arena in Oakland. Golden State won those two contests by a combined 47 points.
