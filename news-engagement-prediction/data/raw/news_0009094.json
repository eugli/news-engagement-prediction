The program grants work permits and temporary protection from deportation in two-year increments. President Donald Trump vowed to cancel that program as he campaigned for the White House, though he has tempered his comments about DACA in recent weeks.\nAbout 23,000 people living in Georgia have been approved for DACA so far. Some of them are suing the Georgia Board of Regents, arguing they are legally present in the U.S. through DACA and should therefore be allowed to pay in-state tuition. Fulton County Superior Chief Judge Gail Tusan agreed with them in her recent ruling. The Board of Regents is appealing.\n“This is good news for these DACA students, as we knew we would end up at the Georgia Supreme Court,” said Charles Kuck, an attorney for the plaintiffs. “Our DACA students will keep fighting for the chance to attend the Georgia colleges and universities they help fund with their tax dollars.”\nThe Georgia Attorney General’s Office had no immediate comment Friday afternoon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T09:00:01.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
