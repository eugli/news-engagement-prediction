We pay our taxes. We have children who study in college,\" said Adela, who spoke on the condition that only her first name be used because she is concerned for her well-being. \nAdela did not identify the man in the video, which was sent to The Dallas Morning News by a friend on Facebook who said Adela works at the Wal-Mart's optical center. \nThe man had complained he couldn't see well with the glasses he was picking up at the store on North MacArthur Boulevard near Interstate 635. \nAfter Adela referred him to a doctor to check his prescription, the man demanded to be helped by a white employee. \n\"You're being racist,\" Adela said she told him. \nShe went to get her supervisor, who is white, but she was busy on a conference call. \nAdela said she began recording the video on her cellphone after the man complained about a black woman in an electric wheelchair. \n“Look at that, who do you think pays her hospital bills?\" the man says on the video. \n\"I don't know, you can ask her,\" Adela says. \n\"I do,\" he says pointing at himself. \"I pay her hospital bills. She’s a foreigner. She came over here. She got sick and fat and obese, and she can’t do anything. She can’t work,\" he says. \"But I have to pay her bills. See what I mean? Am I fat and obese? I go to work every day. I pay taxes.” \nAdela responds: “OK, me, too. I pay my own taxes, too.” \n“All of these foreigners are living off of us good working white people. Yes, I’m just telling you the truth,\" he says, laughing. \"It’s all right. I know you ain’t leaving. I know you’re here to stay. Y’all should go to your own countries and fix up your own countries.” \n“OK, sir, I don’t want to hear that anymore. That’s it,” the employee says as her supervisor comes to assist the man. \nAfter the man left, Adela said she showed the video to her supervisor. \n\"I told her I was in shock,\" she said. \"I didn't know what to do, whether to cry. I felt very bad.\" \nHer supervisor asked two Wal-Mart employees to watch for the man, but Adela said he later called to cancel a follow-up appointment. \nAdela, 46, said she'd never faced discrimination the way she did last week. Before she became a citizen, she was a legal permanent resident of the United States. \nA manager working Sunday at the the Wal-Mart said he was unaware of the incident. He said such situations are investigated internally and directed questions to the corporate media office, which could not be reached for comment.
