Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts ❤ — jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 23, 2017 \n“I guess I just want to enlighten him on what my sister, I’ve seen her go through every single day in school and people just like her, what they deal with,” the 16-year-old told ABC News. “The discrimination, it’s terrible.” I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide. #sisterlove — jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 22, 2017 \nJuliet Evancho, who was born as a male named Jacob, said she would bring a message of understanding to their proposed meeting with Mr. Trump. \n“When I heard about it I was very disappointed and I realized that we would need to take action in order to enlighten the administration on everything,” the 18-year-old said. \nMs. Evancho said the bathroom policies are unclear in public schools, which makes it easier for discrimination to go unchecked. \n“I’ve had things thrown at me,” she said. “I’ve had people say pretty horrible things and the unsafe environment is just very unhealthy so I feel like Donald Trump needs to know that being in such an unsafe environment won’t do any good not only for the transgenders and the LGBTQ community but as well as everyone as a whole.” \nJackie faced a wave of backlash for performing at Mr. Trump’s inauguration but said Thursday that she has no regrets. \n“The reason why I did sing for the inauguration was not politics,” she said. “It was for the honor and privilege to perform for my country and that will stay the same I think.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:52:49.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
