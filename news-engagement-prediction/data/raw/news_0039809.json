And the Missouri attorney general warned residents to be wary of abuses with contract-for-deed sales. Lucy Morris, a lawyer for Harbour Portfolio, did not respond to a request for comment. Harbour had argued that the consumer agency’s subpoena was too burdensome and that it sought too much information. In its investigation, the bureau has also been examining National Asset Advisors and a related firm, National Asset Mortgage; both work with Harbour Portfolio to sell the homes. After the 2008 housing crisis, Harbour Portfolio bought around 7,000 single-family homes in bulk sales from Fannie Mae, the government-controlled mortgage finance firm. Harbour paid $10,000 or less for each of these homes in most cases, then sold them “as is” to buyers for sometimes as much as four or five times the purchase price, The Times found in its investigation last year. Judge Edmunds said in a 12-page ruling that the agency’s authority to issue the subpoena was “not ‘plainly lacking,’” borrowing language that Harbour had used in its challenge. “There are plausible grounds to believe that respondents may have information related to a violation” of the federal Truth in Lending Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, she noted. \nAdvertisement Still, the judge, who was appointed in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush, did not address whether the home financing companies had done anything wrong because the agency had yet to bring an enforcement action.

Credit Yuri Gripas/Reuters Sarah Edelman, director of housing policy for the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said, “This is an example of how the bureau stands up for Americans — it is a nimble agency that doesn’t fall victim to the typical loopholes that companies use to get around the rules Congress has put in place to protect our pocketbooks.” Yet the ruling comes at a time when the future of the bureau is very much in doubt. Mr. Trump has not yet said what he intends to do with the agency, but he has broadly criticized the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which created the agency and overhauled financial regulation after the financial crisis. The president pledged “to do a big number” on Dodd-Frank and signed an executive order indicating his administration’s intention to chisel away at major provisions of the legislation.
