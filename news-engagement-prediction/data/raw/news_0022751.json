I’m afraid he’s going to burn out.” \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump’s travel ban: What’s next in the legal battle? \nGolfman confirmed Tuesday that the school has received double the number of inquiries it usually gets from students in the United States since Donald Trump was elected president Nov. 8 – and she said there was another spike after he announced the ban on Jan. 27. \nSo far, the school has waived the $120 fee for at least 54 applicants. \nGolfman said she is not aware of any other Canadian universities currently making a similar offer, but she has heard others are expected to follow Memorial’s lead. Federal court denies appeal by Justice department on Trump travel ban reversal decision \nMost of the inquiries from foreign-born students are coming from those with Iranian citizenship. On campus, Iranians represent the largest group of international students, next to those of Chinese descent. \nIn addition to students from the seven countries, Memorial made the same offer to American students. \nGolfman said the university wanted to respond quickly to Trump’s actions. \nREAD MORE: Refugees brave freezing cold, walk to Canada to escape Donald Trump’s USA \n“Following on the heels of Canada admitting (so many) Syrian families, this is a logical extension of all of that,” she said. \nThe school issued a statement Jan. 30, saying it was deeply concerned about Trump’s executive order, which prevented individuals from the seven countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days. \nTrump’s actions pose a “significant threat to the free flow of people and ideas and to the values of diversity, inclusion and openness, hallmarks of a strong and healthy society,” the statement said. \n“Our university community is stronger, more vibrant, innovative and progressive because of the diversity of the people who choose to engage in teaching, learning and research activities here.” \nThe university’s statement said the order has affected international studies, academic conferences, and in some cases family relationships in Newfoundland and Labrador. \nThough Trump’s order has been suspended by a U.S. court, Golfman said the university has no plans to lift its offer. \nShe said the gesture could mean a great deal to students spooked by the decree, which applies to people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. \nU.S. President Donald J.
