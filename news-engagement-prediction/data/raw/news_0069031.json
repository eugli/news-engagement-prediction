(Photo: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP) More Beyoncé is calling for fans to get in formation and support the LGBTQ community. On Wednesday the Trump administration rescinded protections for transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms matching their gender identity. The “Love Drought” singer took to social media on Thursday and posted a message to her 64 million followers amid President Trump’s broken promise to fight for the LGBTQ community, saying LGBTQ students “need to know we support them.” Beyoncé also shared a link to GLSEN’s 100 Days of Kindness challenge. GLSEN was founded by a group of teachers and aims to ensure the safety of LGBTQ students, while working to improve an education system that too frequently allows them to fall through the cracks. Beyoncé is hardly the only celebrity to speak out in support of the LGBTQ community. Laverne Cox called in to The View on Thursday to rail against Trump’s ruling.

That is what this is about,” the Orange Is the New Black star stated. “It is not a states’ rights issue, it is a civil rights issue.” Ellen DeGeneres tweeted , “In a country where the rights of people and animals are being removed, I want to be a voice of kindness and light. I hope you’ll join me.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:02:40.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
