DeRozan missed the game with an ankle injury. \nHowever, as seen below, even though DeRozan didn't suit up for the game, he was still waiting to congratulate his friend in the tunnel once Lowry had finished all his on-court media obligations: \nAfter the two exchange a hug, Lowry tells DeRozan he almost celebrated with the famous Sam Cassell \"Onions\" dance , which would have likely led to a fine from the NBA. Still, that would have been fun to watch and it's safe to say DeRozan would have supported his friend's choice. \nThe win improved the Raptors to 30-19, half a game behind the Boston Celtics for second place in the Eastern Conference. Toronto trails the No. 1 seed Cleveland Cavaliers by three games. \nDeRozan's ankle injury isn't expected to keep him out much longer, so the Raptors should be back to full strength soon and could make a run at the struggling Cavaliers for the top spot in the East.
