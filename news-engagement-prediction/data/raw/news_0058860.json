The walls are decorated with colorful chalk art, making Pop-Tarts look like pop art (get it?!), while boxes of the snack food fill the window display, beckoning passerby to come on in and enjoy everyone's favorite toaster pastry. Even better: the menu is packed with cool twists on the treats that magically appear in a tiny locker after you place your order. \n\"We opened Kellogg's NYC as a cereal café last summer, and we've been really excited about the success we've had with the café, and that it's allowing fans to be inspired by cereal and think about cereal differently,\" Angela Gusse, Marketing Director, Pop-Tarts at Kellogg Company, told Glamour . \"We wanted to do the exact same thing with Pop-Tarts. The brand is all about fun and creativity and we wanted to bring that to life for our fans through the creativity of the café.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:08:22.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
