I think we’re each taking time to make personal improvements. I hope our fans will continue to love and support us. I feel very apologetic towards our fans and am always very thankful for them. I will work hard to constantly improve.” \nYeeun also talked about the show and said, “Although this [press conference] is my first official activity since the disbandment, filming for the show began in November of 2016. Since I like both vacations and music, I decided to film with an open heart and mind. I met many good friends and colleagues through this program so it was a meaningful experience for me.” \n“Cross Country” will air every Saturday at 11 p.m. KST starting February 25.
