Save AOL \nGaming laptops used to be an outlier in the world of portable computing. When the rest of the market was focused on extending battery life, gaming laptops doubled down on raw power and thick frames designed for better airflow. Trying to find a small gaming machine that didn't sacrifice power for portability was a fool's errand. Today, things are different. Gaming laptops can be thin , have enough battery life to survive a plane flight, and double as a productivity and entertainment machine with few compromises. The best recent example of this to cross my desk is the Alienware 13, a small, powerful gaming laptop that does almost everything right. \nThe New Alienware 13 isn't just a strong example of a compact gaming notebook. It's also the brand's first outing with an Intel 7th-generation \"Kaby Lake\" Core CPU, which promises to push 4K content to the laptop's screen without decimating battery life . Combined with the strides NVIDIA made with its mobile GPU platform last year, that alone makes 2017 a good year for PC gamers to consider upgrading their mobile battle station -- but there's more to love about the Alienware 13 than just its new internals. Hardware \nSomewhere between the garish, brightly colored accents of ASUS' ROG Strix laptop and the thin aluminum shell of the Razer Blade Pro , you'll find Alienware's latest notebook -- a machine with enough flair to identify itself as a serious gaming rig, yet still subtle enough to keep it from being an eyesore. Its simple matte black finish lets it blend in as a normal work laptop, but its anodized aluminum lid, subtly angled front lip and Dell's AlienFX lighting lend it just the right amount of attitude. \nAt a glance, the machine looks like a minor tweak of Alienware's previous gaming laptops , albeit with less LED lighting, but there is one major change: the screen. Dell has moved the Alienware 13's display about an inch closer to the user. This is actually a practical design aesthetic: It leaves a 1.3-inch lip behind the screen for heat exhaust, making the laptop's bottom a little cooler when playing games. \nThat lip is also home to most of the machine's connections, including an Ethernet jack, mini DisplayPort, HDMI socket and a USB Type-C Thunderbolt port. This is also where you'll plug in the laptop's AC adapter and the Alienware Graphics Amplifier , if you happen to own one. Users who just want to plug in a mouse can find a full-size USB 3.0 port on either side of the machine, as well as two audio jacks on the left and an extra USB Type-C connection on the right. \nThe smooth, soft plastic coating that drapes the laptop's chassis is a bit of an Alienware standard, and I'm still a fan. The rubber-like surface dulls the corners of the machine's body, and feels almost silky to the touch. Best of all, it doesn't collect unsightly fingerprints like laptops built from harder materials. Keyboard and trackpad \nThat same rubberized coating extends to the keyboard, which lends the Alienware 13's keys a soft, almost luxurious feel. The buttons themselves are a joy to type on, falling 2.2mm and landing on a firm, but springy steel baseboard. Like any keyboard bearing the Alienware TacX branding, it promises millions of keystrokes in durability and full anti-ghosting capabilities, but to me, it's the style that really makes it stand out. Unlike most modern laptops, the Alienware 13's keyboard features full sized keycaps that meet edge-to-edge, with no space between the keys. It's a design you might have seen on a machine made a decade ago, before island-style keyboards became the norm. For me, it's a nostalgic comfort -- a style I've always found easier to type and game on that has nonetheless fallen by the wayside. \nThe Alienware 13's touchpad gets almost everything right as well. It's a spacious mousing surface that can navigate multitouch gestures without messing up, a feat that's unfortunately still impressive on many Windows machines. The buttons are great too; they fall with a firm, but quiet click that feels just right. At worst, its AlienFX lighting feature activates at inconvenient times, causing the entire touchpad to glow if my palm ever brushes it while I'm typing. This contact never moved the cursor, but it the repeated, unexpected lighting can be distracting. I turned it off and moved on. Display and sound \nMost gaming machines I review manage a passing audio grade by doing the bare minimum: offering loud, clear sound without distortion or cracking. The Alienware 13 is one of the rare few that actually impressed me. During my gaming sessions, I kept hearing odd sounds coming from my front door. I'd check the porch, and there would be nothing there. Back at my desk, the sound would pipe up again. After a few fruitless trips to the front of the house, I figured out what was happening: The laptop was somehow \"throwing\" sound across the room like a ventriloquist. The Alienware 13 has built-in surround sound that actually kind of works. \nThis was a surprise. Most attempts to simulate spatial sound in a laptop fall flat, but Alienware's Virtual Surround had me instinctively glancing left and right to see where a sound might have come from. It's a clear differentiation from simple left-and-right sound separation too, with the ability to project sound to areas very close to the laptop's chassis, or all the way across the room. Like most fake surround systems, it fails to simulate having speakers behind the viewer, but it's still a cut above the average laptop audio setup. \nMy review unit came outfitted with a 13.3-inch 2,560 x 1,440 OLED touch display , and it's simply gorgeous. It offers everything you'd expect from a great screen: vivid colors, wide viewing angles and excellent contrast. It's a strong example of the kind of difference display technology can make; OLED panels simply produce deeper blacks than their IPS counterparts. \nStill, there are some drawbacks. The screen's blacks are so dark that it's almost hard to tell where the display ends and the its dark, wide bevel begins, which can make the screen look a little smaller than it really is. I also had to dial Battlefield 1 's brightness calibration dial to 93 percent to make the test logo visible. Deep blacks indeed.
