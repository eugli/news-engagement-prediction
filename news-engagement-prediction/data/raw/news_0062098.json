It's not like the paint is peeling off, but we've noticed a few superficial scrapes already. \nI can already tell I'm probably going to want to use the Pro Controller to play Breath of the Wild . If you're like me and you'd prefer to have the gaming experience closest to that of an Xbox One or PlayStation 4, you can already tack $70 on top of the cost of the Switch. \nWe'll have a full review of the Nintendo Switch next week.
