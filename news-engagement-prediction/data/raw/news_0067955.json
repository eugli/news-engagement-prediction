That is a good call.\" \nThe South Australian Government had said that the trees and some contaminated soil needed to be removed as part of remediation work on the site and that 400 new trees would be planted. \nBut Mr Parnell said removing soil from the entire site was an \"exaggerated response\" to a contamination problem that could be handled in other ways. \n\"The site is not a toxic wasteland and clearly the DAC wasn't convinced either,\" he said. \nThe development is going ahead on 16.5 hectares of land surrounding the Glenside Hospital. \nIt was sold in July 2016 to Cedar Woods for $25.8 million. \nAt the time, then minister for Housing and Urban Development Stephen Mullighan said the sale would help pay for a new mental health facility on the site. \nResidents raised concerns the project would cause traffic congestion and damage the area's heritage character.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:42:47.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
