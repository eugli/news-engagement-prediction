With Chelsea's lead cut to eight points and Manchester City cruising on the back of a four-win run, is it time to reassess the title race?\nWhere should the club be loading its priorities as the season hots up? Is it time to get practical and cut to chasing the most realistic targets, or can the club still contemplate challenging on all fronts?\nCertainly four wins, added to a scintillating display against Tottenham that should also have delivered the full three points, suggests City have woken up since the 4-0 hammering at Everton. There is nothing like a good slap in the face to bring you back to your senses, after all.\nThe display at Goodison Park had been lethargic and disjointed, boding ill for the immediate future and the club's prospects of challenging on any front with major intent. Since then, the penny seems to have dropped. Evidence was there at the Vitality Stadium in Bournemouth on Monday night that all are now singing from the same hymn sheet.\nBoth Pep Guardiola and midfielder Yaya Toure mentioned that the long rocky road to understanding City's new raison d'etre was finally being negotiated with success.\nPassing for the sake of it has been replaced by the use of nous, the penetration of the wings and the forward thrust that is beginning to present the strikers with more opportunities to score.\nWith Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling terrorising defenders down the flanks, the possibilities are countless. The sad demise of Gabriel Jesus, laid low by a dreaded metatarsal break after such a bright start, is a cruel blow sweetened by his obvious replacement, Sergio Aguero. If ever there has been a reasonably handy stand-in, it is the stocky little Argentinean.\nCity, thus, are beginning to fire. It has taken a long time and -- in the coach's words -- perhaps some of the blame for that can be laid at his door, attempting to coax too many structural changes out of his squad prematurely.\nIt has been a tricky phase of reorganisation for many, but the signs are now evident that progress is being made. Unmatched in the Premier League on the front foot, City's attacking instincts are sharp and predatory, even shorn of Jesus. With the two wide men in such exuberant form, backed by the decisive skills of David Silva and the keen eye of Kevin De Bruyne, the addition of a fully firing Aguero to the mix could really set the cat among the pigeons.\nSilva's contribution in particular cannot be underestimated. The little Spaniard has successfully found his top form, imperious in his ball possession, innate ability to see the most effective pass and to shrug off any amount of robust attention from lesser mortals. He can put his foot in too, when necessary, a trait often lost in the endless eulogies about his deft touch and peerless vision.\nManchester City have cut the gap at the top to eight points. Further back, the addition of Willy Caballero in goal has made a significant difference, making the defence look more confident about its own tasks. John Stones was faultless against Bournemouth, again proving that he will blossom into a mainstay of this young, developing side given the right circumstances.\nCity look next towards the FA Cup this weekend, with a challenging trip to West Yorkshire to face a buoyant Huddersfield Town, before renewing their love-hate relationship with the Champions League the following midweek against a dangerous and super-confident Monaco.\nRather than seeing these as distractions from the main aim of hauling in Chelsea's long-held lead, City must push on in all directions. This side is now packed with the exuberance of youth, backed up by the wily heads of Silva, Toure and the impressively consistent Fernandinho. The gap to Chelsea may well begin to be frittered away some more in the coming weeks and if it gets any smaller than at present, Chelsea's mental strength will come under the microscope.\nWith Barcelona almost certainly out of the Champions League after their 4-0 mauling against Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their round of 16 tie, the way to Champions League glory has also just opened up a fraction. All is to play for there too.\nIn the meantime, attention falls on the trophy that best epitomises City's return to the forefront of English football. The FA Cup win against Stoke under Roberto Mancini in 2011 still sends a shiver down the spines of all City fans, who witnessed the club emerge into the light after decades decorated only by pain and mishap.\nThe fact that there has been a far greater clamour for tickets to see the tie at Huddersfield than the games with Monaco tells its own story. The FA Cup is just as important as the league title and European glory in this season of growing expectations.\nSimon is one of ESPN FC's Manchester City bloggers.
