My absence is out of my respect for the people of my country, and those of the other six nations who have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the US. Dividing the world into the 'us' and 'our enemies' categories creates fear. A deceitful justification for aggression and war. These wars prevent democracy and human rights in countries which have themselves been victims of aggression. Filmmakers can turn their cameras to capture shared human qualities, and break stereotypes of various nationalities and religions. They create empathy between us and others. An empathy we need today more than ever.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:41:14.991+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
