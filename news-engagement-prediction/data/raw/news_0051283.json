With the hassles of dealing with jargon, documentation, red-tape and fragmented information associated with consumer financial products, choosing and purchasing one has so far been perceived as a highly daunting process. This is where a Wish Expert comes in; conceptually it goes beyond mere customer service or relationship management, but is envisioned as an end-to-end ‘enabler’, the company said in a press release. \nYou may also watch: \nA Wishfin customer has to express a desire for a financial product and choose a Wish Expert from the panel. The chosen Wish Expert will then take the customer through the entire journey of fulfilling their wish – answering queries, helping choose a financial product, guiding through the application process and expediting disbursal. What makes the service stand apart is the focus on accountability and consumer preference – A Wish Expert is not assigned but selected by the customer based on the performance ratings of the consultants on the panel, which is driven by feedback shared by earlier customers of their experience with the consultants. \nRishi Mehra, Founder, and CEO, Wishfin, said: “At Wishfin, all our actions are centered towards users’ wishes, but wishes without finance remain just that- wishes. With Wish Experts, we intend to eliminate all financial obstacles coming in the way of our customers’ wishes, though the final decision will always be the customers’. Our avant-garde technology, financial expertise, and prudent advice will enable users to turn their wishes into reality.” \nYou may also watch: \nThe service has attracted great response in the one month since inception. A lot more customers are choosing to go ahead with financial solutions to fulfill their wishes, and are expressing much higher levels of satisfaction, he said.
