Being a pro at ramp walks, Malaika sizzled as she walked for the star designer. The actress looked stunning and turned a lot of heads when she walked graciously on the ramp. \nWearing a red simple and modern choli paired with a yellow lehenga , Maliaka couldn’t have looked any better. The lehenga had a lot of intricate embellishments and floral embroidery. She completed her look with some jewellery and a shimmery dupatta . \nDivya’s collection was fantastic. It had simple yet elegant designs with a lot of detailing work. We saw floral embroidery, shimmery embellishments, frilled bottoms and a lot of handicraft technique. The designers line had dresses, sarees, ghagra and lehenga cholis and layered skirts \nApart from Malaika, Neerja actor Jim Sarbh also walked the ramp for Khanijo during the first show. The actor looked dapper as he took to the runway. He sported a light yellow jacket with similar pants and shirt.
