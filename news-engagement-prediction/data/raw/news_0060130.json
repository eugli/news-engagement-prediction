In today's meeting with them, he'll check their work. \nListening in on of of the sessions, CNBC reported that one of the CEOs said that a border adjustment tax would create 2 million high-paying jobs -- only to be quickly interrupted by another CEO who pointed out it would also expose 42 million jobs to destruction. Under the rules of engagement reporters were not allowed to quote participants by name. \nTwo \"very\" senior administration officials also discussed how vocational schools were larger parts of high school education when they were growing up and they wanted to see that brought back, CNBC reported. \nRelated: Trump Begins First Week by Meeting With Top Business Leaders \nAlso due today are the outlines of issues and focuses where Trump could make changes to help companies grow in the United States and hire in the United States, a meeting participant told NBC News. \nOn today's lesson plan: splitting into working groups. Each group will get tasked with a different focus, such as taxes, regulation, workforce of the future, environmental issues, and infrastructure and Army Corps of Engineers, the participant said. \nThe CEOs showing up to class today include Michael Dell of Dell Technologies; Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical; Alex Gorsky of Johnson & Johnson; Mark Fields of Ford; Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin; and Mario Longhi of U.S. Steel, according to the White House. \nAlso in attendance from the Administration side will be Vice President Mike Pence, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, and Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon, among others. \nRelated: Many CEOs 'Scared Out of Their Minds,' Won't Speak Out Against Trump \nSome CEOs from the original group \"called in sick\" for scheduling reasons, the participant said. Others may have had to \"drop the class\" due to concerns about customer and employee backlash. \nAt the end of the last meeting in January, Ford CEO Mark Fields told reporters, \"I know I come out with a lot of confidence that the president is very, very serious on making sure that the United States economy is going to be strong, and have policies — tax, regulatory or trade — to drive that.\" Ben Popken ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:33:12.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
