Keith Ellison, in his fight to lead the DNC, is that he was the one who predicted early that I would win! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2017 \nIt’s likely that the prediction Trump is referring to is an interview that Ellison gave on ABC’s This Week back in 2015. Ellison was on to discuss the early stages of the 2016 election, and during his appearance he became one of the first Democratic figures who warned that Trump had a very real chance of winning the Republican nomination, and possibly, the presidency. \n“Anybody from the Democratic side of the fence who’s terrified of the possibility of President Trump better vote, better get active, better get involved because this man has got some momentum,” Ellison said at the time. “We better be ready for the fact that he might be ready for the fact that he may be leading the Republican ticket.” \nEllison has been critical of Trump since he took office last month, and when he noticed today’s tweet, he offered a vow to stop Trump from dividing the country: . @realdonaldtrump , my latest call? America is coming together like never before; we’ll stop your drive to divide us. #libertyjustice4all https://t.co/jifSdJbnrG \n— Rep.
