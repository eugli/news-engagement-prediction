Story continues below \nIn a conference call at around 9 p.m. EST (0200 GMT), the U.S. agency told airlines to operate just as they had before the order, which temporarily had stopped refugees and nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. Individuals from those states who have proper visas can now board U.S.-bound flights, and airlines are working to update their websites to reflect the change, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. \nREAD MORE: NEXUS cards reportedly revoked in wake of Trump travel ban \nThe judge’s temporary restraining order represents a major challenge to U.S. President Donald Trump ‘s action, although his administration could still appeal the ruling and have the policy upheld. \nJudge James Robart, a George W. Bush appointee, made his ruling effective immediately on Friday, suggesting that travel restrictions could be lifted straight away. He is expected to issue a full written ruling over the weekend. \nCBP and Washington-based trade group Airlines for America did not immediately comment. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:38:35.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
