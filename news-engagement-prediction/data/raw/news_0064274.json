Doors were ripped off their hinges; walls broke into jagged holes. The small balcony, where Mohammed liked to sit with his coffee each morning and listen to the birds, disappeared into rubble and dust. \n\nThe demolition order was carried out in the first week of the new year, nearly three months after Israeli forces fatally shot Mohammed's son, 22-year-old Bahaa Allyan, who was accused in a deadly shooting and stabbing attack on a bus in the East Talpiot Jewish settlement last October. \n\n\"The first thing I said was that stone is not more valuable than the soul,\" said Mohammed, a 60-year-old lawyer with gentle eyes. He spoke with Al Jazeera from outside the tent where his family now lives, next to the smashed remains of their home in the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Jabal Mukaber. \n\n\"I also realised that the way they were demolishing the house seemed vengeful. They were trying to do it in a vengeful way,\" Mohammed said, shifting his gaze from the wreckage towards the tent, empty of all but a few thin mattresses and a Palestinian flag. \n\n\"I was losing a place that we grew up in, a place that was home … [but it was] nothing compared to losing my son.\" Dawn was just breaking when... \nA poster of Bahaa Allyan hangs in the ruins of his family's home. For decades, Israeli security forces have used punitive home demolitions as a tool against the Palestinian population. Because the practice deliberately punishes civilians who are living under occupation and have broken no laws, Human Rights Watch has deemed it a war crime . \nAlthough the stated goal of punitive demolitions is to boost security by deterring future violence, research has not borne out this argument. In 2005, an Israeli military committee called for an end to the practice , suggesting that it might actually be fuelling unrest. “To face the death of a child is a bitter thing” A temporary lull in punitive demolitions followed the 2005 order, but the policy picked up again in the summer of 2014, after the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the occupied West Bank. Since then, more than two dozen Palestinian homes have been demolished as a punitive measure, while hundreds more have been razed for other reasons, including the lack of a building permit . \n\n\"We view [punitive demolitions] as a form of collective punishment, which is used against innocent people - family members of Palestinians who have perpetrated horrific attacks against Israelis, but most of whom are either dead or under arrest and expecting very long prison sentences,\" Sarit Michaeli, a spokesperson for the Jerusalem-based human rights organisation B'Tselem, told Al Jazeera. \nAsking Mohammed Allyan: What do you remember the most about your home? \n\"It's a deliberate policy of harming innocent people for the actions of others … In some cases, the measures the authorities use to demolish the homes also harm neighbouring homes, which aren’t even inhabited by anyone related to the perpetrator,” she said. \nMohammed Allyan says Israeli forces demolished his home in a 'vengeful' fashion. \nAlthough families whose homes are targeted for demolition can appeal to halt the order through the Israeli courts, such remedies are almost never granted, Michaeli added. \n\nAl Jazeera asked Israel’s defence ministry to provide information on the state’s strategy of demolishing the homes of suspected attackers, including what process was used to determine the qualifying homes and what evidence existed to show that the strategy worked. Despite numerous emails and phone calls, the ministry did not provide a response. \n\nIn some cases, homes targeted for demolition are razed to the ground, while others are sealed with cement or smashed until they no longer provide shelter - as was the case for Mohammed Allyan. \n\nHis house, located on the middle storey of a short apartment complex, has now been reduced to a jumble of concrete rubble and hanging wires, with only the building’s structural support beams intact. The demolition order was issued in November, and after two appeals failed, it was carried out on January 4. \nThe walls of the family's home were smashed with sledgehammers. \nPosters commemorating Bahaa have been hung in the ruins, where Mohammed’s grandchildren flit in and out. Black butterflies are painted on what is left of the walls. \nYet Mohammed and his family have still not fully grieved their loss, because Israeli authorities have withheld Bahaa’s body, along with the bodies of nine other Palestinians killed since the latest round of violence broke out in October. “To face the death of a child is a bitter thing,” Mohammed remarked. “What is even bitterer is the state of waiting to face the truth.” \nLess than a year before he died, in December 2014, Bahaa wrote a Facebook post titled “ The 10 commandments of a martyr ”. In it, he acknowledged that home demolition was a likely consequence of “martyrdom”, and noted: “Do not make me a number you will remember today and forget tomorrow.” \n\nThe title of “martyr”, however, is not the part Mohammed wants to remember about his son. “Like any Palestinian young man, [Bahaa] used to dream of freedom” Bahaa was an avid reader, a Scout leader, and a youth support worker. Two years ago, he gathered thousands of people together to create a human chain around the Old City; each person carried a book, all of which were later gathered for a library. It was a message to the Israelis, his father said: “We are not who you say we are. We are not terrorists. We are educated people. We are well-read people.” \n\nMohammed cleared his throat and looked out across the horizon, as the afternoon sun began to sink lower in the darkening sky. \n\n”Like any Palestinian young man, [Bahaa] used to dream of freedom,” Mohammed said quietly. “He had a lot of hopes and dreams, and he hoped for freedom, but the reality of the occupation … led him to try to find a way to resist, and this was the path he chose.” “ Bahaa ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T10:34:56.126+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
