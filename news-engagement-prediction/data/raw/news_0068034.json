And once again, the nation’s most rigorous, independent study has rated Verizon the #1 network in the U.S. According to RootMetrics ® new National RootScore ® Report, released today, Verizon swept all six network categories for all of 2016, including reliability, data, speed, call, text and overall performance – an industry first since testing began. \nAccording to the RootMetrics Second-Half 2016 US Mobile Network Performance special report, “ Based on our testing, Verizon is the undisputed leader in terms of coverage and network reliability. Indeed, Verizon’s network reliability results were the strongest among all carriers at the metro, state, and national levels in the second half of 2016 .” The study is RootMetrics’ most recent, gathering input from the four national wireless companies over the exact same period of time. \n“These test results are absolutely overwhelming. Only Verizon’s network offers superior performance, unrivaled reliability and the best speeds for customers making it the best option for unlimited data plans ,” said Nicola Palmer, Verizon’s chief wireless network officer. “We are extending our lead in network performance in the top 125 Metro areas and in state and national network performance results.” \nVerizon has been able to pull ahead significantly in network performance thanks to consistent investment in reliability, innovation and the latest engineering technologies. Since 2000, the company has invested $122 billion, more than any competitor. Verizon’s 4G LTE network covers more than 2.4 million square miles and 314 million people, more than any other wireless company. Better network performance in 48 states \nThe RootMetrics Second-Half 2016 State Network Performance special report finds: “ Verizon’s performance in our state-level testing was exceptional across the board .” Verizon repeated its industry leadership from the first half of 2016 into the second half of the year, with wins or first place ties in 48 of 50 states in overall network performance. The two discount networks did not win or tie a single state, contributing to their total of zero wins in overall network performance since state RootScore Report studies began in the second half of 2013. Extending the lead in metro reports \nIn the second half of the year, Verizon won or tied 93 percent of the time in overall network performance – that’s 116 of 125 metro markets tested – further extending the lead over the other providers. \nVerizon was unbeaten in 93% of the 125 metro markets tested. \nAccording to the RootMetrics Second-Half 2016 Metro Network Performance special report of top 125 cities: “Verizon’s award total of 658 was easily the highest among all networks, and the carrier’s increase of 95 awards compared to first-half 2016 testing was the largest gain of any network .” (Verizon’s 658 awards, outright or tied, is out of a total possible 750 awards in the six testing categories for the 125 Metro areas.) \nGet the latest on Verizon Unlimited on the network you deserve.
