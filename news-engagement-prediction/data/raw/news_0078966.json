Kim Mulkey sounds off on recent national scrutiny about #Baylor and female student safety on campus after Lady Bears' win. pic.twitter.com/Jy8YUDhtBW — John Elizondo (@JohnElizondo25) February 25, 2017 \nMulkey subsequently called Baylor the “best damn school in America” and insisted “the problems we have at Baylor are no different than the problems at any other school in America.” \nSimply put, she’s unforgivably wrong on both points because A) Baylor is not the “best damn school in America” by any way such things are measured, and B) literally no other school in America has problems that compare to Baylor’s problems. \nWhat an embarrassing thing for her to say. \nThe truth about Baylor is that it’s being sued for running a football program that had players who allegedly committed 52 sexual assaults in a four-year span under former coach Art Briles. And the reason he’s former coach Art Briles is because this scandal cost him his job last year and also led to the firing or resignation of Baylor president Ken Starr, athletic director Ian McCaw, Title IX coordinator Patty Crawford and multiple others. So unless people with those titles have all been fired or forced to resign at every other school in America in the past year -- s poiler alert: they haven’t! -- suggesting Baylor’s problems are just like anybody else’s problems is at best a gross minimization of the seriousness of the issue. At worst, it’s a disgusting lie rooted in denial. \nWhich is the most disappointing thing about Mulkey’s remarks. \nThe hope was that the people who were responsible for creating a culture at Baylor where female students were placed in danger and then quieted or ignored were all removed from campus, and that the coaches and administrators who remained learned lessons from their mistakes. But what Mulkey said Saturday, completely unprompted, suggests that’s not the case at all. \nShe said she’s “tired of hearing it” and that people should “move on [and] find another story to write.” That’s an unbelievable public statement that’s ignorant to the fact that what the rest of us are tired of is hearing men and women in positions of power at Baylor telling everybody to move on and stop worrying about all of the sexual assaults that allegedly involved Baylor student-athletes. \nBecause guess what? \nThat’s exactly the kind of dismissive attitude that got Baylor in this position. \nI wonder why Kim Mulkey doesn’t realize it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T09:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:37:32.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
