There are hostel beds available for most rough sleepers in the city and services are available for those sleeping rough with help routinely offered to them. We aim to use this grant funding to encourage more people, especially those not yet accustomed to life on the streets, to accept the help and turn their lives around.\"\n– Councillor Warwick Payne, cabinet member for Housing & Adult Care Last updated Thu 23 Feb 2017 Southampton Hampshire & Isle of Wight", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:00:42.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
