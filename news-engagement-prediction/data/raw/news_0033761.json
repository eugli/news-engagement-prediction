Their children are more likely to die as infants. And their health, education and employment outcomes are worse than non-Indigenous people. \nAustralia has promised to close this gap on health, education and employment. But a new report card finds we are failing on six out of seven key measures . \nThis article includes interactive enhancements which are not supported on this platform. \nFor the full interactive experience in this article, you will need a modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.

Not on track: Life expectancy Target: To close the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians within a generation (by 2031). Progress: Indigenous Australians die about 10 years younger than non Indigenous Australians, and that hasn't changed significantly. With increasing life expectancy in the non-Indigenous population, to close the gap \"Indigenous life expectancy would need to increase by 16 years and 21 years for females and males respectively\". That means gains of at least 0.6 years per annum, but in the five years to 2012 there was only a gain of 0.8 years for men and 0.1 for women — a fraction of what is needed. The mortality rate (the number of deaths per 100,000 people in a year) for Aboriginal people is 1.7 times that of the Australian population, and that hasn't changed since 1998. Not on track: Child mortality Target: To halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five within a decade (by 2018). Progress: There has been no significant decline in child mortality rates since 2008 , and child mortality rates actually increased slightly from 2014 to 2015. In 2015, there were 124 Indigenous child deaths. This was four deaths outside the range of the target and an increase of six deaths since 2014. Between 2011 and 2014 Indigenous children aged 0-4 were more than twice as likely to die than non-Indigenous children. Not on track: Employment Target : Halve the gap in employment by 2018. Progress : The Indigenous employment rate has fallen since 2008, as has the non-Indigenous employment rate. The gap in 2014-15 was 24.2 percentage points, up from 21.2 percentage points in 2008. Indigenous employment rates vary according to geography, with only 35.1 per cent of all Indigenous people of workforce age in very remote areas employed, compared with 57.5 of those in major cities. NSW was the only state to see an improvement since 2008 (47.3 per cent employed vs 53.1 per cent in 2014-15). Indigenous women have made significant progress in employment since the 1990s but still lag behind male employment rates. Not on track: Reading & writing Target: Halve the gap in reading and numeracy for Indigenous students by 2018. Progress: While some improvements are being made, of the eight areas measured (reading and numeracy for Years 3, 5, 7 and 9), only year 9 numeracy is on track . Indigenous 15-year-olds are on average about two-and-a-third years behind non-Indigenous 15-year-olds in reading and maths. Results for Indigenous students are worse in more remote areas. The report says that the numbers required to halve the gap are still within reach. Not on track: School attendance Target: Close the gap in school attendance by the end of 2018. Progress: There has been no real change in the Indigenous school attendance rate between 2014 and 2016. Indigenous attendance rates actually fell by 1.6 percentage points in the Northern Territory. Nationally, the attendance rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in 2016 was 83.4 per cent compared to 93.1 per cent for their non-Indigenous counterparts. Indigenous students have higher attendance rates in inner regional areas (87 per cent) compared to very remote areas (66 per cent). Not on track: Early education Target : 95 per cent of all Indigenous four-year-olds enrolled in early childhood education by 2025. Progress : In 2015, 87 per cent of Indigenous children were enrolled in early childhood education in the year before starting school, compared with 98 per cent of non-Indigenous children. The original target – to give all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities access to early childhood education – expired unmet in 2013. The revised target focuses on Indigenous children nationally, not just remote communities. It uses 2015 as a baseline. New data to measure the progress against this target will be available for next year’s report. On track: Year 12 attainment Goal: Halve the gap in Year 12 attainment by 2020. Progress: About 62 per cent of Indigenous students finished year 12 or equivalent in 2014-15, compared to 86 per cent of non-Indigenous Australians. All states have seen increases in the percentage of Indigenous students finishing year 12, and the report says this goal is on track for 2020 . The greatest progress is being made in 'outer regional' areas, where the proportion of Indigenous students finishing year 12 climbed from 43 per cent to 66 per cent. In 'very remote' areas, 42 per cent of Indigenous students are finishing year 12, up from 24 per cent. The report says there is a close association between low levels of education and incarceration for Indigenous Australians. \nCredits: Reporting by Dan Conifer and Tim Leslie ; illustrations by Lucy Fahey", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:57:55.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
