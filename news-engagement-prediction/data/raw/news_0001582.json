left us all a little underwhelmed but there was still a day of fevered activity on Tuesday as clubs scrambled to get what players were left on the shelf.\nThere were also several deals that didn't happen. Here Sportsmail looks at why.\nSALOMON RONDON\nWest Brom to Tianjin Quanjin\nThe Chinese had tried and failed for Islam Slimani at Leicester and switched targets to Rondon last week. A first proposal of around £25m was rebuffed but Tianjin then came back with £32million on Monday which was again dismissed by Albion's board. Though Rondon is understood to be interested in the high wages on offer he knows Tony Pulis values him highly and Albion backed their manager saying he was not for sale at any price. Pulis said: 'Salomon stays with us and thank God for that.'\nChinese Super League side Tianjin Quanjin were interested in Salomon Rondon\nMOUSSA DEMBELE\nCeltic to Chelsea\nWest Ham had set the tone for Dembele after saying they would offer £20m for him early in the window only for Celtic to say not for sale. Chelsea then came in late and discussed a price. Celtic didn't want to sell but said Dembele was valued at £40m and the player was happy. With the high valuation sticking, Chelsea stopped short of bidding but will consider going back in the summer though they will face greater competition.\nIt was no secret that Chelsea were interested in Celtic striker Moussa Dembele\nASMIR BEGOVIC\nChelsea to Bournemouth\nChelsea wanted a replacement before allowing Begovic to leave and focused on Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon. Chelsea made two bids of £2.5m and £4m and had both rejected. Celtic said not for sale but were looking for £6m plus. Gordon contemplated pushing to leave but has been promised a pay rise. Chelsea considered David Stockdale and Salvatore Sirigu but the time spent on Gordon cost Begovic his move - at least until the summer.\nChelsea goalkeeper Asmir Begovic was interested in leaving for first-team football\nCeltic goalkeeper Craig Gordon was on Chelsea's radar but the shot-stopper stayed put\nASHLEY FLETCHER\nWest Ham to Leeds United\nFletcher was lined up for a loan to Leeds early in the window. West Ham's intention at that stage was to add two strikers. They tried for Jermain Defoe and Chelsea's Michy Batshuayai but neither Sunderland nor Chelsea would allow them out. Recruitment director Tony Henry pushed for Brentford's Scott Hogan and bids were made but Slaven Bilic ultimately opted to pull out which meant Fletcher had to stay as cover along with Jonathan Calleri.\nAshley Fletcher was lined up to join Leeds United on loan during the January window\nASHLEY YOUNG\nManchester United to Watford\nThe 31-year-old was wanted by several Premier League sides with West Ham, Watford, West Brom, Swansea and Crystal Palace all considering the merits of the former England international. Even though he has been given limited game time, Young is a popular figure at United. Frustrated though, he asked Jose Mourinho if he could leave on loan yet United wanted a fee and his £100,000 a week-plus wages paid in full which cooled interest. United then rebuffed loan requests on the final day.\nManchester United's Ashley Young was wanted by several sides, including Watford\nANDROS TOWNSEND\nCrystal Palace to Newcastle United\nRafa Benitez endured a window of frustration after his club were rebuffed in a bid for Everton's James McCarthy and stopped short of paying the asking price for Andros Townsend. Palace wanted a £2million loan fee and a guaranteed £13m in the summer and it's understood Newcastle wanted the £2m to be knocked off the final asking price. Townsend was also keen to keep his options open in the summer to stay in the top flight.\nCrystal Palace's Andros Townsend was wanted by Rafa Benitez's Newcastle United\nSERDAR TASCI\nSpartak Moscow to Southampton\nThe 29-year-old Germany international was due to fly to Southampton at the weekend for what seemed a straightforward loan move, even though Spartak were pushing for a permanent deal. He failed to turn up for his first scheduled flight but came over on Monday for talks with a pre-arranged deal set. However, he failed to agree terms as he looked for around £3m in wages tax free. Crystal Palace moved to hijack the deal but balked at his demands also.\nSerdar Tasci of Spartak Moscow was supposed to be signing for Southampton\nODION IGHALO\nWatford to West Bromwich Albion\nIghalo had been discussed as part of a swap deal involving Saido Berahino last summer and when Stoke bid for Berahino, Watford were sounded out to check if a deal could be revived to increase the bidding. Berahino didn't want to go to Watford though so only a deal for Ighalo was left. Albion considered offering £12m but Watford's asking price was too high and they dismissed a loan. Crystal Palace tried too before Ighalo was sold to Changchong Yatai.\nWatford striker Odion Ighalo was wanted by West Brom but instead has went to China", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/DailyMailManUnited"], "published": "2017-02-01T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:18:52.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
