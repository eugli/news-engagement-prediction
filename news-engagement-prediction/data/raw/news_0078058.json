ADVERTISEMENT \nFr. Gregorio Uanan, judicial vicar of the Diocese of Ilagan, said Nacua suffered a stroke in 2015 and had to be hospitalized. \nAlthough the prelate has been steadily recovering since then, the stroke has significantly affected his mobility. \n“We have a huge diocese and it’s hard for him already so he thought that it would be best for him to just retire,” Uanan said on the CBCP news website. \nNacua, a Capuchin missionary, was formally installed as bishop of the diocese in September 2008 and was the first Capuchin missionary to be named to the position. \nHis resignation at 72 means that he is three years younger than the age at which bishops are required by canon law to submit their resignation to the Pope. \nBorn on January 5, 1945 in Mankayan, Benguet, Nacua was ordained a Capuchin priest on June 26, 1971. \nFor nine years, he served the Diocese of Ilagan which has more 1.2 million Catholics. \nAside from Ilagan, six other dioceses in the country have no bishops – these are the dioceses of Daet, Bayombong, Iba, Isabela, Kabankalan, and Mati.
