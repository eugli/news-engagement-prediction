We will use all resources to pursue them,” Noor Rashid told a press conference, the first by the police since the killing. Official story: Noor Rashid speaking to the media during the press conference at Bukit Aman. \nOn the possibility that the murder was politically motivated, Noor Rashid said the police were not interested in any political angle. \n“What we are interested in is why they committed such a crime in our country. \n“Any political angle can be put aside as it is not our job to worry about political matters. \n“We want to get at the truth and bring the perpetrators to justice,” he said. \nHe said police were also looking for North Korean citizen Ri Ji-u, 30, also known as James, along with two others to help in investigations. \nOf those arrested, Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, 28, arrived from Hanoi on Feb 4 while Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, a spa masseuse, entered the country via Batam on Feb 2. \nNorth Korean Ri Jong-chol, 47, was arrested on Friday and entered Malaysia on Aug 6 last year. \n“We are in the process of identifying the two others sought to assist in the investigations,” said Noor Rashid. \n“We hope anyone with information can come forward,” he said. \nOn Jong-nam’s post-mortem, Noor Rashid said that it was conducted on Feb 15 at Hospital Kuala Lumpur. \n“The cause of death is still unknown. We are waiting for the toxicology and pathological test results. I think in a few days, we will get the toxicology result. \n“The case will be referred to the deputy public prosecutor for fur­ther instructions and investi­ga­tion,” he said. \nPriority is given to close family members or next of kin to claim the body and they have been given two weeks to do so, added Noor Rashid. \n“It is very important for close family members of the deceased to come forward to assist us in the process of identification, which is based on our legal procedures and Malaysian law. \n“However, as of today, we have not met the next of kin. We are trying very hard to get the next of kin to assist us,” he said. \nIn the event that the family does not show up, Noor Rashid said police will look at further options. \nRelated stories:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:13:15.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
