Photo: Michael Kovac/Getty Images Despite all the backlash Bill Maher received for booking infamous troll Milo Yiannopoulous for an interview on Real Time last week , Maher now says the decision was worth it. In the days since the interview, Yiannopoulous’s resurfaced comments in which he appeared to condone child sexual abuse led to Simon & Schuster pulling the plug on his controversial book ; yesterday, he resigned from his editor post at Breitbart News . And if you ask Maher, which the New York Times did Tuesday night, he’s the one to thank for bringing down Yiannopoulous: “As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant. You’re welcome.” However, Maher readily admits it wasn’t his intention to incite a witch hunt — “I’m somebody who, many times, people have tried to make go away” — because he still doesn’t view Yiannopoulous as a legitimate threat. “To see him as this monster is a little crazy. You know what he is?” Maher says. “He’s the little impish, bratty kid brother. And the liberals are his older teenager sisters who are having a sleepover and he puts a spider in their sleeping bag so he can watch them scream.”\nMaher also defended his softball questions and lack of pushback against Yiannopoulous’s hate speech during the interview thusly: “It’s not my job to hold him accountable to everything he’s ever said or done. I had eight minutes with him, on the show itself. Sorry I don’t have time to go over everything everybody else would want to do.” And for anyone hoping Maher is done giving the alt-right a mouthpiece on Real Time , dream on: \n\n“I like people who push the limits. I like people who are not afraid to take the slings and arrows, because they’re going to explore what’s on the edge. Now, is this guy over the edge? Yes. I mean, he’s a little cuckoo. But I would rather err on that side than on the side where everybody else is.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:11:28.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
