The   is still under way and we have been very transparent. The ambassador cannot make baseless accusations against us. \n\"It is nothing short of shocking. This is not the action befitting a diplomat,\" Liow, who is also Transport Minister, told reporters after chairing a presidential council meeting at Wisma MCA on Tuesday. \nOn Monday after being summoned by Wisma Putra, ambassador Kang Chol denounced the Malaysian police investigation into the murder of Jong-nam, the exiled half-brother of the country’s ruler Kim Jong-un. \nNorth Korea strongly criticised Malaysia’s handling of the investigation and alleged that Malaysia had been colluding with Pyongyang’s enemies. \nWisma Putra defended the measures taken by the police and others involved in the probe, and said the allegations by Kang Chol were “baseless”. \nJong-nam, 45, was killed by two women who splashed his face with a chemical at the KLIA2 departure hall at about 9am on Feb 13 as he was about to leave for Macau. \nFour people have so far been arrested in the ensuing investigation. \nLast Wednesday, the first suspect, who holds a Vietnamese passport bearing the name Doan Thi Huong, was arrested at KLIA2 as she was preparing to board a flight to Vietnam. \nIndonesian Siti Aisyah was arrested at a hotel in Ampang at 2am the next day. \nPolice said she was identified based on CCTV footage at the airport and was alone at the time of arrest. \nSiti Aisyah’s boyfriend was also picked up by police to assist with investigations. \nThe fourth suspect arrested over the assassination has been identified as North Korean Ri Jong-chol, from Pyongyang. \nThe 47-year-old man, who has expertise in chemistry, was detained after police raided a condominium in Jalan Kuchai Lama last Friday. \nOn Sunday, police said they were searching for four more North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of Jong-nam’s death.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:54:02.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
