The couple share a kiss in the black and white shot, with Bowie wearing a hat and Iman donning a white wrap around her head. \n“My forever Valentine,” she captioned the image, adding the hasthags # # ValentinesDay. \nIman has honored her love on social media many times in the year since his passing, including on what would have been the music icon’s birthday and the couple’s 24th wedding anniversary . \nBowie and Iman met in October of 1990, and “they were inseparable” ever since, the couple’s friend, hairstylist Teddy Antolin, told PEOPLE in January . \n“They really knew each other because they had come up and traveled in the same circles. They were great together,” Antolin added at the time. “She was a real force and he needed a woman by his side to keep him focused.” \nRELATED VIDEO: Iman Honors Late Husband David Bowie on Their 24th Anniversary \nThe model and the rocker married in Tuscany, Italy, after two years together. \n“The wedding was stunning,” Antolin reminisced. “It was all outside of Florence in an old villa that had been transformed into a luxury hotel.” \nThen, in summer 2000, Bowie and Iman welcomed their daughter together, Alexandria “Lexi” Zahra Jones. \nBowie was 69 when he died of cancer in January 2016. \nHis widow has remained largely out of the public eye since her great love’s death. In February, she was photographed for the first time since the the news of the icon’s death broke when she stepped out in New York City to walk the dog they raised together; then, just days later, she took to social media to express her “love & gratitude” for the outpouring of support she received. \nIn April, just three months after losing her husband, Iman announced on Instagram her mother Maryan Baadi had also died.
