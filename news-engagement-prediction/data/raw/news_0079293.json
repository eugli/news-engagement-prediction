That’s not an exaggeration, as he was very much a force to be reckoned with. It made its debut on Adult Swim and won over scores of new anime fans with its silliness, relatable hero, creepy villains, and hilarious antics. \nIt’s absolutely worth watching if you haven’t already, though its first season definitely wasn’t long enough to sate our hunger for all things One Punch . That’s why it’s such good news that a second season is possibly on its way. \nIt seems rumors are swirling around that the series is set to return for a second season this year, and the episodes that will comprise the season are already supposedly in production. As far as a concrete date goes, that’s up for debate. The second season of the show could very well make its worldwide debut later in July this year, which is actually the second anniversary of One Punch Man’s original debut. That could change at any moment, however, and it could end up being sooner or later since there hasn’t been any official confirmation. \nIf you’re interested in seeing what happens to Saitama in the next season ahead of time, however, you can pick up the manga and jump in to see what you’re missing without skipping a beat. Some spoilery predictions include the idea that Saitama will have some sort of vulnerability going forward and he may have to fight against Lord Boros. \nOne thing’s for sure: Hopefully, Saitama finally earns some of the respect that’s been sorely missing from his treatment from the Hero Association he belongs to, and maybe we’ll see less of Genos this time around and more of the titular One Punch Man .
