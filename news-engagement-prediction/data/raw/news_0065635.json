It’s just so embarrassing. We buy our food at Tesco and Sainsbury’s every week and we have never, ever been stopped before.” \nSt Laurence's Larder is based at the Christ Church in Brondesbury \nMr Chamberlain revealed the charity was not able to give everyone who turned up on Friday enough food for the weekend because of the Tesco incident. \n“I could understand if there was a shortage of fresh fruit or veg but surely they don’t need to ration tuna,” he added. \n“It’s not like we had taken every last tin either, we hadn’t even taken half of them.” Read more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:25:06.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
