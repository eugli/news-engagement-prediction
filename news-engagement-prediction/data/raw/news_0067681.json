Image copyright Reuters Image caption UPS wants its drivers to be able to send small packages by drone while they deliver larger parcels by road \n\"Drivers are the face of our company and that won't change,\" said Mark Wallace, the firm's senior vice-president of global engineering. \n\"What's exciting is the potential for drones to aid drivers at various points along their routes. Imagine a triangular delivery route where the stops are kilometres apart. \n\"Sending a drone from a package car to make just one of those deliveries can reduce costly kilometres driven.\" \nThe Horsefly octacopter involved was made by Ohio-based Workhorse Group. \nThe initial test went well, with the aircraft launching from a platform built into the truck's slide-open roof. \nBut a second attempt was more problematic. \nThe drone tipped over when it tried to take off, rocked back and was then nearly crushed when the truck's roof began to close over the launch pad where the machine was still sitting. \n\"For the photographers we tried to do a quick non-traditional delivery and something went wrong,\" Stephen Burns, chief executive of Workhorse, told the news site Techcrunch. \n\"We probably shouldn't have tried to do something weird like that with everyone watching.\" \nMr Burns added that the problem may have been caused by interference from TV cameras filming the trial. Techcrunch has posted footage of the incident on its site .
