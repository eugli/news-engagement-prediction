Key points: MPs sign symbolic motion calling for Mr Trump not to be given the honour of speaking in Parliament Unlikely Mr Trump will be given the honour as a result of speaker's intervention Address by a foreign leader \"not an automatic right\", speaker says \nPrime Minister Theresa May has defended the decision to offer a state visit to Mr Trump, but more than 150 MPs have signed a symbolic motion calling for the President not to be given the honour of speaking in Parliament. \nSpeaker John Bercow's unusual public intervention makes it unlikely Mr Trump will be given the honour during his trip later this year. \nThis is because he is one of the parliamentary officials who would have to agree on inviting a foreign dignitary to address members in the House of Commons and peers, who sit in the House of Lords. \nMr Bercow said the other \"key holders\" in the decision were the Speaker of the House of Lords, Lord Fowler, and the Lord Great Chamberlain, a hereditary peer in charge of certain parts of the Palace of Westminster, according to the BBC. \n\"An address by a foreign leader to both houses of Parliament is not an automatic right; it is an earned honour,\" Mr Bercow said. \nAsked by an opposition Labour MP about the possibility of a parliamentary address, Mr Bercow said he shared the concerns. \n\"As far as this place (Parliament) is concerned, I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism, and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations,\" Mr Bercow said, earning a round of applause. \nHe said he would have been against extending the invitation even before Mr Trump's temporary ban on citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations entering the US . \nMr Trump's executive order prompted worldwide protests, including by thousands of demonstrators in London. External Link: @realDonaldTrump: \"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" Britons critical of May's apparent rush to get close to Trump \nMr Bercow's comments were unusual because speakers in the British Parliament are expected to remain above the partisan fray. \nWorld leaders given the honour of making a speech to both houses include Nelson Mandela and Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama. \nMr Trump is due to visit Britain later this year as the guest of Queen Elizabeth II. \nThe invitation was announced by Ms May when she visited Mr Trump in Washington last month. \nBut some Britons are critical of the Government's apparent rush to get close to the new US President. \nAn online petition opposing Mr Trump's state visit has more than 1.8 million signatures and will be debated by lawmakers on February 20, though they will not hold a binding vote on it. \nMs May's office said the dates and itinerary for the state visit have not yet been finalised. \nAP/Reuters First posted February 07, 2017 10:45:33 The Trump presidency", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:42:22.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
