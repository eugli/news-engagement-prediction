He added, “Bansal’s severance pay being ‘hush money’is deeply disturbing.” \nBansal, it was reported, was given Rs 17 crore as severance, and grapevine has it that he knew company secrets, and the money to paid to keep his tightlipped. \nMurthy, who started Infosys in 1981, along with six others, had stepped down from the company’s board in 2014, as Vishal Sikka took over as the new CEO. A tug-of-war between the founders and the management has engulfed the “once high on corporate governance” IT bellwether in a series of allegations and fight back. \nSeshasayee defends the Infosys’ board’s stand: “I don’t think there is any battle. There is no conflict of interest. There is only convergence of interest.” Read more Why Narayana Murthy does not want to hang up his boots \nMurthy, too, early in the day had clarifies that there is “no battle” between the founders and the Infosys board. However, he did mention that he did point out what was needed. \nHe also defended Sikka’s salary, by disclosing that since the time the former SAP employee took over the reins at Infosys, his fixed component has gone down to $4 million from $5.08 million. “Compensation is tied to very high levels of target achievements,” said Seshasayee. \nTo be fair, Infosys’ share price, since Sikka became the CEO went up by 54% in August 2016. Even though the prices are down, still Infosys is trading 22% above what Sikka had inherited from Murthy. \nWhile Seshasayee decided to clear the air, he did say that the “differences shouldn’t have come out in the public”, signalling the dent it may have caused to the company’s image.

He clarified that only 8% of the travel was by jets. He also said that Bansal was given only Rs 5 crore, instead of the agreed Rs 17 crore. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:22.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
