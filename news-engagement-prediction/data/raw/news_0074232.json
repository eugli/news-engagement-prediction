Photo: Getty Images Sorry, Abraham Zapruder: We’ve got a new piece of footage to pore over again and again. In the final moments of Sunday night’s Oscars telecast, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway mistakenly announced La La Land as the Best Picture winner, only for that film’s acceptance speeches to be interrupted by the news that Moonlight had actually won instead .\n\nHow did this happen? Let’s turn to our culture’s one infallible record: GIFs.\n\nFirst, Beatty opens the envelope. He’s initially befuddled by what he sees.\n\nThen he vamps for a bit, and checks to see if there’s a second piece of paper inside.\n\nThe reason for his confusion? As eagle-eyed viewers later confirm , he’s holding the envelope for Best Actress.\n\nMore vamping.\n\nBeatty hands the envelope to Dunaway. Seeing La La Land on the card, she confidently announces the musical as the Best Picture winner. As the camera cuts away, a microphone picks up Beatty telling her , “But it says Emma Stone.”\n\nAs the La La Land gang begins to accept the award, a man in a headset arrives on stage with the correct envelope.\n\nA moment of uncertainty as team La La Land tries to figure out what’s going on.\n\nEmma Stone: “Oh my God.”\n\nThen La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz interrupts to set the record straight: Moonlight is the real winner.\n\n“This is not a joke.”\n\nThe man in the headset hands the correct envelope to Horowitz, who shows it to the audience.\n\nProof!\nTeam Moonlight is elated.\n\nAs the La La Land crowd sheepishly congratulates the Moonlight people, Jimmy Kimmel arrives to rib Beatty about the mistake.\n\nKnowing that he’ll probably never live this down, Beatty explains that his envelope had Emma Stone’s name in it.\n\nBeatty realizes he’s now a part of Oscar history. On the bright side, this will probably make people forget Rules Don’t Apply .\n\nTags: vulture homepage lede gifs movies oscars 2017 la la land warren beatty moonlight More The Oscars’ Best Picture Debacle: A GIF Breakdown   23 mins ago A GIF Breakdown of the Oscars’ Last-Minute Best Picture Switcharoo A step-by-step breakdown to the Oscar Shocker.\n2:11 a.m. Moonlight ’s Barry Jenkins: I Don’t Know Why That Best Picture Snafu Happened The Academy has not yet given him an explanation of the Best Picture mix up.\n2:08 a.m. WATCH: Two Oscar Winners Missed the Ceremony Because of Trump’s Travel Ban Iranian director Asghar Farhadi and Syrian cinematographer Khaled Khateeb did not attend.\n1:59 a.m. Emma Stone Says Her Best Actress Envelope Not to Blame for Best Picture Shocker “I don’t mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was — I had that card.”\n1:49 a.m. WATCH: The Oscars Got Political Okay, it was mostly Jimmy Kimmel.\n1:41 a.m. The Moonlight Mix-Up, Plus Other Highs, Lows, and Whoas of the 2017 Oscars You’ll always remember where you were when Faye Dunaway said “La La Land.”\n1:09 a.m. Amazon and Netflix Just Won the First of What’s Sure to Be Many Oscars Both streaming services picked up wins Sunday night.\n1:06 a.m. Celebrities Reactions to Moonlight ’s Surprise Best Picture Oscars Win Moonlight was declared the Best Picture winner only after favorite La La Land was first announced.\n12:35 a.m. Moonlight  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:46:59.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
