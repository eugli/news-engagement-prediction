The media is truly trying to erase [her] legacy.” \nHicks’ comments mirror those of quite a few Jackson Jackson fans who feel that a long-rumored attempt to wipe Jackson out of music history altogether following her Super Bowl performance is very real. \nFollowing her game day set in 2003, Janet Jackson was blacklisted by several media-related organizations which effectively caused her music, her videos, and even her name to cease being promoted on or by way of radio stations, television screens and of course, the occasional award show performance. \nThat same week, Jackson had been named as a presenter at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, where it was expected that she would also give a public apology for her actions at the Super Bowl. Janet rightly rescinded the request, since she never expected to be exposed in such a way in the first place, whereas Timberlake relented to the show’s demands and was treated as a media darling, and still is to this very day. \nJackson, meanwhile, was rarely seen or heard from publicly after the matter, save for her fans on the Rock Witchu and Number Ones: Up Close and Personal tours in 2008 and 2011; the first of which was truncated due to personal illness and the 2009 economic crisis, and the latter being funded by Jackson herself (it also stands to chance that Jackson had to use her own money due to being without a label after the sales failure of her Discipline album from 2008). \nMost believed the proverbially-tight strings of the Janet media ban had finally been loosened after 2009, when her older brother Michael died and she accepted a request to perform a tribute to him at that year’s MTV Video Music Awards. The move was huge from both sides: from MTV, the network that hosted the now-infamous Super Bowl show that focused on Jackson’s participation, and Janet herself, who had not only seemed to accept the token of forgiveness, but did so less than three months after she buried Michael.

Cole), and it was clear to everyone that the break in public attention was not just unnecessary, but still not a factor of her remaining successful. \nAnd I suppose that’s where things take a bit of a petty turn, because if we really want to dig deep and get a little real about her actual importance, let’s not forget that even when she’s not actively working on music, the name Janet Jackson is still a major selling point in the world of media. \nAnother case in point: twice this year, the elusive artist literally did nothing but exist in the world and she still managed to see her name trend for; to simplify the events, taking a breezy stroll in London, and for giving birth to her son, Eissa. \nNo new music, no music videos, nothing that women of all ages don’t do all around the world every single day, but there she was anyway — trending topic and still on our minds, Janet Jackson. \nIn other words, the media surely has no qualms in bringing up her name whenever it seems to benefit them, so why not do so when it’s actually necessary and it literally makes sense for them to do so, like on a best-of list regarding the most seminal music makers in the history of everything? \nWell, truth be told, there are probably quite a few different factors as to why that still is (and yes, race is, without a doubt, most likely one of the leading reasons), but if this is all just about that 9/16th of a second that she never wanted to happen in the first, perhaps we all need get a grip already. \nWith so many other music legends no longer with us, the last thing anyone should be purposely doing is ignoring another one over an accident. It’s beyond time, guys — give Janet Jackson the respect and mentions she rightfully deserves. \n“She’ll most likely have to work against the damage done by that 9/16th of a second for the rest of her career, a tiny momentary blip that contains projections of some of the ugliest facets of America. And for this, we owe Janet Jackson a huge apology.” \n[Featured Image by Bryan Bedder/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:04:33.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
