Across the country, temperatures range from -32 C to 2 C – and snow is still projected in the upcoming weeks. \nREAD MORE: Here’s how women’s heart attack symptoms differ from men’s \n“With global climate change, major snowstorms may become more frequent and severe. Understanding trends in hospitalizations related to snowfall will help us develop ways to protect public health during harsh winter conditions,” Jennifer Bob, the study’s lead author, said. \nThe research is based on data from over 433,000 adults hospitalized in the four largest hospitals in Boston from November to April over the course of five years from 2010 to 2015. \nThe team zeroed in on heart disease and cold weather-related conditions, such as frostbite and falls. \nTurns out, heart disease admissions were highest on days of moderate snowfall – about 12 to 25 centimetres. \nREAD MORE: Have high pain tolerance? Don’t ignore these signs of a ‘silent’ heart attack \nThe most admissions to hospital for falls came, on average, six days following a moderate snowfall. These incidents increased by 18 per cent on day six compared to days without any snow. \nFinally, across the board, cold weather-related admissions increased by 3.7 per cent on high snowfall days where there was more than 25 centimetres of snow. \nSo why the two-day delay? The scientists guess it’s because snowstorms keep people indoors and away from potential hazards. There could also be a delay – people may not want to head to hospital in the middle of a whiteout. \nREAD MORE: What floor you live on may determine cardiac arrest survival, Canadian study suggests \nSnow shovelling could also be a factor. When the snow settles, that’s typically when people head outdoors to clear their driveways. \nThe medical community always pointed to a link between the cold season and an increase in heart attacks, but researchers say that people in warmer locations aren’t any less vulnerable. \nThey suggest that other factors are at play, too: shorter days, falling out of good habits and daily exercise all wreak havoc with our health and immune systems. \nHeart doctors at Los Angeles’ Good Samaritan Hospital looked into why heart risk is as much a factor in hot climates like Florida as in chillier regions like Massachusetts. \nREAD MORE: Male heart attack patients receive faster care than women, Canadian study suggests \nTheir research found that people are 26 to 36 per cent more likely to die from a heart attack, heart failure, or other heart diseases in the winter compared to the summer. \nThe dip in temperatures makes blood vessels constrict, driving up your blood pressure. Your heart is forced to work overtime as your blood’s gateways narrow, decreasing blood flow. \nAnother “interesting phenomena” about winter is that the body’s blood itself thickens, making it more likely to clot when exposed to the cold. \nWinter is also notorious for the flu season as influenzas and other bugs make their rounds through the population. \nRead the full Harvard study published this week in the American Journal of Epidemiology . \n— With files from Allison Vuchnich, Global News \ncarmen.chai@globalnews.ca ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:12:23.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
