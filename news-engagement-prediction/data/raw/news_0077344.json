for Metro.co.uk Monday 27 Feb 2017 1:12 pm \nICYMI, last night was the night for award ceremonies. \nThere was something going on over in the states but there was only one ceremony that anyone actually cared about. 7 cool foodies share their favourite places to eat pancakes in London \nAnd that, of course, was the fifth British Kebab Awards. (It was actually trending above the Oscars in this country so, technically true). \nHosted by BBC 1 presenters Scott Mills and Chris Stark, it brought the great and the good of the shish and doner world together – along with a load of rowdy journos – to celebrate one of the world’s greatest culinary inventions. \nIt has to be said, our team was absolutely buzzing to be there. The glamour! The excitement! The food! \nThe awards were founded back in 2012 by Ibrahim Dogus, as a way of raising standards in the industry. \nIbrahim, who owns a restaurant himself, claims that kebabs are ‘the most popular dish in the country’– hence the rapid growth and success of his annual star-studded meat extravaganza. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nHis favourite kind of kebab is a lamb neck shish. \n‘I love real food – grilled on charcoal. I love doner kebab too but lamb shish is my favourite.’ And apparently, that’s his buddy Sadiq Kahn’s favourite too. \nSo how do the awards get dished out? \nIt’s all about points. Each hygiene star a business has won from the Food standard Agency rating is worth 50 points. If you’re nominated by your local politician, that’s another load of points. The kebaberies (is that a word?) with the most number of points get shortlisted – and then it’s up to the judges. \nHere were some of the evening’s highlights: THE GOOD Snapchat had a filter prepared especially for the occasion \nWhich is good because this was an important event. Thank God Snapchat have recognised this incredible event with a suitable filter #britishkebabawards @hardcastIe pic.twitter.com/HWyZlp7ebn \n— Metro Lifestyle (@MetroUK_Life) February 26, 2017 \nI turned up in an ill-fitting dress specifically to allow for a significant food baby later in the evening. After all, what would a food awards ceremony be without a feast of bacchanalian proportions? \nAnyway, we got there and got straight to work asking the questions the public needed answering. MPs love kebabs, fact \nTory MP for Bath, Ben Howlett, was as passionate and definite about his local kebab van as a man could be. \nHe also was completely correct in his assertion that chicken shish was the best kind of kebab. \nAnd then he went and ruined everything with his trash sauce choices. MP for Bath Ben Howlett @ben4bath being completely right on the fact that chicken shish is king of the kebab world #britishkebabawards pic.twitter.com/KR9NplbNAo \n— Metro Lifestyle (@MetroUK_Life) February 26, 2017 \nDon’t get me wrong, garlic sauce is nice but only a vanilla monster would choose it above chilli. At best, you want a combo going on. Failing that, you have to choose spice above cream. \nWhich, it turned out, is not an opinion shared by our readers – 47% of which have already voted for garlic sauce in our all-important poll: Chilli or yoghurt (read: garlic sauce) #britishkebabawards \n— Metro Lifestyle (@MetroUK_Life) February 26, 2017 Beer \nEach table was laden down with boxes of Bira – a new beer specifically designed to be drunk with kebabs. And by all accounts, it was delicious and very moreish (if the blokes behind us were anything to go by). \n— Metro Lifestyle (@MetroUK_Life) February 26, 2017 THE BAD #kebabawardssomale \n2017 is supposed to be the year of representation. Of multiculturalism. Of women. Of everyone. \nSo why then were literally no women on this year’s British Kebab Awards judging panel? \nIt wouldn’t even be as bad if you had to be a kebab kingpin to get chosen. But the judges were actually all just MPs and random businessmen. Were there no successful, female kebab fans out there who’d have been fit for the job? Outrageous. Clearly us women don't know anything about kebabs #kebabawards #judges pic.twitter.com/9d5AYFmLYH \n— Tanveer Mann (@tanny_mann) February 26, 2017 The lack of food \nLet’s be perfectly honest here. 99% of us who weren’t up for an award were there to eat a kebab. Who in their right mind would schlep into London on a rainy Sunday night unless there was a load of free meat up for scoffing? \nAs the awards ceremony got underway, we were treated to starters of cold meze. There was your usual hummus, tzatziki, tomato-based stews and bread but the crowd were obviously waiting with baited breath for the main course. \nAs video after video of kebabs was screened and restaurant after kitchen after kebab van was crowned victorious, we drooled into our empty plates. \nWe waited. \nAnd we waited. \nIn fact, there was a two hour period between the starter and main. And us journalists just couldn’t handle it. We considered drinking kebab sauce… We're genuinely considering downin' these sauces because we're about to die of starvation –<3 Table 29 #britishkebabawards @MetroUK_Life pic.twitter.com/0PAgQYB1sV \n— Tanveer Mann (@tanny_mann) February 26, 2017 I almost fell into a kebab-less coma… \n— Tanveer Mann (@tanny_mann) February 26, 2017 All that free booze on an empty stomach led to political correspondents threatening other publications I'm on 42 and I don't think we'd do v well but I reckon we could take the New Statesman table next to us easily \n— Marie Le Conte (@youngvulgarian) February 26, 2017 \nNever again will I leave my house without a bag of snackettes at the ready. THE BIZARRE In other words, technical disaster \nLike the Oscars, there was some confusion about who’d won what – primarily down to the fact that there are a lot of kebab houses that have similar names. \nAnd there were technical difficulties. Those mainly revolved around the fact that the dude supposedly in charge of video and sound had fallen asleep. \nNo word of a lie. APPARENTLY THE GUY WHO DOES THE MUSIC AND LISTINGS HAS FALLEN ASLEEP #britishkebabawards \n— Metro Lifestyle (@MetroUK_Life) February 26, 2017 \nThat meant that Scott and Chris had no idea who’d won what. \nAnd then when that was resolved, the microphones cut out. 'This is like a stress dream…This is the end of my career,' @scott_mills #britishkebabawards \n— Metro Lifestyle (@MetroUK_Life) February 26, 2017 \nIt was just incredible. \nNo one knew who had won and no one cared. \nBy the end of the evening, delirium from lack of food had set in to such a degree that really anything could have happened and the crowd would have gone along with it. \nBut hey, at least they didn’t actually hand any awards over to a completely different kebab house like some award ceremonies we know.
