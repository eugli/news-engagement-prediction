I can tell you, I don’t.” \nThe approved poison, Kaput Feral Hog Lure, contains warfarin, the same drug used to kill rats or prescribed by doctors, in smaller doses, to prevent blood clots. \nHunters and conservationists are afraid other animals may be exposed to toxin. \n“If a hog dies, what eats it? Coyotes, buzzards…” said Hansen. “We’re gonna affect possibly the whole ecosystem.” \nThe Kaput product website claims its low toxicity decreases that risk. \nThe company has also created a bait station to disseminate it that limits access to other wildlife. \nHansen remains skeptical. \n“I personally don’t think it’s going to work,” he said. \nCommissioner Miller told the State, in light of the product’s approval his department would no longer need $900,000 earmarked for feral hog control research. \n  Andrea Lucia facebook Follow Andrea joined CBS 11 and TXA 21 in September 2010, one day before a tornado swept through the area.
