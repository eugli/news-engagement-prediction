Melbourne's new suburbs: West of Melbourne: Quandong, Tarneit Plains, Kororoit, Mt Atkinson, Plumpton North-west of Melbourne : Lancefield Rd Sunbury, Sunbury South North of Melbourne: Lindum Vale, Beveridge North West, Beveridge Central, Donnybrook and Woodstock, Wollert, Northern Quarries South-east of Melbourne : Minta Farm, Pakenham East, McPherson \nThe State Government said the announcement was one of a suite of policies it would unveil this week to help people trying to get into the property market. \nThe blocks will go on the market between now and the end of next year in areas including Kalkallo, about 50 kilometres north of Melbourne's CBD, where a community of up to 40,000 will be established at Cloverton over the next 30 years. \nAll of the communities will be fully planned with access to town centres, schools and key infrastructure available when people move in, the State Government said. \n\"I think that's what's so important about a steady land supply going forward, but also quality planned environments for people who are going to live here,\" Planning Minister Richard Wynne said. \nTreasurer Tim Pallas said housing blocks are much more affordable in Melbourne than Sydney and he wants to keep it that way. \nA three-bedroom house at Cloverton would cost about $400,000, he said, compared to $750,000 in Sydney. \n\"We're getting on and delivering the policies that will assure Victorians, certainly so far as the supply debate is concerned, that is the amount of housing stock that is available into the market,\" Mr Pallas said. Land size a big factor for new homeowners Photo: Melissa Kolbe and Daniel Makertich plan to start building their home in May. (ABC News: Gloria Kalache) \nMelissa Kolbe and Daniel Makertich bought land at Kalkallo and plan to start building in May. \nThe couple, who are from nearby Craigieburn, are not worried about being a long way out of Melbourne. \n\"I think it's more the location, [we're] close to our family and friends,\" Ms Kolbe said of the reasons for their decision. \n\"Transport, knowing there will be a future train station linking up to Donnybrook and also [we're] close to the Hume Highway, [so we've got] great access. \n\"You're not too far out but still everything in one community.\" \nMr Makertich said the affordability of a large-sized block made the decision to buy there easy. \n\"The masterplan sold us. Having eight schools planned in the area, sporting facilities, that definitely helped us make the decision,\" he said. \nMr Pallas said the Government's spending on infrastructure had increased from a ten year average of $4.9 billion a year to $8.4 billion dollars and was getting larger. \n\"What does that translate to? Here in the northern suburbs [that] translates to a Mernda rail line, [and] an outer suburban arterial road program of $1.8 billion for western suburbs of Melbourne,\" he said. \n\"In the very near future we'll be unveiling comparable packages for the northern suburbs and south-eastern suburbs of metropolitan Melbourne in those growth areas.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:22:03.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
