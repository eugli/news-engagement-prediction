Tom Brady did not come all this way to lose the Super Bowl to Roger Goodell (Atlanta Falcons also playing). He just didn’t. \n\n\nBut while I’ve got you here, I HATE the #OneMore hashtag the Pats have been using for this. Stop tweeting it. One more? One more what? Who the hell just wants one more? Four more, five more, fucking ten more. That’s what the hashtag should be. None of this one more business. #fourmorefivermorefuckingtenmore is what I’m here for.
