Park rangers removed the sign before 1pm\nPolice are trying to figure out who sneaked up the base of the Statue of Liberty Tuesday to hang a banner that read 'Refugees Welcome'.\nThe 3ft by 20ft banner hung on the statue for over an hour off of the observation deck.\nPark rangers removed it just before 1pm Tuesday.\nA Twitter account titled Alt Lady Liberty took credit for the stunt.\nThe account tweeted: 'We have no formal group – just private citizens who felt like we needed to say something about the America we believe in.'\nOne of the people behind the account told NBC 4 New York : 'Speaking personally – my grandparents met in a refugee camp after WWII, and my mother immigrated. So this touches close to home.\n'But almost every American knows an immigrant or a refugee. We wanted to send a reminder about America when we're at our best – the country that's a beacon of freedom to the world, built by immigrants. Walling off countries or entire religions is against our values.'\nThe stunt came as the Department of Homeland Security tightened immigration laws and proposed expedited deportation proceedings.\nAlt Lady Liberty took credit on Twitter for the banner hanging from the observation deck\nPeople posted photos of the banner that read 'Refugees Welcome' before it was taken down\nToday White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters during the press conference: 'Those people who are in this country and pose a threat to our public safety, or have committed a crime, will be the first to go.\n'And we will be aggressively making sure that occurs. That is what the priority is.'\nAttaching banners to national monuments is not permitted.

Kennedy International Airport on January 28\nFrederic Auguste Bartholdi (left) designed the Statue of Liberty, possibly modeling her after a Muslim woman he met while traveling in Egypt\nPresident Trump's travel ban targeted people migrating from seven Muslim majority countries. Ironically, the Statue of Liberty, a symbol of democracy, may have been inspired by a Muslim woman.\nIn late 2015, it was revealed that French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi traveled to Egypt in 1855-1856. There, he developed a 'passion for large-scale public monuments and colossal sculptures,' said the U.S. National Park Service, which guards the Statue of Liberty in New York.\nWhen the Egyptian government sought proposals in 1869 to build a lighthouse for the Suez Canal, Bartholdi designed a huge statue of a robed woman holding a torch, which he called 'Egypt (or Progress) Brings Light to Asia.'\nThe sculpture originally took the 'form of a veiled peasant woman,' explained Barry Moreno, who has written about the statue, as Quote: d by the US-funded Smithsonian Institution.\n'Bartholdi produced a series of drawings in which the proposed statue began as a gigantic female fellah, or Arab peasant, and gradually evolved into a colossal goddess,' added Edward Berenson, who has also written about the subject.\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF LADY LIBERTY Designed by Frederic Bartholdi, the statue is a neo-classical sculpture representing the Roman Goddess of Freedom, Libertas.\nShe was a present to America from France to celebrate her independence and was erected in 1886 in Upper New York Bay on Liberty Island.\nBartholdi's inspiration for the statue was a comment made by politician Édouard René de Laboulaye in mid-1865, when he stated: 'If a monument should rise in the United States, as a memorial to their independence, I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort - a common work of both our nations.'\nBartholdi was also present at the dinner - and the rest is history.\nShe makes for a truly exhilarating sight for anyone entering New York.\nThe main body of the statue stands at 151ft high, but with the pedestal included, reaches 305ft.\nShe has been featured in several Hollywood flicks, including Independence Day, Cloverfield, The Day After Tomorrow, and, of course, Planet Of The Apes, where she appears buried in a beach.", "external_links": ["http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Refugees-Welcome-Banner-Unfurled-Statue-of-Liberty-414405873.html"], "published": "2017-02-22T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:08:31.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
