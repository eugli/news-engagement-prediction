No woman would be safe if he (convicted serial rapist Selva Kumar Subbiah, 56, who was deported back to Malaysia following the completion of his 24-year prison term in Canada) is allowed to roam freely. \nHe may be in his late 50s, but that does not stop him from going back to his old habits. Now just out of prison after so long, he could be hungry for sex. \nWake Up: If he is allowed to come back, then he should not be allowed moved freely. \nThe best place for him is to do a job in the police department premises so that he is under the eyes of the police at all times. \nPDev Anand Pillai: He seems pretty old now but we just don't know. Perhaps he can be detained at the pleasure of the king like they do for juveniles until the authorities are satisfied that he is not a threat to society any longer. \nMalaysia too will be an alien place to him now after being away for 37 years. \nDr Suresh Kumar: It's true he has served his time long enough, nevertheless, we can't be sure if he will go back to his old habit. But he has a right to remain free. \nTherefore, firstly, he should be sent for psychiatric evaluation. Secondly, he should be fitted with an electronic tag to monitor his movements and thirdly, he should be ordered to report to the nearest police station two weeks once, if not weekly. \nAnonymous_4171: As Malaysians, we seem to be in the limelight for the wrong reasons. I doubt this man will ever change. Hope I am wrong. \nStraight-talk: Malaysia already has many sex predators languishing in our jails. To welcome home another sex predator who has served his time abroad will only add to the long list of such offenders. \nIt is a tough decision for the lawmen. \nPolice to serial rapist: We'll be watching you \nTime for Change: Inspector-general of police (IGP) Khalid Abu Bakar, since you feel monitoring/keeping taps do not guarantee prevention of sexual assault, I humbly suggest to you to offer him a job in a prison where he has no contact whatsoever with females and is not allowed to leave the compound without being accompanied by police. \nHornbill: Who says 56 is old? He's not that old; and if he ate well and did regular exercise I'm sure he's healthy and still virile at this age. \nGood luck to the IGP, and do tweet often to inform us of his whereabouts, won't you? \nBob the Builder: Yes, put an electronic chip in him to trace his whereabouts. \nWhether the ‘lion’ was peeling oranges or pomelos is not the point \nAnonymous 2362021442199789: It is a sorry state of affairs when an innocuous, trivial incident becomes a major talking point. It just goes to show how low the esteemed office of the PM is perceived/held nowadays by many ordinary Malaysians. \nWhilst this incident may have been played up by the opposition for 'political' reasons, there is also the real possibility that this may be the precursor of a civil disobedience movement ala Mahatma Gandhi where the ordinary man in the street shows his displeasure by simple, peaceful means. \nUnder such circumstances, with the loss of confidence in the leadership, there is only one possible final outcome in a democratic society, but the outcome is less predictable in a kleptocratic one. Time will tell. \n6th Generation Immigrant: Indeed, this article has in fact identified the root cause (all the people's reactions) of Malaysia's ills – the people have lost complete belief, faith and trust in the government and their leaders. \nThe rights or wrongs in every move our leaders make, whether truthful or misinformation, are just fodder for the people to express their \"dissatisfaction with the government”. \nJust compare these to all the articles coming out from people all over the world related to Donald Trump - these are from those who have no belief, faith and trust in the new President of the United States (Potus). \nBut then, the US is a world leader and Malaysia is a minnow. \nAnonymous #03815719: Thank you, Stephen Ng, for such a wonderful article. Gerakan is in disarray, so its Youth chief Tan Keng Liang is pleasing his boss by speaking out. \nThis speaks volume about the event. No amount of denying by Tan is going to salvage the damaged image of Najib because of Gerakan's lion dance. \nDiscovery: I had met this Gerakan hot-shot when he was a young lawyer in Alor Setar. He's actually quite smart, but since he joined Gerakan his image has somewhat fallen in the eyes of the Chinese community. \nYou just need to go around the coffee shops in Kedah and hear what people have to say about him. \nMalaysia4All: When 1MDB is mentioned, Gerakan is asked to stay silent, and they faithfully do so. The rakyat are rightfully concerned about the shenanigans happening with respect to the 1MDB scandal. \nWhy don’t Gerakan members speak up about 1MDB, instead of raising other, totally non-relevant issues? \nKingfisher: Tan Keng Liang's explanation of the lion dance merits consideration. \nHowever, notwithstanding whatever the genuine reasons were for the seeming non-performance of the lion dance for what seemed ‘many’ obvious seconds in the video clip, the perception of many if not all who viewed the very brief ‘show’ will not be favourable towards the dignitaries, including unfortunately the PM. \nThe lion dancers have perhaps left an indelible impression on those who are prejudiced to perceive unfavourably that while you may have the power and authority, you shall not have our deference. \nLion dance troupe cries foul over 'cheap politicking' \nChiew Sien Hoong: Stop all this nonsense. The lion dance is supposed to bring in the joy to the grand occasion. \nWith or without VIPs, the lion dancers performed to the best of their abilities to preserve the dignity and grace of Chinese traditions and culture. \nLet’s not think too much, as it reflects the narrow-mindedness of the accusers. \nBright Light: When a leader has a ‘trust deficit’, and supposedly lost the respect from the people and legitimacy to lead, at whatever event, the people will ‘mock’ him. \nGreat, let the lion peel the cover and smokescreen of the 1MDB fiasco layer by layer to unmask who was behind it. What a symbolic event. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers. Only paying subscribers can post comments.
