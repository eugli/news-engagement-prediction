Don’t let them take over your life. In this exclusive Lifescript interview, an expert sheds light on migraine causes, treatments and the latest developments... A migraine is no ordinary headache. The pain is intense and throbbing, even debilitating. Women who suffer from them often can’t function at work or even perform ordinary tasks. Yet many women don’t know they have them. “About 45% of women with migraine are never diagnosed,” says Deborah I. Friedman, MD, MPH, a professor of neurology and neurotherapeutics and director of the Headache and Facial Pain Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. That’s because women — or their doctors — often dismiss their pain as being a tension or sinus headache. In fact, migraine is misdiagnosed almost as often as it is correctly diagnosed, says the National Headache Foundation. Still, they’re surprisingly common — affecting about 18% of women in the United States, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. Women are three times more likely than men to experience migraine attacks. A long laundry list of factors, from perfume to processed meat, chocolate and cigarette smoke can trigger migraines. Reaching for over-the-counter headache medicine often doesn’t bring relief. In fact, if you take pain relievers too often, they even can bring on an attack or make a bad headache worse. These medication-overused headaches are called “rebound headaches.” So the first step to treatment — and relief — is to see a doctor, have a neurological examination and get a diagnosis. “Migraine is very treatable,” Dr. Friedman says. “We have never had so many good options as we do now [and] the majority of [our] patients do very well with good control of their headaches.” How to make that happen for you? In this exclusive Lifescript interview, Dr. Friedman shares her knowledge about preventing and treating migraine headaches. What are some clues that a bad headache is a migraine? Migraine is the most common recurring severe headache. It’s often throbbing, accompanied by sensitivity to light, noise and odors. It gets worse with routine physical activity, such as walking, climbing stairs or bending over. Some patients have nausea or vomiting. The pain is one-sided in about half of patients. The pain eventually goes away, even without treatment, although many people don’t feel normal for another 24 hours or so. Up to 48 hours before an attack, some people have a sense that a migraine is coming. They may be feeling on top of the world, have unexplained depression, food cravings (often for chocolate), frequent urination, thirst or uncontrollable yawning. What causes migraine? [It’s] a physical process. Functional imaging done in the premonitory phase — that means before the aura or headache strikes — shows [abnormal] activation of areas throughout the brain. But migraine is also frequently associated with anxiety and depression and may be triggered by stress. [Doctors] currently believe there is a genetic predisposition to having migraine. One in every three to four women have migraine, and most of those patients have close relatives who also have migraine. Specific genes have been identified for certain rare types of migraine. [ Editor’s note: From 70%-80% of sufferers has a family history of migraine, according to the National Headache Foundation.] What is migraine “aura?” These are symptoms [that some people experience] before the migraine attack, such as [Seeing] flashes, sparkles or zigzag shimmering lines Loss of vision to one side Tunnel vision Numbness or tingling that can occur anywhere Difficulty speaking Imbalance Dizziness About 25% of migraine sufferers experience these [visual disturbances]. Aura may also occur without a headache. [ Editor’s note: Migraine with aura (also called the “classic migraine”) and migraine without aura (also known as the “common migraine”) are the two most common types of migraines, according to the National Headache Foundation.] Are there other migraine types? Yes, there are several. There is a migraine with brainstem aura.
