The cameras were installed in 2015 as part of traffic management schemes.\nWhen the cameras were first installed, the council expected to make £200,000 a year in fines, with the money being re-invested in city centre infrastructure.\nThe AA and RAC says excessive fines in new schemes is an indication that there is something wrong.\nThere must have been alarm bells ringing in the council's head, because it shows that many motorists have simply been caught out. It shows that when these schemes are rolled out, the council should make sure that the schemes are adequately visible to motorists.\"\n– RAC Spokesperson 87,000 Fines on John Dobson Street 21,000 Fines on Pilgrim Street Newcastle City Council has defended the bus lane camera schemes.\nThe numbers have dropped off significantly since we've introduced the bus lanes and the fines have gone into place. All of the money will be re-invested into transport improvements and we have improved things, for the vast majority of visitors into the city\"\n– Newcastle City Council Spokesperson Tyne and Wear", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:36:00.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
