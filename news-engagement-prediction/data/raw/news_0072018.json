While the Marvel Cinematic Universe surely has power, only so much excitement can be filtered into a comic book character with a cult following. The franchise managed to turn people in favor of Guardians of the Galaxy when the intergalactic romp hit theaters, but fans were less-than-certain the same could be done to Doctor Strange . However, the mystical movie managed to rake in loads of cash at the box office, making it one of the most profitable films of 2016. \nNow, the film’s star is speaking out about what made Doctor Strange so bankable. When it comes down to it, Benedict Cumberbatch says it all came down to renovation. \nSpeaking to CinemaBlend , the actor said fans felt the movie was refreshing when compared to other ‘serious’ comic book movies. “I think a number of reasons. I think it's visually something that's a new experience. He's an interesting character and it's a nice retelling of an origin,” Cumberbatch said. \nContinuing, the star said the film has, “A nice look at certain inversions of conventions like the finale dust up being a kind of renovation job rather than a destruction job. The ultimate bad guy defeat in it being through an idea rather than some kind of gloves off showdown. And then the usual kind of key ingredients of Marvel's success I think which is to take these things that they have a great reverence for but also use a sense of humor and not be too kind of holy about and dare to do different things with the format.” \nSo, what did you think about Doctor Strange ?
