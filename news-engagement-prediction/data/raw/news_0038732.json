'In terms of Alex, he has been here before, he has seen it, he has had a very successful spell here as a manager. 'He worked with the international team and did a very good job of it as well. I don't think there would be any doubts about him coming in. Miller (left) says there would be no doubts about McLeish coming in and doing a good job Mark Warburton is seeking legal advice after his Rangers exit after almost two years in charge 'I see the words \"steadying the ship\" mentioned. I don't think it would be steadying the ship, it is about having an impact on the team and I am sure Alex would have that. 'He has been there and seen it and done it. There would be no doubts about his abilities to come in and do the job.' Interim manager Graeme Murty has been placed in charge for the foreseeable future and will take Sunday's league trip to Dundee. Warburton and his backroom team of David Weir and Frank McParland are seeking the legal backing of the League Manager's Association after disputing Rangers claims they quit. Sportsmail understands the Ibrox club have already ordered the trio to pack their bags and vacate club accommodation. McLeish lifts the Scottish Premiership trophy in 2003 after Rangers pipped Celtic to the title Graeme Murty is currently in interim charge of Rangers and will take this Sunday's match Insisting the Rangers players were 'shocked and surprised' by Warburton's departure, Miller has urged directors to aim high in the search for a replacement, saying: 'You need to be a winner. 'You need to be strong, you need to be thick-skinned. To be a manager not just of Rangers, but of any of the Old Firm clubs, is a tough job. 'When things are not going exactly according to plan you need to try to avoid getting too caught up in what is said about you in all outlets; social media, mainstream media. 'You are under the microscope 24/7 and it's important you stick to your plan. Stick to the job you believe in. There is a lot of really good qualities required if you are going to be successful.' Warburton (right) came out on the wrong side of the Old Firm derby on the last three occasions McLeish (centre) is currently working in the media but would consider a return to Ibrox Emphasising the need for stability following the dispute over Warburton's exit, Miller added: 'The DoF and head coach has been mentioned a lot and if that's going to be the route we go down then it sounds to me like we have a plan in place. 'That sounds really positive to me. Maybe it is a bit of a change from the norm in Scotland. 'But if there is continuity and the club are on a path the firmly believe in - because you need to be committed - it can't go up in the air when a manager leaves. 'That continuity is important to us moving forward.' Miller admitted his own contract situation has been put on the back burner until the new management structure is fixed, the former Scotland striker adding: 'We need to sort out the path the club is going to go down and sort out the new manager before any of that stuff happens.'
