However, the government launched a three-year sex study last year to address reports claiming that their sexual appetites are waning. \nSocial Democrat and Public Health Minister Gabriel Wikstrom said at the time that it was the government’s duty to investigate whether sexual activity was lagging due to health issues. \n“In fact, if the social conditions for pleasurable sex are deteriorating – due to stress or health problems – this is, in itself, a political problem,” Wikstrom wrote in Dagens Nyahter in announcing the study, which is due to be completed in 2019. \nREAD MORE: Pig mask public sex couple cause traffic jam in Sweden \nWikstrom’s like-minded Social Democrat colleague, Per Erik Muskos, has also touted sex breaks as a potential remedy for stress. \n“I believe that sex is a scarce commodity in many long relationships. Everyday life is stressful and the children are at home. This could be an opportunity to have their own time,” Muskos told Vasterbottens-Kuriren .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:19:21.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
