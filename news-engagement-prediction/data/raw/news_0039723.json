No sooner has a make-up artist slicked a line of kohl across a model’s eye that we know the exact look of the show via social media. From the lipstick used at Burberry to the eyeshadow donned at Prada, you can feel like you’re backstage with a click of an app. Boy do we love 21st century technology. \nHere is your list of our favourite make-up artists to follow ahead of London Fashion Week (get cracking guys, it’s only a mere few days away). Pat McGrath on @patmcgrathreal A post shared by Pat McGrath (@patmcgrathreal) on Oct 17, 2015 at 10:21am PDT \nA n early adopter of backstage Instagramming, Ms McGrath is one to get on your radar, like, right now. She does so many of the top shows, from Prada to Dolce & Gabbana, creating the look of the season. Last September, she even unveiled swatches of her first ever product, a multi-purpose gold shimmer powder. Safe to say we’re expecting big things this season, Pat. No pressure.
