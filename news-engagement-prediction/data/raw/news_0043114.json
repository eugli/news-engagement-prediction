By Jonathan Saltzman Globe Staff February 21, 2017 \nFour former employees of the prestigious Milton Academy engaged in sexual misconduct with students decades ago, including a drama teacher who abused at least 12 male students before he was fired in 1987, school officials disclosed Tuesday. \nThe drama teacher, Rey Buono, moved to Southeast Asia the year after he was fired and has worked at theater companies and schools there since then, according to his LinkedIn profile, which says he currently works as a freelance director. He directed the theater program in Milton Academy’s upper school from 1973 to 1987.

The school wrote in a letter to the community that it has reported the allegations to “appropriate officials and law enforcement agencies,’’ including, in the case of Buono, immigration authorities. \n“Several decades ago this institution failed to protect some of the young people in its care,’’ wrote school head Todd Bland and Lisa Donahue, president of the board of trustees. “On behalf of Milton Academy and its board of trustees, we want to acknowledge and deeply apologize for those failures.” Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

But Buono continued to work at the school until 1987, “when he admitted to sexually abusing a student and his employment was terminated,’’ it said.

The school said each of those three employees was male and each victim was a female minor. The misconduct ranged from lewd comments to sexual intercourse. Most of the incidents occurred on campus but were not reported at the time to the school administration, the letter said. \nSchool officials were not immediately available for comment Tuesday.
