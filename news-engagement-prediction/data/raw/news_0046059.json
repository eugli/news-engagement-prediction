Ad Feedback \n\"So he was somewhat fortunate that the [inspector] picked up on this because he stood to be the person who was most poisoned.\" \nWorkSafe prosecutor Celene O'Brien disputed that, saying both employees and customers were at risk from exposure to the chemical. \nThe danger was heightened by the salon's lack of extraction fan or vent, she said. \nJudge Collins said it was well-known within the beauty industry that MMA shouldn't be used, and there were \"ample\" other products that did the same job safely. \nHe set a fine starting point of $20,000 but deducted $6500 for the salon's early guilty plea, its lack of previous convictions, and other mitigating factors. \n- Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:09:35.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
