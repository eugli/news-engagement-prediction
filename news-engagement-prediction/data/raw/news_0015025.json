PUBLISHED: 21:55,   22:05, Sat, Feb 4, 2017 \nHoping for the best, Charlene had earlier tweeted: \"We've got a cat live in the studio with me later... I'm not a huge cat fan. So this will be interesting. See you for @itvlondon NOW!\" \nUnfortunately for the 36-year-old journalist, while she was speaking to a vet and a cat owner about obesity among pets on live air, things got a little out of hand. \nViewers watched as the cat went rogue and wandered across the desk as Charlene tried to keep her composure. \nGiggling as Sammy the cat then hid under the desk in the green screen studio, Charlene said: \"Oh, now Sammy's coming to hang out with me, there will be more tips after the show, oh gosh, he's now disappeared underneath the desk. I think I might have lost the cat somehow!\" Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:12:31.571+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
