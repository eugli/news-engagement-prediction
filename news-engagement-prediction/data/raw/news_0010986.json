The Falcons had been called for three holding penalties on the drive, including one on Robert Alford. Well, Alford made up for it with a pick-six of Tom Brady. Alford went 82 yards, which seemed like a fair trade for the three holds. Tom Brady was understandably dejected: The Falcons now lead 21-0, and will get the ball at halftime. Teams with INT Return TD in Super Bowl are 12-0. — Katie Sharp (@ktsharp) February 6, 2017 In this Storystream", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:56:46.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
