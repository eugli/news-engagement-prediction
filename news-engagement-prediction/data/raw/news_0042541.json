foreign or domestic - have been welcomed by the cattle industry . \nRenowned Territory cattleman Ian McBean, who came to the north in 1952 and went on to own several stations, said the local beef sector had been developed for decades with the support of both Australian and overseas-based investors. \n\"You need that capital to come in to better your infrastructure, better your genetics and increase the productivity of the area,\" he said. \nMr McBean said the ownership of properties should be irrelevant provided they were managed well. \n\"I suppose my fear of any big corporate or overseas-owned property is the quality of management, the knowledge of management,\" he said. \n\"I consider that actual experience, on the ground working stock, is still very important. \n\"But by the same token I don't knock the financial knowledge, and also the knowledge of different grasses and the genetics that are coming into the industry now.\" \nThe major pastoral companies, which have a number of shareholders as opposed to being controlled by an individual, have significantly more land in their respective portfolios. \nAustralian Agricultural Company holds 39,100 square kilometres, Consolidated Pastoral Company has 31,700 square kilometres and North Australian Pastoral Company owns 21,900 square kilometres. \nMr McBean said the size of a property was not generally a good indication of value, but rather the stock carrying capacity of the land. \n\"That's where your productivity comes from - from the number of calves you can get on the ground,\" he said. \n\"You can have the biggest place in the world, but if it's got a low carrying capacity, you're not going to get the financial return that you're going to get out of a smaller place that can carry more cattle.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:17:32.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
