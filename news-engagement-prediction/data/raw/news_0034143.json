And the bookies’ favourite is a Tory unknown who joined the party only last year. At a time in the electoral cycle when the Opposition should be causing mayhem for a Government with a tiny majority, the reverse is true. And having spent a week travelling all over both these constituencies, it is not hard to identify the root cause of Labour’s woes: Jeremy Corbyn. Labour supporters always try to blame the ‘Right-wing media’ for stirring up non-existent party troubles and demonising their leader. But it was two Labour MPs who created this epic mess when they decided they could no longer face serving under Mr Corbyn. Right now Labour desperately needs its core vote more than ever. Historically, this solidly working-class West Midlands seat has loyally returned anything wearing a red rosette. Pictured, Labour candidate Gareth Snell Stoke’s Tristram Hunt and Copeland’s Jamie Reed were both respected, conscientious MPs. And both have now abandoned the Labour benches for plum jobs elsewhere. Both were resolutely opposed to the election of Jeremy Corbyn as party leader. It is clear that much of the electorate — and both Labour candidates in these by-elections — share that view. In more than 25 years of covering by-elections, I am pushed to recall twin election counts to match this pair. It’s true that we occasionally exaggerate some of these contests when they are little more than a snapshot of regional concerns. But these two are different, particularly in Stoke. I can’t think of a by-election in which the atmosphere has been so toxic, nor one in which so many candidates are treated by minders like imbecilic incendiary devices. It is currently easier to ascertain the travel movements of the Queen than those of Labour candidate Gareth Snell. His minders won’t even tell the Guardian where he is to be found. I finally catch him in the pouring rain outside the Royal Stoke Hospital talking to a local radio station and raise the subject of those dreadful tweets. A Ukip win would be a sign it has come of age as a credible parliamentary party and also a signal that, on its present course, Labour’s future as Britain’s principal opposition is in grave danger He deals with it well enough. ‘I am sure a university is drawing up a social media course using me as a prime example of what not to do,’ he admits, adding that he is deeply embarrassed and has apologised to his wife. ‘She was very clear I shouldn’t have said those things,’ he says. ‘I feel I have let her down. I’m sorry.’ It is not clear whether he also apologised to the ‘IRA supporting friend of Hamas’ during Mr Corbyn’s fleeting visit to the seat earlier in the campaign. So, has he now deleted every last tweet? ‘There’s one candidate that’s tried to delete his past,’ he counters, ‘and that’s Paul Nuttall.’ It’s equally hard to pin down Mr Nuttall, too. For two days this week, he simply vanished from the campaign trail, citing his duties as party leader. It is currently easier to ascertain the travel movements of the Queen than those of Labour candidate Gareth Snell (left). His minders won’t even tell the Guardian where he is to be found But he admits this was mainly to do with the Hillsborough disaster, that dreadful 1989 FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield which he attended, aged 12, with his father. He has now had to apologise for a statement on his website in which he claimed that he lost ‘close friends’ that day. Not true, it turns out. The blame has since been pinned on the press officer who issued the faulty statement. But what has hurt Mr Nuttall much more is the rumour that he was never at Hillsborough in the first place, a suggestion he has vehemently denied. For a Liverpool FC season-ticket holder like himself, to lie about such a thing would be heresy of the worst kind. So what does he have to say? It’s equally hard to pin down Mr Nuttall, too (pictured). For two days this week, he simply vanished from the campaign trail, citing his duties as party leader After two days in search of the Ukip leader, I am finally invited to wait on a street corner in Stoke and then escorted to meet him at a secret hotel location. He seems drained and genuinely subdued by the whole experience. ‘This has been absolutely the lowest point of my political career,’ he says softly, explaining that he has been in Liverpool having ‘conversations with people who matter’. He won’t say what was discussed, though some members of his family have urged him to abandon politics for good. ‘But I’m going to win this. It’s made me more determined.’ He talks me through his boyhood memories of the day he got in a van with his father and uncles and drove to Sheffield ‘over the Woodhead Pass’, of sitting in the relative safety of the upper tier of the Leppings Lane grandstand, of his father realising something was badly wrong and saying: ‘We’re off.’ Mr Nuttal has had allegations thrown at him this week, namely that he has also fabricated a PhD and a previous career as a professional footballer. Both errors, he says, were due to members of staff overstating the facts The fact that someone is now suggesting he has made it up has, he says, been ‘asbolutely awful’. So awful, indeed, that he chuckles over some of the other allegations thrown at him this week, namely that he has also fabricated a PhD and a previous career as a professional footballer. Both errors, he says, were due to members of staff overstating the facts. He explains that he was a schoolboy goalkeeper for the Tranmere Rovers youth team — he recalls being humiliated by a Manchester United side featuring a teenage Paul Scholes — and says he was halfway through his PhD on inter-war politics on Merseyside when he switched careers. ‘Once I finish politics, I want to go back and finish it. I’ve never called myself Dr Nuttall.’ So why are his minders treating him like someone from a witness protection scheme? In addition to the odd hurled egg, he says he has had to move out of his original constituency digs after two break-in attempts. ‘The returning officer said: “It’s best you don’t stay there”.’ Meanwhile, the police have received a complaint that Mr Nuttall committed an electoral offence by listing this same property as his home when he was not living in it. The paperwork is certainly piling up for the cops as the campaigns report each other’s dirty tricks. The most memorable, so far, is the Labour campaigner who was caught warning Muslim voters that they face eternal damnation if they vote Liberal Democrat. Labour campaigner Navid Hussain has been circulating text messages among Stoke’s Islamic community saying that because Labour is in danger from the ‘anti-Islamic’ forces of Ukip, it is every Muslim’s religious duty to vote Labour. A vote for the Lib Dems, he goes on, will merely help ‘the enemies of Islam’. ‘Will you be able to answer for this in the grave?’ asks Mr Hussain, who boasts a photograph of himself hugging Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Labour campaigners have had to lock away their gaffe-prone candidate, Gareth Snell, after his loose-fingered Twitter past came back to haunt him To cap it all, the Liberal Democrat candidate happens to be Muslim, too. Dr Zulfiqar Ali, a mild-mannered consultant cardiologist and former councillor, is bemused because Mr Hussain had originally offered to campaign for him. What also irks him is that several local businesses had erected Lib Dem posters only to take them down again after threats from people he believes to be Labour supporters. ‘They are clearly rattled,’ he says. The Lib Dems are expected to enjoy a rise in their vote here. This may be Brexit territory, but the 30 per cent who voted Remain last year have nowhere else to go. The picture is more confused for the Tories whose candidate, Jack Brereton, became a local councillor at 19. Labour’s weakening grip on Stoke is reflected by the fact that, at the age of 25, Mr Brereton is now in charge of the city’s £500 million regeneration budget and a senior player in the Independent/Tory/Ukip coalition which runs the city council. Stoke-born and bred, he is clearly destined for higher things: Ukip’s Paul Nuttall calls him ‘super-impressive’. Yet Tory high command has not despatched big battalions to help. Only a cynic, surely, would suggest that Conservative national HQ would like to see a Ukip victory here. I head out to Stoke’s vast Bentilee estate, a place where Union flags and the Cross of St George outnumber all political posters put together. Staunchly Labour in the past, it is a key Ukip battleground. Meanwhile, the police have received a complaint that Mr Nuttall committed an electoral offence by listing this same property as his home when he was not living in it Once the biggest council estate in Europe, Bentilee now boasts a new record — the most Eurosceptic spot in Britain. While Stoke’s overall Leave vote in the referendum was 70 per cent, the Bentilee ward recorded a thumping 87 per cent. Wandering its streets, I find the overwhelming response is ‘stuff the lot of them’. Nine in ten people refuse to waste their breath on the by-election subject. And each time the one in ten says ‘Ukip’. Take Mark Bailey, 20, a stage builder who didn’t bother voting at the last election. He is voting Ukip this week ‘to get things changed’. The Labour fatigue is similar in Copeland. Its main town, Whitehaven, was once a proud fishing and coal-mining community. Today, its main industry is servicing the Sellafield nuclear plant up the road. And Labour has the hurdle of explaining away Jeremy Corbyn’s historic belief that nuclear power should be abolished, even if he now accepts his party’s position in favour of it. Copeland without nuclear power would be like Scotland without whisky. When you drive out to Sellafield and see this heavily-fortified monster — think Heathrow minus the planes — you grasp its importance to the whole region. Come the end of the afternoon shift, there are so many vehicles pouring out of here that there are traffic jams for miles around. The Labour candidate, Gillian Troughton, certainly gets it. At every public meeting, she insists that her party is wholly behind nuclear power. ‘No ifs, no buts,’ she says time and again. As with Mr Snell, Labour initially tried to shield Mrs Troughton from the pesky Press. Then someone twigged that as a former hospital doctor and trained ambulance driver, it might be a good idea to let her loose. After all, Labour is fighting proposals to relocate much of the local hospital’s services to Carlisle, an hour’s drive away. ‘The most poignant moment of this campaign has been meeting a young lad who would have died without the A&E we have here,’ says Mrs Troughton as she hands out leaflets in the centre of town. The Tory candidate, Trudy Harrison, is firmly opposed to the hospital move, too, but is focusing on better roads and support for the vast new nuclear plant due to go up alongside the existing one. ‘My Dad worked at Sellafield, my husband, brother and cousins are there,’ she says, adding that one of her four daughters is training to be a Sellafield electrician, too. Ukip, the Lib Dems and Greens all have strong candidates but it’s a two-horse race. And Labour’s tribal vote is slipping here too. In Whitehaven, the bookies give the Conservatives a narrow lead over Labour. Back in Stoke, they put Labour ahead of Ukip by a whisker. But anything could happen between now and Thursday. The stakes are certainly high for Mr Nuttall. But they are higher still for Mr Corbyn. Defeat in these two seats and that trickle of Labour MPs already heading for the exit could become a flood.
