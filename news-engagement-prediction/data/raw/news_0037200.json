Friday, got sick/gastro for 5 days. Guess I have an idea where it came from now...\" Heatwave to blame: Central Cafe \nCentral Cafe owner Yaman Kasirga blamed last week's heatwave for the prohibition notice, but said he was not aware of anyone becoming sick after eating at his cafe. Photo: The Central Cafe cool room struggled in the heat, its owner said. (ABC News: Jana Black) \n\"The cool room probably couldn't cope with it. As you know all the food comes from the cool room,\" he said. \n\"It was a very hot day when (the health inspectors) arrived. 41 degrees [Celsius] ... that was one of the major issues. \n\"I apologise to our customers, to our dear clients. Thank them for their support and their patience but trust me we'll be back on the road.\" \nRicardo's Cafe has been contacted for comment.
