In response to the video, several outlets have published follow-up pieces on the matter. \nHere is a small sample of what some of YouTube’s top stars have to say. Markiplier, Current Subscriber Count: Over 16 million \nMarkiplier, real name Mark Fischbach, deals with the issue by bringing up the ideal of “respect on a basic human level” and “common human decency.” Fischbach begins the video in general terms, discussing how someone can be hated for their actions but still need to be treated with respect, before dealing more specifically with PewDiePie. \n“I want to be very clear about something, Felix is not an anti-Semite and Felix does not advocate hate, and I’m not even defending the jokes that he made because even he has apologized… but he as a person, as a human being, he’s not these labels,” Fischbach says. “When it comes to dehumanizing someone or anyone, I won’t stand for that, because at the end of the day there’s going to be people that follow us and it’s up to you and me to show them what respect really means.” \nREAD MORE: PewDiePie dropped by Disney after anti-Semitic stunt Philip DeFranco, Current Subscriber Count: Over 5 million \nPhilip DeFranco, whose channel consists of a daily show recapping news and pop culture and presenting his own opinion on the news, posted a video which laid out the whole saga and then echoed PewDiePie’s feeling that he is being attacked by the media. \n“The Wall Street Journal and all these other outlets, they 100% want to have a bead on the forehead of PewDiePie and that is because Felix brings in the clicks, outrage brings in the clicks, get them in with the headline and whatever happens after happens,” DeFranco says. \nREAD MORE: YouTube Space opens Toronto studio: How budding creators can turn YouTube into a career \nLater in the video, DeFranco says that the media’s reaction has made outlets “look silly” and has “added to the conversation of why (they) should not be trusted.” \n“Thanks to you in the media, the way that all of you rushed to cover without looking for context, you have made him the temporary face and put him front and center in the conversation of free speech,” DeFranco argues. “And in the story of the media trying to take down people for saying things that they don’t like, or they think are offensive, the media will literally try and ruin your career if you make jokes about things that offend them, you have only made him stronger and more important.” KSI, Current Subscriber Count: Nearly 16 million \nKSI, a British YouTuber and rapper whose real name is Olajide Olatunji and who last year starred in the movie “Laid in America,” weighed into the debate via Twitter. \nFirst, he tweeted PewDiePie’s apology video with the accompanying message, “We’re fully behind you bro,” before adding that he relates to PewDiePie’s current predicament, describing the media’s coverage of YouTube’s most-watched personality as a “witch hunt.” I can relate to pewdie cos i've been in the EXACT same situation and it fucking sucks. It's a disgusting witch hunt. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:11:32.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
