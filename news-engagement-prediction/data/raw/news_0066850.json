And we will not allow ourselves to be divided by the result. 'Nor will we be divided by race, or faith, or creed. We will move forward together to tackle the problems that we face and secure a brighter, more prosperous future for one another. 'So for those who have come to Stoke-on-Trent to sow hatred and division, and to try to turn us away from our friends and neighbours, I have one message â€“ you have failed. 'Tonight the people of Stoke-on-Trent have chosen the politics of hope over the politics of fear. We have said with one voice that hatred and bigotry are not welcome here. This is a proud city and we stand together.' 'I am proud to call the Potteries my home, and I am prouder still to have been elected its next member of Parliament.' COPELAND SEAT RESULTS Trudy Harrison (C) 13,748 (44.25%, +8.46%) Gillian Troughton (Lab) 11,601 (37.34%, -4.92%) Rebecca Hanson (LD) 2,252 (7.25%, +3.80%) Fiona Mills (UKIP) 2,025 (6.52%, -9.00%) Michael Guest (Ind) 811 (2.61%) Jack Lenox (Green) 515 (1.66%, -1.32%) Roy Ivinson (Ind) 116 (0.37%) Labour party candidate Gareth Snell hugs his wife Sophia after winning the Stoke Central by-election A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said: 'Labour's excellent campaign has won a clear victory in an election Ukip and the Tories threw everything at' Labour candidate Gareth Snell retained the seat for the party with 7,853 votes, after a turnout of 38 per cent Labour candidate Gareth Snell retained the seat for the party with 7,853 votes, after a turnout of 38 per cent It was thought that Ukip's Paul Nuttall would provide strong competition, but the party's leader finished in xx place, after his campaign was marred by a number of controversies Votes are counted at Fenton Sports Centre in the Stoke-On-Trent Central by-election Mr Corbyn said: 'Labour's victory in Stoke is a decisive rejection of UKIP's politics of division. But our message was not enough to win through in Copeland. 'Labour listened to 1000s of voters on the doorstep. Both constituencies, like so many, have been let down by the political establishment. 'Labour's victory in Stoke is a decisive rejection of UKIP's politics of division. But our message was not enough to win through in Copeland.' Defeated Ukip candidate Mr Nuttall claimed the seat was only 72nd on his party's hitlist. He said: 'We are not going anywhere and I am not going anywhere. 'We will go on and have success in the future.' Pressed on the Hillsborough, he said: 'The whole Hillsborough issue wasn't an issue on the doorsteps here in Stoke-on-Trent. 'Labour got their machine out on the day, we did our best, we have fallen short this time but our time will come.' Defeated Ukip candidate Mr Nuttall claimed the seat was only 72nd on his party's hitlist Ukip candidate and party leader Paul Nuttall (left) during counting in the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election The contests were triggered by the resignations of the sitting Labour MPs Jamie Reed, who left for a job at Sellafield, and Tristram Hunt, who quit to become director of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Labour's Stoke campaign was dogged by the controversial views of Mr Snell. He was forced to issue an apology after making a number of disparaging remarks about women on social media. He has also courted criticism by describing Brexit as a 'massive pile of s***', in a constituency where almost 70 per cent of people voted to leave the EU. But the row was overshadowed by controversy about Mr Nuttall who was forced to apologise for a statement on his website saying he had lost close friends in the Hillsborough stadium disaster. Polls closed in two crunch by-elections last night in Labour heartlands where the party faced fierce challenges from the Conservatives and Ukip. STOKE-ON-TRENT CENTRAL VOTE Gareth Snell (Lab) 7,853 (37.09%, -2.22%) Paul Nuttall (UKIP) 5,233 (24.72%, +2.07%) Jack Brereton (C) 5,154 (24.35%, +1.80%) Zulfiqar Ali (LD) 2,083 (9.84%, +5.67%) Adam Colclough (Green) 294 (1.39%, -2.22%) Barbara Fielding (Ind) 137 (0.65%) The Incredible Flying Brick (Loony) 127 (0.60%) David Furness (BNP) 124 (0.59%) Godfrey Davies (CPA) 109 (0.51%) Mohammed Akram (Ind) 56 (0.26%) Labour party candidate Gareth Snell (second from right) during counting in the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election Voter turnout was 38.16 per cent in Stoke-on-Trent Central and 51.35 per cent in Copeland. Liberal Democrat Leader Tim Farron predicted Ukip had failed to take the Stoke seat. He said: 'This is the beginning of the end for Ukip. They no longer have a purpose. 'Theresa May has adopted Farage's approach to Brexit and her government has become indistinguishable from Ukip. 'Only the Liberal Democrats are standing up against hard Brexit for a Britain that is open, tolerant and united.' Voter turnout was 38.16 per cent in Stoke-on-Trent Central and 51.35 per cent in Copeland Meanwhile, Ukip chairman Paul Oakden insisted that Mr Nuttall would remain as leader despite the crushing defeat. He said: 'He has a well-earned rest and then he comes back and leads our party, I suspect. 'The whole narrative of Paul's leadership depends on winning in Stoke is a nonsense. 'The membership are behind Paul, they want him to be leader of the party, he wants to be leader of the party and whatever the result here is, that's not going to change.'
