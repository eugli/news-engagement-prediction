The lounge stage included sets from Saints From Silence , Second Hand Smoke and Kougaran . \nOver at the main stage, George Aneed and The Law Abiding Citizens kicked things off with a bang and a rocking set that featured their own brand of funky rock, occasionally mixed in with a hip hop flavor. \nNext up was No Resolve , who drew the largest crowd of the evening. The band has been making waves with the recent release of their debut album Unity , making the Billboard Heatseeker Chart and winning Linkin Park's Stagelight Monthly Music Contest \"Get Out,\" which went over well Saturday with their enthusiastic fans. \nNo Resolve went on to play a number of tracks from the new album during their energetic set, including \"What You Wanted.\" \"The Pusher\" and \"What You Deserve.\" The tight five-piece certainly made an impression on all who made it out to the show. \nSponge spent the evening shuttling fans on a 3-venue bus trip and were more than ready to party when they took the stage. They took requests from the crowd and kicked things off with a booming version of \"Wax Ecstatic.\" \nThey went on to pull out hits \"Molly (16 Candles)\", \"Have You Seen Mary\" and \"Plowed\" and also played newer track \"The Whores Are Closing In,\" which is off their latest release, The Beer Sessions . \nAfter vocalist Vinnie Dombroski chatted with the crowd, the band also pulled out a fantastic version of The Ramone's \"I Wanna Be Sedated\" before heading out to the next venue. \nDiesel regulars, Cadre closed the evening out on the main stage with another fist-pumping set that included a passionate rendition of \"Knowing That You're Gone\", dedicated to the memory of vocalist Johnny Mascioli's uncle. \nThey also pulled out fan favorites \"Forever Chapter\", \"Treason\" and \"This Time Around.\" \nBy: Tracy Heck AXS Contributor Feb 21, 2017 Added 3 hours ago Sponsor", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:28:43.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
