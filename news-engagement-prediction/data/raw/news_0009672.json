As it happens, this was untrue , as even Sputnik International, the Russian state-supported news service that helped promote the story , acknowledged. Then there are the regular Trump Tweets calling CNN or The Times “fake news.” The Bowling Green episode made such a splash because it played directly into concerns that the Trump administration would use untrue assertions to rally support for its agenda while denigrating as “dishonest” all the valid reporting pointing out the falsehoods. But even before the Bowling Green story fell apart so spectacularly, there were signs that what had worked well during the presidential campaign last year might not succeed when it comes to the real-world work of government. All the accusations of “fake news” and “dishonest media” couldn’t erase images of crying relatives stranded at airports — or the reporting on the legal questions surrounding Mr. Trump’s immigration order that led a judge to temporarily suspend it. No one in the administration could disappear the readouts from the president’s tense call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia leaked to The Washington Post . Nor could they reverse the effects of the reporting, some of it in The Times, about the potential business conflicts of his Army secretary nominee, Vincent Viola, who withdrew his name Friday night because of them. Ditto for the blowback over the whole Bowling Green yarn. Ms. Conway went on to admit her error, first on Twitter (where else?) and later in an interview with Howard Kurtz of Fox News, saying it was overblown because “I misspoke one word.” (By that, she meant, apparently, that she should have said “Bowling Green terrorists” rather than “Bowling Green massacre.”) \n  And Ms. Conway was right when she wrote that “honest mistakes abound.” After all, The Washington Post admitted over the weekend that several details in a column about internal White House strife over the president’s executive order on immigration were in dispute. A few days before that, WJBK-TV of Detroit walked back a report about a woman who died in Iraq supposedly after Mr. Trump’s new policy blocked her entry to the United States. Yet by the end of the weekend, it was Ms. Conway’s credibility that was receiving the most scrutiny (which she described as unfair and coming from “a lot of the haters” in her interview with Mr. Kurtz ). Some, like the New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen , were calling upon the television networks to stop booking her. And CNN declined to have her as a guest on Sunday — in part because the Trump administration offered her in lieu of Vice President Mike Pence, but also because of what the network told me were “serious questions about her credibility.” It would be a positive development if Ms. Conway embraced the idea that the term “honest mistakes” can apply to reporters, too, as it would be if everybody — including journalists — doubly committed to getting the facts right, without hysteria or misfires. Too optimistic? Well, if you had asked me a few days ago what I was planning to write about, I wouldn’t have said it would involve praising Twitter for keeping the national debate reality-based — and fun. Eventually, the Bowling Green memes led to mock street memorials with signs like “Never Remember.” They had made it IRL, or “In Real Life,” which, the new administration is learning, has a way of sneaking up on you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:54:41.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
