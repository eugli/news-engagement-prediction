Read on to see how you can harness the moon’s energy to change your life this month . . . WHAT IS AN ECLIPSE? Most months will bring one new moon and one full moon — with occasional exceptions. Eclipses are essentially supercharged new and full moons. Lunar eclipses occur during full moons, while solar eclipses occur during new moons. ARIES: Find a balance between what people (especially friends) need from you, versus what you need Eclipses are rare because they can only take place when the Sun, the Earth and the Moon are all aligned. They always happen in groups of two or three. A lunar eclipse happens when the Moon and the Sun are on exact opposite sides of Earth. These are important times for thinking about your life, whom you need to forgive or what you need to let go of and move on from. A solar eclipse happens when the Moon is between the Earth and the Sun. These are extremely powerful times for starting again and setting your intentions for the coming six months. Don’t waste them! FORGIVE AND FORGET ON FEBRUARY 11 Every single full moon brings a chance to forgive, let go and move on. You can forgive yourself and others, no matter how long ago they hurt you. The full moon is the time to release resentment, make amends, find peace and say sorry. The eclipse this Saturday is like the full moon on steroids, so it’s vital you don’t miss this opportunity. TAURUS: Chances are your family life needs extra emotional investment I find an effective approach for releasing resentment is to write down a person’s name along with what they did and then burn the paper. Doing this work at the time of the full moon sets you up perfectly for the next stage — the new moon eclipse when you can start to create your future. SET YOUR INTENTIONS ON FEBRUARY 26 At the time of a new moon eclipse, no matter what your sign, it’s time to begin something new, be it a romance, a job, or even a dietary regime. What you start at the time of the new moon eclipse on February 26 is likely to succeed. Note that this new moon eclipse heralds even more chances than usual for change, as the planet of sudden turnarounds, Uranus, will be highlighted. Happily, as lucky Jupiter is too, nearly all changes will be positive. The new moon eclipse is also the ideal time to make wishes and commitments, and to set your intentions for the following six months until the next new moon eclipse. Making new moon wishes could hardly be simpler. As close to just after the new moon as you can, compile a list of your top ten wishes, intentions and commitments. Ten is a manageable number. Once it’s done, read it out. Do keep the list to refer back to later. GEMINI: Rewards will start to come now. But don’t neglect your personal life THE ECLIPSES THROUGH THE ZODIAC SIGNS The four signs that will feel the February eclipses most strongly are Leo, Aquarius, Virgo and Pisces — as will the people who have those signs ‘rising’. Your rising sign is the most personal point on your chart, and is based on your time, date and place of birth. But whatever your sign, you will be affected. Here’s how . . . ARIES March 21 - April 20 Full Moon eclipse: This eclipse is likely to bring up intense feelings connected to a child (your own or someone else’s), a romance or a creative project. Also, find a balance between what people (especially friends) need from you, versus what you need. New Moon eclipse: If you’re feeling stressed, the eclipse in your cosmic zone can help you relax. Don’t let anxiety beat you. Connect with your spiritual side. Yoga, meditation or chanting could change your life in amazing ways. Also, it’s time to deal with a long-standing fear. CANCER: Work with the eclipse by believing in yourself and what you have to offer. Self-belief at this important time boosts your cash flow TAURUS April 21 - May 21 Full Moon eclipse: Expect a tug-of-war between your need for personal space and family time versus what you need to get done in your career. The eclipse is going to force you to confront this. Chances are your family life needs extra emotional investment. New Moon eclipse: Because the new moon eclipse is in your wishing zone, this is the prime time to make wishes and set your intentions. Make a list to read out on February 26, after 3pm (when the eclipse takes place in the UK). Visualise your desires. Dreams can come true. GEMINI May 22 - June 22 Full Moon eclipse: You may feel torn between where you are versus where you want to be.
