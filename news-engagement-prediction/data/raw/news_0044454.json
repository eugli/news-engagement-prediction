That actually saves money in the long run for the health system.” \nStefanovic was gobsmacked and insisted outraged viewers direct all complaints to Devine’s email address, encouraging to columnist to reveal it to Nine’s audience. Devine smiled and refused. \nThe News Corp columnist was immediately lambasted on social media by the public and her peers.
