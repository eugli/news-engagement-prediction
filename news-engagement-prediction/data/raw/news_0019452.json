Both Makonnen and the Migos trio are from Atlanta, Georgia. Related Migos' Wild World: One Night in the Studio With 'Bad and Boujee' Trio Syrup, $300,000 cars and \"magicianal\" rhymes: Up close with Atlanta rappers fans think are better than the Beatles \n\"We always been about being original and staying true,\" the joint statement began. \"Staying true to yourself goes a long way. We are all fans of Makonnen's music and we wish he didn't feel he ever had to hide himself. We feel the world is fucked up that people feel like they have to hide and we're asked to comment on someone's sexuality. We have no problem with anyone's sexual preference. We love all people, gay or straight and we apologize if we offended anyone.\" \nIn the interview, Migos praised Atlanta's \"diversity\" in the Atlanta scene before being presented with the recent news of Makonnen publicly coming out as gay on Twitter and the outpouring of public support. \"That's because the world is fucked up,\" Offset said after Quavo inquired about the support. \"The world is not right,\" Takeoff added. Quavo added in the interview that \"we ain't saying it's nothing wrong with the gays\" though suggested that his sexuality undermined Makonnen's history \"trapping and selling Molly.\" \nMakonnen has yet to comment on Migos statements about his sexuality. Two years ago, Migos hopped on a remix of iLoveMakonnen's song \" Whip It \" when both were beginning to gain traction with songs like \"Tuesday\" and \"Fight Night\" respectively. The rap trio recently released their album Culture , which is led by the Number One single \"Bad and Boujee.\" More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:02:54.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
