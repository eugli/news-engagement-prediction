Cheteshwar Pujara attempted to fend off a snorter but gloved it to the wicketkeeper for the easiest of catch. A delivery later, India captain Virat Kohli was sent back for a duck as he chased after a wide delivery to edge it the first slip fielder. At lunch India were 70/3, trailing Australia by 190 runs on Day 2 of the first Test in Pune.It took Ravi Ashwin five deliveries to get rid of Starc who continued his clean hitting spree as he carved the offspinner for a four off the second ball of the day. But his attempt to clean the boundary wasn't strong enough as he found the fielder at midwicket to be out caught for 61 with Australian being all out for 260 in their first dig.Likewise India, Australia also shared the new ball between a pacer (Starc) and spinner (Steve O'Keefe). But it was first change Josh Hazlewood who made the first impact, inducing an outside edge from Murali Vijay (10) that was caught by 'keeper Matthew Wade. Both Starc and Hazlewood found their rhythm early on, bowling a tight line and consistently landing the ball in areas that were enough to create doubts in the minds of India batsmen. When Starc returned for a second spell, he produced an excellent short delivery that climbed onto Pujara and the result was a catch to the wicketkeeper. His departure brought in-form Kohli but he lasted two deliveries after being out caught in the slips with Australians breaking into wild celebrations. KL Rahul showed intent and wasn't averse to hitting the big shots when on offer. With seven fours and a six off O'Keefe, he was unbeaten on 47 with Ajinkya Rahane (6*).
