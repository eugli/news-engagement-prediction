Johnson Published 5:51 p.m. ET Feb. 23, 2017 | Updated 1 hour ago 'Fiduciary rule' has new restrictions and unworkable requirements on financial advisers. In Washington. (Photo: Andrew Harrer, Bloomberg) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWe can all agree we need more Americans saving for retirement, and having access to good plans and sound investment advice will help accomplish that goal. \nHowever, the Labor Department’s well-intentioned, but poorly designed, fiduciary rule threatens both. It jeopardizes the retirement security of millions of Americans with new restrictions and unworkable requirements on financial advisers. In fact, some companies will decrease the number of investment products available by as much as 80% while others will raise account minimums. \nThe rule’s rushed compliance period, severe consequences and compliance burdens will make it difficult for small businesses to offer retirement plans. Those who need investment advice the most will find it harder and costlier to get. Moreover, the enforcement mechanism will encourage frivolous lawsuits. \nWe heard concerns from small businesses across the country that they are worried about this rule, and the impact it will have on their ability to offer retirement plans, attract and retain top talent, and grow. \nScott Spiro, president and CEO of a California small business, said of the rule, “In an era where the government should make my job as a small business owner easier, they are doing the exact opposite.” Protect savers from hidden fees: Our view \nRachel Doba, the owner of a growing business in Indiana, expressed concern that the rule would discourage her employees from saving for retirement by making it more expensive. \nPresident Trump recently asked for a review of this rule. This was a necessary first step in halting the rule’s implementation and calling for an evaluation of its true impact. \nWe have long supported a best interest standard that ensures investors get sound advice. However, this rule will deprive savers of the advice they need to achieve financial security in their golden years. Now, we stand ready to help create meaningful policy that will actually meet the needs of small business owners, employees and retirement savers. \nDavid Hirschmann is president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness. Randel K. Johnson is the chamber’s senior vice president of labor, immigration and employee benefits.
