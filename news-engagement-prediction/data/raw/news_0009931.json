But for those with long memories or grandmothers with a certain bent towards the traditional, this unlikely phrase will evoke yearning and nostalgic delight. \nBoiled, milk, and frosting — here's what it is, and why you really must master it. What Is Boiled Milk Frosting, and Why Is It Boiled? \nBoiled milk frosting was once the most popular frosting for red velvet and devil's food cakes. Unlike other butter-based frostings, boiled milk frosting is thickened by cooking together flour and milk until a thick, pudding-like mixture results, and later butter and sugar are beaten into the cooled milk base. \nThis frosting goes by several nicknames including roux frosting and ermine frosting, but the most telling might be its nickname of \" cloudburst frosting.\" \nBoiled milk frosting is stark white, unlike frosting heavily tinged by butter, and incredibly light in both texture and sweetness. It has a taste akin to traditional buttercream, with subtle cooked milk aftertaste. \nWhile I doubt many of us will be trading our now-traditional cream cheese frosting for boiled milk frosting regularly, it is a handy recipe to keep in your back pocket for a day you run low on butter or need a buttercream without eggs.

Try a cooked cream cheese icing: Extra-Creamy Cooked Cream Cheese Icing Making Boiled Milk Frosting \nBoiled milk frosting does need more time to make than your average butter and powdered sugar frosting or cream cheese icing. You must cook the flour and milk mixture at least an hour before making the frosting. Similarly to cooking a gravy, whisking the milk and flour together while they cook and thicken will prevent lumps (although don't worry about any lumps, as they will be whipped out later). Off the heat the flour and milk mixture need time to cool completely and thicken to a custard-like consistency. \nButter and sugar are beaten together until fluffy, before the cooked and cooled flour mixture is added, so the longest (and hardest) part of making this frosting is waiting for the milk mixture to cool. Other Names for Boiled Milk Frosting \nHeritage frosting, mock buttercream, ermine, cloudburst frosting, gravy frosting, roux frosting, and also cooked flour frosting, but they are all assembled the same way and result in a frosting somewhere between buttercream frosting and whipped cream. The Science of Boiled Milk Icing \nWhy is this icing so creamy and light? Unlike traditional buttercream, which relies on the proteins of egg whites to create a suspension between the sugar and butter, boiled milk frosting utilizes the starches and gluten from the flour to create structure for the butter and sugar. The whole milk also replaces some of the fat from the butter, so that boiled milk frosting requires less of it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:14:06.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
