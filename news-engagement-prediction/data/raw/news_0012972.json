There's just not sufficient shelter beds within the area,” says Sheila Palmer.\nSo many youth are forced to find a place on the street. Johnathan knows all too well what that means.\n“Before I came here I had to stay for a week just walking up and down Bayfield Street until McDonald’s opened in the morning so I could go somewhere warm.”\nWhile shelter managers want to offer more space, the challenge first is raising the money to do it; to make sure the future brings promise and hope to the many who need it.\nYouth Haven will get some help this year from the Coldest Night of the Year Walk. Donations from the event will support the shelter.\nPhotos Youth Haven is struggling to keep up with the demand of youth homelessness in Barrie, Ont. (K.C.
