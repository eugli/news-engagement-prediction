Picture: Hayley Browning/Facebook Rebecca Sullivan and Vanessa Brown news.com.au Share Share on Twitter \nTHREE weeks ago, Hayley Browning was diagnosed with breast cancer. \nFor years she’d listened diligently to advice from health experts and regularly checked her breasts for lumps. \nWomen are often told the best time to do a self-examination is in the shower, but Ms Browning, 27, discovered a lump in her breast while she was lying down. \n“I could only feel the lump while lying down and it completely disappeared standing up,” the UK woman wrote in a Facebook post, which has now gone viral. \n“Most websites tell you to check for lumps in the shower but if I had followed this advice, the lump may have grown too large to be treatable. Not even the surgeon could feel my lump when I was standing up.” \nMs Browning started the hashtag #LaidBackLumps and encouraged women to try her simple technique when checking their own breasts for lumps and bumps. \n“I’m hoping to share a little trick of mine with as many people as possible, which could potentially help save someone’s life. So, this is a call out to all women to check for lumps lying down, as well as standing up,” she wrote. \n“As I think about my long journey ahead and the chemotherapy I will undertake, I want to reach as many people with this message and help find more #LaidBackLumps.” Ms Browning’s Facebook post has been shared more than 60,000 times and received 46,000 ‘likes’.

It involves lying down with your arm behind your head and using the hand on your opposite side to check your arm pits, your breasts and around your clavicle,” Ms Aranda told news.com.au. \n“We always recommend a professional breast screening as it’s still the best chance of finding something.” The Essex woman is about to undergo chemotherapy.

Some lumps and bumps can be normal, especially before you get your period. \n“If you know what your breast feels like normally, you’re more likely to pick up those changes,” Ms Aranda said. \n“As the hormone levels change during your menstrual cycle, you can develop lumps. Some women have very lumpy breasts. Some are lumpy all the time, some are just lumpy during the menstrual cycle. If you know something about what feels normal for you, then you know what feels not so normal.” Picture: Supplied Source: Supplied \nAlso, lumps are not the only things women should be looking out for. \n“Not all lumps can be felt in the traditional way, because they can also appear as a thickening, as opposed to a large, defined lump,” Ms Aranda said. \n“There’s an effect called the Orange Peel Effect, which happens when the lump is pulling against the skin of your breast. You can get changes in the shape of your nipples ... they might invert. You can get leaking from the nipples, but if you’re not breastfeeding that’s not normal.” \nBreast cancer is the most common cancer in women in Australia and the second most common cancer to cause death in women, after lung cancer, according to the Cancer Council. \nThe majority of women with breast cancer are aged 50-69, according to 2012 data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, but it’s not unusual for women under 40 to be diagnosed. \nAn estimated one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer by age 85. In 2012, 15,050 women and 116 men were diagnosed with breast cancer in Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T09:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:06:40.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
