By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: February 21, 2017 8:42 AM Delhi Police has arrested one person in connection with the alleged rape of a 24-year-old woman from northeast in south Delhi’s Hauz Khas Village area.(Representative Image: Reuters) \nDelhi Police has arrested one person in connection with the alleged rape of a 24-year-old woman from northeast in south Delhi’s Hauz Khas Village area. Police had claimed to have identified the main accused in the case. Special Commissioner of Police (Southwest) and Delhi Police spokesperson Dependra Pathak said, “The main accused has been identified and further investigation is underway.” According to sources, there were two persons who were present there but only one of them raped the woman. Notably, one of the perpetrator is a minor. \nIt has been learned that, the two persons reside in a slum in Hauz Khas area. When police teams were sent to their residence today, they were not at their home, police said. However, police said they are likely to be arrested soon as 15 police teams are working on the case. \nYou may also like to watch \nPolice teams had been working on different leads based on CCTV footage and local intelligence and by questioning parking attendants, private security guards of the Deer Park and other shopkeepers in the locality. \nPolice also reconstructed the route allegedly taken by the accused person. \nThe incident took place on the night of February 18 when the woman, who belongs to Manipur, was returning from a party in Hauz Khas village along with her friends and cousins. \nThe woman told police that around 11.30 PM she was offered a drop home by an unknown person. \nHe apparently told her that his vehicle was parked at some distance near Deer Park. The accused, thereafter, on the pretext of guiding the woman, led her to an isolated stretch in the adjoining park area and allegedly raped her. \nThe woman somehow managed to escape from the spot and later informed the police. \nA case under IPC section 376 (rape) has been registered and efforts are being made to ascertain the identity of the accused with the help of local intelligence and electronic surveillance, said the officer. We have gathered vital clues in preliminary investigation and the accused will be nabbed soon, a senior police officer had said. “We are in touch with the woman, and she is being counselled to help her recover from the trauma,” the officer had said. \n(With agency inputs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:29:48.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
