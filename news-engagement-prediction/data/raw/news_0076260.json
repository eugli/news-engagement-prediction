In recent weeks, he has accused some news outlets of publishing \"fake news\". Barack Obama relentlessly mocked Trump during the 2011 dinner Credit: PA \nThe annual fundraiser for college scholarships mixes politicians, journalists and celebrities - and Trump himself has been mocked during previous dinners. \nIn 2011, Barack Obama poked fun at the Republican over his false claims that the then-president wasn't a US citizen. \nHe said: “I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald. \n“And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter — like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?” The White House Correspondents' Dinner mixes politicians, journalists and celebrities Credit: PA \nTrump has also slammed reporters for using anonymous sources. \nHis frustration includes reports describing contacts between his campaign advisers and Russian intelligence agents, which the White House has disputed.
