The actress played Sean Spicer , portraying the tense relationship between President Donald Trump’s White House press secretary and the media. “Before we begin, I know that myself and the press have gotten off to a rocky start,” Spicer began. “When I say ‘rocky start,’ I mean it in the sense of ‘Rocky’ the movie because I came out here to punch you.” “Now I’d like to begin today by apologizing on behalf of you to me for how you have treated me these last two weeks, and that apology is not accepted. Because I’m not here to be your buddy. I’m here to swallow gum and I’m here to take names,” he said, pouring a whole container of gum into his mouth. \"I'm here to swallow gum. And I'm here to take names.\" #SNL pic.twitter.com/bS6XdX1N7i \n— Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) February 5, 2017 Spicer then insisted that Trump received a standing ovation, “which lasted a full 15 minutes,” before announcing his Supreme Court pick. “The men all had erections. And every single one of the women was ovulating left and right,” he noted before accidentally reading aloud his email password. Spicer dismissed questions about the travel ban on citizens from Muslim-majority countries and Steve Bannon’s role on the National Security Council. He then lunged with his podium at a Wall Street Journal reporter who simply asked if he was okay, before threatening to lock her in a cage with a nearly-naked CNN journalist. \n— Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) February 5, 2017 He ended the press conference by shooting a reporter with a water gun for daring to ask about the White House’s statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day that didn’t mention Jews. McCarthy’s performance — which followed a cold open with Alec Baldwin as Trump and Mikey Day as Bannon — set Twitter abuzz, with viewers hailing McCarthy’s take on Spicer as Emmy worthy.
