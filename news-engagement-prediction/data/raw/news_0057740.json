Led by Union General William T. Sherman, the 135th served with some of the strongest troops in the Civil War. \n\"This particular regiment is comprised of men who followed Sherman from Georgia through South Carolina and into North Carolina,\" said Earl James, who works at the North Carolina Museum of History. \nThis infantry of U.S. Colored Troops was organized in Goldsboro with more than 200 black North Carolinians in the regiment. Though they didnâ€™t go into battle, they were vital to developing infrastructure for the Union. \nAt one point, the 135th built a bridge over the Neuse River so troops could travel over. \n\"That bridge is crucial because that Atlantic coastline railway is the main corridor of traffic, trade and transportation of eastern North Carolina into Wilmington,\" James said. \nUntil the recent rediscovery of records and photographs, the troops and their contributions had largely been forgotten. \n\"A lot of African-American history has been minimized and literally, thought the Jim Crow era, blotted from the pages of history,\" James said. \"So, we have to go back and rediscover it through the primary sources.\" \nWith the new information, researchers are hoping that even more people come forward with photographs and artifacts from their ancestors to finish telling the story in their own words. \nMuseum curators and researchers will present their all research Thursday at the Goldsboro Library.
