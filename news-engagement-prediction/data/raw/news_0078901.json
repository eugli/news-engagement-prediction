(AAP file image) \nSydney and parts of New South Wales will be welcomed into autumn with a week of persistent rain, meteorologists forecast. \nUp to 10mm of rain is expected to fall in the city each day for the next seven days, WeatherZone Senior Meteorologist Jacob Cronje told 9news.com.au. Current rainfall across Sydney. (WeatherZone radar) \n“On Friday and Saturday, it’s going to be even heavier… between 10mm and 20mm,” Mr Cronje said. \nhttps://twitter.com/BOM_NSW/status/835570537741058048 \nHe advised flood warnings would be likely for the mid-north coast, particularly in Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour. \nWhile the “healthy amount of rain” will settle the summer’s scorching temperatures, heat will be trapped by “persistent cloud cover”, Mr Cronje added. \n“It will stay in the mid to high 20s until at least Saturday.” \nEvenings will likely feel humid due to a combination of the rain and warmer temperatures. \nMr Cronje said the heavy rainfall was not “unusual” and was “common during the transition from season to season”. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T12:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:20:45.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
