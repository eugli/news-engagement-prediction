NC governor signs HB2 The letter from the NC Sports Association said 133 bids for NCAA championship events in the state have been submitted for the period between 2018 and 2022, with those bids alone representing at least $250 million in economic impact. \"What's more, in terms of youth and amateur sports in the United States, the NCAA exerts tremendous influence,\" the letter said. \"When the NCAA decides it will no longer conduct events in North Carolina, the Atlantic Coast Conference and many other sports organizations will surely follow. \"When compounding the effect of losing these additional sporting events, including hundreds of youth and amateur events, plus the NBA All-Star Game, we believe North Carolina could lose upwards of a half-billion dollars in economic impact.\" 'Nothing short of extortion' The NC Values Coalition, which favors HB2, criticized the NCAA. \"The NCAA's threats to pull games from North Carolina again is nothing short of extortion against the taxpayers and innocent fans who don't want to see sports politicized,\" the group said in a statement on its website . \"The NCAA continues to segregate athletes' teams by their genitalia, but they mandate nobody else may do the same.\" Gov.
