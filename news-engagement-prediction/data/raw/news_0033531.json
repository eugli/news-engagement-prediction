SHEA Rachel L. Lindsay, a 31-year-old lawyer from Texas, will be the first African-American lead on “The Bachelorette,” 14 years after the show, a spinoff of “The Bachelor,” debuted on television. The decision was announced Monday night on “ Jimmy Kimmel Live !” Ms. Lindsay, a contestant on the current season of “The Bachelor,” appeared on the Kimmel show to accept a rose from the host. “I’m ready to find love, find a husband,” she said, adding that she was looking for a partner who was ready to start a family.
