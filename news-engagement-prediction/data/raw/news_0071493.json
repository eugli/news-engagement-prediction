Asenjo, who has made 31 appearances in all competitions this season for Villarreal, will have to undergo surgery. The typical recovery time for a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament is around six months. The 27-year-old suffered his first ACL setback in 2010 while on the books of Atletico Madrid and tore it again a year later while on loan at Malaga. He ruptured his right ACL for the third time in April 2015 and is set for another long lay off in the wake of the defeat to Madrid. Sunday's result means sixth-placed Villarreal sit 16 points behind Madrid, who remain on course for a first La Liga title since 2012. The win at Villarreal means Real Madrid lead Barcelona by one point with a game in hand Share or comment on this article Most watched Sport videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:07:23.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
