That could include people arrested for shoplifting or minor traffic offences. \nThe memos eliminate far more narrow guidance issued under the Obama administration that resources strictly on immigrants who had been convicted of serious crimes, threats to national security and recent border crossers. \nSecretary Kelly’s memos also describe plans to enforce a longstanding but obscure provision of the US Immigration and Nationality Act that allows the government to send some people caught illegally crossing the Mexican border back to Mexico, regardless of where they are from. \nOne of the memos says that foreigners sent back to Mexico would wait for their US deportation proceedings to be complete. This would be used for people who aren’t considered a threat to cross the border illegally again, the memo said. \nThe memos, which provide guidance on the implementation of two executive orders signed by Mr Trump in January, do not change US immigration laws, but take a far harder line toward enforcement. TRUMP DENOUNCES ‘HATE, EVIL’ \nMr Trump on Tuesday denounced recent threats against Jewish community centres as “horrible ... painful” and said more must be done “to root out hate and prejudice and evil.” \nHe made the remarks after touring the newly-opened National Museum of African-American History and Culture with Housing and Urban Development nominee Dr Ben Carson and his daughter, Ivanka Trump. \n“This tour was a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms,” Mr Trump said. \nOn Monday, 11 Jewish community centres across the country received phoned-in bomb threats, according to the JCC Association of North America. Like three waves of similar calls in January, Monday’s threats proved to be hoaxes, the association said in a statement. \n“The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centres are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,” Mr Trump said. He did not outline what that might include. \nThe president’s comments marked the first time he had directly addressed recent incidents of anti-Semitism and followed a more general White House denouncement of “hatred and hate-motivated violence.” America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC — Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 20, 2017 \nOn Monday, Mr Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump wrote on Twitter, “We must protect our houses of worship & religious centres,” and used the hashtag (hash)JCC. She converted to Judaism ahead of her 2009 marriage to Jared Kushner. \nDuring the museum visit to mark black history month, Mr Trump “pledged” to do “everything I can” to protect the freedom of African Americans and praised Dr Carson, calling him a “great guy” a “a tremendous fighter for justice”. \nMr Trump vowed to “bring this divided country together,” and gloated about his “double-digit” election victory in South Carolina. media_camera US President Donald Trump and Dr Ben Carson tour he Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture in Washington, DC.

Picture: AFP/ Valery Hache \nOf Mr Trump, Clooney said: “(Trump) Collects $120,000 a year from his Screen Actors Guild pension fund. He is a Hollywood elitist.” \nThe 55-year-old also called out Mr Trump’s senior adviser: “Steve Bannon is a failed film writer and director. That the truth, that’s what he’s done. He wrote a Shakespearean rap musical about the LA riots that he couldn’t get made. He made a lot of money off of Seinfeld . He’s elitist Hollywood, I mean that’s the reality.” \nClooney called on journalists to continue to independently report on Mr Trump. \n“We have a demagogue in the White House. We need the fourth estate, which is journalists, to hold his feet to the fire,” he said. \n“They didn’t do a very good job during the campaign. And they haven’t done a particularly good job yet. But those things will change.” media_camera George Clooney says US President Donald Trump (left) and Stephen Bannon are “elitists”.

This will not defeat me.” He also said he was a sex abuse victim and devoted his career to “out” paedophiles. media_camera Milo Yiannopoulos’ book deal has been cancelled.

Picture: AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster TRUMP MYSTERIOUSLY DELETES TWEET \nMr Trump posted and then quickly deleted a tweet about meeting generals at “Southern White House” Mar-a-Lago on Monday. \nThe US President, who has just returned from his estate in Palm Beach, Florida, tweeted: “Meeting with Generals at Mar-a-Lago, Florida. Very interesting!” \nBut within a few hours, the post had disappeared from social media. \nSome legal experts say deleting tweets from official accounts is illegal, as the Presidential Records Act of 1978 states all presidential records must be preserved. media_camera ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:45:39.583+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
