There’s Malkah, Steve Price and Kris Smith, bickering in the foreground: It’s like Where’s Wally but with Jay Laga’aia. Source: Channel 10 \nSpot it? There in the background, sprawled out on his camp bed, serenely plucking his ukulele, is a certain Play School presenter: IT'S JAY! *X-Files theme plays* Source: Channel 10 \nWhile the scene was included in the episode to set up a larger conflict Malkah and Smith would go on to have, Laga’aia’s blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameo did confuse some viewers: @ImACelebrityAU how is that #celebJay is on the TV in tonight's show when he was voted out last Sunday pic.twitter.com/5RRTZzhoNZ — Trevor Gerdes (@trevorgerdes) February 21, 2017 @ImACelebrityAU just played footage of Tziporah and Kris arguing... But Jay was in the background? He got booted on Sunday? #ImACelebrityAU — Rowan Brookes (@RowanBrookes) February 21, 2017 Who's the bloke singing in the background of the darts game? Was that Jay??? #ImACelebrityAU — Anouska (@AnouskaHaaket) February 21, 2017 \nMoments later, Malkah and Smith’s fight continued as their campmates looked on — among them celebrity style guru Carson Kressley, who entered the show as an intruder the day after Laga’aia left: Moments later, the cameras cut to shots of Carson Kressley — who entered the show as Jay exited. Source: Channel 10 \nWe’ve approached Ten for comment about this surprise cameo, but in the meantime, it’s nice to think Jay is always out there, in some reality TV dimension, still entertaining / annoying his I’m A Celeb campmates with that damn ukulele.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:39:11.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
