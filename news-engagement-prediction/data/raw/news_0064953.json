(Morell Rink)\nMacFarlane sprang into action, and put visitor's dressing room one off-limits to all.\n\"We found a few old jerseys and made her a little bit of a bed,\" he said. \"I live two minutes away, and ran home and got her some cat food, and she's got some coffee creamers here in a couple of french fry trays.\"\nThe orange cat even got a temporary name: Gypsy.\nBut MacFarlane knew a rink was no place for a cat, even though they did find the wayward feline sliding around on the ice Tuesday.\nHe went to social media with a few photos, and word quickly got around town.\nCaregiver found Marie Eldershaw heard there was a mystery cat on Facebook.\n\"I went on, and sure enough, it was the orange cat I'd been feeding,\" she said. \"I just call him Tom. He'd been missing, and I just thought something had got him.\"\nTom was a stray that had shown up at Eldershaw's door.\nDressing room one was off-limits to other players. (Morell Rink)\nHe goes in and out for food, but is more feral than housebroken.\n\"He'll leave, he'll go away for the night and he'll be back in the morning,\" said Eldershaw. \"He gets up on my banister and looks in my window. And then I know that he's there and I just give him something to eat.\"\nEven though \"Tom\" has kept his wild ways, Eldershaw was concerned when he hadn't been around for a few days.\n\"I feel better, I feel relieved to know he's all right. Because I was kind of nervous.\"\nShe hopes to catch the cat at some point, and take him to the SPCA to be fixed.\nThat should solve the other mystery: MacFarlane was calling Gypsy a she, while Eldershaw said he's all Tom.\n$41M Province House restoration to begin amid questions about costs\nFrom cradle to controversy: N.B. minister wants some of P.E.I.'s glory\nFrom the interviews on Island Morning", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:49:02.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
