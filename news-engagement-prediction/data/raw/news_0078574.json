Ryan is also president of Local 915 of the Public Service Alliance of Canada.\n\"When you look at the emphasis on mental health in the workplace … I tell you, it's not easy not getting paid, and not knowing when you're going to get paid and not knowing if you're going to get paid next time.\"\nAccording to PSAC, the union has received many complaints from coast guard workers in Newfoundland and Labrador who have experienced issues with their pay. (Canadian Coast Guard)\nSince the pay system was introduced last February, more than 80,000 public servants have experienced issues with pay — about 30 per cent of the federal government's workforce.\nLiberals agree to emergency meeting Thursday over Phoenix payroll mess Phoenix pay system mess affects 80,000, government officials say Ryan said he's been both overpaid and underpaid. And while he's able to request salary advances — what he refers to as priority payments — there are issues with that process as well.\n\"I was at sea when I realized I hadn't been paid. Our internet system is terribly slow aboard ship and I couldn't download the forms to send back. I had to wait until I came in which delayed us even further,\" he said.\n'I've been several pay periods not getting paid.' - Bill Ryan And according to Ryan, government has been recouping those advances in full — leaving some employees without wages for months.\n\"They're not supposed to take back any more than 10 per cent of your pay [to repay an advance] … and they're supposed to work that out with you to make sure you can afford that much,\" Ryan said.\n\"That hasn't been the case for me at all. When I was overpaid, they were taking back 100 per cent. In my case, I've been several pay periods not getting paid.\"\nAccording to Ryan, even the information listed on his recent T4 tax slip is incorrect.\n'Absolutely bogus' Ryan doesn't believe the federal government has the number of payment problems down to 8,000 civil servants .\nMore than 80,000 public servants, about 30 per cent of the federal government's workforce, have experienced issues with their pay. (Canadian Press)\n\"Absolutely bogus,\" he said. \"That might be under 10,000 from when they started looking at it … but every pay period, it increases.\"\nOne colleague, he said, has been out of work since last June but, because they haven't been laid off, they're unable to apply for unemployment insurance.\n'We don't get paid enough to go without pay.' - Bill Ryan Another, he said, went on maternity leave last May but waited until January to receive benefits, including back pay.\n\"We don't get paid enough to go without pay. When you've got someone taking home 600 bucks a week, you can't afford to go without that pay. You've hardly got enough to scrape along. We're working on ratifying an agreement,\" he said.\n\"We're not going to work to get sympathy. We go to work and we provide valuable service.\n\"Everything from search and rescue to the people who send out the pension cheques, letting people in and out of the country — the border guards — the whole works, and we're not being appreciated,\" he said.\n\"You're going to work to get paid and feed your family, keep the lights on. And it's not easy when you don't know what's coming next.\"\nWith files from the St. John's Morning Show", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:45:10.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
