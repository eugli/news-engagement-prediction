That's 744 hours, approximately a quarter of which he has spent at t he Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, the Trump Organization's premiere Florida property. \nSince Trump was sworn in as President at noon on January 20th, Trump has spent slightly more than a third of his time working. \nThose estimates come from an analysis of pool reports conducted by The Washington Post . The Post categorized each of Trump's activities while he was officially working and estimated the amount of time he was either not working or asleep based on when the press pool was told to arrive in the morning and leave at night. Here's how President Trump has spent his first month in office: \nSkye Gould/Business Insider; The Washington Post \nIn total, Trump spent 6 hours attending intelligence briefings, 21 hours on foreign relations, 13 hours tweeting and 332 hours on other work-related activities. This includes everything from phone calls with foreign leaders (21 hours), time spent signing bills and executive orders (6 hours), news conferences (4 hours) and listening sessions (14 hours). \nAside from 26 hours spent traveling and visiting states like Pennsylvania and South Carolina , Trump divided his time between Washington and his Florida residence at Mar-A-Lago. \nTrump spent more than a quarter of his first month in office in Florida, playing golf for 25 hours, despite criticizing Obama in the past for spending too much time on the golf course. \nWhile The Washington Post's analysis did not differentiate between time Trump spent sleeping and regular downtime, Trump spent 424 hours on non-work activities. The average American adult (25-54, with children) spends 471 hours on non-working activities, according to data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics . \nFurther, Trump has said in the past that he sleeps between 3-5 hours per night . If one takes the high-end and assumes Trump receives approximately 5 hours of sleep per night (155 hours for the month), that leaves 269 hours (or a little over 11 days) of non-work activities.
