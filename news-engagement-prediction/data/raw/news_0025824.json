Updated February 14, 2017 \nThe Nasarawa State Governor, Tanko Al-Makura has given an assurance that in the next two years, the Lafia airport will be ready for operation. \nHe said the ongoing Lafia Airport, when completed will be the most viable alternative to the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport which is in Abuja. \n“With the commitment of the contractors, there is every assurance that in the next two years the airport will be ready for use”. \nThe governor affirmed that with the 65 kilometer road to be constructed from the Airport to Keffi, passengers from Abuja will be able to access the Airport within one hour ten minutes. \nHe explained that depending on the location of passengers in Abuja, the Lafia Airport will be closer to those around Karu, Asokoro and other locations in Abuja looking at the distance to the Abuja Airport and that of Lafia. \nHe further maintained that the airport will also open up more business channels and activities that will boost both the economy of the state, FCT and equally create employment opportunities for the people. \nHe added that the people of the state and business partners interested in the project should be rest assured that the Airport will be a reality.
