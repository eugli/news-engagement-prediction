It was a nuanced, soulful performance that stands out even on Ali’s considerable resume, which includes supporting turns in House of Cards , The Hunger Games series, Luke Cage , and many more.

I think that’s true with so many people, definitely with me. It’s an appendage. It’s a part of me.” \nIn an interview with Complex , he also discussed how he likes to make Spotify playlists for his characters. And now we really, really want to hear what he’s putting on the one for James Cameron and Robert Rodriguez’s Alita: Battle Angel . \nSubmit your Great Job, Internet tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:30:54.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
