Not all of the examples featured in our list sold, but the ones that did amounted to £248,105. Here are our favourites...\n1957 Lamborghini DLA 37 - sold for £12,720 Two Lamborghinis were available at the auction - a 1997 Diablo VT Roadster that sold for £174,400, and this 1937 DLA 35 tractor.\nThat's right, Lamborghini originally made agricultural vehicles before they ventured into the world of supercars. As any good car historian will tell you, Ferruccio Lamborghini was originally a tractor-maker and industrialist, who then turned his hands in the early 1960s to outlandish and beautiful sports cars to rival Ferrari.\nThis is one of 117 DLA 35 models built and is powered by Lamborghini's own engine. It's not a snarling V10 or thunderous V12, though. Instead, it's a modest three-cylinder 2.2-litre unit packing 36bhp. In short, it wouldn't win any drag races against an Aventador... unless it was through a field.\nRestored in 2016, the orange and blue livery is the factory colour - in fairness, we've seen plenty of more hideous paint schemes on Lambos around Knightsbridge.\n1994 Lancia Hyena - sold for £137,000 A big chunk of that quarter or a million pounds raised was made up by this car alone - but have you ever seen one before?\nCalled the Lancia Hyena, it's a coupe version of the Delta Integrale hatchback that dominated the World Rally Championship in the 1990s. Fiat (which owned Lancia at the time) refused to commission the Zagato-drawn car, so the design house had to purchase complete Delta Integrales - which came at a big expense - to recreate as these slick sports cars.\nJust 24 were made - this is number 15. It's also believed to be the only one finished in 'Verde Zagato' and has covered just 5,000 miles.\n2010 Fiat 500 Jollycar - sold for £29,400 Do you remember the 1950s Fiat 500 Ghia Jolly? You know, that beach-ready version of the Cinquecento with the roof sliced off and wicker seats chucked in?\nGuess what? Someone has tried to replicate it with a modern-era 500. Okay, it doesn't pull off the look as well as the iconic car it's based on, but you do get the same woven seats and a white and red striped sun shade.\nIt's no garden-shed mash-up either - to increase the stiffness of the body, the shell has been reinforced with laser-cut steel plates and steel tubes, as used in FIA-specification roll-bars for rally cars. The body has then been contoured by hand.\nHOW THIS IS MONEY CAN HELP Can you find cheaper car insurance?

This 308 GTB is one of the rare models manufactured with dry-sump lubrication and Weber carburettors, making it eligible for FIA Group 4 rallying back in the day.\nThat means it went head-to-head with the highly-strung Lancia Stratos and Porsche 911s of the same era, before Group B replaced the category. Recently restored and raced in historic events, the tuned V8 motor produces a respectable 297bhp.\nWho would have thought spotlamps would look so good on a Ferrari? That said, it was one of the cars that failed to sell at the Bonhams event.\n1968 APAL Horizon GT - sold for £25,400 'What the hell is that?', we hear you ask. Called an APAL - standing for Application Polyester Armé de Liège - it's a coupe inspired by the 1959 Porsche Carrera Abarth but built on a VW Beetle platform.\nThe Belgian car manufacturer made Just 150 models in its brief history, though it did compete in some racing and rallying events.\nThis is one of 10 Horizon GTs - APAL's last model - made. It's powered by a 1.7-litre VW motor producing 100bhp and comes with a full detachable roof panel that can be stored in the boot. It's never been road registered and has been fully restored.\nSuper-rare ride-ons for kids Okay, this pairing is a little off-piste, but still a worthy mention from the Bonhams sale.\nOn the left is a specially commissioned Mercedes SLR McLaren child's replica car that's powered by a 12-volt battery, capable of hitting a 4.5mph. What makes it a fitting member of our odd-ball list is the fact that it's been encrusted in Swarovski crystals. Someone paid £638 for it.\nOn the right is something a little more tasteful - a rare pedal-powered 1940s Jeep. It features a pressed steel body, stirrup pedals and a spare wheel and jerrycan strapped to the back. The ideal period toy, which sold for £861.\n1955 Renault 4CV 'Pie' - sold for £33,300 This is one of the modified Renault 4CVs used by the Paris Municipal Police in the 1950s that were adapted specially for on the beat procedures.\nFor instance, those cutaway windows allowed officers to use their firearms on the move and the engines were tuned to chase down getaway cars.\nFinished in black and white, they earned the name 'Pie', deriving from magpie.\nThis car is one of the first 15 4CVs delivered in 1955. After it was decommissioned it was kept in the same private ownership for 50 years by a dedicated collector - the car even came with 16 DVDs of feature films the 4CV 'Pie' appeared in.\n1971 CAP Scoiattolo - sold for £7,828 Even the auctioneer selling this car admitted he'd never seen one in his 33 years of wielding a miniature wooden mallet. Testament to just how rare it is.\nIt started life as a Fiat 500 but has been modified in a similar fashion to the beach 'Jolly' cars we've discussed above. This one is called the Scoiattolo - Italian for squirrel - and was created and registered by Carrozzeria Arrigo Perini (CAP).\nBonhams thinks this one was used for the publicity brochure, of which a copy was included with the car. Its party trick is that it can shed its doors completely, while the windscreen also folds flat for the maximum al-fresco driving experience. It has just 23,500 miles on the clock from new.\n1943 Ford GPA - not sold The final vehicle in our list is a Jeep-converted Ford GPA. This was an army vehicle designed during the second world war as the US needed a lightweight amphibious vehicle.\nOn land, the GPA could be driven with either two-wheel or four-wheel drive and was powered by Jeep's 2.2-litre side-valve engine. In the water, it had a screw propeller to guide it from shore to shore.\nSome 12,800 were made during production, which ended in 1943 when the military realised it was too slow and heavy on land and the low freeboard put it at risk of sinking in choppy waters. Brilliantly rubbish, then, which might explain why it didn't sell at the auction on Friday afternoon.\nSAVE MONEY ON MOTORING Car insurance Compare policies Warranties Get covered Breakdown cover Find the best deals Personal loans Borrow for a car Insurance tips Reduce your costs", "external_links": ["http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/car-insurance-finder", "http://live-uk.andweb.dmgt.net/money/cars/article-1640018/How-cheapest-car-insurance-Ten-tips-cheaper-car-cover.html", "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/loans-finder", "http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/breakdown-finder", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/car-insurance/?source=THISMO12", "http://www.thisismoneywarranties.co.uk/car-warranty.html"], "published": "2017-02-13T14:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:26:30.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
