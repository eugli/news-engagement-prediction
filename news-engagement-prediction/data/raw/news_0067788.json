Scroll down for video Match made in hell? Bachelorette bad boy Chad Johnson and The Bachelor's Corinne Olympios met at an OK Magazine pre-Oscar party on Wednesday night TV villains: The moment came just after Chad had revealed in a recent interview that the duo have been texting each other Corinne wore a silky off-the-shoulder dress and nude heels while Chad, 28, looked sharp in a grey suit and maroon tie. The duo chatted it up, sharing a giggle and looking animated as they finally got to compare notes about being the baddies on their respective seasons. During the night Chad shared an Instagram snap with the bubbly Miami-based blonde as well as Olivia Caridi, the 'villain' from Ben Higgins' season. 'We're just misunderstood Team Olichorinne @oliviacaridi @colympios' the burly real estate agent captioned the photo. Lots to talk about: The duo chatted it up at the Oscars & OK! Magazine party in Los Angeles Does this mean she's out? Corinne is still in the running to win Nick Viall's heart on the current season of The Bachelor airing every Monday Leggy look: The Miami-based ABC star arrived in a silky off-the-shoulder dress with nude heels Earlier the same day Chad confessed he's been texting Corrine - who is currently starring on Nick Viall's season of The Bachelor airing on Mondays - as the twosome bond over being labeled villains on the ABC franchise. During a chat with Entertainment Tonight the lunch meat lover seemed excited at the prospect of meeting Corinne. 'Yeah [I'm interested in Corinne],' Chad confessed. 'I mean, I don't know what she's like in person, but… we've texted a little bit. 'I knew that because she was the villain, nobody was really going to be talking to her. She was probably going through this all alone, and you think no matter how hard-headed you are… I knew people were probably just tearing her down, so I just wanted to let her know, like, \"Try not to look at it, let it pass. It will slow down,\" 'We're just misunderstood!' Chad shared a photo from the moment as he also met Olivia Caridi, the 'villain' from Ben Higgins' season Bad boy: The 28-year-old star looked sharp in a grey suit and maroon tie at the event at Nightingale Plaza Nervous? Chad mopped his brow as he smiled for photos on the red carpet 'She's good [now]. I think at first, she had the same emotion as me. She was like, \"No, I'm good. I got this,\" and then a couple weeks down the line, I think she texted me like, \"This is getting kind of tough,\"' he added. 'But yeah, she seems pretty cool… she obviously doesn't care at all what anybody thinks.' Chad admitted that he finds the show boring so hasn't been watching Corinne compete for Nick's affections. 'The only reason I wanted to watch it is to see what chicks I want to date' he added candidly. In another hint that Corinne might not end up engaged to Nick, Chad revealed that he's looking forward to seeing her on the upcoming Bachelor In Paradise season. In it to win it: Corrine got to the hometown dates with Nick Viall in this week's episode of The Bachelor Naughty: Corrine garnered a lot of attention this season thanks to her playful antics with Nick Memorable: The business owner became unpopular with the other contestants after she whipped her bikini top off in the first week Chad was kicked off the last series of BIP in the summer thanks to his drunken bad behaviour but revealed that he's promising to clean up his act now he's signed on for the upcoming show. '[I'd want to] have fun, but not too much fun,' he said. 'Try not to black out, try not to get kicked off. Do not scream at Chris Harrison, [and] watch out for the crabs. And actually try to get on a date with the girls I am interested in.' 'I have only drank twice this year… I don't want to do the blacking out thing anymore. [My] real estate career is tanked, it's gone. I guess people thought I was murder-y,' he explained. Trouble maker: Chad was kicked off Bachelor in Paradise after only a couple of days thanks to his drunken antics Up to no good: The lunch meat lover also came to blows with show host Chris Harrison Chad made throwaway threats about murdering fellow Bachelorette contestants and their families during his run on the show in August before his stint on Bachelor in Paradise. Meanwhile, Corinne's outrageous behaviour doesn't seem to have put off bachelor Nick as the petite blonde got through to the hometown stages this week. She was seen taking the software sales executive on a massive shopping spree and introducing him to her nanny Raquel. Not his biggest fan!
