Chicago's about to do something its never done in 146 years of record keeping: go the entire months of Jan & Feb with no snow on the ground. \n— NWS Chicago (@NWSChicago) February 26, 2017 \nEven farther north and west in Rockford, still no snow. Since weather records began in 1905, Rockford has never gone all of Jan & Feb with no snow on the ground. That's about to change this year. \n— NWS Chicago (@NWSChicago) February 26, 2017 \nHowever, fairly sizeable storms are still possible in March and April. Chicago & Rockford 1\" snowfall record droughts continue. Chances of 1\" snows decrease in Mar/Apr, but they aren't immune to big snowstorms! pic.twitter.com/LjeBD08Cmn \n— NWS Chicago (@NWSChicago) February 26, 2017 \nFebruary ranks as one of the warmest on record, as well. Based on the forecast for last few days of the month, Feb 2017 in #Chicago could go down as 3rd warmest & tied for least snowiest Feb ever! \n— NWS Chicago (@NWSChicago) February 26, 2017 \nEarlier in the month, Chicago set daily high temperature records on five days, and all of them broke the top 10 for warmest days ever for the month. We can officially close the books on the record February warmth that started a week ago.
