[Photo/VCG] \nBEIJING - Chinese State Councilor Yang Jiechi on Tuesday urged China and the United States to strengthen pragmatic cooperation in a bid to push forward bilateral relations. \nYang made the remarks during a phone call with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \nIn a phone conversation earlier this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his US counterpart Donald Trump reached consensus on safeguarding the foundations of China-US relations and promoting bilateral exchanges, paving the way for the next stage of development in China-US relations, Yang noted. \nChina hopes the two countries, following through on the spirit of the phone conversation, could uphold the principles of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation as well as enhance high-level exchanges, Yang said. \nHe also urged the two countries to properly manage sensitive issues. \nThe United States and China are important countries in the world, Tillerson said, adding that strong bilateral cooperation not only benefits both countries but also does good for regional and global peace, stability and prosperity. \nNoting that not long ago leaders from the two countries held important talks, Tillerson said the United States is willing to work with China to enhance mutual trust and develop ties. \nThe two sides also exchanged some views on a number of international issues.
