Susan Collins. \nMainers For Accountable Leadership is planning to hold rallies at 12:30 p.m. on Wednesday in Portland, Bangor and Lewiston. The group is referring to the rallies as \"open air town halls.\" \nThe group has charged recently that Collins, a Republican, has been difficult for members of the public to reach. It held a meeting with her on Tuesday that was livestreamed on Facebook. \nThe events on Wednesday will coincide with an appearance Collins is making on public radio in Bangor. \nCollins has been critical of some of President Donald Trump's actions. Some liberal voters are hopeful she will emerge as a Republican voice of dissent in the Senate. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press . All rights reserved.
