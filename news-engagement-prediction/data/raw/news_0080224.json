But Victory clearly are reluctant to lock themselves in to keeping him next season. \nEvery game of every round LIVE & ad-break free during play on FOX SPORTS.

That’s my belief. \n“But you still feel for Ben Khalfallah when you see him up in the stands — suited up and watching the game from the stands — it’s a pretty tough one for him to take as well. \n“So there’s obviously two sides to the story here but it’s not the first time it’s happened and it’s not the last time.” \nTHE PATCHY FORM THAT COULD HAVE JUSTIFIED FBK SNUB \nTo say Ben Khalfallah’s form has fluctuated would be accurate — in terms of both this year and his Victory career overall. \nThe winger burst onto the scene in 2014 and played a crucial role in Victory securing the Premiership/Championship double in the 2014/15 season. \nAfter reportedly being in heavy demand in the A-League — with Perth Glory reportedly particularly keen to secure his services — Ben Khalfallah signed a new two-year deal with Victory in April 2015.

Source: Getty Images \nThis year, his form suffered severely, with Ben Khalfallah well down on his best. \nOff the back of a horrendous performance as an attacking midfielder in the Victory’s Melbourne Derby drubbing, the Tunisian looked almost set to simply see out his contract at the club, with Mitch Austin preferred ahead of him on the wing. \nBut then came a masterful performance against Western Sydney, where Ben Khalfallah’s brilliance was on full show as he orchestrated a 3-0 home win. \nSince then, the winger has started all but one game, with the most recent Melbourne Derby on February 4 his latest appearance. \nNow, it appears it could be difficult to see the fan favourite front up in Victory colours again. \nA DIFFICULT SITUATION TO HANDLE \nRudan said the situation was especially difficult for Victory manager Kevin Muscat. \n“It’s definitely not an easy one from Kevin Muscat’s point of view,” Rudan said. \n“He’s clearly trying to do what’s best for his football club and that’s the job of a coach. \n“Now, unfortunately for a coach, you have to deal with 20-odd players in your squad and everybody is in a different situation. \n“It just so happens that Ben Khalfallah incident has come up and it’s a situation that it’s really hard to find any medium ground because someone’s going to be disappointed along the way. \n“So I feel for Ben Khalfallah if what has been discussed is true — if he’s being left out of the squad because it may trigger another year in his contract if he plays another game. I do feel for him. \n“But like I said, it’s not an easy one for Kevin Muscat, it really isn’t — or for any coach for that matter.” Besart Belisha, Fahid Ben Khalfallah and Marco Rojas celebrate a goal. Source: News Corp Australia \nRudan said he didn’t believe the club’s situation would affect the club’s mindset heading into finals. \n“Some players who are close to Ben Khalfallah could be affected by it, other players who are of a professional line understand that’s their line of work,” he said. \n“That’s your job, it’s like anything. \n“Being as professional a club as Melbourne Victory is, I think the message from Kevin would be to understand what the bigger picture here is. \n“Successful clubs, they never make it about one person, whether it be the coach or an individual player. It’s about the team and the team is always the most important. \n“Now I’m pretty sure that Kevin’s message would have been that it’s about the team and it’s about the collective and going forward, a decision’s been made and we just need to be professional. He as a coach and players as well and just get the job done.” \nWHAT IT MEANS GOING FORWARD \nIf Ben Khalfallah remains on the sidelines, it opens up an opportunity for young wingers Jai Ingham and Mitch Austin. \nIngham recently re-signed with Victory for the next two seasons, indicating he’s part of the club’s long-term plans, while Austin enjoyed an excellent start to the season before succumbing to injury and losing his spot to Ben Khalfallah.
