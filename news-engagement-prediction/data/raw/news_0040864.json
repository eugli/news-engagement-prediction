Reuters Previous Next Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, during a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has called for support of the international community to help relocate Myanmar Rohingya refugees to a remote island until repatriation. \nMerkel herself wanted to know about the matter from Hasina during the bilateral meeting Hotel Bayerischer Hof in Munich on Saturday, the PM's Press Secretary Ihsanul Karim told the media. \nHasina told her that Bangladesh gave shelter on humanitarian grounds to the Myanmar nationals who entered the country illegally. \n\"They were in bad condition after arriving in Bangladesh,\" Karim quoted Hasina as saying in the meeting. \nShe told Merkel that the huge number of Rohingya Muslims, almost half a million, including the newly arrived 69,000, have impacted the environment of the tourist hub of Cox's Bazar where they are staying in two registered refugee camps and several makeshift settlements. \nHasina said a place had been fixed for them and they will be kept at the place 'temporarily'. They will be given all sorts of facilities until repatriation to their own country, she added. \n\"She has sought the support of the international community for this,\" Karim said. \nThe remote Thengar Char island in the Bay of Bengal, where Bangladesh authorities plan to shift the Rohingya refugees, is not yet considered fit for human habitation. \nIt takes two hours to reach Thengar Char by boat from the nearest human habitation in the coastal district of Noakhali. \nThe Bangladesh Forest Department, however, says it can be readied for habitation within a short time with proper logistical support.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:23:21.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
