Slot to Florida State Links \nThe nation's No. 1 athlete Justin Watkins (Ocala, Fla/Vanguard) said he flipped his verbal commit from Florida State to Texas, as first-reported by 247Sports. \nWatkins is visiting Texas this weekend. He arrived this morning and will be in Austin, Texas throughout the weekend. \n\"The reason I'm choosing Texas is because the way they will be using me in their offense,\" Watkins said. \"From slot wide receiver to running back. The H guy is very important to their offense. I want to be that guy that stands out. I feel like this will be the school that would make me stand out the most. The coaches here are great. They all take the time to actually understand their kids and care for them.\" \nWatkins chose Texas over 23 other offers including LSU, Florida State, Florida, Miami and Kentucky. \nWatkins originally verbally committed to Florida State June 18, 2016. \nWatkins was once committed to LSU from April 30, 2105 to February 16, 2016. \nHe says this is it for his recruitment. \n\"I want to shut down my recruiting because I know this is the right place for me,\" Watkins said. \"I know it is. Their players get well taken care of. I believe coach ( Tom Herman ) will use me the right way.\" \nThe four-star recruit is ranked as the nationâ€™s No. 1 athlete in the 2018 class by 247SportsComposite and the No. 9 prospect in Florida. \nAs a junior, Watkins (5-11, 172) rushed 113 times for 1,122 yards with 18 touchdowns. \nHe also returned three kickoffs for touchdowns. \nAs a sophomore at Citra, Fla./North Marion, Watkins rushed 155 times for 1,350 yards with 14 touchdowns. \nHe also had 83 yards receiving and a touchdown and had 462 yards in kickoff returns with one touchdown. \nWatkins projects to play slot receiver in college, some all-purpose back and return punts and kickoffs given his 4.4 speed. \n\"I'm going to help them win games,\" Watkins said. \"I'm going to be that player that when I touch the ball the fans know I'm going for a touchdown.\" \nLonghorns running backs coach Stan Drayton is the recruiter of record. \n\"Coach Drayton was the guy that came actually to me and asked about my life,\" Watkins said. \"He asked all the important things. Not just my football life. He told me this place was the right spot. He wasn't lying. I'm looking forward to helping this program in any way I can.\" \nWatkins is an Under Armour All-American and earned an invite to The Opening last weekend in Orlando. \nWatkins is the first verbal commit in the 2018 class for Texas.
