This device almost certainly isn’t actually a full-fledged Samsung Galaxy S8, but a model created by accessory-makers. This 3D model – as we can safely assume it is – looks very much like the last several rendered images we’ve come across over the past week. With this new device, Samsung may break new ground by making no flat-screened smartphones in their main Galaxy S initial launch. \nWhat you’re seeing in the images above and directly below are photos of a smartphone with a screen protector on them. Much like we’ve seen in the past from leaksters like Venya Geskin , this device is not a final Galaxy S8, instead made specifically for case-makers. Whether or not the original specifications for the model were made by Samsung, we cannot say. \nWhat’s good about these photos is the sense that they give of scale with a human hand. Before now, we’ve mostly been relying on the goodness of renderings and our own estimations. Now we can see how big the device will be – and it’s not all that different from what we’ve experienced in the past. \nThe images shown above come from Twitter user Ice Universe . This user with a cat icon has been known to create 3D renderings of devices before – it would not be a surprise to see this happening again. Take these photos with a grain of salt. \nThe specifications for the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus shown below are not finalized. Instead, they are unofficial and based entirely on anonymous tips, rumors, and implied specs based on year-by-year upgrades. You can trust them only so far as you’d bet on them – which I certainly wouldn’t feel 100% safe in doing. \nSamsung Galaxy S8 • Display: 5.8in Super AMOLED, 1440 x 2650 (2K) Gorilla Glass • Operating System: Android 7.1 Nougat • Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 / Samsung Exynos 10-nm • RAM: 4GB RAM • Back Camera: 16MP, f/1.7 optics, 4K video, dual-LED flash • Front-facing camera: 8MP wide-angle lens with f/1.7 optics • Battery: 3,000mAh • Internal Storage: 64GB, 128, 256GB – w/256GB microSD card slot • Other Features: Fingerprint scanner, Metal frame, Wireless charging, USB-C \nSEE THIS: Galaxy S8 teaser video to appear this month \nAbove you’ll see specifications for the Galaxy S8 – before finalization by Samsung. They are not official. Just as it is with the specs above, so too are the specs below being posted by SlashGear before Samsung has confirmed the lot of them. \nSamsung Galaxy S8 (Plus) • Display: 6.2in Super AMOLED, 1440 x 2650 (2K) Gorilla Glass • Operating System: Android 7.1 Nougat • Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 / Samsung Exynos 10-nm • RAM: 4GB RAM • Camera: 16MP, f/1.7 optics, 4K video, dual-LED flash • Front-facing camera: 8MP wide-angle lens with f/1.7 optics • Battery: 3,500mAh • Internal Storage: 64GB, 128, 256GB – w/256GB microSD card slot • Other Features: Fingerprint scanner, Metal frame, Wireless charging, USB-C \nAs previously reported, it’s still seeming quite solid that Samsung would show the Galaxy S8 off in all its glory on the 29th of March, 2017. The first tiny preview of this device will likely come at Mobile World Congress 2017 during the reveal of (what’s very likely) the brand’s next tablet. Rumors suggest that the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus will then be launched sometime in April, likely on the 21st.
