I can’t say enough about him,” Wentz said when asked about the center on SportsRadio 94WIP. “He did a great job physically, but mentally he was just great for me to really bounce ideas off of. Him and I together were calling the protections and getting things dialed in. He was a really good guy for me to have, especially year one.” Related: Eagles may be considering moving on from Jason Kelce \nIt would’ve been shocking if Wentz had acted indifferent to wanting his center to return, but regardless his words do carry weight. Getting rid of the Kelce would likely have the biggest impact on the quarterback. \nSecond-year offensive lineman Isaac Seumalo would be Kelce’s replacement if the team does decide to move on from the veteran. The Eagles would save $3.8 million if they cut Kelce, but they would also have to pay $2.4 million in dead money. \nSeumalo was selected in the third round of the 2016 NFL Draft out of Oregon State. The rookie proved to be versatile in his first year, filling in at both guard and tackle at times during the season. Related: Doug Pederson has high praise for rookie Isaac Seumalo \nThough he has shown the ability to play several positions, his ideal fit with the Eagles is as their long-term center. Seumalo has the potential, but there’s a risk in getting rid of a veteran center — especially with a young quarterback at the helm. \nKelce isn’t an awful player, but his play has declined since signing a deal for six years $37.5 million in 2014. If the Pro Bowl center is still on the roster come next regular season, the Eagles could cut him in 2018 and pay only $1.2 million in dead money .
