(Photo: Rob Kinnan, USA TODAY Sports) \nWith the college basketball season taking center stage — ahem, football season is over and now it's rivalry week — the debate for top seeds and which teams are on and off the bubble will assuredly pick up. \nOne of the more interesting features of the latest early February bracket is how many teams the country's toughest conference, the ACC, is projected to send to the NCAAs. As of now, thanks to Syracuse's ascension, it's 10. Along with the Orange, the list includes North Carolina, Florida State, Louisville, Virginia, Duke, Notre Dame, Virginia Tech, Georgia Tech and Clemson. Essentially, all but two of the ACC's 15 teams have a shot. For point of reference, Clemson is 3-7 in the conference standings (12th place) and a projected tourney No. 9 seed. \nThat lists is excluding bubble team Wake Forest, the first team out as of now. It also excludes fringe teams Miami and N.C. State. \nThe most teams to ever reach the NCAA tournament was 11 in 2011 from the former Big East. While there's still five weeks to go until Selection Sunday, we could be looking at history in the making. \n► No. 1 seeds: Villanova, Gonzaga, Kansas, Baylor \n► Last four in: California, Kansas State, Seton Hall, Tennessee \n► First four out: Wake Forest, Rhode Island, Georgetown, Arkansas \n► Others considered for at-large bids (in no particular order): Illinois, Penn State, Pittsburgh, Providence, Nebraska, Stanford, Wichita State, Texas A&M, Houston, Memphis, Ohio State, Iowa, Ole Miss, Auburn, Alabama, Vanderbilt, Texas Tech, Miami, Charleston, Temple, Georgia, Utah, North Carolina State, Michigan. \n► No longer considered: UConn, Texas, UTA, Charleston, New Mexico, Boise State, LaSalle, Davidson, Chattanooga, Saint Bonaventure, Saint Joseph's, BYU, Oklahoma. \n► Multi-bid conferences: ACC (10), Big Ten (7), Big 12 (7), Big East (6), Pac-12 (5), SEC (4), A-10 (2), AAC - (2), WCC (2). \nMORE HOOPS NEWS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:57:10.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
