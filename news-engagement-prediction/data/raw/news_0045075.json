Watch Her Heartwarming Adoption Reveal Tanvier Peart \nTony King / Splash News \nAs a mother, I love to celebrate the happiness of fellow mommies, and I'm so overjoyed to hear that Hoda Kotb has adopted a baby girl named Haley Joy -- a child the Today anchor calls the love of her life. For fans of Hoda and Today , her news came as a pleasant surprise that left so many of us (including her colleagues) in tears. \nThe 52-year-old new and rightfully proud mom called in to the Today show where she shared this precious photo of her sweet girl who will grow up to call her mom. \n\"That little girl, Haley Joy, is my daughter!\" Hoda said to her coworkers as she fought back tears. \"She's a Valentine's baby so she's a little nugget.\" A post shared by Hoda Kotb (@hodakotb) on Feb 21, 2017 at 6:13am PST \nHoda's fellow anchors were thrilled to hear the good news (some already knew and kept it a secret), with many offering well-wishes. \n\"This little girl, Haley, is the luckiest girl on the planet,\" said Matt Lauer. \"You are going to be one of the most fantastic moms I can ever imagine.\" \nBut it was Hoda's Kathie Lee & Hoda costar, Kathie Lee Gifford, whose words to her friend and on-screen partner-in-crime gave me all the feels: \n\"You were made to be a mom.\" \nPass the tissues please. &mdash; TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 21, 2017 \nI don't know Hoda personally, but I am so so happy for her. Becoming a mother is one of the most beautiful joys and experiences of my life (my husband and I are just starting our journey to adopt to expand our family), and I can only imagine how Hoda feels with this beautiful baby girl. \nHoda's recent Instagram posts -- which were clues leading up to the mom's big reveal -- have been full of so much love and warmth that will continue to fill her heart forever.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:17:52.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
