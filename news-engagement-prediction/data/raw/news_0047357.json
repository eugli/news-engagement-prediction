He was sold to defending champions Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) for Rs 30 lakh. Nabi's teammate Rashid Khan fetched Rs 4 crore from SRH. \nNabi, who is ranked world No.4 in the ICC's all-rounders list for T20 Internationals, was ecstatic after making a major breakthrough. \nIn T20Is, off-spinner Nabi has so far pocketed 56 wickets at a decent economy rate of 6.96. \nNabi soon took to Twitter to express his \"happiness\" and he even praised teenager Rashid for joining the cash-rich T20 league. FLOODED WITH HAPPINESS TODAY NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF BUT RATHER FOR OUR JUNIOR ROCKING PLAYER #RASHIDARMAN BEING SELECTED FOR @SunRisers . @IPL â€” Mohammad Nabi (@MohammadNabi007) 20 February 2017 \nThe 18-year-old Rashid has played 21 T20 Internationals already and has snared 31 wickets. The leggie has an impressive economy rate of 6.14 which shows that he is extremely difficult to get away. David Warner, his skipper at SRH, should be thrilled with these two latest acquisitions.
