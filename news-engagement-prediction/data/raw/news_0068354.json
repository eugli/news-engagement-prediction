And no, it’s not about his music. The controversial singer is making headlines after his ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran filed a restraining order against him. \nAccording to TMZ , Karrueche claimed that Breezy “vowed to kill her” and that he’s beaten her up before. \nAccording to a sworn statement by Karrueche, Chris also apparently told a few people he was going to kill her, and he also allegedly threatened to shoot her. \nThe socialite also revealed that the award-winning singer punched her in the stomach twice, and pushed her down the stairs. Chris reportedly also told friends that he couldn’t have Karrueche, no one could. \nThis is not the first time the singer is in the news for abuse. Back in 2009, Chris made international headlines after beating up his then girlfriend, singer Rihanna. \nA judge has ordered Chris to stay 100 metres away from Karrueche. He was also told not to try to contact her. \nWhile some people have expressed sympathy towards Karrueche, others don’t believe her claims. However, her former neighbour has come out to defend her. In a series of tweets, Twitter user @KayCola supported Karrueche, claiming that she’s heard Chris beating her up. Some of y’all make me sick to my stomach talking about. Karrueches lying. I’ve heard him beating her myself. I even called the police: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:51:03.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
