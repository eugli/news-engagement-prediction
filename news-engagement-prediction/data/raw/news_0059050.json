Strikes: Queues for buses at Leytonstone (Jeremy Selwyn) \nSouthern Rail mainline services, carrying 300,000 plus passengers a day, suffered cancellations and delays because of a 24-hour walkout – the 29th strike – by train guards in the long running dispute over driver-only operation (DOO.) What you need to know about this week's Tube strike \nThe company reported disruption to all 10 line groups including the Brighton line and Gatwick Express. \nSouthern commuters changing to South West Trains services arriving at Waterloo were then hit by the strike on the Waterloo & City line. \nThere were no trains at all on some routes including those between Clapham Junction and Milton Keynes Central via Kensington Olympia/Watford Junction. Some services between Eastbourne and Brighton and London Bridge were cancelled. \nOn the Tube stations serving other lines were much busier than usual as commuters sought alternative routes to and from work. \nDisruption: Large crowds formed at Ilford (ITV London) \nThe situation was not expected to improve – on either the Tube or Southern - during the day with passengers facing the same problems getting home again in the evening. \nThere were huge queues outside many stations including Chingford, Ilford and Leytonstone. \nThe Victoria line was also much busier than usual particularly at Walthamstow Central along with the Jubilee line between London Bridge and Waterloo. \nThe Tube dispute is over the “forced” transfer of eight drivers from their home depot at Leytonstone to others further afield, mainly Earl’s Court. Unions announce fresh 24-hour Tube strike on Central line - 15.02.17 \nA new row broke over the transfer as London Underground (LU) said it was entitled to move the drivers under a “mobility clause” in their contracts, seen by the Evening Standard. \nThat states: “Your normal working location will be Leytonstone Train Crew depot Central Line. \n“LU will endeavour to allocate you to an operating location convenient to you but reserves the right to require you to work at any place it may from time to time determine within the area served by LU and London Buses.” \nPeter McNaught, Operations Director for the Central line, said: “I apologise to customers for the disruption that this unnecessary strike is causing. \n“We have made all reasonable efforts to resolve this dispute through talking through the issues with the unions, and we have minimised the number of employees affected from over 30 to eight. Strike action: The Central line will have no service east of Leytonstone (Transport for London) \n“All of these moves are within the long-standing agreements we have made with the unions. We call on the RMT to honour this long-standing agreement ‎and join us for more talks to resolve this issue.” \nAn RMT spokesman countered: “LU has made absolutely no effort at all to allocate drivers to their home depot. That is the point of the argument – they are just pushing people across the network without agreement.” Read more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:11:31.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
