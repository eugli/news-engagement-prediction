Manchester United and Manchester City should announce their tour plans next month, with their derby not yet confirmed. That depends on schedules, with City likely to spend some time in the Midwest - where 109,000 crammed into the Michigan Stadium to watch United take on Real Madrid in 2014. United are thought to be heading for the west coast. Pep Guardiola's team were due to meet United in Beijing in 2016, before it was cancelled City travelled to Abu Dhabi immediately after Tuesday night’s breathless 5-3 Champions League victory over Monaco. Guardiola’s opted to go away for warm-weather training given they have no game this weekend, while Yaya Toure claims City need to score twice in France to progress against the Ligue 1 leaders next month. ‘We need to score two goals and we have to be careful,’ Toure said. ‘The tie is not finished yet, still we have a game to play away at Monaco. ‘We have to not underestimate them, and try to score goals again.

Guardiola's side won the only Premier League meeting between the two this season, 2-1 RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:45:52.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
