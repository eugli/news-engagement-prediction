IDF special forces units and armored brigades also took part in the drills, in which the Navy, Airforce and Home Front Command also participated. \nIn addition to repelling Hamas commandos’ infiltration, the Israeli soldiers also practiced rescue and response scenarios to rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip, which have become an everyday reality for the Israelis living in the south of the country. \n“The Gaza Division exercise was an excellent opportunity to strengthen the preparedness of both active duty and reserve battalions,” Gaza Division commander Brig. Gen. Yehuda Fuchs was quoted as saying by the Jerusalem Post. \nThe IDF said the exercise was planned ahead of time as part of 2017 training programs.
