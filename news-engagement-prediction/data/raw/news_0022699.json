Masked rapper MF DOOM led the tributes to Dilla, posting a video to his official Facebook account titled “Happy Birthday Brother.” \nDOOM appearances have been a rarity these days, making his message all the more poignant. Speaking to camera, Doom said: “Dilla, Dilla. Shout out to my man J Dilla, moment of silence.” The brief video ends just seconds later. \nThe clip picked up 325,000 views in less than 24 hours. \nThe rapper wasn’t alone in his tribute to the legend. J. Rocc and Common were among the many others who also took to Twitter to share their love for the man. It's the Birthday of J.Dilla today. Please play some of his music.
