Patrick Ewing defends Michael Jordan (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 1:12 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 1:12 p.m. ET \nFor all you kids out there, long before Michael Jordan became a crying meme across the internet, he was a professional basketball player. And he was actually pretty good! \nFriday marked Jordan's 54th birthday, and what better way to celebrate than to watch Jordan light up the Knicks for 54 points in Game 4 of the 1993 Eastern Conference finals. (Sorry, MJ. We don't have any cake.) \nPHOTOS: A look back at MJ's incredible career \nThe Knicks held a 2-1 series lead over Jordan's Bulls heading into Game 4. Jordan had struggled from the field up to that point, shooting less than 50 percent in each of the first three games, including a 3-of-18 performance in Chicago's Game 3 victory. \nThat all changed when Jordan came out firing in Game 4, scoring 17 points in the first quarter alone. He put up his 54 points in just about every way possible: 18 of 30 from the field, 6 of 9 from 3-point range and 12 of 14 from the free-throw line. \n\"He just flat out kicked my butt today, simple as that,\" said Knicks guard John Starks (via The New York Times ), who had the unenviable task of trying to slow Jordan down. \"He was knocking down his jump shots. He was hitting his threes. I was right there with him, but he was on target today.\" \nChicago went on to win Games 5 and 6 to advance to the NBA Finals. The Bulls then took down Charles Barkley and the Suns 4-2 for Jordan's first three-peat with the franchise. \nHappy birthday to \"His Airness,\" and apologies to Starks for revisiting a dark place from your past.
