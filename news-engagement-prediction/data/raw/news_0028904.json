See you soon @jimmykimmel!\" Going to perform my new song #IDont on Jimmy Kimmel live on Wednesday! See you soon @jimmykimmel ! -- pic.twitter.com/kHQQDVBQ6A — Mariah Carey (@MariahCarey) February 13, 2017 \nCarey recorded \"I Don't\" in the wake of her split from fiancé James Packer and teased the Jermaine Dupri - produced the song during last month's finale of the E! docuseries Mariah's World. \nCollaborator YG was “very focused in the studio,” Carey recently told Billboard. “He wrote his rhyme and then out of nowhere, he came up with the \"I know you love me\" part and I loved that [singing] section. I feel like he was a perfect collaboration because he really focuses on what he's doing.” \nJust six weeks ago, Carey was shaking off a New Year’s shocker. The singer’s three-song set began promising enough with “Auld Lang Syne,” but went downhill with “Emotion” and “We Belong Together.” Carey claimed during the latter that she couldn’t hear through her monitors. The situation quickly devolved in front of 1 million revelers and a worldwide television audience on ABC. \nDon’t expect a repeat calamity when Carey appears on Kimmel’s late night talkshow. Though anything is possible. The last time she appeared on the show, Carey agreed to join Kimmel for an intimate interview ….in a bubble bath.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:15:41.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
