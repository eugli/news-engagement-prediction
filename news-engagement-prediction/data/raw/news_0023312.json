This is Vijay's ninth Test hundred 2 This is his third hundred in six games 3 He and Pujara scored 178 runs for the second wicket \nMurali Vijay smashed his third hundred in six Tests as India reached a daunting 223/2 vs Bangladesh after opting to bat in Hyderabad. \nVijay brought up his ninth hundred off 141 balls and his knock was studded with 11 boundaries and a six. He was eventually dismissed for 108 by Taijul Islam. \nThe 32-year-old had missed out in his hometown Chennai. Vijay was forced to come down the order after a huge partnership between Lokesh Rahul and Karun Nair. The local boy was out for 29. \nHowever, in Hyderabad, Vijay made amends and shifted gears brilliantly after a testing spell from Bangladesh's seamers on a pitch that had a fair covering of grass. India were reduced to 2/1 in the first over after Taskin Ahmed removed Lokesh Rahul in the first over of the match. \nBut thereafter, Vijay and Cheteshwar Pujara settled down to grind the Bangladesh attack. Their spinners failed to breakthrough and everytime they managed to bowl a few tight overs, Vijay would break the shackles. \nIn one such over, Vijay took on Shakib al Hasan and hit a four and six off successive balls to push the visitors further on the backfoot. \nThis has been a fruitful home season for Vijay. He had hammered two hundreds against England (126 in Rajkot and 136 in Mumbai). This is his third of the season.
