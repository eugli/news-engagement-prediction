And today we attacked again. I can say that 85-90 percent of the city is under control,\" another fighter from the Sultan Murad Brigade told Reuters by telephone, adding that some suicide bombers are still entrenched in the tunnels below the town, “every meter” of which is mined. \nField commanders from two other rebel factions in the town also told AFP that the town was successfully retaken from Islamic State. \"Yesterday [on Wednesday], we captured the city center, which was an Islamic State security zone... The jihadists collapsed, and this morning around 06:00 (local time) (04:00 GMT) we completed the operation,\" Saif Abu Bakr, who heads the Al-Hamza rebel group, told AFP. \nAnother rebel field commander, Abu Jaafar, told the agency that “dozens of Islamic State fighters were killed and we evacuated more than 50 families from … Al-Bab.” He added that he expected the cleaning up operations to be wrapped up within hours.

However, Reuters reported at the time that the terrorists were still in control of 90 percent of the town. \nEarlier, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed that the Turkish forces would continue their advance to Islamic State’s Syrian capital, Raqqa, once they seize Al-Bab. “The ultimate goal is to cleanse a 5,000-square-kilometer area,” Erdogan told the news conference at that time, as cited by Reuters. \nAl-Bab was the last of Islamic State’s major strongholds in the northern part of Syria, although the terrorist group still controls a number of small villages and towns in the area. \nThe Turkish offensive on Al-Bab is part of Turkey’s Operation Euphrates Shield, which started in northern Syria on August 24, 2016. According to AFP, it has become the bloodiest battle for Turkey since the launch of the operation, as 69 Turkish soldiers were killed there. \nAnkara deployed ground and air forces to Syria with the stated goal of retaking areas held by Islamic State and securing its southern borders. Turkish forces also engaged in fighting against the Kurdish YPG militia, however, with some critics claiming that suppressing Kurdish enclaves in Syria was the true goal of the operation. \nIn late December 2016, the Turkish military said that 1,294 Islamic State militants had been “neutralized” during the operation, in its fifth month at the time, with 1,171 of them killed. They also said Turkish forces “neutralized” 306 Kurdish YPG fighters, killing 291 of them, the ministry added.
