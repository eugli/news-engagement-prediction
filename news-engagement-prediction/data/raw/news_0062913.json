Alok Madasani, 32, and Ian Grillot, 24, were hospitalized and are in stable condition, they said. Witnesses said Grillot had stepped in and tried to stop the shooter. The LinkedIn accounts for Kuchibhotla and Madasani say that they were engineers working at GPS maker Garmin and had studied in India. \nLocal, county, state and federal law enforcement authorities attended the news conference where the murder charges were announced. \nAsked if the presence of federal authorities indicated the shooting could be considered a hate crime, FBI special agent Eric Jackson said it was too early to determine.
