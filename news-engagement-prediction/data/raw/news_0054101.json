Around a nearby, cold, small star we found 7 rocky Earth-size planets, all of which could have liquid water – key to life as we know it. pic.twitter.com/C2JWjDfBdK \n— NASA (@NASA) February 22, 2017 \nHe says 40 light-years is much farther than any technology we have to travel — but what it could mean is that if we sent a radio signal to them, it would take 40 years for that signal to get there. \n“One of the big questions that we have — are we alone in this universe, is there life out there, and the exciting thing for scientists is that this solar system that’s been discovered – is going to be easy for us to kind of observe that place and perhaps find out if there is other life there,” added French. \nAnd it could prove life on other planets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:07:55.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
