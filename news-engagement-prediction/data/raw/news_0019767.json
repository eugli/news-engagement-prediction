He was 87. \nFamily spokesman Doug Kuiper says Ilitch died Friday at a hospital. \nIlitch and his wife opened their first Little Caesars restaurant in suburban Detroit in 1959, and the business eventually grew into the world’s largest carry-out pizza chain. \nIlitch paid a reported $8 million for the Detroit Red Wings 1982, and the team won at least four championships under his ownership. \nA decade later, Ilitch paid $85 million for the Detroit Tigers and began pumping money into player salaries. The Tigers advanced to the World Series in 2006, but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals.
