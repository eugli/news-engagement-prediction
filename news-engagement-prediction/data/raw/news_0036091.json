Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \n\"I'll probably be carried out of here in a pine box,\" he told the Senate on Thursday. And if he does eventually retire he has no intention of getting on a plane again. \nHe says the government's legislation - which he is seeking to amend to take out all retrospective elements - is all about appeasing the \"lying commentariat\" and populist hysteria. Advertisement \n\"The shock jocks and the lazy journalists and sub-editors churn out the populist line because it's easy to do so, it always gets an energetic response from a small section of the community,\" he said. \nThe backbencher - who earns $200,000 a year - wants to know where the entitlements witchhunt will end. \n\"It won't be long before trips by ministers to Europe and America are called into question,\" he said, suggesting they may have to start travelling economy class. \nThen people might come after their Comcar limos: \"Populism will decree that they should go too and politicians should take a bus or a taxi without any thought for security. \n\"And instead of the big flash offices in the electorate perhaps politicians should just meet constituents in the privacy of the own home? \n\"And if we're to follow the populist approach, why bother with those hated, money-grabbing, self-serving politicians at all? \n\"Perhaps Hitler, Stalin and Idi Amin had the right idea - don't bother about a Parliament and you don't have to bother about those pesky parliamentarians at all.\" \nThe Life Gold Pass once offered former MPs unlimited travel at taxpayers' expense. Changes in 2002 limited that to 25 return flights a year and further changes in 2012 limited it to 10 return flights. \nThe Gillard government scrapped it for any MPs elected after 2012. \nUnder Mr Turnbull's plan, it will now be fully abolished for all but former prime ministers and their spouses. Mr Turnbull says he will not use it. \nSenator Macdonald says if the pass is scrapped, former prime minister's should lose it as well. They are currently exempt from the changes. \nâ€‹\"I can't fathom the logic behind allowing Julia Gillard - perhaps Australia's worst PM for a three-year term - to have a Gold Pass for the rest of her life while someone like Peter Costello - who did magnificent work for 13 years - is banned.\" \nDebate on the bill continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T05:01:19.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
