defends his Southland Strokeplay Championships title SCOTT DONALDSON Last updated 17:00, February 6 2017 John Hawkins/Fairfax NZ \nSouthland representative lawn bowler and golfer Matt Tautari won the Southland Strokeplay Championships golf tournament in Invercargill on Sunday, but had his bowls rained off on Waitangi Day. \nSouthland's Matt Tautari has been focussing on lawn bowls recently, but that didn't stop him from defending his Southland Strokeplay Championships golf title on Sunday. \nThe 30-year-old who has played representative golf since he was 15, has recently been selected in the Southland development lawn bowls team, but he still entered the 2017 Southland Strokeplay golf tournament at the Invercargill Golf Club in Otatara. \n\"I haven't picked up my sticks all year, this is my first tournament, I am actually playing a lot of lawn bowls at the moment, so I am sort of concentrating on that, so I just dusted the clubs off this weekend to try and defend the title,\" he said. \n\"Having the past winner there is usually a pretty good look and I managed to just get round, I have pretty good course management, I know my way around the course and I managed to just get the job done.\" \n\"It's not a great big field, but it still means a lot to us that play in Southland, to win that title.\" \nHe switched codes a year ago to see how far he could go in another sport. \nTautari thinks his expertise on the country's golf greens has helped him make a smoother transition. \n\"Yeah a little bit, I made the transition easier with feel, golf has a lot of feel and bowls is a lot of feel as well,\" he said. \n\"Just picking a line and transition from putting on the greens and picking a line and getting the weight right, is pretty much identical to bowls.\" Ad Feedback \nThe experienced Southland golfer finished with a nine-over-par 297 on Sunday to record a thrilling one-stroke victory, as windy weather made conditions difficult for the golfers. \nTautari struggled early on in the tournament, carding a first round six-over-par 78, to sit behind Central Otago teenager Inia Logan up until the final round. \nThe Southland dual code representative shot an impressive 69 in his second round and backed it up with rounds of 74 and 76 on Sunday, to pip Logan for the second year in a row. \n\"It was quite close in the end, I was trailing pretty much the whole tournament, I was eight behind after the first round, then I had a pretty good round on the Saturday afternoon to get back within one and then stayed one behind going into the final round,\" he said. \nThe golf was close throughout the whole final round, with the top five golfers finishing within five strokes. \nTautari kept a cool head as his rival Logan bogeyed the 17th hole. \n\"I went one up to play the last and I managed to hold on down the last for a par,\" he said. \n\"It was pretty intense, it was a grind-fest, it was pretty tough conditions, the course was playing extremely hard, it was really windy, it was just who could grind the hardest.\" \nThe Northend Bowling Club member has been selected to play bowls for the Southland development team for players who have played the sport for less than eight years, but he still enjoys playing golf. \nHe has played in 14 national interprovincial tournaments in-a-row since the age of 15 and is aiming to become the youngest person to play 100 interprovincial golf matches later this year. \nLogan was second at the Southland Strokeplay with a combined score of 298, while Oamaru's Jonathan Mackay finished third, ahead of Southland golfers Tyler McLean, Scott Hellier and Jeremy Hall. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:17:57.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
