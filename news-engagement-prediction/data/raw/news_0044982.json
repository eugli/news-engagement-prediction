The box contains a warning that reads, “Alert!” which is punctuated by an image resembling Trump’s signature haircut.\nShoppers can send directly through the extension a tweet to the company asking it to stop selling the items. DoneGood will also recommend to consumers similar websites that don’t have merchandise bearing the president’s name, and are “doing good for people and the planet,” said Cullen Schwarz, DoneGood’s co-founder.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. “If you’re boycotting a Trump business, but then still doing business with a company that makes their products in an overseas sweatshop somewhere, are the folks who are boycotting Trump really helping to create the world that they want to see?” said Schwarz.\nThe company’s politically motivated project mirrors the #grabyourwallet campaign , a financial protest of Trump’s businesses and products that was born on social media prior to the election.\nSome have argued that such protests are ineffective in the long term, and can affect workers rather than a company’s bottom line.\nAdvertisement\nSchwarz, a former press secretary for the Department of Agriculture, said when the company first launched, it had no plans to enter the political battlefield. But as users continued to rely on recommendations generated through DoneGood’s Chrome extension, they asked for a way to also pinpoint companies those selling Trump products, Schwarz said.\n“We were focused on issues like higher worker pay, and environmental sustainability,” said Schwarz. “We ... believe that the president's agenda does stand in opposition to the core ideals on which DoneGood was founded.”\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .
