The manufacturing giant, which is responsible for producing Apple’s iPhone among many other tech products, has agreed to buy a majority 54.5 percent stake in SoftBank Asia Capital in exchange for $600 million, according to a filing . \nThe deal is scheduled to go through March 1, after which time SoftBank Asia Capital will no longer be a SoftBank affiliate. A SoftBank representative confirmed that the agreement will see Foxconn become “the decision maker on investments” for the fund. \nFoxconn itself said the fund would blend “SoftBank’s investment expertise” with its “leadership in advanced manufacturing and technology services” and global presence. \n“The establishment of this joint venture is in line with Foxconn’s overall investment strategy and will enable the company to explore and tap new investment opportunities that will drive Foxconn’s sustainable business development,” the firm said in a statement provided to TechCrunch.
