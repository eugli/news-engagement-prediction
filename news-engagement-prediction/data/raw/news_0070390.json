REUTERS/Chris Helgren \nSince the presidential election, retailers that are being targeted by an anti-Trump boycott have dropped 3,600 Trump-branded products. \nThat represents a 61% drop in products since November 23. \nThe data is according to Shannon Coulter, a brand strategist who co-founded the #GrabYourWallet campaign in October. \nThe movement has called on consumers to boycott retailers that sell Trump-branded products. \nEarlier this month, Nordstrom, which was a target of the campaign, dropped Ivanka Trump's line of women's clothing, shoes, and handbags, citing poor sales. \n\"Each year we cut about 10% [of brands carried] and refresh our assortment with about the same amount,\" Nordstrom   \"In this case, based on the brand's performance we've decided not to buy it for this season.\" \nNeiman Marcus and Belk also stopped selling Ivanka Trump's products online. Sears' and Kmarts' websites stopped selling products from the Trump Home line. \nAt the start of the movement, Coulter made a list of the companies selling Trump products and contacted companies letting them know how to get off the list. So far, 19 companies have been removed from her list. \n\"I did expect it to succeed,\" Coulter   \"I saw such a strong and spirited response to even my very first musings about it.\" \nShannon Coulter/Grab Your Wallet \nCoulter's data doesn't include Trump items that are sold at brick-and-mortar stores. A number of retailers, including Burlington Coat Factory, Marshalls, and Saks off Fifth, have removed Trump products online but still sell them in stores.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:53:39.469+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
