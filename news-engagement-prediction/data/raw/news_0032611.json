Mumbai: The much hyped party song from to-release romcom ‘Badrinath Ki Dulhania’ is out and everyone seems to be going gaga over it. But, the revamped version of this 90s classic has left one person rather upset- choreographer of the original song featuring Madhuri dixit and Sanjay Dutt, Saroj Khan.\nIn a recent interview with Mid-day Khan was asked if she thinks the makers should have called her for the reprise version, to which she replied, “Maybe, they think that Masterji [referring to herself] has become old and Madhuri Dixit hasn’t. That’s why they have called her.”\nOn social media, Madhuri was seen teaching Alia and Varun steps from the original song and they semed to get it right!\nWhile she seemed confident about Varun’s dancing, Khan was unsure about Alia doing justice to this song since it (the original song) had Madhuri in it. “Varun is a good dancer and I know he will be able to do it [the steps] well, but I don’t know if Alia will be able to match up to Madhuri.
