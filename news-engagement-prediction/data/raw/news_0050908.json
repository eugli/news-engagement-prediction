Life under Islamic State militants \nThe freezing of the travel ban was announced by the director of East Libya's civil society commission, Abir Mneina, who had held talks with the military chief of staff of Libya's eastern region, Abdelrazzak al-Naduri, on Tuesday. \nShe told the BBC that officials had been asked to cancel the ban but agreed only to freeze it temporarily and carry out a review. \n\"He [Mr al-Naduri] said... there are security implications that need to be considered. We said fine, if there are specific security issues then we understand and support that because we are in a state of war and this is an important matter for us all,\" said Ms Mneina \n\"So that's why we finally agreed that the directive will be reviewed to ensure that there are no violations against rights and freedomsâ€¦ Our main aim is to get the order cancelled completely. \n\"I think we are headed on the path of it getting cancelled. We said that if it is not cancelled we are already preparing a legal statement that will be taken to court.\" \nA source in the office of Eastern Libya's chief of staff, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed to the BBC that the order had been frozen. \nHe said the ban was being reviewed because \"it may have generalised the matter too much\". \nLibya has been in chaos since Nato-backed forces overthrew Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. \nEastern Libya is governed by an administration based in al-Beyda that is not recognised by the international community. It is is under the control of commander Khalifa Hafter who is leading the battle against Islamist militias. \nLibya's internationally recognised government is based in the capital, Tripoli. \nThe travel restrictions highlighted the growing political divide in Libya, with each side enforcing its own rules in the area it controls.
