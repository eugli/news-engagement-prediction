What does Warren have to say? \nThe rebuke in the Senate gave Senator Warren and other Democrats an even bigger platform to assail Mr Sessions, the GOP and Mr Trump. \nAfter being voted down, Senator Warren went to the hallway where she continued to read the letter for a Facebook video that had drawn over 8 million views as of Wednesday afternoon (local time). \n\"This is about Coretta Scott King's letter. And that's all this is about,\" Senator Warren said after finishing more than an hour's worth of television interviews in the ornate rotunda of a Senate office building. \n\"And Mitch McConnell didn't want me to read that letter. He stopped me. And so I went out and read the letter anyway and posted it on a live feed.\" So, how did the GOP silence Warren? \nSenator Warren was chastised under a little-used Senate regulation, Rule 19 . \nSenator Mitch McConnell stood and invoked the rule, saying Senator Warren has \"impugned the motives and conduct of our colleague from Alabama\" in quoting the words from Ms King. \nIt bars any senator from impugning the motives of any other or imputing \"any conduct or motive unworthy or unbecoming of a senator\". \nIt is not yet known when the last rule was invoked, but Democrats have accused Republicans of selectively enforcing it. So, what now? \nBut with fierce opposition from Democrats and some voters over his civil rights and immigration record, the divisive debate sparked by his Senate appointment may continue. \nABC/wires First posted February 09, 2017 13:56:43 Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T05:38:18.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
