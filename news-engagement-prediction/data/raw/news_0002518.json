Scroll down for video Dozens of families in pollution hotspots could be evacuated under new clean air proposals. The plans would lead some to lose their homes under compulsory purchasing laws. Pictured are shoppers in Truro in Cornwall, one of the areas that could be affected by the proposals NITROGEN OXIDES Around 40,000 deaths a year are caused by air pollution in the UK, many a result of Nitrogen Dioxide pumped from diesel engines. Nitrogen dioxide is a pollutant that can often be seen as a reddish-brown smog over many urban areas. It is formed when fuel is burned at high temperatures. Its most common sources are diesel engines and power plants. Nitrogen dioxide is highly toxic to plants, animals and humans. High levels can be fatal as the chemical is very damaging to delicate lung tissue. The pollutant can cause respiratory problems, lung disease and cancer. The council admitted the scheme was controversial but said it was cheaper than building bypasses to take diesel vehicles away from residential areas. It said relocation was just one of many options being considered. But a council spokesperson said there was still 'no specific area' in mind for relocation. Around 40,000 deaths a year are caused by air pollution in the UK, many a result of nitrogen dioxide pumped from diesel engines. The pollutant can cause respiratory problems, lung disease and cancer. Many councils have brought in Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) to keep pollution levels below EU standards. There are seven Air Quality Management Areas (AQMAs) in Cornwall which fail to meet safe pollution levels. Truro, Gunnislake, St Austell, Tideford, Bodmin, Camelford and the area of Kerrier - containing Pool, Camborne and Redruth - have all been declared AQMAs since 2005.

As part of the 'Clean Air for Cornwall Strategy', six approaches have been explored, including building new neighbourhoods in 'clean air' zones.
