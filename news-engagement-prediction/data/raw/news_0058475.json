Since shortly after the Municipal Market caught fire and was demolished in 1974, market officials have been trying to reclaim the the former site as part of the market, Ben Franz-Knight , executive director of the Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority , explained while on a tour of the construction site Tuesday afternoon. 16 photos Artisan vendors Old Stove Brewing Co., Jarr & Co., Honest Biscuits and Indi Chocolate… more After eight other unsuccessful attempts to do something with the property, construction finally began in June 2015 on what is being called the MarketFront expansion. The work is expected to be complete in March, ahead of the grand opening this summer. Over the two years it has taken to get this project to this point, Franz-Knight said there have been many challenges, including getting all the funding together and the site design. \"The site is very challenging to build on,\" he said. \"It is a complicated design, so it takes a lot of coordination between the design team and the contractors.\" To see the construction progress look through the slideshow above. Once complete, the project will include a 300-stall underground public parking facility, 30,000 square feet of open public space, 40 low-income senior housing units that will open in two weeks, 47 new rooftop day stalls for farmers and artists and a neighborhood center with expanded social services. Artisan vendors Old Stove Brewing Co., Jarr & Co., Honest Biscuits and Indi Chocolate will have on-site production in 12,000 square feet of new commercial and production space, as well. Once construction is complete in March, those four locations will be able to start building out their spaces with tenant improvements for the grand opening in June, Franz-Knight said. In the commercial space, Old Stove will can beer to sell on site, and Indi Chocolate will be selling chocolate right off the line, he said. \"Every commercial tenant that is coming into this space is making something that they are selling,\" Franz-Knight said. \"One thing we wanted to capture was that 'meet the producer' tradition.\" Coral Garnick covers health care and retail for the Puget Sound Business Journal.
