View more sharing options Wednesday 22 February 2017 10.44 GMT Last modified on Wednesday 22 February 2017 10.45 GMT \nA crowdfunding campaign has been launched to fund the construction of a tribute to David Bowie in the form of a three-storey lightning bolt near his birthplace in Brixton. \nDesigned by artists at This Ain’t Rock’n’Roll , with consultation from members of the late star’s team, the memorial is a reference to Bowie’s Aladdin Sane album cover and would be located five streets away from Stansfield Road, London, where he was born. \nIt hopes to raise £990,000 in 28 days to fund the installation, which would stand next to Jimmy C’s famous Aladdin Sane mural. It had raised close to £30,000 in its first 24 hours. \nAccording to the campaign’s page , the nine-metre “iconic lightning flash” will be coloured in “gravity-defying red and blue-sprayed stainless steel”.

That music and art and curiosity are vital, positive contributors to our collective existence.” \nSupporters will get a range of rewards for pledging: £20 will get your name listed on the official David Bowie Memorial website, while £10,000 will get you a replica of the statue – named Ziggy Zag. This smaller version was created by Benson Sedgwick Engineering, which is building the actual Ziggy Zag, and previously designed bank notes for the Brixton pound, featuring David Bowie on its £10 denomination.
