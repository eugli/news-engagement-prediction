He would not have lived long thereafter, as he did not. Image copyright AFP Image caption Kim, seen here in a file photo, reportedly died before he could be taken to hospital \nIt appears that the North Korean government may have felt that they could claim the body and avoid an autopsy, thus denying the outside world knowledge of what had happened. \nMalaysia has proven diligent in insisting on an autopsy and clearly North Korea failed in its efforts to prevent this. This has led to a row between the two nations, Malaysia being one of few that had diplomatic relations with the North. \nSo how could it have actually gotten into Malaysia? Image copyright REX/Shutterstock Image caption A woman wearing a white top was thought to have attacked Mr Kim \nBecause the quantity required to kill is extraordinarily small, it could have been smuggled into Malaysia in a cartridge in a pen or some such thing. The security forces would have had no idea it was being smuggled in unless someone had tipped them off, which clearly did not happen. \nIt is unlikely that VX was made in Malaysia - it is not something that can be made safely in a kitchen sink. \nOf course, we don't know for sure that North Korea made it and it is also possible they may have purchased it from a third country. There is both a US and Soviet/Russian version of VX - and it will be interesting to see which version was eventually used. \nIt would take sophisticated laboratory analysis to tell them apart - which may already be done. \nVX is extremely stableâ€”like oil, it does not evaporate quickly. That made the VX safe on a cloth or some other surface until it touched human skin. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption VX, seen here in a container held by a US Army chemical school instructor, is a clear amber-coloured and oily liquid \nBut this use of VX, unheard of previously, is a serious violation of international standards. The fact that it was used in a foreign country means that Malaysia and other countries will be both appalled and furious. \nOf key importance will be how China responds. After all, China was reportedly providing protection for Kim Jong-nam. \nIf North Korea seriously violated international law, China should presumably do more than just cut off imports of North Korean coal. \nChina has the opportunity to punish North Korea and thereby hopefully deter them from doing this kind of attack again. \nA broader Chinese trade embargo would hurt North Korea seriously.
