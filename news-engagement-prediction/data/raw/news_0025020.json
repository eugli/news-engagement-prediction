Twice. \nOxendine recounted denying the \"nasty\" offer, telling ABC-11 : \n\"She said that she had a son and did I want her to put my child to her breast and breastfeed? And I said no, that's nasty. We don't do things like that.\" \nOxendine said just moments after she left the room, the security footage showed the daycare worker picking up the baby and breastfeeding him for several seconds until another worker in the room stood up to leave. \nRelated: Britney Spears Asks For Prayers Following Niece's ATV Accident \nDaycare director Daron Council confirmed the lactating culprit is no longer working there. \nEven though the woman was fired on Friday, Oxendine wants her to face criminal charges, as her son is lactose intolerant and can't have any milk products. She explained: \n\"To me, a criminal act was committed against him. Not only did you put your breast to my son, you also made my son sick because he's lactose intolerant. So you've put something in his body that his body can't digest.\" \nLocal police said they were investigating the incident as misdemeanor child abuse. No charges have been filed just yet, but Oxendine hopes \"there's justice for my son.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:45:30.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
