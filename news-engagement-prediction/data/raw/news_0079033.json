Warm milk in a small saucepan, then transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer. Stir in yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar, then set aside for 5-8 minutes until mixture is frothy. Stir in 2 1/2 cups of flour until it forms a a thin batter. Cover bowl and let rest in a warm spot for 30 minutes, until mixture has risen a bit and is very bubbly. \n2. In another bowl, whisk eggs until pale and light, about 3 minutes. Stir in 3/4 cup sugar, vanilla, and salt. Drizzle butter into yeast batter and stir gently. Working in increments, stir in egg mixture. Fit mixer with dough hook and set speed to low. Slowly add flour, just a little at a time, until a soft, sticky dough comes together. Transfer dough to a greased bowl, cover, and let rest in a warm spot for 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in size. \n3. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and roll into a 1/2\"-thick rectangle. (Sprinkle dough with a bit more flour if difficult to roll.) Using a 3\" or 4\" round cutter, trim the dough into rounds. Transfer rounds to a parchment lined baking sheet, then re-roll the scraps and repeat with remaining dough. Cover baking sheets and set aside in a warm spot for 45-60 minutes, until rounds double in size. \n4. While the rounds are rising, add 2 inches of oil to a large dutch oven or wide, tall-sided skillet set over medium heat. Using a deep-fry thermometer, monitor the oil temperature until it reaches 360 degrees F. Working 3 at a time, lower the rounds into the hot oil and cook, turning once, until deeply golden brown on all sides, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a rack set over a baking sheet to drain. Repeat with remaining rounds, making sure the oil temperature stays at 360 degrees F. \n5. Once the doughnuts are cool enough to handle, poke a hole in one side of each using a chopstick or the back of a wooden spoon. Spoon preserves into a piping bag or a plastic storage bag fitted with a piping tip, then squeeze filing into each doughnut. \n6. In a small bowl, combine 1 cup confectioners' sugar with 3 tablespoons water. Drizzle glaze over doughnuts until shiny. Sprinkle with a pinch of confectioners' sugar and top with candied orange peel, if desired.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:49:02.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
