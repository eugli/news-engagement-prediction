The 18-year-old posed for a group photo with Lhuillier and friends at the Cloud Nine Alpine Bistro in Aspen, Colo., wearing a white long-sleeved shirt and a red, white, and blue ski hat emblazoned with “USA.” Lhuillier posted the image to Instagram on Monday, where it quickly racked up more than 1,600 likes.\n\n\nThe ski trip was one of many public outings for Malia, who’s spending a gap year interning at the office of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein (in the marketing or development departments, per The Hollywood Reporter ), before attending Harvard University in the fall.\nOn Feb. 3, Malia hit the Girls final-season premiere party in New York (she interned on the HBO show’s sixth season), and in January, she was spotted at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. According to a report by Us Weekly , Malia bought a Sundance sweatshirt while accompanied by a Secret Service agent.\nMalia Obama hangs with Lena Dunham on the set of \"Girls\" in Brooklyn http://t.co/dABScnN7yS pic.twitter.com/pW7PWBPWO5 \n— Page Six (@PageSix) July 3, 2015 \n\n\nThis past fall, Malia also took a group trip to Bolivia and Peru through the educational organization Where There Be Dragons . And she wasn’t treated any differently from the other teens on the $83-per-day trip, assisting with daily tasks such as cooking. Tour guide Gregario Mamani told the  New York Times of the former president’s daughter, “She was very humble, chatty, spoke Spanish very well. She was mesmerized by the Bolivian landscape.”\nThe Aspen trip likely solidified the bond between Lhuillier and the former first family — Michelle Obama has worn the designer’s gowns to the White House Correspondents’ Dinner in 2013, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2014, and to an event with the pope in 2015.\nMalia is clearly taking a cue from her dad, former President Barack Obama , who is currently in full-on vacation mode .\nPhoto: Jack Brockway/Virgin.com More Read More: \nA Brief History of First Kids’ Fashion \nWhy Tracee Ellis Ross Refuses to Live in a ‘Concealer Culture’ \nDesigner Sends Message to President Trump Using Rainbow Sequins: ‘Love Sees No Color’ \nFollow us on Instagram , Facebook , and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:21:41.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
