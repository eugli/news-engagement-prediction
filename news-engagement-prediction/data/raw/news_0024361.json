Elizabeth Warren vows to monitor sexist bigot Jeff Sessions for expressions of his racial hatred Posted at 11:35 pm on February 8, 2017 by Brett T. \nHere‚Äôs a shock to no one: following Jeff Sessions‚Äô confirmation as U.S. Attorney General Wednesday, his former Senate colleague Elizabeth Warren vowed that she would not be silenced again. \nWait ‚Ä¶ did we mention that Sessions was confirmed? \n‚Äî Jason C. (@CounterMoonbat) February 9, 2017 \nThe resistance really hasn‚Äôt had a good time of it this week, what with the confirmations of both Betsy DeVos and Jeff Sessions. Warren, who had inspired the #ShePersisted hashtag, did indeed persist. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she won't be silent about Jeff Sessions'\"radical hatred\" https://t.co/St66qNpzZv pic.twitter.com/RShWNuLbK6 \n‚Äî CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) February 9, 2017 Get out your industrial strength earplugs. The War Cry of #Fauxocantas hath been unleashed. https://t.co/9PNT9e4HyV \n‚Äî Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) February 9, 2017 \nConsider this: It was only last June that Hillary Clinton, a shoe-in to be America‚Äôs 45th president, reportedly was envisioning a ‚Äúbeer summit‚Äù of sorts in her first 100 days in office, exploiting her ‚Äúability to use alcohol as a political lubricant‚Äù to hold a ‚Äúrelaxed, frank discussion‚Äù with her political opponents. \nAnd Warren, who campaigned fiercely with Clinton, seemed to be OK with that ‚Ä¶ before Nov. 9. If we were Jeff Sessions, we wouldn‚Äôt be swallowing any beverage put in front of us, regardless of alcohol content, while Warren was anywhere around. \nHer tweetstorm was utterly predictable, but if it makes it any more fun to read, check out the number of likes on each one. I‚Äôm deeply disappointed that the Senate voted to confirm Jeff Sessions as Attorney General tonight. \n‚Äî Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9, 2017 Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully & fairly enforce the law. \n‚Äî Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9, 2017 Thanks to you, everyone now knows the concerns that Coretta Scott King had about Jeff Sessions. Concerns that millions of people still have. \n‚Äî Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9,   \nYes, we‚Äôve all read the letter ‚Ä¶ the one that‚Äôs not a fraction as damning as Warren‚Äôs tweets suggest. There‚Äôs no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly & clearly: This is just the beginning. \n‚Äî Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9, 2017 If Jeff Sessions turns a blind eye while @realDonaldTrump violates the Constitution or breaks the law, he'll hear from all of us. \n‚Äî Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9, 2017 If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism & bigotry into @TheJusticeDept , he'll hear from all of us. \n‚Äî Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9, 2017 And you better believe every Senator who voted to put Jeff Sessions‚Äôs radical hatred into @TheJusticeDept will hear from all of us, too. \n‚Äî Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9, 2017 Consider this MY warning: We won‚Äôt be silent. We will speak out. And we WILL persist. \n‚Äî Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) February 9, 2017 \nThat certainly does sound like a warning: Someone is running for president already‚Ä¶ https://t.co/couwe9uff0 \n‚Äî Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) February 9, 2017 @SenWarren @TheJusticeDept we hear from you all the time.
