With this ruling, the housing developer can’t just go to the Housing Controller for an extension of time to complete the project in order to avoid paying the liquidated damages to house buyers. \n“This is because if an extension of time is allowed, house buyers lose their rights to claim damages for late delivery of vacant possession,” he added. \nWong explained that according to the liquidated damages clause, the condo buyers can claim 10% per annum of the purchase price for the delay. \nIn their application for judicial review, the condo buyers stated that they wanted to quash the decision allowing BHL Construction Sdn Bhd an extension of time for the delivery of vacant possession from 36 months to 48 months. \nThey also asked the court for a declaration that Regulation 11(3) was ultra vires of the Housing Development Act (Control and Licensing) Act. \nWong said the judge has ordered the parties to address the issue of costs on the next date for case management. \nWhen contacted, SFC Mohamad Rizal said the judge also allowed a similar application involving another group of condominium buyers involving the same developer and project. \nRelated story: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:58:41.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
