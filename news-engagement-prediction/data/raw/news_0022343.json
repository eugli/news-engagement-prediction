If it’s a hit, the company hopes to take it to the mass market. \nThe doll was designed and sculpted by company founder Robert Tonner. His company has made dolls based on a variety of TV, film and book characters including Spiderman, Harry Potter, Dr. Who and Wonder Woman. \n“Jazz stands for everything I respect from a human nature point of view — she’s incredibly brave, intelligent, warm-hearted and creative,” Tonner said. \nJennings appeared at age 6 on a Barbara Walters 20/20 special in 2007. She has identified as a female since she could talk, her parents told ABC News. \nShe is the youngest person ever to be recognized in The Advocate Magazine’s “Top Forty Under 40” annual list and was named as one of Time Magazine’s Most Influential Teens for 2014 and 2015. \nIn 2014, Jennings co-wrote a children’s picture book titled “I Am Jazz” and her memoir, “Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen,” was released last summer. \nThe Jazz Jennings doll comes 40 years after the release of the “Gay Bob” doll, widely thought to be the first doll based on a gay characte r. \n© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
