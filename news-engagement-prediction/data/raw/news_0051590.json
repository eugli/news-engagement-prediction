He prayed for an interim injunction to prevent the state government from constructing Jayalalithaa’s memorial. \nOn February 14, the apex court had restored in the judgement and findings of the trial court in Bengaluru which held all the accused, including Jayalalithaa, guilty in the corruption case. However, the court abated the proceedings in the case against Jayalalithaa, who breathed her last on December 5 last year. \nJayalalithaa and three others were accused of amassing disproportionate assets to the tune of Rs 66.65 crore during her first term as the chief minister from 1991 to 1996. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:15:14.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
