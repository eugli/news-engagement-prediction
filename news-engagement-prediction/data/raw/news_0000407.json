MARK TAYLOR FAIRFAX NZ \nEight-year-old Molly chills out inside her own caravan. \nFor Nunn, who's hauled the 10.6ft fibreglass home up from Palmerston North to Hamilton for the weekend's CaraVamp Retro Show, it's a \"never-ending love affair\". \nREAD MORE: \n\"I'm always perfecting it, adding detail and finding the right things for the era.\" MARK TAYLOR FAIRFAX NZ \nPeter Nunn made the trek from Palmerston North with his retro caravan Orange Roughy. \nFrom the psychedelic carpet tiles imported from Australia to the Kiwiana tea towels, Nunn has worked tirelessly for four years to make it what it is today. \nThe paint job he matched to his classic car - a 1968 Nissan Gloria. \nAfter remodelling the inside of the caravan, Nunn installed solar panels on the roof to power the fridge and LED lights, and with a grey and fresh water system, he is fully self contained. MARK TAYLOR FAIRFAX NZ \nShayne and Angela Bennie, and Alex,16 months, enjoy the sunshine at the CaraVamp caravan show, open on Saturday and Sunday from 10am. \n\"You can park at places without having to stay at campgrounds.\" Ad Feedback \nOver in the shade of a tassel-strung umbrella sits Dorothy - the mannequin Nunn jokingly refers to as his mother-in-law. \nThey are all part of the relaxed, heat-hazy atmosphere outside the Classics Museum & Jukebox Diner down Railside Place in Hamilton this weekend. MARK TAYLOR FAIRFAX NZ \nKiwiana tea towels add a touch of a bygone era to the caravan. \nAs the sun heated up a city Saturday, cars rolled in from 10am. \nOrganiser Brent Burne said the show was a laid back way for caravan lovers to get together. \n\"Everyone has come from all over the place - some from down south. MARK TAYLOR FAIRFAX NZ \nInside Peter Nunn's 1970s Lilliput caravan. \n\"The whole caravan community is friendly and there are people with caravans at home looking for ideas.\" \nCaravans have exploded in popularity, he said. \n\"I think a lot of it is people reminiscing about the times they spent camping with their parents.\" \nOne of those who loves to escape in a caravan is Angela Bennie. \nShe's always loved caravans and four years ago convinced her partner, Shayne, it was time to purchase. \nThey made the trek from their home in Waihi Beach to Winton in the South Island, where they picked up their 1966 Caravelle. \n\"Shayne wasn't really into the caravan scene. All the way down he moaned he was 'going all the way to the South Island to pick up my wife's caravan'.\" \nOnce bought, they'd only gone 50 metres and Shayne was in love. That first morning back home, he began the reno. \nJust like Nunn, they opted to mirror the colour scheme of their own Cadillac - purple - and paired it with black and white chequered floors inside and out. \n\"And then I had fun shopping - getting bits and pieces for the inside,\" Angela says with a laugh. \nIt was the rounded concords and easily maintained fibreglass structure of the Caravelle that appealed to the Bennies. \nCaravelle caravans were originally built by an Auckland boat builder who tested his caravans in the waters of the Waitemata Harbour. \n\"He wanted to prove the caravan didn't leak, because the fibreglass was a bit different than the metal used in those days.\" \nFor the Bennies, caravans are an escape from everyday life. \n\"We both have pretty stressful jobs and we had the classic car. And it's much cheaper than staying in hotels.\" \nThey enjoyed the experience of caravan living until 16-month-old Alex came along. \n\"Now Alex takes up half the cupboard space.\" \nHead along to the show day at 11 Railside Place, Dinsdale, on Sunday from 10am to 3pm.
