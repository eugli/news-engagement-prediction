David Bursten said during the press conference in Delphi. “There’s no doubt in our minds that that young lady is a hero.” The bodies of teen Liberty German and Abigail Williams were found near a creek in northern Indiana after they had been reported missing on Feb. 13. (Handout) \nAdditional video, also taken from Libby’s phone, will not be released because the investigation is ongoing, Bursten said. \nAbby and Libby, both from Carroll County were first reported missing on Feb. 13 after they didn’t return from a hike on the Delphi Historic trails. Their bodies were found the next day just outside the city in the woods near Deer Creek — less than a mile from an abandoned railroad bridge where they were dropped off. \n“Evidence in the case has led investigators to believe that this is a double-homicide and that’s what we’re investigating at this time,” Indiana State Police spokesman Sgt. Tony Slocum said, advising those following the case to avoid “the rumor mill.” \nSearch expands for suspect in connection with Ind. teen murders \nPolice previously released a photo — also recovered from Libby’s phone — of a man wearing a dark blue jacket hoodie, jeans and a hat as he walked along the Delphi Historic trails. The subject of the photo was initially labeled as a person interest but Slocum on Wednesday said officers believe he is a suspect. Police believe this man wearing a dark hoodie may be a suspect in the girls' deaths. (Indiana State Police) \nSlocum said it’s unclear whether the voice in the audio clip is that of the man of the in the photo and added there is a chance that they should be looking for more than one suspect. \nIndiana State Police Superintendent Douglas Carter got emotional while discussing the tragic loss of the two teen girls. \n“Why Libby? Why Abby? Why Delphi? Why Carroll County?” he wondered. “I say that because this is a classic example, a clear example, that evil lives amongst us. \n“To every person seeing this in some form, we need you ... Abby and Libby need you.” \nCarter called on the public to phone in with any suspicions or tips prompted by the either the photo or the audio recording. \n“Please do not rationalize tips away — rationalize what you think may not be important away — by thinking he would never do that to a human being or think what I know doesn’t matter,” he said. \nAnyone with information on the case is asked to call the Delphi Murder Tip Line at 844-459-5786.
