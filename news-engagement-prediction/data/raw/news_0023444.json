Negative social interactions 'major driver' of mental illness \nThe ANU study found that negative social interactions were more likely to drive long-term mental health problems than an individual's sexual orientation. \nThe research aimed to challenge the common perception that homosexual and bisexual people were at risk of poor mental health and suicide. \nSince the late 1990s the research team has tracked more than 5,000 adults from the ACT and Queanbeyan. \n\"The risk that has often been associated with sexual orientation, or non-heterosexual orientation, is due to other risk factors which may be more predominant amongst [those] people,\" lead researcher Richard Burns said. \n\"The presence of positive or negative social interactions and support were really big drivers in people's mental health outcomes.\" \nCommon risk factors like sexual trauma, childhood trauma and smoking were also identified as posing more of a long-term mental health risk than non-heterosexual orientation. \n\"There was very little risk for poor mental health amongst those with a homosexual orientation, particularly for those who remain stable and continue to identify as homosexual as they age,\" Dr Burns said. \n\"In terms of those who identified as bisexual orientation, they did appear to have an increased risk of poor mental ill health, but we found that was being driven by other well-known risk factors for poor mental health.\" Study could break down myths around homosexuality Photo: Kylie Walker (right) and her partner Anita Dwyer met about four years ago. (Supplied) \nMs Walker said a lot of systemic discrimination against LGBTI people was based on the premise of mental illness. \n\"[Non-heterosexual orientation] was classified as a mental illness [in the past in the United States] and anything that we can do to say it is normal, and to be mentally healthy and be homosexual, is very important,\" she said. \nMs Walker said the support of her family and friends played a critical role in helping her overcome depression. \n\"The years since coming out have in many ways been the best in my life,\" she said. \n\"Even if you don't have that support you can find that support elsewhere, there is the family you are born into and there is the family that you choose.\" \nIf you or someone you know needs help, you can call Lifeline on 13 11 14, Kids Helpline on 1800 551 800, Mensline Australia on 1300 789 978 or the Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T14:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:38:06.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
