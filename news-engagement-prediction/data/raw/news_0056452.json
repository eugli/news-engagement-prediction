(Photo: Anthony Gruppuso, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe Washington Wizards need depth, and the Brooklyn Nets need draft picks. \nOn Wednesday, the Wizards traded forward Andrew Nicholson, guard-forward Marcus Thornton and a 2017 first-round pick to the Nets for shooting guard Bojan Bogdanovic and forward Chris McCullough, two people with knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports. \nThe people requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly until the deal is official. \nThe 2017 first-round pick going to the Nets from the Wizards is lottery protected, so it’s just about guaranteed given Washington’s position in the Eastern Conference that the Nets will get the pick in the June draft. The Nets will also have Boston’s first-round pick (Boston has Brooklyn’s), giving the Nets two first-round picks that will fall in 20s. \nGALLERY: NBA TRADE DEADLINE TRACKER Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:21:33.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
