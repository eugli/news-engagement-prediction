Fox, who became a United States citizen some 20 years ago, remembered being annoyed at the 8-year process to citizenship and now wonders what he was complaining about. 'I'm proud to stand here today in support of values and principles that I admire,' Fox told the crowd. With the Academy Awards scheduled for Sunday, Hollywood has also waded into the political dispute. Jodie Foster (left) and Michael J. Fox (right) headlined a protest over Trump's recent immigration orders in Los Angeles on Friday 'You have people who have given up everything, who have lost everything they have. They are struggling to keep their families alive and keep food in their mouths and disease away from their bodies and took tremendous risk to get to this country, and we say no?' Key said the event was intended to 'support the creative community's growing concern with anti-immigration sentiment in the United States of America and its potential chilling effect on the global exchange of ideas, not to mention freedom of expression.' Trump also lashed out at the media once again on Saturday, tweeting that the press 'has not reported that the national debt in my first month went down by $12 billion vs. a $200 billion increase in Obama's [sic] first month.' He also tweeted: 'Great optimism for future of US business, AND JOBS, with the DOW having an 11th straight record close. Big tax & regulation cuts coming!' On Wednesday, Trump met with top aides at the White House to discuss the budget, which is expected to include a number of spending cuts. We're going to take this budget, which is in all fairness I've only been here for four weeks, so I can't take too much of the blame for what's happened but it is absolutely out of control,' Trump said as he met with his budget team Wednesday. 'Unfortunately, the budget that we're inheriting essentially inherit something a mess,' Trump said as he allowed reporters to get pictures while he met with his budget team. 'The finances of our country are a mess, but we're going to clean them up,' he vowed. 'Things that we've been doing, including negotiating deals that have already been negotiated, so you call it re-negotiating – on airplanes and lots of other things, military items – we'll end up either getting many more planes free, or we're going to save a lot of money.' 'But we've already saved a lot – billions and billions of dollars have been saved,' Trump said. 'Things that we've been doing, including negotiating deals that have already been negotiated, so you call it renegotiating on airplanes and lots of other things, military items,' he said.
