(Source: ANI) \nSoon after Prime Minister Narendra Modi took a hard-hitting jibe at opposition parties with his SCAM analog, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minster and SP chief Akhilesh has retaliated to what he said in a similar manner. Addressing an election rally in Auraiya district in UP, the CM said, “Desh ko SCAM se bachana hai, A aur M se jinke naam aate hain unse bachana hai.” (We have to save the country from SCAM, we have to save the country from those whose names are from A and M). The comment was surely a shot at Bharatiya Janata Party president Amit Shah and PM Modi. Desh ko SCAM se bachana hai, A aur M se jinke naam aate hain unse bachana hai, save the country from Amit Shah and Modi: Akhilesh Yadav pic.twitter.com/FjySlBqUXc \n— ANI UP (@ANINewsUP) February 4, 2017 \nFurther in his attack, Akhilesh said, “PM banne ke liye unhone rajnitik plaayan kiya hai, Gujarat se shayad PM nahi ban sakte thay.” (To become the Prime Minister, Modi did a political migration). \nPM Modi during his rally in Meerut earlier today, took a dig at Samajwadi Party, Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party together. The Prime Minister used another acronym, this time for ‘SCAM’. He said that S stands for Samajwadi, C for Congress, A for Akhilesh Yadav and M for Mayawati, drawing huge response from the crowd. \nYou might also want to see this: \nThe ruling Samajwadi Party has been on Narendra Modi’s radar for not being able to maintain law and order in the state. During his speech, he also mocked the grand UP alliance, asking the reason behind SP-Congress coalition, as those who used to criticise each other have joined hands over night. He also said that those who could not save themselves, how will they save UP. \nHowever, Akhilesh on the other hand, have said on various occasions that the coalition will win an overwhelming majority in the upcoming UP assembly polls and get more than 300 seats in the 403-member House. “This election is not only about state but also about the nation. People say that we should not have given so many seats to Congress but we have a big heart,” he said addressing a rally lately.
