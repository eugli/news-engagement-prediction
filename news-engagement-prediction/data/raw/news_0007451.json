Haven St. in Highlandtown still looks like the factory and the warehouse it served as since 1901. The doors that serve as the main entrance from the off-street parking are obvious upgrades, but once inside, the space maintained its open feel and that was exactly what brothers Ken and Matthew Praay were going for. 6 photos The roughly 1,100-square-foot tap room will be part of the new Monument City Brewing Co.… more From the brewery system and tanks to the storage in the back and the distribution side of the operations, Ken Praay said they wanted to give off the feeling that those that came to visit the tap room on weekends were inside the brewery, and not just in a secluded section. \"Our whole vision was to have the tap room sit inside the brewery as opposed to separate from it,\" he said. \"It is a very minimalistic approach in the tap room.\" Praay took the time this week to tour me around the new facility, the first for the brothers after setting up shop in Baltimore in 2014 as contract brewers at Peabody Heights Brewing near the Johns Hopkins University campus. The space is expected to open by the end of February. The entrance to the brewery is actually the back of the building, but off-street parking will make it easier for guests to come grab a brew. The space neighbors the former King Cork and Seal Co. building now home to the Emerging Technology Centers incubator. Monument City Brewing has 12,800 square feet to work with, which in the beginning will allow them to produce five times as much beer. At Peabody Heights, Praay said they could produce up to 1,000 barrels a year, but the current set up allows for up to 5,000 barrels annually. But that could be just the beginning. Praay said they have first right of refusal to additional space on the south side of the current space that would expand the square footage to about 20,000. In total, the new brewery could have the capacity to brew up to 20,000 barrels annually, although Praay said that could be a long time out. \"At Peabody we were very limited by the availability of the tanks,\" he said. \"It could take 10 to 15 years, but I hope we get to the point where we need to expand further down the road.\" The build out of the space had a set back on Christmas night when a car ran into the southwest corner of the building off Haven, taking out a portion of the wall. The wall is still being repaired, but the car didn't destroy the new windows already installed. The tap room will occupy about 1,100 square feet and have seating for around 50. Space is also being reserved for live music. No food will be prepared or served at the brewery, but Praay said they are partnering with restaurants nearby to offer menus at the tap room as well as local food trucks. Currently, Monument City Brewing has two core beers — 51 Rye IPA and American Brown Ale. With the new brewery, that lineup will double with the Battle IPA being upgraded from a seasonal beer to a core product while Praay said they will also begin making a pilsner year round. The brewery will then take the opportunity to make about four seasonal and limited beers, with the tap room offering a space to try out new brews. Because of the production expansion, the brothers have hired three additional employees. About 96 percent of Monument City Brewing's distribution is currently in Baltimore City, so Praay said they will look to get into Anne Arundel County as well as expand south and west, but stay in Maryland. Praay did not disclose how much was invested in the new brewery, but he said it was important for the company to remain in the city and they felt Highlandtown was a great location to be in. \"This building was cool with open spaces and high ceilings and a lot of character,\" he said. \"And we liked the access to it from the neighborhood, which we love being a part of.\" The tap room will be open 5-8 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays and 12-5 p.m. on Saturdays when it opens in late February.
