Since it happened at the start, the race underwent a full restart without Brayton. \nWhile broadcast cameras caught the incident, none gave quite the view that Davi Millsaps’ onboard did. \nComing out of the first turn, Millsaps’ onboard shows Brayton getting crossed up and going down, with his head making contact with Justin Bogle’s front wheel just before it hit the ground. \nBrayton was able to get up and walk away while Bogle went on to finish the Main in ninth. Millsaps, meanwhile, would go on to finish the race in eighth. 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:05:56.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
