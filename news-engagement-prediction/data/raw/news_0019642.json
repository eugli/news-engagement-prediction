Variety reports that SNL ’s ratings have shot up 22 percent since President Trump’s election. The program’s numbers are said to have been initially helped by Alec Baldwin ’s popular impression of the commander-in-chief, and then recently bolstered by Melissa McCarthy ’s surprise impression of gum-swallowing White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. \nThis actually wouldn’t be the first time “Weekend Update” airs on … well, not the weekend, as it had short Thursday night runs back during the 2008 and 2012 general election cycles. NBC even tried to make the same thing work in 2009, though it clearly didn’t stick. \nNBC did not respond to Politico ’s request for further comment, so details on the potential spin-off are still scarce. Be sure to stay tuned to Paste for more news on the network’s plans for the show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:29:07.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
