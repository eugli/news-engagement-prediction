The look consists of long coat, vest coat and cargo pants, all dark in colour. However, it’s the top hat and his van-dyke beard that steals the show. To get this look right, stick to a dark uniform colour. \nPost apocalyptic cool \nRugged sand coloured leather jacket, a Henley and a pair of cargo pants and cargo boots— his post apocalyptic desert warrior look in the movie Mad Max (2015) was quite the rage among cosplayers. Our advice? Go for a military jacket and opt for dark shades of brown. For the perfect look, distress the jacket and the cargo pants. The key to acing this look is to distress the jacket and the cargo pants. It’s perfect for a summer safari. \nSlick and suave \nYou can’t forget him as Eames, the cunning conman from Inception. Apart from the smart-casual combo of open collar shirts and blazer, it was the added touch of pocket squares and vintage watches which made the look perfect. We suggest, opt for a wool blazer with an open neck shirt and pair it with straight-leg linen-blend trousers and penny loafers. \nGatsby-esque swag \nIn Lawless (2012), Hardy played a classy bootlegger. Set in 1930’s, he wore open-ended V-neck cardigans paired with mandarin collar shirts and striped pants. Hardy’s cardigan became so popular that the fans coined a new term for the cardigan, ‘Hardigan’. To get the look right, layer your cardigan with mandarin collar shirts and pair with flannel trousers and a pair of sleek brown shoes. Stick with subtle colours such as grey and finish the look with a fedora hat. \nSuit it up \nIn 2015, Hardy played a double role in the gangster runaway hit Legends. Set in the 1960’s, he wore two outfits for his roles. One look consisted of classic dark coloured three piece suits with double breasted jackets. His other look consisted of single breasted jackets, worn either open or fastened. This look was more casual and relaxed compared to other look, and exposed more of the white shirt. The key to acing the classic 60’s suit and tie is to not go for a slim fit look, but a little loose fitted look made in a heavier fabric with a visible texture. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T01:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:08.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
