Damon came out decked out in Brady's jersey and rocking his football helmet, but it was clear the ruse wasn't going to hold up -- mostly because you could still see Damon's face, and he didn't alter his voice at all. WATCH: Matt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel Burst Out Laughing at Couples Therapy After Kimmel pulled the helmet off, the audience went wild, cheering for the Great Wall actor uproariously as an annoyed Kimmel tried to get them to calm down. \"Touchdown!\" an extremely amped up Damon yelled at Kimmel. \"I won the Super Bowl and I won your stupid show!\" WATCH: Matt Damon Runs a Hilarious Attack Ad on Jimmy Kimmel's Vice Presidential Campaign Kimmel told Damon that his stunt didn't count as being a guest on the show because he didn't sit down on the couch, and then had Damon forcibly removed by security. However, that didn't seem to put a damper on the star's mood. Sports reporter Rich Eisen caught up with Damon in the JKL dressing room -- which was covered floor-to-ceiling in plastic -- as he shook up some celebratory champagne to commemorate his big win. While Brady never actually made an appearance on Kimmel's show, the MVP's coach, Bill Belichick, and teammate, Julian Edelman, were in New York, sitting down with Jimmy Fallon. Jimmy has some ideas for @Edelman11 on how to market his famous #SB51 catch #FallonTonight pic.twitter.com/IYNaa3xPas â€” Fallon Tonight (@FallonTonight) February 7, 2017 Kimmel and Damon's long-running (and fictitious) feud has been an endless well of comedy for the late night host, who has been sparring with the Oscar winner since his show began. Last February, Damon made it onto JKL yet again when his bestie, Ben Affleck, smuggled him into the studio inside a trench coat , only to pop out, mid-interview. Check out the video below to see the bizarrely hilarious moment.
