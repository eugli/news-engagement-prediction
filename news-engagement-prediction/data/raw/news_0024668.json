February 2nd 2017 \nCARLTON cult figure Dennis Armfield will join the Blues’ leadership group in 2017, with Marc Murphy retained as skipper for the fifth consecutive year. \nMurphy, 29, will lead a seven-man leadership group, with Kade Simpson his deputy. \nArmfield is the only new addition to the group, with Sam Docherty, Bryce Gibbs, Ed Curnow, Patrick Cripps all retained. \nThat Murphy has been reappointed is significant given the posturing between he and coach Brendon Bolton when the took over the role vacated by Mick Malthouse. Carlton’s 2017 leadership group. Source: Supplied \n“Marc continues to be a tremendous leader for our club and across the past 12 months in particular, has played a vital role in shaping and reinforcing our values and behaviours, particularly working closely with the younger players,” Bolton told the club’s website. \n“Kade, Bryce, Patrick, Sam and Ed are already established leaders at our football club, all finishing in the top five of our Best and Fairest count in 2016 which is a clear indication of them all leading from the front on field too. \n“In 2016, we set about building leadership density across our list. This year, we are sticking to the road map and ensuring there is a consistent level of leadership across the board.” \nBolton said he welcomed the injection of new blood in Armfield to the leadership group. \nArmfield has a part-time coaching role with Carlton’s AFL Women’s team and has become one of the most loved players at the club. \n“With only one change to our leadership group for 2017, we are building on the foundations that were set last season,” Bolton said. \n“Dennis is a very influential member of our playing group and on the clear vote from his teammates, comes into the spot vacated by Andrew Walker.” \nJLT Community Series - Don’t miss your Footy team’s youngsters on show!
