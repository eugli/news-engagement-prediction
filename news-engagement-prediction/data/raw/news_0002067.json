Ms Markopoulou said: 'It is a really important development in architectural innovation and experimentation.' They are hoping this bridge will open up more opportunities for using 3D printing in civil engineering. 'Prefabrication minimises costs, it is quicker and more sustainable', Ms Markopoulou said. The bridge was inaugurated on 14 December in the urban park of Castilla-La Mancha in Alcobendas, Madrid. During construction, waste was reduced by recycling of raw materials during manufacture. The bridge, which is in a park just outside of Madrid, is 12 metres long and 1.75 metres wide. It is printed on micro-refined concrete The bridge is made up of eight different parts, each made of concrete powder micro-reinforced with thermoplastic polypropylene. Ms Markopoulou said: 'This is an evolutionary technique which involves depositing layers of material one sheet on another. 'Instead of using ink like a normal printer, we are depositing construction material. 'Bridges are often used in to practice architectural principles and so it was an important exercise for experimentation.' The IAAC worked with architects, mechanical and structural engineers, and municipal representatives to bring the design to life. The researchers used an evolutionary technique which involves depositing layers of material one sheet on another. Pictured from left to right are Alexandre Dubor, Areti Markopoulou and Rodrigo Aguirre The bridge is made up of eight different parts, each made of concrete powder micro-reinforced with thermoplastic polypropylene The construction relied on a massive 3D printer - the first of its kind - which can bind sand to solid rock. 'The computational design also allows to maximize the structural performance, being able to dispose the material only where it is needed, with total freedom of forms', a representative from the IAAC said. The structure maintains porosity 'thanks to the application of generative algorithms and challenging the traditional techniques of construction,' the representative said. The bridge is in the urban park of Castilla-La Mancha in Alcobendas in the south of Madrid", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:41:09.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
