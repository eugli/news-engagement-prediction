I’ve tried to be clear that our game is fundamentally sound, and it does not need to be fixed. I think last season was a concrete demonstration of the potential of our game to captivate the nation and its unique place in American culture. … \n“At the same time, I think it’s a mistake to stick our head in the sand and ignore the fact that our game has changed, and continues to change.’’ \nManfred, citing research, said that baseball had more inactivity in their games that any time in history. Home runs were up 32% since 1980, and strikeouts increased by an alarming 67%. The emergence of powerful bullpens also limited the amount of late lead changes. \n“I’m firmly convinced that our fans want us to respond to and manage the change that’s going on in the game. I’m certain our job as stewards of the game is to be responsive to fans, and I reject the notion that we can educate fans to embrace the game as it’s currently been played.’’ NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.
