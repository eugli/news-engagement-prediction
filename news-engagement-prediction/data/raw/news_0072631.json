Its Chinese name means “golden silk wood”.\nIt was used by Ming dynasty emperors for their thrones and bedroom furniture, and whole logs of the wood were used in the construction of the Forbidden City.\nIt is now under second-class national protection and sells for a fortune, a report said.\nFound in Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan and Sichuan, the tree is listed as a “vulnerable” species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.\nLin forged a certificate of authenticity for the tree trunk. \nThe buyer later got an expert to check the tree, and was told that it was worthless. \nThe buyer found that Lin had slipped away by then.\nPolice later tracked Lin down and arrested him. — The Straits Times / Asia News Network", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:03:30.558+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
