It cut its growth forecast for the year to March, 2017, to 6.9% from the 7.1% it had predicted in December. \nBut the central bank is confident of a rebound. \n\"Growth is expected to recover sharply,\" the bank said in a statement, adding that activity will be \"rapidly restored\" in sectors such as retail, transportation and hotels that rely heavily on cash transactions. \n\"Discretionary consumer demand held back by [the cash ban] is expected to bounce back,\" the RBI added.
