Photo: Matthew Mirabelli \nWith no heavy showers or strong winds expected over the next seven days, carnival enthusiasts and float-makers are expecting huge crowds to admire their creations in the capital while enjoying a party atmosphere. \nThough the official programme started on Thursday evening with an opening ceremony in Pjazza Teatru Rjal, it was only yesterday that the traditional, colourful floats entered the scene. \nDancers from rival companies took centre stage at St George’s Square, which hosted the traditional dancing competition, followed by the floats défilé led by King Carnival. \nOnce again, political controversy provided fertile ground for satirical floats: ministers Konrad Mizzi and Evarist Bartolo and PN executive committee president Ann Fenech featured prominently. Furthermore, this year’s edition includes a float sponsored by Malta’s EU presidency which is the result of a collaboration between British cartoonist Steve Bell, the Cicco Carnival Company and the Malta Arts Council. Konrad Mizzi, Evarist Bartolo and PN executive committee president Ann Fenech featured prominently \nThe carnival colours will affirm part of Malta's cultural identity that all can be proud of – leaving the best impression on the other EU member states, a statement from the Presidency Unit said. \nToday's programme starts at 9.30am with the children’s carnival in St George’s Square, which will also host a dance competition from 3pm onwards, followed by the Qarċilla, a performance of street theatre. \nTomorrow morning, St Joseph High Road in Ħamrun takes centre stage for the carnival band parade, while from 1pm onwards activities shift to Valletta with the traditional floats défilé. The Nadur Carnival lived up to its name.
