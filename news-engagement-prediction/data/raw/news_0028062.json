Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA mother who murdered her 19-day-old baby after subjecting him to a catalogue of abuse was today sentenced to life in prison. \nNicola Brown, 43, will have to serve a minimum of 14 and a half years for the fatal attack on her son Jake Young as she killed him with a blow to the head. \nAt an earlier hearing, the court heard the attack on little Jake exactly two years ago included a blow of “astonishing force” to his head with a hard object. \nThe youngster was found to have suffered a number of horrific injuries, including bruises to his scalp, a fractured skull, a bilateral brain haemorrhage and bleeding to his eyes. \nExperts examining his body after his death found he also had 17 fractures to his ribs, and the prosecution claimed he was “probably shaken”.

Yesterday he was knocked out of the baby basket - he’s definitely not breathing. \n“He’s 19 days old and I didn’t think there was anything wrong with him when he was knocked out of the baby basket.” \nShe was today sentenced at Winchester Crown Court, Hants, to life imprisonment and must serve a minimum of 14 years and six months. Brown had denied murder but was convicted by a jury.
