MOSTLY TRUE MOSTLY TRUE ORIGIN \nIn January 2017, white nationalist Richard Spencer was punched in the face, igniting a debate about when it is acceptable to punch someone who espouses beliefs widely regarded as reprehensible (generally taking the form of the question, “Is it ever acceptable to punch a Nazi?”). In the ensuing discussion, the following popular quote, often attributed to Adolf Hitler, reappeared and recirculated: \nOnly one thing could have stopped our movement – if our adversaries had understood its principle and from the first day smashed with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement. \nAlthough Hitler did say something similar during a speech he made in 1933, this quote is missing some crucial information. For instance, Hitler actually named two things that could have stopped the rise of the Nazi party. The first, as mentioned above, the smashing of the nucleus during the party’s infancy. The second was political indifference. \nThe full quote, translated by the web site Zuriz , can be found in 1934 book containing Hitler’s speeches, titled “ Die Reden Hitlers am Reichsparteitag 1933 “: \n“And so, I established in 1919 a programme and tendency that was a conscious slap in the face of the democratic-pacifist world (…) [We knew] it might take five or ten or twenty years, yet gradually an authoritarian state arose within the democratic state, and a nucleus of fanatical devotion and ruthless determination formed in a wretched world that lacked basic convictions. \nOnly one danger could have jeopardised this development – if our adversaries had understood its principle, established a clear understanding of our ideas, and not offered any resistance. Or, alternatively, if they had from the first day annihilated with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement. \nA similar translation can be found in Daniel Guérin’s 1939 book Fascism and Big Business . \nSo the quote is accurate but incomplete. While Hitler said that the rise of the Nazi party could have been stopped by “smashing the nucleus” on day one, he also noted that resistance from the opposition helped strengthen his movement. \nThe abbreviated version of this quote has been circulating since 1978 when it appeared in David Edgar’s play Destiny .
