Governor Olusegun Mimiko of Ondo State \n“They voluntarily gave up the service and were trained by the state government in various vocational skills to sustain themselves economically and offer them financial empowerment through soft loans,”he stated. \nMimiko pointed out: “The health initiatives would not have been successful without the cooperation of the personnel and stakeholders in the health sector, who zealously helped his administration to achieve the internationally acclaimed progresses.” \nHe asked the personnel and stakeholders to give the incoming All Progressives Congress (APC) government, to be led by Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu maximum support so that the legacies will be sustained. \n“As God has given us the zeal and commitment to achieve all these feats in the health sector, I pray that God will put in the heart of the incoming government to continue with these good works,”he said. \n“Don’t think that Mimiko is no longer the governor, and Dr. Adeyanju is not in charge of the ministry, you all have to cooperate with the incoming government to build on these successes for the benefit of mankind.” \nThe Commissioner for Health, Dr. Dayo Adeyanju said that the Agbebiye Initiative was a “celebration of gains from pains.” \nDr. Adeyanju lauded the outgoing governor for his robust political will to achieve all the hallmark programmes in the health sector and other sectors like education, transportation, urban and rural development.
