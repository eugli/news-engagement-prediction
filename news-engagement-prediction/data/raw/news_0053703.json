Security's sweeping immigration enforcement plan 1 / 45 Back to Gallery The Department of Homeland Security Tuesday released a set of documents to deport the majority of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.\nUndocumented immigrants who commit even minor offenses or traffic violations could be deported.\nTRUMP'S 'SOUTHERN' WHITE HOUSE': Trump spends three consecutive weekend at his vacation property, Mar-a-Lago\nIt implements President Trump's deportation plan through several different measures. Some key points of the memos:\n— More than 10,000 immigration and customs agents will be hired, which will dramatically increase the number of detention facilities.\n— Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement will be required to detain and hold undocumented people caught illegally entering the country, thereby ending the \"catch and release\" practice.\n— An ICE office will be reserved to support families of people killed by undocumented immigrants.\nIt will include people who have been living in this country for up to two years.\n— A program would allow local police officers and sheriff's deputies to operate as immigration agents by helping with deportations.\n— Undocumented immigrants from Central America could be held in Mexico to await hearings, this would likely require Mexico to accept the terms.\n— Instead of informing families of the criminal status of alleged undocumented immigrants, ICE will distribute the information publicly.\n— No directives would affect the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\n\"Department personnel have full authority to arrest or apprehend an alien whom an immigration officers has probable cause to believe is in violation of the immigration laws,\" one memo read. \"They also have full authority to initiate removal proceedings against any alien who is subject to removal under any provision of the (Immigration and Nationality Act).\"\nBORDERING: There's already a border wall; this is what life around it looks like\nThe deportation guidelines signed by DHS secretary John F. Kelly go beyond Obama's plan. His administration focused on hard criminals who had been convicted of serious crimes.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/57/16/23/12379380/3/920x920.jpg",
