This infographic displays some artist's illustrations of how the seven planets orbiting TRAPPIST-1 might appear – including the possible presence of water oceans – alongside some images of the rocky planets in our Solar System. Information about the size and orbital periods of all the planets is also provided for comparison; the TRAPPIST-1 planets are all approximately Earth-sized. NASA \nCompared to the distance between our Sun and its planets, the Trappist-1 family is very tightly bunched. \nIndeed, the dwarf star and its 7 satellites – with orbits ranging from 1.5 to 12 days – would all fit comfortably in the distance between the Sun and its closest planet, Mercury. \nIf Earth were that close to the Sun, it would be a hellish ball of fire. \nBut because Trappist-1 emits far less radiation, temperatures on its planets – depending on the atmosphere – could be between zero and 100 degrees Celsius (32 and 212 degrees Fahrenheit), the scientists said. \nGillon and his team were able to figure out the presence of these planets through observations of events known as transits – when the light of a star dims a bit when an object passes in front of it. \nThe astronomers said that the periodic dips in the light they observed on TRAPPIST-1 indicated that there were objects passing in front of it, as viewed from our vantage point here on Earth. \nFrom this, the researchers were able to \"infer information about their sizes, compositions, and orbits,\" the European Southern Observatory said. \nGillon and his team have started to analyze the chemical make-up of the atmospheres. \n\"There is at least one combination of molecules, if present with relative abundance, that would tell us there is life, with 99% confidence,\" said Gillon. \nA certain mix of methane, oxygen or ozone, and carbon dioxide, for example, could almost certainly come only from biological sources. \n\"But except for detecting a message from beyond our solar system from intelligence out there, we will never be 100% sure,\" he added. \nCrucial step \nThe discovery adds to growing evidence that our home galaxy, the Milky Way, may be populated with tens of billions of worlds not unlike our own – far more than previously suspected. \n\"We have made a crucial step towards finding life out there,\" said co-author Amaury Triaud, a scientist at the University of Cambridge. \n\"Up to now, I don't think we have had the right planets to find out,\" he said in a press briefing.\"Now we have the right target.\" This artistâs impression shows the view from the surface of one of the planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system.

Kornmesser/spaceengine.org \nRemarkably, professional stargazers may simply have been looking in the wrong place. \n\"The great idea of this approach was to study planets around the smallest stars of the galaxy, and close to us,\" said Gillon. \n\"That is something nobody did before us – most astronomers were focused on stars like our Sun,\" he told journalists ahead of publication. \nThe first exoplanet was detected in 1995, but the number has exploded in the last few years. A recent statistical study estimated that there are a trillion in our galaxy alone. \nPrior to this announcement, according to a NASA tally, there are 3,374 known exoplanets. Of those, 1,248 are so-called ice giants, 990 are gas giants, and 775 are \"super Earths\" with masses many times higher than the rock we call home. \nThe closest exoplanet discovered so far is located in Proxima Centauri, the star closest to our own sun. Exoplanet Proxima b's discovery was announced just last year, and it is seen by experts to have potential to support life. – with reports from KD Suarez and Agence France-Presse / Rappler.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:11:00.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
