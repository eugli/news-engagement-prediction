As he did so, he shouted or said ‘white people shouldn’t breed.’” Read more Newborn baby punched in the head after 63yo ‘mistook her for a toy doll’ \nWhen Telford confronted Abdulla, he told her to “shut the f*** up” and walked off, according to the Daily Mail. \nThe baby was said to have been covered in saliva. The spit had been “sprayed around” the baby’s face and a shocked passer-by gave Telford a tissue so that she could clean her baby up. \nThe court heard that Layla-Jean, now almost two, was taken to the doctor for tests after the attack due to fears that she could have contracted TB. \nIn a victim impact statement, Rebecca told police: “I am completely disgusted and distressed that a grown man, regardless of race or religion, would spit on a defenseless baby in a completely unprovoked attack. If he had just walked by I would not have even noticed him, there was no eye contact and no words had been exchanged. I had never seen him before.” \nAbdulla, who has two previous convictions for race-hate attacks on white women, was later tracked down through CCTV. \nOn Tuesday, he was convicted of racially aggravated common assault after a trial at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Court, which he did not attend. \nAbdulla was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for 18 months, with rehabilitation and mental health treatment requirements. \nSince last January’s attack, Abdulla has spent time receiving psychiatric treatment in hospital. The judge said “society in general” would be better served if Abdulla was allowed to continue his psychiatric treatment program.
