Members Sign In Here’s a map of the Patriots parade route By Jaclyn Reiss and Mark Arsenault Globe Staff February 06, 2017 \nThe city of Boston will hold a victory parade on Tuesday to celebrate the Patriots’ comeback Super Bowl victory. \nHere’s everything you need to know about the parade. \nWhat time does the parade start? \nThe parade will begin at 11 a.m. \nWhat’s the weather going to be like? \nExuberant Patriots fans planning to attend should dress warmly and bring an umbrella, as bone-chilling rain is on the way. \nThe weather will be wet and raw, with temperatures in the 30s as the parade gets underway Tuesday at 11 a.m., according to Dave Epstein . \nMayor Martin J. Walsh and Police Commissioner William B. Evans encouraged fans to dress in warm layers, with waterproof shoes and an outer shell if possible. \nWhere does the route begin and end? \nThe parade starts at the Hynes Convention Center and travels down Boylston Street, around Boston Common to Tremont, and then ends at City Hall Plaza. \nHere’s a closer look at the route: \nHow should revelers plan to get there? \nThe MBTA will run at rush-hour levels of service throughout the event. However, the Government Center T station will close temporarily at 9:30 a.m. through the end of the parade, according to the MBTA’s website . \nFor those driving in, be warned: The parade route’s roads will be closed off beginning at 9 a.m., and parking is expected to be sparse. Those roads are expected to open up shortly after the parade passes, based on how quickly the crowd disperses and on the area’s cleanup efforts. Boylston Street is expected to reopen first, followed by Tremont Street and Cambridge Street, according to Boston police . \nFor those who live in the city, several streets will have parking restrictions as of midnight Tuesday, including parts of Boylston Street, Cambridge Street, Tremont Street, and Congress Street, among others. Towing in the restricted areas will begin 6 a.m. Tuesday, according to Boston police. What will the parade consist of? \nThe parade will feature 22 duck boats, five flatbed trucks, two photo trucks, and four confetti trucks, according to Walsh’s office. \nThere have been a lot of championship parades recently, right? \nIn the past 15 years or so, Beantown has been a mecca for welcoming champion athletes home. Since 2000, the Patriots have won five Super Bowls: 2002, 2004, 2005, 2015 and 2017; the Red Sox have won three World Series, in 2004, 2007, 2013; the Celtics won the NBA Finals in 2008; and the Bruins captured the Stanley Cup in 2011.
