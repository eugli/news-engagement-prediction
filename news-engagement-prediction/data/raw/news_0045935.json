It's going to be an adventure,\" he gushed, later adding, \"We've sort of embraced it all…with arms wide open.\" Photos \nGeorge Clooney's Best Roles \nGeorge also dished on how his \"supportive\" pals reacted when he told them the news. \n\"It got really quiet,\" he recalled. \"And they all just started making baby crying noises, and the whole table just busted up laughing.\" David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for Netflix \nOf course, the jokes come into play regarding George's age (most of his friends have kids who are grown up and off to college). However, the actor brushes the them off and looks to people like 89-year-old Jean-Paul Belmondo for inspiration. The French actor welcomed a child with his second wife, Nathalie Tardivel , in 2003 when he was 70-years-old. \n\"So, I'm feeling a little better about being 56 by the time [the twins come],\" Clooney laughed. \nMeanwhile, George's mother, Nina Clooney , is so excited about her soon-to-be grandbabies that she accidentally revealed the twins' sexes. \n\"It will be one of each! Yes, a boy and a girl. That's what I've been told,\" she told Vogue magazine last weekend, in an interview that was shared on Thursday. \"How marvelous!\" she added. \"My husband and I are extremely excited.\" \nCongrats again to the expecting couple!
