Somalia's rocky road to democracy \nThe elections are seen as part of a lengthy and complex process to help the East African state rebuild its democracy and achieve stability. \nMore than 20,000 African Union (AU) troops are stationed in Somalia to prevent militant Islamist group al-Shabab from overthrowing the weak government. \nOver 20 candidates are vying to become president, with the top three proceeding to a second round of voting and the top two from that round going forward to a third and final vote. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Most businesses and schools have been shut for the vote \nThe election hall is a converted aircraft hangar, and is packed with MPs, reports the BBC's Ferdinand Omondi from the venue. \nPresident Hassan Sheikh Mohamud is standing for re-election and analysts say he is likely to be one of those who goes forward to the later rounds. \nThe airport is viewed as the most secure site and voting was moved there from a police academy because of growing security concerns. \nOn Tuesday evening, suspected Al-Shabab militants launched a series of attacks, with two mortar rounds fired close to the venue where the voting venue. \nResidents in Arbacow village outside Mogadishu say jihadists attacked an AU base there. Media caption A 60-second guide to the unique way Somalia is electing its new president \nAl-Shabab has a presence in much of the southern third of the country and has previously attacked the Somali parliament, presidential palace, courts, hotels and the fortified airport zone. \nAt least 19 politicians, as well as many civilians and soldiers, have been killed in its assaults. \nWednesday's security measures include a ban on flights to and from Mogadishu airport. \nCorrespondents said most schools and offices remained open on Tuesday but people had had to walk to reach their destination. \nAnalysts say holding the election in the airport environment may also reduce the possibility of vote buying or other corruption in the election process.
