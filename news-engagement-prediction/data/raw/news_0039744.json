Pizza delivery driver leaves note offering 'weed, MDMA, pills, ket, raw coke & much more' \nHe said: ‘After using the product for a few days, my head started to become dry and itchy. When I looked in the mirror, I was horrified and my hair was falling out in clumps. \n‘I have used the product in the past and didn’t have any issues, but I bought a new pot in January and started using it again. \n‘I used the putty to spike my hair up in the centre, and that’s the part of my scalp that has been directly affected.

I went to my doctor who gave me a moisturising shampoo but that didn’t help. \n‘I have since been prescribed another moisturiser to treat any infection and help to reduce the stinging.’ \nHe has since contacted Unilever – who own VO5 – which has now started an investigation. \nLee claims VO5 have now offered him £210 to settle the case however he has turned down the offer. \nLee said: ‘I want to get to the bottom of this and find out exactly what was in the product, I need to know what has caused it in order to get the problem treated. Seagull caught stealing people's parking tickets \n‘Certain staff have been very helpful, but others have laughed when I mentioned the issue. \n‘I have even had an allergy test to prove I am not allergic to anything, it’s just so strange. \n‘I’ve never had any problems with my scalp before. \n‘The skin on my scalp has now started to peel off which sometimes causes it to bleed, and I now have to moisturise my head three times a day. \n‘I am forced to constantly wear a hat to cover up my head which is really embarrassing, and when I do take it off people stare.’ \nA spokesman for Unilever, said: ‘As we have not had any other complaints about our product, we would welcome the opportunity to investigate further. \n‘As a company the safety and quality of our products is our top priority and we have been in touch with Lee to arrange for the return of the product so that we can continue our investigation and test the product in question.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:36:01.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
