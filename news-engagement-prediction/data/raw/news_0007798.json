As it turns out, the segment was pre-recorded; an Intel spokesperson told USA Today that the decision was made not to execute the sequence live because of possible weather and environmental conditions. \n“In February, you don’t know what it will be like during Super Bowl day,” said Intel Drones General Manager Natalie Cheung. “We’d hate to plan all this and, if the wind speeds are too high or if it’s raining and the roof is closed, no one can see this spectacular show. So our creative team as well as the Super Bowl creative team felt this would be best to be filmed.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:44:59.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
