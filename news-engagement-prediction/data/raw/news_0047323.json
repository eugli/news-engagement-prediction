In July 2016, he photographed from above the melt lakes, which accumulate on top.\nA host of factors make it difficult to estimate exactly how fast Greenland is melting ( a question for which NASA hopes to have an answer in a few years ). But what is clear is that the overall melt of the ice sheet is a major contributor to the rising of the ocean.\n“Thaw” is on exhibit at Bonhams in London from Feb. 20-23.\n\n“Thaw #11.” (Timo Lieber) \n“Thaw #3.” (Timo Lieber) \n“Thaw #9.” (Timo Lieber) \n“Thaw #2.” (Timo Lieber) \n“Thaw #5.” (Timo Lieber) More In Sight: \nWhat life is like living with a ‘love doll’ in Japan \nThese photos show what the U.S.-Mexican border looked like about 80 years ago \nTurning ordinary into magical: Amateur photographer presents new look at life in India \n  Share on Facebook Share   Share on Twitter Tweet 0 Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:07:59.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
