Please liaise with the head of supplies chain management for them to clarify on these issues and reply to us urgently to enable CBK to release the money to the beneficiaries using the NYS letterhead,” the letter said. \nDIRECT HAND IN SCANDAL \nBy demanding that Ms Waiguru discloses her knowledge of or association with Ms Ng’ang’a, Mr Odinga seeks to establish the former CS’s direct hand in the scandal. \nMs Waiguru has consistently defended herself against claims that she had a direct role in the scandal. \nOver time, Ms Waiguru has been able to shake off the scandal and emerge as a frontrunner in the race for the Kirinyaga gubernatorial seat. \nIn the affidavit, Mr Odinga also wants Ms Waiguru to state the basic salary she earned while serving in the Kibaki and Kenyatta governments between 2006 and November 2015 when she resigned over the NYS scandal. \nThe information should cover Ms Waiguru’s stint as the director of the much-maligned Integrated Financial Management Information System (Ifmis), the Head of the Economic Stimulus Programme, the head of governance at Treasury and as technical adviser to the government. \nMr Odinga also wants Ms Waiguru to disclose whether she acquired any investments in real estate during the period and whether she traded in any shares at the Nairobi Stock Exchange. He also wants Ms Waiguru to disclose her bank accounts and the amount of money in each account. \nMr Odinga also wants the former CS to disclose whether she has foreign accounts and, if so, in which countries. \nHe also wants her to state her average monthly personal expenditure and whether she has any dependants, and how much she spends on each.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:24:46.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
