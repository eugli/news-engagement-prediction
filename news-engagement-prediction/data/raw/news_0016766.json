While some of the money is used for maintenance, product development and charity training, accounts allegedly show that more than £10million was spent on staff costs last year. \nThis reportedly includes an average salary of more than £60,000 for some directors, sales and administration workers, while the boss of the firm is said to have earned an estimated £198,000, an investigation by the Daily Mail found. I understand they have to cover their overheads, but half of the money is going on wages Ashley Fulwood, the chief executive of OCD-UK \nT he website, which has millions of registered users, was last night labelled greedy by one charity chief executive. The Telegraph has contacted JustGiving for comment. \nAshley Fulwood, the chief executive of OCD-UK, a small charity that provides information on OCD and similar conditions, told the paper his fees had increased last year by more than £300. \n“I understand they have to cover their overheads, but half of the money is going on wages,\" he said. “They are taking people's hard-earned money for themselves. It is greed. It is hard to stomach.” \nInformation about JustGiving’s fees are accessible on its website. It shows that if a £10 donation is made including Gift Aid , which takes it up to £12.50, then the total amount taken from the charity would be around 0.76p. \nThis includes the website’s five per cent fee amounting to 0.63p and a card processing fee, usually at 1.3 per cent or 0.13p. @JustGiving really disappointed to find out today for donations you receive you guys take 6% of that sum, raking in 20 million a year — zam (@zammo70) February 7, 2017 \nT he information states: “Charities pay a five per cent fee on each donation made through the site, with partner charities that raise large volumes paying as little as two per cent. The service is free for individuals. \n“Charities can either pay a subscription fee of £15 or £39 (depending on usage) for access to a sophisticated suite of reporting tools, support and training, or use the free option called the 'Start' plan, which enables them to start a Campaign at no cost. \n“JustGiving reinvests all of its surpluses into product development, innovation, charity training and support, in keeping with JustGiving's mission to ensure that no good cause goes unfunded.” \nA spokesman for the website told the Mail that fundraisers chose the site because “we help them raise more, net of fees”. \n“Our small fee is systematically reinvested into creating the services and technologies that help good causes raise more money, and our investors have never taken a penny out of the business,” they said. \n“As a company, we have helped raise far more money for good causes than lower-cost or free options, which offer a poor service through lack of investment and let charities and users down as a result.” Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T16:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T11:52:01.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
