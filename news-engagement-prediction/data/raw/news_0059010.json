Instead, he was told to attend a safer driving course. \nThe King’s College London researcher told the Standard: “I think the safe driving course is fine but I think there should be more punishment for people who drive badly, not just the ones who cause gratuitous harm. She was knocked over by the van when it changed lanes suddenly \n“The statement I got back from the police said unless you have life-threatening injuries or you are dead, we don’t prosecute. I believe that that is completely ludicrous. London driving has got so bad, not just cars but buses, vans and cyclists, that unless people are forced to show some respect it’s not going to change.” \nThe incident comes to light days after new cycling tsar Will Norman said cycling in London was “safe” and said more attention needed to be focused on pedestrian deaths. \nSome cycle campaigners reacted angrily, saying cyclists were more at risk. TfL confirmed that the cyclist death and serious injury rate was 2.6 times higher than that for pedestrians. \nMs Singh, from Brixton, passed details of the collision to the Standard after reading about last week’s inquest into the death of NHS physiotherapist Esther Hartsilver, who was killed by a HGV as she cycled to work in Denmark Hill in 2015. \nMs Singh said she had endured six months of frustration in dealing with the Met and the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime, the City Hall overseer. Nisha Singh, 33, is furious no charges were brought against the driver (Jeremy Selwyn) \nHer incident happened at Lambeth roundabout on July 22 last year as she cycled from St Thomas’s hospital to the Maudsley hospital in Denmark Hill. \nShe suffered bleeding, bruising and a black eye. She said it was only because a black cab was following at distance that it was able to avoid running her over as she lay in the road. Lorry driver 'cut left on roundabout, killing arts visionary' \nKaren Stuart, the Met official in charge of considering traffic offences in Lambeth, told her: “The National Driver Alertness Course is the first option that is offered to drivers where there is evidence of driving without due care. \n“A course would not be offered if the matter involved a life-threatening or life-changing injury. Unfortunately we cannot offer both the driving course and also summons the driver to court.” \nMs Singh said she felt the police would have believed the driver’s claim that the collision was her fault if it were not for the video footage, which was recorded by a rear-facing camera. \n“He said I was trying to overtake him, which makes absolutely no sense - I would have had to have been cycling like Superwoman. I was ahead of him the whole time.” \nA Met police spokeswoman said: “The injuries and standard of driving are all taken into consideration.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:51:42.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
