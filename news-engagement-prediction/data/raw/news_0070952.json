Justice must prevail and Wayne must be reinstated to the subs' bench.' \nTwitter user Guido Fawkes , who has over 220k followers, started this petition which will be eventually delivered to Sutton United Football Club. \nA number of Twitter users have already come out and supported the petition after Shaw was forced to leave Sutton yesterday.
