More recently in 2015, a fire broke out at Ang Mo Kio MRT station. No injuries were reported in both cases.\n\nLTA advised passengers to immediately alert the train driver via the train intercom system if there is a fire on the train so that the driver can inform the Operation Control Centre. The OCC is notified automatically when incidents occur on driverless trains, such as those used on the Circle Line. \n\nPassengers should follow instructions given by the operator and exit the train in an orderly manner, LTA said, adding that if fire or smoke was found in the train tunnel, the operators would alert the SCDF immediately and route affected trains to the nearest station.\n- CNA/mz\nEmail More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T15:04:39.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
