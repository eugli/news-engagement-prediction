To groans in the House, he referenced Tory MP Enoch Powell – a vociferous opponent of mass immigration. Belgians demand free trade to sell us chocs Makers of Belgian chocolate (pictured) are terrified of having to pay tariffs to export to the huge British market Our love of Belgian beer and chocolate could influence how Brexit unfolds, it has emerged. Belgian brewers and chocolatiers are lobbying their government to ensure negotiations with the European Union unfold without punitive terms imposed on Britain. They are worried that their exports could fall victim to massive trade penalties. Belgian exports to Britain, which also include frozen chips, medicine, fruit and textiles, are worth £27 billion a year to the nation, which has a population of just 11 million. The country's Brexit High Level Group said exporters feared a disastrous slump in sales if negotiations turned sour. The group has handed a report to Belgian premier Charles Michel, calling for an 'ambitious' free trade agreement. Mr Michel, who has been unsympathetic to the Brexit movement, said his government would seek to reduce the impact of Britain's departure from the EU on Belgian jobs. Belgium's government tends to follow the European Commission, which has taken a hard line on the deal Britain can expect after Article 50 is triggered. The report was ordered by Belgium's economy minister Kris Peeters and was compiled by the National Bank of Belgium and the Belgian Employers' Federation. He said: 'He probably would find it amazing to believe that his party have become Eurosceptic and rather mildly anti-immigrant in a very strange way in 2016.' Opening the debate on the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, Mr Davis said: 'We asked the people of the UK if they wanted to leave the European Union; they decided they did. So at the core of this Bill lies a very simple question: do we trust the people or not?' He said the 'eyes of the nation' were on the Commons, adding: 'For many years, there has been a creeping sense in the country... that politicians say one thing, and do another. 'We voted to give the people the chance to determine our future in a referendum. Now we must honour our side of the agreement: to vote to deliver on the result.' Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that for Labour, the Bill was 'very difficult'. But he added: 'The notion that the referendum was merely a consultation exercise to inform Parliament holds no water.' Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Nick Clegg was heckled by Tory MPs when he said the House had a 'duty' to vote against the Bill. He said doing so would force ministers to 'come back to this House with a more sensible and moderate approach to Brexit.' SNP spokesman Stephen Gethins accused the Government of 'a lack of respect' for devolution. All 54 SNP MPs will vote against the Bill tomorrow. Leading Tory Eurosceptics accused opponents of the Bill of being 'anti-democratic'. Mr Gove attacked the Lib Dems, saying: 'It is a tragedy that the party which is called Liberal Democrat is scarcely liberal and now anti-democratic.' Opponents of Brexit were 'seeking obfuscation, delay and a dilution of the democratic mandate of the British people', he added. And Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg accused Remain campaigners of a 'shocking, outrageous and monstrous hypocrisy'. What a U-turn! Top City lobbyists back Brexit One of the City's most influential lobby groups has ditched its pro-EU message, instead hailing Brexit as an 'unprecedented opportunity' to boost global trade. In a dramatic U-turn, TheCityUK said Brexit presented a once-in-a-generation opportunity for a rethink of our commercial relationships with the rest of the world. In the run-up to last year's EU referendum, the group warned of the devastating consequences Brexit would unleash on Britain's economy and its powerhouse financial services sector. It said up to 70,000 jobs could be lost and formulated plans for how companies could cope. But in a report this week, the group launched a withering attack on Brussels – describing EU membership as a 'straitjacket' which had hampered Britain's ability to forge lucrative relationships with non-EU nations. This is because Brussels imposes tariffs on goods imported from outside the EU. TheCityUK's director of policy and strategy, Gary Campkin, said: 'An area of opportunity in leaving the EU is ... for the first time in forty-plus years to have an independent trade and investment policy.' Just one in four MPs believe Britain must leave Europe's single market after Brexit Only a quarter of MPs believe the UK must leave the European single market to honour the referendum vote for Brexit, according to a new survey. MPs view imposing immigration controls and ending UK contributions to the European Union budgets as more important factors in implementing the referendum result. Nearly six in ten MPs questioned, including 71 per cent of Conservatives and 57 per cent of Labour members, said they would not consider Britain to have really left the EU if foreign nationals continued to have the right to live and work in the UK. Some 35 per cent said that leaving the EU would have to involve Britain ceasing payments into the EU budget and 26 per cent said it would require quitting the single market. MPs view imposing immigration controls and ending UK contributions to the European Union budgets as more important factors in implementing the referendum result Only 5 per cent, including 10 per cent of Tories but none of the Labour MPs questioned, thought the referendum result meant EU nationals currently living in Britain could not be allowed to stay. The survey, by the UK in a Changing Europe think tank and London's Queen Mary University, found that MPs who voted Leave 'want to control immigration at all costs', while Remainers were far more divided over their priorities. Half of MPs believe Parliament should have a vote on the final deal with the EU, but there is little appetite for a further referendum, which is backed by just 13 per cent of MPs, the survey found. All of the Leave-backing MPs interviewed for the study said they were optimistic that the UK will quickly sign trade deals with major powers such as China after quitting the EU, and 86 per cent think the deals will more than compensate for any loss of trade with the EU. By contrast, just a quarter of MPs who backed Remain think there will be swift post-Brexit trade deals, and 71 per cent say that any deals that are struck will not make up for the loss in EU trade. Sixteen per cent of MPs said former prime minister David Cameron's renegotiation of the UK's EU membership made them more likely to vote to Leave than said it had the intended effect of making them more favourable to the Remain side (12 per cent) Some 44 per cent of MPs questioned expected the UK's general economic condition to get worse over the next year, compared to 22 per cent who said it would improve. This contrasts starkly with the position before last year's referendum, when more than 50 per cent expected improvement over the coming 12 months. Among Remain-backing MPs, just 8 per cent expect the economy to improve over the next year and 36 per cent over the coming decade, while 55 per cent of Leavers expect improvement over the next 12 months and 97 per cent over 10 years. Looking back to last year's referendum campaign, only 3 per cent of MPs said that it encouraged them to support more public votes of this type. Some 69 per cent said they had expected Remain to win the vote, against just 22 per cent who correctly predicted victory for Brexit. And more MPs (16 per cent) said former prime minister David Cameron's renegotiation of the UK's EU membership made them more likely to vote to Leave than said it had the intended effect of making them more favourable to the Remain side (12 per cent). Ipsos Mori questioned 101 MPs, including 48 Conservatives, 43 Labour, seven SNP and three others, between October 31 and December 21.
