He had a great sense of humour, always knew how to make someone laugh,” Stuart Beck said about his dad in an interview with WFLA . “He always had a smile on his face and he made the whole room happy.” \nREAD MORE: Man accused of selling fake Justin Bieber tickets facing charges \n“We love him so much, and he’s going to be so missed,” family friend Christina Finnell told WFLA. “The world is a much worse place, darker place now that he’s gone … why would you devastate a family like this for a motorcycle?” \nStuart added that the bike was a gift from his slain father. \n“I got it as a Christmas present and I worshipped it, because it came from my dad,” he said. “He taught me how to ride. It started as his hobby and moved on to mine.” \nREAD MORE: Surveillance video shows Craigslist killer preparing home for victims \nFinnell hopes the incident will serve as a warning for other Craigslist users. \n“[I] never realized the inherent danger that could be in that, and I know Jimmy didn’t either,” she said. \nCraigslist does provide a list of recommendations for users on their website , but assures “the incidence of violent crime related to Craigslist is extremely low.” \nThe classified site urges buyers and sellers to “insist on a public meeting place like a cafe, bank, or shopping centre” and to always “trust your instincts.” \nThe 17-year-old suspect has been charged with first-degree felony murder, robbery, and discharge of a firearm in public, while the 16-year-old accused faces first-degree murder and robbery charges. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
