My whole, my family… we've all being through a difficult time. My focus is my children, our children and my focus is finding this way through. We are and forever will be a family. I am coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer.\" \nJolie, who was in Cambodia to premiere and promote her new directorial effort First They Killed My Father , continued about how she and the kids were coping — along with their pets — in how to find a normal rhythm amid all the chaos. \nShe said: \n\"It's been a difficult few months. Right now, I'm going through a moment when just everybody's in my room. Two dogs, two hamsters and two children at the moment. It's wonderful. But, usually, I just wake up trying to figure out who's going to get [the] dog out, who's going to start the pancakes and did anybody brush their teeth.\" \nLOLz!! \nObviously it's a serious time in her life, and a serious thing to go through — but the humor she can find in it (and the relatability!) is truly refreshing, too. \nJolie continued, to, and got reflective about her children, and what she hopes they get out of their lives as they grow old, too. \nShe said: \n\"At that stage, I hope just standing. In five years' time I would like to be traveling around the world visiting my children, hoping that they're just happy and doing really interesting things, and I imagine in many different parts of the world, and I'll be supporting them. Everything I do I hope is that I represent something, and I represent the right things to my children, and give them the right sense of what they're capable of, and the world as it should be seen. Not through the prism of Hollywood or through a certain kind of life, but really take them into the world, where they have a really good sense and become rounded people.\" \nAwww!!! \nIt's a tough time, and a stressful place in life to go through a divorce like this, but Angelina is approaching it just as you'd expect: with grace, class, civility, love, and yes, a little bit of humor. \nGood for her! \n[ Image via Apega/ WENN . ] A History Of Hollywood Whitewashing!
