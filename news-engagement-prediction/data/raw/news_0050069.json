That all went out the window in 2015, the year \"the period went public.\" Female elected officials and activists began to focus their attention on the tampon tax (which is a state issue); I turned my attention to how I could help women across the country.", "external_links": ["https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.amny.com_news_new-2Dyork-2Dcity-2Dto-2Dbecome-2Dfirst-2Dto-2Dprovide-2Dfree-2Dtampons-2Dand-2Dsanitary-2Dproducts-2Dto-2Dstudents-2D1.11573642&d=DwMFAg&c=B73tqXN8Ec0ocRmZHMCntw&r=xtfAIkID0wM1Qj_2sCXTDsweBqrsruR0zY5YwUFi44g&m=ujWQ02J_SL3FVAQQEgmDr1JiRMRgRS-3nGsCEkH9SmE&s=1YuIkq2xqetr_Xoq386yYZFVmWtxicEc69GwP6nKtr8&e=", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/mac.h-cdn.co/assets/17/07/1487336641-img-4531.jpeg?crop=1.0xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/mac.h-cdn.co/assets/17/07/1487336641-img-4531.jpeg?crop=1.0xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"], "published": "2017-02-21T13:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:06:02.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
