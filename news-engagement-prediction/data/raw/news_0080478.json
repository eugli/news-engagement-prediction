Millie-Grace Atkinson (left), pictured with her sisters Alisha (centre) and Finty (right), received racist and threatening texts Mr Sheridan admits to sending the texts but claims he only reacted because his own daughter received a string of nuisance calls from Millie-Grace and her friends while she was off school with a broken leg. Ms Turner said: 'Millie-Grace walks to school with the man's daughter and they had been involved in a typical incident of pre-teen banter. 'My daughter had been messaging this girl and she had been messaging back, but this man got hold of his daughter's phone [to get Millie-Grace's number] and in the space of one day she had received 17 text messages from him. 'He threatened me and Millie's dad with physical violence. I text him and said I had saved the messages and that I would be reporting it to the police. 'I've put up with this kind of racism my whole life but my children haven't developed the skills to brush it off yet. 'It's important to know that because Millie-Grace is on the autistic spectrum, she often corrects people's grammar. She isn't being rude. 'When my daughter asked if it was ever okay for a grown man to call someone the \"n\" word, I thought she had just heard some rap music, but when she said her friend's dad had been texting her, I was like \"what\"?!' The mother-of-three immediately took her daughter's phone and discovered texts sent by Dean Sheridan 'I'm not personally afraid because I have had verbal and physical abuse before and I had to deal with it, but I am afraid for my kids. It is hard and I feel intimidated.' In the texts, which were sent over the course of a day, Mr Sheridan asks Millie-Grace 'ask your mum when she gets in from work is [sic] the tramp works if your dad was a \"n****r\" and \"are you black because you tex [sic] like black people talk\". Ms Turner said: 'You just don't expect that behaviour from a grown adult. It is the fact that a grown man thinks it is OK to text a 12-year-old girl. 'Why would you put yourself in that situation? I'm a great advocate of free speech but when it becomes an issue that makes someone fearful, then it is wrong. 'I like to think generally people are good and don't hold these beliefs. 'It was just a bit of a fall out between two young girls but for the man to refer to me as a 'bike' and a prostitute and make reference to my daughter supposedly not knowing who her dad is, that isn't right. Nobody can get their head around it. Millie-Grace had been involved in what Ms Turner called an 'incident of pre-teen banter' with another girl in her school year who she walked home with 'This has been reported to the police and a sergeant is investigating two cases of racist abuse against both me and my daughter.' The issue, which occurred last Tuesday, has sparked outrage on Facebook with users expressing their disgust at Mr Sheridan. But he claims the texts were in response to an incident that had caused his own family pain and distress. Mr Sheridan, who runs a haulage company, claimed that aside from his racist remarks, he was trying to protect his daughter like any other father. He said: 'My little girl is off school at the moment. She's been off for five weeks with a fractured leg and all she's been getting is harassed by her and her cronies. 'What would you do to protect your daughter? We've just had the results back [from an MRI scan] on Friday and we were concerned that she had bone cancer. She has fractured her leg for no reason whatsoever. Me Sheridan claimed that aside from his racist remarks, he was trying to protect his daughter like any other father 'You can imagine the stuff we have been going through and then she's been getting little s***s phoning her, hassling her down the phone, calling her names on withheld numbers and it's all down to this little girl called Millie. 'She is getting lads to call her and everything, so when lads get involved, dad gets involved. Yes, I've made some racial remarks regarding it. 'But I'm not going to take any of this regarding my daughter anymore. We still don't know why my daughter's leg was fractured. 'I'm certainly not going through all this with brats calling my daughter's phone and making threats and calling her names. 'I'll do anything, and I mean anything, to protect my daughter. If anyone has a problem, they can come and see me. I'll do anything to protect my daughter.' A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said today: 'There's not a great deal that we can say about this as it is an ongoing investigation. 'The report was about the sending of distressing messages and it is being investigated. 'The report refers to a period between midnight on February 21 and 3pm on February 27. 'Anyone with any information, please contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.'
