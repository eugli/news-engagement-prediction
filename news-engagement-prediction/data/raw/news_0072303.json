The suit was filed in California district court. \nWaymo alleges that former employee Anthony Levandowski downloaded thousands of confidential files to a personal hard drive before resigning from the company. Levandowski then launched a self-driving truck company, Otto, which Uber purchased in 2016. Waymo also claims that other former employees now with Uber also downloaded confidential information. \nRelated: Uber pleads with users deleting app: 'We're hurting' \nWaymo pursued the lawsuit after receiving an inadvertent email from a supplier that included a drawing of Uber's LIDAR circuit board. LIDAR is a type of laser sensor that is generally considered essential to developing a self-driving car. According to Waymo, the drawing of the circuit board had a striking resemblance to Waymo's own LIDAR. \nWaymo notes that its engineers have spent thousands of hours developing the sensor, and it spent millions in the process. \n\"We didn't make this decision lightly,\" wrote Waymo, whose parent company Alphabet ( GOOGL , Tech30 ) is also an Uber investor through its Google Ventures arm. \"However, given the overwhelming facts that our technology has been stolen, we have no choice but to defend our investment and development of this unique technology.\" \nRelated: Your car's data may soon be more valuable than the car itself \nThe intense race to build self-driving cars has heated up lately. Waymo isn't the first to file a lawsuit involving a former employee and trade secrets. Earlier this year, Tesla sued the former director of its own self-driving car project, who left to launch his own startup. \nUber said in a statement that it takes the allegations seriously and will review the matter carefully.
