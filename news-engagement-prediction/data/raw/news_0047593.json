No need to walk a long way wearing heavy boots while carrying skis or board, or chivvy everyone onto a crowded bus. \nWhile many ski resorts have some slope-side places to stay, it’s usually those that are purpose-built high in the mountains for easy access to the snow that can truly be considered ski-in/ski-out. And while other countries may boast a few such places, France is their spiritual home. \nMany purpose-built French resorts were constructed in the Sixties, with austere-looking buildings intended, it’s said, to reflect their rocky surroundings. Often designed by famed architects of the time – most of Flaine by the Hungarian-born modernist Marcel Breuer for example, and Avoriaz by a trio of French innovators lead by Jacques Labro – their look fell out of favour in following decades. best ski resorts in france \nRecently, however, new and equally convenient villages of chalet-style apartments have grown up in purpose-built resorts such as Tignes, Flaine and Les Menuires, and some of the old blocks – such as Labro’s Dromonts hotel in Avoriaz and Breuer’s Totem hotel in Flaine - have had makeovers. \nSecurely snowy, promising streets that are reliably clad in white, ski-in/ski-out resorts have a clear appeal for everyone, not just families. \nPrices are per person based on two people sharing a double or twin room half board for seven nights, including flights and transfers, unless stated otherwise. Chalet board means half board plus afternoon tea and wine with dinner. Avoriaz, France Best for: Terrain parks \nThis purpose-built resort above Morzine in the massive French/Swiss Portes du Soleil ski area was largely the brainchild of French racer Jean Vuarnet, better known for his sunglasses than for his gold medal at the Squaw Valley Olympics in 1960. Accommodation is mainly ski-in/ski-out apartments, many of which have been renovated in recent years. Avoriaz has a quirky charm and a varied array of terrain parks – five plus a superpipe.

Facilities have come a long way since then. You can learn first turns at the Chapelle park, which has kicker lines from green to red along with boxes and rails, before progressing to the pro lines and the airbag in the Arare park. \nIn the Stash park all features are made from wood and there are three lines of varying difficulty snaking through the forest. The idea originated with Jake Burton, founder of Burton Snowboards. Avoriaz also has two parks especially for kids, Lil’Stash with wooden features, and the Burton Kids Parkway. Explore further afield \nThe Portes du Soleil’s variety of slopes suits everyone from beginners to veteran powderhounds, and Avoriaz makes a good base for easy access to all of it. High and rocky, the resort is a great destination in a good snow year, less so when the snow is thin on the lower slopes. Where to stay \nThe ski-in/ski-out Dromonts is the hotel exception to the apartment rule, a throwback to the days of Depardieu and Deneuve that offers plenty of retro chic – a little like having a walk-on part in a Truffaut film.
