What were they thinking? \nMy favourite magazine, Prospect, from the UK, marks 2016 as \"the graveyard of orthodoxy\". \nHere in Australia, we're supposedly witnessing an historic shift to non-mainstream parties — though I'm waiting to see what actually happens when the only polls that count take place. Listen as Cameron adviser Craig Oliver tells Saturday Extra why the Remain campaign failed. \nBut might the decline of trade union newsletters and Catholic solidarity, delivered with mothers' milk in the old Irish tribal days, have been the undertakers of orthodoxy in Australia? \nMy childhood and formation in the post-war decades were marked by two strong institutions in community life: trade unions, to which around 40 per cent of workers belonged, and the Catholic Church, which was the identity base for my parents and the country's single biggest religious persuasion. \nLabour relations regularly hit the front page when I covered the industrial rounds in WA in 1973-74. \nI learned that the trade union newsletter (or journal) was much more than a rabble-rousing chronicle or loud-hailer alerting \"the bruvvers\" to the next likely strike. \nIt was observably about member education. Most unions had their own version. \nThe editorship was seen as an auspicious job. His (and they were almost always men) role was to supervise a broader perspective than merely the workplace, including inculcating union members in the art of politics.

(Getty Images: Alain Nogues) \nYes, there were predictable diatribes about rapacious bosses and their dastardly plans to advance capital and disadvantage the worker, with a consequent call to \"stand together\", invariably delivered in thundering bold type. \nBut alongside these were often surprising introductions to social issues facing distant sets of workers, encouraging a sense of international labour solidarity. I believe this played a considerable role in countering the lazy, look-at-moi, small-minded prejudice that is so common on social media. \nAnother feature was discussion about the relative merits of the different political party approaches in relation to labour: why deals might need to be done, why a medium-term approach to a seemingly intractable problem might be the wiser option rather than a straightforward kick-in-the-pants for an incumbent government (especially if the party in power was Labor). \nAmid the stridency, I remember discussions about trade-offs and sensible tactics to secure conditions like penalty rates and holiday loading, to compensate workers who lost regular overtime money during their leave. Saturday Extra hears how Australia grappled with the politics of conscription during World War I. \nThere was some subtlety, in my recollection, and plenty of civic education on the ebb and flow of democratic possibilities in these usually once-a-month or once-a-quarter outlets. Might we be feeling their absence now, rather more than we have grasped? \nSimilarly, the use of politics to advance the Catholic tribe's interests was once a given, going right back to the heady days of the WWI conscription debates and beyond. \nIrish-Australians in the late 19th and early 20th centuries understood their ghetto role and fixed on education and political advancement as the way off the bottom rung. \nAnd boy did they succeed: just count the number of Catholics who have starred in our politics, especially with the ALP. \nPerhaps these two institutions introduced to my generation the notion that democracy gave you the right to choose — a huge privilege — but that this has to be exercised prudently, involving conscious assent and the precious right to dissent, though carefully. \nWe were warned not to be cavalier about taking risks, because conditions could have gone pear-shaped for emerging minority groups like the Irish.

The beauty of our system is that this does not happen at the point of a gun. \nBut I would suggest the voters of the past were encouraged to weigh-up the competing gains and losses embodied by the policies and personalities angling for their vote. I think people wrestled with their vote more. \nCraig Oliver, head of communications for former British prime minister David Cameron during the Brexit campaign, told me recently on RN's Saturday Extra that he thought people voted more emotionally these days, de-horsed from ritual party engagement. \nHe quoted British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's pithy summary from 10 days after the July vote. \n\"So what was it about? People's emotions matter even when they don't seem wholly rational,\" Johnson said. \n\"There is, among a section of the population, a kind of hysteria, a contagious mourning of the kind that I remember in 1997 after the death of the Princess of Wales. It is not about the EU, of course.\" \nThe American political analyst David Runciman told Phillip Adams on Late Night Live last year that he believes Trump supporters were not trying to torpedo their Beltway and government institutions, as many analysts suggested. \nRather, they inherently trusted that the institutions were strong enough to survive somehow, and that therefore it was safe to cast a straight protest vote. Arguably, that didn't go so well. \nEven when politics and politicians infuriate and deserve to take a hit, imagining that magic solutions exist and that our anger is entirely righteous is surely self-serving and quite possibly dangerous. \nPausing before you vote to weigh up whether things could get worse rather than better takes a little bit of discipline, certainly. \nCatholic and worker solidarity helped many Australians do it in the past, and their decline has left us more uninhibited. \nWith apologies to Julia Gillard, this doesn't explain everything, but it probably explains something about our current political venting and impulsive blurting. \nTo hear from expert commentators about the things that matter to Australians, subscribe to the Saturday Extra podcast on iTunes , the ABC Radio app or your favourite podcasting app .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:52:28.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
