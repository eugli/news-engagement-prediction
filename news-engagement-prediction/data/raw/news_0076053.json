ROBERT STEVEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nHalf the roof of a rental home in Mangakino has collapsed in the fire. \nTwo people were staying at the house, Northern Fire Communications shift manager Jaron Phillips said about 5.30am. \nThe house was \"completely\" ablaze. \nAt 7.30am Mangakino Fire Chief Craig Snowball said fire crews had been unable to search one part of the \"gutted\" home where the roof had collapsed onto the house. ROBERT STEVEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nFirefighters initially thought two people may have been inside the holiday home at the time of the fire. \nA car remained parked in the driveway. \nBut by 8.30am police released a statement saying it was believed no-one was inside at the time of the fire. \nWhen firefighters arrived just after 4.30am Snowball said the 100 square-metre bach was engulfed in flames. ROBERT STEVEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nFire investigators are still trying to find out the cause of the fire. \nTheir first concern was to protect the neighbouring home - a mere two metres from the blazing bach. \n\"The whole house was on fire, it was pretty close. All we were doing was protecting exposures - the shed out the back and the neighbour's house. \n\"There were quite a few people outside when we arrived.\" ROBERT STEVEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nThis house in Rimu St, Mangakino, went up in flames at 4.30am on Monday. \nOnce backup arrived, and there were 16 firefighters on site, they dealt with the fire inside the home. \nThe home was owned by people from outside Mangakino, Snowball said, but it had been rented out for the week. \nHe was still trying to find out the whereabouts of the people who rented the bach. \nSnowball said fire crews were waiting on a fire investigator from Tauranga to arrive before they entered the collapsed section.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:10:27.996+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
