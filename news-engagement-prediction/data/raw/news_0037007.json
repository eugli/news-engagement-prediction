Article continues below \nHaving seen him torment Saint Etienne on Thursday there is no doubt that he can play a big part of United's revival. \nAnd speaking before the game United legend Paul Scholes revealed that he thinks the player should be scoring a lot more than he currently does. Article continues below \nHaving finished last season as the club's top scorer with 17 strikes, he's so far only managed to find the net seven times this time around. \nBut Scholes feels that he should be hitting 25 goals a season on the regular. \n\"We've all seen he's capable of scoring goals, beating players - but we're not seeing it enough,\" said Scholes as per the Daily Mirror . \n\"He's still a young player, we have to remember that. I think when you look at wide players, they're always the most inconsistent on the pitch, anyway. I think that will come with him. \n\"And if that does come and the confidence really comes out of him, I think he's got 25 goals a season in him.\" \nThe 21-year-old was eventually hauled off on 84 minutes for Ashley Young. His performance generally earned him some deserved plaudits, but an errant elbow on an opposition player in the second half saw him lucky to avoid a red card. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
