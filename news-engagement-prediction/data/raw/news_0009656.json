Mike Pence and Democratic vice-presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine at Longwood University in Farmville, Va., Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016. (Photo: Joe Raedle, AP) \nDemocrats suffered a big loss on Nov. 8 when voters helped turn several reliably blue states, including Michigan, red for the first time in decades by giving Republican Donald Trump a slim victory and delivering the presidency to the GOP. \nSo it’s not a surprise that national and state Democrats will gather in Detroit on Saturday to figure out how to make sure that doesn’t happen again. \nThe Democratic National Committee will hold one of its four “Future Forums” at Wayne State University, introducing local Democrats to candidates for leadership in the national party organization and discussing both what went wrong in 2016 and how that can be turned around in time for mid-term elections in 2018. \nRead more: How Clinton lost 'blue wall' states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin \n“I think you’re going to see a lot of agreement on where the party needs to go in terms of getting back to the grassroots and organizing,” said Brandon Dillon, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, who is slated to speak at the forum. “There’s already a broad consensus that we’ve got to get closer to the people on the ground and develop a stronger message.” \nThe forums are coming after Trump won the president’s race in the Electoral College, but lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes. The slim winning margins in the typically blue states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, where Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by a narrow 10,704 margin, were the deciding factors for Trump’s victory. \nMichigan Republicans also maintained their 63-47 seat majority in the Michigan House of Representatives and 9-5 edge in the U.S. House of Representatives. But 2018 represents an opportunity, as the midterm elections will include the statewide offices of Governor, Attorney General and Secretary of State, which will be open because the current occupants -- Republicans Rick Snyder, Bill Schuette and Ruth Johnson, respectively -- can’t run again because of term limits; and the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Sen. Debbie Stabenow and every seat in the state House and Senate will be in play. \nThe Democratic National Committee will hold one of its four “Future Forums” at Wayne State University (Photo: Getty Images) \nAt the forum, activists will hear from the candidates running for the Democratic National Committee chair, including the top two contenders, U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison, a Detroit native who now lives in Minnesota and former Labor Secretary Tom Perez; Sally Boynton Brown, executive director of the Democratic Party of Idaho; Raymond Buckley, chairman of New Hampshire’s Democratic Party; Pete Buttigieg, Mayor of South Bend, Indiana; Television commentator Jehmu Greene of Texas; Jaime Harrison, chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party; Peter Peckarsky, a businessman from Wisconsin; Sam Ronan, an Air Force veteran from Ohio; and Democratic activist Robert Vinson Brannum of Washington D.C. \nIn addition, current DNC chairwoman Donna Brazile, who took over the job when U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced to step down from the DNC after unflattering e-mails were leaked right before the Democratic National Convention in July; Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan and Dillon will be among the speakers at the forum, which begins at 9 a.m. at the Wayne State University’s Community Arts Theater. \nCandidates for the party’s other leadership roles, including vice chairs, secretary treasurer and national finance chair also will speak at the forum. \nThe party’s new leadership will be elected later this month at a DNC meeting in Atlanta, Georgia. Other future forums have been held in Phoenix and Houston, with the last forum to be in Baltimore on Feb. 11. \nStephen Henderson, editorial page editor at the Detroit Free Press, will moderate the panels during the forum. \nContact Kathleen Gray: 313-223-4430, kgray99@freepress.com or on Twitter @michpoligal. 2 CONNECT 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:28:52.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
