They're so nice, you might be tempted to take them home with you. But before you start stuffing your suitcase with goodies, take a minute to learn what's OK and what's off-limits to take home from your hotel room. \nDisappearing Act \nAccording to the housekeeping department at Hilton Kingston , guests often take towels and bathroom toiletries, irons, hairdryers, cable boxes, clock radios, blankets, paintings, ashtrays, TV remote controls, pillows and the Bible. \nAt the Hilton Curacao , guests love the \"Hilton Caribbean Breakfast\" mugs, which disappear daily. They're available in the gift shop, but a few people leave to \"finish their coffee in their room,\" and poof! \nNora Bartlett, housekeeping manager at Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers , says the signature \"S\" crest white pillows and robes often disappear, along with the new coffee makers. \n\nSo what can you take from a hotel room without being considered a bad guest? Basically, you'll want to limit your pillaging to the bathroom. Shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and other bathroom amenities are fair game, since they can't be reused for the next guest. Bathroom slippers are usually complimentary as well, since they can't be used again. Stationary, like logo pens, notepaper, postcards and envelopes, are also left for your use and can be used or packed away for later. Everything else? It should be considered property of the hotel and should be left in the hotel room when you leave.\n\nWhat Happens If You Take It Anyway? \nIf you take something from your hotel room , expect an extra charge on your bill. Robes are such a popular item for guests to take that many hotels now list the charge right on the hanger. \n\"A guest room should feel like a home away from home,\" said Robert Thrailkill, General Manager of the Conrad Miami . \"If the guest enjoys something enough to want to take it home with them, they are welcome to do so, but at a charge. We give guests the option to purchase the items that they are fond of, with everything from the 700 thread count linens and mattresses, to the Conrad Miami signature terrycloth and waffle robes.\" \n\nShop For It Online \nThe best way to take something home with you? Order it online. Hilton has a web site, HiltonToHome , where you can brand-new versions of whatever's in your room, from the soap dish to the Serenity bed. \nIn fact, many hotels have online stores , where you can purchase everything from those 700-thread-count sheets and plush towels, to the lamps, showerheads and even the hotel's bed itself. All brand-new, and you don't have to worry about fitting it in your suitcase.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:15:52.506+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
