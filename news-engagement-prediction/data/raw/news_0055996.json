ANI photo \nABVP and AISA activists from Delhi University clashed on Wednesday, a day after JNU student Umar Khalid’s visit to Ramjas College was blocked by protesting students. According to reports, the ABVP activists were staging a protest in the college on Wednesday as well which led to a clash between them and AISA members. Both ABVP and AISA are student political groups representing opposite ideological stands. \nUmar Khalid and former JNUSU vice president Shehla Rashid were invited to speak at a seminar in Ramjas College on Tuesday but their visit was cancelled after ABVP and DUSU members gathered outside the college gate and shouted slogans against them.
