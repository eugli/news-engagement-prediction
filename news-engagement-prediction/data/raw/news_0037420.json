Malaysian police have made a series of arrests.\n\"I thought she looked very stylish. Iâ€™m also always looking out for newsworthy designs - things that are easily made into memes,\" the designer, who gave his name as Joel and said he lived in the United States, told Reuters in an online message. He declined to give his full name.\nA chief executive of online marketplace Redbubble, where several T-Shirts sporting the LOL (laugh out loud) label are being offered, did not immediately comment. A representative at the company's San Francisco office declined to comment.\nThe designer said sales were slow so far but that he saw the shirt appealing to feminists, internet \"trolls\" and anyone who opposed North Korea and other \"fascist\" regimes.\n(Writing By Peter Henderson; Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin; Editing by Janet Lawrence)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T14:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T13:26:08.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
