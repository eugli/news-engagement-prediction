Close Starc keeps Australia's first innings hopes alive UP NEXT \nRenshaw and Mitchell Starc, who smashed a half-century in 47 balls, helped the tourists bat through the day on a genuine spinners' paradise. \nStarc and Josh Hazlewood's unbeaten final-wicket stand is already worth 51 runs. \nRenshaw retired hurt on 36 because of a stomach bug in Thursday's morning session, but returned to bat after the pre-tea dismissal of Steve Smith. Renshaw was brilliant. Pic: Getty \nThe opener, having never set foot in India before arriving last week, was eventually out edging to Ravichandran Ashwin for 68 after facing 156 deliveries. \nThe 20-year-old's knock was impressive on several fronts - not just because he overcame illness to become the youngest Australian to post a Test half-century in India. \nRenshaw's unfortunate bout of Delhi belly \nAshwin and Ravindra Jadeja, the world's two best Test bowlers according to the ICC's rankings, were turning the ball square on a cracking dust bowl likened to the \"surface of Mars\" by Shane Warne. \nRenshaw's teammates didn't surrender in the sort of woeful fashion that had underlined a nine-Test losing streak in Asia, but equally none of them passed 40 apart from Starc. \nSmith, who won the toss and confirmed Australia had opted against picking a third spinner, survived 95 balls but was needlessly out for 27. \nSmith charged down the wicket and chipped a catch straight to opposing captain Virat Kohli at midwicket, gifting Ashwin the first of his two wickets. \nPeter Handscomb departed the previous over and it would have been a collapse of 3-0 if not for the Decision Review System, which saved Mitch Marsh from a second-ball duck. \nPaceman Umesh Yadav, who didn't bowl until the 28th over, removed David Warner with his second ball and finished as India's leading-wicket taker with four scalps.
