By Sukriti Sharma The Daily Dose FEB 13 2017 \nSukriti Sharma is an eighth-grader at Washington Irving Middle School. She writes regularly for her local community newspapers. \nWhile I was growing up in the Greater Washington, D.C., area, KidsPost used to accompany The Washington Post on Sunday — the day my dad always got the paper. I liked turning the pages, reading essays, poems and pondering sudoku or crossword puzzles, among others. In fact, I still have a page framed on my wall in which the paper wished me a happy 7th birthday, along with my picture and photos of other children who celebrated their birthdays that same week. \nThat helped me develop a deep bond with newspaper-reading culture. Although I love reading news on laptops, desktops, smartphones and gadgets now, I could never grow tired of the feeling of a newspaper between my fingers. How many of our media outlets — excluding Time and The Washington Post , which still provide space for younger readers — in cities and suburbs these days contribute a little space to children’s academic growth? Almost none. And it’s numbing. \nBelieve it or not, newspapers play a paramount role in instilling a reading culture in children. \nBelieve it or not, newspapers play a paramount role in instilling a reading culture in children. If my dad wasn’t a newspaper reader and if he had not bought The Washington Post on a day that KidsPost came as a supplement, I would probably not be arguing so passionately that all newspapers should contribute some space to kids at least once every week, if not in every edition. \nJoining in the conversation became such a part of my life that my dad and I now host a community TV show called American Conversations , which we dedicate to kids’ causes. I understand young people’s stories do not bring in much commercial value for publishers, since they don’t sell well to the people who buy or subscribe to newspapers or media channels. But they should not forget that these newspaper buyers have kids at home who are equally hungry for news of contemporary events and stories. And I am sure that once you start publishing kids’ stuff, there will be different advertisers — those that sell children’s toys or clothes, for example — willing to put their ads in those pages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:37:34.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
