The OPS (Panneerselvam) camp sure of more MLAs revolting. Arun Kumar escaped from the Kovathur resort and will abstain from voting. \nHow close can the trust vote really get? Can Panneerselvam overthrow the government? HT breaks down the numbers : Numbers game Strength of TN assembly: 234 Former CM J Jayalalithaa’s seat is vacant. Opposition DMK chief M Karunanidhi is ailing and won’t be present. Speaker Dhanpal cannot vote unless there’s a tie. So, effective strength of assembly during trust vote: 231 Majority mark: 116 Panneerselvam camp strength: 11 Opposition: 97 Panneerselvam has been buoyed by the opposition DMK grouping – DMK, Congress and Indian Union Muslim League – deciding to vote against the government. \nScenario 1: Palaniswami wins \nPalaniswami holds on to his 123 MLAs and sails past the mark of 116. The total votes against him – 97+11= 108 – won’t be enough to knock his government off. \nScenario 2: Palaniswami loses \nThe chief minister can lose if eight of his MLAs switch sides. Then his strength comes down to 115, one less than the majority. The opposition’s strength becomes -- 97+ 11+ 8 = 116. The governor doesn’t need to vote. \nThe controversy \nSasikala — a long-time confidante of former AIADMK supremo and late chief minister J Jayalalithaa — had been anointed the late leader’s successor by the ruling party and was due to be sworn in last week. \nBut she was pulled into a bruising power struggle by Panneerselvam, who alleged he was forced to resign. Since then, he has been backed by several MPs and MLAs who have switched sides but a majority of the party lawmakers is said to be behind Sasikala, who was sent behind the bars by the Supreme Court in the 21-year-old DA case. \nBefore surrendering in a Bengaluru prison earlier this week, Sasikala appointed Palaniswami the legislature party leader, and the governor later invited him to form the government. Rao had given Palaniswami 15 days to prove his majority but the CM chose to take the floor test immediately – apparently over concerns that the lawmakers confined in the resort for nine days were getting anxious. \nBut now, analysts warn there is a real possibility of Palaniswami losing the vote and going down in history as the CM with the shortest tenure in the state – just three days. \nTit-for-tat sackings \nThe bitterness between the warring AIADMK camps was apparent in a string of tit-for-tat sackings throughout Friday. Panneerselvam loyalist E Madhusudanan expelled Sasikala, her nephews TTV Dinakaran and S Venktatesh and all the ministers of the new government, claiming that their camp was the real AIADMK. \nLate in the evening, the election commission sent a notice to Sasikala on a petition by Panneerselvam’s camp challenging her elevation as interim party chief last month. Panneerselvam also met the assembly speaker P Dhanpal and urged him to conduct a secret ballot that will enable MLAs to vote according to their conscience but was turned down. \nThe Sasikala faction also appointed senior minister KA Sengottiyan as the floor leader for the party. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:02:59.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
