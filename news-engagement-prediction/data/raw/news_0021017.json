(Anthony DelMundo/New York Daily News) The city dispatched 2,300 snowplows and spreaders, with the mayor — who toured Astoria, Long Island City and Jackson Heights in Queens — pleased with the Sanitation Department response.\n“They’re out in full force and doing a good job,” the mayor said. “They’re going at it really hard, really well.”\nDe Blasio rebuffed a question about whether New York was becoming a city of wimps, with the school-closing announcement made early Wednesday and his repeated calls for people to stay home and off the streets.\n“It’s just plain common sense not to go out if you don’t have to, to stay home, to keep your car home,” said de Blasio. “It’s not a moral judgment. It’s not that we’ve changed who we are.”\nTravelers sit stranded at LaGuardia Airport in Queens as the hefty snowfall kept air traffic grounded.

I’ve got to be safe. Driving, too. You can’t go over 20 miles per hour.”\nTechnician Michael Barrett said the roads were unplowed for his ride from Jersey City into Manhattan.\n“I was late to work,” he said. “Coming into the city took me about 35, 40 minutes. I would rather be home right now.”\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:43:22.993+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
