Credit Jeff Pachoud/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images PARIS — A top aide to Marine Le Pen, the French far-right leader and presidential candidate, was placed under investigation on Wednesday after a day of questioning over accusations of the misuse of European Union money to pay parliamentary assistants, a judicial official said. The aide, Catherine Griset, who is Ms. Le Pen’s chief of staff, was taken into custody for questioning along with Ms. Le Pen’s bodyguard, Thierry Légier, who was later released without being placed under investigation, the official said. In reaction to the news, Ms. Le Pen denied any wrongdoing in a case that she said was being used to undermine her campaign. “There is a very big risk of the justice system being manipulated,” Ms. Le Pen said. “I think that today the justice system is not doing its work with a cool head, impartiality and independence. Everything indicates so.” The case has landed her in the spotlight with another leading candidate, François Fillon, who is being investigated over public money he paid to his wife and children as parliamentary assistants. \nAdvertisement Ms. Le Pen said Wednesday that she was convinced that voters would not fall for what her lawyer, Marcel Ceccaldi, said was manipulation intended to destabilize her campaign.
