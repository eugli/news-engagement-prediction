Her apartment is a tiny eight square metres in Tokyo, and narrow enough that she can touch both walls at once. \nEven for Tokyo her apartment is particularly tiny. She chose to live there because of its split levels – there's a loft to separate the sleeping and living areas – its proximity to a train line and its availability on a month-to-month contract, handy when juggling visa time limits. \nIt also has a small balcony, ideal for her plants, and still somehow managed to be bigger than her last place. It costs 69,000 yen – approximately $830 – a month. TOKIDOKI TRAVELLER \nThe entrance to her apartment, with the microwave and toaster oven to the right. \nAnd it does have nearly everything you could ask for – a kitchen (of sorts), a bathroom, a bed and some living space. Admittedly the toaster oven and microwave don't quite fit in the kitchen – they're near the front door on a cabinet, which also stores her dishes and fry pan. \nShe has a table that she uses for a variety of activities – applying her make-up and working on her laptop – and the living area has a small chair and has just – just – enough room to exercise. \nThe toilet in the bathroom is concealed beneath the basin, which needs to be swung out to access it. TOKIDOKI TRAVELLER \nThe toilet is revealed by swinging the basin to the side. \nEmma said that one of the biggest challenges she found was being surrounded by so many things she wants to buy. \n\"You have to be very conscious of what you're purchasing, and have a solid plan for it at home otherwise you will run out of space really fast\", she said. \n\"Minimal is good, as you begin to value every centimetre of space you have.\" TOKIDOKI TRAVELLER \nThe small table, with computer, acts as a multifunctional space. \nIt was also important to get out of the house every day. At the start she found the apartment's size fairly liberating, but \"over time the space feels smaller and smaller\". Ad Feedback \nIn winter it's more difficult to create a sense of space because it's too cold to have the door open, and it can get stuffy inside. \nAnd there's the issue of cooking in a tiny kitchen. With one stovetop element, no oven and no bench space, preparing meals has required some adaptations. She says that she and her friends also \"fantasise\" about baking. TOKIDOKI TRAVELLER \nThe apartment costs her about $830 a month. \n\"If we know someone with an oven they are immediately a close friend,\" she said. \nOn the upside, having guests around isn't completely out of the question. Emma has had visitors during the day, and a friend stay overnight, downstairs on a spare futon that had to be \"folded over her like a burrito\". \nEmma is a freelance English teacher, actor, model and YouTuber with her own channel , and her long-term plan is to stay in Japan while studying Japanese. She is, however, ready to move on from her tiny apartment. \nShe thinks she's learned a lot from living there: \"I don't need many material things to be happy, and that it is possible to avoid clutter.\" And, she adds, from now on she'll value having more space. \nBut would apartments of this size work in increasingly dense cities? \n\"I do think they are a great idea, as long as they are well engineered and well lit and ventilated.\" \n\"Unfortunately my building is directly opposite another apartment complex, so I get no direct sunlight.\" \nFelice has made two video tours of her apartment – one when she just moved in , and one several months later with the apartment fully furnished. Both demonstrate the constraints of living in a such a confined space, and how a clever tenant can work around them. - domain.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:45:14.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
