It has meant teachers are only doing what's required of them in their contract, so things like field trips and extra help after school have been stopped.\nThe premier said that he has done \"considerable soul searching\" on the matter. He said he wants to table legislation that will \"bring an end to this dispute as soon as possible.\"\nThe house is scheduled to meet at 8 p.m. Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:46:30.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
