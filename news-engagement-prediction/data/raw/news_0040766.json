The Habs are limited in their choices because there is an unwritten rule that the coach must speak French. \nBut will the team ever branch out and source a coach from the pool of anglophones?  \n\nThe Randy Cunneyworth experiment Randy Cunneyworth, an anglophone from Etobicoke, became the Canadiens' interim head coach in 2011 after the Habs fired Jacques Martin. \nCunneyworth was the first coach in decades who only spoke English. At the time, he said he knew a few words in French, but \"not all the good ones.\" \nJulien may need time to turn Habs around His appointment ignited a firestorm of criticism from Quebec journalists, radio hosts and politicians. Even the provincial culture minister, a Liberal, criticized the move. \nAt the end of that season, he was replaced by Michel Therrien. \nIt certainly wasn't the first Habs-related language flap — beloved captain Saku Koivu was criticized for his lack of French skills. \nHis successor, Brian Gionta, started learning French before Koivu even vacated the position. \nMontreal Canadiens coach Michel Therrien was fired Tuesday afternoon, after eight seasons with the team. (CBC)\nThat kind of language-related furor never happens with the Montreal Alouettes and it wasn't an issue for the Expos either. But the Habs, of course, are more than just a hockey team. \n\"Hiring a coach is a political act for the Montreal Canadiens,\" said Nicolas Moreau, an associate professor of social sciences at the University of Ottawa. \nMoreau, who co-edited a book about the team, says the team is a social institution. \nThey represent the city at a local level, but can even be considered a national team in their representation of the Quebecois and French-Canadian nation. \nMoreau even posited that the team is a symbol of French resistance to English domination. \nHe pointed to the 1955 Richard Riot, when Canadiens fans revolted over the perceived injustice of Habs legend Maurice Richard, a francophone, being suspended from the playoffs by NHL boss Clarence Campbell, an anglophone, as one example of the connection between the team and its fans.\nRemembering the Richard Riot in song When Cunneyworth was hired, Moreau started analyzing the opinions that fans and bloggers came up with. \nHe classified them into two groups: the romantics, who felt the coach must speak French, and the pragmatic fans, who only cared about having the man most qualified for the job. \nHe found that while the romantics were mostly francophones, they weren't exclusively French-speaking, and vice-versa for the pragmatic bunch. \n\nIt helps, of course, that in coaches such as Therrien and Julien, there exists both those criteria — coaches who speak French and have brought their teams to the playoff promised land. \nIs winning the most important thing? Even Habs legend Guy Lafleur is on the record as saying though the coach speaking French is important to some, in the end what everyone wants is a winning team. \nAs far as an anglophone coach in the near future, Moreau wasn't too hopeful. \n\"Maybe if the coach is Canadian. Probably not an American, or a [European], but a Canadian. Maybe. If he is very good and he's won, for example, four or five Stanley Cups,\" he said. \nBut Moreau said that coach would probably have to learn French eventually, like Bob Gainey did. \nMontreal is a particular market, Moreau pointed out. \nHabs fans are bilingual and so is media covering the team. (Ryan Remiorz/CP)\nDealing with the media is a daily thing, and the majority of the media here is French, as are the majority of the residents. Speaking French is crucial to communicating with a passionate fan base. \nSo the Habs probably won't have an anglophone coach any time soon. But what about in the future? \nMoreau says it's possible. \n\"Sports are political. They reflect society. If there are a lot of debates about identity in society, there will be a lot of debate about identity with the Montreal Canadiens,\" he said. \nIdentity politics are still very much at play in today's Quebec. So the appointment of an English coach may not be a reality for the near future, but it may still prove less impossible than in the past. \nClaude Julien returns to Montreal as Habs dump Michel Therrien", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:47:45.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
