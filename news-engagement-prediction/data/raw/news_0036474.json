(Mark Kodiak Ukena/Lake County News-Sun) Sister Kathleen Long, OP, Director of Fr. Gary Graf Center in Waukegan, talks about the bus of people they sent to Chicago for the Day Without Immigrants protest which closed businesses and schools across the United States including some local establishments, on Thursday, February 16, 2017 in Waukegan. (Mark Kodiak Ukena/Lake County News-Sun) (Mark Kodiak Ukena / Lake County News-Sun) Yadira Sanchez Olson on Thursday, she found it closed with a note on the door explaining that employees were on strike.\nWhile at a conference in Gurnee , someone had recommended that her and her son Benjamin have lunch at the Middle Eastern eatery, where they serve falafels, gyros and shawerma. They were looking forward to eating something unique, she said. \nThe Mundelein woman was unaware that Thursday was a Day Without Immigrants, a campaign that took place locally and across the nation aiming to send a message to President Trump 's harsh stance on immigrants through marches and people opting to be absent from work and school. \nBarker was disappointed she'd have to find some other place to eat, but said she supports the cause. \n\"Well, I guess we're not trying this food today, but this is good,\" Barker said. \"I feel like so many people are feeling powerless and this is a good way to get that power back.\" \nIn Waukegan, many businesses on a short strip of Grand Avenue had their doors closed with signs on windows explaining to patrons that the closure was in support of a demonstration that shows that immigrants contribute to the economy. \n\"The idea is to show the president that it would be better if we worked together toward a solution to the country's problems; one that benefits everyone,\" said Federico Hernandez. \nHernandez is the owner of Taqueria Guadalajara. On Thursday, while he was still taking food deliveries at his Grand Avenue restaurant in Waukegan, Hernandez said the business was closed in solidarity with an immigrant population looking for a way to show its worth. \n\"I'm losing a day of business, my employees are losing a day of wages and my customers won't get served today, but if we don't unite then this won't work,\" Hernandez said. \nIt's unclear how many in Lake County took part in the Day Without Immigrants campaign Thursday, as no one organization led the action. Instead, the call was spread primarily through social media. \nIn speaking with owners of neighboring businesses, which included a bakery, a grocery store and another restaurant, Hernandez said they all decided two days ago that taking part in the demonstration would benefit customers and employees in the long run. \nInside the large empty restaurant in the dark, Hernandez said he'd probably have a loss of approximately $700. \n\"From the bottom of my heart, I hope this day makes a difference,\" Hernandez said. \nHe also expressed fear that the marches and the closures might have the opposite effect and cause retaliation from bosses who aren't on board with their employees' plight, and don't support what they're hoping to change. \n\"This could backfire and make things even more difficult for them,\" Hernandez said of the people who are scared and don't know what lies ahead with an administration that began deportations and travel bans within weeks of President Trump taking office. \n\"It shouldn't be hard to understand. We seek a life with dignity and a decent paycheck, and we're willing to work hard for it,\" said passerby Ricardo Romero of Waukegan. \n\"There's a pyramid of wealth here in this country and the bottom foundation is immigrant labor,\" Romero said. \"It's absurd and ridiculous to try to make people's lives difficult when it's so much better to help each other out.\" \nAt Waukegan Market, it was business as usual at the grocery store owned by Mohammed Zahra, a Palestinian immigrant whose son, Eyad, said the family doesn't believe that a single day can make a difference and therefore didn't close on Thursday. \nEyad said he does hope racism, which he's seen increase in recent years, lessens and \"people show love for one another.\" \n\"It's wrong to generalize and make claims about all Middle Eastern people being terrorist, and all immigrants being bad,\" Eyad said. \"My dad has helped this community by having this business for 25 years. He's providing a service.\" \nOn Thursday, Connie Musinski, one of the Zahras' regulars, stopped by to purchase some items. Musinski said her father was Polish and her mother was Irish. \n\"Aren't we all immigrants? Don't we all need each other for just about everything?\" Musinski said. \nAt Waukegan School District 60, the student attendance rate was at 76.02 percent Thursday, down from Wednesday's 94.68 percent, district spokesman, Nick Alajakis said. \nAt the Round Lake Area Schools, attendance rates were between 74 and 87 percent, down from Wednesday's attendance rates ranging between 94 and 99 percent, said spokeswoman Heather Bennett. \nYuridia Carbajal, outreach coordinator at the Gary Graf Center in Waukegan, said there were eight schoolchildren on the bus that took a group of about 27 people to a Chicago march at Union Park Thursday related to the demonstration. \nCarbajal said many of the people who traveled to Chicago missed work to go to the march because they wanted lawmakers to see that they're united. \n\"We shouldn't be criminalized because we're immigrants. We're here to do better for ourselves and for the country. Immigrant doesn't mean criminal,\" Carbajal said. \nOther restaurants in Lake County, such as Pizzeria DeVille and Milwalky Taco in Libertyville were also closed in support of Day Without Immigrants. \nYadira Sanchez Olson is a freelance reporter for the News-Sun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:27:01.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
