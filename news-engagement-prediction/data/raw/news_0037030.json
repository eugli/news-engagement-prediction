The company says less than 4% of North Americans cruise each year, and the global cruise industry accounts for just 2% of the world’s hotel rooms.\n“Every market in the world is underpenetrated for cruise,” says Mr. Donald, citing a lack of awareness among potential customers and misconceptions about cruising as reasons why many don’t take to the sea. His company’s 10 brands—which range from the Carnival line, marketed as highly social “fun ships” with thousands of passengers, to the luxury Seabourn brand of smaller vessels where staff nearly equal the number of passengers—carry more than 11.5 million passengers a year, about half the total number of people who cruise.\nMr. Donald spoke with The Wall Street Journal about Carnival’s strategies to raise awareness of cruising and keep customers coming back, including new wearable technology that will let passengers personalize their onboard service, scheduled to debut on Princess Cruises’ Regal Princess in November, followed by other Princess ships in 2018. Edited excerpts of the conversation follow.\nExceeding expectations WSJ: A main challenge of trying to increase demand is making people consider cruises as a vacation option. How is your company addressing that?\nMR. DONALD: The first thing we need to do, and we feel we are doing, is exceeding our current guest expectations, because there’s no more powerful marketing tool than lifelong advocates and word-of-mouth.\nBeyond that, what we’ve done is a plethora of things to just keep cruise out in the public domain in a positive light. There are a lot of myths about cruising that we need to debunk. So we have our own original TV series. The other really powerful tool is travel agents to guide people to cruise. We’ve grown our travel-professional network globally. They really understand cruise, and it’s important to get people on the right cruise experience for them.\nWSJ: Does part of giving people what they want involve new technology you recently announced—the wearable Ocean Medallion?\nMR. DONALD: Right. The Ocean Medallion is a way for us to give a highly personalized travel experience.\nCaption text here WSJ: If I took a cruise, what would this medallion enable me to do?\nMR. DONALD: Everything from easier embarkation to real-time delivery of service. You order a drink, and you can walk out on to a deck and the drink will find you. You order a drink in one bar and you go to another bar, that new bartender recognizes you by name and says “Hey, I see you just ordered a Tom Collins, would you like another?” Someone might walk by and say “Hi, just want to give you a heads-up the yoga class starts in about 10 minutes if you still want to go.” Your medallion is also keyless entry to your room, but if you lose it and someone else picks it up, they can’t get in your room because we have multiple identification techniques.\nOvercoming doubts WSJ: What do you think are the most common misperceptions about cruises?\nMR. DONALD: It’s only for young people who want to get drunk, it’s only for old people who have nothing else to do, long buffet lines, congested, restricted, I’m going to get sick, they’re a petri dish for disease. The reality is the norovirus is a land-based virus. Annually it’s estimated about 6% of the U.S. population gets it. On cruise ships, 0.007% is the last set of numbers I saw. But the perception is it’s a cruise disease, because cruise is the only venue that reports it. We identify it and contain it. Then, there are other people who for some reason thought cruising was going to be too expensive.\nWSJ: How are you overcoming those perceptions?\nMR. DONALD: By leveraging—through social media and other methodologies—exceeding our guest expectations. People whocruise are the most powerful messengers, because they tell their families, their friends, the people they work with: “I went on a cruise, it was the best thing ever.”\nJournal Report Podcast Subscribe to the Journal Report podcast at wsj.com , on iTunes or Google Play Music .\nOcean Medallion this year takes us into all types of venues that normally wouldn’t talk about cruise. Then, these original TV series productions, just by people seeing what a ship looks like and how people are on a ship. There is fine dining—we had chef Thomas Keller, of Per Se and the French Laundry, partner with us to create restaurants and dishes on Seabourn ships. On our Carnival brand’s new Vista ship we have a SkyRide, an IMAX theater. On Cunard you can even take your pets.\nThe power of feedback WSJ: How do you anticipate the desires of increasingly sophisticated customers?\nMR. DONALD: We have real-time feedback all the time, and of course with the technology we’ll introduce we’ll have more. We listen to our guests, and I listen to my employees.\nWSJ: How do you have real-time feedback?\nMR. DONALD: Every venue on the ship, every experience with the cabin steward, the dining folks, entertainment, whatever, guests give live feedback, which we note. Our people are trained to take that. And then we do constant surveying—we try not to intrude on guests, but it’s available for them to give us feedback in a more formal written way—to see willingness to recommend, willingness to repeat, what they liked, didn’t like, surveys on the food. We also do traditional market-segmentation studies outside of the ships, where we talk with people who haven’t cruised to see what are the barriers.\nThat’s how we keep the brands at their core essence but allow them to modify to serve those people as their appetites and preferences change.\nMs. Trottman is a writer in Washington, D.C.
