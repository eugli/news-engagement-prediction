Chemistry may seem complex and intimidating, but once you understand a few basics, you'll be on your way to experimenting and understanding the chemical world. Here are ten important things you need to know about chemistry. Chemistry is the study of matter. American Images Inc/Photodisc/Getty Images 1. Chemistry Is the Study of Matter and Energy \nChemistry, like physics, is a physical science that explores the structure of matter and energy and the way the two interact with each other. The basic building blocks of matter are atoms, which join together to form molecules. Atoms and molecules interact to form new products through chemical reactions . \ncontinue reading below our video 4 Tips for Improving Test Performance Chemistry - Science. Yagi Studio, Getty Images 2. Chemists Use the Scientific Method \nChemists and other scientists ask and answer questions about the world in a very specific way: the scientific method . This system helps scientists design experiments, analyze data, and arrive at objective conclusions. Biochemists study DNA and other biological molecules. Cultura/KaPe Schmidt, Getty Images 3. There Are Many Branches of Chemistry \nThink of chemistry as a tree with many branches. Because the subject is so vast, once you get past an introductory chemistry class, you'll explore different branches of chemistry, each with its own focus. The rainbow of colored fire was made using common household chemicals to color the flames. Anne Helmenstine 4. The Coolest Experiments Are Chemistry Experiments \nIt's hard to disagree with this, because any awesome biology or physics experiment could be expressed as a chemistry experiment ! Atom smashing? Nuclear chemistry. Flesh-eating bacteria? Biochemistry. Many chemists say the lab component of chemistry is what got them interested in science... not just chemistry, but all aspects of science. You can make slime using chemistry. Gary S Chapman, Getty Images 5. Chemistry Is a Hands-On Science \nIf you take a chemistry class , you can expect there to be a lab component to the course. This is because chemistry is as much about chemical reactions and experiments as it is about theories and models. In order to understand how chemists explore the world, you'll need to understand how to take measurements, use glassware, use chemicals safely, and record and analyze experimental data.

Chemistry Takes Place in a Lab... and Outside the Lab \nWhen you picture a chemist, you may envision a person wearing a lab coat and safety goggles , holding a flask of liquid in a laboratory setting. Yes, some chemists work in labs. Others work in the kitchen, in the field, in a plant, or in an office. Photo of Earth from the Galileo spacecraft, Dec. 11, 1990. NASA/JPL 7. Chemistry Is the Study of Everything \nEverything you can touch, taste, or smell is made of matter. You could say matter makes up everything. Alternatively, you could say everything is made of chemicals. Chemists study matter, therefore chemistry is the study of everything, from the smallest particles to the largest structures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:50:29.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
