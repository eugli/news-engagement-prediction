An indulgent high tea will also be available, with sweet treats from far-flung destinations served alongside specially-blended teas and champagne cocktails.

Inside the Reform Club before its transformation into Grand Pacific \nLiving Ventures CEO Jeremy Roberts said: \"We are delighted to bring this beautiful room back to life and echo its glorious past as the home of the historic Manchester Reform Club. \n\"Its heritage as a place to relax, eat and drink and just enjoy some of the pleasures of life simply oozes from the walls and it is our privilege and pleasure to let it continue to be what it was always meant to be.\" Read More Six new Manchester restaurants and bars to try in February \nMeanwhile, bar group The Botanist has also announced the opening date for its 12th branch, which takes over former Wetherspoons pub The Milson Rhodes on Monday April 3. \nThe School Lane site, next to burger bar Solita and bistro Hispi, will serve a range of botanical cocktails and gins, as well as a wide selection of world and local beers, alongside a food menu featuring hanging kebabs, rotisserie meats and deli platters.
