As the annual enrollment season for buying insurance has come to a close, there are very real questions about how this all would play out once the law is changed.\nOur economics correspondent, Paul Solman, went to Kentucky to explore that further. It’s part of his weekly series, Making Sense.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Folks, folks, we want to end Obamacare. We want to go to a plan that is so much better and so much less expensive, right?\n(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)\nPAUL SOLMAN: Throughout the campaign, Donald Trump promised to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: So help me God.\nPAUL SOLMAN: And, sure enough, on Inauguration Day, he signed his first executive order, directing government agencies to begin scaling back the law.\nThat was good news for Trump voter Perry Partin, a security guard from Corbin, Kentucky.\nPERRY PARTIN , Kentucky: It was forced on me, shoved down your throat, whether you wanted it or not.\nBOBBI SMITH , Kentucky: I’m with Perry.\nPAUL SOLMAN: Bobbi Smith, who owns an antiques store, was diagnosed with breast cancer in the fall of 2015, a year in which, having missed the open enrollment deadline, she’d accidentally gone without health insurance. She waited until January to buy coverage on healthcare.gov and get treated.\nBut, says this Trump voter:\nBOBBI SMITH: I think if I were to walk around here with no health insurance, and that’s what I choose to do, then that’s my right.\nPAUL SOLMAN: But you’re thankful you have that insurance?\nBOBBI SMITH: Oh, yes, I am, yes.\nPAUL SOLMAN: So, you’re kind of torn here?\nBOBBI SMITH: That’s right.\nPAUL SOLMAN: Elizabeth Easton has no such conflicts.\nELIZABETH EASTON , Kentucky: I love it. The only thing that Trump would be able to do for me would be universal health care.\nPAUL SOLMAN: Easton didn’t vote for Trump. She didn’t vote at all, she says, because she was high and suicidal, having relapsed into drug abuse following a painful spinal infection. She’s now in recovery, her addiction treatment covered by Medicaid, which was expanded under Obamacare.\nELIZABETH EASTON: I have been a user since I was in high school. And I was able to check into treatment because of it.\nPAUL SOLMAN: And you wouldn’t have been without the Affordable Care Act?\nELIZABETH EASTON: It saved my life. It’s — yes, it’s great.\nPAUL SOLMAN: We came to this corner of Kentucky last week, famous as the birthplace of Colonel Sanders’ Kentucky Fried Chicken, because it’s seen one of the biggest drops in the uninsured rate due to the Affordable Care Act.\nKathy Oller says she herself has signed up thousands, including, on this day, mall jewelry store worker Aaron Lewis.\nAARON LEWIS , Kentucky: To me personally, it was worth the peace of mind to have some sort of safety net. In case something did happen to me or in case some illness or accident happened, I would be a little bit more covered, rather than susceptible to bankruptcy.\nPAUL SOLMAN: But when we visited, with just over a week to go before the deadline for 2017 coverage, the enrollment rush had stalled, in part due to the Trump administration’s cancellation of ads urging people to sign up. But there’s another reason, says Oller.\nKATHY OLLER , Obamacare Enrollment Official: Some people feel that because Trump’s in office, why do we have to have it, because they’re hoping they don’t get fined.\nPAUL SOLMAN: In other words, they’re counting on repeal to kill the mandate, the requirement to buy health insurance, or else pay a penalty to the government.\nANTHONY FLANNERY , Kentucky: We get this letter, you got to get insurance, which instantly infuriated me.\nPAUL SOLMAN: Don’t tread on me.\nANTHONY FLANNERY: Yes.\nPAUL SOLMAN: Health care worker Anthony Flannery refused to buy insurance each of the last two years.\nANTHONY FLANNERY: I was looking at like $280 with a $6,000 deductible that would then pay 60 percent of any medical expenses I may incur. And I was like, no, I’m not doing it. So I will pay the penalty. So, last year come tax time, I owed $652.\nPAUL SOLMAN: For tax year 2016, the fine will be higher. But so what, says Perry Partin?\nPERRY PARTIN: It’s cheaper to pay the fine than it is to pay for the insurance.\nPAUL SOLMAN: So are you going to pay the fine, instead of the insurance?\nPERRY PARTIN: I probably will, you know, because, I mean, my cup’s about run over with insurance.\nPAUL SOLMAN: But can whatever replaces Obamacare accommodate Perry Partin, while also caring for Beth Easton?\nELIZABETH EASTON: This time last year, I was in the hospital, almost died several times.\nPAUL SOLMAN: With her many preexisting conditions?\nROBERT FRANK , Economist, Cornell University: If you don’t have a mandate, you cannot have an insurance system.\nPAUL SOLMAN: To an economist like Bob Frank, cases like Easton’s make the logic behind the mandate crystal clear.\nELIZABETH EASTON: The only way a system of insurance can work is if everybody’s in the pool together, healthy and sick people alike. And if you want healthy people in the pool, you have essentially got to mandate that they be a participant.\nPAUL SOLMAN: It’s simply how insurance works, he says.\nROBERT FRANK: The insurance company needs a large number of people, only a few of whom are going to make claims against it.\nPAUL SOLMAN: But if it were mainly sick people in the pool, the costs per person would skyrocket. Moreover, poorer people, who also tend to have poorer health, need financial help to pay their premiums.\nAARON LEWIS: There’s no way to insure people who have lower income are able to get it without increasing taxes on somebody.\nPAUL SOLMAN: In the case of Obamacare, increasing taxes on top earners, who help subsidize most of the 20-plus million people who gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\nROBERT FRANK: And so there you have the three basic components of the Affordable Care Act, mandates — you have to buy insurance — the guarantee that if you have preexisting conditions, you can’t be denied coverage, and then subsidies if you can’t afford to buy insurance.\nIf you take any one of those away, the whole system collapses.\nPAUL SOLMAN: And if the current system is repealed, but not replaced, at least 18 million people stand to lose their insurance within a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office, which might feel worse than never having had insurance at all.\nKATHY OLLER: I think it’s such a backwards step, because they are now excited because they have the opportunity to sign up for health care. And if they take it away, it’s just going backwards, instead of forward.\nPAUL SOLMAN: Behavioral economists call this loss aversion, illustrated in this YouTube cartoon.\nMAN: It’s more painful to lose something than it’s joyful to gain something.\nPAUL SOLMAN: To most people, it turns out, losing $1,000, say, hurts far more than the pleasure of $1,000 windfall. And Bob Frank applies this attachment to what we have to threats to Obamacare.\nROBERT FRANK: Millions have coverage now for the first time. And if they take people’s coverage away from them with this new repeal measure, you’re going to see a political firestorm unlike anything we have seen in recent history.\nPAUL SOLMAN: It was enough to scare Elizabeth Easton straight.\nELIZABETH EASTON: I had an epiphany, like, the world’s gone completely mad, and I have got to get better. Seriously. I’m not joking. So, thank you, Mr. Trump.\n(LAUGHTER)\nELIZABETH EASTON: You got me sober, so I can try to save health care.\nPAUL SOLMAN: No wonder Republicans are having such a tough time coming up with a replacement plan, and how hard it is for working folks like Anthony Flannery, who finally joined the insurance pool this year.\nANTHONY FLANNERY: If we want to look at this from a standpoint of doing my part to fit into this pool and this social responsibility, I can handle that.\nPAUL SOLMAN: But to Bobbi Smith and Perry Partin, it’s the very principle of a mandate that rankles, no matter the economics.\nHow can there be health insurance if the healthier people don’t participate? Because then it’s just going to be the sicker people who are going to be insured, and then the cost is going to be too high, no?\nBOBBI SMITH: You made a point.\n(LAUGHTER)\nBOBBI SMITH: I didn’t say I necessarily agreed. You made a point I will think about.\nPERRY PARTIN: I would say you’re right. But I’m just like her. If you want insurance, it would be your option.\nPAUL SOLMAN: For the PBS NewsHour, economics correspondent Paul Solman, reporting from Corbin, Kentucky.\n  Making Sen$e  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:11:21.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
