However, proud dad Eamonn couldn’t resist sharing an adorable throw-back picture of his youngest son on Sunday to mark his 15th birthday. The snap shows a fresh faced Ruth and Eamonn cuddled up with Jack, with the trio beaming at the camera. \nTake a look inside Ruth and Eamonn's house \nCaptioning the photo, Eamonn wrote: “No time since he was this size…. Now he’s a Man towering over his Mummy & Daddy. Happy15th Birthday to our Jack”. Fans took to send their well wishes, with one writing: “Happy birthday jack mum n dad still looking good xxx”, while another observed: “Jack is your image @eamonnholmes”. Jack, who has three older siblings from Eamonn’s first marriage, Declan, Rebecca and Niall, clearly shares a close bond with his family and is often spoken about by his proud parents, both on This Morning and Loose Women , where mum, Ruth regularly anchors the popular daytime TV show. \nRuth and Eamonn tied the knot back in 2010 in a HELLO! country wedding in Hampshire after 12 years together. Back in 2009, Ruth described how Eamonn had asked for her hand in marriage completely out of the blue, saying: “It was so unexpected and beautiful”. Recently on This Morning , Ruth revealed how Eamonn has asked her mother’s permission for her hand in marriage as her father Dennis – who sadly died back in 2012 – was battling dementia. \"My father obviously couldn't give him permission so Eamonn asked my mum,\" she told viewers. \"I didn't know this and I thought that was a really lovely thing to do. \" Eamonn remarked, \"And you did cry… And you're going to cry again.\" \nThe comments come as the couple discussed a recent storyline on Emmerdale . Last year, Ruth discussed her father's struggle with the illness, saying: \"I remember my dad struggling - and he was a bright man - but he was suddenly with [money] would have his hand out and would say 'take what you want' because he was looking at blank coins in his head I suppose.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:14:16.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
