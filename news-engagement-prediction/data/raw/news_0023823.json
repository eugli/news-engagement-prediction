The volcanic massive is partly covered by the glacier Mýrdalsjökull which fills a caldera depression and covers the eruptive vents. The eruptions are accompanied by enormous laharic floods which have formed a vast sandur plain. The last eruption in Katla occurred in 1918. The Southern coast was extended by 5 km by the laharic flood deposits. Speaking to Iceland Review , Kristín Jónsdóttir, natural hazard program director at the Icelandic Met Office said: 'It's been a long time since Katla erupted, and this could just as well end with an eruption. It's just impossible to tell right now.' Another concern is melting under the ice cap of Mýrdalsjökull glacier, where Katla sits, which, if it occurred, would cause a glacial outburst flood. Ms Jónsdóttir added, 'This could just as well die down, and nothing would result. We simply can't say at this stage.' Katla has been showing signs of restlessness recently, with tremors in September exceeding the magnitude 3 mark The volcanoes in question are Katla, Hekla, Bárðarbunga and Grímsvötn – three of which have already erupted in the last 20 years Despite the fears of Katla erupting, Ms Jónsdóttir added: 'I think we're all ready for her when she comes. This is well organized.' Hekla Hekla, otherwise known as the 'Gateway to Hell', erupted in 2000, sending a cloud of ash up to six kilometres high Hekla, otherwise known as the 'Gateway to Hell' is located in the southern part of the country and has been quiet for sixteen years. But data collected in June last year revealed it is building up magma, and its internal pressure is currently higher than before its last two previous eruptions. The volcano has erupted approximately once every 10 years, from 1970 to 2000, but has remained dormant ever since. Professor Einarsson told Icelandic news agency Visir, that people should stop visiting the volcano, which is a popular tourist destination, due to an increased risk of eruption. 'Hekla is a dangerous volcano,' said Professor Einarsson. 'We could be looking at a major disaster when the next eruption begins if we are not careful.' Hekla is located in the southern part of the country and has been quiet for sixteen years. But data collected in June last year revealed it is building up magma The 4,892-foot (1,491-metre) mountain last erupted in February 2000. 'Hekla is ready – at any moment,' Professor Einarsson said. 'There are also 20-30 planes full of passengers flying right over the top of Hekla every day,' he warns. Bárðarbunga Bárðarbunga is the most recently-active volcano of the four. In 2014, a record-breaking volcanic eruption spewed lava and ash over Iceland's Highlands for nearly six months, leaving behind the largest caldera formation ever observed. THE RECORD-BREAKING BARDARBUNGA ERUPTION Iceland's Met Office issued a 'red alert' at the end of August 2014 after the Bardarbunga volcano, which lies underneath the Vatnajökull glacier, experienced a 'small' eruption. The aviation threat was reduced months later, though scientists at the time warned there was still gas contamination in the area around the eruption site. The researchers say the subsidence was spurred by the intrusion of underground magma, 12 kilometers below the surface Bardarbunga is a large central volcano lying underneath Iceland's Vatnajokull glacier, in the centre of the country. It contains a 2,296ft-deep (700 metre) caldera, hidden beneath ice, covered in extensive flank fissures, from where the majority eruptions take place. The most recent eruption began in August 2014, and lasted until February 2015. The Veidivötn fissure extends for over 62 miles (100km) to the south west, almost reaching Torfajökull volcano, while the Trollagigar fissure extends 31 (50km) to the north east, towards the Askja volcano. The Bardarbunga eruption was the strongest of its kind in Europe in more than 240 years, and released two cubic kilometres of volcanic material. The volcano has been showing signs of restlessness once again, with several earthquakes measuring magnitude three or over. This suggests that magma could be building up below the surface, which could lead to another eruption soon. Grimsvotn Grimsvotn is very near Bardarbunga, and is likely to be fuelled by the same source of magma. In 2011, Grimsvotn erupted, sending a huge plume of ash into the skies, that led to several flights being grounded. Like its neighbour, Grimsvotn has seen seismic activity steadily rising, which suggests that it could erupt again in the near future. While all four volcanoes are closely monitor by geophysicists, it is very hard to predict which will erupt, exactly when and the extent of the eruption.
