ADVERTISEMENT \nUtto has been operating a drug ring that distributed methamphetamine hydrochloride (shabu) in Maguindanao, the PDEA said. \nRajah Buayan community leaders and tipsters provided the information to PDEA-ARMM, which led to Utto’s arrest. \nUtto is now detained at the PDEA-ARMM detention facility in Cotabato City facing charges for violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act. \nHis arrest was preceded by the fall of Fatima Daud Baliwan, a barangay (village) chair in Kabuntalan, Maguindanao and a former member of the town’s council. \nBaliwan, who has been known as the “Maguindanao drug queen” and who topped the PDEA-ARMM drug watch list, was arrested with her son and two others in Cotabato City. \nSeveral sachets of shabu, firearm, credit cards and a luxury vehicle were seized from her.
