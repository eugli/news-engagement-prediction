Marewad had come down with a high fever and was put on a ventilator after his condition worsened. \nDoctors told Marewad’s family he would not survive if life support was removed because the infection had spread throughout his body. His family chose to take him instead of continuing treatment. \nTwo billion children breathe toxic smog worldwide, says UNICEF \nWhen Marewad showed no body movement at the home, his relatives thought he had died.

The 17-year-old was then rushed back to the hospital. \nDr. Mahesh Neelakhantannavar told the Times of India that the boy is now back on a ventilator. \n“We suspect he suffers from meningoencephalitis, an infection caused due to dog bite,” Neelakhantannavar said. \nMarewad’s incident sounds like it’s something from the Twilight Zone, but he’s still breathing.
