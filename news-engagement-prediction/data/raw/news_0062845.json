Last week, mid-day had reported that Hrithik Roshan's mother, Pinky, made a contribution of R10 lakh for her surgery. \nPinky also visited the 37-year-old along with daughter Sunaina. During the meeting, Eman's sister, Shaimaa, told them that Eman is a fan of Hrithik's and hoped to challenge him for a dance-off once on her feet. \nReacting to her statement, Hrithik says, \"I would love to dance with Eman. In fact, I am eager to meet her.\" Hrithik, who is currently out of the country, added, \"She has the opportunity of inspiring millions of people through her fight against life threatening obesity. Once her treatment is complete, I would accept her dance challenge and happily lose to her. But before that, we all must support her in every way possible.\" Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T15:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:54:21.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
