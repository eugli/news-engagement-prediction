And the vote’s outcome has not prevented some high-profile Remain campaigners from emerging as winners in the consultancy world. Teneo, an advisory firm that has a “Brexit client transition unit,” has taken on Craig Oliver, Mr. Cameron’s former director of communications, as well as William Hague, a former British foreign secretary. Portland Communications, a political consultancy and communications company, recruited Victoria Dean, a former British diplomat with experience in Brussels, to head up its so-called Brexit team; Henry Cook, a former aide to Michael Gove, who was a cabinet minister and Leave campaigner; James Starkie, the network manager of Vote Leave; and Amy Richards, a former press office manager for the Remain camp. Adam Atashzai, a former deputy political director to Mr. Cameron, went to Finsbury, a communications and public affairs firm, while Mats Persson, a former adviser to Mr. Cameron on European issues, is with EY, the professional services firm. David Chaplin, the director of strategic communications for the Remain camp, has joined Hill & Knowlton, a public relations group. Edelman, a communications marketing firm (whose website asks clients, “Are you ready for Brexit?”), hired Lucy Thomas, a former deputy director of the Remain camp, and Will Walden, a former adviser to Boris Johnson , a major figure in the Leave camp who is now the foreign secretary. “It’s no surprise agencies are snapping up people from the Remain and Leave campaigns given the huge complexities of Brexit for businesses,” Ms. Thomas said. “For those of us who worked on the Remain side, it is bittersweet to have to advise on the big challenges ahead now that Brexit is a reality, but it is important that businesses have the best advice and are able to make their case loud and clear.” Generally, those who were employed by government as civil servants cannot lobby the government for two years, though that does not prevent them from giving strategic advice. Though consultants normally charge less than trade lawyers, their fees can still run to several tens of thousands of pounds a month, with a top consultant asking more than $6,000 a day, industry insiders say. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Some doubt that the Brexit bounce will last. Mr. Leaman noted that the health of the sector is related to the strength of the economy, which may suffer after the withdrawal. He also says that there are anecdotal reports that continental European companies are more reluctant to approach British companies for advice. But for now, he says, there is “a lot of activity.” Mr. Stephenson, too, accepts that Brexit work will likely be limited to the next few years, but said he thinks that withdrawal from the European Union will mean more regulation in Britain’s Parliament, an area in which his company specializes. He rejected the idea that he is cashing in on uncertainty that he helped to create, arguing that he originally opposed holding the referendum but, when it was called, had to choose which side to support. Mr. Stephenson still believes that Brexit will be good, not just for his company, but also for Britain. But he conceded that the views of his business partner, Mr. Gill, may be more nuanced. “He vacillates,” he said. “We don’t agree on everything but that’s part of our strength. I think we do give a balanced picture.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:24:43.617+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
