I envy them, their youth, their promise, their drive.\nTheir bookstore.\nRELATED: TRENDING LIFE & STYLE NEWS THIS HOUR\nTheir bookstore on wheels. Turner and Thompson Lain are the founders/co-owners/chief dishwashers for Itinerant Literate, a 135-square-foot store housed in a 1958 Yellowstone trailer purchased for $3,000.\nThis is a tale of love and fate, a mutual love of books and a fateful postgraduate meeting in 2012 at the Denver Publishing Institute, a monthlong crash course on the ins and outs of the publishing industry. It's a tale the pair told me over drinks in a local wine bar.\nThe women call their meeting \"kismet,\" though it would take a couple more years for both of them to wind up in North Charleston and working at a nearby specialty press where they would sketch out their dreams during downtime. Well aware that, in Turner's words, \"Book lovers are not necessarily good business owners,\" over months they planned their fantasy bookstore, which was ultimately scaled down to something possible with the limited available resources.\nThe result was first pop-up stores in the Charleston area in April 2015, followed by a crowdfunding campaign to buy the trailer, which made its debut in April 2016.\nNext time you are inclined to look down your nose at the \"entitled\" millennial generation, maybe recall the story of these two women with full-time jobs and home mortgages who saw a need larger than themselves and put it into glorious action.\nThis is not only a story about a love of books, but a desire to use books to improve the community.\nFor all its sophistication and history, the Charleston area is short of bookstores. You Chicagoans have no idea what this is like. We have a couple of Barnes & Noble stores sprinkled about and an excellent used store downtown, Blue Bicycle, that sponsors the nationally known young adult literary festival YALLFest, but we did not have an independent (nonspecialty) bookstore until Itinerant Literate.\nCommunity is at the core of Itinerant Literate's approach. Partly this is a natural outgrowth of having a store that's capable of being in different places on different days, but it's also an extension of the owners' wish to do more than just sell books.\nThe first Sunday of every month is dedicated to children's \"story time,\" at a local coffeehouse, The Orange Spot. Second Saturdays it's adult time at The Brew Cellar.\nEach month they host a book club with up to 25 participants. In March, Charlie Jane Anders, author of \"All the Birds in the Sky,\" will appear via Skype.\nLess than two years in, the store has proved \"viable,\" but Turner and Thompson Lain are eager to put Itinerate Literate on the road for more days, having left their steady publishing gigs for remote and freelance work that will allow them more time with the store. They hope to do more events, lit crawls, live author visits and any other thing they can think of that brings people together to share their love of books.\nThey still think about that \"fantasy\" store, maybe something like Parnassus Books in Nashville, Tenn., owned by author Ann Patchett, which has a mobile store to go with her generous bricks-and-mortar location.\nPerhaps once Turner and Thompson Lain dreamed of working in the glamorous world of New York publishing, but they said their time in the Charleston area and work with the community has convinced them they're right where they belong.\nBookselling will never be easy, but they appear to be in it for the long haul.\nLiterally.\nJohn Warner is the author of \"Tough Day for the Army.\" Follow him @biblioracle.\nBook recommendations from the Biblioracle\nJohn Warner tells you what to read next based on the last five books you've read.\n1. \"A Woman Looking at Men Looking At Women\" by Siri Hustvedt\n2. \"Walk Through Walls\" by Marina Abramovic\n3. \"War and Turpentine\" by Stefan Hertmans\n4. \"What Belongs to You\" by Garth Greenwell\n5. \"Eileen\" by Ottessa Moshfegh\n— Penelope R., Madison, Wis.\nI'm reaching for a classic of modernism here that is a little strange and requires the reader to embrace its dense, poetic style, but Penelope's list tells me she's a good candidate for \"Nightwood\" by Djuna Barnes.\n1. \"Girl Waits with Gun\" by Amy Stewart\n2. \"Hidden Figures\" by Margot Lee Shetterly\n3. \"Firefly Lane\" by Kristin Hannah\n4. \"We Were Liars\" by E.
