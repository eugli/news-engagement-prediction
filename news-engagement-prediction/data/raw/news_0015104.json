LOUIS â€¢ Hundreds of people massed downtown Saturday in the latest local protest against President Donald Trump's executive order banning people from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. \nThe rally outside the Thomas F. Eagleton U.S. Courthouse began about 1 p.m. and featured various speakers. \nMarchers carried signs with messages such as \"Refuges are welcome here\" and \"Alternative Facts: Denying Refugees Is Un-American\" and \"Trump Poster Boy For What Is Wrong With America.\" Protesters then walked down Market Street to the Gateway Arch where they continued cheering and chanting in support of refugees. \nThe demonstration ended with people kneeling and praying together below the Arch. \nAmong those taking part was Ali Abdul, 63, of St. Louis, an imam at an area mosque. \n\"I believe this is a country of immigrants and that's what's special about this country,\" said Abdul, who came to the U.S. from Libya in 1978. \"I'm sorry to see there are people who hate immigrants.\" \nJan Cerny, 68, of Kirkwood, said she's happy about the ruling Friday by a federal judge in Seattle which is temporarily blocking enforcement of the presidential order. \n\"We can grow St. Louis again,\" Cerny said, referring to immigration's possible role in increasing the metro area's population. \"If we all stand up for what we believe in in our community, then we can make a difference.\" \nTrump has said his order is aimed at keeping terrorists from entering the U.S. and protecting Americans. \nHis order included a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, an indefinite prohibition against admitting Syrian refugees and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program. \nThe White House has said the Justice Department would swiftly appeal the federal judge's ruling. \nLast Sunday about 1,000 people upset with Trump's order demonstrated outside Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. \nThen, on Wednesday, several hundred people did the same outside the Clayton office of Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. Political Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch \nBe informed.
