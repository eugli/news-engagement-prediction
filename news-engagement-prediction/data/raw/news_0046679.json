Family and friends have since worked with Pittsburgh law enforcement to organize search groups and have posted numerous fliers with the hopes of locating Mr. James. \nPost-Gazette news partner KDKA-TV reported Tuesday that crews have focused their search efforts along Neville Island. \nPolice combing through footage from Downtown security videos confirmed that Mr. James was walking through the area at 11:46 the night of Jan. 25, minutes after being seen near the Wood Street T Station. \n“The last time we saw him was on that camera right behind us,” said his father, Jeff James, his voice breaking with emotion. “And it was so like him. We saw him walking along, doing what he always does. Smiling, happy, texting, on his way home.” \nJeff James and his wife, Pam, of Frederick County, Md., have been living in a local hotel since their son disappeared. They have spent the days working with local law enforcement, hanging up fliers with their son’s photograph, and searching. \nMore than 70 people held a candlelight vigil for Mr. James Monday evening in Katz Plaza in the Cultural District. \nAnyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to call the Pittsburgh police Missing Persons Unit at 412-323-7141. A tip line has also been set up at 810-294-4858. Callers should reference Law Enforcement Case #17-17022.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:05:28.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
