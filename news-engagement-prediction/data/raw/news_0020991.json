Attorneys for the state won a temporary pause on Trump’s executive order blocking entry to the U.S. by refugees worldwide and certain immigrants from seven Muslim majority nations.\nDonald Trump is waiting with baited breath as the federal appeals court continues to mull over whether to keep Trump's executive ordered immigration ban that targets Muslim nations from entering or leaving the US. Not only will the results set Trump into a Twitter fury if they demolish the ban but President also has numerous lawsuits stacked on top of the case from people seeking relief for specific immigrants or by those standing up for several.\nMedia: MediaOS Video The appeals court ruling comes after an emergency hearing Tuesday that saw the three-judge panel grilling a Department of Justice attorney over the government’s defense of the order.\nThe decision is the latest action in what was the first suit by a state against Trump over the order. Since the lawsuit’s filing, Washington’s claims have been joined by Minnesota, and Amazon and Expedia have filed declarations in support of Ferguson’s position. A trove of statements to the court were filed as well, all in support of blocking the travel ban.\nJudge Robart ruled in Seattle last Friday to approve a motion seeking the temporary restraining order that halted enforcement of Trump’s travel ban nationwide.\nThat ruling ended a week of confusion and frustration for those trying to get back to the U.S. who had been blocked by the ban. After the order was signed late Jan. 27, protests erupted nationwide as federal employees began turning away nationals traveling from the seven predominantly Muslim nations specified in the order.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/75/61/12311652/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/30/60/42/6490242/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/57/01/06/12325305/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:53:50.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
