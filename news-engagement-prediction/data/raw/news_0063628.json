A post shared by Mark Consuelos (@instasuelos) on Feb 21, 2017 at 4:56pm PST \nWhile Consuelos originally laughed off the remarks, calling them the “most ridiculous thing” he ever heard, he too was shocked when his wife’s words became a trending topic. \n“I fly to Dallas and my phone starts buzzing and people are like, ‘Dude, are you mean to your wife after you know?’ I’m like, ‘What are you talking about?'” Consuelos explained. “I get on set the next day, I’m shooting in Dallas and the trending stories on my news app on my iPhone and it comes up, Mark Consuelos is mean to his wife after … grownup time. And I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, what?'” \nConsuelos confirmed that no one can be “mean” post-intimacy if they’re out cold. \n“I fall asleep afterwards,” Consuelos added. \nRipa then suggested her husband was “disinterested,” not mean. \n“If disinterested means sleeping, how about satisfied and just happy, satisfied,” Consuelos shared. \nRipa also revealed Consuelos has been extra-attentive following the misunderstanding. \n“There’s odd conversations like, ‘Do you want to watch “The Real Housewives”?,’‘What do you want to do?,’‘Would you like pizza?,’‘Can I get you flowers?'” \nThe couple has been married since 1996 and are parents to three children.
