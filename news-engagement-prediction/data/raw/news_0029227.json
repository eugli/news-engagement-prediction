New Telegraph reports that the deceased simply identified as Mrs. Egunjobi , had lived in London for the most part of her life and only came back home recently and had been managing the shop opened for her by her children. ALSO READ : \"Blood On Their Hands: Pregnant housewife raped to death in Kano\" It was gathered that Egunjobi had taken some alcoholic drinks at a local joint and became intoxicated. When she started misbehaving, the suspect reportedly offered to lead her home so that she would not be injured, however when he got to her shop, he took advantage of her and raped her to death at about 11 pm on Sunday, February 12, 2017. The Coordinator of Oodua People’s Congress (OPC) in the area, Bamidele Ayeyemi , narrated that he and his group were patrolling the area that night when a man who went to defecate in a nearby bush close to the woman’s shop, discovered that her shop was opened and raised an alarm thinking that armed robbers had broken into the shop. “Immediately we heard the man shouting 'thief, thief', some of my boys and I called for reinforcement and went round the market. Unfortunately, when we moved closer to the woman’s shop, the suspect opened the door and bolted. When the suspect was trying to escape from the scene, one of us was able to identify him as Dare. That was how we started searching for him in the community,” Ayeyemi said. Another resident who identified himself simply as Balogun , said after the remains of the woman had been taken care of, they went to report the incident to the head of the community and policemen at Mowe Division. “What surprised us was that it was the same suspect who promised to take care of the woman so as not to sustain injuries that later took advantage of her. We searched the community for about four hours before we finally apprehended him in the ceiling of an uncompleted building where he was hiding. We then handed him over to the police for appropriate action.” It was learned that Garuba was still making love to the woman without knowing that she had died. The suspect's mother, Jumoke Musa, said that she was fed up with the attitude of her son after doing everything to make him turn out well “I have done everything to prevent him from becoming a hoodlum. I left him with his father’s family after his father’s death because I have remarried and I did not want to endure his way of life. Even while staying with me in my present place, I have bailed him countless times for different offences he has committed in the community.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:07:26.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
