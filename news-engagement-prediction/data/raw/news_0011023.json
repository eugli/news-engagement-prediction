(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez) \nIt took nearly 18 minutes, but we finally got our first score of Super Bowl LI. Falcons running back Devonta Freeman got Atlanta on the board with a 5-yard touchdown run, making the Patriots defense look silly with a great cut to the left side. \nOne Cut. \nHere's another look at it: More from FoxSports — NFL (@NFL) February 6, 2017 \nHis touchdown run capped a five-play, 71-yard drive by the Falcons, which took just 1 minute and 53 seconds. It put the Falcons up 7-0 with just over 12 minutes left in the first half after both teams were held scoreless in the first quarter. \nSome believed Freeman's dive may have warranted a flag, but because he dove before entering the end zone, it was not a penalty. \nNot a foul for going to the ground to celebrate. He went from the field of play into the EZ. Would have been a foul if he scored first. — Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) February 6, 2017 Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:39:46.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
