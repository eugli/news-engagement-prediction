the first team from Hong Kong to play in the AFC Champions League - were humiliated in China as they ended the match having been reduced to nine men. \nHosts Guangzhou, managed by Luiz Felipe Scolari, recorded 38 shots - 18 of which were on target - while their opponents failed to find the target with either of their two attempts. \nEastern got off to a nightmare start when Wong Tsz Ho was sent off in the third minute for hand ball in the penalty area, with Ricardo Goulart scoring the resulting spot-kick. \nIt was already 3-0 by the time Wong Chi-Chung was sent off for a second yellow card in the 34th minute, leaving the history-making Chan with the most difficult of tasks. \nUltimately, winger Liao Lisheng and defender Wang Shangyuan scored doubles, while Paulinho and Alan also got on the scoresheet. \nAlan even had time to miss a penalty, conceded due to another handball that resulted in the first of Wong's two bookings. \nRAMIRES TO THE RESCUE \nJiangsu Suning opened their group-stage campaign with a dramatic 1-0 victory away to Jeju United, courtesy of a last-minute strike from Ramires. \nThe former Chelsea midfielder found the bottom corner after a long free-kick was not dealt with by the home defence. \nJeju were unfortunate to come away from the match with nothing after Lee Chang-min hit the post in the first half and Marcelo Toscano struck the woodwork in the second. \nAWFUL ADELAIDE SEASON GOES ON \nAdelaide United's defence of their A-League title has been terrible – they sit bottom of the table after 20 matches – and their Champions League campaign began on a similarly low note. \nThey were thrashed 3-0 by Gamba Osaka at Hindmarsh Stadium in a repeat of the 2008 final, one which also saw the team from Japan emerge victorious. \nShun Nagasawa's header put Osaka ahead, before Yasuyuki Konno's high finish in first-half stoppage-time served as a hammer blow. \nDylan McGowan's own goal with nine minutes remaining ended the scoring as Adelaide only mustered one shot on target in the match. \nWednesday's other game saw Kawasaki Frontale draw 1-1 at home to two-time winners Suwon Bluewings. \nBoth goals came inside the first 23 minutes, with Shogo Taniguchi's own goal cancelling out captain Yu Kobayashi's early close-range strike.
