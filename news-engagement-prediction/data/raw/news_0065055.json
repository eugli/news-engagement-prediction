The newest Pelican, traded from Sacramento on Sunday in a deal that shocked the NBA, was winsome, charming, encouraged but not quite excitable in his first meeting with the media on Wednesday.\n[ Join a Yahoo Daily Fantasy Basketball contest now | Free NBA Yahoo Cup entry ]\nBecause Cousins is an ex-Sacramento King, however, the former employee of team owner Vivek Ranadive and Kings general manager Vlade Divac couldn’t help but bring up some of the inevitable entanglements that come from freeing oneself from the worst franchise in the NBA.\nIt wasn’t the worst of transgressions, but Cousins did detail the fact that Vlade Divac – who entered Sunday’s All-Star Game reportedly preaching to Boogie’s permanence in Sacramento prior to dealing him before the final oop had been alley’d – was left a tick slow on the phone dial when it came time to relay news of this unexpected move:\nBoogie Cousins at his intro presser in New Orleans. Says Vlade Divac tried to call him after the trade but they didn't speak. \"It's done.\"\n— Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) February 22, 2017\nBoogie asked about the hardest part of the trade: \"The way it was done, the dishonesty that came with it. But I’m okay with it.\"\n— Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) February 22, 2017\nBeyond that, though, it was all good cheer:\nY'all, Anthony Davis TEXTED DeMarcus saying he wants him to come to New Orleans. Then Cousins ran into Demps on the street. MARDI GRAS MAGIC\n— Chris Trew (@christrew) February 22, 2017\nIn moving to the Pelicans, just 2 1/2 games out of the final playoff spot in the West with only 25 to play, Cousins will be allowed to suit up alongside franchise stud and 2017 NBA All-Star Game MVP Anthony Davis, a fellow Kentucky product who missed out on playing next to Cousins as a Wildcat, but one that will share the same uniform as Boogie following four-plus seasons of battling each other in the Western Conference.\n[Follow Ball Don’t Lie on social media: Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr ]\nCousins was asked if the two had extensive experience working against or in concert with each other:\n“We’ve played a lot of pickup ball, played against each other plenty of times, we had our (Team) USA experience, plenty of practices there, so … I can see what [the Pelicans front office] is seeing.”\nWe all can. The placement of DeMarcus Cousins next to Anthony Davis is extraordinary, even removing the borderline astonishing machinations (mostly on Sacramento’s end) that it took to get to this point.\nStill, the question of chemistry, function, role and production with DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis will be better left answered another day, another month, and likely in another season. One that sits years past the one we’re currently in, ages past the last game that Boogie and Davis actually play together – whether that’s in 2018, or 2028.\n\"I think we complement each other perfectly.\" @boogiecousins on playing with @AntDavis23 pic.twitter.com/QZ2rHwqAJB\n— NBA TV (@NBATV) February 22, 2017\n“I think we complement each other perfectly, so I’m excited for the opportunity.”\nNew Orleans general manager Dell Demps refused to characterize the deal, placed not only in a bid to land an All-Star but possibly in a bid to save his career as personnel boss in NOLA, as something that would “define his career,” but all basketball operations chiefs short of Jerry West, Jerry Krause, Pat Riley or Gregg Popovich would be forced into such a declaration. The haul, in Cousins, is that profound.\nEven if the Pelicans had been going great guns since before the deal, which New Orleans (a playoff participant just once in the Davis Era) most certainly was not, this ranks as something for your eventual memoir’s paragraph-long description. Dell Demps done defined himself.\nFor Cousins, the move away from the Kings after a six (and likely seven, prior to the trade)-year professional absence from the postseason couldn’t have come soon enough:\nBoogie on playing with AD: \"It’s crazy, I would go home, just stressed out, pulling my hair out, just praying, praying, send me some help.\"\n— Rachel Nichols (@Rachel__Nichols) February 22, 2017\nAnd the elephant in the room? DeMarcus blew it up:\nDeMarcus Cousins, in response to a question about how competitive he is, says \"about 17 technicals worth\". Room erupts. We love you Boogie pic.twitter.com/tDjjlAkbzL\n— Chris Trew (@christrew) February 22, 2017\nRead More\nPelicans coach Alvin Gentry was quick to remind, laughingly, that New Orleans wanted no part of the mostly-needless tempestuousness that had spurred Cousins on to incur a league-leading 17 technical fouls , pointing out that “we,” on a New Orleans team that features three players with a team-leading TWO technical fouls on the roster, “don’t do that here.”\nCousins didn’t exactly disagree, but he’s still on his “ I gotta be me ”-tip:\n“Being in the position that I’m in right now,” with each pair of technical fouls leading to a game-long suspension for a player working to make the postseason for the first time in his career, “I’m definitely going to have to tone it down a bit. To find that balance, though, I have to remain myself. That’s the way I play, that’s what makes me the player I am.”\nDirectly after adding that, the New Orleans Pelicans handed DeMarcus Cousins his new jersey:\nThe @boogiecousins / @PelicansNBA era begins ???? pic.twitter.com/sZ1v1Egh1M\n— NBA TV (@NBATV) February 22, 2017\nYou can watch the full press conference here:\nFull video of today's #Pelicans press conference: https://t.co/m9RAuRSXqu pic.twitter.com/gK9IUv43tY\n— New Orleans Pelicans (@PelicansNBA) February 22, 2017\nMore on Yahoo Sports:\n• Ex-WNBA star Wiggins claims she was bullied for being straight\n• Lakers president Buss says she waited too long to fire her brother Jim\n• The NBA trade deadline’s most intriguing teams\n• Transgender teen wins wrestling title in controversial fashion\n– – – – – – –\nKelly Dwyer is an editor for Ball Don’t Lie on Yahoo Sports.
