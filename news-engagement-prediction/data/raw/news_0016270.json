(Friend of LeBron), so . . . Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:37 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:37 p.m. ET \nCarmelo Anthony is no better a fit for the Cavaliers than he was when we first heard the Knicks star was being peddled to the Cavs; he's still a ball-stopping isolationist with an aversion to defense. \nHe's still an F.O.L. (Friend of LeBron), though, so we're still getting reports the two might be teaming up. \nThe latest dispatch to that effect came Monday from Knicks beat writer Frank Isola of the New York Daily News. He cited an unnamed \"league source\" saying LeBron is pushing to get 'Melo in exchange for power forward Kevin Love. \nLAWRENCE: Don't expect 'Banana Boat' crew to be drowned by drama \nThat's at least a different wrinkle to this worn-out story. Initial reports said the Knicks approached the Cavs about a trade and the Cavs rightly showed little interest. \nAnd, if the tweets in response to this report are true, then the Cavs are still being sane: UPDATE: A team source told ESPN on Monday night \"there is no substance to any of that\" in regards to the report. â€” NBA on ESPN (@ESPNNBA) February 7, 2017 \nThere are several good reasons why Cleveland should say no to the Knicks: Love is a solid spot-up shooter who needs the ball in his hands a fraction of the amount Anthony does. That's kind of important when a team has James and Kyrie Irving, who love having the rock in their hands and are exceptional with it. \nLove also is the superior rebounder (11.9 per game to Anthony's 6.1), which is significant given the Cavs' overall lack of bulk inside. \nEven Isola wrote Monday that Cleveland \"is in no hurry to part with Love, an All-Star this season who is also younger than Anthony and serves a specific role on the team.\" \nSo the source is either trying to drive a wedge between James and Cavs management (Competing execs? Rival agents?), is trying desperately to keep this scenario alive (Hello, 'Melo? Phil Jackson?), or is just not good at roster construction (looking at you, LeBron). \nDEVENEY: James' latest gamble could set Cavs down dangerous path \nIsola suggested James can \"get the most out of\" Anthony based on how well 'Melo deferred during the 2012 U.S. Olympic team. Put aside that those Games were five years ago and both players' games have evolved/devolved: Can Anthony really change his habits overnight, even with LeBron hounding, er, encouraging him, and still be effective? Seems unlikely. \nJames briefly addressed the earlier rumors last month when he said the team needed to focus on who is currently on the roster and not get caught up in playing \"fantasy basketball.\" \nNow we have one report, already rebutted, suggesting James has put his fantasy GM hat on and begun laying the groundwork for a trade. Seems nuts from this corner. Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:15:51.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
