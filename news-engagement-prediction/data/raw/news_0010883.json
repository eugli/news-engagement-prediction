If a state visit takes place, that is way beyond and above the pay grade of the Speaker.\" \n\"However, as far as this place is concerned, I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.\" \nAs Speaker, Bercow is essentially the chairman of the House of Commons, one of the highest jobs in public life in Britain. He is also one of the 650 MPs elected to parliament. \nNo date has yet been fixed for Trump's state visit. A petition opposed to him meeting Queen Elizabeth II during a state visit has been signed by almost 2 million people. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:15:49.210+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
