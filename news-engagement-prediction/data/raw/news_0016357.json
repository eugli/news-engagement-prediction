This comes after months of inconsistent results and constant roster changes that threatened the stability of the team. \nMushi was originally drafted to lead Fnatic after the European organisation decided to base its Dota 2 team out of Malaysia. The team failed to gain much traction after the initial fanfare, although it did manage an admirable fourth place finish at The International 2016. \nAccording to the announcement by Fnatic, it was Mushi’s decision to relinquish his position. This comes as the team has not managed to find any other solutions to the run of poor results after TI6. \nFor now, the iconic Dota 2 player has said that he has no plans for the future; although we expect other teams to show interest in adding him to their roster. The top teams are currently locked in for the upcoming Dota 2 tournament season, which means that it may be some time before Mushi reappears on the scene.

Khoo “Ohaiyo” Chong Xin is now the senior member of the team, although it is not clear if he will be handed the captaincy. Newcomer Kim “Febby” Yong-min, who joined the team only last month, will retain his position.
