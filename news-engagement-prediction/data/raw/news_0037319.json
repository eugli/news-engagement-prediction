And that time is coming soon: She and Prince William are set to visit the city this March.\nAnd this trip, like all her others, raises the question: What will Kate wear? Here are just a few chic looks we’re hoping she’ll rock during her two-day visit.\n1. A Chanel suit.\nPrincess Kate is no stranger to classic style, and it doesn’t get much more classic than a Chanel suit. Coco Chanel’s namesake brand has been crafting these since the 1920s, and today they’re stitched under the direction of Karl Lagerfeld. A standard black-and-white tweed look, like those below, would be a welcome addition to Kate’s wardrobe — though she can leave the mask in her closet.\nVictor VIRGILE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n2. A Dior dress.\nAnother brand that’s long been synonymous with Paris and French fashion is Christian Dior. Kate, however, has never worn the designer before. She’d be taking a cue from her stepmother-in-law by doing so: In 2013, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, paid a visit to Dior’s atelier while on a visit to Paris. And with a classic Kate-style dress like this blush shift, it’s only a matter of time before the royal mom welcomes Dior into her wardrobe.\nDior\nBuy it! Dior Short Dress, $632; yoox.com\n3. Lots of striped shirts.\nThe French love their striped shirt, and so d oes Kate : She has worn striped tops from Ralph Lauren, J.Crew, and most frequently, Me+Em in the past. But ahead of her trip to Paris, she may want to snag a striped shirt from Saint James, the designer behind the signature French striped shirt, manufactured in Normandy, France.\nGetty\nBuy it!

Le Chameau boots.\nThough wellies (read: knee-high rubber rain boots) may be a classically British look, the pair Kate reaches for most often is actually from a French brand, Le Chameau. She’s worn her Le Chameau boots several times, and with a rugby game on the agenda, there’s a perfect opportunity to break them out for casual occasion on French soil.\nIndigo/Getty Images\nBuy it!

A Longchamp bag.\nSince before her 2011 wedding to Prince William, Kate has been a loyal customer of Longchamp, the luggage brand ubiquitous at airports and many college campuses. There’s practically no doubt that Kate won’t use one of hers to cart her (extensive) clothing choices across the channel. Here, Kate’s stylist, Natasha Archer, carries the royal’s Longchamp after arriving in India last year.\nDominic Lipinski - Pool/Getty Images\nBuy it!

A Hermés Birkin bag.\nKate may love her Longchamps, and there’s no denying they make for an excellent carry-ons, but while in Paris, we’d like to see her rock something that ups the glam factor. Though she typically is strict about her allegiance to itty-bitty handbags (also known as clutches), the world’s longstanding it bag would be the one to sway her to make the leap to something bigger.\nHermes\n7. A Saint Laurent jumpsuit.\nThough she’s always well-dressed, Kate isn’t known for taking risks — but perhaps a new setting will change that. If you’re going to dip your toe into a new sartorial pond, Paris is the perfect place to do it. Like, perhaps, a sequin jumpsuit — seen here in the house’s Fall 2016 ready-to-wear collection? It’s a trendy look, but still relatively modest, which makes it okay for a royal, right?\nMARTIN BUREAU/AFP/Getty Images\nOkay, the chances are slim-to-none. But we can dream, can’t we?\nShow Full Article", "external_links": ["https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-612965816.jpg?w=2840&#038;h=4256", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-520628330.jpg?w=2521&#038;h=3933", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-146491796.jpg?w=719", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gettyimages-185189017.jpg?w=640", "http://amzn.to/2kuDttC", "http://amzn.to/2kHLDzJ", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-514195550.jpg?w=3280", "http://amzn.to/2kHvkTk", "http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=93xLBvPhAeE&subid=0&offerid=439137.1&type=10&tmpid=20705&RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yoox.com%2Fus%2F34657126IM%2Fitem", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/kate-middleton14.jpg?w=1080&#038;h=1440", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-514195550.jpg?w=3280&#038;h=4928", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/kate-middleton14.jpg?w=1080", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/kate-middleton15.jpg?w=1571&#038;h=2000", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/kate-middleton15.jpg?w=1571", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-146491796.jpg?w=719&#038;h=1188", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/gettyimages-185189017.jpg?w=640&#038;h=1136", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-520628330.jpg?w=2521", "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/gettyimages-612965816.jpg?w=2840"], "published": "2017-02-15T19:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:20:13.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
