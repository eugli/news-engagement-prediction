Favorite by PhilHaney on 4 hours ago 1,923 \nNo matter what you think of America’s new Commander in Chief, his personal physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein is a real entertaining character. \nOF COURSE this is Donald Trump’s doctor, we wouldn’t want it any other way. \nLike something out of a whimsical Tim Burton film Bornstein made his appearance on the national stage last year during the presidential campaign when he released a letter stating that Donald Trump is the healthiest human being to ever run for President. \nAt the time the tremendously worded letter raised questions as to if Trump himself had written it. However we later found out that the good doctor had written it hastily while Trump’s limousine waited outside his office to have it hand delivered back to Trump Tower. Email is for losers. \nExecutive order Making Hair Great Again. \nWell now Bornstein is BACK and he has some new information about the health and wellbeing of the most powerful man in the world. According to an interview with the New York Times Dr. Bornstein says The President is taking a small dose of Propecia, a prostate related drug which is used to treat male baldness. However President Trump may want to consult his doctor about these side effects that could hamper his entertainment on any important state trips to Russia . \nPresident Reagan famously kept jars of jellybeans in the Oval Office. Maybe Trump will have a dish filled with little blue “jellybeans\" to help counteract the hair meds? \nAt the age of 70 it is no surprise that Trump would need a little something, something to keep his iconic golden locks bushy and beautiful. He’s just kicking out all of the illegal follicles that refuse to grow. \nDo you think the Propecia pill is working well for Donald Trump? Or should he just stop taking hair growth meds and see what happens? \nFollow Phil Haney on Twitter @PhilHaney More detail »", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:42:28.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
