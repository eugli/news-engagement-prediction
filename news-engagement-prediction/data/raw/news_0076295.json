Britain is a mix of races and people have to understand how much we've taken from the countries these people are fleeing. 'Fortunate' \n\"We have to get a little bit angry about it and do something.\" \nRea said the UK and Ireland were \"very fortunate\", in contrast to a lot of countries in the Middle East and said privilege needed to be shared. \n\"We're privileged, but these people are not privileged and we need to offer them some of the privileges we have,\" he said. \n\"They're not just coming with their hands out, they bring a lot to the country, a lot of talent; new thought; new ways of looking at things and we have to welcome them.\" \nYou can hear more on The Sunday News on BBC Radio Ulster at 13:00 GMT and afterwards on the BBC iPlayer.
