Lmao these refs are too weak man :joy: pic.twitter.com/k075ZpvWuq \nBlackburn lost the match 2-1 as they slipped down to 23rd in the league. Sheffield Wednesday remained in sixth as they battle for the Championship promotion places. \nI can forgive referees for minor mistakes, but Akpan's red card is just plain wrong. Referee was appaling- if you can call him that.
