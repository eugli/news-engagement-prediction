This week, in Quebec City, it was a mosque and six men slaughtered as evening prayers were concluding, many more wounded.\nTwo years ago, it was the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in downtown Charleston, South Carolina, and the slaying during prayer service by a lone shooter of nine congregants, including the pastor.\nIn 2014, a pair of Palestinian men, wielding axes, knives and a gun, attacked worshippers at Jerusalem’s Kehilat Bnei Torah synagogue, killing four and injuring seven. One victim who never awoke from his coma died 11 months later.\nIn 2012, a white supremacist slaughtered half a dozen people at a Wisconsin Sikh temple.\n  Last year, in a suburb of Rouen, France, two self-described devotees of the Islamic State — the terrorist group also known as Daesh or ISIS — slit the throat of an 84-year-old priest during morning mass and took four others hostage.\nIn some Muslim countries, Sunnis attack Shiite mosques and Shiites attack Sunni mosques with numbing regularity.\nJust before this past Christmas, a female suicide bomber detonated a device made from 26 pounds of TNT, killing 25 at the largest Coptic Christian church in Egypt. A year earlier, ISIS released a video that depicted the beheading of 21 Coptic migrant workers as they kneeled on a beach in Tripoli.\nSadly, the list of atrocities is long.\nIn North America, wrathful incidents against faith-based organizations have actually been primarily motivated by greed — robbery of churches, most notably, according to statistics — and domestic violence spillover. We have, fortunately, limited experience of religion-based outrages, though African-American churches in the U.S. have been targeted by white supremacists for decades. Since 9/11, mosques on both sides of the border have also been subjected to waves of vandalism and threats.\nWhether motivated by racism, xenophobia, sectarian animosities soaked in centuries of bloodshed, whether committed operationally, as organized terrorism, whether undertaken by the ubiquitous lone gunman carrying pathological bitterness in his or her heart, the undercurrent is always malice and hatred towards the reviled other .\nWe are all vulnerable, everywhere, to the miscreants and the righteously murderous, the nihilist, the disordered mind who can unleash mass havoc. And everybody should feel the pain, as Canadians mourn the deaths of the victims in Quebec, reassuring Muslims in this country that they are not alone in their grief. There is some comfort in being sad among the many and so thousands attended vigils.\nThe children left fatherless, the widows, the bereft parents, the broader alarmed community — we can only try to bind their wounds by reiterating our collective revulsion for such crimes. Because gestures matter — we have your back.\nIt’s also true that the consolation from political leaders was simultaneously directed at Canada itself — an assertion that this is not us, will never be us, a declaration that is fundamentally unnecessary. We know it to be true. That includes the traumatized worshippers who were present at the Cultural Centre of Quebec’s Grand Mosque on Sunday night and the 6,000 Muslims who reside in Quebec City. There has been no group-blaming, although that might come later, if the tragedy is politicized in a province that steadfastly advocates the primacy of a secular, francophone culture.\nThe assailant can approach in a killer-truck driven into boardwalk strollers or a Christmas market, roll suitcase bombs into an airport, or enter public schools bristling with guns, like some kind of jacked-up guerilla commando nursing toxic grievances. But there’s something mordantly symbolic about striking victims where they pray, when they are communing with their God.\nHow piteously vulnerable and defenseless they are — kneeling or with forehead to ground or singing hallelujahs to a loving All-mighty.\nThe why of such acts in an overwhelmingly peaceful and mutually respectfully society, I think, is an unanswerable question, much as we yearn for explanations, because isolating a reason renders the act almost quantifiable and determinable. It invests a warped kind of legitimacy to the imponderable. Point-blank hatred is the impulse and where the infection took root, how it was inspired, can only ever be related to the individual who acts alone and unilaterally, carving reality out of fantasy. It can rightly be called terrorism, but the malaise of the lone attacker is distinct and should not be conflated with the phenomenon of global terrorism, just as 1.6 billion Muslims shouldn’t be conflated with ISIS and Al Qaeda.\nThe sole suspect in the Quebec savagery — 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonnette, charged Monday with six counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder — is mostly a mystery: university student, chess club geek, former cadet, solitary and “anti-social” according to some neighbours, pleasant as described by a professor.\nMore details about the accused will doubtless emerge. He was never on the radar of intelligence agencies. His ideology, if he has one, hasn’t yet surfaced. While some have depicted him as an online troll, spouting praise for reactionary politicians, much of Bissonnette’s social media footprint — which might shed light on his state of mind — has been deleted. What’s left is mostly banal; views shared by millions upon millions who support hard right wing movements yet would never for a moment contemplate such carnage. There’s got to be something else.\nI don’t know if the accused was an alienated misanthrope. However, lone-wolf as such angry individuals may often be, it is rare that festering malevolence is kept entirely concealed or that a homicidal assault explodes spontaneously. Some acquaintances have told reporters that Bissonnette was known for extremist anti-immigrant views and contempt for feminists.\nThe suspect is accused of using a restricted firearm. Yet, because this is Canada, the attendant debate over guns — always a hand-wringing consequence of mass attacks in the States — has scarcely been raised. It should be.\nThere is a rising tide of divisiveness, xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment that has gripped the U.S., Britain and swaths of Europe. It has not found fertile ground in Canada. We are united in diversity — platitudinous as that sometimes sounds — and stunned on the rare occasions when horror strikes within our domain. Islamic leaders, bearing the burden of their community’s response, have urged calm and stressed inclusiveness.\nThat was the Canada Trudeau promoted over the weekend in his tweaking tweets, clearly aimed at President Donald Trump, though many of us would have preferred a more vigorous condemnation of Trump’s executive order banning Muslim travel into the U.S.\nThat was the Canada which existed before the Quebec City obscenity on Sunday night and that was the Canada so tightly bound together on the sad morning after.\nRosie DiManno usually appears Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:18:19.586+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
