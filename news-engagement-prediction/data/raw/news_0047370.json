I can never transmit to you my feelings about defeats. A player when I managed for the first time at 33 or 34 said that after our first defeat I threw up. Whether you are young or old, every defeat hurts.\n“I am a positive person. I am a fighter. You don’t stay so long in this job otherwise. I’ve always seen the future in a positive way.\n“I do not expect too much from outside, I expect more from me inside. The expectation level gets higher.\nArsene Wenger has come in for a host of stick in the last week (Photo: Stuart MacFarlane / Arsenal FC) Wenger's side were destroyed by Bayern on Wednesday (Photo: Bongarts/Getty) “The fight doesn’t get higher. The fight is always tough. When you hate defeat like I hate defeat, it’s always tough. I’m determined to always fight back.\n“That’s the target in my life. I’m a competitor. I was born like that. When I lose games, of course it’s difficult to take.”\nWenger has won the FA Cup six times during 20 years at Arsenal and they have never lost away from home to lower league opposition.\nThe Frenchman will be determined to maintain that proud record but they will face something very different against Sutton and their 3G artificial pitch.\nBut Wenger revealed that Arsenal have been training indoors at their Hertfordshire HQ on a similar surface to get ready to face Sutton.\nSutton are getting ready for the Gunners arrival (Photo: WENN.com) Arsenal will have to make do with Sutton's artificial surface (Photo: PA) Read More FA Cup quarter-final draw in full with Chelsea set to host Manchester United When asked what the dangers were, Wenger added: “First of all the pitch, secondly their enthusiasm and thirdly that we are not ready for a big fight and subconsciously think that they are a non-league team and it is no matter. That will not happen.\n“Ideally we would like to play on a normal pitch but it has been accepted and the competition is to deal with what you face. We will face an unusual pitch and we will have to deal with it.\n“We will practise inside today because it is an artificial pitch. It is not the same because it is a dry pitch and Sutton I have heard have a wet pitch which they water before the game and is quicker. It is a bit ‘stop’.\n“The weight on the joints is different and you cannot slide to block every time so it makes football a bit different.\n“The ball comes to you suddenly and accelerates and does not slow down like in a normal game, so we have to get used to the different speed.”\npoll loading Will Sutton United beat Arsenal? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Arsenal FC Newsletter Follow @mirrorfootball Subscribe to our Arsenal FC Arsene Wenger Emirates FA Cup Arsenal FC Sutton United FC", "external_links": ["http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1481/4221396001_5326742612001_IVRC1487324692181I-thumb480x360.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=mirrorfootball", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball"], "published": "2017-02-20T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:35:13.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
