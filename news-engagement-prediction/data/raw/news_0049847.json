(ANI) \nTaking a fresh jibe at Congress and once again defending Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s implementation of the demonetisation policy, Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) Member of Parliament (MP) Subramanian Swamy today backed the impacts of the ban on notes. Lauding PM Modi’s crackdown on black money , Swamy stated that while it is easy to criticise the PM over his promises of bringing back black money from foreign countries, there was lack of cooperations from the Bureaucrats. Hitting out at the Congress party, Swamy stated that in 65-70 years of Congress rule, the party had placed so many bureaucrats in the country that chances of cooperation from them had been blocked. \nCiting the need to curb the flow of black money in the country, PM Modi, on November 8, had initiated the demonetisation policy following which there had been a ban on old currency notes of higher denominations. While with the implementation of the anti-graft policy, the BJP government cited crackdown on corruption across the country and the importance of the promotion of cashless transactions, the note ban policy has been facing aggressive protests and uproar from opposition leaders and parties. However, in a strong stand in favour of the newly implemented policy, Narendra Modi-led BJP government remained steady with the decision to target the flow of black money in the country. \nAlso Watch: \nIn the latest jibe against opposition uproar over demonetisation, PM Modi, at an election rally in Orai region of Jalaun in Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, today, hit out at BSP supremo Mayawati. The Prime Minister mocked Mayawati by stating that her party is no longer the Bahujan Samaj Party but ‘Behenji Sampatti Party’. Modi further said that people depositing wealth for themselves can never solve the problems of other people. \nHe also attacked the SP and Congress for criticising the demonestisation decision, saying, “where has Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) reached today…when I announced note ban on November 8 last year, arch-rivals SP and BSP, who never see eye-to-eye, came together…I was amazed when I launched war against corruption and asked for the details of black money. They came together and all including the Congress started speaking the same language.” Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T13:06:44.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
