I took a big bite and waved it in the air towards them, but it was all in good spirit.\" \nHe says that he was just hoping to make the crowd laugh, and insists that none of his family or friends made any money off what is now being dubbed as #PieGate. Great journey well done to all the management players and staff go again Saturday proud to be involved @suttonunited it was a pasty not pie.- Wayne Shaw (@wayneshaw70) 21 February 2017 \nSadly, Shaw didn't even enjoy the pie that much. Explaining, he said: \"It was a meat Cornish pasty - quite nice too. \n\"It was probably a good seven out of ten. It could have done with a bit of chilli sauce on it. \n\"But it gave me terrible bloody indigestion. It was either the onions or the pastry, or maybe I just chomped it too quick. \n\"It didn't cost me anything from the girl at the counter - apart from my job.\" \nYes, sadly he lost his Â£450-a-week job with the non-league club as a result of his cheeky snack. So Wayne Shaw, who slept on a sofa 3 nights a week at Sutton to maintain and run the place loses his job over #piegate . FFS!- Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) 21 February 2017 \nWith great viral fame comes great viral responsibility. \nHe revealed that he'd resigned over Twitter... I'm out of contract now so open to offers. China is on the cards America too but awiting sky sports offer.:grinning: https://t.co/ow7Wfj18Pj - Wayne Shaw (@wayneshaw70) February 17, 2017 \nBefore this, he joked that he would join Arsenal for six Cornish pasties. \nCredit: Good Morning Britain/ITV \nHe became a meme after his team, Sutton United, competed in an FA Cup match against Arsenal. \nAs well as popping to the bar at half-time, he was also snapped tucking into a pie while on the sub's bench. What an absolute fucking bloke. pic.twitter.com/JmxfX0wkS6 - Chris Slegg (@ChrisSlegg) February 20, 2017 \nHowever, the 23-stone goalie is now facing a betting probe from the Gambling Commission, and the FA could follow suit, due to his snack, because a bookie was offering odds of 8-1 that he would be 'caught' eating a pie at some point during the match. Honestly. I feel it should be the law that ALL 2nd choice keepers must eat a pie at some point during the match. #piegate - James Corden (@JKCorden) 21 February 2017 \nShaw admitted after the game : \"A few of the lads said to me earlier on: 'What is going on with the 8-1 about eating a pie? I said: 'I don't know, I've eaten nothing all day, so I might give it a go later on. \n\"...Sun Bets had us at 8-1 to eat a pie. I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let's do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down. Credit: PA \n\"I think there were a few people. Obviously we [Sutton's players] are not allowed to bet. I think a few of the mates and a few of the fans. \n\"It was just a bit of banter for them. It is something to make the occasion as well and you can look back and say it was part of it and we got our ticket money back.\" \nGambling Commission enforcement and intelligence director Richard Watson told the Independent : \"Integrity in sport is not a joke and we have opened an investigation to establish exactly what happened. \n\"As part of that we'll be looking into any irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity.\" When you're hungry, you're hungry #WayneShaw pic.twitter.com/CU560JK4hl - Emma Denley (@emma_denley) February 20, 2017 \nShaw's gaffer, Paul Doswell, was less happy about the situation. He told the Telegraph : \"I think Wayne has become this global superstar on the back of being 23 stone. He's made that a chance to make some more media coverage off the back of it. The reality is I don't know, but it wouldn't surprise me. I don't think it shows us in the best light.\" \nAccording to rules from the FA, players should not \"instruct, permit, cause or enable\" any person to bet the \"result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in, a football match or competition.\" However, as yet the FA has refused to comment on the investigation. \nSutton were beaten 2-0 after Lucas Perez and Theo Walcott both scored, securing Arsenal's place in the quarter-finals, where they will face National League side Lincoln.
