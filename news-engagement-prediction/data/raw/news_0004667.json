A 74-year-old former follower of cult killer Charles Manson is scheduled for another parole hearing Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2017, after California governor blocked previous recommendations that he be released from prison. (Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation via AP, File)\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. — A parole panel on Wednesday recommended the release of a former follower of cult leader Charles Manson after California governors blocked four previous parole recommendations.\nBruce Davis, 74, had his 31st parole hearing at the California Men's Colony at San Luis Obispo as he serves a life sentence for the 1969 slayings of musician Gary Hinman and stuntman Donald \"Shorty\" Shea.\nDavis was not involved in the more notorious killings of actress Sharon Tate and six others by the Manson \"family\" the same year.\nDuring the half-century since the slayings, parole panels have now decided five times that Davis is no longer a public safety risk. Officials cited his age and good behavior behind bars that includes earning a doctoral degree and ministering to other inmates.\nGovernors, however, have the final say on release. Gov. Jerry Brown will have about five months to consider the latest recommendation.\nBrown rejected the previous recommendation last year. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger also concluded that Davis remains too dangerous to be free.\nDavis testified at his 2014 hearing that he attacked Shea with a knife and held a gun on Hinman while Manson cut Hinman's face with a sword.\n\"I wanted to be Charlie's favorite guy,\" he said then.\nAttorney Michael Beckman, who has been fighting for years for the release of Davis, said he is the most rehabilitated prisoner among the 2,000 he is representing in the penal system. \"There's no one even a close second,\" he said.\nLos Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey called the Manson-related slayings \"some of the most horrific crimes in California history.\" She objected to the possible release of Davis.\n\"We believe he continues to exhibit a lack of insight and remorse and remains a public safety risk,\" she said in a statement after the parole decision.\nGary Hinman's cousin, Kay Martley, said Davis' crime was so heinous that he should die in prison.\nHinman was tortured for three days, Martley recounted in remarks prepared for the parole hearing.\n\"This wasn't a crime of passion or impulse; this was slow, calculated and cold-blooded,\" she wrote.\nMartley, who traveled from Hinman's native Colorado to attend the parole hearing, said she was angry about the recommendation.\n\"Just because he's going to be 75, he's considered a low risk even though they said he has a personality disorder that he's going to have to work on — his narcissistic behavior, need for acceptance, his grandiosity.\"\nDavis was convicted with Manson and another follower, Steve Grogan, in the twin slayings. Grogan was paroled in 1985 after he led police to Shea's buried body. Robert Beausoleil, convicted in Hinman's death, remains in prison.\nManson and followers Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles \"Tex\" Watson are imprisoned for the Tate killings. Their co-defendant, Susan Atkins, died of cancer behind bars in 2009.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:58:31.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
