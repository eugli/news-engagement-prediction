Leonard Lance’s town hall meeting Wednesday evening, it almost looked like he had won over a passionate anti-Trump crowd of nearly 1,000. Lance, an eight-year incumbent, answered a question about repeal of the Affordable Care Act by saying he supports \"repairing\" the law and keeping some of its most popular provisions, including protections for pre-existing conditions, banning lifetime caps on coverage and allowing young people to stay on their parents' coverage until age 26. The crowd applauded.\nStory Continued Below\nThen things changed.\nLance said he supported continuing to bar federal funding of abortion. The crowd booed. He said he supported an investigation of Russia’s involvement in the November election, but that he has “full confidence in the intelligence committees” despite the reluctance of some House leaders to investigate former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s contact with Russia. \n“My views are that Russia is not a friend of the United States and that Vladimir Putin has been a bad actor on the world stage, that the incursions into the Ukraine and the Crimea are not to be tolerated, and we should be wary of Vladimir Putin,” Lance said.\n“So do something about it!” an audience member yelled as others jeered. \nThe wave of anger sweeping the country was on full display in New Jersey Wednesday night. Lance is the only New Jersey Republican congressman to hold a town hall since Donald Trump was elected president. Demand for the event was so high — in addition to the 950 people in the auditorium at Raritan Valley Community College, 400 more were in an overflow room and a couple hundred protested outside — that Lance scheduled another meeting in the same place for Saturday morning.\nThere were many boos, catcalls and other interruptions. Every question was critical of Trump. But for all the displeasure from the audience and hundreds of interruptions, the mild-mannered Lance never engaged in any testy exchanges. He went a few minutes over the full 90 minutes budgeted. And by the end of the meeting, the crowd — if not entirely pleased by his answers — gave him a round of applause.\nMost of all, the crowd wanted to see Lance and his fellow Republicans push back against the Trump administration.\nAnnette Cordasco Longo of Bridgewater wanted to know “what you plan to do and how you would mobilize the other Republicans to push back against this man when he makes delusional statements?\"\nLance said he would speak his mind when he disagrees with the president, but it didn’t satisfy the crowd, who launched into a chant of “Push back!” \nLance also angered the crowd when he said he wanted Trump to release his tax returns but thought a bill sponsored by his Democratic New Jersey House colleague, Bill Pascrell, to force Trump or the IRS to turn over his tax returns to the House Ways and Means committee “went too far.” There were loud, extended boos.\nLance did offer some mild criticism of Trump’s policies, saying the estimated $20 billion for a proposed border wall is too high and that he does not support a wall along the entire southern border.\n“I do think that we should beef up security, and that may be a better wall or a better fence in certain locations,” he said. \nLance’s district — the 7th, in Central New Jersey, is solidly Republican. It’s also home to the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, which the president once wanted to make his eternal resting place with a family burial plot. \nBut it’s not a pro-Trump district. \nThe well-heeled, highly educated district went for Hillary Clinton in November by about 13,000 votes, despite going by Mitt Romney in 2012 by a fairly comfortable margin. Lance, meanwhile, managed to win re-election in 2016 by nearly 38,000 votes.\nAs a state senator, Lance developed a reputation as a moderate deal maker who fought with his own party and opposed a disastrous pension plan by a Republican gubernatorial administration. But in Congress, he’s gone more sharply to the right as he’s faced consistent primary challenges from conservatives.\n“Good person. Nice, smart, well-educated, honest,” said Tonnes Stave, 81, who was protesting outside the town hall with his wife, Pat. “But he has been too much of a ‘whatever you say guys, I’ll do it.'” \nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee put Lance on a target list for 2018 late last month, along with nearly every other GOP member of New Jersey’s delegation. \nPeter Jacob, the Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Lance in November, said at the town hall that he’s considering running again.\n“Seeing the energy that is out here, Lance is vulnerable. And without a doubt, he’s scared,” Jacob said.\nBut Lance said he didn’t consider that energy to be anger. He called it “vigor.”\n“I have seen reports of other town hall meetings across the country and they have been vigorous,” he said. “This town hall meeting was vigorous. But I was pleased at the end when people applauded.”\n-- additional reporting by Katie Jennings", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:47:19.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
