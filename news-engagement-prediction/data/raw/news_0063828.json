(AP) \nThe killing of Indian engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla in an apparent hate crime in Kansas City left residents in shock and a majority of people in Olathe saying, “we are not like this” . \nEvents leading up to the incident on Wednesday evening also show that despite rising hate crimes across the country, many had stood up for the two Indians – Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani – when 51-year-old US navy veteran Adam Purinton tossed racial abuses before opening fire. \nHere’s how Kansas residents responded during and after the fatal shooting: \nFriends at the bar \nKuchibhotla and Madasani, both 32, were enjoying an after-work drink in their regular bar when the accused started abusing them using racial slurs. Purinton as soon thrown out after other patrons complained. \nJeremy Luby, 41, a software developer, said he offered to pick up the tab for the two men, who thanked him during a brief conversation about work and cultural differences. “It was wrong what happened to them,” Luby said. “I thought it was a nice gesture to say, ‘I’m sorry someone was being rude to you like that’.” \nAfter the shooting began, another patron, Ian Grillot, 24, said he tried to count the shots while he hid under a table. Thinking the gunman had run out of ammunition, Grillot said, he confronted him, only to be shot in the hand and the chest. \n“People call me a hero…I was just doing what anyone should have done for any other human being,” Grillot said in a video released by the hospital where he received treatment. \nKansas raises funds for victims \nThree GoFundMe sites started for Kuchibhotla and the two injured have raised a total of more than $670,000 so far. \nAs of Friday, the site for Kuchibhotla, whose funeral will be in India, had “$496,196 out of $150 k”. A second combined campaign for Kuchibhotla and Madasani had close to $61,000 and a third site for Grillot was up to more than $200,000. \n“Srini was the kindest person you would meet, full of love, care and compassion for everyone. He never uttered a word of hatred, a simple gossip, or a careless comment. He was brilliant, well mannered and simply an outstanding human being. \n“His wife Sunayana and his family are now faced with incredible grief and a multitude of expenses,” said a tribute on a page created by Kuchibhotla’s friend Kavipriya Muthuramalingam. \nYou can donate here: \n“We’ve set up this fund to help them with the funeral expenses and other ongoing grief/recovery support costs. This includes the very expensive process of carrying his mortal remains back to India, so his parents can say goodbye one last time to their beloved son.” \nAnother page was set up by a man in Shawnee, Kansas, who is not related to either of the victims or their families but was said to be upset about what appeared to be “a vicious hate crime.” \n“Madasani will likely face extensive medical bills and the family of Kuchibhotla will now have to deal with the death of their beloved son, both financially and emotionally,” Brian Eric Ford wrote on the page. \n“Let’s send a message that we will support those who are targeted — and stand against all who wish to spread hate — by raising funds to help the victims of this horrendous act of senseless violence.” \nPrayers for the dead and injured \nResidents of a Kansas City suburb gathered at a church to honour Kuchibhotla. \nAbout 400 people sang, prayed and lit candles on Friday night at the First Baptist Church in Olathe, Kansas and those in attendance described the community as “tight-knit” and one that embraces diversity. \nMayor Michael Copeland encouraged people to come together and said, “One evil act does not divide a united community.” \nThe church offered counseling services and created a “hope banner” to use at a march scheduled for Sunday.
