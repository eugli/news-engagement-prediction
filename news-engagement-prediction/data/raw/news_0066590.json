Others, however, took it one step further. \nJust this week, a source confirmed to E! News that gymnast Simone Biles would be following in her teammate Laurie Hernandez 's footsteps by joining Dancing With the Stars . \nIt's an opportunity Ryan Lochte took full advantage of after his scandal in Rio. And soon after partnering with professional dancer Cheryl Burke , the swimmer was able to show a new side of himself away from the swimming pool. Photos \nStars at 2016 Rio Olympics Michael Loccisano/Getty Images \n\"If I wasn't on this show, I don't know what I would have done,\" he admitted to New York Magazine . \"This has really gotten me out of the dark hole.\" \nWhile he didn't walk away with the mirror ball trophy, he was able to secure new endorsement deals with ROBOCOPP and Pine Bros. Softish Cough Drops. \nAnd as he plans a wedding and the birth of his first child with Kayla Rae Reid , the couple most recently attended 2017 Oscars events including Kari Feinstein's invite-only style lounge.

I really don't have words,\" Aly recently shared with E! News when celebrating the magazine available now. \"This is the most diverse issue they've ever had so to be able to be a part of it is incredible.\" \nPerhaps the closing ceremony at the Olympic games really symbolizes the opening of even more opportunities.
