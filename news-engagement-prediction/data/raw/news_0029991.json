And they die really slow, horrible deaths.\" 'Crude but effective' flaps placed outside burrows Photo: A wombat burrow with a plastic flap outside, containing a medicated solution. (Supplied: ACT Wildlife) \nWombat mange is an Australia-wide problem and treatment programs have been established in a number of areas , including Tasmania, Victoria and even Yass, just across the border from the ACT in NSW. \nThe most common treatment program involves placing plastic flaps, hung from simple wire frames, outside burrows — with a small cup of treatment solution attached. \nThen when the wombat moves through the flap, the solution spills down their backs and helps to kill the mites. \n\"It's really quite crude, but it is so effective,\" Ms Harmer said. \nThe trial in the ACT, based at sites in the Tharwa areas, will canvas about 300 burrows with repeated treatments over the course of four months. \nIt will also investigate the merits of longer-term management of mange, to see if a maintenance program could help stop reinfection. \nMs Harmer said ACT Wildlife fielded a lot of calls from Canberran residents living on the urban fringe around the Murrumbidgee Corridor, who see the animals out grazing — and scratching wildly — during the daylight hours. \n\"The wombats with mange, they end up eating all day long ... to try and get enough energy ... whereas normally they're quite nocturnal,\" she said. \n\"We're getting those calls, seeing the animals suffering ... so we realised it was quite a problem.\" Range of work available for volunteers \nThe problem is so widespread in the ACT, there is almost nowhere in Canberra to reintroduce injured or orphaned animals once they have been treated by volunteers. \n\"If this is successful, we'll be able to treat areas in the ACT to actually eradicate mange, so that we can release orphan joeys that we raise back into the ACT, rather than having to transfer them interstate,\" Ms Harmer said. \nShe said ACT Wildlife were constantly on the lookout for new volunteers, to help with their mange treatment programs. \n\"We've got just under a dozen active volunteers, so we would love some more,\" she said. \nVolunteers can get involved in a numbers of ways — including doing treatment fieldwork, making mange flaps from ACT election corflutes or monitoring cameras. \nAnyone interested in taking part should visit the ACT Wildlife website or call 0432 300 033.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:09:00.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
