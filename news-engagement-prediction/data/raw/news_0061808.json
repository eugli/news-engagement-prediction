And our job everyday is just to execute on that,\" Bannon said. \"And he's maniacally focused on that.\" \nBannon said the mainstream media was dead wrong about the alleged chaos of the Trump campaign and transition. He said they are also dead wrong about what's going on in the White House and how Trump is methodically following through on his promises to the American people. \nBannon added that it's going to be a fight every single day for President Trump, his team and his supporters because the media's attacks will only increase. \n\"They're corporatist, globalist media,\" Bannon said. \"They're adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has.\" \nHe said the media is going to get worse and worse as Trump continues to press his agenda. \n\"If you think they're going to give you your country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:52:05.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
