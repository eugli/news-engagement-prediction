I met people who had kids at home who they made arrangements for. I met people who brought their kids. I met people who quit their jobs. I met people who were commuting like 20 hours in a weekend just to be present,” Bracken said. \nHer work has been featured by a number of news outlets, including Buzzfeed, MacLeans and The Globe and Mail. I'm so incredibly honoured to be a @WorldPressPhoto winner w my #NoDAPL work: the story is ongoing! #StandingRock https://t.co/23Xj98bCNc pic.twitter.com/GC8QIhaqp5 \n— Amber Bracken (@Amber_Bracken) February 13, 2017 \nBracken herself witnessed between 10 and 15 “actions” or demonstrations.
