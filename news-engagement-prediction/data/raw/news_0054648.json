There is contamination in this water and the contamination runs the gamut.” \nLiccardo also said there was not timetable for lifting the evacuation orders. \n“Bluntly, the water is receding, but we are far from out of this,” he said. \nAssistant City Manager Dave Sykes said the flooding from the overflow of the Anderson Reservoir “was a 100-year event.” \n“The situation has now stabilized and we are seeing some improvement, but as the mayor mentioned we are through this,” he said. \nSykes said officials were monitoring conditions, but were surprised when floodwaters overwhelmed the Rock Springs neighborhood. They were aware of flooding at 10 a.m. and had rescue crews on the scene at 10:30 a.m. \n“It’s important to note how swiftly things happened at Rock Springs,” he said. “It reached the banks at a flow level much less than capacity. We were not expecting to have conditions at Rock Springs for many, many hours. We certainly were not expecting Rock Springs to be the first place we had issues. So we have to review that issue.” \nOfficials said at least 14,000 residents had evacuated from their homes to escape the rapidly rising waters on Tuesday and another 30,000 lived in neighborhoods put under a voluntary evacuation order late Tuesday night. \nHighway 101 reopened in both directions Wednesday morning after being closed overnight due to flooding, according to the California Highway Patrol. \nThe highway was closed in both directions between Interstate Highway 880 and the Interstate Highway 280 and Interstate Highway 680 interchange at about 10:45 p.m. Tuesday by flooding from the Coyote Creek. \nNorthbound lanes reopened at about 8:30 a.m. Wednesday, but the southbound lanes remained closed. As of about 10:30 a.m., all lanes had reopened, CHP officials said. \nMeanwhile, breakfast was served to those who were displaced after a relatively sleepless night on cots in James Lick High School’s gym. \nOthers awoke at the home of friends and family members or in local hotels and motels. \nThe plight of the evacuees tugged at the heartstrings of the Bay Area’s largest city. Residents like Shelene Huy-Booker were among those dropping off donations of clothing and toys for the children at the evacuation centers. \n“I spotted this little girl and all I could she had was this Minnie Mouse (doll),” said Huy-Booker, whose voice was filled with emotions. “She was just looking around like she was lost. This is surreal, so I went home and told my daughter – she’s four – I was like: ‘We have to do something.’ We have to get some toys to take to this little girl.” \nEvacuees were also telling stories of their rescues from the waters. Flood victim Juanita Wilson said her belongings started to float around her apartment. \n“That’s like a nightmare, said Wilson. “It’s kind of like something you can’t believe is happening but it is happening.” \nMargaret Cervantes lives on the second story of one of the buildings caught in the flood. She lost her car, but was able to grab some valuables. \n“Just a little bit overwhelmed with everything that’s happened,” said Cervantes. “I was fortunate enough to be able to grab baby books, pictures, clothes, my children, so I feel fortunate.” \nMeanwhile, floodwaters measuring more than four feet deep on some streets had begun to slowly recede. \nAccording to the National Weather Service, the flood waters had receded from a high of 14.4 feet at the height of the surge Tuesday night at Edendale to 11.5 feet by 7 a.m. Wednesday. \nAt Madrone, the creek has receded from 12.6 feet to 9 feet. \nHowever, the Anderson Reservoir, which drains into the Coyote Creek, remained at more than 100 percent capacity and its spillway was still gushing thousands of gallons of water an hour into the creek. \nA flash flood advisory remained in effect at the creek until Saturday. \nThe water spilling in from Coyote Creek was cold and murky. As it filtered through the neighborhoods, it became a noxious stew of sewage, dirty diapers, household chemicals and engine oil. \nAt least 225 residents were taken Tuesday to dry land and rinsed with soap and water to prevent them from being sickened by floodwaters. Health officials urged others to get tetanus shots as an extra safety measure. \nSanta Clara County Supervisor Cindy Chavez sent out helpful tips for the evacuees when they return home. \nWear boots and gloves when working in areas which have been flooded. Be sure the main electrical switch is off before entering a structure. Do not turn it back on until you are certain there has been no damage to wires or appliances connected to the system. Do not use electrical appliances which have been in contact with floodwaters. Look carefully for structural damage which could cause injury, i.e., weakened floors, walls or ceilings which might fall or collapse. Watch for exposed nails and other sharp objects. Check for wild animals, reptiles and snakes which may have taken up residence to escape the floodwaters. Open all windows and doors to allow them to escape, and avoid trapping or cornering them. Snakes can get inside walls. Be cautious when removing drywall. Be especially cautious when approaching sick or injured animals – even household pets. Ensure household pets are properly taken care of during recovery operations by providing clean potable water and food to pets. Do not use food that has come into contact with floodwaters. Dispose of any small dead animals using gloves and a plastic bag. If you smell gas or suspect a gas leak, leave immediately, call 911 and notify the gas company. Warn neighbors of the potential problem. Be sure sewer lines are intact before turning on the water or using the toilet. Wash hands with soap and water that has been disinfected or boiled. Frequent and thorough handwashing is one of the best and easiest precautions. Don’t forget to have children wash, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:28:30.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
