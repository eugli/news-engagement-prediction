Article continues below \nHowever, in an attempt to prove that it is not so hard to miss a conversion, no matter how simple it looks, Russell failed to give his team the extra two points. \nIn fairness to the Glasgow Warriors player, it seemed like that ball was never destined to go between the posts on this occasion. Article continues below \nInitially, the kicking tee was too long to reach him. Conversions must be completed within 90 seconds of a try being scored. \nWhen it eventually reached Russell, you can hear someone urging him to ‘Take it, take it.’ \nUnderstandably, he lost his composure. As the ball was placed unsteadily on its mark, the ball fell over as Russell went to kick it. \nThe ball went directly through the middle but just underneath the posts. \nIf that effort were seen on a football field, it would’ve been described as well taken. \nBefore this, Russell had successfully converted two penalties to bring the Scotland back into the game at half-time. \nLuckily for Russell, those lost two points did not have a major bearing on the final result as the Scots fell 22-16 to France in the Stade de France. \nThe wait for a Scotland victory in Paris goes on, they have not won a game there since 1999. They did go home with the consolation of a losing bonus point, though. \nIn an afternoon which saw four Scottish players forced off injured, the final result can be considered an achievement. \nThe Scotland players can be proud of their display, but you can forgive Russell for fast forwarding past this when he watches back through the highlights. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
