The deal could be finalized Monday night or Tuesday morning. \nJuluke left Louisiana Tech for a position at Texas Tech following the 2015 season. Former Tigers coach Les Miles then hired Juluke as running backs coach after Frank Wilson became the head coach at Texas-San Antonio. \nLast week, LSU coach Ed Orgeron announced that Juluke had been re-assigned to a position in the athletic department and wide receivers coach Dameyune Craig had been fired. Joseph has coached both running backs and wide receivers during his college career. \nCurrent Southern California running backs coach Tommie Robinson is also a major candidate for the other Tigers staff opening. Robinson has experience as a running backs coach in the NFL with the Arizona Cardinals and at Texas. So, Joseph could coach wide receivers if Robinson is hired by Orgeron. \nLike Juluke, Joseph is a native of the New Orleans area. Joseph played his high school football at Marrero Archbishop Shaw. His younger brother Vance was just named the head coach of the Denver Broncos. Mickey’s cousin Terry just became the secondary coach at North Carolina. He had been at Texas A&M. \nMost of Joseph’s college coaching career has been at non-FBS schools. He was the head coach at NAIA member Langston College (Ok.). Joseph had a 13-7 record in two years at Langston. Joseph has been an assistant coach at Alabama State, Nicholls State, Central Oklahoma, Alcorn State and Grambling. \nJoseph, 48, was also the head coach at Desire Street Academy for four seasons. The school relocated to Niceville (Fla.) when Hurricane Katrina hit the New Orleans area in 2005. Desire Street then moved to Baton Rouge. Joseph coached two LSU football signees there – Deangelo Peterson and Lavar Edwards. \nJoseph played his college football at Nebraska where he was the starting quarterback during the 1990 season. The Cornhuskers won their first eight games that year before losing to Colorado. Joseph’s season ended due to a broken leg. He lost the starting job the following year.
