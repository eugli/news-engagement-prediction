Gen. Hal Moore dies; depicted in film 'We Were Soldiers' AP News Share Tweet \nRetired Lt. Gen. Harold G. \"Hal\" Moore, the American hero known for saving most of his men in the first major battle between the U.S. and North Vietnamese armies, has died. \nJoseph Galloway, who with Moore co-authored the book \"We Were Soldiers Once ... and Young,\" confirmed Saturday to The Associated Press that Moore died late Friday in his sleep at his home in Auburn, Alabama. \nGalloway says Moore, his friend of 51 years, died two days shy of his 95th birthday. \nMoore was best known for his actions at the 1965 Battle of Ia Drang, where he was a lieutenant colonel in command of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment. His actions were later reflected in the movie \"We Were Soldiers\" in which actor Mel Gibson portrayed Moore.
