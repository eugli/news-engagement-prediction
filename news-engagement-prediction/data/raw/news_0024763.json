The message was largely unprintable—it contained the words “Goodell,” a word that rhymes with “duck,” and an outline of a male body part. Office workers in the area snapped photos and posted them to social media.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough the Patriots were triumphantly rolling through Boston on Duck Boats, it seems some fans were still bitter about how the team’s championship season began.\nIt was not immediately clear when the message was written, but snow began falling in Boston around 9 a.m. this morning.\nHere’s a link to the message. Warning: Vulgar content, especially if you aren’t a Patriots fan.\nChristina Prignano can be reached at christina.prignano@globe.com .
