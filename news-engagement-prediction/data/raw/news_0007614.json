The Chargers relocated from San Diego to Los Angeles for the 2017 season, creating a void in the city's sporting scene.\nInvestment banking giant Goldman Sachs also withdrew its funding offer on Tuesday, potentially rendering the Raiders vulnerable.\nOakland submitted its bid for relocation to the NFL, and the league's owners are expected to vote in March. Any prospective relocation plan is contingent on the approval of 24 of the NFL's 32 owners.\nAdelson was expected to contribute $650 million, the Raiders and the NFL allocated $500 million, and Nevada Legislature approved $750 million in public funding through a new tax for a prospective venue in Las Vegas. Goldman Sachs' contribution was never disclosed publicly.\nCopyright Â© 2017 Score Media Ventures Inc. All rights reserved.
