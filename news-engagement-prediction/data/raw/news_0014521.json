Especially with the dust conditions that we have onsite today,\" Ron Thomas, president of USW Local 5795, told the CBC.\nSilica dust study welcomed; too late for some Dust study to focus on Lab West mine workers Thomas said of 636 people tested, 515 had no signs of silicosis, 86 people show abnormalities to their lungs and 35 people have suspected cases of silicosis. Some of those cases have already been reported.\n\"If you get a letter that says you should go see your doctor, obviously you should,\" Thomas said.\n\"And if there's signs of silicosis my advice to you is to apply for worker's compensation and if anyone needs any help with that, I got no problem helping out the best I can.\"\nRon Thomas of the USW says workers receiving letters should see a doctor and apply for worker's compensation. (Jacob Barker/CBC)\nThe provincial government says Horizon Occupational Health Solutions, the company contracted to complete the medical x-ray audit, is still finalizing its report, but results have been shared with people who took part.\n\"We look forward to analyzing its findings so that we can enhance awareness and education for workers and medical professionals who assess and treat workers with occupational disease,\" a statement from Service NL read.\nAir quality improvement needed Breathing in silica dust, which is present on the mine site, can lead to silicosis â€” a lung disease which causes scarring on the tissues of the lung. It shows up a number of years after exposure and can increase the risk of other diseases including lung cancer.\n\"I think IOC's got to do more on improving the air quality in around the work site,\" Thomas said.\n\"What we're asking IOC to do now is improve their dust collectors and do some work on the dust collector systems and improve their equipment so that dust levels aren't inside the cab or inside the plants.\"\nThe steelworkers union says IOC has to do more to improve air quality around the site.\nOne bit of good news, Thomas said, is that there are two full time occupational health and safety officers being placed in the area, which is a huge improvement from flying them in every six months.\n\"With two full time people here they should be able to frequent the area quite often and make sure the company is following the proper procedures,\" Thomas said.\n7 years late A study done in 2000 concluded a follow up should be done in 10 years. The union said it's been trying since 2010 to get this one done.\n\"That's frustrating for us too. Every 10 years you're supposed to do it and it took them 15 years to do the first one,\" Thomas said, noting the union had been pushing the PC government to get it done but the study was completed only after the Liberals took power.\n\"Not very often are you going to hear me say something good about the Liberal government but that's one thing that they're doing that's good.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T05:29:37.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
