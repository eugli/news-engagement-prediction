Article continues below \nA few noticeable changes have been made by Conte since the Italian took over in the summer, the biggest being a new formation. \nChelsea played with a 4-2-3-1 system during Mourinho's reign but under Conte, they now deploy an unorthodox - yet effective - 3-5-2 with two wing-backs.

We know exactly what to do on the pitch, where I have to go, differently where they have to go, so we know exactly what to do. \n\"With Mourinho he put the system, but we didn't work lots. We know what to do because we play football, but automatisms were a little different.\" \nWhereas Mourinho used to tell Chelsea's players what to do and leave them to it, Conte runs through each and every tactic to keep the likes of Hazard well drilled. \nMaybe that's why Chelsea are currently top of the Premier League and Mourinho's Manchester United are 14 points behind in sixth. \nCaptain John Terry shares the same opinion as Hazard after telling Steven Gerrard that Conte is a perfectionist when it comes to tactical training. \n\"John Terry said that the difference between Conte and Mourinho is tactics, they work a lot more on tactics in training,\" Gerrard told BT Sport . \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
