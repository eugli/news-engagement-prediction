Speaking while commissioning Indian Coast Guard ship Shaunak at Goa Shipyard Limited , Prabhu said that coastal security was key to India's security and economic prosperity. \n\n\"I believe that in the days to come, based on the way our economy is growing currently, in 10-15 years, India will be the second or third largest economy in the world. Trade has always been an important factor for the economic development and international trade will be equally important,\" Prabhu said while interacting with the media. \n\nMost of India's import and export trade passes through the country's major shipping ports along the country's eastern and western coast. \"If you see, quite a large part of the rail network runs along the coast and in a way, the coast guard helps protect this rail network. Multi-modal transportation is going to be an important thing... Rail infrastructure is susceptible and the Coast Guard helps in its protection,\" Prabhu said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:57:09.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
