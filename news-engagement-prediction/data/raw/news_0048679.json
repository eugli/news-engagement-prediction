Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nTwo friends who filmed trophy videos of themselves beating a young man to death and taunting him - saying: \"Smile for the camera\" - have been jailed for life. \nJoshua Hack and Keith Lowe lured Brendan Mason, 23, to a park before hanging him from a tree and launching the brutal assault. \nHack, 21, and Lowe, 22, took turns hitting Mr Mason over several hours before leaving him for dead naked in a lake at 1.40am on July 5 last year. \nThe killers were later caught on CCTV casually strolling into a McDonald's restaurant after launching their sustained attack in Abbey Park, Leicester. Brendan Mason (Photo: Leicester Mercury) \nA court heard groundsmen found the vulnerable victim, who had learning difficulties, unconscious and bleeding at 7.40am and he was airlifted to hospital. \nMedics discovered he had 99 separate injuries to his head and body, including brain damage, five broken ribs and a collapsed lung, and he died later that day. \nHack, of Beaumont Leys, Leicester admitted murder but Lowe, of Crown Hills, Leicester, originally denied murder and trying to conceal evidence. \nBut when prosecutors played a video of Lowe repeatedly punching and laughing at Mr Mason he changed his plea half way through his trial at Leicester Crown Court. \nThe evil pair were today jailed at the same court for the \"deeply disturbing sustained attack\" which featured the \"most extreme violence\". Hack and Lowe visiting McDonald's after the attack (Photo: Leicester Mercury WS) \nHack was handed a life sentence and must serve a minimum of 20 years and six months. \nLowe was also caged for life and told he must serve at least 21 years behind bars before being considered eligible for parole. \nSentencing, Judge Michael Chambers said: \"Brendan Mason was only 23 with his life before him. \n\"He was sadly a vulnerable young man with learning difficulties. \n\"He was kicked mercilessly while naked. \n\"The video found was a chilling and deeply disturbing recording of Brendan naked, being kicked repeatedly to the head. \n\"He's even told to remove his hands from his face so you can kick him. Brendan on his own, before the assault (Photo: Leicester Mercury WS) \n\"You subjected him to a brutal and sustained attack of extreme violence. \n\"You caused him great pain and humiliation. \n\"This was a planned attack, during which you filmed each other assaulting him and you revelled in what you had done, bragging to others. \n\"You stripped him naked and left him unconscious. He died later that day.\" \nThe judge said Hack had lied in his first interview with the police and even gone with friends to lay flowers at the scene where Mr Mason's body was found. \nHe said Lowe had bleached his bloodstained trousers, washed his hooded top and hidden his blood-spattered shoes in a bid to cover his tracks. \nLowe also refused to tell police how to unlock his phone and tried to text and phone his friend during Hack's police interview to warn him to say nothing.

Hack and Lowe cycling along a canal towpath at the National Space Centre after the assault (Photo: Leicester Mercury WS) \nA second video second video, lasting 53 seconds, showed the \"second wave of the attack\", and was deliberately filmed on the mobile phone for others to see. \nMrs Moore said: \"The audio that goes with it makes that clear.\" \nThe court heard that in the second video, Lowe says: \"Brendan. Look at him. \n\"Told you whatever he'd done to you, I'd do worse to him, told you that. \n\"Move your hand away from your face Move your hand away from your face now.\" \nIn a statement read to the court Mr Mason's uncle, named only as Mr Chambers, said: \"I remember the day Brendan was murdered.

He used to crack jokes and make everyone laugh. \n\"This is something you hear about on TV and never go through.\" \nMichael Auty, defending Hack, said his client had autism and was \"pathetically immature\". \nHe added: \"That he decided to plead guilty took an enormous amount of courage on his part. He functions at an intellect below his chronological age. \n\"When you look at his behaviour a lot of it is utterly puerile.\" \nChristopher Donnellan, representing Lowe, said: \"He accepted there was going to be a confrontation with the deceased but not at the level that it turned into. \n\"He is a young man who has difficulties. \n\"I ask that bearing in mind his current chronological age, any minimum term remains below the years he has lived so that he has a prospect of some hope, one day, he can seek to try and fit in once again.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:36:44.968+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
