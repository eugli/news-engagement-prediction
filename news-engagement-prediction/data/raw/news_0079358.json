You said you personally get along with him. You guys were going at each other for three, four, eight year. It turns out a lot of his people are organizing, do you think he is behind it? \nTrump: No, I think he is behind it. I also think it’s politics. That’s the way it is. \nFox & Friends : Bush wasn’t going after Clinton, Clinton wasn’t going after bush. \nTrump: Well, you never know exactly what’s happening behind the scenes. You’re possibly right but you never know. But I think President Obama’s behind it, because his people are certainly behind it. And some of the leaks possibly come from that group. You know, some of the leaks, which are really very serious leaks, because they’re very bad in terms of national security, but I also understand that’s politics. And in terms of him being behind things, that’s politics, and it will probably continue. Michelle Broder Van Dyke is a reporter and night editor for BuzzFeed News and is based in Hawaii.
