Heat is on for ACT and QLD Photo: This koala was feeling the effects of the Adelaide heatwave. (ABC News: David McMeekin) \nIn the ACT, emergency services issued a total fire ban until Sunday and authorities warned they may also be forced to switch off electricity in parts of Canberra in a bid to avoid any disruptions to supplies. \nAfter facing the hottest maximum temperature (41C) of any capital city on Friday, there will be no respite for Canberra today with the mercury again expected to reach similar heights. The heatwave in your state: Heatwave brings 'off-the-scale' fire danger across NSW \nIf the temperature climbs much beyond 41C, it could be the city's hottest day since 1968, when it reached 42.2C at the airport. \nMany of the territory's reserves and parks will be closed because of the fire danger, including Tidbinbilla nature reserve, Mulligans Flat and the Centenary trail. \nHowever, many popular swimming areas will be open including the Cotter and Uriarra Crossing. \nSouth-east Queenslanders are also in for a steamy weekend, with temperatures rising up to 10C above average across the region and through inland towns. \nBut energy researcher Simon Bartlett said the state's power grid was not under any threat because the high uptake of rooftop solar in the southern part of the state had reduced the overall load on the power network. End is near for Victoria \nNorthern Victoria is bracing for more extreme heat today, with temperatures expected to exceed 40C. \nA south-westerly change has brought cooler weather to the state's far south, but it is yet to take hold in the north. \nThe BOM's Richard Carlyon said Mildura in the north-west had reached 46C for the past two days and, like other districts along the Murray River, was expected to reach more than 40C today. \nHe said the south-westerly change should bring relief overnight. \n\"Just a gradual pushing of this hot air northward across the weekend should end the heatwave by Sunday morning,\" Mr Carylon said. \nHe said although the fire danger was very high in some areas, it was being held back slightly by high humidity. SA residents still reeling from power outages \nIn South Australia, residents in the outback town of Leigh Creek are demanding to know why they were left without phone or internet connection in the middle of this week's heatwave. \nPhones were down for hours on Friday in the Flinders Ranges town and surrounding area, as temperatures soared into the high 40s. \nThe internet was also down, meaning eftpos machines were not working.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:30:16.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
