Share via Twitter Kevin Mazur/WireImage For her Super Bowl LI halftime performance , we expected Lady Gaga to go all out with her beauty look (this is the woman who wore a steak-inspired outfit on the red carpet, after all). But instead, she went with something more subtle—a red lip, bold cat eye, and platinum waves. In a statement provided to SELF, her makeup artist Sarah Tanno explained that the makeup was inspired by \"all of the iconic looks throughout Gaga’s career. I wanted her to be able to look at this 10 years from now and have it feel timeless.” And nothing is more timeless than a crimson pout. To help the lip last, Tanno layered multiple products. First, she moisturized Gaga's lips with a balm (a key first step). Then, she painted on Marc Jacobs Beauty Le Marc Lip Crème Lipstick in Dashing 206 ($30, sephora.com ). Tanno blotted some of the color away with a tissue before adding a second layer. And the final touch was a swipe of the Marc Jacobs Beauty Enamored Hi-shine Gloss Lip Lacquer Lipgloss in Hot Hot Hot 332 ($28, sephora.com ). The candy-apple combination held up through \"God Bless America\" and \"Just Dance\" without smudging. That alone makes this look worthy of applause.
