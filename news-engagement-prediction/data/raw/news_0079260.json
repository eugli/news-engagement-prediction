They even did not bother to talk on providing compensation for extra hours put in by bank staff during the demonetisation period,” All India Bank Employees’ Association (AIBEA) General Secretary C H Venkatachalam told PTI. \nThe UFBU is an umbrella body of 9 unions, but two of Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh affiliates —— the National Organisation of Bank Workers and the National Organisation of Bank Officers —— are not part of the stir. \nUnions are also opposed to the proposed labour reforms of the government and outsourcing of permanent jobs in the banking sector. \nSome of the demands include compensation of employees and officers for extra hours they put in following demonetisation in November and early initiation of next wage revision. \nThey have also demanded adequate recruitment in all cadres, stringent measures to recover bad loans and accountability of top executives. Besides, they have pitched for criminal action against wilful defaulters. \nThe UFBU, which claims membership of nearly 10 lakh across banks, also requested the government for cost reimbursement of demonetisation to banks. \nAs many as 27 public sector banks control 75 per cent of the total business.
