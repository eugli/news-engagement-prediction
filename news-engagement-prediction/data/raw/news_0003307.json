If these rumors are to be believed, users of \"/r/altright\" were posting links to a site called WeSearchr , despite Reddit leadership warning strongly against it. Comment from discussion /r/altright has been banned. Discuss this here! . \nWeSearchr bills itself as \"a marketplace for information,\" where users can contribute money towards \"bounties.\" Right now, for instance, a top WeSearchr campaign has raised a $5,353 bounty for the identity of the person (described on the site as a \"domestic terrorist\") who punched white nationalist Richard Spencer in the face during the protests at President Donald Trump's inauguration . \nReddit's rules strictly prohibit revealing anybody's private personal information, and members of \"/r/altright\" are said to have been warned that even sharing WeSearchr would constitute a violation of those terms. \nThis is just another test of Reddit's struggles to balance safety and free speech, which has been a big issue for the site for some while. \nRichard Spencer, who leads a movement that mixes racism, white nationalism and populism, speaks at the Texas A&M University campus in College Station, Texas AP Photo/David J. Phillip, File \nIn late November , for instance, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman confessed to modifying posts from Donald Trump supporters as a form of revenge for the verbal abuse they were slinging his way. Now, users of the \"/r/The_Donald\" community are afraid that the ban of \"/r/altright\" is a precursor to more \"censorship\" on Reddit and a possible ban for themselves. \nAnd in July 2015, Reddit banned a community dedicated to hating fat people . \n\"There is no single solution to these issues and we are actively engaging with the Reddit community to improve everyone's experience,\" says Reddit in an e-mailed statement. A Reddit spokesperson hadn't yet responded to questions about WeSearchr by the time of publication. \nStill, the mood on Reddit is largely celebratory following the ban:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:07:18.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
