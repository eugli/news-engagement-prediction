Pan’s so-called “Children’s Bill of Rights” is anything but what it’s name implies. When taken to its logical end, it has the power to force all parents in California to vaccinate their children based on the premise that, if they do not, they are somehow depriving their children of their state-ordained rights to medical care. \nThe egregious bill, which Sen. Pan introduced back in December, has all the outward appearances of being a move in the interest of children’s health. It claims to provision that all children will have access to quality healthcare, childcare, and education because of it, at the same time declaring that these benefits are inherent rights that should be afforded to every single child throughout the state. (RELATED: Follow more news about vaccine mandates at Vaccines.news ) \nBut upon closer analysis, the legislation is actually a Trojan Horse bill that deceptively withdraws parental rights from the healthcare equation, allowing the state to decide the healthcare needs of children. If the state should decide, for instance, that vaccines are 100 percent safe and effective, then it suffices that the state could then declare that any child who is unvaccinated is being deprived of his or her rights to healthcare. \n“If a child has a right to basic medical care, this could very well be interpreted to include vaccinations,” warns ANH-USA about Sen. Pan’s legislation. “If the parents of a home-schooled child decide to delay vaccination, or to skip certain shots , the state could argue that the parents are withholding necessary medical treatment and force vaccination on the child.” \nAs to what the state could then do in response to parents who refuse the mandate, ANH-USA adds that such an “offense”could be interpreted by the courts as being “grounds for removing the child from the custody of the parents — and turning him or her over to the state.” Senator Pan is a vaccine tyrant who must be stopped \nThese are frightening prospects, but they represent the mindset of medical tyrants like Sen. Richard Pan, who Natural News earlier exposed as being little more than a Big Phama hack who routinely accepts cash bribes from the vaccine industry. This evil sellout has proven that he will stop at nothing to see all children vaccinated, even against the will of their parents. \nWhile Sen. Pan’s commitment to imposing a vaccine dictatorship has thus far moved forward with few hiccups, this latest stunt could become his undoing. Not only is it a threat to California parents who do not want to vaccinate their children, but it is also a threat to the rest of the country, which often follows in the footsteps of California when it comes to making policy. \n“The zeal of Sen. Pan to impose a vaccine regime on unwilling Californians must be checked,” says ANH-USA, calling on all of its members to take up the fight against vaccine tyranny while we still have the freedom to do so without penalty. \n“It is shameful (and ironic) to use a ‘Children’s Bill of Rights’ as a vehicle to stamp out the last remaining rights of parents to refuse vaccination for their children. What else will the California government determine is best for children, whether parents agree or not? This is an incredibly slippery slope.” \nSources for this article include:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:21:48.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
