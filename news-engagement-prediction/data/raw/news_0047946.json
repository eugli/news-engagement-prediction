He's an ideologue, more on the right, and that's not where you win elections in the longterm in Alberta.\"\nLast-ditch bid to turf Jason Kenney from Alberta PC leadership race fails 'Time is of the essence': Brian Jean calls for merger within six months Ghitter says he's theoretically ripped up his membership card and stopped his donations to the party because he's uncomfortable with Kenney's platform to merge with the Wildrose Party.\nHe doesn't think a united right is a slam dunk to defeat Rachel Notley in \"a modern Alberta.\"\nPCs still have strong brand\n\"[Albertans] voted NDP because the NDP was speaking to them. It wasn't just a negative about the Conservatives,\" he said.\n\"I'm a [Peter] Lougheed conservative. I'm a conservative that believes you're in the middle; you care for all people, you don't go right or left, you deal with the issues that are right for Alberta.\"\nThe PCs still have a strong brand that is on par with the Wildrose Party in terms of popularity, says Ghitter. He says he would like to see the party continue their tradition of strong government.\n\"What you do need is a centrist party, not an ideologue party on the left and what's going on on the right. You need a party that will relate to all Albertans that won't be a social conservative party that wants to get into the bedrooms and all these things of everybody. You don't need that in Alberta.\"\nGhitter admits he may be inclined to vote NDP in the next election if the party moves more to the centre.\nMORE ALBERTA NEWS | Olympic Plaza brick app leads you to your Calgary '88 legacy MORE ALBERTA NEWS | Community, police work together to return stolen WW I medals to family", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T19:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:04:06.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
