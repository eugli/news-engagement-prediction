Email us at \nNorris said the blaze was \"not yet contained, but the crew are quite happy with the resources there\". \nThe fire started just before 6pm and was about 500 metres wide, he said. \nWanaka resident Sarah Veaseyâ€‹ said she had taken her two young children for a swim in the lake when she spotted smoke billowing through the trees. \nShe said a few other families had been swimming nearby and they had all hurried out of the water and called for the fire brigade. \n\"In a few minutes the wind had picked up and the fire had really taken off. There were huge flames and the kids were starting to get quite scared and freak out a bit, so I thought it was best not to stay around and try and help. \n\"A couple of big gusts of wind came through and it got pretty bad really fast. The flames were already 10 to 20m high, so I called [the] fire [service] again and told them they better bring another truck.\" \nVeasey said the blaze started right by the beach near two baches and was moving back quickly towards two houses. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:18:25.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
