Known as \"the Braunschweig terrier,\" the image is believed to date from around 1637; it has been in the museum's collection since 1770. Professor Thomas Doring, the museum's curator of prints and drawings, was first alerted to the error two years ago while cataloging the museum's 10,000 drawings for a digital archive. Da Vinci drawing worth $16M found by retired doctor \"It's been on display for decades under the name of Johann Melchior Roos,\" he told CNN, \"so the idea that this could be a Rembrandt was never considered before.

To find out whether his suspicions were correct, he visited Vienna, Amsterdam and Paris, studying Rembrandt drawings and enlisting the help of other Rembrandt experts. This drawing of a lion (1650-1959), belonging to the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, is one of the few surviving animal studies by Rembrandt van Rijn. He said the response to his painstaking work had been unanimously positive. \"Two of the three leading scholars of Rembrandt's drawings told me they were fully convinced that this is a Rembrandt,\" he said. \"Since then, the third has contacted me to say he also has no doubts.\" \"It's extremely rare for all of the experts in a field to agree on an issue as controversial as this,\" said Doring. Rembrandt included many dogs in his paintings, and practiced by sketching animal studies in chalk. Rembrandt van Rijn's \"The Night Watch\" (1642) from the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. According to a statement released by the museum, \"the Braunschweig terrier\" is very similar to the barking, jumping dog in Rembrandt's 1642 painting \" The Night Watch \", the star attraction at Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum .
