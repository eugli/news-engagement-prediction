The factions vying for the control of the party after JJayalalithaa’s death have set the stage for a political potboiler. \nFollow this space for live updates fromTamil Nadu. \n12:15pm: I am not scared of anyone, I will succeed: AIADMK general secretary Sasikala amid turf war with Panneerselvam.

Almost every day of that week has seen one or more party leader jump ship and support Panneerselvam.

Day before yesterday, the chief secretary and DGP met me and we discussed several issues. Tomorrow, I’m going to the secretariat,” he said. \nBut many say in a state with no elected mayors, village heads and chief minister – and local body polls in limbo. Across the state, city corporations, municipal areas, and panchayats are being administered by special officers because local body elections have not yet been held. \nMunicipal elections were cancelled last October after the poll notification faced several legal challenges.
