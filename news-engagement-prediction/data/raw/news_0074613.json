The city will be seeing sun for most of the day, with a little bit of cloudiness which is a rare sight for winterâ€™s usual grayness. \nOn Friday, temperatures dip down back down to a high of 4C which is still over the average temperatures for February. There will be a 30 percent chance of rain and drizzle. \nSaturday is forecasting for another double-digit day at 12C, but showers and strong winds are expected throughout the day.   \nJust a few days ago, the city broke another temperature record last Saturday when temperatures hovered at 12 C, beating out the 2011 record at 11C. \nTo contrast, the lowest temperature for today was at -19.4C in 1972.
