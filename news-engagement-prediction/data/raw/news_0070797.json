When specifying PC voters, that number hit 61 per cent. \nWatch below: Wildrose Leader Brian Jean joins Global Calgary with details on his plan to try to defeat the Alberta NDP by merging with Alberta’s Progressive Conservatives. \n“Most do not seem to be following the race closely with a majority of Albertans not familiar with Richard Starke (63 per cent) or Byron Nelson (81 per cent),” Maggi said. \nMount Royal University political science professor Duane Bratt suggests “no one knows who Starke or Nielsen are.” \n“This is why they are about to lose, and lose badly, on the first ballot of the PC leadership race,” he said. \nThe poll suggests 54 per cent of Albertans support a merger between the Wildrose and PC parties . Among PC voters specifically, the number increases to 72 per cent. Among Wildrose supporters, the merger would see 65 per cent support. \nREAD MORE: Wildrose’s Brian Jean ‘prepared to step down’ and run for a merged Alberta conservative party \n“Non-conservative Albertans are most opposed to a merger, while conservative Albertans are most in favour of a merger,” Bratt said. “This makes sense: an NDP supporter likes conservative parties so much so that they want two of them. Conservative Albertans are being driven by fears of vote-splitting so they want to ensure that there is one unified conservative party to face the NDP.” \nMainstreet predicted the NDP majority government in the 2015 provincial election , which ended four decades of Tory rule in Alberta. \nMainstreet surveyed a random sample of 2,589 Albertans on Feb. 9-10. Respondents were screened to confirm voting eligibility. Responses were weighed using demographic information to targets based on the 2011 census. \nThe margin of error for survey results is ± 1.93 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. For Edmonton-specific results, the margin of error is ± 3.56 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. For Calgary-specific results, the margin of error is ± 3.28 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
