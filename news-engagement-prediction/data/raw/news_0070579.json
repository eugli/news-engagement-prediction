What Do Birthmarks Mean? \nBirthmarks have quite the reputation, good and bad both. They have been called Angel Kisses and also the Mark of the Devil . Quite the polarity of meaning between these two names bequeathed upon birthmarks don't you think? \nHistory indicates that birthmarks were often regarded with fear and loathing by superstitious, paranoid, and religious fanatics. \nPresent day, many believe birthmarks are indeed lucky omens, and have special meaning just for the individual, such as reincarnation, life purpose , or destiny. Birthmark Meanings Are Speculative at Best \nI recall clipping a piece from a women's magazine. It was probably from Woman's Day or Family Circle. I would often pick up an issue while waiting in the checkout lane at the local grocery market. The clipping was a cute poem that gave superstitious meanings for various locations of moles or birthmarks on the body. I framed it and hung it on my bathroom wall above the toilet bowl as a conversation piece. Unfortunately, I don't remember whatever became of it. \nOne of my birthmarks is actually a piercing. I was born with a natural piercing in my right ear lobe. As a teenager I entertained the idea that this meant that I lived as a gypsy fortune teller in a previous life. My husband has a birthmark shaped like a butterfly marking on the love-handle area on his right side. I ponder if it signifies a rebirth from chrysalis to full flight in this lifetime for him. My oldest son had a cluster of red discolorations on the back of his neck as a newborn. This birthmark or rash, that faded as he grew older, is commonly called stork bites . A Birthmark Could Hint of Possible Cause of Death from Previous Lifetime \nSome people believe that birthmarks are clues to the cause of injury or death from the previous lifetime . In this case the location of a birthmark on the body could indicate a wound. In addition, the shape of the birthmark could be even more telling. For example, a sword or dagger could indicate a stabbing. A flame or torch shape could mean a prior death by fire. A circular marking could indicate a bullet hole. One man was told by a psychic that his birthmark that resembles a hangman gallows meant he had been hung---and in his case, unjustly so! Some people believe that anyone who does not have any birthmarks died of natural causes in their past life. More Past Life Markings \nAside from a sword birthmark possibly being a past life death indicator, a sword could also signal a past life of a being a warrior, or having lived with great strength or bravery. It has been speculated that certain birthmark shapes might indicate a specific trade or ethnic group from a former incarnation. Interesting! Does your birthmark look like a chef's hat or Viking ship? \nPossibly a particular birthmark imprints upon the soul a memory, or a reminder of a lesson learned in a previous incarnation, so as to avoid a similar path or conflict in present day. Animal Spirits as Birthmarks \nAnimal shaped birthmarks can indicate a special connection with the animal kingdom , and specific to the spirit animal teachings . Common animal markings resemble cats, rabbits, birds, a snake, or fish. Or you might have a birthmark that looks like an animal paw, a feather, or wings. Any of these indicates a connection to animals, look to their lessons for insight or enlightenment. Birthmark Omens \nFavorable birthmarks are those that resemble protective symbols such as a rabbit's foot, a four-leaf clover, horseshoe, angel wings, etc. Rather than carrying good luck amulets in your pocket you already have a built in shield. You have been blessed by spirit or the angels. Hearts and Signs for Identification \nBirthmarks have also been thought to be forms of identification, helping twin flames or soul mates to reunite. Heart-shaped birthmarks are especially beloved--a symbol of universal love. Families have sometimes have reported that the same birthmarks show up on their relatives or through the generations. Remember my ear pierce birthmark? My aunt was born with a similar piercing. Astrological Symbols and Connection to the Cosmos \nCrescent moon, shooting stars, and sunbursts are favored birthmarks. Some people with such birthmarks often will feel a strong connection to the cosmos, looking to the skies during introspective periods. Others have reported birthmark shapes that align with their zodiac signs, such as an archer, scorpion, or libra scales. Sacred Geometry \nSacred or spiritual symbols as birthmarks are interesting too, giving pause along with a questioning mind and heart, These shapes include pyramids, diamonds, circles, Star of David, or the rare merkaba. Freckle Clusters \nYou might notice that your freckles tell a story. Freckle clusters create images or resemble maps or regions. They might look like the shape of Florida or the Hawaiian Islands. One woman told me that she has a strand of freckles that resemble the big dipper running from her elbow to her wrist. Also, odd dots that are not the typical freckle can form in clusters. \nThere is really no end to what a person's birthmark looks like. They might look like letters of the alphabet, flowers, a space ship or even a dancing pig! Using Medical Makeup to Camouflage Birthmarks \nBirthmarks are both loved and hated. Some people enjoy the uniqueness that a birthmark awards them, making them feel special. Whereas, others who prefer not to draw attention to themselves feel the birthmark is something they would rather keep hidden. Naturally, if your birthmark is on your bum, then it is easy to conceal. A birthmark on your face or arms is not as easily kept hidden. \nMedical makeup is a type of camouflaging cosmetics originally developed by dermatologists that is intended to treat a variety of skin conditions such as birthmarks, stretch marks, or scarring from surgery or disfiguring injuries. Medical makeup is designed to effectively cover flaws or markings that regular makeup will not cover. \nAvailable products include concealers, foundations, and powders. Medical makeup is thicker in texture and its application lasts longer than regular makeup. Although primarily used on the face and neck, medical makeup can be used to cover the skin anywhere on the body. It can be used to cover age spots on the hands and hide varicose veins on the legs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:07.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
