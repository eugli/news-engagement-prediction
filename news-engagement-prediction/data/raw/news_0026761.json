It’s reasonable to assume that several NBA players would also like to hit Cousins—an elite center, to be sure, but also an occasionally undisciplined hothead with a history of ticking off his teammates, feuding with his coaches, and arguing with referees—square in the nuts, but Hield beat ‘em to the literal punch. (It was just the latest in athlete-on-athlete testicle crimes this season.) \nHield was defending Cousins in the first half of the game when he went in for the kill and flicked Boogie’s junk, just like that. Refs handed Hield a flagrant foul two for the nut shot, which is grounds for an automatic ejection. It wasn’t immediately clear if the hit was intentional or accidental, but Cousins—whose league-leading 17 technical fouls this season give him some experience in this area—demanded the foul and got it.
