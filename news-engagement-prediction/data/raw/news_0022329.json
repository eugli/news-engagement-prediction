Arne Pastoor, Getty Images By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. \nThe normality of a solution is the gram equivalent weight of a solute per liter of solution. A gram equivalent weight or equivalent is a measure of the reactive capacity of a given chemical species (ion, molecule, etc.). Normality is the only concentration unit that is reaction dependent. Here's an example of how to calculate the normality of a solution. Normality Example #1 \n1 M sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) is 2 N for acid-base reactions because each mole of sulfuric acid provides 2 moles of H + ions. \n1 M sulfuric acid is 1 N for sulfate precipitation, since 1 mole of sulfuric acid provides 1 mole of sulfate ions. Normality Example #2 \n36.5 grams of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a 1 N (one normal) solution of HCl. \nA normal is one gram equivalent of a solute per liter of solution. Since hydrochloric acid is a strong acid that dissociates completely in water, a 1 N solution of HCl would also be 1 N for H + or Cl - ions for acid-base reactions .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:49:39.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
