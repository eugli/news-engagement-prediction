'In NSW [officials] think that demand may outstrip supply,' Mr O'Brien said. 'If so, we try to distribute what electricity we can fairly but we will try to protect critical infrastructure. 'Water facilities, hospitals and major transports route - we try to avoid those as best we can.' A massive surge in electricity is expected across the state on Friday afternoon and the government has pleaded for people to turn down their air conditioning to save electricity. Pictured, a woman on Bondi Beach on Thursday Meteorologists said the heatwave is the 'final big hurrah for heat in the Sydney area' Hot dog: The hot weather was too much for this pooch, who took a dip to cool down on Friday He added that the highest ever peak demand for energy came in February 2011, when 14,600KW of energy was pumped out to homes and businesses. 'What they are initially thinking today is that electricity supply might reach 14700KW - a statewide record,' Mr O'Brien said. 'On a peak summer's day, every home uses twice as much power as it normally does.' EnergyAustralia Chief Customer Officer Kim Clarke warned people to have a plan in place for if their power fails. 'The high levels of electricity demand driven by extreme heat place the network under significant stress, increasing the chances of network outages,' she said. 'Your best source of information for power outages in your area is your electricity distributor.' The warning came as the mercury was set to rise to 44C on Friday, with a record-breaking three-day heatwave for large chunks of the state. Police and Emergency Services Minister Troy Grant warned of 'catastrophic conditions' and fire chiefs said they were on 'heightened' alert. Mr Grant urged people to stay safe and to keep an eye on children playing near water following a 'tragic' summer of drownings. The temperatures could reach 48C over the weekend, smashing records and leaving millions of people sweltering. Total fire bans have already been declared for three regions in NSW on Friday, the Southern Ranges, the Southern Slopes and southern Riverina. With temperatures tipped to rise above 40C, the RFS expects total fires bans and extreme or severe fire danger warnings will be in place across most of the state. 'If the forecast eventuates we're likely to see catastrophic fire danger develop in some areas including the Hunter,' NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said in a statement.
