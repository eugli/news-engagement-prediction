She said education is your future, education is everything. \n“Therefore, my whole political life was mainly focused on education,” he said. \nNext month, Dr Ling will be appointed as the university’s first chancellor at the Utar Kampar campus in Perak. \nHis existing position as Utar Council chairman which he has held since October 2002 will be handed over to Tan Sri Dr Ting Chew Peh at the same ceremony on March 18. \nThe new position is in honour of Dr Ling’s immense contributions to the university that was set up in 2002, after receiving the green light from the Government in July 2001. \nThe setting up of Utar was a 30-year-old dream fulfilled by MCA, and the party had attributed this achievement to Dr Ling, then MCA president, for his persistent endeavour and lobbying in the previous three years. \nDr Ling’s duties as the chancellor will include acting as an advocate of the university to enhance its profile and reputation at national and global levels, assuming the ambassadorial role for the university, and presiding at all major ceremonies of the university and conferring degrees. \nIn an interview on Thursday, Dr Ling discussed at length the projects that he had carried out for Utar. He spoke passionately about the Miracle Baby Programme (MBP), a non-profit project by Utar Hospital for babies with congenital heart disease, the Gift of Sight and Gift of Hearing projects for school children with vision and hearing problems.\nHe said a memorandum of understanding was signed with a university in Raipur, India, to make Utar the centre for congenital heart cases in the Asean region, following his visit to Raipur. \nBoth in India and Malaysia, 1% of the babies born have congenital heart disease, which could be fatal if not given urgent treatment.\n“We can cure all of them if we have trained doctors, but we don’t. We only have three to five paediatric congenital heart specialists who work very hard but the waiting list is too long. Most of the babies die while on the waiting list. This is very sad,” he said.\nDr Ling hopes to launch this project by year-end and is waiting for funding. \n“To save a life could mean saving a great genius,” he said. \nBoth the Gift of Sight and Gift of Hearing programmes enlisted Utar students to help identify school kids who need spectacles and hearing aids when they visit villages for community service. \nDr Ling said the hearing aid project has yet to kick off, pending the sponsorship of an audiometer. \nUtar, which is largely built and sustained by public donations, offers more than 110 academic programmes from Foundation Studies to Bachelor’s, Master’s and PhD. To date, it has produced more than 48,000 graduates. \nDr Ling attributed the students’ accomplishments to their own hard work and the dedication of their parents and teaching staff. \nDr Ling is being too humble about his contributions to Utar, said former student representative in the student council Kent Chan, 32, who is vouching for Dr Ling’s influence on his student life. \nDescribing Dr Ling as an elder who does not distance himself from the students, Chan had met Dr Ling at school activities and decided to seek his help to organise a Chinese New Year carnival when he was in Year Two. \nTogether with two other friends, Chan paid Dr Ling a visit at his office in the then Petaling Jaya campus to chat about the carnival, and in the end Dr Ling offered to get sponsorship and equipment for a lion dance performance for the students, and later attended the carnival together with his wife. \nWhen they graduated and got their first pay cheque, Chan and his friends bought him lunch. \n“I will remember him for always advising us not to be afraid to try,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:09:47.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
