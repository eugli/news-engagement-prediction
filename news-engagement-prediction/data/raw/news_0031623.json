Barack and Michelle left the White House with a high approval rating. People love them. They’re the two greatest people in the world . \nWhatever. \nJust go away for 2017. That would be a great start. \nUnfortunately, Michelle can’t stay out of the limelight. \nShe’ll be appearing on “MasterChef Junior.” \nFrom Conservative Tribune : \nAccording to Entertainment Weekly , Michelle Obama — former first lady and dedicated enemy of taco Tuesday — will be joining the show “MasterChef Junior” as a guest judge. \n“MasterChef Junior,” for the uninitiated, is a Fox cooking competition where Gordon Ramsay — a bullying celebrity chef/hyperkinetic waste of carbon and prescription amphetamines from the British Isles — berates unfortunate children for fun and profit. \nThe Los Angeles Times reports that other guest judges will include Martha Stewart and a few of the Muppets. When you consider the three-year jail sentence Fozzie Bear served on a wocka-wocka-wrongful death conviction, that makes Michelle Obama the only judge mentioned to have not done prison time. \nWho can’t wait to tune in? \nAnyone?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T03:30:10.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
