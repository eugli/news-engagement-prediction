She was not kidnapped … she also had consensual sex with them and was not forced to. Actually, the girl asked my clients to give her an iPhone and pay her money to go out with them. She had also been in contact with the suspects on WhatsApp,” Makki said.\nThe girl had testified that the brothers and their uncle forced her into their car when she was walking in front of her residence.\n“The pulled me into the car and sandwiched me in the backseat. They drove to a desert area … they undressed and raped me one at a time. One of them muzzled me while the other raped me. I tried to resist at first but then I got tired. I had met the uncle six times near my house,” she said.\nIn her defence argument, Makki said: “Had the girl been forced to ride the suspects’ car, then why didn’t she cry for help and try to run away since she was in a crowded area! She had agreed in advance to meet my clients at 4.30pm that day … she jumped into their car at her own will. The girl also testified in court that she had requested an iPhone to meet the suspects … this is a proof that she went with them willingly. The forensic report confirmed that there were no bruises or injuries on her body, the fact which eliminates her claims that she had been raped. She had also told the uncle that it was her father who had raped her and made her lose her virginity … she also had claimed to the suspects that she was used to having sex with men for money.”\nPresiding judge Bin Sarm confirmed the primary court’s decision to place the brothers under judicial probation for having had consensual sex with the girl.\nThe girl’s civil lawsuit was also dismissed.\nWednesday’s ruling remains subject to appeal before the Cassation Court within 30 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:45:37.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
