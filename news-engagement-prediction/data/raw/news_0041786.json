But Buttigieg’s performance was so impressive that the Federal Reserve official who created the contest pulled his teacher aside. \n“Who was that?” he asked macroeconomics teacher Julie Chismar. \nOthers have been asking the same thing recently after Buttigieg — now 35 and the mayor of South Bend — joined the crowded race to head the Democratic National Committee. \nThe next question they ask is: How do you pronounce his name? \nIt’s BOOT-edge-edge. \n“Luckily elections are usually multiple-choice,” he says of his difficult last name. \nButtigieg was a late entrant last month in the race to be decided this coming Saturday in Atlanta. The early front-runners were former Labor secretary Tom Perez — a favorite of the Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton camps — and Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, who has the backing of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \nBut he’s gotten a lot of buzz as someone who could come right through the middle of that establishment vs. insurgent divide in the party. \n“The DNC is looking for a real change,” said former DNC chairman Howard Dean, who has not endorsed a candidate. “I was speaking at a Yale Young Democrats meeting (the other) night and that’s all they wanted to talk about — Pete.” \nWhat people like most about Buttigieg is he defies stereotypes, said Joe Andrew, who is one of four former DNC chairs who have endorsed the South Bend mayor, the most of any candidate. Buttigieg wouldn’t just be the youngest and first openly gay DNC chair. He’s also a Rhodes Scholar and an officer in the U.S. Navy Reserve who worked for the high-powered consulting firm McKinsey before becoming mayor of a Rust Belt city. \nThe candidates have been selling similar platforms at the forums. All, for example, are emphasizing the need to build the Democrats’ bench, get back to the grass roots, fight voter suppression and pay attention to redistricting. \nCandidates for Democratic National Committee chair, from left, Sally Boynton Brown, Keith Ellison, Jehmu Greene, Pete Buttigieg and Ray Buckley stand during the DNC Future of the Party Forum on Jan. 14, 2017, in Phoenix.

If we’re saying we've got to pay attention from the top of the ticket on down, put in a mayor — someone whose bread and butter is local office,\" Buttigieg said at one of the regional forums. \"And if we’re all saying that the solutions for our party are not going to come from Washington, put in somebody that does not get up in the morning and go to work in Washington every day.\" \nButtigieg’s parents weren’t politically connected, but they were politically conscious. Dinner-table talk covered world events. Between those conversations and the social consciousness he developed through the Catholic social teachings at St. Joseph’s and from being involved with Amnesty International, Buttigieg decided “I had to go out and make myself useful.” \nAfter studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar, Buttigieg worked for McKinsey, the management strategy consulting firm. \nIn 2010 he ran for state treasurer, a down-ballot race that would have been an uphill battle for any unknown Indiana Democrat even before a backlash to President Obama and the rise of the Tea Party made it a banner GOP year. \nHe got clobbered: 35.7% to Republican Richard Mourdock’s 62.5%. \n“That was how I really learned politics,” Buttigieg said. \nRead more:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T19:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T14:16:23.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
