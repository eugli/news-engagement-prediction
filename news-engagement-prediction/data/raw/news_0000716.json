Lower courts had ruled POM could not sue Coke under the Lanham Act because FDA regulations already apply to—and allow—such labeling.\nIt's important to note here that—unlike the USDA—the FDA doesn't pre-approve food labels. Also, the agency has its own enforcement mechanisms in place in the event it deems any food to be misbranded.\nThe Lanham Act, meanwhile, allows suits in cases of certain conflicts between business competitors.\nThat overlap can create a situation in which the FDA thinks a label is perfectly fine, but a court can decide just the opposite. That's exactly what POM hopes will happen here.\nThere's been growing acknowledgement in legal circles that Lanham Act claims can conflict with FDA regulations.\nThese conflicts—if allowed to proceed—could prove costly for businesses.\nWiley Rein, a large law firm that filed an amicus brief in the case, cautions that these sorts of food-labeling lawsuits under the Lanham Act would create \"overlapping layers of potentially inconsistent regulation.\"\n\"If Pom wins, food labels could come under increasing legal scrutiny, and it's possible many of them won’t fare well,\" writes Businessweek's Susan Berfield.\nMost reports this week, citing oral arguments, paint the case as a slam dunk for POM.\n\"Coca-Cola didn't get much love from the Supreme Court on Monday,\" reads USA Today 's lede.\n\"Legal Experts Expect Supreme Court Will Rule in Favor of Pom,\" predicts an Ad Age headline.\nMany of these reports focus on the Justices' references to a need to protect consumers against deceptive food marketing.\n\"I think it’s relevant for us to ask whether people are cheated in buying the product,\" Justice Anthony Kennedy said during oral arguments. \"Because Coca-Cola's position is to say even if they are, there’s nothing we can do about it.\"\nOther comments from the bench were no more encouraging for Coke.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:38:08.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
