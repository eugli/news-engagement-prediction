However, during a news conference today, Trump called Flynn “a wonderful man” who had been treated “unfairly” by the “fake media.” \n“The media, of course, did not fire General Flynn,” Tapper noted. “President Trump did.” \nHe continued, “What the media did do was reveal to the nation that General Flynn had lied to the country and to the Trump team — including Vice President Pence — when he claimed he never discussed Obama’s sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador.” \nThe CNN anchor would go on to discuss Trump’s recent Twitter attacks on the “fake news” media’s “conspiracy theories” by pointing to POTUS publicly embracing conspiracy theories in the past. Tapper would also argue that in the past Trump had no problem with leaks when they benefited him. \nWatch the clip above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:33:03.261+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
