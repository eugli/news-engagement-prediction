So my head is still pounding,\" the Cruel Intentions actress, 44, captioned the post. \"I drove away from a gas pump with the nozzle still in. I was chastised for wearing fur but that was weird cause it was teddy bear fur. And then I paid for the broken pump so that was over a 500 dollar tank of gas. Felt awful for being so absent minded.\" PHOTOS: Celebrity Health Scares \nBlair continued, \"Then I burst into tears in front of [a] barista after ordering and made everyone uncomfortable. Still crying. And I ran out of dog food. And excedrin. Can I have someone say this will pass? #waytogo #crapday #stillgrateful #makemelaughplease #timetoplaywithmylittleone.\" Selma Blair in Los Angeles (February 2, 2017). WENN.com \nSeveral Instagram users commented on the Hellboy star's post with messages of encouragement as she reflected on her bad day. \"Days like that u just go home have a nice hot bath, get in ur pj's, munch on junk food, get into bed and watch a hilerous [sic] movie,\" one fan wrote. Another added, \"Tomorrow will be a much better day.
