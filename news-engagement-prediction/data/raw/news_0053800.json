The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is said to have put forward this proposal to the teams during a half-a-day workshop in Bengaluru on Tuesday (February 21). \nSources said the board will foot the expenses of those eight ceremonies. \"This year is special because it's the 10th season and the teams were told about the plan for having 'opening ceremonies at home' during the interaction,\" a source told TOI. A board official confirmed the move and said \"the picture will get clearer after the tender process is complete\". \nThe team owners expressed their wish to engage more fans and make IPL bigger and better than the previous years. It was revealed that the IPL franchises were satisfied that there was no BCCI office bearers to take a call. \"For the first time in nine years, the teams felt (at the auction) that the league belongs to them and this is very special feeling,\" a team official, who attended the workshop, said. \nIt means that when the BCCI and the team owners sit together in the future to decide on the future course of action, there will be no unanimous decisions. The team owners too will have a say in all important matters. \nIncidentally, this workshop was earlier planned by the ousted board officials to be conducted in London. After consulting the Committee of Administrators (COA), BCCI made it clear that there was no need to incur extra expenditure and that the workshop could be held in the country itself. \nWith the board's style of working having undergone a drastic change, the teams are confident of amicably solving issues if and when they arise. © TNN ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:12:08.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
