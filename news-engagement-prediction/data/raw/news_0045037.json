Cuevas and her family decided to do the same. Suddenly the ice cracked and the teens plunged into the frigid water -- a terrifying incident Cuevas captured on video. \"My daughter and husband ... ran for ladders and started pulling people out,\" she said. Police say seven teens were trying to take pictures when the ice gave way Monday evening.

When the fire department responded, most of the teens had come out of the water, firefighter Eddie Long said. All seven patients were taken to a hospital in serious condition, Long said. They were treated for hypothermia but all were expected to survive, he said.
