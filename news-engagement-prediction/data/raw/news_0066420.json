The capability for the characters is ready for you from the first time you turn your computer on. The Easiest Way To Type Accented Letters on a Mac \nIf you have a newer Mac (OS X Lion and later), you're in luck. It provides what may be the easiest way in computing today to type accented letters without using a keyboard made specifically for Spanish. \nThe method uses the Mac's built-in spelling correction software . It will seem familiar if you've ever had to type an accented letter on a cellphone, either Mac or Android. \nIf you have a letter that needs a diacritical mark, simply hold the key down longer than usual and a pop-up menu will appear. Simply click on the correct symbol and it will insert itself in what you're typing. \ncontinue reading below our video 10 Best Universities in the United States \nIf the method doesn't work, it may be because the software you're using (such as a word processor) doesn't take advantage of the feature built into to the operating system. It is also possible that you may have the key repeat function turned off. The Traditional Way To Type Accented Letters on a Mac \nIf the method above doesn't work, here's another way — it isn't intuitive, but it is easy to master. The key is that to type a modified letter (such as an é , ü or ñ ) you type a special key combination followed by the letter. For example, to type vowels with an acute accent on them (namely the á , é , í , ó and ú ) press the Option key and the \"e\" key at the same time, then release the keys. This tells your computer that the next letter will have the acute accent. So to type á , press the Option key and the \"e\" at the same time, release those keys, and then type the \"a.\" If you want it capitalized, the process is the same, except press the \"a\" and the shift key at the same time. \nThe process is similar for the other special letters. To type the ñ , press the Option and \"n\" keys at the same time and release them, then press the \"n.\" To type the ü , press the Option and \"u\" keys at the same time and release them, then press the \"u.\" \nTo summarize: Á — Option + e, Shift + a é — Option + e, e É — Option + e, Shift + e í — Option + e, i Í — Option + e, Shift + i ñ — Option + n, n Ñ — Option + n, Shift + n ó — Option + e, o Ó — Option + e, Shift + o ú — Option + e, u Ú — Option + e, Shift + u ü — Option + u, u Ü — Option + u, Shift + u \nTo type Spanish punctuation, it is necessary to press two or three keys at the same time. Here are the combinations to learn: inverted question mark ( ¿ ) — Shift + Option + ? inverted exclamation point ( ¡ ) — Option + 1 left angle quote ( « ) — Option + \\ right angle quote ( » ) — Shift + Option + \\ quotation dash ( — ) — Shift + Option + - Using the Mac Character Palette To Type Accented Letters \nSome versions of the Mac OS also offer an alternate method, known as the Character Palette, that is more cumbersome than the above method but can be used if you forget the key combinations. To open the Character Palette if you have it available, open the Input menu on the top right of the menu bar to find it. Within the Character Palette, select Accented Latin for the characters to display. You can insert the characters in your document by double-clicking on them. In some versions of the Mac OS, the Character Palette may also be available by clicking on the Edit menu of your word-processing or other application and selecting Special Characters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:46:21.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
