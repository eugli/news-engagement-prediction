But, we have revised the design and the new plan would see shedding of 300 to 500 trees,” Fadnavis had said then. While the CM promised to re-look into the issue of the number of trees that would be affected, he refused to commit on the shift the project to either Kalina or Kanjurmarg.\nAccording to the environmentalists, the southern end of the Kalina Campus, which is spread across 29 hectares, will be more than sufficient for the Metro car shed. “When we suggested the Kanjurmarg area, he said it’s a marsh land. But, the land there is ready for use,” added Dayanand.\nThe activists said that they had requested the CM to provide a written confirmation about considering their demand, but Fadnavis politely refused. He has, however, asked MMRDA chief Ashwini Bhide to meet the environmentalists again.\nActivist and filmmaker Ram Subramanium said, “We will only vote for the party that promises to save the trees in Aarey.” Despite repeated attempts, the MMRDA chief was unavailable for comment.\nIn his concluding rally yesterday, Raj Thackeray said, “The government can set up the carshed at BPT, but they want to sell off prime land to developers and hence, are exploiting the forest at Aarey.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:57:15.073+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
