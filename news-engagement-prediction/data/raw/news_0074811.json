Who cares that he’s not French? He’s Barack Obama.” \nThere is even a website, and 500 posters have gone up all over Paris: \nThere is even an online petition (tr. by Google) asking Obama to run: \nYES WE CAN ! The French are ready to make radical choices. That is good because we have a radical idea to propose to them. After a phantom quinquennium and faced with the announced failure of the next presidential election, we think it is time to move on to the 6th Republic to get France out of its lethargy. To launch this 6th Republic, we wish to strike a blow by electing a foreign President at the head of our beautiful country. Barack Obama has completed his second term as President of the United States on January 21, why not hire him as President for France? Our goal is simple, to collect before the 15th of March, 1 million voting promises to convince Barack Obama to run for the presidential election of May 2017. – Barack Obama has the best resume in the world for the job. – Because it is still possible to vote for a President and not against a candidate. – Because at a time when France is about to vote massively for the extreme right, we can still give a lesson of democracy to the planet by electing a French President, a foreigner. \nMany Americans would have liked to have had President Obama run for a third term in the United States. It is hardly a surprise that some in France would want him as their president as well. Obama’s accomplishments were always recognized in Europe. \nPew Global shows Obama’s popularity in France as of 2016 a strong 84, above even that of the UK and just behind Germany’s 86. And whereas 77 percent of Europeans had the confidence Obama would do the right thing in foreign affairs, fully 85 percent lacked confidence Trump would. \nIt is a fun scenario to envision, a little harmless wishful thinking and a great compliment to one of the most successful – and popular – presidents in United States history. And it would be a nice return on France’s investment in helping America gain its independence. \nVive la belle France .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:30:59.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
