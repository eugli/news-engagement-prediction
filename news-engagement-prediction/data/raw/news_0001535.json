Matt Shand inspects the \"Fawlty Towers\" of Rotorua aka, the Silver Oaks Heritage Resort . \nOPINION: Some hotels age like fine wine, others like rotten eggs. The Silver Oaks Heritage Resort has been labelled the \"Fawlty Towers\" and the \"Bates Motel\"of Rotorua, with its 1.5 star rating and 148 1-star reviews on TripAdvisor. Complaints of mouldy rooms, dodgy electrics, and dirty linen prevail, but can the internet really be trusted? Matt Shand takes a closer look at Rotorua's comedy motel and reviews the reviews. \nPutting the negative reviews out of my mind for the Silver Oaks Resort Heritage was no easy feat, mainly because the room smells of feet. \nAn exceptionally friendly man behind the counter, who had no name badge but who I nickname Basil (as in Fawlty), provided a key to suite 16. Thduo1 stayed here a month ago and said, \"The apartment was spacious but smelly and dirty. The furniture was old and the door cabinet in the living room was broken.\" This review gets a thumbs up from me. MATT SHAND/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe Silver Oaks Heritage Resort has a bad rep online. We went to check it out for ourselves. \nREAD MORE * Rotorua resort 'very unsafe for a family' It is hard to tell sometimes where Rotorua ends and the smell of mould begins, but it was about at the door. A musk of unbooted feet after a hard romp around the paddock lingers. You get used to it. The trick is not to leave the room. Not that there is much reason to do so, as Cathyturner17 gives another spot-on 1-star review. \"While this place looks nice from the road, it's actually very neglected and in need of refurbishment. The advertised gym doesn't exist, the heated pool is cold, the mini golf is worn and in need of repair.\" Restaurant? Closed. Bar? Closed. Spa? Shut. Gym? Locked, but a glance in the window revealed a tiny room with two treadmills stacked against the wall next to two rusted out barbecues and gas bottles. Pool? Yes but bugs keen on \"checking out early\" have used it as their final resting place. Mini golf? Exists. Win. Since news broke about the establishment's cleanliness someone has taken a good mop to the place. Curtains appear new, or at least newly drycleaned, and the surfaces are pretty well kept. Bedspreads are extremely dated but serviceable, and linen appears clean. \nBut it didn't take long for the cracks, literal and figurative, to show. \nOne reviewer has even called on the Rotorua Council to close the hotel down after her horrific stay, saying her son had an asthma attack due to the conditions. She alleged all sorts of failings, including dubious stains and smears, an exploding kettle, strewn rubbish and dirty towels. It appears at least some of her concerns were founded and water damage might be to blame. MATT SHAND/FAIRFAX NZ \nWater appears to have damaged furniture in the rooms. \nThe water heater in the lounge has a long brown streak running down the wall from where it has leaked from the radiator heater control and into the floor and wallpaper. Moving into the kitchen, the reason for the smell becomes more apparent. The cupboards appear to have been soaked in water and bulge outwards, making them hard to open. The problem persists on the bottom of the cupboards as well, and the skirting. Lifting up some bubbled wallpaper reveals black spots. \nIf the kitchen was flooded it has seeped into the floors as well. The carpet leading into the master bedroom was flecking away at the edges and the wood underneath showing sings of waterlogging. This room was on the top floor so it remains a mystery where that water has gone after its trip through the carpet. \nIt was about now my throat started to swell, also being susceptible to damp, so it was back to Basil to see what could be done. Basil is true to his namesake in that he appears to be trying to hold things together in a building that is falling apart. Many reviews made reference to the management being very good as a plus side to their visit, and those reviewers get a big thumbs up. MATT SHAND/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe spa pool at the Silver Oaks Heritage Resort. \nAfter a bit of time he decided an upgrade to greener pastures in a spa suite was in order, so a key exchange was made and it was off to room 10. Ad Feedback \nThis room had a lot more punch. So much so two punch marks were proudly displayed on the walls, another common point made in reviews. \nAgain the mildew smell remained and again the kitchen housed the same problem: bulging cupboard doors and waterlogged floors. Why? Maybe it had something to do with taps apparently being set to \"commercial fire hose\", sending water everywhere on the first try. Peeling paper in the bathroom, taped down to the walls, and a few pock marks from chipping paint were the only other cosmetic issues with the room. The spa area was nice, and the little peace garden was a treat, but I would not be submerging flesh into stained spa waters anytime soon. MATT SHAND/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe door looks a bit worn. \nThe TV decided it was bedtime about 9.30pm. It could be roused by holding the antenna connection at the wall upwards, but not for long. Suddenly I feel quite itchy. At least the bed is comfortable enough. \nScratch that. A middle of the night wake-up with an aching back changes the previous comment. The floor is far superior. \nBut there is another more pressing problem. The bright lights that ring the resort are strong enough to flood through the drawn curtains. The full-moon effect could almost be romantic but one struggles to think of the alcohol involved to turn this setting into a honeymoon suite. \nThere is little doubt the Silver Oaks Resort Heritage used to be a jewel to stay in, but time has been a a cruel mistress and the place is in dire need of an overhaul. It is a shame to not be staying here in its glory days, but you can't live on past merits forever. \nCoupled with advertised services on site that do not exist, such as the bar, gym, and unusable tennis courts, it is hard to give it full respect. \nThe room cost ranges between $90 and $300 a night, with Suite 16, an 80 square metre room, costing us $112 on Booking.com. At that price, some of the finishing can maybe be forgiven, but given the choice you may decide to head further down the road. \nIs it bad enough to be closed down? That is really up to the marketplace. Leaving the next morning, several rooms had repairmen inside working on plastering and painting the place. Perhaps a sign this old dog is trying to shake off the cobwebs? - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:19:43.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
