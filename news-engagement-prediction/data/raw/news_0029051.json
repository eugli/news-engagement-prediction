Repeat this is not a drill,” the National Weather Service said Sunday, urging people living below Oroville Dam to evacuate. The evacuation was ordered because of a “hazardous situation” involving the Northern California dam's emergency spillway. The National Weather Service said the auxiliary spillway is expected to fail and could send an “uncontrolled release of flood waters from Lake Oroville.” Feb. 12, 2017, 6:47 p.m. Sandbags and rocks will be used to try to plug a hole in Oroville Dam's emergency spillway Matt Hamilton Water flows into the emergency spillway at Lake Oroville (Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times) \nAfter discovering a hole in Oroville Dam's emergency spillway, officials said late Sunday that they will attempt to plug it using sandbags and rocks. But they stressed the situation remains dangerous and urged thousands of residents downstream to evacuate to higher ground. \nVideo from television helicopters Sunday evening showed water flowing into a parking lot next to the dam, with large flows going down both the damaged main spillway and the emergency spillway. \nThey also showed lines of cars getting out of downtown Oroville. An evacuation center was set up at the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds in Chico. \nOfficials feared a failure of the emergency spillway could cause huge amounts of water to flow into the Feather River, which runs through downtown Oroville, and other waterways. The result could be flooding and levee failures for miles south of the dam, depending on how much water is released.
