Dollar General (NYSE: DG) has acquired 103 acres from the Montgomery County Industrial Development Agency for $1.545 million. The land will be used to build a distribution hub that will employ 430 people to store and ship merchandise to 800 stores throughout the Northeast. Dollar General, the nation's second largest discount retail chain, has confirmed plans to… more EMILE WAMSTEKER The 750,000-square-foot warehouse will be Dollar General's 16th distribution center. The company completed construction of a center in Janesville, Wisconsin, last year. The discount retailer also is building its 15th distribution center in Jackson, Georgia. Dollar General selected the site in Montgomery County , about 35 miles west of Albany, because of its proximity to Exit 27 off Interstate 90. The company had considered buying land about an hour away in Wilton in Saratoga County, but walked away from that location for reasons that remain unclear. The Wilton property, which has some wetland issues to contend with, would have cost about $5 million more than the site in Montgomery County. \"To bring in some 400 jobs is huge for the county,\" said Ken Rose , director of the Montgomery County Business Development Center. The average salary of the employees at the distribution center will be about $34,000. That is about $10,000 a year higher than the average household income in the town of Florida. The 1.5-mile corridor along Route 5S now is home to several large distribution and warehouse sites, including a Target distribution center, Hill & Markes and a Beech-Nut food baby food factory. Rose said the county has approximately 70 acres of land available for development, and there are plans to search for additional acreage to attract more businesses. He has been working with representatives of Dollar General since spring 2015 when the company made its first site visit. Montgomery County is located along the Erie Canal and Interstate 90. For decades, the area was a hub for manufacturing. Carpet and textile companies operated factories there, and Cabbage Patch doll maker Coleco employed hundreds of workers until the company ran into financial problems after a failed attempt to enter the home computer market. The population has followed the same trend as many upstate communities over the past 50 years. As employers left the area, the population declined by more than 13 percent between 1960 and 2015. Today, the county is home to 49,642 people. Florida town supervisor Eric Mead talked last fall about how the community received a boost a decade ago when Target built a distribution center that employs approximately 750 people in the Florida Industrial Park. Mead said the Dollar General project will bring more jobs to a community that continues to rely heavily on agriculture. Dollar General has hired Clayco Inc. of Illinois as the general contractor for the Montgomery County distribution center. Leo A Daly of Omaha, Nebraska, is the architectural engineering firm and Elan Design is the civil engineering firm. Robin K. Cooper covers manufacturing, health care and sports business.
