The sequence showed the Cats are more than capable of defending the way their coach wants. \n\"When we do clap I feel like it actually does help us,\" said Dominique Hawkins . \"It gets us ready for the possession and everybody starts talking and gelling together. I feel like there's times where we don't even need to clap to have energy. We'll go down and everybody says, 'We need this one stop,' and we'll get it.\" \nThe game was shaping up to be Kentucky's best defensive performance perhaps since its blowout win over Texas A&M way back on Jan. 3. Alabama started just 11 of 35 from the field, obviously bothered by UK's length and athleticism. The Cats blocked six shots on the day, five before halftime. \nThen the winds shifted, just as they have in what is now nine straight second halves that UK opponents have shot better than 50 percent from the field. The Tide made 12 of 16 shots over last 13 minutes, including eight straight field goal attempts as it whittled away at Kentucky's once decisive lead. \nThe parallel to UK's win over LSU earlier in the week was apparent. The Tigers closed the game 11 of 15 from the field, 7 of 9 from 3-point range over the last eight minutes. \n\"I guess there’s times we do relax on defense in the second half, but everybody on the team knows that defense is the key in the way we’re about to win the game,\" Hawkins said. \"If we just keep continue to fight it out to the end of the game we’ll be able to win by a big margin.\" \nStill, there was noticeable improvement from a team having tons of trouble merely staying in front of opponents over the past few weeks. And still, there's progress to be made. \n\"We still aren't taking charges. We got guys that won't throw their body in there,\" Calipari said. \"Defensively, the breakdowns were more individual. ‘Why are you leaving your feet? They’ve made made one three and a banked three, and you keep leaving your feet on ball fakes.’… 'Why did you foul?' And then the fouls are and-ones. So you’re not even fouling good. Foul him if you’re going to foul him and get your fourth foul – not an and-one. So we’ve got so much stuff to work on.\" \nEven with its defense dissolving late in back-to-back games, Kentucky is clearly trending in the right direction on that end of the floor. There are issues to address, but to listen to Briscoe tell it, those deficiencies are UK's sole focus on the court right now. \n\"With this team I really don't worry about offense,\" Briscoe said. \"We're so talented. Everybody can score, everybody can get it off the dribble. It's just focusing on defense and talking and being able to come up with consecutive stops.\" \nKentucky's problems boil down to \"technical stuff,\" as Calipari put it after the game, but the coach didn't seem worried. Every team in the country has issues, he said, and UK just has to be \"better dealing with ours than they are at dealing with theirs.\" \n\"I’ve just got to keep coaching them, and I think I got away from what I needed to do for three weeks and we slipped. Let’s see if I can get these guys on the right path,\" Calipari said. \"Listen, we were worried about just playing hard, showing energy, having the world look at us and say, 'These guys care. These guys can be good defensively.' But they gotta be engaged in it. It's gotta be about defense first, and it was.\" Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:52:55.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
