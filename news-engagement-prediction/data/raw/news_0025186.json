While there are undoubtedly some stellar pieces rattling around the Celtics' cabinets these days — particularly the draft picks from the Brooklyn Nets — the reality of the situation is Boston has nothing to pair with that lottery-based potential. \nDon't believe me? Let's go through Boston's best assets, from the top trade chip to the pieces Danny Ainge hopes you won't investigate too closely before finalizing your transaction. Boston Globe via Getty Images Boston Globe 1 2017 first-round pick swap with the Brooklyn Nets \nThis is the crown jewel of Boston's supposed hoard, and even it comes with significant caveats. First, you don't just get the Nets pick outright; you have to give up your own. While that's worth it for a team late in the lottery or in the playoff hunt, acquiring Brooklyn's pick this year isn't nearly as valuable as it would be without the swap. \nSecond, at this point in time, any team trading for that pick is at the mercy of probability. No matter how bad the Nets are, there's only a 25 percent chance this turns into the first overall pick. \nWhile the Brooklyn pick won't fall any lower than No. 4, the chance you end up with something less than the best-case scenario diminishes the pick's value, as well. 2 Brooklyn's 2018 first-round pick with no protections \nAssuming Brooklyn will be awful for the next several years — and that feels pretty safe — this pick is nearly as valuable as the 2016 selection. You're essentially exchanging the possibility the Nets improve for the right to keep your own pick rather than sending it back to Boston, as with the aforementioned asset. \nYet if the Celtics want to make a big move, they probably have to send both the 2016 and 2018 picks away. And without a guaranteed superstar on the market, Boston's not going to act that rashly. \n--- \nThe Celtics own the Clippers' 2019 first-round pick as well, but for now, it's hard to project what kind of value that asset will have moving forward. 3 Avery Bradley, SG \nBradley's the best player the Celtics would be willing to move in a deal, which isn't really saying much. He provides solid value as a 3-point shooter and a defender, but he's also 26 years old and probably won't get much better than he already is. \nHe's the kind of piece you try to sign in free agency to round out a championship contender, not the centerpiece of a blockbuster trade. 4 Jaylen Brown, SF \nThe 20-year-old Brown is the most intriguing young player in Boston; even I can't ignore his potential upside. Yet there are some in the NBA who compare Brown to James Harden, which is the most misguided comparison I've heard in quite a while. \nThe only similarity is Brown's penchant for drawing contact at the weirdest angles to get to the line. Harden, though, uses his nose for free throw to complement his stellar skills as a playmaker, shooter, and finisher at the rim. Brown doesn't have any of that at all. 5 Jae Crowder, SF \nCeltics fans will tell you how crucial Crowder is to Boston's success, and they're right. He's a fantastic glue guy who does all the little things, plus a few big things when the Celtics need him most. \nLike Bradley, though, Crowder is 26 years old and a better fit on a contender, not a team trading for draft picks and young guys with upside. Ken Blaze Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports 6 Marcus Smart, PG \nA 22-year-old Boston point guard who can't shoot, has flashed anger issues, and doesn't always make the best decisions on the court? \nI've seen how Rajon Rondo's career plays out in the modern NBA. I don't need to see it again with Smart — especially since he can't really pass, either. 7 Kelly Olynyk, PF \n... you know what? No. \nI'm not going to lie to you and say the 25-year-old Olynyk is an asset of any kind. I will not say that about Jordan Mickey, Tyler Zeller, Terry Rozier, or James Young, either. \nThe fact of the matter is Danny Ainge has drafted incredibly poorly over the years, and Boston's roster reflects his poor decision-making. \nIf the Celtics want to be active at the deadline, they either need a frustrated star who wants out or a front office with no idea what it's doing — which means Boston's only hope is to keep chasing Jimmy Butler (sorry, Bulls fans).
