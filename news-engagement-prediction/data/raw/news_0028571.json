Here are professional basketball's five biggest player-driven feuds, ranked by how big of an impact they make on the NBA. 5 Stephen Curry vs. Damian Lillard \nThis being a one-way rivalry doesn't make it any less fun. Lillard hates the idea Curry is the unquestioned best point guard in the NBA, and he brings his very best every time the Blazers face the Warriors. \nIn face, we probably insulted Lillard just by putting his name this close to Curry's. Whatever you do, never, ever compare the two in front of the Portland point guard. \nWho has the upper hand ? Curry. Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports Cary Edmondson 4 Isaiah Thomas vs. Dennis Schroder \nYou might not realize how fierce this feud is unless you have an encyclopedic memory of Celtics-Hawks playoff series, but these two Eastern Conference point guards have gone toe-to-toe on multiple occasions — with Schroder accusing Thomas of some harsh trash-talk. \nWho has the upper hand? Thomas. Boston Globe via Getty Images Jessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff 3 Carmelo Anthony vs. Phil Jackson \nWe know; technically, this isn't a \"player feud,\" since it involves a front office executive. \nThere's no denying the drama playing out between Melo and the Zen Master in the Big Apple, though, so we can't leave this one off the list. \nWho has the upper hand ? The guy with the no-trade clause and all the fan support: Anthony. 2 Russell Westbrook vs. Kevin Durant \nAny questions about whether this rivalry is genuine were settled on Friday, when Westbrook said reconciliation isn't on him — and again when the two barked at each other in the second half of Golden State's big win on Saturday. \nYet for all the noise, Westbrook-Durant comes in second in our book because the team dynamic is so lopsided. It's hard to get too worked up over a feud where one side never stands a chance. \nWho has the upper hand? Basketball-wise? KD. \n\"Not running away to join the enemy\"-wise? You already know. 1 LeBron James vs. Draymond Green \nLeBron low-key taken up real estate in Draymond's head over the past year or so, culminating in Green's Game 5 suspension in the NBA Finals , and the two haven't stopped trying to eliminate each other since. \nWatching the two go at it on the court and in the media is one of the best parts of being a professional basketball fan, and the stakes elevate the spectacle. Best of all, this rivalry doesn't seem to be going anywhere any time soon. \nWho has the upper hand? It's good to be the King ... for now.
