[I'm] not on any sort of benefits and we've got to this point where private insurance won't cover it and I can't manage to get an appointment in the public system.\" \nCDHB planning and funding general manager Carolyn Gullery​ said access to assessments was based on the patient's symptoms and any previous tests they'd had. \n\"If a patient has had diagnostics recently, such as blood tests, or a colonoscopy that has not detected anything of concern, they will be managed in the community setting, which is usually through their own general practice.\" \nGullery said if symptoms changed or worsened, the person's GP could refer them again. \nTaranaki gastroenterologist Dr Campbell White said a specialist assessment with a gastroenterologist would be appropriate for someone who had ongoing and unexplained pain. \nAdditional scans including gastroscopy, MRI and CT scans could be used to assess other parts of the bowel not able to be viewed with a colonoscopy or endoscopy. \nThere was a high demand for specialist services, but not enough gastroenterologists, he said. \n\"In an ideal world everyone with gastro-intestinal symptoms will see a gastroenterologist because they could rule everything out and have a good conversation with them about the diagnosis – and that would be happening if we had unlimited numbers but we don't have those numbers, especially in the public system.\" \nDistrict health boards used their own criteria to determine who could get a specialist appointment, depending on demand and the number of specialised they had. The criteria varied considerably from region to region, White said. \nGovernment figures released this month showed nearly 60,000 New Zealanders were declined a \"first specialist assessment\" – the first step toward receiving surgery – in the last financial year. \nThe figures aimed to measure how many people needed surgery, but did not qualify for an assessment. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:40:37.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
