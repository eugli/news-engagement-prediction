The Câ€™s, however, shot 59.2 percent from the field en route to a 112-104 win over the Utah Jazz that wasnâ€™t as close as the final score would indicate. \nBoston got off to a hot start and never let the Jazz get comfortable, leading by double digits for most of the contest before weathering a late run to secure the win. \nIsaiah Thomas led the Celtics with 29 points, while Kelly Olynyk (19 points, seven rebounds), Gerald Green (16 points) and Al Horford (16 points, nine rebounds) each scored in double figures for the Celtics. Jazz forward Gordon Hayward led all scorers with 31 points. \nWith the win, the Celtics improve to 35-19, while the Jazz fell to 34-21. \nHereâ€™s how it all went down. \nSTARTING FIVE Isaiah Thomas, Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, Amir Johnson, Al Horford \nMISSING STARTERS The Celtics were absent guard Avery Bradley and forward Jae Crowder when they took the floor in Utah on Saturday night. Bradley missed his 16th consecutive game with an Achilles injury that has hampered him since Jan. 6. Crowder missed his second straight game for family reasons but is expected to return for the Celticsâ€™ game with the Dallas Mavericks on Monday night. \nHOT START The Câ€™s had the hot hand to open the game, as they shot 77.8 percent from the field in the first quarter to open up a 10-point lead. Thomas poured in 11 points in the frame, and Olynyk added seven off the bench. Utah got nine points from Hayward to keep it within armâ€™s reach. #Celtics Rewind pres. by @NissanUSA : @smart_MS3 gets steal and finds @KellyOlynyk who beats the buzzer at end of 1st quarter pic.twitter.com/CrvCeWQJHm \nâ€” CSN New England (@CSNNE) February 12, 2017 \nGERALD GREEN TIME Boston continued its hot shooting in the second frame thanks to Greenâ€™s 12 points on 5-of-5 shooting. The Celtics led by 18 midway through the second, but a mini-Utah run allowed the Jazz to cut the lead to 14 at the break. Thomas led all scorers with 15 in the half, while Hayward led the Jazz with 12.

It worked. \nAfter Horford knocked down a 3-pointer, Smart jumped an entry pass on defense, which led to a Thomas 3-pointer. Just like that, the lead had swelled to 20. Moments later, Thomas hit a circus shot in the lane, and James Young followed with a trey of his own. #Celtics Rewind pres. by @NissanUSA : @Isaiah_Thomas falls down, keep dribble alive, and makes the hook shot! pic.twitter.com/YfsV6QbrGX \nâ€” CSN New England (@CSNNE) February 12, 2017 \nThe Jazz made a late run to cut the lead down to six, but it was too little too late, as the Câ€™s were able to salt the game away at the free-throw line. \nPLAY OF THE GAME This blew the game open. #Celtics Rewind pres. by @NissanUSA : @smart_MS3 with the nice defense, leading to the @Isaiah_Thomas pull-up 3! pic.twitter.com/UZrY7OSnJb \nâ€” CSN New England (@CSNNE) February 12, 2017 \nUP NEXT The Celtics will finish their four-game road trip Monday against the Dallas Mavericks.
