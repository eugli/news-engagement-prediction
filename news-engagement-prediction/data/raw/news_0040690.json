Man caught on CCTV scratching 'V' on neighbour's Bentley \nSean Kerr, 52, made a ‘small fortune’ by breeding the puppies in horrific conditions, making them sleep in pitch black sheds covered in faeces and urine then selling them for up to £400. \nMany of the animals were suffering from parvovirus, a potentially deadly virus which led to some of them dying or having to be put down shortly after they went to their new homes. \nWhen RSPCA inspectors visited the squalid kennels they found a dead puppy in a plastic shopping bag, next to old fizzy drinks cans and McDonald’s wrappers in the footwell of a Peugeot van outside.

Nine of them were pregnant, including a shih tzu which was found in a cramped downstairs toilet. \nVideo from the raid shows how the animals suffered with barely any light, limited ventilation and unhygienic conditions while many of them were extremely sick. \n‘Toileting was done in the same area so faeces and urine were present in the same areas as sleeping and living,’ District Judge Shamim Quereshi said when Kerr appeared in court. One of the pregnant dogs was found in a toilet (Picture: SWNS) Inspectors found 37 dogs at the farm (Picture: SWNS) \n‘It was heartrending to hear from [witnesses] that they were looking forward to having the puppy they were buying which ended up either dying or having to be euthanised.’ \nBaby taken into care after father was heard talking about 'benefits of formula milk' One woman, Kim Bradley, bought two puppies for £650 and both died just days later. \nAnita Hutchings purchased a puppy for £325 after she saw it advertised on Pets4Homes, even though she said the puppy stank, had discoloured fur and was lethargic. \n‘She said there was something not quite right about it but she felt it was not getting any care and I think her heart ruled her mind when she decided to buy it,’ the judge said. \n‘With Miss Hutchings, it was a sinister motive [from Kerr] to hope that she would give you the money and then have the puppy dead within a couple of hours of buying. \n‘People thought they were buying from a caring home. They felt duty bound to care for a puppy, expecting that nobody else was going to care for them.’ Inspectors found a dead puppy in a plastic bag (Picture: SWNS) Many of the dogs had parvovirus (Picture: SWNS) The RSPCA acted following a tip-off (Picture: SWNS) \nDistrict Judge Shamim Quereshi said: ‘Mr Kerr was motivated by a devious desire to keep the virus (parvovirus) quiet and avoid problems with the authorities rather than any genuine concern for the death of the puppy or its effect on a new owner. \nTrump reassures everyone by saying he wants to avoid a 'nuclear holocaust' ‘I have to sentence you considering the fact that you were earning a small fortune. \n‘You have sold these puppies using different names and mobile numbers. The whole operation was one of high levels of deceit.’ \nShe said Mr Kerr knew full well his animals were ill and ‘was hoping the buyer would be naive or sentimental enough to buy it whilst he pocketed the profits.’ Sean Kerr, 51 and Louise St John Paulton, 42, leaving Birmingham Magistrates Court at a previous hearing (Picture: SWNS) The dogs had no separate area to go to the toilet and were sitting in urine and faeces (Picture: SWNS) \n‘I reject any notion that an animal left with an illness copes with it and therefore does not suffer.’ \nGovernmental think tank proposes 'chill days' and 52 week paid sick days Henry Spooner, defending, said: ‘He is of good character and there is no suggestion that the dogs suffered from any cruel treatment.’ \nLouise St John Poulton, 42, was deemed unfit to stand trial as she was in hospital with a diabetes related illness. She is expected to stand trial at a later date. \nKerr was found guilty of six counts of unnecessary suffering to dogs and three counts relating to improper animal welfare following a trial at Birmingham Magistrate’s Court. \nAs well as being jailed, Kerr, now of Stoke-on-Trent, was also ordered to pay £30,000 in costs, an £80 victim surcharge, and was banned from keeping dogs for life.
