The Bill will introduce new powers to tackle the scourge of mobile phones sneaked into prisons by jamming them to stamp out their use to organise crime, terrorise victims and post videos on social media. Her plan involves £1.3billion investment in new prisons over five years, with plans for 2,500 officers, and more mandatory drug tests. The wide-ranging Prisons and Courts Bill will bring together a number of reforms announced in recent months as prisons were hit by record levels of violence and suicides, riots and spiralling drug use Ministers will make it easier for domestic violence victims to qualify for legal aid to fight family court battles against abusive partners. And violent husbands will be banned from interrogating their ex-wives in court after a string of cases in which abusers were given free rein to torment victims. Compensation for minor whiplash injuries in car accidents will be banned or capped under the plans, in a bid to cut fraudulent claims which push up millions of motorists’ insurance premiums. There will be a roll-out of ‘virtual’ court hearings held via video or telephone conferencing, such as bail applications, to allow victims to take part without running the risk of coming face-to-face with their assailant. And a new system will allow those charged with less serious criminal offences such as fare-dodging to plead guilty online to save court time. Miss Truss said: ‘Prison is about punishing people who have committed heinous crimes, but it should be a place where offenders are given the opportunity to turn their lives around. ‘I want our prisons to be places of discipline, hard work and self-improvement, where staff are empowered to get people off drugs, improve their English and maths get a job on release.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T08:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:19:45.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
