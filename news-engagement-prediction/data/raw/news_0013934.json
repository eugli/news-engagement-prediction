That’s when all hell broke loose: David Wagner…..pmsl…. pic.twitter.com/yoLeC2tjYt \n— Chris D'Cunha (@DHuncle) February 5, 2017 \nMonk and Wagner earned red cards for their role in the scuffle. Two players – Elias Kachunga of Huddersfield and Pontus Jansson of Leeds – also saw yellow cards for joining in the brawl. \nIt didn’t quite end there though, as Monk used the post-match press conference to let everyone know exactly why he was upset with Wagner. \n“I can only speak for myself but my world and the world I was brought up in, you have to show humility and respect and a little bit of class,” Monk said, according to The Guardian . “When I don’t see that, I take it upon myself to put that right. I hold those values dear, I live by my values and I expect my players to uphold those values too. If someone else doesn’t show that, it doesn’t mean you have to accept it.” \nWagner, of course, saw it differently. Though he did vow to be more mindful of what might upset fellow managers in the future, he explained that he has come up in a different soccer culture where what he did shouldn’t have been viewed as disrespectful. \n“I have a different opinion,” he said after the match . “This is because I grew up in a different football culture. In Germany it is not disrespectful if you celebrate with your players. But I am in England and I have to respect British football culture. What, for me, is disrespectful in Germany and in England as well is if you try to battle the other manager. This is a lack of respect.” \nWhew. This chapter of the saga is over, and Wagner can be satisfied with his club’s 2-1 win, but one thing is for sure: The next Leeds vs. Huddersfield match will be one to watch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:32:32.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
