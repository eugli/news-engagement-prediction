But, what if you have a fetish for long tours and a bit of off-roading, there are options like the Royal Enfield Himalayan. Sure, one is 250cc and the other has engine capacity over 400cc, but read on to compare power figures and other features and be convinced why we think there are enough plausible reasons to pit these two different identities. \nEngine \nKTM 250 Duke comes with a 250 cc liquid cooled, single-cylinder engine that churns out 28 hp of power and 24 Nm of torque and is paired to a 6-speed transmission with slipper clutch similar to the 2017 390 Duke. \nKTM has had a reputation of creating nimble motorcycles, hence the power delivery on the 250 Duke would also be quick as we experienced in its younger and elder cousins 200 Duke and 390 Duke. \nRoyal Enfield Himalayan on the other hand has a 411cc single cylinder, air-cooled, 4 stroke, SOHC engine that produces 24.5 bhp @ 6500 rpm and 32 Nm of torque @ 4000-4500 rpm. It comes with a 5-speed constant mesh transmission. \nA smaller power figure, but a larger torque figure would mean the Himalayan is not as quick or as fast as the 250 Duke, however when shown incline, it will remain composed. \nDesign \nBased on a KTM 1290 Superduke, the 250 Duke has been designed for quick maneuverability and precision riding. The lightweight steel trellis frame and its riding stance means it can go faster on corners. The riding position on the Himalayan is more upright for comfort during prolonged riding and overall design does not encourage fast corners or leaning. However, the suspension set up and the positioning of the handlebar and the footpegs translates into easy maneuverability on difficult surfaces. 2017 KTM 250 Duke \nEquipment \nThe 250 Duke has a host of features such as an LCD instrument console similar to the 200 Duke that provides information like fuel gauge, speed, tachometer, clock, trip metre, service reminder and gear shift light. The new 250 Duke is offered with a choice of two body colours - orange and white. \nHimalayan's instrument cluster is fairly simple with an analogue speedo and rev counter. But it comes with a digital compass to assist the rider during prolonged tours. The Himalayan also has mounting points at the front and back to allow strapping of luggage or jerry cans. It is available in two body colours â€“ snow and granite. \nDuke 250 has fuel tank tank capacity of 13.4 litres and weighs about 149 kgs (dry weight), while the Himalayan weighs 189 kgs and comes with 15.5 litre fuel tank. Royal Enfield Himalayan \nBraking duties on the 250 Duke are served by a 300 mm disc at the front and a 200mm disc at the rear. It comes equipped with ABS, which can be turned off. \nThe Himalayan has disc brakes at the front (300 mm) and back (240 mm), and telescopic front suspension and monoshock with linkage rear suspension. \nThe 250 Duke comes with 17 inch cast light alloy wheels with tyres that are designed for grip, and hence the rider can lean on corners. They are 110 mm wide at the front and 150 mm at the rear. \nHimalayan comes with 21 inch spokes wheel at the front and 17 inch at the back, and are 90 mm wide in the front and 120 mm at the back. With a tourer design, the Himalayan is not a corner craving motorcycle, but it remains at peace when on bad roads. \nPrice \nKTM 250 Duke is priced at Rs 1.73 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), while the Himalayan is priced at Rs 1.56 lakh (ex-showroom). With a bigger price tag of the two, the 250 Duke offers more features like ABS and a very detailed instrument cluster. The Himalayan, on the other hand, does not get any of these fancy electronic bits. Its more of a mechanical machine, and hence it is easier to have a Royal Enfield Himalayan mended as there are more RE workshops across India than there are of KTM, which needs precision attention as there are lot of electronics involved.
