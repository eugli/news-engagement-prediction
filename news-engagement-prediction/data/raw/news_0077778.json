Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Shami Chakrabarti appeared on the TV this morning, offering a string of reasons for Labour's drubbing in the Copeland by-election.\nThe party suffered a crushing defeat to the Tories in the seat, which has been a Labour stronghold since before World War II.\nBut asked on Friday if he had looked in the mirror and thought 'Maybe I'm the problem\", Jeremy Corbyn simply said: \"No.\" \nToday, Labour Peer Baroness Chakrabarti went on the Andrew Marr show to give a postmortem on Labour's worst by-election defeat in 50 years.\nHere's all the reasons she gave for the party's historic rejection in Copeland. In order.\nRead More 9 unbelievable reasons Jeremy Corbyn allies gave for Labour losing in Copeland - and one they didn't 1. Previous Labour MPs (Photo: PA) She said: \"I think Copeland is probably one of those constituencies that was neglected by my own party over some years.\n\"It's remote from London. It's changed its shape over many years. There's the nuclear industry and people who've done very well out of that industry - and then the people left behind.\"\nThe previous MP for Copeland was Jamie Reed, a vocal critic of Jeremy Corbyn . \n2. It's a revolt against the establishment (Photo: PA) Andrew Marr questioned Jeremy Corbyn 's claim that the loss in Copeland had been a revolt against the establishment, which seems an unlikely reason for an opposition party losing to the governing party. \nBaroness Chakrabarti said: \"From my experience in Copeland, in Copeland Labour has looked like the establishment for a very long time because they've been represented by Labour for a long time.\n3. 'Apocryphal' stories about Jeremy Corbyn's stance on nuclear power Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party (Photo: REUTERS) She went on: \"There are peculiarities about that seat, like what was said about the nuclear industry that was apocryphal, and so on.\"\nShe didn't specify what she meant by that, but on Friday, Emily Thornberry said claims Jeremy Corbyn was opposed to nuclear power were \"fake news.\" \nThis is untrue \nIn his policy document for the 2015 leadership election, Corbyn wrote: \"I am opposed to fracking and to new nuclear on the basis of the dangers posed to our ecosystems. New nuclear power will mean the continued production of dangerous nuclear waste and an increased risk from radioactive accident and nuclear proliferation.\" 4. A disunited party (Photo: PA) She said: \"We've clearly suffered from disunity. Two leadership elections in the space of a year.\n\"We've clearly suffered from the fact that our supporters were divided, like the country, over Brexit .\" \n5. The media Caroline Flint (R) on last week's Andrew Marr show Asked why Labour's message has failed to cut through, Baroness Chakrabarti said: \"I think sometimes we haven't had the fairest or most balanced treatment in the media, including in the broadcast media.\"\nShe insisted she wasn't blaming the media, but that the \"disunity\" in the party was the focus of coverage.\nShe complained that in the previous episode, which aired four days before the vote, there \"wasn't a single person on your programme speaking for the [Labour] leadership.\"\nMarr pointed out Labour MP Caroline Flint was on the paper review panel for the episode.\n6. Peter Mandelson (Photo: PA) Baroness Chakrabarti complained that Lord Mandelson had been interviewed on the programme.\nShe said: \"You're allowed to have whoever you like, but it wasn't, if I may say so, the fairest balance a few days before a by-election in two Labour, Brexit seats.\" \n7. 'Constant' attacks on Jeremy Corbyn (Photo: Christopher Furlong) She said: \"Constant attacks on the leadership, constant leadership elections, constant divisions don't actually attack the issues that would allow us to present an alternative vision of what this country should be.\"\n8. The weather (Photo: Jen Stout/Liverpool Echo) Marr confronted Baroness Chakrabarti with a quote where she blamed Storm Doris for Labour's dismal showing, because Labour voters don't tend to have cars.\nShe replied: \"Well, that is one aspect of all by-elections.\"\nMarr noted that it's been an issue for hundreds of years, and in every case opposition voters have managed to come out and defeat the government.\nShe said: \"There was low turnout in Copeland. It's a very rural constituency. Public transport is not great. But it's just one factor. Of course that's not the entire explanation.\"\n9. It's 'remote' (Photo: Christopher Furlong) She said that the increased party membership helped in Stoke, because lots of new members helped out with canvassing.\nHe said: \"Copeland, a bit more remote. We had fewer people on the ground.\"\n10. It's not the policies, it's communication Rebecca Long-Bailey (Photo: Manchester Evening News) Baroness Chakrabarti had another pop at Labour's treatment by the media: \"It's about getting the space, and we're not always given the space to be heard. We've got some wonderful shadow cabinet colleagues who I rarely see get the air time they deserve.\"\nShe said it's hard for Debbie Abrahams, Angela Rayner and Rebecca Long-Bailey to get on the telly.\nShe said: \"A lot of the women, actually, because it's now a very female shadow cabinet. It'd be nice sometimes to hear those voices heard including on your programme.\"\nAt the end of the interview, Marr pointed out Rebecca Long-Bailey has been invited on the programme, but \"so far has not been able to come.\" \nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Labour Party Jeremy Corbyn Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T14:19:57.631+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
