Slot to Philadelphia Links \nThe Philadelphia Eagles are in the market for a free agent wide receiver, being linked to Alshon Jeffery , DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon among others. \nOne of the other top free agents on the market is Kenny Britt , who is coming off a career-high 68 catches for 1,002 yards to go with five touchdowns for the Los Angeles Rams in 2016. \nCould a career year from Britt drive up is market value come March 9? Surprisingly, Britt is affordable for any team that pursues him. \nAccording to Spotrac , Britt's market value is calculated at an average annual salary at $6.7 million. He's expected to land a three-year, $20.1 million deal in free agency. \nThose dollar amounts certainly could entice the Eagles to sign Britt as the franchise currently has around $12 million in available cap space (that number is expected to go up). \nThe Philadelphia Eagles have a crucial offseason ahead of them as the franchise looks to return to the playoffs for the first time since 2013.

The Eagles are expected to go on a salary cap purge in the next few weeks, which could lead to an estimated $30-to-35 million in salary cap space entering free agency. \nComparable contracts to Britt's on the free agent market include Mohamed Sanu and Michael Crabtree . \nSanu, who signed a five-year, $32.5 million deal with the Atlanta Falcons prior to last season, was coming off a 33 catch, 394-yard season with the Cincinnati Bengals in 2015 before signing his deal. He was a vital part in Atlanta's offense as a No. 2 option, catching 59 passes for 653 yards and four touchdowns for a 72.8 percent catch rate. \nCrabtree may be due for an extension after signing his four-year, $34 million deal with the Oakland Raiders. Since signing his deal in 2015, Crabtree has 174 catches for 1,925 yards and 17 touchdowns as a No. 2 option to Amari Cooper . \nObviously, Britt wouldn't be a No. 1 option on the Eagles, but his market value would give them some extra cap space to sign that No. 1 wide receiver they covet should they choose to go that route. \nAt 28, Britt's market value doesn't fall out of the Eagles price range, but gives the franchise an option should they strike out on landing Jeffery or Jackson. \nRegardless of the deal Britt gets, he'll likely exceed his value if he lands with the Eagles. Britt set his career-high in yards and touchdowns with Mike Groh (who's now with the Eagles) as his wide receivers coach. \nGroom's presence could play a huge factor in the Eagles pursuit of Britt, and Britt's decision to come to Philadelphia.
