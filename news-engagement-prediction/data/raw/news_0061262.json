On one hand, you have Shashi's (Anushka Sharma's character in the film) unfulfilled dream of getting married to Diljit Dosanjh 's character. On the other hand, Suraj Sharma 's character Kanan can be seen tying the knot with Mehreen Pirzada 's Anu. Understandably then, the film boasts of a vivacious wedding song.\n‘Phillauri’ song ‘Dum Dum’: Anushka Sharma-Diljit Dosanjh relive old school romance The Sufi love song from Anushka Sharma’s ‘Phillauri’ is out and brings back the charm of old school romance. The soothing number tells the love story of Diljit Dosanjh and Anushka Sharma, who plays village belle Shashi in the film.\nTitled 'Whats Up', the song sees how preparations for Suraj and Mehreen's wedding are on in full swing while Anushka, who plays a ghost, continues to haunt the groom. The video is simultaneously interwoven with flashbacks of Anushka's wedding when she was all set to marry Diljit.\nThe number is sung by Mika Singh and Jasleen Royal , and the lyrics are penned by Aditya Sharma. The song has been composed by Jasleen and the music has been produced by Raghav Mehta. Mika and Jasleen's vocals set the mood for a fun and enjoyable dance number to add to every wedding's playlist.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/embed/s7spLGzZP3g"], "published": "2017-02-23T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:03:15.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
