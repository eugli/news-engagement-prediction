Sarah Tew/CNET Method No. 2: Flash drive What is it? \nFlash drives (also called thumbdrives or jump drives) are tiny, highly portable drives, often no longer than a stick of gum. They come in a wide variety of designs, from simple sticks to novelty characters , and most can be attached to a keychain or lanyard. This method is very similar to the first one, but uses flash memory (a storage chip that can be erased and reused) instead. How does it work? \nA flash drive plugs into your computer through the USB port and once connected, you can copy or drag and drop files onto it. Once disconnected, those files will live on the flash drive until you remove them. Potential drawbacks? \nFlash drives can break down overtime, fail or become corrupted, rendering them useless. You won't be able to access your files if any of these things happen. It's unlikely that a newer flash drive will fail, but it can happen. What should I buy? \nFlash drives are smaller than external hard drives and thus offer less storage space. The biggest drives you can typically buy have 256GB of storage space, enough for a few thousand documents or photos, depending on file size. They are best suited for people with just a handful of files to backup and are especially great for students to backup schoolwork. \nThese drives range in price from a few dollars up to $100-plus, so pick a size and style of drive that you think will work for your storage needs and lifestyle. Cloud storage keeps your files backed up on a server away from your home or office. Nicole Cozma/CNET Method No. 3: Cloud storage What is it? \nCloud storage is system where you move your files from your computer to a server in a data center, away from your home or work. A cloud storage company uses those servers to offer a certain amount of space that you essentially rent to store your files. How does it work? \nOnce you sign up for a cloud storage service, you can upload files with a desktop application or through the company's website over the Internet. With an Internet connection, you can view, modify and delete files stored in your cloud storage account at anytime, from any computer or mobile device. You can move files back onto your computer whenever you want. Potential drawbacks? \nThough cloud storage is a great backup option, there are a few risks. Cloud storage services can be and have been hacked, most recently in 2014 when a security breach of Apple's iCloud service exposed several celebrity photos. \nAnother risk is if the cloud storage company goes out of business and shuts down operations, which happened with smaller cloud storage service Firedrive . If this happens, you won't be able to access any of the files you've stored in your account. \nOther drawbacks include files taking a long time to upload to your cloud folder, which can eat up your Internet bandwidth and slow down your connection temporarily. Additionally, without an Internet connection, you might not be able to access any files stored in your account. What should I buy? \nCloud storage is inexpensive, with many companies giving you small amounts of free storage. For a monthly fee, starting around $10, you can get extra space. Cloud storage is a great choice for anyone who wants to back up photos, since many companies have mobile apps that automatically upload photos and video you take with a phone or tablet, right after you record them. \nFor help picking a cloud storage service, check out CNET's comprehensive guide to the most popular choices. Network-attached storage devices offer an advanced kind of storage. Dong Ngo/CNET Extra credit \nThe different storage methods mentioned above are great for anyone, since they are easy to use and usually inexpensive. But if you need a more advanced option, there's the complete backup and network attached storage (NAS). \nPrograms such as CrashPlan and Carbonite continuously back up entire folders on your hard drive, instead of just a few files that you choose. Those applications can also back up your entire hard drive, if you want them to. Then there are tools that take a system image of your machine -- basically a snapshot of all of the files and settings at a particular time -- that you can use in case your computer crashes or you somehow lose a large swath of files. On Mac, the built-in Time Machine program does this, while Windows has its own system image backup tool. \nFor more robust local storage that's also available online, there's NAS. A NAS server is essentially one or more hard drives connected to your computer over an Internet connection. It's like your own personal cloud. They can be pricy and a bit complicated to set up, but for serious storage needs, they are well worth it. Read more about them in CNET's picks for the top five affordable NAS servers .
