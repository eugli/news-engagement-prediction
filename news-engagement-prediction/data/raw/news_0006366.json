Salem Partners, a Los Angeles-based investment bank and wealth management firm, plans to open its 232-unit Manaolana Place project that will include 125 hotel rooms and 107 luxury residences in partnership with Mandarin Oriental in early 2020. “Mandarian Oriental, Honolulu” will be the name of the hotel part of the… more Rendering Courtesy: Architects Hawaii “Mandarian Oriental, Honolulu” will be the name of the hotel part of the 743,000-square-foot Manaolana Place project, while the “Residences at Mandarian Oriental” will be the name of the residences of the development that’s at the corner of Kapiolani Boulevard and Atkinson Drive near Ala Moana Center. It would be the first Mandarin Oriental hotel in Hawaii since 2006, when The Kahala Hotel & Resort was rebranded as an independent property. Pacific Business News first reported about the project, which includes Colorado-based architecture firm [au]workshop, Honolulu’s AHL, formerly known as Architects Hawaii Ltd., Dianna Wong Architects + Interior Design and Hart Howerton Landscape Architects. The project will also include a rooftop restaurant and bar, a sky lobby lounge, an all-day dining restaurant, wedding and meeting spaces, outdoor terraces, and gardens, as well as a “Spa at Mandarin Oriental” that will have eight treatment rooms, a fitness center and an 80-foot outdoor swimming pool. Salem Partners plans to start construction on Manaolana Place this year. The 400-foot-high mixed-use project is located near a planned Honolulu rail transit station, thus making it a transit-oriented development project. During construction, up to 900 jobs will be created by the project. Upon completion in 2020, up to 620 net permanent jobs will be generated by Manaolana Place. It is also expected to contribute $4.4 million annually in tax and fee revenue for the city. The project is also contributing more than $7 million in community benefits including public space, bike racks, traffic improvements and affordable housing. The same developer plans to develop a parcel occupied by the Heald College Building next to Walgreens’ flagship Hawaii store in Honolulu into another high-rise condominium-hotel tower, as first reported by PBN. Mandarian Oriental Hotel Group operates nearly 30 hotels and eight residences in about 20 countries and territories. In the United States, it has hotels and residences in Atlanta, Boston, Las Vegas, Miami, New York and Washington D.C. The brand has gained quite a following by celebrities, including Kevin Spacey, Morgan Freeman, Lucy Liu and Geoffrey Rush, who Mandarian Oriental calls its “fans.” Duane Shimogawa covers energy, commercial real estate and development for Pacific Business News.
