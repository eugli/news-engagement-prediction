At one point, when DeVos tried to enter the school door, two protesters blocked her path, forcing her to return to her car.\n\"Go back! Shame, shame\": Protesters block Education Secretary Betsy DeVos from entering a public school in DC https://t.co/WGpkMsi8uC pic.twitter.com/FL2X6G8Pny\n— CNN (@CNN) February 10, 2017\nDeVos eventually made it inside the school, in a visit that was designed to help her mend fences with teachers and parents across the country.\nThe visit itself was closed to the news media, and the Education Department had no immediate comment about the protest.\nDeVos, 59, is a billionaire Republican donor who spent more than two decades promoting charter schools and school voucher programs in her home state of Michigan and other states. She faced fierce opposition during the confirmation process from teachers unions who fear that she intends to defund traditional public schools. Two Republican senators from rural states that rely heavily on public schools opposed the nomination and Vice President Mike Pence had to cast a tie-breaking vote on Tuesday.\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the groups that vigorously opposed DeVos’ nomination, condemned the incident.\n“Just heard a protester blocked & almost knocked Secy @BetsyDeVos down at Jefferson,” she wrote on Twitter. “We don’t condone such acts.”\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser also stressed on Twitter that protests should be peaceful. “We welcome Betsy DeVos & anyone who wants to learn more about our schools,” she wrote.\nDeVos’ visit to the school was not announced by the Education Department.\nJennifer Ibrahim, 34, a humanitarian worker, brought her toddler son in a stroller to the protest.\n“I want to support our local public schools, make sure that everybody gets fair treatment under the system and I don’t feel like that’s where we are headed with our new education person,” Ibrahim said. “Charter schools aren’t necessarily better than public schools.”\nAri Schwartz, 26, a non-profit worker, held a poster in which a picture of a teddy bear was juxtaposed with a photo of Devos. “This is a bear. This is a threat to students,” the caption read.\nDuring her confirmation hearings, DeVos suggested that schools should have guns on campus to protect students against grizzly bears.\nPublic schools are “the foundation of our society, that’s how everybody learns what’s right and wrong,” Schwartz said. “We need to keep it that way.”\nElizabeth Davis, president of the Washington Teachers Union said teachers will continue to fight for good public education and hope DeVos will listen to them.\n“We want quality public schools … for all of our children in every zip code in DC,” Davis told the Associated Press ahead of the protest. “We do not want to continue a trend of starving, punishing and closing our public schools to make way for privatization and more charter schools and vouchers.”\nBut former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who served under President Barack Obama, tweeted, “Agree or disagree w @Betsy DeVos on any issue, but let’s all agree she really needs to be in public schools. Please let her in.”\n___\nThis version corrects the spelling of Randi Weingarten’s name.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/WGpkMsi8uC", "https://t.co/FL2X6G8Pny", "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/830106186070556675"], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:07:15.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
