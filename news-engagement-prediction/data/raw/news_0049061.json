Austria’s justice ministry may now have to decide between the US and Spanish requests. \nThe developments are a dramatic setback for a mogul whose business and political relationships stretch from the top echelons of Russia and Ukraine to close associates of US President Donald Trump. \nLocal media reported that Mr Firtash reacted with “silent horror” as the Vienna court, packed with the tycoon’s relatives, business associates and journalists, read out its ruling. \nThe billionaire gas trader has been exiled in Austria since early 2014, where his lawyers have contested the US request to extradite him over alleged bribery involving titanium dealings in India. \nAustrian authorities detained him in March 2014, days after his political patron, the Russian-leaning Viktor Yanukovich, was ousted as Ukraine’s president by street protests in Kiev’s “Maidan” revolution. \nHe has remained in Austria ever since, after paying a record €125m bail, reportedly helped by a loan provided by a Russian businessman close to the inner circle of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. \nSpanish media, meanwhile, reported last year that local authorities had issued an extradition request for Mr Firtash, alleging that he served as leader of a money laundering ring in Catalonia. With two other businessmen whose identities have yet to be made public, he is suspected of laundering €10m through property deals and the restaurant business, reportedly originating from companies based in Cyprus and the Virgin Islands. \nSpain’s public prosecution service was not available for comment. \nRubbing shoulders with political and business elite of Russia and Ukraine, Mr Firtash had earlier established himself as the dominant figure in Ukraine’s gas business, with interests also spanning chemicals, titanium, banking and media. \nAccording to court documents and reports, Mr Firtash a decade ago pursued property dealings in the US with Paul Manafort, the US political consultant who was briefly head of President Trump’s election campaign last year. \nMr Manafort stepped down from his Trump campaign role amid mounting questions over his business and political ties in Ukraine and Russia. He had previously advised Mr Yanukovich, helping the two-time prime minister get elected as Ukraine’s president in 2010. \nMr Firtash has steadfastly denied wrongdoing and claimed that the US, which backed Kiev’s pro-western, post-revolution leadership, was pursuing a politically-motivated case against him. \nOn Tuesday the Vienna court reversed a lower Austrian court ruling from last year that turned down the extradition request. \n“This does not mean that somebody is being pre-judged as guilty, but rather that it will be decided in another country whether they are guilty or innocent,” Reuters quoted the judge as saying, after granting an appeal against the lower court decision. \n“This is serious,” a shocked associate of Mr Firtash told the Financial Times after the ruling, which his supporters had expected to go in the Ukrainian businessman’s favour. The associate added that extradition to the US now appeared a formality. \nAustria’s justice ministry must make a final decision on whether to extradite Mr Firtash, but can “take into account the interests and legal obligations of the Austrian Republic”. \nEven if it turns down the US request, however, Vienna may be obliged to deport Mr Firtash to Spain under Madrid’s European warrant. \nMr Firtash’s business empire in Ukraine has dwindled as the post-revolutionary government has tightened up on gas market dealings. Some of his chemical plants in east Ukraine have also been shut down by the three-year war between government forces and Russian-backed separatists. \nAny return to Ukraine could also carry risks for the tycoon, after authorities there shut down his bank and claimed his past dealings as a partner of Russia on the local gas market were being investigated and could warrant arrest. \nAdditional reporting by Ralph Atkins in Zurich, Tobias Buck in Madrid and Neil Buckley in London Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.
