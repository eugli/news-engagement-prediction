Karen Bradley said the government wants to protect the 'crown jewels' of sports Credit: PA \nMs Bradley said: \"We want to future-proof these regulations so that in an ever-changing digital landscape the public will still have access to the crown jewels of sport on free-to-air channels.\" \nWhat live sporting events are free-to-air?
