Liberal campaign pledges: Live export facility at Kwinana at a cost of $110m, funded from part sale of Western Power $15,000 stamp duty concessions for over-65s who want to downsize or change homes capped at $750,000 house value $5,000 bonus to employers who take on apprentices, aiming to boost apprenticeships by 15,000 Labor campaign pledges: Tafe fees to be frozen Money from Roe 8 to be directed to Metronet, road funding New tax on foreign property buyers \nPremier Colin Barnett exhorted Liberal supporters to be \"brave and bold\" as the his government pushes towards polling day, campaigning for a third term. \n\"We've got three weeks ahead of us. It's going to be fought out, on the ground, seat by seat. But we're in this,\" he told hundreds of blue-shirt-wearing supporters who packed the Octagon Theatre at UWA. \nMr Barnett, who arrived onstage to the sounds of Daft Punk's One More Time, used the campaign launch to outline three new election pledges. \nHe contrasted his government's plan for economic growth and reducing debt through privatisation of Western Power, with Labor's strategy of siphoning off royalties. \nMr Barnett said Labor's strategy was flawed and would fail. \n\"Labor have no plan. They have absolutely no plan. So not only can they not deliver what they are promising, they cannot guide this state economy through this new phase,\" he said. Perth transformed from Dullsville to 'pumping' \nMr Barnett used the speech to linger on familiar themes, of how his government had transformed Perth from \"Dullsville\" into a vibrant city, through major projects like Elizabeth Quay and major events like international arts festival The Giants. \nHe recounted a walk through the city last night, where he was struck by the activity and crowds from the river to Northbridge. \n\"Not my normal language, but Perth was pumping,\" he said. \n\"I guess I always knew the physical changes could happen. What I didn't anticipate was the change in the vibrancy of our city,\" he said. Premier 'comfortable' with campaign getting personal \nPrior to the Premier taking to the stage, the rhetoric was much more pointed, with former state treasurer turned Federal Minister Christian Porter levelling a series of personal, scathing observations about Labor leader Mark McGowan. \nAfter showing a picture of Mr McGowan perspiring in a press conference, Mr Porter told the crowd: \"On Starship WA, we need the real McCoy, not a slimy, sweaty McGowan.\" \nSpeaking after the launch, Mr Barnett said he was untroubled by the personal references. \n\"They weren't my words but I am comfortable with that,\" he said. \n\"Indeed, given the abuse I've copped from Mark McGowan over the years, this is an election campaign, it's all on the table.\" Labor vows WA 'won't be bullied' Photo: Labor leader Mark McGowan has pledged to freeze tafe fees and tax foreign property buyers. (ABC News: Robert Koenig-Luck) \nMeanwhile, WA's Opposition Leader, Mr McGowan, said he would not be bullied by the Federal Government on infrastructure funding and vowed to freeze TAFE fees, in an address to the Labor Party's campaign launch. \nMr McGowan described Labor as experienced and ready to govern, in an address to a few hundred party faithful just under three weeks from the state election. \nHe took to the stage to ACDC's TNT and received what one Labor figure described as a \"rockstar reception\", before urging the public to vote for change on March 11.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T13:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:30:13.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
