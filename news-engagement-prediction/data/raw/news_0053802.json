(CBC)\nDoucet did not speak to how the money will be used specifically and said more announcements will follow.\nHe stressed a need for more consumer education about buying local and said the government wants to make local goods more recognizable through labelling and marketing.\nBut the shift to buying local has to come from consumers, Doucet said, since the government cannot force a retailer to sell locally produced food.\n\"And when they start to drive this, what is going to happen is retail is going to follow soon,\" he said, adding that New Brunswickers spend about $2.6 billion on food each year.\n\"Much of it is produced elsewhere in the world so just imagine, just imagine the possibilities if we could produce even half of that food right here in New Brunswick.\"\nDoubling of efforts Frazer-Chiasson said consumer education is a big piece in making people buy local, as is promoting New Brunswick-made food and beverages and creating pride in the products.\nRébeka Frazer-Chiasson says consumer education should be a big piece of buy local efforts. (greenpartynb.ca)\nBut some of the work, including labelling, has already been done by other groups and organizations in the province.\nRather than potentially doubling efforts, she suggested the government consult these groups about what role it could take in promoting New Brunswick products and helping farmers and where it may be better equipped to help.\n\"I think we need to have a conversation about who should be doing what at this point,\" she said, adding that more information on the use of the $415,000 would help.\n\"We'd really just like to know what it is and how is the government stepping in and working with what's already been done and pushing it one step over.\"\nOne potential initiative, which Doucet supported during his announcement Tuesday, would be to bring more local produce to school and hospital cafeterias.\nFrazer-Chiasson said the government itself should serve more local food at its luncheons and meetings.\n\"That's where we should be promoting and eating and celebrating what we can grow in New Brunswick,\" she said.\nTransportation costs Andrew Lovell, an apple farmer and director with the Agricultural Alliance of New Brunswick, who was present during Tuesday's budget announcement, said local producers will benefit from the provincial initiative.\nApple farmer Andrew Lovell says local producers will benefit from the province's buy local initiative. (CBC)\nHe said the biggest barriers for farmers to get their food sold right now remain transportation costs and access to larger markets.\n2 companies step in to fill gap left by Real Food Connections closure Selling their products closer to home would cut down on those costs and reinvest in the farming sector in New Brunswick.\nRight now, starting a new farm or business is too costly for a lot of people, he said. One acre on an apple farm, for example, now costs $25,000 to plant.\n\"That's a lot of money to come up for someone who is not currently in the business,\" Lovell said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:34:49.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
