(Photo: Jim Maguire) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSAN FRANCISCO — Declarations by close to 250 women and men describe the nation's largest jewelry company, which operates under the name of Kay Jewelers, Jared the Galleria of Jewelry and Zales, as a hotbed or sexual harassment where senior men treated young saleswomen as their private harems, groping, demeaning and demanding sex in return for better jobs and job security, the Washington Post reported Monday. \nThe declarations are part of a private class-action arbitration case first filed in 2008 that alleges female employees at the conglomerate were routinely sexually harassed, paid less and passed over for promotion. \nSterling, which has its headquarters near Akron, Ohio, operates close to 1,500 stores in the United States. \nChief executives of Sterling's parent company Signet Jewelers, including CEO Mark Light, are among those accused of demanding sexual favors, according to documents filed in the case. \nThe Post has been seeking access to the sworn statements for several years but it wasn't until Sunday night that the more than 1,300 pages of statements were released to the newspaper. \nThe class-action case includes 69,000 current and former females employees of Sterling. \nThe statements describe top male managers at the company sending \"scouting\" parties to stores to find female staffers to target for sex. \nThe managers so frequently demanded sex from female workers in exchange for better positions within the company that there was an internal phrase for it — \"going to the big stage,\" the Post reported. \nSterling disputed the allegations. \n\"We have thoroughly investigated the allegations and have concluded they are not substantiated by the facts and certainly do not reflect our culture,\" David Bouffard, vice president for Signet Corporate Affairs, said in a statement to USA TODAY. \nMany of the allegations go back decades and \"involve a very small number of individuals in a workforce of more than 84,000 during the class period,\" he said. \nJared, The Galleria of Jewelery - Jared is the number 1 off-mall destination retail jeweler (Photo: Newscast Online) Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2mykReb NEVER MISS OUT Managing Your Money Master your money with the latest business and investment news, articles and tips from financial experts each Friday.
