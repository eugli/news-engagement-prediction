Share on Twitter Print This Post \nSo far at CPAC we have seen nonstop attacks on “globalists” and “globalism”– and this from a president who makes money from all over the globe. On the whole, this makes as much sense as liberals being cast as the elites when it’s Trump who uses a golden toilet as his throne. \nBut hey, we’ll give this sort of thinking its due consideration and file it appropriately. \nPerhaps seeing as how he can’t round folks up and march them into death camps yet – though getting rid of our health insurance is a good start to the old Republican healthcare plan of “hurry up and die”– Alex Jones, that noted purveyor of “Trumpypoo”™ – the material Trump ingests before he regurgitates it on Twitter, wants all you globalists to just kill yourselves. \nIn what has come to be one of his classic video horror stories, Jones posted a video to his Facebook page titled “Alex Jones Emergency SOS To Donald Trump.” \nIn this video he not so cordially invites globalists to end the misery of having to listen to him: \n“All across the world, humanity knows you’re the enemy. We’re going to get you a$$holes, just know that. It doesn’t mean we’re perfect but we’re not out to screw women and children and hurt people. You understand that, a$$holes? You hate humanity because you project your own hatred of yourself on us, a$$holes. You want to kill us, how about you die? Kill your fucking selves you fucking globalists!” \nHe’s not clear how he’s going to “get us”– whether those death camps are coming or not, or if he just means by doing what Bannon calls “deconstructing the administrative state.” You know, which means no goods and services, no safe air, water or food – and no healthcare when our air, water and food poison us. \nSo much anger for a guy who says other people hate. We can file that too. It’s funny, however, to hear Jones accuse “globalists” of “screwing” women when his hero Trump is the guy who brags about doing just that, even claiming it was “his” Vietnam. \nJones, as PFAW’s Brian Tashman notes , may be as famous at the White House as he claims, saying the other day that “Politico reported that the president’s aides used ‘alternative media like Breitbart, Washington Examiner, Fox News, Infowars and the Daily Caller to show Trump positive coverage.’” \nIt would be funny if this sort of lunacy wasn’t exactly what is inspiring Trump’s tweets and his bizarre speeches, including that at CPAC today. A worldview so twisted both horrifies and fascinates, if only because there is exactly 0 evidence in support of it. \nIt is almost as if the more reason intrudes, the more strongly the deluded like Jones and Trump respond by blaming the world for not being stupid enough to believe their every ranting claim. We cannot cure their disease but we can point and laugh. \nIt won’t stop them from being what they are, but it laughter is good for us, and therefore has the added benefit of not only making them angry, but keeping us alive longer to torment them. Most of us would call that a win-win.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:49:39.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
