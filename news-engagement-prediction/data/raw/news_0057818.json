I felt awful and ashamed. I wanted to breastfeed because it’s so good for the baby , so I worked with a lactation specialist,” Sims said in 2015 . \n“After three months, she said, ‘You’re done. You don’t have any milk.’ I’ll try breastfeeding again, but if it doesn’t work, I won’t push it.” A post shared by Molly Sims (@mollybsims) on Feb 14, 2017 at 1:04pm PST A post shared by Molly Sims (@mollybsims) on Feb 2, 2017 at 10:54pm PST \nAnother obstacle aside from low milk supply?
