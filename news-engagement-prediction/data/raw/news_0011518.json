Big B in his blog revealed that he did not take any money for working in the project as working with the director in such an epic script was ‘sufficient fees’ for him. “I had just wanted to work with Sanjay, after seeing all other works he had done. And when the opportunity came, it was quite overwhelming. I did not take any salary for the film. Just being a part of such an enterprise, was sufficient fees,” Amitabh posted on his blog. \nThe 74-year-old veteran actor further recalled an incident when fire damaged the set of the film during its production. Amitabh said that he along with actress Rani Mukherjee, who played the role of a blind, deaf girl in the movie, visited Bhansali’s house and got ready to do all the scenes again. “He (Bhansali) built the first set of the house at a new floor at Film City, the first set to be put up at this floor. I was shooting for ‘Kaun Banega Crorepati’ in Film City and Bhansali invited me to come over and see the set,” he added. T 2523 – 12 YEARS OF “BLACK” ..!! An amazing film an amazing experience ..!! An amazing director Sanjay Leela Bhansali !! pic.twitter.com/PbCQ9WOYCx \n— Amitabh Bachchan (@SrBachchan) February 3, 2017 \n“It was magnificent! And just before I entered, Bhansali had lit up the place with candles. It looked heavenly,” said Big B. Amitabh, in his post, went on to add that when they were “half way through the schedule”, one morning they got to know about the “tragedy — a fire on set, and the entire set burnt down”. \n“Rani and I sped across to Sanjay’s home to hold his hand that morning to reassure him that we would re-shoot what had been lost, again. He was quite obviously distraught and broken, but never too much to not get back up on his feet. He did. We did. And the results are there to be seen,” Amitabh added. \n“It was special from the very first day of its shooting. Bhansali came to Nasik where I was shooting for Khakee to narrate the script to me, stated reading from a very well bound black file, read a few sentences, and then stopped. ‘I am a bad narrator Amitji, you read the script…’ and left for Mumbai,” Amitabh said. \nFurther lauding Bhansali’s skills and magic he creates while directing, Amitabh said, “Sanjay’s attention to detail, his creating an ambiance to enhance performances, was simply breathtaking” \nYou might also want to see this: \n“At the premiere when we all saw the film, there was just those tears of joy within me, and of course the fact of having Dilip saheb (Dilip Kumar) in the audience was a childhood dream coming true,” Amitabh said. \n“When the film got over, he stood outside the hall, held my hands and just looked into my eyes. It was, what I could have allowed, to last for a lifetime,” he added. Black, which released on February 4, 2005, is a story of a blind, deaf girl (played by Rani Mukerji), and her relationship with her teacher (Amitabh) who himself later develops Alzheimer’s disease. \nWith inputs from IANS…", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T23:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T13:48:13.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
