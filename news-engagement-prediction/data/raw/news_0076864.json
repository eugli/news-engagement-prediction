'But do I want to settle down with a 25-year-old? Not really.'\n'Do I want to wake up in two years with them leaving because they're not ready to commit? Guys will tell you anything they want to get what they want.'\nUpset: But Anthony has complained that there have been problems with 'intimacy' between the couple\n'That's your error': During a dinner party, the 33-year-old told Nadia problems with her ex boyfriends were her fault\nAnthony first blamed Nadia for her relationship problems, then got annoyed about the subject altogether.\n'You went for the wrong blokes, that's your error,' he said. '[But] we don't need to talk about that because you're married to me, I don't need to know your history.'\nHe then once again mentioned the 'intimacy' problems he said the couple were having.\n'I don't need to hear that stuff': He told his wife that he didn't want to know about her 'history'\n'You've been frigid': During a preview for Sunday night's episode, Anthony called Nadia frigid\n'I don't really need to hear that stuff,' he told the camera. 'In terms of romance and intimacy with Nadia, she's not comfortable with certain things. But from the sounds of it, she's had guys in the past and she had no issues with them.'\nTensions appear to boil over during Sunday night's episode, with a preview showing Anthony confronting Nadia over the issue.\n'For lack of a better word, you've been frigid,' he tells his wife during the commitment ceremony.\nWhat her reaction will be, only time will tell.\nMarried At First Sight returns 7:00pm Sunday on Channel Nine.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-28T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:54:56.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
