The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter late Wednesday after the report was published. \nMr. Trump also reportedly had a heated conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. \nMr. Pena Nieto’s scheduled trip to the White House was cancelled once the Mexican president reaffirmed that his country would not pay for a wall along the United States’ southern border. \n“Anybody who just discovered that President Donald J. Trump is a resolute, decisive man who doesn’t mince his words and who’s putting America and her allies and her people and her interests first is waking up, I think, out of a cave for the last two years,” Ms. Conway said. \n“But at the same time, he has had very respectful conversations with many leaders just in the last week or so, 10 or more world leaders,” she said. “He is trying to reach out to them … but he also makes very clear what his position is on any number of issues around the globe.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T15:00:04.542+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
