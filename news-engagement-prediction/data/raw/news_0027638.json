There was no immediate comment from the KRG. \n(The story was refiled to add dropped word \"liquids\" in second paragraph) \n(Reporting by Hadeel Al Sayegh; Editing by Andrew Torchia) Next In Commodities ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:13:58.518+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
