Contrary to some, Doug is happily reliant on AI and seeks out all the pleasures technology has to offer. \nBased on an original idea from Silicon Valley 's Sonny Lee, he will pen the script for the comedy and exec produce alongside Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg via their Point Grey banner. Because of its similar tone to Rogen and Goldberg's feature This Is The End, Lee reached out to the duo to come on board to produce via their Point Grey banner. \nShould Singularity go to series, it would mark Rogen and Goldberg's latest project following AMC comic book drama Preacher as well as Hulu series Future Man . \nWayans Jr., the role marks his latest TV role following his breakout gig in ABC's critical favorite Happy Endings . The always-in-demand actor counts New Girl and episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine among his credits. He previously was set to star in a Fox comedy called Henchman — exec produced by New Girl 's Jake Johnson — but the project did not move forward. On the feature side, his credits include How to be Single, Big Hero 6 and Let's Be Cops. He's repped by WME and Rise Management.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:56:31.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
