But, with the premier rejecting Toronto’s road tolls last week, she is hopeful that the motion will gain some more attention.”\n“I thought, why not have a city of Toronto lottery,” she said. “There’s billions of dollars in revenue that the province collects in lotteries throughout Canada and Ontario.”\n“If we had a city of Toronto lottery people that buy daily lottery tickets, if they knew that to buy a $1 lottery ticket that proceeds would go towards daycare, transit and housing, I think people would welcome the idea.”\nNunziata said she is aware that there are other options to generate money for the city but feels this is the best one.\nTory told CTV News Toronto that he would love to see a Toronto lottery but he’s not holding his breath on it.\n“I think it might be kind of fun to have one,” he said. “I think there would be people in Toronto who would step up and buy the tickets because they would know it was going to save transit or something like that in Toronto. But, I’m not holding my breath expecting there will be tickets on sale in the next week or so.”\nDespite the fact that city council has been exploring this motion recently, Ontario’s minister of finance Charles Sousa said they have not received any proposal regarding the matter.\nSousa told CTV News Toronto that the current lottery system adequately directs funds to the city of Toronto, but the province is open to considering other options.\n“We’re always considering options and we recognize that Toronto and other municipalities across Ontario are looking for ways to provide greater sustainability,” he said.\nPhotos Mayor John Tory says he is hopeful for a Toronto lottery but is not holding his breath. \nCity Councillor Frances Nunziata says she proposed the idea for a Toronto lottery several years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:19:24.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
