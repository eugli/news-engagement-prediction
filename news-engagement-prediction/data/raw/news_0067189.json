They became the first team to finish unbeaten in Metro play since 2010, when a Southridge team that went on to win the Class 6A state title went 14-0 in the then-smaller Metro. \n“I think it’s pretty great,” senior Kaelin Immel said. “It’s a reflection on what we’ve been working on this whole year. It was one of our goals at the beginning of the season, we wanted to win Metro, not necessarily undefeated, but we made sure we continued to work hard in practice so we could achieve that goal.” \nThe game turned into a showcase for two players whose addition to an already strong roster vaulted the Skyhawks into the top of the coaches and media polls all season. Cameron Brink, a 6-foot-4 freshman, scored 25 points, with all her 11 field goals coming around the basket, where she overwhelmed the much smaller Jaguars. \n“She’s phenomenal,” Immel said of Brink. “She’s really a special player. I don’t think they’ll ever see a girl like this again. She’s long, she’s 6-4, but not only that, she works so hard. You don’t see a lot of tall girls who can run like her, that are athletic but also work as hard as they can. And she’s really got a big heart, and she wants to win, which is huge for a team.” \nMaggie Freeman, a junior who transferred from North Medford, added 19 points, including three 3-pointers. \nSouthridge accomplished the unbeaten league record even though its returning all-league players missed games. Immel sat out three games with an ankle sprain, and junior post Nathalie Hoff had to sit out two games because of a concussion. \nBut Southridge kept right on winning, with 14 of the league wins coming by 18 points or more. \n“What it shows is we didn’t have a night where we completely didn’t show up, which is not easy to do for that long a season,” Bergmann said. “It was a good accomplishment.” \nEven with a season-long run at No. 1, there remains an air of unknown about Southridge. Of the starters, only Hoff and Immel were with the team last season, when it lost to Canby at home in the second round of the playoffs, losing out on a trip to the state tournament at the Chiles Center. Hoff played at the tournament as a freshman in 2015, but that season Immel played on a Glencoe team that lost in the second round at South Medford. This will be her final chance to cross that threshold before she graduates and goes off to play for Air Force. \n“It’s something I want, it’s something our whole team wants,” Immel said. \nThe playoff pressure will be new to Brink and starting guard McKelle Meek, who also is a freshman, and while Freeman played in playoff games with North Medford, those teams did not reach the Chiles Center. \n“It’ll be interesting how our freshmen and Maggie come in during the playoffs and see how we all come together,” Immel said. “It’s kind of a new team, we’ve had this whole season together, but going through the biggest games of the season now.” \nCentury (8-16, 3-13) saw its season come to an end with senior CJ Buckley hitting three 3-pointers and scoring 17 points, and senior Megan Still adding 16 points. \n-- Mike Tokito", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:43:37.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
