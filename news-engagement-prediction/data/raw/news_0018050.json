'Let's be honest, I can't stand Muslims,' Pickering told the gathering, according to a report in The Sydney Morning Herald . 'If they are in the same street as me, I start shaking.' Pickering, who also donated one of his cartoons featuring the rape of a woman in a niqab by her son-in-law as an auction item, wryly added he didn't think all Muslims were bad. Cartoonist Larry Pickering told a Q Society fundraiser he starts 'shaking' when he sees a Muslim in the street 'They are not all bad, they do chuck pillow-biters off buildings,' he said. The Q society, which aims 'To inform Australians about Islam', was raising funds for their legal defence bill in response to being sued for defamation by Mohamed El-Mouelhy, a Halal certifier. According to the Q Society, 'This is a landmark case with considerable ramifications for freedom of expression in Australia'. About 160 people turned out for the event at the North Ryde RSL, which was emceed by former singer Angry Anderson and included Australian Liberty Alliance senate candidate Kirralie Smith. Pickering's first cartoon was auctioned for $600 while another of his works, with an imam as a pig on a spit with a Halal certified stamp, was auctioned for an undisclosed sum.
