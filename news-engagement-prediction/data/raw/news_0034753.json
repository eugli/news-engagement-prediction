Now scrub that image from your mind and throw it in the fire cause the Olympian is all grown up and...wow. \nSports Illustrated Swimsuit appears to have a crush on the six-time gold medal winning gymnast, showcasing her for the second time since the New Year — and we can't blame them. Raisman's January Sports Illustrated video was with fellow gymnast Simone Biles, but this time she's all on her own. \nTake a peak and try and stay on your chair without falling off the side. Then, go to take a cold shower. If you're not near a shower, run home. \nThe behind-the-scenes footage showcases Aly's rockin' bod, bulging muscles and...side boob (lots of side boob) with the tagline \"Strong is Really Beautiful.\" Indeed, Aly is a specimen of elite fitness with a set of abs you could easily wash clothes on. \nAnd if you still feel weird about watching her because you recall 2012, don't. She's 22-years-old and very much a woman (who could very much kick your ass). \nWant more? Check out these topless pics of Aly, which are also from the SI shoot. Drop This Fact \nRaisman is the first ever American gymnast to win an Olympic medal in the floor exercise competition twice in a row.
