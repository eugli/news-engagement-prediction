While HP’s Stream devices are a decent stab at the same effort, the Miix 320 includes various features that help it feel a little special, even if it’s still a pretty bare-bones machine. Announced Monday at Mobile World Congress, the laptop will ship in April, with a pen-enabled version coming in July. \nThe Miix 320’s best feature is its form factor: a 2-in-1 detachable laptop, which doesn’t exist among Chromebooks (the ones with 360-degree hinges don’t count). There’s a secure, but easily released magnetic joint between the display and keyboard halves, and the 10.1-inch display is light enough to hold easily as a tablet. The screen is a little smaller than the typical Chromebook’s 11-inch display, but its 1920x1200 resolution is noticeably finer than the crummy old 1366x768 spec you find on most of those larger screens.\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:06:33.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
