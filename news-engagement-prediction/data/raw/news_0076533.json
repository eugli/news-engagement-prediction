Scientists are not sure exactly why exercise is so beneficial, but said that there are a number of factors. 'Physical activity is known to alter hormone metabolism, reduce oxidative stress, improve immune function, decrease inflammation, regulate insulin levels, and enhance lipid metabolism, all of which have an underlying role associated with cancer development and other comorbidities,' the Cancer Council explained. Green thumb: Even low impact exercise like gardening or walking can help decrease the risk of breast cancer As well as this, there are a number of cancers which are more likely to occur in overweight or obese people, so weight loss associated with exercise is also preventative. 'In our study, we found that obese women were twice as likely to be diagnosed with uterine cancer as women at a healthy weight,' Dr Nair-Shalliker said. 'We know that one in three cancer cases can be prevented â€“ obesity and physical activity play a big role in this. For example, being overweight or obese is the cause for nearly 4,000 cancer cases in Australia each year.'
