That thing there is a bidet , people! Perhaps you’ve seen real estate listings boasting “luxury master bath with bidet.” So what exactly is a bidet?\nSimply put, a bidet is a bathroom fixture designed to clean your nether regions after you use the toilet. You sit, you turn on the faucet, and a stream of water does what you would otherwise take care of with toilet paper. Got it?\nBidets are extremely popular throughout much of Europe, but they’re still a rarity in the U.S. There are a number of theories on why the bidet never took off here. One is that during the great indoor plumbing revolution, bidets happened to be associated with French prostitutes. Another is that Americans are too prudish and/or practical to spend money on two bowel-related fixtures, particularly if space in the bathroom is tight. And then there’s also simply habit. We’ve always done it this way, so why change?\nNonetheless, bidets are slowly steaming into luxury markets. Acolytes say using bidets is more hygienic than using toilet paper, easier on the earth, and easier on your plumbing. No more toilet paper to clog up the drain! (Or less of it, certainly.)\nMore From Realtor.com What Is a Half Bath?
