He added that China supported India and other countries over the matter of terrorism. He further said that the issue of NSG was an important one but bilateral cooperation was more important. \nEarlier, Informing that China’s position on the ban remained constant irrespective of India’s application last year, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Geng Shuang had said that China upheld the principles of objectivity, impartiality and professionalism and was prepared to take part in relevant discussions. \nAlso watch: \nHe had added that China’s only criteria were that it needed solid evidence against Azhar. If there is solid evidence the application can be approved. If there is no solid evidence there is hardly a consensus,” he said. He stated that China had reiterated its stand on the matter several times. Speaking of the 1267 committee he said that applications have been made by relevant countries with the committee. He added that the concerned members of the committee are in consultation but they haven’t yet reached a consensus. \nLast year, China had twice put a technical hold on India’s application to ban Masood Azhar. The United States of America has moved to the United Nations in 2017 to designate Azhar as a terrorist. It has to be remembered that Azhar was the mastermind of last year’s terror attack in Pathankot. Speaking of the NSG, China was the only country, who with his veto powers, which stood against India’s inclusion in the council at the United Nations.
