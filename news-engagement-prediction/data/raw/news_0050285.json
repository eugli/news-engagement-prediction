The idea was to promote the first edition of the Laver Cup, the team tennis competition between Europe and an International squad that will be staged in Prague in September and in which Federer wants to play a major role after helping to create the event. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story On Tuesday, he was to fly to Dubai to prepare for his return to tour competition at next week’s Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championship, a tournament he has won seven times. After that, he has the hardcourt events in Indian Wells, Calif., and Miami on his schedule in March, but only if his 35-year-old body cooperates. Federer said the upper leg injury that troubled him throughout much of the Australian Open — requiring treatment on and off the court — remains a concern. “I’m still not back in practice at 100 percent,” he said, adding, “I have to be careful.” Photo Federer exchanged half-earnest shots with Tomas Berdych on the deck of a boat on the Vltava River in Prague to promote the first edition of the Laver Cup. Credit Clive Brunskill/Getty Images for the Laver Cup That has been the rare downbeat note in his particularly upbeat month as he has celebrated his first major singles title in nearly five years. “This one definitely has had maybe the longest effect of any of the Grand Slam wins in my career,” he said. “I’m so happy because I didn’t have to play in the following weeks. It’s really allowed me to reflect and enjoy. In the past in 2003, when I won Wimbledon for the first time, I was in Gstaad the next day practicing and stuff. It’s very different this time. I’m still riding the wave, still feeling like I’m on cloud nine.” He gained some more altitude last week during his vacation in Switzerland, taking a day trip high into the mountains near his holiday home in Lenzerheide with his replica copy of the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup, the trophy awarded to the Australian Open men’s singles champion. “I call it Norman,” he said of the trophy. “I’ve had dinner with Norman, spent a lot of time with Norman. I know it’s just a replica, but that’s all right.” In 2003, when the Swiss billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli won the America’s Cup sailing competition for Switzerland (while using a crew full of hired New Zealanders in New Zealand), Bertarelli vowed to celebrate by taking the America’s Cup to the top of the Matterhorn. “That’s where I got my idea to take Norman into the mountains,” Federer said. “I don’t know if Ernesto ever did it, but I thought it was such a cool idea. To come from a faraway place like New Zealand or Australia and bring the trophy all the way back to the most important part of your homeland.” Always wanted to take the to the top of a pic.twitter.com/lxXABH7Rdq — Roger Federer (@rogerfederer) Feb. 18, 2017 There would be no Matterhorn visit in this case, but Federer did take a series of ski lifts and one snowmobile ride to a mountaintop chalet where he and his wife, Mirka, and their friends had fondue and Federer sneaked outside into the snow with Norman for a series of Alpine group photos ( Federer and Norman being the group ). \nAdvertisement “We tried a few different things up there, with the racket and a ball and Norman,” Federer said, laughing. “I just thought it was super fun. I know it was super cheesy, but the fans just love it.” Sign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.
