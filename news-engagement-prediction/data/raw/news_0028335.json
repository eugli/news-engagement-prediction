Not in a bar, nor a blind date or a dating app. Less than a year after she jumped in the back of a cab at Melbourne’s Southern Cross station, she married the driver. \nShe and Kunal now have a three-year-old son. But they won’t be celebrating Valentine’s Day with a glass of Champagne as their second child is due in just a few days’ time. \nIt took just three trips for the pair to become smitten with one another. \nIt was September 2012 when the couple unexpectedly met. But if Michelle’s travel plans had worked out as expected, she would never have met her future husband. \n“I was coming back for the weekend from the mountains and I was trying to be the first person off the bus so I could be the first person in the taxi to go home. But this girl beat me to it and so I headed to the next taxi and Kunal hopped out,” she tells news.com.au. \n“I remember looking at him thinking he was nice looking,” she admits. “That girl might have beat me off the bus but it meant we could meet.” \nKunal, who works for Melbourne taxi company 13 CABS, remembers his passenger that night was in a major rush. Kunal is a cab driver in Melbourne.

Nevertheless, Kunal — who has a background in IT — says he can remember every detail including the small talk the pair made. For her part, Michelle, who is a software implementation manager, was just impressed the cab was clean and the driver didn’t need to be directed to her destination. \nSo much so, that with several work trips coming up, she wanted a reliable cabbie to get her to and from the airport. So she grabbed his number. \nWas it just a ploy to get her cute cabbie’s details? \nNot at all, she insists. “It was purely for work, he had good customer service.” \nWith each subsequent trip, the conversations continued and something began to click. Michelle and Kunal talked about the differences between Australia and India — where he hails from — about food and even their favourite comedians. \nKunal was a fan of Canadian comic Russell Peters, who is also of Indian descent, and chatted about his routine with Michelle. \nIt was this comedian that saw their relationship go from the purely professional to the personal. \n“I looked him up and sent Kunal a text saying I was watching Russell Peters and he was really quite funny. \n“We kept texting and then Kunal said, ‘would you like to have dinner sometime?’” Michelle didn’t hesitate. She said yes. \nThree weeks after their initial ride, the pair had their first date at an Indian restaurant in Melbourne’s swish Albert Park neighbourhood. Kunal did not pick her up in the cab, said Michelle. Michelle and Kunal with their some Arjun.

But on the next date his repertoire expanded to Mexican, then to Italian and beyond. \nAs the months went on, something more than just gastronomy crossed Kunal’s mind. \n“Being from another culture, I was not a person who could have gone with a girl and just had fun and all that — I’m not into such things. \n“I was quite clear that I liked her and [after] two or three months I said I would like to settle down. I asked if she would like to go with me with me back to Punjab to meet my family and once you meet them we should see if we want to go ahead.” \n“It was very full on,” says Michelle. “Very traditional and I’m not as traditional as Kunal but after spending time with family and getting a better understanding of who he was I remember thinking, yes, I could spend rest of my life with this man.” \nIn September 2013, a year after meeting at the Southern Cross rank, the couple married in Melbourne. Members of Kunal’s family from India made the trip. \n“It is very whirlwindy,” laughs Michelle. Two became three with son Arjun. Their second child is due next week. \nShe never imagined she would meet her future husband on a simple trip home from the coach station. But, on Valentine’s Day, Michelle has a message for the lonely hearts out there. \n“You just never know when you’re going to meet that special someone. They could be anywhere.” \nbenedict.brook@news.com.au ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:33:11.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
