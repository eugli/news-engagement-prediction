Analysts at Edelweiss backed the view, saying \"the high data usage habit\" would be a subscriber retention driver for Jio. \n\nSmall wonder, experts believe Airtel, Vodafone and Idea could be staring at rapid customer losses and plunging revenues amid a sharp likely surge in competitive intensity unleashed by Jio's decision to offer unlimited voice calls and nearly 30 GB of data for a monthly Rs 303 from April. \n\nAnalysts at UBS warned incumbent carriers could see \"an acceleration in customer losses to Jio\" in the next six weeks as subscribers are likely to take advantage of the 4G entrant's new unlimited offer, which is valid before March 31. The foreign brokerage, in fact, is keeping a close watch \"on reactionary unlimited (pack) launches from incumbents to stem potential customer losses\". \n\nAnalysts at HSBC agreed incumbent telcos \"don't have much choice other than matching Jio\", but the brokerage voiced scepticism about Idea and Vodafone India's ability to do so immediately, given their limited 4G spectrum holdings by comparision. \n\nSo much so, the brokerage feels incumbents may be compelled to boost data capacity on a war footing and accelerate investments in fibre backhaul with a sharper 4G focus, and also look at swiftly refarming the low 900 MHz spectrum band for fourth-generation mobile broadband services. \n\nBrokerage Credit Suisse, in turn, said Jio's Rs 303 per month offer is perhaps \"the first unlimited voice + data plan in India that effectively puts a cap on the ARPU (average revenue per user) of all higher-end subscribers\" of incumbent operators and could be ARPU dilutive. \n\n\"Nearly 50 per cent of revenue of incumbent operators like Bharti Airtel come from subscribers with Rs 300-plus ARPU (with average levels of Rs 550-plus). Jio's Rs 303 per month plan puts an ARPU ceiling on all such subscribers,\" said Credit Suisse in a note. \n\nIndustry experts agree that any effort to match Jio's tariffs could progressively shave off nearly 40-50 per cent of the revenue that Airtel, Vodafone and Idea typically generate from higher-end customers, which would hit the overall ARPU and hurt both top-line and bottom-line in the coming quarters.
