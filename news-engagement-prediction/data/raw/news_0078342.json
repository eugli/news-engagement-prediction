(Supplied: Facebook) \nMs Edwards said she was awaiting a report on Sheals that would not be ready for several months, but did not say what it was in reference to. \nSheals, who was dressed in a red-checked flannelette shirt and a navy blue jacket did not speak during the court appearance. \nHe was released on bail and ordered to return to court to enter pleas on May 1. \nThe intersection where the crash occurred is one of several between Cooee and Wynyard scheduled to be upgraded. \nWaratah Wynyard Council said a final design was being developed following community consultation.
