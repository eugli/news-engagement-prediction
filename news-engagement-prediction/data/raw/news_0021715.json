Again. (page 37) \nAuditors have a bad reputation. People typically conflate ‘auditor’ with the guys at the IRS who harass taxpayers. \nThis isn’t the case. \nAuditors actually work for you. \nTheir job is to be an independent, objective set of eyes. They go into a company on your behalf and review all the records to make sure that there’s no fraud or deceit. \nEvery year, big companies submit their financial statements to auditors for inspection, and auditors spend weeks doing their own studies to determine if those statements accurately reflect the company’s true condition. \nIn fact, our agriculture company is undergoing an audit right now by a large, international accounting firm. \nIt’s important: audits provide an independent assessment to the shareholders indicating that everything we’ve said about the company is true. \nNeedless to say, when a company fails its audit report, it’s a BIG deal. \nThat’s what happened to the US government. \nThe government submits its own financial statements each year to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), its in-house auditor. \nBut the GAO gave the federal government a failing grade, yet again, and specifically singled out the Defense Department for “serious financial management problems.” \nIf this were a private company, the senior executives would be out on the street and probably facing criminal charges. \n2) The government’s single biggest asset is $1 trillion in student debt (p.81) \nThis is pretty sad. \nLike any large business or bank, the US federal government holds a number of financial investments. \nBig banks, for example, have bonds, loans, and mortgages on their balance sheet. \nFor borrowers and homeowners, a mortgage is a liability. We owe the bank money. \nBut to a bank, a loan is an asset; they’ve loaned the money, and they’re the ones receiving interest payments each month from us. \nThe government also holds loans as financial assets– specifically student loans. \nAs of September 30, 2016, America’s youth owed the federal government $953.6 billion from student loans. \nBy the end of December, that number increased another $100 billion to $1.05 trillion. \nThis constitutes the US government’s single biggest asset, even more than the aggregate value of their aircraft carriers or national parks. \nIn other words, the government’s most lucrative asset is the continued indentured servitude of young people in the Land of the Free. \n3) This is just the tip of the iceberg… there’s so much more to tell you. \nClick here to listen in on today’s podcast– I’ll explain how, based on the government’s own numbers, their actual “net worth” is nearly MINUS $100 TRILLION. \nWe’ll debunk so many myths from the debt sheep who think it doesn’t matter. \nAnd we’ll discuss a VERY plausible scenario about how this could play out over the next few years… as well as some simple strategies to limit your exposure. \nListen in here.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:02:05.858+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
