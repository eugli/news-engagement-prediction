Middlesbrough booked their place in the quarter-finals (Photo: REUTERS) \nGrant Leadbitter opened the scoring with a penalty won by Stewart Downing. \nThen Gestede made it two, with an overhead kick from Fabio's cross that sealed the game. \nThe drama was far from over. Karanka says he loves the cup but almost pays price for making changes \nThere can be no doubting that Aitor Karanka respects the cup, having flown over Wembley a few years ago and decided to “win something” at the stadium. \nBut he made seven changes for this game. He wants to use the cup as an “incentive” for his squad players who are pushing to start in the league. \nTrouble is many of his players were not good enough here in the second half, after cruising to a comfortable lead. Aitor Karanka almost saw his side crash out (Photo: REUTERS) Are alarm bells ringing at Boro's poor form? \nChairman Steve Gibson sat stern faced, looking miserable, in the directors box as Oxford made their come back. \nHe needn't have worried. \nThis was Boro's third win of the year... all have come in the cup which is proving a lifeline for Karanka and the fans. \nA run of one win in 11 in the league needs to change quickly. Oxford's best FA Cup show for 23 years, but it ends here \nNot since 1994, when they lost to Chelsea, had Oxford reached the 5th round stage. \nA win would have won only their second quarter final appearance, the last in 1964 when they lost to Preston. \nThey looked finished at half time but boss Michael Appleton must have made a brilliant team talk to spark such a comeback. \nHis side deserved a relay but one late lapse and they were denied. Oxford had fought back from 2-0 down (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Oxford comeback sparked by Maguire free kick goal.. \nChris Maguire made amends for conceding a penalty by getting Oxford back in the game. \nHe curled in a great free kick from 18 yards out, dinking over the defensive wall, after being fouled by Adama Traore. Brad Guzan was poorly positioned. \nWithin a minute Oxford were level, thanks to Antonio Martinez. \nMaguire was influential again, getting into a dangerous position on the left of the box and smashing a shot that Guzan couldn't hold. Chris Maguire scored a stunning free-kick... (Photo: REUTERS) ... but his joy turned to dejection (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \nMartinez mopped up the rebound. \nUnited were also denied a first half goal. \nKane Hemmings was pressurising Bernado when Maguire dinked a good ball inside the back line. \nBernado tripped and slid out a leg as the ball flew into the net. Referee Andre Marriner judged the Boro defender had been tripped. January signing Rudy Gestede gets his first goal \nKaranka wants him to pressure Alvaro Negredo for the starting striker berth, and he's doing just that. \nHe scored a lovely overhead kick after Fabio's cross caused confusion in the visiting defence. \nIt was an improvised goal and Negredo, on the bench, will have taken not that more is needed from him in the league in the coming weeks. \nIndeed Negredo came on late, and helped make the winner. That's the sort of competition for places Boro need. Rudy Gestede finally broke his duck for Boro (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T19:47:43.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
