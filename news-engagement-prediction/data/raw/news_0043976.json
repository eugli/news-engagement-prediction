She was not really wrong. But Karan can hardly be blamed because nepotism is not an aberration in Bollywood. It is the norm. \nIn the latest episode of Koffee With Karan, Kangana Ranaut, an absolutely self-made superstar without big-studio patronage (the kind Anushka Sharma got), called Karan Johar the \"flag-bearer of nepotism.\" Of course, in good humour. \nThere is good reason to call Karan Johar so. Karan launched Alia Bhatt and Varun Dhawan . He made multiple films with Imran Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan. He literally has projects ready (or they are in the process of being launched) for the next generation of star-kids; Saif Ali Khan 's daughter Sara Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor 's cousin Ishan Khattar and Sridevi's daughter Jhanvi Kapoor. Karan Johar will most definitely produce the film of Shah Rukh's son as well. Duh. \nALSO READ: Sara Ali Khan replaces Disha Patani in Student Of The Year 2 \nAnyway, this is not a piece about bashing Karan Johar who is, by the way, a great film producer with an excellent understanding of cinema and the business itself. It needs foresight to green-light a film like Kapoor & Sons and distribute a film like The Ghazi Attack. If Karan Johar has signed star-kids with an aim to mould superstars out of them, then that is because Johar is the king of an understanding that was already in place before Johar was born: Children of stars have the first, most exclusive rights to become stars. Period. \nALSO READ: Jhanvi Kapoor to debut in a Karan Johar project, confirms daddy Boney Kapoor \nHere's the thing: nepotism in Bollywood is not an aberration. It is the norm. There is nothing wrong about it in the same way lot of wrongs are normalised in society. Nepotism exists in politics, majorly; you have the Gandhis, the Yadavs, the Paswans, the Abdullahs in the North. Down south, you have the Karunanidhi family. To an extent, nepotism has not been able to raise its horns in sports as much as it has in cinema and politics because the worth of a sportsperson is measured by statistics and performance visible to all. Politics, on the other hand, is a game of rhetoric. And cinema is, well, smoke and mirrors. \nComing back to nepotism in the film industry, the logic behind it is the same logic that applies to a doctor wanting his son to be a doctor, a carpenter wanting his child to be a carpenter, a grocery-shop owner getting his kid to drop from school and join the 'family business', so on and so forth. A child born in a star-household grows up with the belief that yes, \" Main banoonga film star! \" The producers stay ready. The race begins: who will be the first to sign them? Soon enough, an entire coterie of people, including producers, PR agencies, the paparazzi and showbiz media get together to make sensations out of people who have literally never appeared on the big screen. Is there any reason for Jhanvi Kapoor or Sara Ali Khan to be news? NO. But they are news. And their family doesn't mind it. And neither do their producers. Because more the publicity, more the money. \nALSO READ: Aryan Khan to Jhanvi Kapoor, when star kids become more popular than their star parents \nNow, star-kids can fail. Multiple times. The time they have in hand to deliver flops before they may be, somehow, probably, kinda-sorta become a saleable face is more than the time an outsider gets. Dia Mirza and Kareena Kapoor arrived in Bollywood at the same time. At the start, both were equally less-talented as the other. Dia was prettier though. Nevertheless, Kareena got the bigger films. Dia did not. Both Kareena and Dia kept starring in flops but Kareena thrived because there was a machinery already in place to ensure that Kareena does not not become a star! \nSometimes, nothing can help you. Case in point: Imran Khan, Jackky Bhagnani, Abhishek Bachchan, Uday Chopra, etc. Sometimes, an outsider, thanks to her talent, luck and the right people noticing him or her, manages to break though the nepotism industry and make it BIG.
