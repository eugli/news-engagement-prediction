ANC MP Rosina Semenya received a R10,000 watch from a \"friend\" and a meat pack priced at R201.95 from County Fair. \nHuman Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu, known for snacking on and sharing chocolate in the House, received chocolates and wine from the Turkish embassy, a cake plate from Malaysia and a biscuit basket from Standard Bank. \nAmong the more popular gifts for MPs were tickets to sporting and social events such as the Durban July, the J&B Met, the Cape Town Jazz Festival and Kaizer Chiefs football matches. \nAlso popular were wine and whisky, tea, biscuits, fruit platters, and ties and socks. \nThree MPs other than the 14 did not disclose their interests but the committee condoned the omissions on the grounds that two of them had been sworn in as MPs after the August elections and the third had been seriously ill. \nLast year DA leader Mmusi Maimane landed in hot water for failing to disclose funds he had received for his campaign for the leadership of his party. \nSingh said a committee had been established to investigate and \"we should get a response within the next 30 days\". \nThis year Maimane declared a R25,000 cash gift from Alpha, a Christian mission organisation in London, a R10,000 painting from artist Helene Kapp, a painting of himself and Nelson Mandela, a revolving pencil holder and three pairs of socks, sent monthly for six months.
