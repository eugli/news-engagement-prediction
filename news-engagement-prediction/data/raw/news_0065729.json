When we got back, we went out in London and had a really good night! It was a bar up in town. We went with some players — Frank Lampard, John Terry, Ashley Cole. Great night. The big players did not want him to go.’ There was sadness for Clement, too. It was the end of an association with Chelsea that began as an academy coach in the mid-1990s. Clement left his role with the Chelsea backroom team when Ancelotti was brutally fired He followed Carlo Ancelotti to Paris Saint-Germain before cutting his own career as a manager ‘It was at Harlington at the weekends, midweek we used to train at Battersea Park. It was very different there in 1995,' he recalled. ‘We were hiring an old Astroturf. While we were training, the hockey players were warming up and getting changed. It was rock hard. I used to keep the balls in the back of the car. I’d have to pump them up myself and there was no kit. ‘That was training the Under 14s and Under 16s. I can remember Carlton Cole coming off the train. He would have his BMX and he would ride down but he would always be late and always have a big smile on his face.’ Clement was made Ancelotti’s assistant in 2009 and Chelsea won the Double in the management duo’s first season together. He returns to Stamford Bridge on Saturday for the first time since his sudden departure ‘It was a brilliant learning experience,’ said Clement. ‘I was working with a great coach in Carlo. What I remember about that season is how mature and strong the team were. Cech, Terry, Ballack, Lampard, Essien, Drogba . . . strong characters.’ Clement’s Swansea face the league leaders today having won four of their last six Premier League games and Clement says it will be a proud moment. ‘It’s special,’ he said. ‘To coach against them is an honour. I am excited, as are the players.’ RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T13:52:28.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
