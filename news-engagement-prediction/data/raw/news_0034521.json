We were listening to the songs from outside,” said Yash Vardhan, 24, a Vikhroli resident. \n“I am a newbie at Kala Ghoda and I’ve been having a fabulous throughout. These concerts made my day,” said Prabhas Das, 27, a banker from Andheri who was lucky enough to make it inside for the gig. \n“I was amazed to see a concert this big so well-organised. I follow Bollywood music closely and tonight, Javed Ali covered all the songs I love, especially ‘Khwaja mere Khwaja’,” said Abhishek Shah, 26, a businessman from Vile Parle. \nRead ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:49.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
