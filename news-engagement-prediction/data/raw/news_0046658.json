But Future has a full-on shark tank in his bedroom , not to mention the row of rides out front that rep the luxury he dispenses line by line over the course of the track and the flash of diamonds in every other frame. \nIs \"Super Trapper\" may be the best Cribs episode that isn't actually a Cribs episode?
