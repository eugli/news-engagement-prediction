Yes there was a lot of talking, but if you really listened to the writing it gave you a great sense of what happened before Robin Hood was actually...well Robin Hood. The action scenes were great and even though he really didn't use his bow very much, it made sense in the context of the movie, seeing as no man in their right mind would fight hundreds of men with just a bow. He's a man, not Legolas. And for the people who say the story was horrible or whatever, you maybe should have looked at the title screen when the movie first started. It boldly said BEFORE Sherwood Forest and all the other stuff. So if you were expecting all that stuff throughout the movie and was saying \"WHAT THE HECK! IT CAN'T BE OVER RIGHT WHEN THE ACTUAL STORY STARTS!!!\" when the movie ended, it's your fault for not reading. Preconception Misconceptions = Dumb by AkuTaco It seems to me that most people who went to see this movie and didn't like it felt that way because they had preconceived notions of what it was supposed to be.Personally, I prefer the portrayal of Robin Hood as a talented strategist and rabble rouser. The plot was top notch, although it clearly lacked enough screaming and blood for many. However, it seems to me that every action on the part of every character had meaning. The acting was top notch, as were costumes, set design, and everything else in this movie. In short the only reason not to like this movie is if it wasn't what you were expecting, which is a pretty poor reason in my estimation. Russell Crowe is Robin Hood by young director... This movie is definitely one that you have to have an acquired taste for. If you prefer a new look and a sense of realism to myth this is your movie. Yes, it's missing the flare of humor and fantasy that was in the other Robin films... but that's what it was aiming at. Plus, if Ridley Scott is going to direct something, it's going to be pretty realistic. This is a great look on the legendary figure, with a great cast to portray it. My vote is 80 out of one hundred.
