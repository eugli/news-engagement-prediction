Around 6 lakh people have been allegedly cheated by the accused trio who have now been arrested. \n“The company was formed in 2010. In 2015, they took to social media urging people to like pages and other thins. In return, they promised to pay Rs 6 per like. This included the Re 1 commission. They even created several fake pages and circulated among people. They also circulated YouTube links and other profiles of users,” he said. \nWhen asked about the involvement of outsiders, he said, “We have not found involvement of outsiders (companies).” \n“The STF, ADM Finance Office Noida and concerned departments have received several complaints. Following this, we started studying this online, it took little time but finally we managed to bust it,” he added. \nAfter showing negative growth in 2017, there were chances that the trio would have declared the company bankrupt and dissolved it. \nAlarmed by the scale and modus operandi used in this scam, the STF has created a special email id to deal with such complaints. The STF has asked people to direct their complaints via email to - \nThe trio were arrested yesterday by the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force from their Noida-based ‘digital marketing’ company, 3W Digital Private Limited office on Wednesday and seized nearly Rs 500 crore.

However, the links sent to them were fake,\" he said. \nDuring the probe, it was found that over 6.5 lakh people had deposited over Rs 3,726 crore in the company's accounts using over nine lakh IDs. \nThe STF got a clue after investors started alleging that they were not getting the money after which a detailed probe was initiated. \nSTF said the company's director passed out of a B Tech course in computer science in 2010 and set up a company which earned Rs 3-4 lakh per annum till 2015 after which he floated socialtrade.biz online portal for the fraud. \nSTF has also informed the Reserve Bank of India, Income Tax department and the Securities and Exchange Board of India for further action in this regard. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T12:16:16.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
