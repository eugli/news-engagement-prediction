Disneyland park goers are going to experience Fantasyland in a whole new way as the story of this Disney classic comes to life. \nThe Village Haus Restaurant will become the Red Rose Taverne! The inside will be decorated with murals from scenes from the film and each room will tell a different chapter from the storyline. The menu will be delicious quick service meals and yes you'll be able to try the \"Grey Stuff.\" All very similar to the Be Our Guests restuarnate at Walt Disney World in Florida. \nIn addition to Red Rose Taverne it looks like Maurice's Treats Snack Cart will have an update. Marinara, strawberry and Grey Stuff dipping sauces will be available to be paired with the bread sticks. So, exciting! \nHopefully you'll even run into Gaston who will be making appearances in Fantasyland.
