( SHLD ) back in growth mode? Apparently it's having visions that all is just fine and dandy.\nWith little fanfare, Sears opened a full-service auto care facility called DieHard Auto Center Driven by Sears in San Antonio last week. The news of its debut was first reported by Automotive News . Similar to a Pep Boys , Sears' auto service stop provides oil changes, tire replacement and vehicle repairs and assessments. Unlike Sears Auto Centers, the Diehard Auto Center isn't attached to a Sears store or in a parking lot of one.\nIn effect, the store may be nothing more than Sears trying to showcase the brand's potential. To raise cash last May, Sears put its three best-known brands—Craftsman, Diehard and Kenmore—up for sale. Back in January, Stanley Black & Decker ( SWK ) acquired the Craftsman brand from Sears for a total consideration of $900 million. Stanley Black & Decker will pay Sears $525 million in cash on an undisclosed closing date, $250 million three years after the deal has closed, and annual payments on new Stanley Black & Decker Craftsman sales through year 15.\nGiven its current financial state, Sears is need of speeding up the sale of its Diehard and Kenmore brands.\nSears burned through $1.6 billion in cash last year, said Fitch Ratings recently , adding that it expects the company to run through another $1.8 billion this year. As a result, Fitch estimated Sears will have to raise some $2 billion in liquidity in 2017, roughly in line with the annual average over the past five years, just to keep the doors open.", "external_links": ["http://www.autonews.com/article/20170221/RETAIL05/170229966/sears-launches-free-standing-pilot-diehard-auto-center"], "published": "2017-02-27T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:06:03.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
