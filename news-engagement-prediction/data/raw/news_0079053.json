He is coming off a season in which he had 106 catches for 1,284 yards and 12 touchdowns, earning his fifth Pro Bowl selection. \nBrown’s production is unquestioned. but it’s his on-field antics that have come under fire lately. He was fined multiple times last season for end-zone dances that also drew unsportsmanlike penalties. \nBut it was what Brown did after the Steelers’ playoff win over the Dolphins in January that drew the most scrutiny. Brown recorded the Pittsburgh locker room on Facebook Live following the win and inadvertently caught Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin using profanity as he tried to motivate his players for the Patriots. He apologized to his teammates and coaches for the incident. \nBrown was entering the final year of a six-year, $43 million contract that he signed before the 2012 season.
