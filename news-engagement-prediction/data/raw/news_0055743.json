REUTERS/Neil Hall \nYou didn't get a calendar alert; you got one while you were distracted by something else; you planned to put together a presentation last night and instead fell asleep on the couch. \nThe truth is, you're the only one who cares about your excuse for being unprepared for a meeting. \nWhat you need to focus on now is how to handle the situation so that you don't make a fool of yourself, your boss, or your department. Without panicking. \nAccording to Rosalinda Oropeza Randall, an etiquette and civility expert and the author of \" Don't Burp in the Boardroom ,\" as soon as you realize you're unprepared, you should tell your boss . \n\"Own it,\" Randall said. \"Take responsibility for it.\" If you're lucky, they'll have some of the information you were supposed to gather. \n\"They'll appreciate that, even though they'll probably be mad at you,\" Randall added. \"It takes guts and courage to own up to a mistake , no matter what it is. And that's a good trait.\" \nIn the case that you don't talk to your boss beforehand — or if you somehow don't realize you're unprepared until the middle of the meeting — simply say, \"I'm sorry. I don't have that information with me today.\" \nOf course, in either scenario, your boss may talk to you after the meeting about why exactly you were unprepared — so be ready for that conversation.
