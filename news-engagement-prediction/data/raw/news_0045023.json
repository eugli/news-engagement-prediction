The package-delivery giant teamed up with Workhorse Group, a drone developer based in Ohio, to carry out the test on Monday. The drone launches from the top of a UPS truck to autonomously deliver a package via a preset destination while the delivery driver continues driving and making separate deliveries. UPS says the system could one day aid deliveries in rural areas. Here's the full release . Tesla Q4 earnings preview: Don’t worry about the numbers \nWhen Tesla reveals its fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow, investors will be more interested in updates on the Model 3, Gigafactory, and battery production than the company's profit and loss. The fledgling electric car manufacturer has promised to deliver 50,000 cars in the second half of 2016 . Last quarter it delivered over 24,000 cars. It also hopes to produce 500,000 cars annually by 2018. In Q3 it produced over 25,000 vehicles. \nWhile the business is growing, so too are capital expenditures. Analysts estimate a loss of 43 cents a share on revenue of $2.19 billion. The company expects to reach $1.8 billion in costs for the year. As long as Tesla continues to hit its own benchmarks, investors aren't likely to be concerned with losses. Tesla Seize the day!

Send ”Like” farms are still a big problem for Facebook \nA recent Facebook dustup is serving as a fresh reminder of the social network's longstanding battle against \"like\" farming—which is basically when scammers post outrageous or attention-getting content for the express purpose of collecting likes and shares for profit. In the latest case in point, a U.K. mother discovered scammers using a photo of her child covered in chicken pox , the BBC reported today. The photo was real, except the scammers claimed the boy had cancer and that Facebook would donate money toward his medical bills if the post collected enough likes and comments. \nThese kinds of deceitful \"call to action\" posts have been a corrosive force on Facebook for years, but they've proven frustratingly difficult to completely wipe out. The aforementioned cancer-boy scheme was reportedly back online within 24 hours of Facebook having removed it. Read the full story here . Verizon gets a $350 million discount on Yahoo \nHow much are a billion hacked accounts worth? Verizon and Yahoo said today they amended the terms of their long-suffering merger. Under the new deal, Verizon will pay $4.48 billion in cash for Yahoo's internet business, $350 million less than the original figure . The discount comes after revelations of two massive hacks against Yahoo, which compromised 500 million and 1 billion user accounts, respectively. Read the full release here . CZ 02.21.17 | 8:00 am Intuit says the on-demand economy is only getting bigger \nIntuit released its second annual on-demand economy report today. The company surveyed some 6,200 people working on Lyft, Amazon Mechanical Turk, Upwork, TaskRabbit, Wonolo, MBO Partners, OnForce, Work Market, Catalant, Field Nation, Kelly Services, and Avvo. Here are some key stats from the report: \n• 1 in 5 people come to the on-demand economy for work because they have fallen on financial hardship. \n• 41% of workers in this industry are female. \n• Average age of an on demand worker is 40. \n• 64% are white; 11% are black; 10% are hispanic; 7% are Asian; 9% identify otherwise. \n• 41% of on demand workers have either traditional full-time or part-time work. \n• 48% say that working on-demand gigs helps them to maintain their financial position rather than improve it. \n• 90% of workers love the freedom on determining their schedule and the way they work; only 50% are highly satisfied with this setup in practice. \nThis report says to me that a good chunk of on-demand economy workers have turned to this industry because the traditional jobs market has failed them by cutting their hours or generally not providing enough work. Another 29% of workers are working on-demand jobs to pay off a medical expense, which means health care is also failing these Americans. While the gig economy seems to be helping certain people stay afloat in difficult times, this report says that for half of its workers, the on-demand economy is just a shoddy band-aid . And this industry is set to grow. Intuit and partner Emergent Research predict the workforce will grow from 3.9 million Americans to 9.2 million in 2021.
