Police arrived and arrested him. \nThe 44-year-old received hospital treatment for injuries suffered in the altercation. \nWhile in custody, his home was destroyed by a fire which claimed the life of a pet cat. \n“At this point, police have not confirmed that these incidents are linked, however given the time line, investigators will consider this as a possible investigative avenue.” states an RCMP news release. \nPolice say the cause of the fire is unknown. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
