Coffee won't get any cheaper but many will find it harder to pay rent: Greens MP Adam Bandt said. Photo: AAP \nHowever, Australian Retailers Association executive director Russell Zimmerman said the decision would grow the sector. \n\"Reducing these rates from double time to time and a half, will increase retail growth nationally and reduce the unemployment rate in Australia,\" he said. \nMs Kearney said that was a \"complete furphy\". \nOn Twitter, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said people relied on penalty rates. \n\"I stand with all these workers, all these mums and dads, all these young people, every day of the week,\" he wrote. \n\"The Liberals will try and wash their hands of this decision. Don't let them. They've laid the groundwork for years.\" \nIn Queensland the Palaszczuk government called on Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to intervene following the Fair Work Commission's decision to slash Sunday penalty rates. \nMs Palaszczuk said the decision would leave some Queenslanders losing up to $6000 a year. \n\"Clearly the Turnbull government needs to intervene and put an end to these cuts to the take-home pay of Queensland workers,\" Ms Palaszczuk said in a statement. Another budget built on shifting sands \nGreens MP Adam Bandt says his party will immediately move in parliament to stop the cuts coming into effect. \n\"This cut in penalty rates is a cut in people's wages and it will hit young people especially hard... Coffees won't get any cheaper on Sundays but young people will find it harder to pay the rent,\" Mr Bandt said. \nHe called on Labor and the cross bench to support his party's move to block the cuts. Member for Melbourne Adam Bandt has called on the ALP and the cross bench to back a Greens move to block the pay cuts. Photo: AAP \nThe Fair Work Commission said the 25 per cent pay cuts would help businesses trade longer and offer more services on Sundays and public holidays. \nFair Work Commission president Iain Ross said Sunday penalty rates would still be higher than for Saturdays. \n\"Generally speaking, for many workers, Sunday work has a higher level of disutility than Saturday work,\" he said on Thursday. \n\"Though the extent of the disutility is much less than in times past.\" \nMr Ross said the commission took evidence from business owners that Sunday penalty rates had led employers to restrict trading hours and reduce staff levels. \n\"The evidence also supports the proposition that a reduction in penalty rates is likely to lead to increased trading hours, an increase in the level and range of services offered on Sundays and public holidays and an increase in overall hours worked,\" he said. \nThe cuts will come out of worker's pay packets from July.
