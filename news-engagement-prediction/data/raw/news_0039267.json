Renovated by Sydney's Infinite Design, Mosman Houseboat is a most unusual dwelling. Prue Ruscoe \nWhen Macarounas gained the commission to open up the dark lower level with the heavy, nautical-referencing kitchen and lounge, and sort out the upper-level master bedroom, ensuite and small study, she made the decision to spend time alone at Pearl Bay \"to experience the serenity and to better understand the environment\". \nAlong with the heritage onus to respect and restore the old timbers that have long framed windows and formed the kitchen bench, she saw her job as \"not adding too many elements that would lose that serenity\". \nApart from a pair of oars, there was to be \"no cliche nautical references. It's very much a heritage cottage\", she says. The Mosman Houseboat is surrounded by water views. Prue Ruscoe \nAlthough she does find it amusing that the occupants can fish while sitting on the lounge. \n\"My aim was to open it to light and to pare back the materials to be more simple than it had been.\" \nIn her research, Macarounas discovered whole suites of marine-grade materials that she's beginning to swing into her more conventional jobs. \n\"It was a massive learning curve to understand all the function and facilities of a house on the water\". Interior designer Michelle Macarounas spent time alone in Pearl Bay to learn about the environment. Prue Ruscoe \nSince the awards nominations, including a People's Choice vote, Infinite Design has fielded calls from owners of moving water craft who want her tasteful touch on their boats. \n\"It might be part of our next stage,\" she says. \n\"An interesting deviation on what we've been doing.\" Renovated by Sydney's high-end Infinite Design studio, Mosman Houseboat is the most unusual dwelling contesting the heritage conservation category of this year's Mosman Design Awards, which will be announced on March 6.
