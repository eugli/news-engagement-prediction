The attack is said to have happened on the popular Donauinsel (Danube Island) in the Austrian capital of Vienna, filled with bars and restaurants. The children, aged one and two, were unharmed in the incident. The attacker, reportedly a 17 year old, managed to throw the woman to the ground and climbed on top of her but she fought back. She eventually stopped him when she bit him on the nose when he tried to kiss her, reports said. She then called police as he ran off, and using CCTV images and a sniffer dog they were able to follow him to a nearby train station where he was arrested. He was later identified by his torn coat and by his alleged victim.
