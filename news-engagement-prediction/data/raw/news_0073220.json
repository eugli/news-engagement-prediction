(Twitter/ @bradTTC) Kayla Goodfield, CTV News Toronto Published Thursday, February 23, 2017 8:14AM EST Last Updated Thursday, February 23, 2017 9:06AM EST \nA SUV is stuck inside a tunnel designated for TTC vehicles causing streetcars to be unable to enter Union Station. \nToronto police said they responded to a call that came in around 4:30 a.m. on Thursday. \nAccording to Const. Jenifferjit Sidhu, a vehicle drove into the Union Loop and got stuck on the streetcar tracks. \nInvestigators initially said that the driver had fled the scene and abandoned the vehicle. But, Sidhu told CP24 that the driver later returned to the scene. \nAccording to the TTC, the 509 Habourfront and 510 Spadina streetcars are currently turning back at Spadina and Queens Quay. \nDuring this time, shuttle buses are operating to take passengers inside Union Station. \nOn Twitter, TTC spokesperson Brad Ross said the operator of the vehicle fled the scene on foot. \n“This will take some time to clear. Far more than it took the driver to get to this point, unfortunately. They fled, for the record,” Ross said in a tweet. This will take some time to clear.

On Twitter, he said a similar incident occurred last April. For those wondering, this happened last April. Wasn't @Drake 's fault. https://t.co/4T0351bdVk — Brad Ross (@bradTTC) February 23, 2017 \nSidhu said the car will need to be towed, but that will take a while to happen. \nPolice have not yet said whether the driver will face any charges in connection with the incident.
