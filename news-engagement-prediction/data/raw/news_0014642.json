Hansen: Misdeeds of Bill Kintner, Keith Williams didn't happen in ... - omaha.com Advertisements \n#Nebraska Football 's coaching shuffle might continue against their wishes if the school isn't careful. While the Huskers are still looking for another defensive coach to add to their staff, the offensive side of the ball has been set for a while now. That could change after LSU fired its receivers coach a few days ago. One has to think #keith williams is going to be on the short list of assistants, and that the Tigers will be offering up a truckload of money in the coming days. After doling out big bucks to the school's new defensive coordinator it might be time to open up the wallet once again. Losing Keith Williams \nNo, LSU hasn't made any formal offers to the Nebraska football wide receivers coach that we know of. That doesn't mean they won't be looking in our direction in short order. There's very little doubt that he's considered among the best of the best at his position, both as a man who can turn good receivers into great ones and for bringing in truly talented players. There's very little doubt that LSU likely has the money to make sure they are bringing in the best of the best. \nIt should also be pointed out that Williams has a deep understanding of Louisana. The Huskers' wide receivers coach had the same position at Tulane before he joined the Nebraska football team. One has to wonder just how much love he has for the bayou and whether that might be a factor. We might see first-hand in the coming days and weeks if he loves that part of the country more. Keeping Keith Williams \nOn the flip side, the wide receivers coach is helping to build something that could be a better situation than any he finds at LSU. The Tigers appear to be in a bit of a state of flux after firing Les Miles in the middle of the season last year. They still had a good year when compared to most schools, but the recent firing of more assistants has to give a coach pause. There is also the loyalty factor when it comes to the Nebraska football staff. Mike Riley kept Williams on board when many were calling for his dismissal this summer after being arrested for a DWI offense. \nFinally, and perhaps the best factor in the Huskers' favor is that NU clearly has the money to bring in and keep the best. If Mike Riley wants Keith Williams to remain a member of the Nebraska football family, the coach is likely going to get paid to stick around.
