The film, directed by Gauri Shinde, tactfully highlighted mental health with its simple storyline. Now, months after the release, the makers have released a deleted 5-minute clip from the film. \n\nThe deleted scene, shot in the ruins of a fort in Goa, has Shah Rukh at his philosophical best as he imparts some of his wisdom to Alia (Kyra) in the form of a history lesson with an underlining message. The clip, which is believed to be one of the many scenes that didn't make the final cut, owing to run-time issues, has SRK narrating the story of a young Brazilian girl Dona Maria, who under the disguise of a man named Balthasar, went on to become a Corporal in the ranks of the Portuguese army. \n\nWatch their endearing conversation in the video below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T00:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:52:24.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
