Someone else typed: 'She's 100% pregnant!' Someone else took the bull by the horns and tagged Charlotte in the comment so as to try and get her full attention: '@charlottegshore are you pregs?' Smoke and mirrors? Shot from an aerial angle, the pale green coloured wool dress, nipped in at the waist with a chunky black belt, appears to fall over the 26-year-old's stomach at an angle that suggests she could have a hint of a bump Someone else began to ramble about the likelihood of a Charlotte/Bear baby: 'Bearz always saying he wants a baby bear wen he meets a women so is she ???' Another referred to Charlotte's dress at last week's BRIT awards, which had also received pregnancy comments: 'She looks pregnant. In her Brit pic she was holding her stomach!' However, InTheStyle took to the same Instagram thread to shut down the rumours, posting: 'GIRLS!! We can confirm Charlotte is not pregnant - are you joking, look at her amazing figure!!!
