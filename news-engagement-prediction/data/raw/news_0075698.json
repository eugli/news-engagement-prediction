Trump . \n\"The governor remains largely unaffected by national politics,\" said Kromer, director of the Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Goucher, which conducted the poll. \"He continues to earn high approval ratings and the majority of Maryland voters are at least leaning toward giving Governor Hogan another term in office.\" \nThe poll found 63 percent of Marylanders approve of the job Hogan is doing, down seven percentage points from the college's last poll. Fifty-seven percent said they would either definitely re-elect him in 2018 or were leaning toward voting for him. The poll has 3.5-point margin of error. \nHogan has been under pressure from Democrats and a few public protests to take a position on Trump's actions and agenda. He has declined to do so, saying he is focused on Maryland and should not weigh in on national politics. The poll found 44 percent of people thought Hogan spent \"the right amount of time\" addressing national issue, and about 30 percent found he did not spend enough.

Additionally, 62 percent of surveyed residents said the state was moving in the right direction. \nTrump, by contrast, has support from 29 percent of Maryland residents. \n\"There's very little evidence that a 'Trump effect' is having any bearing,\" Kromer said. \"People don't expect the governor of a state to be that involved in national politics.\" \nKromer said that the 7-percentage point decline from Hogan's all-time high job approval rating of 70 percent in September can be attributed to a normal decline governor's experience while the General Assembly is in session and they share the public stage with lawmakers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:51:08.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
