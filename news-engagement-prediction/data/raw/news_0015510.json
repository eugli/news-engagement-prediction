The model was bound to turn heads during her day of fun and relaxation\nMaking a splash! The star ran her hands through her hair after taking a dip\nThe nuptials were between her ex Justin Bieber's best friend, photographer Joe Termini and Kelia Moniz in Honolulu.\nHailey was no doubt pleased to spend the weekend letting loose with friends following the news that her father Stephen Baldwin is set to lose his house.\nA foreclosure auction is officially set for March 16 at Rockland County Courthouse, according to court documents obtained by DailyMail.com, with the actor's New York home is planned to be sold off to the highest bidder.\nHat's off to her! The catwalk queen left the beach wearing a white hat\nFun with friends: Baldwin couldn't have looked happier as she strolled on the surf beside a pal\nHair today: After undoing her top knot, Hailey submerged herself into the water\nBack in 2013, Deutsche Bank filed a foreclosure lawsuit against Stephen and his wife, Kennya, accusing them of defaulting on their loan by failing to make payments.\nStephen, 50, had originally taken out an $812,500 loan to purchase the four-bedroom, four-bathroom, 3,071 square-foot house in Upper Grandview in 2000. The couple were to pay nearly $7,000 a month on the mortgage.\nHe stopped paying his mortgage in 2011, however, and at the time of the filing, he owed almost $800,000 on the loan, according to Deutsche Bank.\nWhoa, there! Testing out the waters, Hailey first cautiously approached the ocean blue\nHitting the road: Baldwin returned to the car with several belongings\nNot a hair out of place! The star fussed around with her bun, doing it as she hit the water\nLast year, the bank demanded the case move forward, even after Stephen blew off the lawsuit completely. The bank pleaded for the green light to begin the foreclosure process and to force the actor to pay his current debt owed on the mortgage, which had snowballed into a whopping $1.1 million - plus interest.\nThe star finally headed to court, hoping to have the entire foreclosure lawsuit thrown out and save the property from being sold at auction.\nMeanwhile, Hailey may be a rising star in the modelling world with an international career to boot, but the beauty finds the large amount of travelling a little lonely sometimes.\n'It's tough sometimes, the thing I've been struggling with the most is I miss my family,' she told Glamour magazine last year.\n'I think about my parents and I'm like, \"Wow I really haven't seen them in a long time\". Things get pretty lonely, I'm not going to lie, some of the most famous people you'll see are truly some of the most lonely. It's very sad.'\nToned and terrific! Dipping her toes in the water, Baldwin no doubt turned heads during her beach excursion\nLife's good!
