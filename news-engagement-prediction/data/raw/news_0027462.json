And with all the rain, it’s getting washed into puddles, lakes, streams and ponds. And that’s how dogs are being exposed to it.” \nGoussev said they’ve already seen five cases in the last two months. That’s more than they typically seen in an entire year. \n“Most typically, the signs commonly we will see first will be decrease in appetite to complete anorexia, vomiting, some dogs will actually show a yellow tinge to their mucus membranes or skin.” \nShe says pet owners can minimize exposure by avoiding taking dogs to wet marshy areas. \nAnd there’s also a vaccine, which 4-year old Oscar already got. \nDog owner Megan Moser said, “I thought my dog could potentially come in contact and it could be life threatening…so that was kind of my decision, lifestyle and the fact that rainy seasons will kind of make it more prevalent.” \nFor many dogs, the disease is treatable, but getting an infected pet to the vet early, is key. Infected pets usually show signs about seven days after exposure. \nGoussev said, “With more wet weather on the way, we will probably see more cases as spring progresses.” Jessica Flores Follow Jessica Flores joins KPIX 5 as a reporter, after spending three years in Phoenix covering stories throughout Arizona.
