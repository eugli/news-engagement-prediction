Berkovec in particular looked to be in trouble, and the referee and his teammates frantically signaled for medical attention immediately.\nSlovacko striker Francis Kone took direct action though, leaning over the goalkeeper and pulling the unconscious player’s tongue out of his mouth to keep him from swallowing it. The intervention saved Berkovec’s life.\nAnd the craziest part? According to the hero himself, this isn’t the first time Kone’s saved a life on the pitch.\n“It has been four times,” Kone said. “Once in Thailand and twice in Africa. I’m always checking the players, to make sure they have not swallowed their tongue.”\nFollowing Kone’s successful intervention, Berkovec underwent a CT scan at the hospital and spent the night under observation. He is expected to make a full recovery.\nKone has been roundly praised in the Czech Republic for his action, and the man whose life he saved took to Facebook to express his gratitude.\n“I would like to thank Francis Kone for rescue and emergency at today’s game,” the goalkeeper said. “I’m glad for the relief and thanks again!!!”\nThis article originally appeared on Fox Sports US \nOriginally published as Moment quick thinking rival saves keeper’s life", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:37:19.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
