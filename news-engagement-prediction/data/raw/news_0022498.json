Most of these are loans given during 2007-08-09 period when the boom period of the economy was there,\" he said.\n\"Your allegation is that your sins have not been corrected and reversed by us. This cannot be a charge on us,\" said the Finance Minister.\nJaitley said disproportionate loans were given by the UPA to certain industries and that they were not farmers.\nDocuments which have come out say that loans were given through intervention of the North Block and the concerned bank officials were having to pay for it now, he said, in an apparent reference to cases being filed against some bank officials in connection with Mallya case.\n\"These were not to small people. It was to big companies. It was your legacy, it was your contribution. Our misfortune is that every year the interest goes up and so it becomes 5.1 per cent from 4.1 per cent and then becomes 6.1,\" he said, adding the NDA was paying \"interest\" on UPA's work.\nJaitley further said the problem was not with NDA's management of the banks but with \"over management\" of the banks by the previous government.\nParticipating in the debate yesterday, Congress member Veerappa Moily had attacked NDA over the growing NPAs of the banks.\nDuring Jaitley's reply, Moily said loan growth has become \"three-decadal low\" and that it had not happened in the history of the country.\nJaitley, acknowledging that there was decline in loan growth, said NPAs grew due to \"indiscriminate loans\" given by the UPA.\nSome of these NPAs were being hidden under the carpet, he said.\nWithout mentioning Rahul Gandhi's name, he further said \"your leader, infinite number of times, said we gave some Rs 1,200 crore advantage to one person who fled to London.\n\"I heard this at least a dozen times, not a rupee advantage by any bank since 26 May 2014 has been given to that person by any any bank. This falsehood has been repeated indefinitely.\n\"But now the documents which have come out, say this was happening not by the banks but this was happening through intervention of the North Block and the banks officials are having to pay for it now,\" he said.\nThe Finance Minister further said, \"the problem of NPAs was partly the slowdown (of loan growth). But it is substantially due to the over management of the banking system you did and the indiscriminate loans that were given during that period to a select few and to those major industries.\n\"Unfortunately now you have shifted allegation and said we did all this what have you done to manage it and correct it,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:21:05.042+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
