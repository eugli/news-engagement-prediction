The Atlanta singer-sometimes-rapper has been buzzing heavily since his last release, Free 6lac k, and the upwards trend is only continuing with his latest collaboration, a duet alongside Jhene Aiko . This isn't even the biggest co-sign he's received as a singer, The Weeknd has already given 6lack his seal of approval, enlisting him for the North American leg of his Starboy tour, as well as bringing him out for a surprise performance in LA. Despite being from ATL, he definitely has a TO-approved sound. \nThe joint record, \"First F*ck,\" is the perfect bedroom jam, with a slow-moving beat that finds 6lack drawling about spending a night with a ladyfriend, before Jhene chimes in with her perspective. Take a listen. \nWe'll keep you posted if more information on the collaboration arrives.
