It culminates in his trial and includes the famous bulletproof glass booth in which Eichmann sat, expressionless, as Holocaust survivors recounted the horrors for which he was responsible.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\nThat trial marked a turning point for survivors, said Avner Avraham, exhibition curator and the former agent of Mossad, Israel's secret intelligence service, who first developed the exhibit. Before that public airing, Avraham said, \"you have to remember that most Holocaust survivors felt ashamed.\"\nMaking its second U.S. stop, the temporary exhibit is co-produced by Mossad, and Avraham originally developed it as an in-house exhibit, drawing on the spy agency's rich trove of artifacts preserved from the Eichmann capture.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saw it there, Avraham said, \"and said, 'Why don't you bring it to the Knesset' — Israeli parliament — 'and open it to the public?'\"\nThere is more background material in the American version, he said, but the essence of it, rooted in artifacts from the capture mission and in the tale of the mission, is the same.\n\"In a world where people are so interested in James Bond and these kind of stories,\" said Arielle Weininger, curator for the Skokie museum, \"this is the real deal.\"\nEichmann was a leading architect of Adolf Hitler's \"Final Solution.\" The Nazi SS lieutenant colonel organized the logistics of moving Eastern Europe's Jews to ghettos and extermination camps.\nAs a prisoner of war after the war, Eichmann was thought to be the soldier \"Otto Eckmann,\" the second of four names he would use. He escaped and worked in rural Germany, and then, with the help of an ex-Nazi network and Catholic convents and monasteries, made his way to Italy. As Ricardo Klement, he sailed for Argentina in 1950, where he would work for Mercedes-Benz.\nTwo years later, his wife and children would join him, and it was a son's teenage romance that would tip Israel to the true identity of this German expatriate car executive.\n\"It all starts with a love story,\" Avraham said. \"It starts with a girl meets a boy, and the boy is Eichmann's son. He didn't know that her father is a half Jew, half Christian Holocaust survivor from Dachau.\"\nThe son apparently didn't do much to hide his identity. Although his father was still Klement, the son went by \"Nick Eichmann,\" and the girl's father overheard enough to become \"convinced that his daughter's friend was in fact Klaus Eichmann, the oldest son of the long-missing war criminal,\" the exhibit's text says.\nThe father wrote to an old acquaintance back in Germany, who then notified the young state of Israel, and the hunt was on.\nTo tell too much of how Eichmann was identified, captured and smuggled out of Argentina is to take away some of the power of this exhibition. Visitors will want to read the wall cards, even as they view the actual Leica camera, for instance, used to photograph the man and the passport fabricated for him to leave Argentina under the name Zeev Zichroni.\nThere are even the gloves one agent wore, because, Weininger said, \"he specifically wore gloves because he did not want to touch Eichmann ... The objects are amazing.\"\nWhen it comes to the trial room, an innovative triptych video presentation tells the story. With the glass booth at the center, three screens simultaneously show witness testimony, Eichmann and those who attended the trial.\n\"It's actually a new way to tell the story of the Holocaust ,\" Avraham said of \"Operation Finale.\" \"People know all the pictures from Auschwitz and the people with the clothes like pajamas. We all know it. But when you have the first big spy operation for the Mossad with all the people and the details, 11 agents, the plane, the ship, Plan A and Plan B … the main glory is to bring a Nazi alive to trial in Israel.\"\nsajohnson@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter: @StevenKJohnson\nWhen : Until June 18\nWhere : Illinois Holocaust Museum and Education Center, 9603 Woods Drive, Skokie\nTickets : Free with museum admission (adults, $12; students and seniors, $8, children 5-11, $6); www.ilholocaustmuseum.org\nRELATED STORIES:\nHolocaust Museum, new 3-D technology bring survivor stories to life\nHolocaust film reveals the pain of bringing autobiography to screen\nFirm that shaped national African-American museum hired for Obama museum\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\n Museums Israel The Holocaust (1934-1945)", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ade594/turbine/ct-operation-finale-holocaust-museum-ent-0223-20170222", "http://d3ik2vfsvyg6fu.cloudfront.net/a/embed.html#layout=", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58af16d4/turbine/chi-movie-reviews-pictures-pg", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58b09607/turbine/ct-greg-kot-album-reviews-pictures-pg"], "published": "2017-02-23T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:57:22.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
