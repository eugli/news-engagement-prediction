It was afraid that if it imposed sanctions, or if it did anything more drastic, Iran would pull out of the nuclear agreement. It’s already collected up-front billions of dollars and revived its economy, and also cashed in on the dissolution of the international sanctions, which will never be reinstated — China and Russia wont go along with it. So what the Trump admin is doing is saying: Those days are over. We are not afraid of you doing something to the nuclear deal; we are going to respond point by point to the violations in terms of aggression in the region, and especially the ballistic missile launches, which we object to and we are going to punish, it appears to be for now, with sanctions.
