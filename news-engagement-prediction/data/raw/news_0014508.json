Settlers and their supporters had been pushing the new legislation as a way to avoid similar rulings in other unauthorized communities built in occupied territory. But critics say the measure is illegal and would make peace with the Palestinians even more difficult.

The White House said new construction \"may not be helpful\" in achieving peace. \nThat admonishment marked the first public disagreement between Trump and Netanyahu, who plans to visit the White House Feb. 15. \nRelated: U.S. Warns Israel to Stop Announcing New West Bank Settlements . \nSettlements are one of the most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians. About 600,000 Jewish settlers live in about 140 settlements built in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas captured in the Six-Day War of 1967. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks to President Donald Trump during their meeting in New York on Sept. 25, 2016. Kobi Gideon/Government Press Office / Reuters \nMuch of the international community, including the United Nations and the European Union, consider the settlements to be an illegal taking of land envisioned as a future homeland for Palestinians. \nFor more than two decades, U.S. foreign policy has been pushing for a negotiated peace deal —a \"two-state solution\" — that would include the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. \nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump said peace between Israel and the Palestinians could be achieved only through direct negotiations, indicating that he believes Israel shouldn't be allowed to act unilaterally.
