PHOTO | COURTESY By NAIROBI NEWS REPORTER \nHarambee Stars captain, Victor Wanyama has been blasted by a Tottenham Hotspur teammate for his poor dress code. \nIn what perhaps stands out as a tongue in cheek statement, Wanyama was singled out alongside Eric Dier by England defender Danny Rose, as having the “worst” fashion sense at the club. \nRose told Soccer AM when asked about worst fashion offenders at the London club: “He (Dier) comes in the biggest gear you could ever imagine, he’s probably top of the list,” he said, adding “Victor Wanyama is a close second, he came in a fur hoodie the other day. It looked like he’d stolen something from Pat Butcher out of Eastenders.” \nIMPRESSIVE DISPLAYS \nWhat can’t be disputed about Wanyama, who joined Tottenham from Southampton mid last year, is his impressive displays at the club. \nThe midfielder has featured in all Spurs league matches this season and is yet to lose a match at the White Hart Lane. \nWhat’s more, he was earlier this week named the English Premier League African Player of the Month of January, ahead of Chelsea’s Victor Moses and Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure.
