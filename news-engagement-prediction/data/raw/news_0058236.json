ABUSE.\" The little pony was filmed eating carrots from a bowl while awkwardly sitting in a high chair (Photo: suetoshi_farm/instagram) \nAnother wrote: \"Cute but not good for their back\" \nAnd another said: \"It's not funny !!!

This is animal cruelty.\" \nWhile another said: \"Understanding the anatomy of a horses gut, digestive system and the position of the organs would tell you never to do this.\" \nHowever, some people claimed it could be good for the horse to sit straight in a chair while they eat - as it can apparently ease the symptoms of megaesophagus, a malformation of the esophagus that makes it hard to swallow for a miniature horse .
