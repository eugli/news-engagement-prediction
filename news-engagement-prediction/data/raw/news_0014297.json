Perez had been available since the Braves released him Dec. 8. \n[RELATED: Updated Cubs Depth Chart] \nThe 25-year-old Perez saw fairly extensive action the past two seasons in Atlanta, where he made 34 appearances (31 starts) and logged a 5.18 ERA, 5.3 K/9 and 3.5 BB/9 over 170 1/3 innings. All 11 of Perez’s appearances came via starts in 2016, and his results were unsightly (6.04 ERA) despite the fact that he paired a high ground-ball percentage (57.1) with a quality walk rate (2.52 per nine innings). \nPerez’s new organization has one of the majors’ top rotations on paper with Jon Lester , Jake Arrieta , Kyle Hendricks , John Lackey and either Mark Montgomery or Brett Anderson , though the need for more depth is obvious. The Cubs are cognizant of that, having added Perez, swingman Casey Kelly (another ex-Brave) and Eddie Butler in recent days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:54:08.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
