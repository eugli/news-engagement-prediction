After what felt like an eternity with some long points, Alvidrez was able to persevere and get the final touch to clinch the meet with 14 points, and St. Peter's Prep went on to win by a score of 16-11 in the NJSIAA boys fencing state finals Wednesday at Morris Hills High. \n\"It was pretty crazy,\" said Alvidrez. \"When he scored three straight I kind of got caught up in some rules stuff. I was just trying to get out of it and run down the time as much as possible. Obviously, he came into a spot where I can hit him and I took advantage of that.\" \n\"It means everything to us, said junior Sean FitzGibbon . \"It gives validation to the countless hours we've put into this at practices. It means everything to the seniors because this is their last hurrah and there is no better way to do it than being number one in the state.\" \nA meet that was close throughout saw St. Peter's Prep make a huge charge at the end to earn the state title. The Marauders only led by two points, 10-8, before a sabre sweep by Dalton Walker , Bryce Besler and Owen Possick put them in complete control. \nIt was redemption for Walker, who got off to an inauspicious start in an upset loss to Columbia's Matt Rothenberg in the first bout of the entire meet. It only gave Columbia a 1-0 lead, but it could have given the Cougars some huge confidence since Walker had only lost twice all season. However, Walker earned victories in each of his next two bouts, and his teammates rallied around him. \n\"I was pretty mad, since it's only my second defeat of the season,\" said Walker. \"I knew I had the team around me and that one bout probably wouldn't make the difference at the end. I knew I could count on everyone else to get the wins.\" \nFollowing the loss by Walker, St. Peter's Prep also survived a sweep by Tran Soles-Torres , Jack Woods and Moramarco in the first foil round that gave Columbia an early 5-2 lead. \nA turning point in the meet was a 5-4 victory by FitzGibbon in the second round at epee over Isiah Ogbeifun to give St. Peter's Prep a 10-7 lead, its biggest of the meet at that point. The bout came down to the final point and a win by Ogbeifun could have changed the course of the meet. \n\"I wanted to just keep working,\" said Fitzgibbon. \"With our coach yelling at us, it's easy to always stay motivated, especially in such a big meet with everything on the line. I just wanted to keep going at it.\" \nSt. Peter's Prep brought its fencing program back about a decade ago after it ended in the 1960's and this state championship is huge in putting the program on the map. \n\"It gives validation to fencing at our school,\" said Walker. \"Our school really only focuses on football, hockey and basketball, so it will bring more attention to our sport. It shows people that this is a real sport and not just something people do to earn an easy varsity letter.\" \nThe state championship marked an end to an undefeated season for St. Peter's Prep, including a 15-12 victory over Columbia during the regular season. \n\"It's a pretty big thing because we haven't had a fencing team very long, compared to a team like Columbia,\" said Alvidrez. \"It's just a big achievement. We've really been working hard this entire season and we've been on the brink the past couple of years.\" \nContact Matt Bove at .
