(Sheryl DeVore / News-Sun) \nWhen Christopher Sanders, 13, needs to relax and de-stress, he doesn't necessarily turn to video games — though he does enjoy them. \nMore often, though, he grabs a hook and starts crocheting chains. \nChristopher, a seventh-grader at Palombi Middle School in Lake Villa, has even taken the time to crochet bracelets in his school's colors for the student council. \n\"I made about 100 of them,\" and yes, his friends do wear them, he said. \nHis brother, Kendall, 11, who also is learning to knit and crochet, said, \"I can't believe he did all that.\" Knitting Sheryl DeVore / Lake County News-Sun Loretta Fivizzani helps Savannah Sanders (left) with a project at a knitting class offered by Fivizzani in her Round Lake Beach home.

(Sheryl DeVore / Lake County News-Sun) \nChristopher, Kendall and their sister, Savannah, 6, are taking free lessons from their neighbor Loretta Fivizzani, who's been knitting for 50 years, learning to do so at an orphanage where she grew up, she said. \n\"I picked up two bobby pins, and learned and made a little scarf for my dolly,\" she said. \nEver since she moved to Round Lake Beach from Morton Grove 11 years ago, she's been offering free knitting and crocheting lessons to youngsters in the neighborhood. They walk over or their parents drop them off for about an hour — sometimes they come together; other times they get individualized lessons. They call her Ms. Loretta. \nFivizzani's adult knitting group, which meets weekly in Zion, donates the yarn and needles. \n\"I want there to always be knitters on the planet,\" she said.

In a recent survey of knitters, the council reported that 37 respondents knew a child who knitted or crocheted, and believed those youngster's self-confidence and concentration skills improved when they began the craft. \nIn the United Kingdom, sewing and knitting was the fastest-growing hobby trend for youngsters in 2016, according to Tesco PLC , a large department store chain in Great Britain. Demand for kids' sewing and knitting kits has soared by nearly 500 percent in 2016, the chain reported. \nChristopher's parents, Bobbi and Justin Sanders, are happy their sons and daughter are learning the skill. In fact, Bobbi said her husband does most of the sewing in the family. \n\"Knitting is a lost art, and I'm glad they're keeping it alive,\" she said of her children. The military family lives in Round Lake Beach. \nChristopher is nonplussed about the idea of him being a teenage boy and learning to knit and crochet. He's got plenty of friends and other hobbies, he said. He loves sports and is trying out this spring for his school's football team. He gets good grades — and he enjoys being with Fivizzani, a kind of surrogate grandmother, he said. \n\"I'm here almost every day after school,\" Christopher said, while taking a lesson at Fivizzani's house with a few other students on a warm Friday afternoon. \n\"I started knitting at first. It was confusing. Now I crochet. It calms me,\" he said. \"When we're knitting, we talk about everything — but especially history and books.\" Knitting Sheryl DeVore / Lake County News-Sun Studies show that youngsters who learn to knit and crochet can improve their motor coordination, reading and problem-solving abilities.

They laughed as he stood at the top of her stairway and dropped chain after chain he crocheted to the living room floor where Fivizzani's cats, Knit and Purl, were waiting to pounce on the yarn. \nThough Fivizzani's students love to play videos and spend time on their tablets, they also love to be creative. \n\"After three hours on video, what do you have to show for it?\" Fivizzani said. \nWhen you knit and crochet, you can \"make stuff,\" Kendall said. \"It's cool. I've made bracelets and dish cloths.\" \nAnother student, Hailie Wozny, 6, made a headband and matching bracelets with soft white yarn with Fivizzani's help. \nHer mother, Donna Wozny, said, \"Hailie loves arts and crafts. She loves coloring. When Loretta asked her if she wanted to learn to knit, I was more than happy and Hailie was thrilled.\" \nChristopher has crocheted colorful dish cloths as a present for his uncle. \n\"He liked it. I made 12,\" he said. Knitting Sheryl DeVore / Lake County News-Sun Hailie Wozny, 6, works on her knitting while wearing a headband and bracelets she created with yarn.

It keeps her busy and it brings out her artistic side.\" \nNow Christopher is teaching his friends to create crochet chains. \nHe and one of his friends play video games for about half an hour, then go outside for a pick-up game of basketball or baseball when the weather is warm, he said. \n\"When I stay overnight at his house, we sometimes crochet,\" he said. \nThough some parents don't want their boys to learn to knit, the attitude is changing, Fivizzani said, to which Christopher replied, \"Boys can do anything girls can do, and girls can do anything boys can do.\" \nSheryl DeVore is a freelance reporter for the News-Sun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:16:06.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
