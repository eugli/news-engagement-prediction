Shah Rukh and Madhuri’s passionate love story set against the backdrop of a dance musical can almost be considered Hindi cinema’s first successful attempt at a musical. Casually whistle SRK’s lazy tune from the movie and it’s sure to turn heads even on today. Although packaged as a rom-com, the movie depicted several different dimensions of relationships. Back then, when movies like ‘Hum Aapke Hain Kaun’ struck a chord with the audience, a film like ‘DTPH’ was a risk, and a risk well taken by Yash Raj. It was one of the first films, which focused on the close friendship between a boy and a girl and the pain of ‘being friend-zoned’. Farah Khan and Shaimak Davar choreographed some amazing dance pieces for the play sequence in the movie. Uttam Singh’s music became such an instant hit that the 90’s kids still hum the tunes of ‘DTPH’. As the movie turns 20, here are 8 lesser-known facts about ‘DTPH’ ‘DTPH’ was initially called ‘Thevar’ with Shah Rukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit and Manisha Koirala in the lead. However, Koirala had second thoughts about the story and dropped out. Nisha’s role was then offered to Juhi Chawla. Chawla didn’t take up the film as she didn’t want to play second lead to Madhuri Dixit Yash Chopra then approached Kajol, to play Nisha. She too turned it down. The role then went to Urmila Matondkar who declined the offer. Finally, Karishma Kapoor bagged the role. She was the fifth choice for the character of Nisha. Karisma, won the National Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. ‘Maine To Mohabbat Kar Li’ was another title that was considered for the film. Shiamak Davar began his career in choreography for Hindi films with ‘DTPH’ and he went on to win the National Award for best Choreography.
