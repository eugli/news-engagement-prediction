By Julia Brucculieri \nThe late ‘90s and early ‘00s were a rich time for boy bands ― *NSYNC, Backstreet Boys, 98 Degrees ― who sang lyrics filled with sexual innuendos our pre-pubescent ears just didn’t quite understand. But it seems there was at least one “band” that tried to keep it real. \nEnter Thr33way, the “first-ever honest boy band,” formed by James Corden , Nick Kroll and Jordan Peele . In a clip from “The Late Late Show,” the three guys opened up about their group’s mission. \n“We took existing boy band songs, cut through all the innuendo, and just got to the heart of what those songs are really about: hardcore sex,” Kroll explained. \nThe “band” released songs like “I Want a Three-Way,” set to the tune of BSB’s “I Want It That Way,” and “Quit Playin’ Games with My Penis,” set to “Quit Playin’ Games with My Heart.” Then there were hits like “End of the Choad,” “Bye Bye Bi-Sexual,” “The Butt Stuff,” and of course, “MMMBoobs.” (You can probably guess how that one went.) \nThings quickly went downhill for Thr33way after that last track. Add in a terrible interview with Mario Lopez, and the “band” was pretty much done.” For Peele and Kroll, it’s been a dark time. Corden, on the other hand, has “no regrets.” \nCheck out their story above.
