It didn't go down well. \nThe reason for this may seem obvious: jobs. But there's more to it than that. Thanks to analysis by the Grattan Institute think tank, we can drill down further, and look at the trends for job growth in the cities compared to regional areas. The picture that emerges is of one country with two rapidly diverging stories: regional and urban. The economies of small towns are being hollowed out by the flow of jobs to the cities, which have been growing less affordable. \nIf you're not yet working full-time, this is about where you may end up working. City or country. Ten years ago, with Kevin 07, there was a dream of national broadband allowing an exodus to the country, of savvy young professionals in 'virtual offices' collaborating with each other across distance. You can still see that hope in the NBN ads on TV right now.

Instead, according to Grattan CEO John Daley, at a recent speech, fast internet has actually increased the value of being physically close to each other. Productivity is higher in offices. Our city centres are becoming more dense. \nFirst, here's exactly what Mr Joyce told national radio : \"I get annoyed when people talk about that the only house that you can buy apparently is in Sydney and it's too dear. \n\"Houses will always be incredibly expensive if you can see the Opera House and the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Just accept that. Houses are much cheaper in Tamworth, houses are much cheaper in Armidale, houses are much cheaper in Toowoomba.\" \nIt was quickly pointed out there was a reason houses were much cheaper. Tamworth has an unemployment rate of 7.46 per cent (Sydney's is 3.82 per cent). Youth unemployment in Joyce's electorate of New England, which includes Tamworth, is 15.8 per cent (national average is 12 per cent). \nBy comparison, only a day earlier a study confirmed Sydney was the second most expensive city in the world for housing. There are over 270 Sydney suburbs with a median house price above $1 million. Not many have harbour views. One country, two stories. \nThe graphics below are from a presentation given by the Grattan Institute at a Canberra productivity conference in December . \nHere's what they show. 1. The future is in services, and service jobs are city jobs \nWe are all spending more money on services. Service jobs, such as education and health, management and hospitality, tend to be city jobs. \nAgriculture, manufacturing and mining - three big regional industries - are declining. \nConstruction is up, but that's mostly in the cities. \nServices growth is accelerating. 2. Cities, not the country, are the 'engine room' of the economy \nRegional areas will sometimes claim their hard work is propping up the rest of the country. The data shows economic activity tends to be concentrated in the cities. \nBig cities dominate Australia's economy. 3. City centres have been sucking up jobs since the GFC \nThis graph is a bit hard to follow, but it basically shows a massive spike in inner-city jobs in Sydney and Melbourne between 2006 and 2011. This mimics the trend in the US after the 2007 Global Financial Crisis. In the US at least, it looks like jobs growth outside the city centre collapsed. \nThe inner-city began sucking up jobs around 2008. 4. All this is bad news for the Nationals (incl. Barnaby Joyce) \nThe lack of jobs in regional areas has reportedly led to a bunch of people voting for minor parties, and not for the Liberals, Nationals, Labor or the Greens. \nThe Nationals is a country party, so it's the most affected by this trend. \nMinor parties are gaining votes in the bush. 5. Marginal electorates tend to get new highways \nOne partial solution to housing affordability is to cut down on commuting times. This allows people to buy in the outer suburbs. To do this, governments have to spend more on urban public transport and city road networks. But right now state and Commonwealth road funding is going disproportionately to regional areas, according to the Grattan Institute . In the graph below, if money was being allocated efficiently, the coloured bars should be roughly equal height for each location. \nMarginal electorates tend to get expensive highway upgrades. For example, the federal, NSW and Queensland governments have collectively spent $2.1 billion during the past decade on the New England Highway, which has relatively low levels of traffic. \nGovernment transport spending is not following jobs growth.
