Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.5 percent at 113.64 yen, putting it on track for its biggest one-day gain against the Japanese currency in 12 days. \nConcerns over anti-European Union rhetoric from French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen and Dutch candidate Geert Wilders ahead of the first round of French elections on April 23 and the Netherlands' March 15 parliamentary election combined with the hawkish Fed statements to send the euro as much as 0.8 percent lower to a six-day trough of $1.0526.
