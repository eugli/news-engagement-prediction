Picture: Craig Wilson\nAloiai moved to Liverpool from Auckland when he began his career with the Parramatta Eels, before signing with the Tigers in 2014.\n“When I first moved here I was really, really homesick,” Aloiai said.\n“My family lives here and were amazing in that time, helping me get settled in my home and my church.”\nUnderstandably, Aloiai was excited to revisit his former stomping ground with the Tigers’ Auckland Nines team in New Zealand last weekend.\n“I used to play at Eden Park with the Glenora Bears,” Aloiai said.\n“All my immediate family is back there in Auckland, and I don’t see them that often now I’m here — I’m lucky to get back and visit.”\nmedia_camera Josh Aloiai attempts to bust the tackle of Cowboy's Ben Hannant during last year’s round 22 game between the Wests Tigers and the North Queensland Cowboys at Leichhardt Oval. Picture: Gregg Porteous\nAloiai scored a try against the Melbourne Storm, but the Tigers only triumphed over the Brisbane Broncos after going down to the Storm and Newcastle Knights.\nThe Auckland Nines is only the start of a big season for Aloiai as he seeks to build on his stellar 2016 performance.\nHe ran 1550m and made 426 tackles over 24 matches last year.\n“I had a difficult pre-season with a broken jaw,” Aloiai said.\n“Most of my goals for this season are team focused — we just want to play good footy, and it would be really special to make the eight.”\nAloiai will be with the Tigers until at least the end of 2017, striving for success alongside teammates who have also become friends.\n“The boys are amazing — it’s a diverse side, lots of different cultures, personalities and senses of humour,” Aloiai said.\n“I love being here with the Tigers.”\nWests Tigers kick off their season against South Sydney at ANZ Stadium on Friday, March 3.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERS AND NEWS ALERTS", "external_links": ["http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/6cffda9ff319cb4408d87b6bc48992f0?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/9203650b868107b45f7ad176927abbf8?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storymeta/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/liverpool-leader", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fliverpool-leader%2Fnews-story%2F9203650b868107b45f7ad176927abbf8&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fliverpool-leader%2Fnews-story%2F9203650b868107b45f7ad176927abbf8", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fliverpool-leader%2Fnews-story%2F9203650b868107b45f7ad176927abbf8", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/9203650b868107b45f7ad176927abbf8?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storyheader/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/380680e5136ba05e22542902aeb6b2b4?width=1024", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "https://pages.e.newsdigitalmedia.com.au/GPCv2/?a=DailyTelegraph", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/807ab62f8fb23c7b7e2555f25afdb15b?width=650", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Grace%20and%20hard%20work%20for%20Aloiai&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fliverpool-leader%2Fnews-story%2F9203650b868107b45f7ad176927abbf8", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/9203650b868107b45f7ad176927abbf8?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-12T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:24:53.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
