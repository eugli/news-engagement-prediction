UConn women's basketball: The Huskies' record 100-game win streak (and counting) by the numbers Anthony Chiusano | NCAA.com Contact | Archive | RSS \nThe amazement behind UConn women's basketball's current winning streak goes far beyond the unprecented number of 100 — as in consecutive games won by the Huskies, a new NCAA record. \nIt's been a dominating journey filled with blowout after blowout against the stiffest of competition. UConn set the DI basketball record with its 91st straight win over SMU on Jan. 14 and hasn't slowed down since in its unprecedented road toward the century mark. \nHere are some other mind-boggling numbers to come out of UConn's streak: \n818: Days since UConn last lost a game (as of Feb. 13). The Huskies' streak started with a 96-60 win over Creighton in Storrs, Connecticut on Nov. 23, 2014. UConn would finish 38-1 that banner season. \n98: Double-digit wins during the streak. Yes, that means just two of UConn's past 100 victories have even come close to coming down to the wire. There haven't been too many stressful games for the Huskies faithful to watch. \n74: Consecutive wins in AAC play. UConn hasn't lost in conference play since the AAC was formed in 2013-14 -- a year before the winning streak started. \n71: Wins while ranked No. 1 in the AP Top 25. The Huskies have not been ranked lower than No. 3 during the streak. \n65: Largest margin of victory during the streak. As seen two spots above, UConn hasn't played in too many close games. But its biggest blowout came in a 103-37 shellacking against No. 20 South Florida this past month. That resounding victory gave the Huskies their 90th straight victory, tying the all-time record. \n56: Victories by at least 40 points. USF wasn't alone in being simply overmatched. \n46: Win streak before UConn's last loss. The Huskies' last defeat came on Nov. 17, 2014 in an overtime thriller against long-time rival Stanford. That ended a respectable 46-game run. Do the math, and that gives UConn a 146-1 record over its past 147 games. 100!! A career-high 26 points from Gabby Williams helps No. 1 UConn to its 100th-straight win on Monday against No. 6 South Carolina! pic.twitter.com/00ITk0LHYD — UConn Women's Hoops (@UConnWBB) February 14, 2017 \n36: Consecutive road victories during the stretch . The Huskies boast the three best road streaks in women's basketball history. Their current mark surpassed the 34 straight road victories achieved by the program from 2000-04. The mark also tied the men's record (36), which was achieved by Kansas from 1924-28. \n28: Ranked teams beaten during this streak. With all these games against elite foes with equal Final Four aspirations at the end of each respective season, there has had to be at least one setback right? Not for these Huskies. \n12: More wins than the men's record. The UCLA men's team, led by coach John Wooden, won 88 straight games from 1970-74. UConn now has two separate win streaks that surpass that total. \n9: Wins over top five opponents. UConn has faced the best of the best during this run and hasn't faltered yet. The Huskies have already beaten then-No. 2 Baylor, then-No. 2 Notre Dame and then-No. 4 Maryland this season. \n9: Ranked teams beaten this season. UConn's nonconference schedule was unforgiving to open the season, but that didn't stop the No. 1 Huskies. UConn has knocked off No. 12 Florida State, No. 2 Baylor, No. 15 DePaul, No. 14 Texas, No. 2 Notre Dame, No. 12 Ohio State, No. 4 Maryland, No. 20 USF and most recently No. 6 South Carolina so far this season. \n2: Least amount of points allowed in a single quarter during the streak. UConn held SMU to two points in the opening quarter of the record 91st straight win. \n2: National titles won during streak. The Huskies have won four straight championships and 11 total in program history.
