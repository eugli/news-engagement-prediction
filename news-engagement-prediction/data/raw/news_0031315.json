People will have to come to the authority only when they are required to take the test or get their vehicle checked. Those unable to avail the services online can call and fix time between 9am and 10pm. A transport official will come to your home and do the required work,” said Jain at an event to unveil the Arvind Kejriwal-government’s two-year report card .

Sisodia said work on another big promise of AAP, free WiFi in the city, is also on. \n“WiFi is something which is not available anywhere in the country. WiFi is available at airports and smaller establishments, but world over not many cities have free WiFi. We had a dream and we have worked on this with commitment. There were many hurdles as Delhi might be geographically small but it is densely populated. We have studied many models and zeroed in on a few. But it was a promise of pannch saal Kejriwal and not do saal Kejriwal,” said Sisodia. \nThe deputy CM said the biggest achievement of the AAP government has been that it is fast moving on the path to realise the dream with which the city residents gave the unprecedented mandate in 2015 assembly elections. \n“A disconnect had set in between the priorities we have in personal life and the way people in government plan and prioritise. While education and health top the list of any household, they fall of the priorities list in the government. One of our biggest achievements has been that we have plugged this disconnect in two years,” said Sisodia.

As we went along we took several innovative decisions such as odd-even, bill banao inam pao scheme, reading melas and parent-teacher meetings in schools,” he said. \nWhile the AAP government has shared an ‘uneasy’ relationship with the bureaucracy, the ministers also tried to reach out by giving all credit of implementing the decisions of the government and delivering the achievements. Besides the deputy CM and Gopal Rai, Chief secretary MM Kutty also appealed the officers to contribute in service delivery as desired by the Delhi government. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:12:03.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
