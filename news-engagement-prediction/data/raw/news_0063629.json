There was a lot at stake for both Shiv Sena and the BJP , two saffron allies for over 20 years, who have been going through a fallout. Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray had openly criticised the BJP government in the state under Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s demonetisation scheme. For the most part of the day, it looked as if the Shiv Sena would run away with an absolute majority for more time but BJP changed gears towards the end of the day and raced to 82 seats. Although, since none of the parties gained the required 114 seats to reach an absolute majority, the picture still remains unclear as to who will take over the reigns of the richest Municipal corporation in the world.\nIn the weeks leading to the BMC polls, Shiv Sena had launched a series of attacks directed towards the Bhartiya Janata Party. Shiv Sena supremo Uddhav Thackeray had spoken against the demonetisation drive citing the problems faced by the common man. Later, after weeks of silence on the part of BJP, the party had released a cartoon video, calling Shiv Sena as the “Khau Sena” and criticised it for its corrupt activities. Earlier today, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari is happy with BJP’s performance and congratulated party workers. “For the first time, BJP has got such unprecedented success. I congratulate Maharashtra CM &BJP workers,” he had said.\nHere is the list of winners for Shiv Sena\nTejasvini Ghosalkar\nAnil Kokil\nShraddha Jadhav\nMilind Vaidya\nSindhu Masurkar\nSwapnil Tembvalkar\nSurendra Baglar\nVishakha Raut\nSuresh Patil\nArundhati Dhudhadvkar\nDeepali Gosavi\nList of winners for BJP:\nNeil Somaia\nParag Shah\nAnita Panchal\nAnuradha Poddar\nHarshda Navorkar\nDeepak Thakur\nManoj Kotak\nPrakash Gangadhare\nKalpana Keni\nMadhoon Prabhakar Shinde\nSmita Kamble\nList of winners for Congress :\nAsha Koparkar\nAsha Koparkar Sushma Kamlesh Rai\nSushma Kamlesh RaiVinni Disojha\nVinni DisojhaNikita Nikam\nNikita Nikam\n(Further details awaited)\nMeanwhile, in Pune, the BJP was leading the battle with 77 seats and was well on its way to defeat the Sharad Pawar-led National Congress Party. Congress, Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) are trailing way behind in Pune. It must be noted that 82 wards were needed for an absolute majority and BJP is inching closer. However, if they fall short of that mark, Shiv Sena could play the pivotal role. The bitter allies could come together in the city despite differences between the party heads.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:19:38.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
