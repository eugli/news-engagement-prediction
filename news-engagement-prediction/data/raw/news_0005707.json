He answered, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a people person, and he‚Äôll keep the people‚Äôs interest at heart.‚Äù The fake reporter then asked the man if he thought that Rob‚Äôs relationship with Blac Chyna would help improve America‚Äôs relationship with the country of China. ü§£ü§£üôÉü§£ü§£ A video posted by ROBERT KARDASHIAN (@robkardashian) on Feb 2, 2017 at 9:34pm PST ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to say it can‚Äôt hurt.
