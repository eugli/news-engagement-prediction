  \nJohn Cena defends the WWE Championship against five other men in the gruelling Elimination Chamber match tonight. \nThe 16-time world champion faces AJ Styles, Dean Ambrose, Bray Wyatt, The Miz and Baron Corbin inside the intimidating steel structure. \nThe winner of the contest will not only hold SmackDown's top prize - they will earn a clash against Randy Orton in the main event of WrestleMania. \nLast month's Royal Rumble winner will also be in action, as The Viper takes on his former Wyatt Family ally Luke Harper. \nAmerican Alpha defend the SmackDown tag titles against five other duos and Naomi challenges Alexa Bliss for SmackDown's women's gold. \nHere is a match-by-match breakdown of the show. (Photo: © WWE) \nTag team turmoil match for the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship \nAmerican Alpha (c) vs. Heath Slater and Rhyno vs. Breezango vs. The Usos vs. The Ascension vs. The Vaudevillains \nChad Gable and Jason Jordan haven't had the chance to get their teeth into a proper feud since defeating The Wyatt Family to capture the SmackDown Tag Team Championship at the end of last year. Their first opponents were scheduled to be The Hype Bros, but after Zack Ryder injured his knee, that plan went out the window. Tonight they face five other pairings in a tag team turmoil match, with a different unit entering the ring until only one duo remain. American Alpha surely won't lose the belts so early into their reign, meaning one of the other teams must assert their credentials as the number one challengers. Former champions Heath Slater and Rhyno are unlikely to repeat their success of last autumn, while Breezango's Fandango and Tyler Breeze have never been taken that seriously by WWE management. The same goes for The Ascension, despite Viktor securing a pinfall against Rhyno in a 12-man tag team match on SmackDown this week. That leaves The Vaudevillians, yet to make their mark on the main roster, and former champions The Usos. American Alpha still have a score to settle with Jey and Jimmy, after a storyline saw them injure Gable's knee last September, preventing the duo from competing at Backlash. The Usos running Gable and Jordan close before demanding a shot at their belts in weeks to come seems the most likely scenario. \nPredicted winners: American Alpha \nSingles match \nNikki Bella vs. Natalya \nThe feud between Nikki Bella and Natalya began at Survivor Series when Nattie's ambush on the captain of Team SmackDown's women's team prevented her from taking part in the event. Since Natalya admitted her involvement at the end of December, she and Bella have traded increasingly personal insults. The Queen of Harts questioned Nikki’s wrestling ability and route to success in WWE, while Nikki implied Nattie was only where she was in the business because of her uncle, WWE Hall of Famer Bret 'The Hitman' Hart. In response Natalya claimed she was better than her uncle, which was still all pretty routine comments from a heel, given that Raw's Women's Champion Charlotte has repeatedly made the same claim in relation to her father, Ric Flair. But Natalya stepped it up a level by suggesting that once her looks fade, Nikki’s boyfriend John Cena will leave her and she will \"die alone\". Harsh. Expect an intense brawl, with Nikki getting a measure of retribution. \nPredicted winner: Nikki Bella \n2-on-1 handicap match \nApollo Crews and Kalisto vs. Dolph Ziggler \nDolph Ziggler's heel turn has bubbled along since he superkicked Kalisto at the end of 2016. That was in response to the Mexican coming to his aid when Baron Corbin was attacking the Show Off with a steel chair. His ungrateful response drew the ire of Kalisto's pal Apollo Crews, but Ziggler shoved him and then attacked them both with steel chairs the following week. His heat was amped up with a controversial segment in which he mocked Jerry 'The King' Lawler for the heart attack he legitimately suffered on Raw five years ago, after a match involving Dolph and repeated elbows to his chest. Ziggler ended the verbal spat by superkicking The King in the chest - a statement of WWE's intention to establish him as one of the most hated men on Tuesday nights. His reward for boasting to SmackDown general manager Daniel Bryan that he could beat both Crews and Kalisto at the same time has led to him being handed a 2-on-1 handicap match, when the logical outcome is that he will get some comeuppance for his disrespectful actions. But to fan the flames even higher he should come out on top in this one, with the help of some underhand tactics of course. \nPredicted winner: Dolph Ziggler \nSingles match \nBecky Lynch vs. Mickie James \nIt's great to see a performer of the pedigree of Mickie James - a six time Women's/Divas Champion in WWE - back on SmackDown. She made her return disguised as the masked La Luchadora, who helped SmackDown Women's Champion Alexa Bliss retain her title against former champion Becky Lynch in a steel cage match last month. When James was unmasked she aligned herself with Bliss and in a self-righteous promo explained that she was the forgotten originator of WWE's Women's Revolution, which Becky Lynch has undeservedly been the unofficial poster girl of. The result is a singles bout between the 37-year-old veteran from Richmond, Virginia and Dublin, Ireland's 30-year-old star of the moment. While not marketed specifically as such, this is a dream match between two top stars and could well steal the undercard. The fact there are three women's matches scheduled for tonight's event shows the remarkable transformation in the fortunes of the ladies of WWE and these two talents deserve the chance to prove why that is the case over 15 minutes or so at least. \nPredicted winner: Mickie James \nSingles match for the WWE SmackDown Women's Championship \nAlexa Bliss (c) vs. Naomi \nAlexa Bliss and Naomi may have a job on their hands if their clash over the WWE SmackDown Women's Championship is not to be eclipsed by the efforts of Nikki Bella and Natalya or Mickie James and Becky Lynch. Naomi has emerged as a genuine contender for the title after first defeating Bliss before she won the belt, when Lynch was out injured last year, and since followed that victory up with a key pinfall over the champion in a six-woman tag match at the Royal Rumble. Naomi has always shown top athleticism, but in the past lacked that something extra to make her stand out from the crowd. She now has a tremendous look and entrance to match her ability in the ring and has a genuine chance of capturing gold for the first time in her near seven-year WWE career. However, Bliss plays her villainous role to absolute perfection and what she lacks between the ropes she makes up for with bundles of personality. The pint-sized provocateur should walk out with the championship and hold onto it until at least WrestleMania. \nPredicted winner: Alexa Bliss \nSingles match \nLuke Harper vs. Randy Orton \nThe Royal Rumble 2017 winner Randy Orton is set for a WrestleMania main event - the only question is who will The Viper face? Despite being the bookmakers' overwhelming favourite, the veteran seemed something of an odd choice to win his second Rumble match less than six months after being utterly destroyed by Brock Lesnar at SummerSlam. The logical explanation for the result was that his Wyatt Family leader Bray Wyatt will leave the Elimination Chamber with the WWE Championship, leading to their unlikely alliance coming to an abrupt end and the pair battling it out at the Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida on April 2. The alternative of Orton facing current champion John Cena in the main event - a contest fans have seen countless times before and have no desire to watch yet again - doesn't bear thinking about. In the meantime, Orton has to deal with Luke Harper, the Wyatt subordinate turned rebel who revolted against Randy and then Bray during the Rumble match. Harper has long been one of the best big men in WWE and is finally getting back into his stride following a career-stalling injury. This bout could be a cracking brawl but make no doubt about it, the match will end with an RKO and a one-two-three for Orton. \nPredicted winner: Randy Orton (Photo: © WWE) \nElimination Chamber match for the WWE Championship \nJohn Cena (c) vs. AJ Styles vs. Dean Ambrose vs. The Miz vs. Baron Corbin vs. Bray Wyatt \nWhen SmackDown commissioner Shane McMahon and the show's manager Daniel Bryan announced that John Cena would defend his newly-acquired WWE Championship in the Elimination Chamber, they placated former champion AJ Styles by promising him that he would eventually get his one-on-one rematch. The Phenomenal One is likely to be banging that drum and pointing a finger in Shane McMahon's direction - leading to a possible WrestleMania encounter between the pair - after the chamber has concluded, because he is unlikely to seize back the strap tonight. In truth, a victory for Bray Wyatt as already discussed feels like the only outcome that makes sense, given the victor will face Randy Orton. The challenge for WWE and these six men in those circumstances is to keep fans guessing for as long as possible and make them believe that Styles could indeed win, Cena in fact retain or a shock winner steal the title. \nBaron Corbin's meteoric rise over the last 12 months has elevated him to this esteemed company and he will no doubt look very strong in defeat, while setting up a possible clash with Dean Ambrose over The Lunatic Fringe's Intercontinental Championship. That leaves The Miz, who if rumours are to be believed, may be welcoming his wife Maryse back into the ring in April to challenge Cena and Nikki Bella in a mixed tag match. It will be interesting to see if that plays out with The Miz being the man who costs Cena his chance of main eventing the biggest show of year. But most of all fans and pundits who have long been convinced by the potential of Bray Wyatt as a main event star will hope The New Face of Fear wins convincingly and finally adds a major singles title to his resume. \nPredicted winner: Bray Wyatt \nWatch WWE Elimination Chamber 2017 live on the WWE Network or on Sky Sports Box Office at 1am on Monday, January 30. \nYou can follow all the action as it happens in our Mirror Sport WWE Elimination Chamber Live Blog from 11pm.
