Twitter \nHere’s an accurate math equation for you, Betsy: SMDH X 112 = Me right now. Well, naturally, Twitter absolutely skewered Betsy and the Department of Education as a result. It began with this tweet from the NAACP. \"In the Days of Loose & Careless Logic, We Must Teach Thinkers to THINK.\" – William Edward Burghardt DU Bois https://t.co/3m03Vnt5C1 \nYou hear that, whoever runs the Education Department’s Twitter account? It’s Du Bois, not DeBois (duh). Other Twitter users called out how insensitive this administration has acted during Black History Month. Black History Month tally: Trump resurrected Fred Douglass, Pence turned Lincoln black, Devos turned DuBois into a typo. With 16 days left. \n— jelani cobb (@jelani9) February 12, 2017 #BlackHistoryMonth for the GOP so far \nNo clue who Frederick Douglass is Misspells W. E.

Shun… uh, I’m sorry, Education, they tweeted out an apology for the misspelling that was also misspelled. Twitter Giphy \nWhile this followup apology tweet has since been deleted, as of 2:20 pm PST on February 12, the original tweet with Du Bois’ misspelled name was still up on the Twitter account in addition to a tweet that had his correctly spelled name. \nYou might be able to say Trump is creating jobs because this social media worker might be saying goodbye soon to their position at the Department of Education if they keep up their pace of typos. \nThen again, Trump’s tweets will sometimes have egregious spelling errors and typos, as well. What can I say? It’s 2017 and everything is awful. \nLet’s hope the Department of Education starts becoming a pillar of learning, rather than the gaffe-riddled government division it’s settled into. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:55:27.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
