Here’s your chance india Updated: Feb 18, 2017 16:24 IST Malavika Vyawahare Hindustan Times, New Delhi ISRO successfully launching a record 104 satellites, including India’s earth observation satellite on-board PSLV-C37/Cartosat2 Series from Sriharikota on Wednesday. If the agency’s successes have whetted your appetite for a career at an organisation where the sky is not the limit, the application is open till March 7.(PTI) \nOn February 15 when the Indian Space Research Organisation launched 104 satellites , it also offered India’s young engineers and scientists a chance to launch their careers with it. \nThe agency advertised 97 vacancies this week. It needs 42 people with degrees in electronics, 36 mechanical engineers and 9 with computer science backgrounds. If the agency’s successes have whetted your appetite for a career at an organisation where the sky is not the limit, the application is open till March 7. \nThe agency aims to take only the best and has stringent minimum requirements even to qualify to sit for the written test, which is the next step in the recruitment process. You don’t need an advanced degree to qualify but scoring a first class in the BE/ BTech is a must with an aggregate of at least 65 % or a CGPA 6.84/10. \nEven if you do meet the minimum requirements it is no guarantee that you will be called for the test. The recruiters shortlist applicants for the written test after perusing academic performance and the information provided in the online application. \nThere is a fee of Rs 100 for the application but women are exempted from paying the fee and so are physically challenged candidates and those from weaker sections. \nThe written test for these positions will be held in May at 12 centres across the country. To help applicants prepare for the multiple choice question paper, ISRO also provides previous years papers on its website. \nSample this: \n“Which of the following is true only for XML, but not for HTML? \n(a) It is derived from SGML \n(b) It describes content and layout \n(c) It allows user-defined tags \n(d) It is restricted only to be used with web browsers” \nThis is one of the questions put to computer science candidates during last year’s recruitment. \nThe scores for the written test help shortlist candidates for the interview stage but are not considered in the final selection. The last round is the interview stage. You have to score at least 60 % in the interview round to make it to ISRO. This is a merit list and top scorers are inducted. \nThe maximum age limit is 35 but that is relaxed for people with disabilities and former servicemen. \nThe positions come with a basic pay of Rs 56,100 per month, lots of perks and of course, huge respect. \nStudents who are completing their course this year need not worry, as long as they can furnish their final degree by end of August, they are eligible to apply.
