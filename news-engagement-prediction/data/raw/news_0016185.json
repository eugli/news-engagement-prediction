Image copyright Reuters \nApple's biggest manufacturing partner is Taiwanese giant Foxconn, which runs the biggest iPhone factory in the world in China. \nApple is currently unable to set up its own branded stores in India, which has a raft of rules to curb the activities of foreign companies. Rising sales \nFor it to be able to sell direct to customers in India, Apple would have to source 30% of the components of its products locally. \nEarlier this week, Apple reported its first rise in sales in nine months after strong Christmas sales of the iPhone 7. \nThe firm had suffered three quarters in a row of falling revenues as mounting competition, particularly from Chinese rivals, hit sales of the iPhone. Analysis: Shilpa Kannan, India business reporter, Delhi \nIndian media has been speculating about Apple for a while. The iPhone is much coveted as a status symbol in the country, but it's very expensive for most people. \nThey range from $194 for a 16GB version to the top end iPhone 7Plus which costs about $1,164. \nThe bulk of rival smartphones on the market in India cost about $100-$120. But the hope is that manufacturing locally will bring iPhone prices down. \nI spoke to Karnataka's information technology minister, Priyank Kharge, who said there was a fierce competition among Indian states to woo Apple to set up a manufacturing facility. \nAlthough Apple is officially saying only that it will invest heavily in India, he confirmed that the tech giant has declared an intention to first start assembling the phones there and then move on to manufacturing. \nAnd by getting Apple to set up in Karnataka, he hopes says it should help promote to region's ambition to become a location for high-end manufacturing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T15:34:23.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
