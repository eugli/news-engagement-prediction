La Monica @lamonicabuzz February 28, 2017: 8:39 AM ET America's top retailers in trouble Tar-jay is no longer in style. \nTarget missed the bullseye badly during the holidays, reporting earnings that were below forecasts. And the company's outlook for this year was much worse than expected, sending the stock down 13% in early trading. Shares are down 20% this year. \nThe terrible numbers from Target ( TGT ) are just another sign of how tough it is for traditional retailers to compete against the online juggernaut that is Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) . \n\"Our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores,\" said Brian Cornell, chairman and CEO of Target. \nTo Target's credit, the company has embraced e-commerce. Target said digital sales were up 34% from a year ago. \nThat's higher than Amazon's overall sales growth during the holidays and even outpaced the 29% jump in online revenue growth that Walmart ( WMT ) posted in the fourth quarter. \nThe problem is that online sales are not growing quickly enough to offset the sales declines in Target's physical stores. Target said overall revenue fell more than 4% from a year ago. \nPart of that was because of Target's decision to sell its in-store pharmacies to CVS ( CVS ) in late 2015. But revenue was down at Target even after factoring in the absence of pharmacy sales from the fourth quarter of 2016's results. \nRelated: Move over, Amazon: Here comes Walmart \nConsumers are increasingly shunning traditional retailers like Target and shopping online. Macy's ( M ) , Kohl's ( KSS ) , JCPenney ( JCP ) and Sears ( SHLD ) have also been hit hard by this shift in recent years. \nTarget seems to have been caught off guard by the magnitude of the change, though. The company had predicted a strong holiday quarter in November, but warned in January that its results would miss forecasts. \nThe numbers Target reported on Tuesday were even worse than what it forecast last month. \nThe company expects earnings for the first quarter and the full fiscal year will be lower than what Wall Street analysts were predicting. \nAnd Target said same-store sales, which measures the performance of stores open at least a year, will fall in the first quarter and for the full year. \nA decline in commodity prices has also led to problems in Target's grocery division. \nMany big supermarket chains like Kroger ( KR ) and Whole Foods ( WFM ) have warned that while lower food prices can be good news for consumers, they hurts profit margins for retailers. \nTarget said it plans to \"transition to a new financial model.\" The company is expected to provide Wall Street more details about the new strategy when management has a conference call with analysts later Tuesday morning. \nRelated: Here's why Amazon might buy a big retailer \nThe woes are the latest setback for a company hit by a massive data breach in 2013. The credit and debit cards of about 40 million customers were stolen. \nThe problems led to the ouster of longtime CEO Gregg Steinhafel. Cornell, formerly an executive at Pepsi ( PEP ) , took over in 2014 and had appeared to right the ship. Sales went back up. \nBut Cornell now faces another problem that might not be so easy to fix -- convincing consumers there's a reason to put their phones down and head back to the mall.
