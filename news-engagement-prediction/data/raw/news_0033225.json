White House press secretary Sean Spicer. Photo: AP \nSo was White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, when he yet again embarrassingly and very publicly fumbled the name of a world leader at his daily press briefing. \nThe previous day, the incredibly popular Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau held his first meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House, where the pair attended a round-table discussion about the advancement of women in business and held a working lunch.

Photo: Bloomberg \nEarlier this month, Spicer repeatedly mispronounced the Australian Prime Minister's name as \"Trunbull\" at a press briefing as he discussed a refugee deal between the two countries. \nThe following day, he repeated the error again , saying: \"We have a tremendous amount of respect for the people of Australia, for Prime Minister Trunbull.\" Days later, the Office of the Press Secretary then published a statement online referring to \"The President of Australia\" . \nWithin minutes of Spicer's latest gaffe, social media was awash with comments about his performance.
