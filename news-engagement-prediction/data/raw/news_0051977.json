Story continues below \nFrom 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., Kiezik found four photo enforced radar vehicles set up in school zones around the city. In order to give drivers a warning, he parked his car in front of the vehicles and waved a sign reading ‘slow down, photo enforcement ahead’. \nRELATED: ‘It’s so egregiously wrong’ Wise Up Winnipeg stands up to Bishop Grandin intersection \n“They’re targeting areas, school zones around Winnipeg, saying it’s a safety issue, but clearly it’s not,” Kiezik said. \nMost people driving by Kiezik honked their horn and gave a thumbs up before they passed the radar vehicles. \nOther WiseUp Winnipeg members were out on the streets Monday morning with signs to warn drivers. Shelden Rogers/Global News \nTwo other Wise Up members were on the streets with signs in different areas of the city in hopes of changing school zones on holidays. \n“I hope they can change the signs to say ‘excluding holidays’, or get someone high-end to ask, ‘why are they targeting school zones on days where there’s no children’,”Kiezik said. \nRELATED: New school zone rules will force city to put up more signs \nPhoto enforcement in school zones is common on holidays, said one officer in a photo radar vehicle in the Southdale area, who refused to go on camera. \nThe officer said although students are off of school for the day, there is still a chance the building could be occupied. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
