A police officer in the US has made good on a promise to a homeless man he spotted wearing little to protect him from the blistering cold. (Source: Facebook) \nThe generous police officer went home and was sure to pack a thick coat in his squad car for the homeless man. \nBut when he went to make his deliver, the man was nowhere to be seen. \nWeeks passed before Mr White noticed the man again, standing out in the cold. \nHe promptly jumped out of his squad car and assured the man he was not at risk of another fine. \n\"There will be no ticket today, just the jacket,\" he can be heard saying as he slips the coat over the man's shoulders. \nMr White's partner Bob Osborne filmed the exchange and uploaded the video to Facebook where the act of kindness did not go unnoticed. \n\"My partner Pete doing a good deed. We wrote this guy a ticket 3 weeks ago and he had a thin little jacket so Pete promised him that he would bring him his old coat. When we finally saw him again Pete gave him his coat. See Pete White you are not such a bad guy. CPD is the best!\" \nHundreds of people commended the officer for his generosity and the video was viewed by thousands.
