Pin \nAt Jabot, Michael enters Jack’s office, where Gloria is rubbing his shoulders. The pair act nonchalant, but Michael can’t pretend not to have seen what he saw. Jack rambles about a shoulder injury. Michael marvels that ‘magic fingers’ are a part of her secretarial duties. Glo exits and Michael turns to Jack. Noting Gloria and Jack’s mutual hatred, he rants it would have been less bizarre to see Victor Newman there taking dictation in a pencil skirt. “What are your intentions with my mother?” Jack mocks him. Michael accuses him of setting Glo up for reprisal. Jack insists he owed Gloria for helping him acquire Fenmore’s. After, Jack compliments Glo on how she handled herself. She wants to know what to call their ‘relationship’, and opines that they’re a team. Jack points out they need to be more discreet. Gloria wants more, career-wise. Jack realizes working ‘under’ him won’t satisfy her for long…at work. He promises she’ll see a ‘rapid rise’. Meanwhile, Phyllis arrives in Ravi’s office, where he reveals they have an enormous, horrible, awful problem. Panicked, Ravi rambles about traffic - the site is going to crash when they launch. Phyllis decides they’ll have to postpone. Talk turns to Phyllis’ frustration over how to help Lauren. Ravi shares a story about helping a heartbroken uncle when he was younger – they can help Lauren by preparing the launch. Phyllis agrees. They chat about Ashley disliking her and Ravi wishes everyone could drop the drama. Phyllis heads up to Jack’s office and arrives as Glo exits. Phyllis remarks on him hiring the woman and then lodges a complaint that Ashley constantly bad-mouthing her is upsetting Ravi. Jack mentions he’s over his issues with Phyllis, and she asks, “What’s her name? Do I know her?” She snaps about him embracing forgiveness and leaves. Back in Ravi’s office, Phyllis demands to know if he thinks she’s afraid to be alone. Ravi responds, “Isn’t everyone?” \nNew: Deconstructing Y&R! Solid daily dose of drama, but no intoxicating thrill \nPaul arrives at Lauren’s door with a trace on the call about Scott. She asks who has her son, and is frustrated to hear that all they know is it came from the Middle East. Paul works to calm her down. Lauren tearfully declares they’ll pay the ransom; they have no other choice. Paul thinks it would be a mistake. Dylan’s name comes up and Lauren says he turned his back on his family; her son is in danger, it’s not the same! They both apologize. Lauren asks what he’d do if it were Dylan. Paul runs down the calls they’ll make. Michael arrives to find Paul consoling Lauren. She tells him about the ransom demand, and debate ensues about options. Lauren feels they must pay the ransom and is prepared to sell everything. Paul is opposed – it could make things worse. Michael supports Lauren. \nMore: Dr. Phil hosts parents of a moocher \nReed lets Nikki into the house and she gives him some sheet music before raving about his fantastic performance at The Underground. Vikki appears and invites her son to explain how he pulled it off – on a school night at a bar. Reed heads upstairs, exasperated and muttering about being grounded. Nikki debates with Vikki about the situation. Victoria, thinking she’s dropping a bomb, reveals that Reed swiped her credit card and joined an online porn site. Nikki cracks up, but concedes he shouldn’t have used her card. She warns it could be worse and reminds Vikki of the time she posed naked. Vikki presumes her mother thinks she’s a hypocrite. Nikki denies it, but feels teens will do crazy things. Vikki thanks her, and Nikki goes. Vikki calls Reed down and they hold a civil conversation about him taking music lessons. In return for paying for them, Victoria wants Reed to play for her. She produces his guitar. Vikki beams as he plays his song.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:23:46.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
