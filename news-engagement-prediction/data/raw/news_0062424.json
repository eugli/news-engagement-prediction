The Ford GT Competition Series also uses Plexiglas over the engine and a thinner, lighter Gorilla Glass bulkhead to decrease the supercar’s curb weight of around 3,300 pounds. \nStandard on the Ford GT Competition Series are the carbon fiber wheels that are optional on the standard GT. The special model also gets titanium lug nuts and a titanium exhaust. In addition to the weight-reducing carbon fiber and Plexiglas bits, the Competition Series exposes the carbon fiber on the console, registers, and door sills. The paddle shifters and instrument panel have been anodized in red to bring a pop of color into the Ebony Alcantara suede seats, instrument panel, and headliner. \nThe Competition Series will be offered in six colors, including Shadow Black, Frozen White, Ingot Silver, Liquid Blue, Liquid Gray, and Triple Yellow. However, only the United States will get the Competition Series. Ford is remaining mum on how many Competition Series cars will be built; only stating that it will be offered throughout “all announced production years.” \n“The Ford GT has racing in its blood. The Competition Series was developed with the most hardcore track enthusiasts in mind, providing a tailored set of lightweight features and a unique livery to match,” said Raj Nair, Ford executive V.P., global product development, and chief technical officer, in a statement. \nFord GT production has already begun with the first few customer cars already trickling out . All slots, however, have already been accounted for, meaning you won’t be able to buy a new Ford GT anytime soon. \nSource: Ford", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:26:45.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
