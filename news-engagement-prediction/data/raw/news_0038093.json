Available for Linux and Windows , it lets you generate a random environment to train your bot or vehicle, experiment with various models and test in a range of scenarios right in your workshop. \nIt’s worth noting that the software isn’t designed to entirely replace real-world testing, but rather to complement it by allowing you to simulate a wide range of experiments on demand and as many times as necessary. \nIn addition to creating detailed environments that mimic the real world, AirSim also incorporates realistic physics systems to accurately simulate various lighting conditions and object clusters (such as a bunch of trees) to help train robotic models in understanding how to compute depth, avoid obstacles and deal with shadows and glare when navigating through outdoor spaces.
