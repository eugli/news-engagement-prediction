It was reported earlier this month that aides of Trump had contact with Russia during the election campaign. This was followed this week by reports that the White House tried to get the FBI to “knock down” those stories. \nOnly 25% of respondents think Congress doesn’t need to probe these potential contacts and 21% don’t have an opinion. When broken down along partisan lines, only a quarter of Republicans want an investigation, compared to 55% of independents and 80% of Democrats. \nThe poll also asked whether or not Congress should hold investigations into Russian interference in the presidential election. The intelligence community has already concluded that Russia did meddle in the election to assist Trump. \nThe survey found 54% of the public wants to see an investigation into this matter, with 29% stating that it does not need to be looked at by Congress. Just as with the Russian contact probe, it was split along partisan lines, as only 25% of GOPers wanted to see an investigation. Meanwhile, 51% of independents and 84% of Democrats want to see a Congressional probe. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:09:57.913+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
