But in recent months, as the Mail’s Take Back Your Bottles campaign has fuelled the debate — and attracted the support of Prince Charles, anti-litter campaigners and wildlife and environmental groups — the drinks industry and supermarkets mobilised to thwart it (as, ironically, leaked documents from Coca-Cola revealed last month). They insisted such schemes won’t work, are too expensive to run and mean price hikes for shoppers. Yet the evidence completely refutes this. The success stories in other countries make clear how easy a DRS is to run — and that British ministers’ seeming refusal to introduce one is a shameful betrayal. Take the German scheme, known as the Pfand. The price of every single-use plastic or glass drinks bottle and aluminium can between 10ml and 3 litres sold includes a 25 cent (22p) deposit (excluding milk, fruit juice, baby products, wine and spirits). The Mail’s Take Back Your Bottles has attracted the support of Prince Charles When people return their empties, they get the deposit back. And if they don’t — if they throw the bottle from a car or drop it in a rubbish bin — you can be sure some enterprising teenager will pick it up and collect the reward. The scheme has been so successful that by 2011, 98.5 per cent of plastic bottles were being recycled each year. In the UK we recycle just 57 per cent, despite a Government target of 75 per cent. A typical British household gets through 480 of them every year. Only 270 of these are recycled; the rest — some 16 million in total — are dumped.It takes 500 years for a plastic bottle to break down. Many end up in the sea, becoming a threat to marine life. A large number of German stores collect single-use glass and plastic bottles using ‘reverse vending machines’. People push their empties into a slot and receive a voucher to be exchanged for cash or used in store. Anti-litter groups estimate 2 billion are returned annually. Responsibility for the machines is shared by retailers and the drinks industry. Owners of vending machines must ensure there is a ‘reverse vending machine’ near by. Shops can sell the bottles to recycling centres or send them back to the manufacturers. Proceeds from selling the empties to recycling plants are usually shared between retailers and manufacturers. It’s not just single-use plastic and glass bottles that have a price on them in Germany. The Pfand scheme runs alongside a voluntary system to deal with reusable glass and plastic bottles, which are returned to manufacturers to be washed, sterilised and refilled. This deposit is 8 cents (7p) for beer bottles, 15 cents (13p) for other drinks. Nikolai Fichtner, of the German Environment Ministry, says it has dramatically cut litter. ‘You see it on the streets, there are no cans or bottles anywhere.’ Introducing the Pfand wasn’t plain sailing. The drinks and retail industry fought hard, launching lawsuits against the government. The industry also received unlikely support from Brussels, where the European Commission declared the scheme ‘hindered free movement of goods’. Nikolai Fichtner, of the German Environment Ministry, says it has dramatically cut litter. ‘You see it on the streets, there are no cans or bottles anywhere' Eventually, the EC backed down and the government won the legal wrangles. Industry fears proved unfounded, and prices have risen by just 1 per cent. And there is no evidence drinks companies have lost sales. Germany’s scheme may be the most effective in the world, but there are plenty of others. Indeed, across Europe and beyond, about 150 million people use a DRS. Cans carry a 6 cent deposit and bottles 25 cents in Sweden. Recycling is at around 85 per cent. In Norway it is 96 per cent. There are also schemes in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hun- gary, Lithuania, Israel, and Australia. In Canada, plastic water bottles are the third most recycled product. In Ontario, a province of almost 14 million people, plastic drinks containers account for less than one-fifth of 1 per cent of waste. Polls suggest that in countries with a DRS, 80 to 90 per cent of people support them. It would be no different in Britain — if only ministers see sense, take action and persuade the drinks industry and supermarkets to slow the tide of plastic that threatens to engulf us.
