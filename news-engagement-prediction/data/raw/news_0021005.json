This week it was reported that Oprah Winfrey sold one to a Chinese buyer last year that she first purchased in 2006. \nWinfrey bought Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II for $87.9m (£70m) at Christie’s in New York, setting an auction record for the artist. She sold it in a private deal for $150m. That amounts to one painting for almost half the cost of Tate Modern’s extension, which opened last year. \nKlimt is one of the ten artists whose works have fetched in excess of $100m at auction, the others being Gauguin, Cezanne, Rothko, Picasso, Modigliani, Bacon, Giacometti, Pollock and De Kooning. \nNewman said she expected the new Klimt to cause a sensation in the art market. \n“Alongside Klimt’s portraits, his landscapes are a dazzling treatment of nature, imbued with his own aesthetic which is in tune with his golden period portraits such as The Kiss. \n“This painting has universal appeal, but certainly this aesthetic will appeal to Asian collectors as Klimt drew his influence from Asian art.” \nThe painting was last publicly exhibited last year at the Royal Academy of Arts’ Painting the Modern Garden show. \nIt will go up for sale in London on 1 March.
