I ran like 4-8 laps just to get the hang of it. I’m probably going to get back in a little bit later.” \nWhile known for his success in the open-wheel ranks, the Colombian is also a three-time Rolex 24 at Daytona overall race winner, having won in 2007, 2008 and 2013, all with Chip Ganassi Racing in Riley DPs. \n“A prototype drives more like an open-wheel car,” he said. “This is very different. \n“There’s a lot of pitch movement with the cars. It’s very easy to get it wrong. \n“You go in one time and it turns, the next time you go in, it doesn’t, the next time you go in, it gets loose. It’s very hard to be consistent.” \nWhile Risi team manager Dave Sims ruled out seeing Montoya in the car for next month’s Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring, the Formula One veteran could be back in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship sooner rather than later. \nMontoya, who remains under contract with Team Penske, has been linked as one of the drivers for the team’s planned DPi venture, rumored to be with Honda, that is expected to debut next year. \nWhen asked about a full-time switch to sports cars, Montoya said “time will tell.” \n“I would think so but we’ll see. We’ll see when and what,” he said. \nMontoya’s only planned race this year is the Indianapolis 500, in a one-off run in a fifth Penske entry.
