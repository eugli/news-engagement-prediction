A smaller number of supporters waived signs of admiration. \nAnti-trump protesters along Southern Blvd. as President Trump's motorcade make its way to Palm Beach International Airport.

(Carline Jean/Staff Photographer) Protesters wore signs on their backs displaying the number 45 crossed out to demonstrate opposition to Trump, the 45th president. \n“Today being President’s Day, we thought the number was particularly symbolic,” said Star Fae, 28, founder of South Florida Activism. \nIt’s the responsibility of voters and taxpayers to ensure the president’s policies are reflective of their needs, Fae said.  \nAnti-trump protester, Marie Carianna, during a protest along Southern Blvd. in West Palm Beach.

(Carline Jean/Staff Photographer) Demonstrators stood on both sides of the street chanting, playing music and waving signs with slogans including “Trump’s words = fake news,” and “You tweet, we march.”\nGreg Nolin, a Trump supporter who was passing through the area, said he doesn’t mind the demonstrations as long as they remain peaceful.\n“They’re allowed to do it, but I’m going to say my opinion too,” he said, adding as he drove away, “It’s a beautiful day for a protest.”\nSupporters waived signs saying “Trump 2020” and “Welcome home President Trump #MAGA.”\nTrump left shortly after naming General H.R. McMaster as his National Security Advisor to replace retired Gen. Michael Flynn who resigned last week. \nIn other cities around the country, thousands of protesters held demonstrations against the president dubbed Not My President's Day.
