She has also previously painted her face green and yellow. Today admin worker Ms Porter said that wasn't the first time she had seen the clown - who had a 'vacant expression' on her face. Judith, who lives with partner George Phillips, 48, in Worcester, added: 'I was enjoying a nice stroll with my dog Bobby when I was shocked by the sight of a naked clown. A shocked passerby managed to take a picture of the unusual scene as she walked her dog at around 9am on Sunday 'This isn't the first time I have seen this clown, she appears on the odd Sunday mornings. 'The sightings disturb my usual walk along the scenic bridge in Worcester. The clown in this instance walks across the bridge and seemed to be walking to the Cathedral only then to turn around. 'The clown seemed to have a vacant expression and said nothing. 'I wonder if other people have also spotted the clown and why she has not been arrested. The blonde haired woman in the photo was as shocked as I was.' Judith's partner George, who works as an IT consultant, added: 'We are quite concerned about it. 'We are not religious at all but it does seem odd that this only occurs on Sunday mornings. We just feel it is not appropriate at all for someone to do this. 'Whether it is a joke linked to the clown craze from last year or something more sinister, whoever it is needs to stop.' Other residents took to social media to express their dismay at the unusual sighting in their city. Felicity Johnstone said: 'I hate clowns and this would frighten the living daylights out of me if I saw her on my morning jog. 'It chills me to the bone just looking at these pictures.' Andy Morris added: 'There could have been children walking around at that time and this could scar them for life. Utterly terrifying.' But James Chesterfield wrote: 'She's not doing anybody any harm. Good on her. This is what makes Worcester such an interesting place.' A spokeswoman for West Mercia Police said no incidents relating to the naked woman clown had been reported to them.
