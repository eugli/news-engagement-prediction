They were held to zero points against the Falcons, which extends one of the most bizarre streaks in NFL history. \nThe last time the Patriots scored a point in the first quarter of a Super Bowl was in 1997 against the Green Bay Packers. That was when Drew Bledsoe was at quarterback and Bill Parcells was the head coach. Tom Brady has still NEVER scored a point in the first quarter of a Super Bowl. 0 for 7 \n— Dr Cork Gaines (@CorkGaines) February 6, 2017 \nIn the Bill Belichick-Tom Brady era, the Patriots have never scored in the first quarter of a Super Bowl. That’s absolutely incredible. \nWhat’s even more odd is that the Falcons and Patriots ranked first and second in first-quarter scoring this season. Yet they finished with zero points in the first quarter of Super Bowl LI.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:01:47.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
