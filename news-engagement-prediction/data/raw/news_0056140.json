Mukesh Ambani, CMD, Reliance Industries \nStock market analysts are upbeat about the company's stock prospects in the near to medium term after Mukesh Ambani on Tuesday in an announcement stated that Reliance Jio, the company's telecom arm, will end its free services on 31 March, and would start charging customers beginning 1 April. \n\"The company's decision to start charging customers from 1 April has led to clarity in the sector, which was missing for some time. There were earlier concerns that RIL may extend its free services to customers for 4-6 months to acquire customers. However, the decision to end will mean cash will flow to the company after having spent a huge capex on it for last 7-8 years,\" said AK Prabhakar, head of research, IDBI Capital Markets Services Ltd. \nAnnouncing the tariff plans yesterday, Ambani unveiled Jio Prime service that will be opened for registrations between 1 March and 31 March. Customers can avail this at a joining fee of Rs 99 and Rs 303 monthly charges. This works out to Rs 10 per day. Also, all domestic voice calls to any network will remain free, with no roaming charges and unlimited data. \nThe existing subscribers who opt for Jio Prime will continue to get the Jio New Year offer benefits for one more year until 31 March 2018. \n\"We are grateful to everyone who believe in us,\" Ambani said announcing the plan. \nHe also said more value plans will be announced for Jio Prime members soon and details will be on My Jio app. \n\"With 10 crore customers under its belt, even a minimum tariff plan will translate into huge revenue earnings for the company to start with. Within a short period of time, Reliance Jio has reached economies of scale,\" said Prabhakar. \nIDBI Capital Market has set the target of Rs 1,219 for Reliance Industries, and indicated that the target price could be raised sooner. \nWith consolidation in the telecom space gaining momentum, pricing power will soon return for the top telecom players as the recent spate of merger announcements and proposals would lead to three or four big players in the sector in next few years, said Prabhakar. #52-week high #Mukesh ambani #Newstracker #Reliance industries #Reliance jio #Ril stock #Tariff plan Also See ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:40:16.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
