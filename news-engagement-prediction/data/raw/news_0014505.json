(AFP/AFP/Getty Images)  28 PM \nThe “secret” target of the President Trump-ordered raid in Yemen was an Al Qaeda leader considered the third most dangerous terrorist in the world, according to a report. \nFourteen Al Qaeda fighters and civilians were killed in the operation, though terrorist leader Qassim al-Rimi was not, multiple sources told NBC News . \nAl-Rimi has long been senior commander for the group’s faction in Yemen, and the U.S. State Department currently offers $5 million for information that brings the 38-year-old to justice. \nHe was heard in audio released over the weekend criticizing Trump as the “White House’s new fool,” though the authenticity of the recording could not be verified. \nYemeni brothers reunite with father after Trump travel ban \nThe raid, which resulted in the death of Navy SEAL William Owens, was said to have been planned during the Obama administration. \nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that it was “a successful operation by all standards,” but that it is hard to call it a complete success because Owens was killed. Navy SEAL William \"Ryan\" Owens died in the operation. (Department of Defense) \nIt was not sure how the operation’s target, al-Rimi, managed to avoid being killed or captured, and it is not clear if he was at the camp when the SEALs arrived. \nCommandos knew that their mission was “somehow compromised” as they were starting out, the New York Times reported last week. \nMilitary posts old video from Yemen raid, then takes it down \nOwens was the first casualty of the Trump presidency, and the President flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to meet his remains as they came home last week. \nAmong those believed killed beyond the 14 Al Qaeda fighters was Nawar al-Awlaki, the 8-year-old American daughter of al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike in 2011.
