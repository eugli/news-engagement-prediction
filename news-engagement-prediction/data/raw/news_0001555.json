The safety and security of the people are a priority,” he said. \nAs soon as Selva Kumar arrives, police will record his statement. \nThey will also be asking the Canadian authorities for his criminal record. \nKhalid added that he welcomed the move by the Government to set up a registry of sex offenders. \nSelva Kumar had unsuccessfully tried to block another newspaper, the Toronto Star , from publishing details of his parole hearing in June last year and photo, arguing that it would be dangerous for him. \nHe had claimed that he would be a victim of discrimination in Malaysia because he was Jewish. \nToronto Star had argued that it was important for his victims to know the details of his case and what he looked like now. \nIt had also quoted one victim as saying: “I believe the Malaysian public should be fully aware. Every border should have his picture.” \nThe felon was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting dozens of women in the late 1980s and early 1990s while posing as a modelling agent, movie producer or professional dancer. \nParole authorities had reportedly refused to let him out early because they feared that he would commit new offences. \nHe came to Canada as a student in 1980 and his visa was extended after he was sponsored by a spouse, Toronto Sun reported. \nIt also reported that Toronto policeman Brian Thomson, now retired, and his partner Peter Duggan had investigated and arrested Selva Kumar. \n“As long as he’s behind bars, the public has no concerns for their safety,” Thomson was quoted in the report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:11:07.961+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
