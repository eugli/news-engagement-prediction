with 12 points and two rebounds — shooting 6-for-9 from the field, with no three-point attempts — in the Utah Jazz’s 111-88 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. The young point guard’s night was highlighted by a poster jam on top of Noah Vonleh; awakening the Vivint Smart Home Arena crowd. \n“I’ve been working on a lot; jumping off one foot, definitely,” Exum said after the game. \n“My left leg, it’s been a real focus. I’m a two-foot jumper, but I was just being aggressive. I was up there, so I just tried it. \n“(The dunk) felt good. I had to look back to see if it went in, but it feels good.” \nWATCH EXUM’S POSTER JAM IN THE VIDEO PLAYER ABOVE! Exum gets up for the layup. Source: AP \nHis fellow Australian, Joe Ingles , posted an efficient 18 points of his own, shooting 7-for-9 from the field and 4-for-6 from beyond the arc. The Boomers wing also had four rebounds, four assists, and four steals in the game. \nIn other positive news, Andrew Bogut returned from injury, after missing eight games with a right hamstring strain. The big-man finished with four points and eight rebounds in the Dallas Mavericks’ 98-91 loss to the Detroit Pistons. \nIn the same game, Aron Baynes was effective for Detroit, posting two points and 11 rebounds in the win. \nPatty Mills finished with 13 points and six assists in the San Antonio Spurs’ 107-79 blowout win over the Orlando Magic. \nBoth Australians, Matthew Dellavedova and Thon Maker , earned the start in the Milwaukee Bucks’ 129-125 win over the Brooklyn Nets. Dellavedova finished with 10 points and five assists in 32 minutes of action, while Maker played just 14 minutes, posting four points and four rebounds. \nPODCAST!

He scored 13 in the quarter. \nJoe Ingles scored 18 for the Jazz, and Rudy Gobert had 13 points and 12 rebounds. \nMINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES 112 — DENVER NUGGETS 99 \nAndrew Wiggins scored 40 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 24 points and 18 rebounds in the Minnesota Timberwolves’ 112-99 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Wednesday night. \nWiggins’ second 40-plus game in 24 hours helped the Timberwolves split the season series with the Nuggets, whom they’re chasing for the eighth playoff spot in the West. \nBefore tip-off, Timberwolves coach Tom Thibodeau spoke about the danger of checking out mentally before the final game leading up to the All-Star break. He suggested focus was paramount in a game like this because “mentally if you go on the break before the break comes, it’s a problem.” \nIt wasn’t for Minnesota, which bounced back nicely from a 116-108 loss to LeBron James and the Cavs on Tuesday night when Wiggins scored 41.

The Magic sent Ibaka to Toronto for Ross and a first-round draft pick on Tuesday. \nWithout the personnel to match up against San Antonio (43-13), the Magic were in trouble. Even without injured big man Pau Gasol, the Spurs found mismatches all night and won their second straight heading into the All-Star break. \nAll three of San Antonio’s frontcourt starters scored in double figures. Dewayne Dedmon had 10 points and 11 rebounds. \nINDIANA PACERS 104 — CLEVELAND CAVALIERS 113 \nLeBron James scored 31 points, Kyrie Irving added 26, Kyle Korver made six 3-pointers and the Cleveland Cavaliers rolled into the All-Star break with their seventh win in eight games, beating the Indiana Pacers 113-104 on Wednesday night. \nIrving and Korver combined to make four 3s in the first 2:50 of the fourth quarter -- Korver finished with 22 points and became the seventh player with 2,000 career 3s -- as the NBA champions pulled away and improved to 7-1 in February following a drama-and-distraction filled January. \nAnd while most of the Cavs will relax over the weekend, James and Irving are headed to New Orleans for Sunday’s All-Star game. \nGlenn Robinson III scored 17 for Indiana, which lost its fifth straight. Pacers All-Star Paul George scored just 13 and missed 12 straight shots after the first quarter. George ended his drought by making a 3-pointer with 5:15 left. \nPHILADELPHIA 76ERS 108 — BOSTON CELTICS 116 \nIsaiah Thomas scored 13 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter and the surging Boston Celtics held on to beat the Philadelphia 76ers 116-108 on Wednesday night. \nIt was the 40th straight 20-point game for Thomas, tying the team record set by John Havlicek during the 1971-72 season. Marcus Smart added 21 points and eight steals for the Celtics. \nBoston has won four in a row and 11 of 12. Philadelphia’s loss ended its three-game winning streak. \nThe Celtics won despite committing a season-high 24 turnovers, though they needed a late run to preserve the victory. \nDario Saric led the 76ers with 20 points and 11 rebounds. Robert Covington added 18 points but left late in the fourth quarter after crashing into the Boston bench while diving for a loose ball. Boston Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas.

After Delon Wright’s layup made it a five-point game, Nicolas Batum hit a 3 for Charlotte to pull the Hornets within two, but DeMarre Carroll responded with a 3 of his own with 7.4 seconds to go to ice it and help the Raptors end a three-game losing streak. \nNorman Powell had 17 points and Jonas Valanciunas had 10 points and 11 rebounds as the Raptors won for just the fifth time in the past 16 games. \nFrank Kaminsky had a game-high 27 points, and Kemba Walker added 24 points and nine assists for Charlotte, which dropped its fourth straight and 11th consecutive road game. \nMILWAUKEE BUCKS 129 — BROOKLYN NETS 125 \nGiannis Antetokounmpo scored 33 points in his final game before making his All-Star debut, Greg Monroe added 25 and the Milwaukee Bucks sent the Brooklyn Nets to the break on a 14-game skid with a 129-125 victory Wednesday night. \nKhris Middleton finished with 20 points in his strongest game since returning from a ruptured left hamstring that forced him to miss the first 50 games. He made four free throws in the final 19 seconds as the Bucks won their third straight. \nMonroe was 12 for 16 from the field after going 12 for 15 on Monday in a victory over Detroit. He has two straight 20-point games after just one previously this season. \nBrook Lopez scored a season-high 36 points for the Nets. They have lost 16 straight at home. \nDALLAS MAVERICKS 91 — DETROIT PISTONS 98 \nReggie Jackson scored 22 points, Jon Leuer added 20 and the Detroit Pistons beat the Dallas Mavericks 98-91 Wednesday night. \nKentavious Caldwell-Pope had 16 points, Tobias Harris 13 and Ish Smith 10 for the Pistons, who led by 27 points at halftime before holding on for the win. Detroit outrebounded Dallas 56-36, led by Marcus Morris’ 13, Andre Drummond’s 11 and Aron Baynes’ 11. \nDirk Nowitzki had 13 of his 24 points in the third quarter to help the Mavericks rally. Dallas pulled within eight early in the fourth. Nowitzki also had 10 rebounds. Harrison Barnes added 16 points, Seth Curry had 13 and Deron Williams 12. \nMIAMI HEAT 117 — HOUSTON ROCKETS 109 \nHassan Whiteside had 23 points, 14 rebounds and five blocks to help the Miami Heat beat the Houston Rockets 117-109 on Wednesday night. \nDion Waiters added 23 points, nine rebounds and seven assists, and Goran Dragic had 21 points for the Heat, who ended a two-game skid that followed a 13-game win streak. Miami got back to winning by defeating the same team where that long winning streak started Jan. 17. \nJames Harden had 38 points 12 rebounds and 12 assists for his 15th triple-double of the season to lead the Rockets, who lost for the second time in seven games. \nMiami shot 13 for 35 on 3-pointers, while Houston was 13 for 40.

But they had to stem a fourth-quarter rally that pulled the Grizzlies to 92-91 on Vince Carter’s 3-pointer with 48.5 seconds left. \nDavis then connected on a 23-foot jumper, and the Pelicans hung on for their third victory in four games. Mike Conley’s 3-point attempt with 4.8 seconds remaining was short, ending Memphis’ final hope. \nJrue Holiday had 19 points and seven assists for New Orleans, which snapped a seven-game losing streak to the Grizzlies. Alexis Ajinca added 12 points and a season-high 10 rebounds. \nLOS ANGELES LAKERS 101 — PHOENIX SUNS 137 \nEric Bledsoe had his third career triple-double, the first for a Phoenix player since November 2015, and Devin Booker scored 23 points to lead the Suns over the Los Angeles Lakers 137-101 on Wednesday night. \nBledsoe got his 10th rebound with 6:06 to go and exited shortly after, finishing with 25 points and a season high-tying 13 assists. \nMarquese Chriss added 15 points and eight rebounds for Phoenix, with all four of his baskets on dunks. Alex Len came off the bench to contribute 15 points and nine boards. \nThe Suns led 102-76 after three quarters and coasted to their second victory in seven games and 11th straight over the Lakers at home. \nLou Williams and D’Angelo Russell led Los Angeles with 21 points apiece. The Lakers have lost three of four. \nNEW YORK KNICKS 105 — OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER 116 \nRussell Westbrook scored 38 points and posted his 27th triple-double of the season to help the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the New York Knicks 116-105 on Wednesday night. \nWestbrook moved into sole possession of third place for the most triple-doubles in a season, behind Oscar Robertson’s 41 in 1961-62 and Wilt Chamberlain’s 31 in 1967-68. The star guard had 14 rebounds and 12 assists in the 64th triple-double of his career. \nVictor Oladipo scored 21 points and Jerami Grant added 13 for the Thunder, who snapped a two-game skid. \nCarmelo Anthony had 30 points for the Knicks after being selected to the All-Star Game as an injury replacement for Kevin Love earlier in the night.
