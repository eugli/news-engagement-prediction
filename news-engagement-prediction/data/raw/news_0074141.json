PUBLISHED: 17:31, Thu, Feb 23, 2017 | UPDATED: 17:46, Thu, Feb 23, 2017 \nA self-styled earthquake predictor is warning of a magnitude eight or higher quake hitting the planet in just nine days on March 4. \n‘Quake mystic’ Frank Hoogerbeets has issued an online \"major earthquake warning\" amid fears a \"big one\" is on its way. \nMr Hoogerbeets, who is based in the Netherlands, uses a non-scientifically recognised way of predicting earthquakes based on planetary alignments with Earth. \nHe wrote on his website ditrianum.org: \"In the last week of February and the first week of March there will likely be a significant increase in seismic activity with the highest probability of an eight plus magnitude earthquake around March 4.\" \nMr Hoogerbeets claims the positions of the planets and the moon have an impact on tectonic plate movement here on earth. \nHe added: \"The anticipated seismic increase starting around February 24 will contrast sharply with only a few planetary alignments from the last week of January to the third week of February.\" YouTube Major earthquakes could strike over the next two weeks. according to Frank Hoogerbeets.
