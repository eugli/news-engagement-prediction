At one point, the little girl shows her mom a depiction of the American flag, scrapped together by various materials the child had picked up along their journey.\nAs the mother and daughter make their trek to a new life, construction workers are seen building a wall with a giant door. The two then arrive at the structure, visibly saddened they can’t get across. But a glimmer of sunlight peaks through, and the wary mother and girl realize all hope is not lost.\nThe unedited ad then shows a moving pick-up truck hauling lumber along a developed highway as the phrase “The will to succeed is always welcome here” flashes across the screen.\nThe ad came as President Donald Trump has proposed building a wall between the U.S. and Mexico and “making Mexico pay for it,” a line often repeated throughout the presidential campaign and that has continued into his administration. Trump issued an executive order on one of his first days in office instructing federal departments and agencies to get to work on plans to build the 2,000-mile structure.\n“We’re still working through everything. There hasn’t been any sort of conclusion of what can and can’t go in,” Steve Radick, vice president of public relations and content integration at the Pittsburgh-based public relations firm Brunner said in January, according to Campaign , a communications news website.\nAmy Smiley, director of marketing at 84 Lumber, added: “We’ve got a great story to tell about our company in our 90 seconds and are exploring many different ways to do that. Smiley said 84 worked with both Brunner and Fox to “take advantage of all the platforms we have available” to tell the full, unedited story.\nFor the version that aired Sunday, 84 Lumber ended up having to editing out the part that showed the wall. The aired version also did not include the construction workers building the wall or any sight of the wall at all, much less the mother and daughter walking through the door.\nAt its conclusion, the aired ad instructed viewers to “see the conclusion at Journey84.com.”\nPart one of the 84 Lumber Super Bowl commercial.

And I’ve always preferred to be the one doing the disrupting, rather than the one being disrupted,” Maggie Hardy Magerko, owner and president of 84 Lumber, said in January, according to Campaign.\nHardy Magerko added: “But to do that, we need to hire and train people differently. We need to cast a wider net, and to let the world know that 84 Lumber is a place for people who don’t always fit nicely into a box. We want people interested in creating their own path … for themselves and for 84 Lumber.”\n\nThe ad was one of a number of politically charged commercials that aired during the most-watched game of the year. Other companies that ran ads containing political messages included Anheuser-Busch, AirBnb, Google and Audi, the Washington Post reported .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:50:52.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
