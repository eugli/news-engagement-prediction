(AIST: Eijiro Miyak) \nDr Hogendoorn said there was a dire need for sustainable solutions. \n\"If the bees are struggling, how can we make them survive while still being productive in agriculture?\" she said. \nBut Australian Honey Bee Industry Council executive director Trevor Weatherhead is sceptical about whether robot pollinators can be used at a commercial scale. \n\"This little machine will certainly pollinate, but how many would you need for, say, 1,000 acres?,\" he said. Audio: Listen to Imogen Brennan's full story (The World Today) \n\"The other thing, for instance, you take macadamias or avocados where the flowers are on trees, the bees actually have to get in amongst the leaves to do the pollination. \n\"You have your pumpkins and watermelons where the flowers are in under the leaves themselves, and the bees sort of fly in under — I'm not sure how the robots would be able to get in and out.\" \nHe said it is not the first time his industry has faced similar problems. \n\"There are certainly problems and we're encountering them all the time,\" Mr Weatherhead said. \n\"For instance, you take your varroa mite, it's out there [but] Australia doesn't have it and we don't want it. \n\"When it comes here it will certainly have an effect, but beekeepers finally adapt to it with pesticides — we sort of keep pushing and pushing for the safe application of pesticides.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:40:03.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
