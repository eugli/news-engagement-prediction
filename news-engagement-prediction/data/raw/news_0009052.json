And my mind went through whom I could contact to get the inside story to the “recalcitrant” lion dance performer. \nTan Keng Liang!” I thought. \n“This is an off-the-record question. What happened to the lion? Why it didn’t dance?” \nThat’s because the lion was peeling a pomelo and oranges to be presented to PM,” said the exasperated politician. \n’s answer and pasted it on my WhatsApp groups where the clip was posted. That shut up some of those who were gleeful that a lion dance performer had defied the Prime Minister. \nSome, however, still didn’t want to believe, arguing the lion dancer was not peeling pomelo and oranges as the ears of the “lion” were not moving. \nSince I was not the argumentative type and also it was tiresome to argue with zombies, I replied: “Up to you to believe what you want to believe.” \nFor some, it was a case of seeing is believing. They argued that the video clip clearly showed the lion dance performer refusing to dance for Najib. \n“lion”. \n’s Facebook page. Her posting had attracted many negative comments on the matter. \nWhy does such a misleading clip exist?” I asked Tan, who is a rather controversial figure on Twitter. \nIt’s normal for the Opposition to try to mislead the public and create a false perception of the Govern­ment,” said the Twitter sensation circa 2012. \n’t politicise a Chinese New celebration. \nI feel sorry that the lion dance troupe has been victimised for the Opposition’s political agenda. The troupe had done a fantastic performance and was even praised by the PM on his FB page,” he said. \nYou have explained that the video clip was misleading. Do you think those who believed the ‘lion’ didn’t want to dance for the PM now believe what they earlier believed is not true?” I asked. \nThe full video of the actual dance performance really helped to debunk the spin and lies created by the Opposition,” he said. \nBut there are still some who refused to believe. Not many. But a few. Just like some who still believe that 40,000 Bangladeshis voted in the last general election.” \nIt is the age of fake news. Do you agree that both sides – Barisan Nasional and Opposition are involved in creating fake news?” I asked. \n“There’s a market for fake news. There are some people who like to believe what they like to hear and see. The truth is irrelevant to them. Some even use FB as their source of news without verifying the source,” he said. \nGerakan, Tan said, doesn’t believe in spreading lies as the public would find out the truth in due time. \n“Your credibility would be at stake once the lie is exposed. Just like what happened when the full video of the lion dance was released,” he said. \nI asked him: “How about BN, the Opposition too has accused it of manufacturing fake news?” \n“BN supporters should also not follow the footsteps of the Opposition. But if there’s such an incident, then the Opposition should bring out evidence to disprove it,” he said. \n“Stern action would be taken against anyone in BN for spreading the fake news. I hope the Opposition would also do the same.” \nHe added: “However, the Oppo­sition leaders seem to be silent over the lion dance hoax.” \n“What’s your advice to those who believe in fake news?” I asked. \n“It would be best to verify the source of the news. I would normally check to see whether other news agencies published the same thing,” he said. \n“Don’t simply believe in whatever is spread on social media and messaging apps. Best to wait a while and not rush to any conclusions.” \nWith the possibility of GE14 this year, the Year of the Rooster could be the year of Malaysians believing in “alternative facts”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:42:26.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
