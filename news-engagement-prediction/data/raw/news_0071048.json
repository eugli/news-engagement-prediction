Over the past three years, he has impressed with his act in films like Haider and Udta Punjab . He has won several awards for these two films too, but his last three films haven’t managed to earn big bucks at the box office. While his colleagues are taking their films past the Rs 100 crore mark, Shahid has not been able to do that. In an industry driven by box office collections, Sasha needs to deliver hits on a regular basis to be a bankable star. With Rangoon all set to release, trade expert, Akshaye Rathi (exhibitor and distributor) analyses how important Rangoon is for the actor… \nTalking about Shahid’s last three releases, Akshaye opines, “ Haider was a critically acclaimed film, but not such a huge hit at the box office. Shaandaar was a disaster and commercially, Udta Punjab was nothing. On top of this, if you analyse the overall profits that his last three releases made, you will be shocked. When you add the profits and subtract the losses of his last three films, you’ll be shocked to know that Shahid’s films have made an overall profit of just Rs 14.55 crore. This is disastrous for the star.” ALSO READ – Shahid Kapoor’s secret presence on Snapchat will make you question if he even loves back his fans – watch videos \nAkshaye further explains, “If you look at the balance sheet of his last three releases, then there are more liabilities and unfortunately there are more losses than profits. That is extremely unfortunate for any actor. If the nett. collections from his last three releases is just Rs 14.55 crore more than their collective budgets, then it is disastrous. This is because the share that comes (to the makers) is just 50 per cent of the nett. collections, which is much lesser than the budget and it is a massive loss for the industry, not just him.” ALSO READ – Rangoon extended trailer: A sassy Kangana Ranaut, a striking Shahid Kapoor and a suave Saif Ali Khan make for a devastating love triangle \nA run of three dismal performances at the box office means that Shahid desperately needs a hit and Rangoon might give him just that. As Akshaye adds, “For any actor, it is necessary to have multiple hits to his or her credit. Fortunately there have been a lot of stars who have survived after delivering cold turkeys at the box office, purely because they had the talent to deliver hits and Shahid is versatile and has the charm and skill to deliver a great performance. All he needs to do now is to choose the right kind of films which will give him the chance to perform, while also contributing significantly to the box office collections that the film industry needs. Rangoon is of course important for Shahid, but I have no doubt that the film will fetch a lot of praise and acclaim.” \nAkshaye elaborates, “He needs to do a Padmavati once in a while to earn him a lot of money. That will enhance his stand at the box office. He doesn’t need to do more films which will prove his acting abilities as he has done that time and again and there is nobody who will question his talent. So it is time for him to focus on delivering returns at the box office and I hope he can do that.” \nIn today’s day and age, filmmakers look for an actor that can promise them box office returns rather than someone who can only perform well. Surprisingly the fact that Shahid hasn’t delivered a single Rs 100 crore film over the past few years is a worrying factor. This is why Rangoon is very important for the actor at this stage of his career. He needs to reinvent himself, get a couple of hits under his belt and choose better movies going forward. This would help him regain his position as a top box office star once again.

The film sees Shahid reunite with Vishal Bhardwaj, who has given him two hits already. This, along with the fact that Rangoon looks interesting, makes the situation very ideal for Shahid. And post Rangoon, he is working on a huge film like Padmavati too. So things are indeed looking bright for Shahid.
