Photo: Deborah Snow \nAsked if the US intelligence establishment was effectively at war with Mr Trump, Mr Morell said he felt the tensions would \"blow over\", especially after the resignation on Tuesday of Mr Trump's first pick as national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn stepped down over his private dealings with the Russian ambassador. \nMr Morrell said the President was a \"wild card' on foreign policy who did not have any deeply held ideology or policy views. \nHe described Mr Trump's foreign policy mindset as: \"If there is a direct threat to the US we will deal with it, other than that we should withdraw from the world and take care of our own problems.\" \nHe said Mr Trump was pulled between two poles, that of the traditional US national security establishment which saw Russia as an adversary; and the competing influence of Mr Trump's arch right wing adviser Steve Bannon, who saw Islam and China as the main enemy and Russia as a potential ally. \nHe encouraged US allies to \"be an influence to pull the US in the right direction\" and said that Australia's intelligence community should not alter close ties with their American counterparts because of the turbulence jolting the first weeks of President Trump's administration. \nMr Morell slammed Moscow again for its interference in the US election, repeating his claim that Mr Trump had become an unwitting agent for the Russians. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin, he said, was a former intelligence agent adept at \"identifying people's vulnerabilities\". \n\"What I still think I saw was Putin identifying the President's narcissism and ego and playing to it and knowing he would get a positive response [ from Trump] and he did.\" \nIn other remarks Mr Morell said: It was \" dangerous\" and \" highly inappropriate\" for Mr Trump's chief strategist, right-wing populist Steve Bannon, to be on the top committee of the National Security Council because \"you don't want politics to be influencing national security in any way\"; He did not believe that the National Security Agency was withholding information from President Trump for fear of security leaks, as some former Washington insiders have alleged; The Russians had created and amplified \"fake news\" during the US Presidential election campaign in a way that was probably even more effective at influencing the outcome of the election than the better-known hack of the Democrat campaign emails. \nAsked if Mr Trump would last four years as President, Mr Morell said he could not say, but that \"if there is to be an issue it will be an issue between the administration and the courts, it's going to be some constitutional crisis created by lack of respect, lack of restraint ... but I'm not sure I would bet on this, I just don't know.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:33:53.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
