When I came to Halley for my second winter, I decided it would be a good idea to have a personal project to see me through the winter - this was going to be something completely unrelated to my work, and I knew it would have to be related to photography. I've taken thousands of pictures during my first winter and I knew this place had a great photo potential. 'I wanted a more structured project, with a defined goal, and I also wanted to improve my skills as well as having a reason to get out every single day. I decided I'd be taking pictures every single day of 2016 - this is how Antarctica366 was born. I'm not aware of any other picture a day challenge having ever been done in Antarctica, which added to the reasons to do it. I was going to try to put a solid effort into every single one of the images, and to try to make them as interesting as possible. I also thought this would be a good way of documenting the daily life at Halley - even if the pictures only captured single short moments each day.' © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images The Sun setting behind the Waste Sledge at the Halley station, creating the Sun Pillar, as the last sunrays are reflecting in the ice crystals suspended in the air © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images This self-oortrait of Michal was taken after he had to visit the Clean Air Sector, where no vehicles are allowed at any time, and so each visit there must be on foot. After the 30 to 40 minute walk he ended up with a lot of frost on his face © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images This picture was taken at the Brunt Ice Shelf, which is to the South West of the Halley VI Station, where Precious Bay meets the Hinge Zone. In the picture, Mat, the Field Guide, is standing on the massive patch of hard blue ice, which looks like it may have been created as a meltpool © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images Michal witnessed his best show of the Southern Lights in May. The aurora suddenly intensified for about ten minutes or so, and patterns of brilliant green light, as well as some reds and yellows were changing rapidly all over the sky above his head © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images This picture shows two SnoCat tracked vehicles, buried in snow, with the twilight over the North horizon © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images The most iconic vehicle used at Halley is the Sno-Cat. It's primary use is as a people carrier and it can take up to 11 passengers including the driver, however they are also used to haul medium weight load - such as a single sledge with a small caboose, cargo from an aircraft or a Fassi crane © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images This is a two-man tent, made of Ventile (a very tightly woven cotton fabric). Once pitched, it can withstand heavy winds and provide safety and comfort for its occupants. The inside of the tent is lit up by the tilly lamp. Also, a stove and a pot of hot water can be seen in the middle © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images In the image the Emperor Penguins colony can be seen occupying a large portion of sea ice, with the cliff of the Brunt Ice Shelf visible in the background © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images This is one of two Adelie Penguins who paid a visit to the station. They spent quite a bit of time resting, sleeping and sun bathing in front of the modules, after which they went around the perimeter for a wander © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images This picture taken in July shows the brightest skies since the sun went down in May. The sun is still completely below the horizon, but the Michal managed to capture the amazing twilight that bathed the landscape © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images At the end of the Antarctic Summer Season most organisations either completely cease their operation or significantly scale down. One of those organisations is ALCI who provide logistics and air transport services for many bases. ALCI operate a number of aircraft, with the most iconic being the Basler Turbo BT-67 - a modernised version of the DC-3 and C-47 © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images Despite their remote location, the people of Halley still manage to enjoy a bit of recreational activity after work. In the picture, the Halley Chippy, Grant, is enjoying a kite boarding session under the full moon © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images A small team rests on top of a SnoCat after a couple of hours of manual digging to raise the Automatic Weather Station located at the coast of the Brunt Ice Shelf, at Windy Bay © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images This was one of the last shows of the Southern Lights over Halley before the night and darkness gave way to perpetual daylight. Pictured is the Nansen Sledge with the Halley VI modules in the background. The orange glow just above the horizon is the faint sun light. Also visible is the Milky Way, as well as the green and purple Aurora Australis © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images When Fridtjof Nansen planned his traverse of the Greenland icecap in late XIX century, he designed most of his equipment from scratch. One of the bits of kit he designed is the iconic Nansen sledge. The sledge is able to carry a load of up to 500kg, while coping with difficult and varied terrain: wind packed snow, ice, sastrugi or soft snow, as well as with cold temperatures © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images Throughout the winter the Halley team members participated in experiments run by the European Space Agency. Pictured is Halley Wintering Electrician Richard Inman executing the approach and docking to the ISS on a Soyuz spacecraft simulator © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images In addition to being used for moving fuel or waste to and from the station and for snow management, the Dozers are also a big help in pushing the snow into the melt tanks to produce water for cooking, drinking and washing © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images This picture was taken during a trip to the Brunt Ice Shelf to see the penguins. Michal said: 'Spending a day among the Emperor Penguins, on the sea ice, literally surrounded by them, is a magical experience' © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images CASLab is a Clean Air Sector Laboratory facility, which is located in a building situated about 1.5km from the main Modules, inside the Clean Air Sector. In and around the CASLab building is a suite of experiments focusing on the chemistry of the lowest parts of the atmosphere and interactions between the snow surface and the air © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images With the sky completely covered by a thick layer of cloud, everything around, including the main Halley modules, seem to be suspended in pure white nothing. The snow on the ground is completely indistinguishible from the sky above © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images Halley VI station at local apparent noon (also known as solar noon, which is when the Sun is at it's highest point) . This picture was taken in June when there was very little light left © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images In this image the POLAR 6 Basler is taking off at Halley en route back to Rothera Research Station, another British Antarctic Survey base on the Antarctic Peninsula, located at Rothera Point, Adelaide Island © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images The moon halo in the image has been caused by ice crystals carried by the wind. In the foreground the towers of the Comms Array can be seen, as well as the Satellite Dome which hosts the satellite dish providing the Internet link to the station. The Milky Way is also visible in the top right of the picture © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images One of the longest scientific data sets from Halley is the meteorological record. In the picture the Halley Doctor Greig Lawson is taking a temperature reading off of four thermometers installed in the Stevenson Screen. These will be entered into a database for comparison with the Automatic Weather Station's sensors © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images Halley VI Station at dusk. Michal said: 'It was a very quiet and still evening, with a moderate snow fall. Everything was covered with a thick layer of fresh powder and one could almost hear snowflakes hitting the ground' © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images This picture is a stitched panorama, made out of eight individual images. These have been taken from the edge of the ice shelf (just on top of the ramp leading off the ice shelf on the sea ice), and the ship is some 200m away. Each creek is an old chasm, which over the years slowly filled with snow, at the same time moving closer and closer to the edge of the ice shelf © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images Michal took this picture when he went on a co-pilot flight to Kohnen, a German research station located 750km due east of Halley. It is a bit of a tradition in Antarctica that the outgoing winterers, whenever possible, get a chance to go for a flight © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images This image shows vehicles under the stars, lit by a glow of light coming from the Halley Garage. The Milky Way can be seen above the North horizon © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images During the winter, all heavy towing is done with the help of one of the Dozers. Phil, the Halley Wintering Vehicle Mechanic, is doing a final check on the alignment of the tracks against the ramp before driving the dozer into the garage for a service © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images This image is a composite of two individual pictures - one exposed for the sky and one for the ground and the base; both images were then blended together in post.Visible in the image are the Halley Modules with the Milky Way overhead. In addition, a satellite trail can be seen crossing the Milky Way on its way towards the North Pole © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images There are several communication systems in place at Halley to keep the wintering team in touch with the outside world. The primary link is the VSAT (Satellite) connection via a hub in London to BAS Headquarters in Cambridge, and which provides the connectivity to the BAS Network and the Internet, as well as VoIP phones. The satellite dish is inside the dome visible to the left hand side of the image © Michal Krzysztofowicz/British Antarctic Survey/Cover Images This picture was taken on a windy evening, blowing at 30kt with gusts up to 35kt. The darkness outside and the blowing snow lit up by the spotlight create an eerie scene. With its exterior lights on, Halley station looks like a giant space ship that has landed on the ice shelf Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:45:37.193+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
