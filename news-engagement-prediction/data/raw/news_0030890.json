Among the latest is that Dutt's best friend, played by Vicky Kaushal, is an amalgamation of a few of his close friends, including BFF-turned-brother-in-law Kumar Gaurav.\nVicky, who is careful to speak in measured tones, tells hitlist, \"I can't say much, but the character is primarily based on his close friend who lives in the US. That friend has been with him [Dutt] through thick and thin. I have major prep lined up and it requires a lot of travelling.\"\n\nVicky Kaushal \nVicky's character is apparently like Sonam Kapoor's, who plays Dutt's love interest, and isn't based on anyone in particular. However, sources say since Dutt's best friend doesn't belong to the industry, the makers and cast members are not ready to divulge his identity.\n\nKumar Gaurav \nAsked if he intends to fly down to the US to meet the man, Vicky dodges the question, saying, \"I will do whatever it takes. I feel the need to give my all to this role because it is a fantastic script, which makes you laugh and cry at the same time. Who gets to work with Raju Hirani barely two years into the industry? This will sink in only after the first trial [screening]. Dutt is a rockstar and all-heart. The first film of his that I watched was Vaastav (1999). I haven't started shooting yet, but Raju sir and Ranbir have jammed a lot with Sanjay sir. He even gave the first clap. It's hard to believe one man has led this life.\"\nVicky calls Ranbir a \"cool, chilled-out chap\", adding he is an admirer of his talent.\n\"During workshops, I got to know him better. There is a star-like quality in him, but he has no starry airs. He is a great listener. As an actor, his homework is on-point. We bond well and spend a lot of time around each other. On set, he is focused yet easy going and does not let anything distract him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:34:47.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
