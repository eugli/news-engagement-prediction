See what dominated the periods of play in our talking points from Day 2 of the one-off Test between India and Bangladesh. \n\nMagnificent Kohli surpasses Sehwag, Bradman \n\nFour Test series, four double-hundreds and the new record of most runs in a home series for any batsman from any country. That is the kind of rich batting form India's captain Virat Kohli is in. \n\n\nOn Friday, day two of the one-off Test match between India and Bangladesh in Hyderabad, Kohli converted his overnight 111 into his fourth score of 200, making it the fourth series in a row that he has crossed the landmark. On the way to that double-century, the 28-year-old broke the record for most runs by a batsman in a home Test season, surpassing former team-mate Virender Sehwag 's mark of 1105 in 2004-05. He got out for 204 in the second session. \n\nDuring India's 2-1 win the West Indies last summer, he scored 200 in the first Test; against New Zealand at Indore, his 211 helped complete a 3-0 sweep; then in the fourth Test of the 4-0 win over England, Kohli stroked his way to an epic 235. And now comes this almost effortless innings. Previously, Don Bradman and Rahul Dravid had scored three double hundreds in three successive Test series. \n\nComeback ton for India's No. 1 wicketkeeper batsman \n\nWhen Parthiv Patel played those entertaining knock against England, many doubted Wriddhiman Saha 's place in the side, but as Kohli has time and again mentioned, Saha is the first choice for India's wicketkeeper batsman. On Friday, making his comeback after missing out on the second half of the England Tests, Saha struck a second Test century. After giving Kohli company, he formed a 74-run stand with Ashwin and then an unbeaten 118 with Ravindra Jadeja that pushed India over the 650-run mark for the ninth time in Tests. \n\nSaha took over the mantle of scoring runs once Ashwin departed. He took Shakib Al Hasan and Mehedi Hasan for five fours and a six. Initially relying on deft flicks and a variety of cuts, Saha pressed on in the company of Jadeja. \n\nMissed chances continue to haunt Bangladesh \n\nBangladesh's outing in the field on Day 2 wasn't any different to what transpired on Day 1. Adding to their bizarre missed run out chance of Murali Vijay, Mushfiqur Rahim spilled a regulation stumping chance. With the ball beginning to turn, Wriddhiman Saha jumped out to Taijul Islam but failed to connect the heave. Mushfiqur had so much time that he missed the stumping twice. And when he finally took the bails off, Saha had made his ground. Saha obviously went on to score a century. \n\nIndia 3, Bangladesh 5 \n\nIf there was one department where Bangladesh outscored India, it was the number of centuries, not scored but the ones conceded. Three Indian batsmen - Murali Vijay, Virat Kohli and Wriddhiman Saha went on to register three-digit scores. But the Bangladesh bowlers outnumbered them with five centurions of their own. Taskin Ahmed (1/127), Kamrul Islam Rabbi (0/100), Mehedi Hasan (2/165), Shakib Al Hasan (0/104) and Taijul Islam (3/156), all gave away in excess of 100 runs. \n\nJadeja's batting stocks continue to rise \n\nJadeja's rapid growth as a batsman is something that has garnered a lot of praise. On Friday, the allrounder scored his third fifty in four innings. With India hinting on declaration and Saha nearing a century, Jadeja had his share of fun plundering the Bangladesh attack. He deposited Taijul into the second tier beyond long-on and followed it with a powerful slog-sweep over midwicket in the next. Making the most of a dropped catch on 40, Jadeja produced his fifth fifty in Tests.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T16:51:18.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
