A further 11 people have also been questioned. \nThe Sun said the matter came to light after an offender was arrested when they should have been under curfew. 'Zero tolerance' \nA 46-year-old former EMS employee was arrested in Romford, Essex, for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and the theft of tagging equipment. \nPolice said a house was searched and items of evidence recovered. \nA 45-year-old man from Barking and a 57-year-old woman from Romford have been questioned for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. \nA further 11 people - none of whom are former or current EMS employees - have been questioned on the same charge. \nAll 14 have been bailed to dates in April. \nAn EMS spokesperson said: \"We have a zero tolerance policy against any of our employees who act in any way to undermine the robustness of the electronic monitoring service. \n\"The small number of employees being investigated regarding this isolated issue were swiftly taken off duties and we are closely co-operating with the Metropolitan Police Service.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:38:52.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
