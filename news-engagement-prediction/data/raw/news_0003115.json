When the hallowed hour came, viewers tuned in to find two cans of lima beans sitting on a counter, accompanied by a simple message: “Thank you for joining me as I make a very special decision regarding my nomination for tonight’s dinner. Like for left can, heart for right can.” Without context, the video appears to be an inscrutable Dada masterpiece—but those who follow the news closely must know exactly what Bee was referencing. Earlier this week, Donald Trump promised to unveil his pick for a Supreme Court nominee Tuesday night. The suspense surrounding the decision was unorthodox, seemingly turning the business of government into a prime-time TV event—inspiring some to compare the announcement to a reality TV results show, the sort of thing you might see on The Bachelor or, yes, Trump’s old NBC joint, The Apprentice. For those wondering who Trump picked, he went with Judge Neil Gorsuch. As for Bee? She went with the can that didn’t have some juice dripping down the side. Good for her.
