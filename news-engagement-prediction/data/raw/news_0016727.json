With the defender's back turned, Gronewold decided to inbound the ball off her back. The ball came back to Gronewold and she nailed the three-pointer at the buzzer for the tie. \nThis is the best video we have right now, via Sean Barie of WGEM in Quincy , but it captures the moment. Also note how, during the celebration, Gronewold puts her arm up in a shrug, suggesting this was not a designed play and one she came up with on the fly. I don't believe what I just saw! For the tie at the buzzer!! pic.twitter.com/GPOVHh0thm â€” Sean Barie (@Sean_WGEM) February 4, 2017 \nQuincy went on to win the game in overtime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:34:44.771+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
