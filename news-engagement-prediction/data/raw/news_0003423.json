The federal dollars went toward funding multiyear research projects and other expenditures, according to the university’s website.\nIf U.C. Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - NO FEDERAL FUNDS?\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom fired back at Trump over Twitter , posting, “As a UC Regent I’m appalled at your willingness to deprive over 38,000 students access to an education because of the actions of a few.”\nNewsom wasn’t alone.\nRep. Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, also issued a statement criticizing Trump’s threat to take away funding from the university.\n“President Donald Trump cannot bully our university into silence. Simply put, President Trump’s empty threat to cut funding from UC Berkeley is an abuse of power,” Lee said.\nTrump’s tweet confused some UC officials, who stressed that the university was committed to ensuring that the event would proceed, as long as the well-being of students were not in jeopardy.\n“It’s hard to discern what (the tweet) means given that the university went through extraordinary lengths to prevent violence, went through extraordinary lengths to facilitate the planning and presentation of the event,” Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for UC Berkeley, said Thursday morning. “And that the university has condemned the violence of all this behavior and deeply regrets the fact that basic First Amendment rights were unable to be supported last night.”\nRelated Stories UC Berkeley protest spills into city streets, buildings vandalized UC Berkeley cancels right-wing provocateur’s talk amid violent protest Yiannopoulos: ‘The Left is absolutely terrified of free speech’ The event, organized by the Berkeley College Republicans, wasn’t canceled until two hours before the event when 150 masked protestors came on campus and interrupted an “otherwise nonviolent protest,” according to a statement from the university.\nMogulof attributed the destruction that took place on campus to nearly “two dozen black clad individuals using power military tactics.”\n“I’m not sure how one plans for the unprecedented,” Mogulof said, referring to the individuals “swathed in black from head to toe.”\nProtesters began throwing fireworks and pulling down metal barricades outside the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union, where the event was set to take place. Police evacuated Yiannopoulos, an editor for the far-right website Breitbart News, for his own safety.\nPolice had prepared for protests by calling “dozens of police officers” in for help from other university campuses, UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks said Thursday.\nOnce protesters “invaded” the campus, police determined that it was in the safety of both Yiannopoulos and the students to cancel the event, the university’s statement said.\nMogulof emphasized that university officials and police did not engage in violence against anyone that participated in the event.\nThere were no arrests. Five people were hurt, but university officials said no one was seriously injured.\nYiannopoulos himself cited “violence from the left” for the cancellation of the event, writing on Facebook:\n“One thing we do know for sure: the Left is absolutely terrified of free speech and will do literally anything to shut it down.”\nIn a statement, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin condemned the “small minority of protesters” that engaged in violence and vandalized businesses and properties throughout the city.\n“They also provided the ultra-nationalist far right exactly the images they want to use to try to discredit the vast majority of peaceful protesters in Berkeley and across America who are deeply concerned about where our country is heading,” Arreguin said.\nArreguin tweeted during the protest that, “Using speech to silence marginalized communities and promote bigotry is unacceptable. Hate speech isn’t welcome in our community.”\nHe also denounced the violence and destruction that erupted shortly after the protest started.\nIn its statement, UC Berkeley officials added: “While we have made clear our belief that the inflaming rhetoric and provocations of Mr. Yiannopoulos were in marked opposition to the basic values of the university, we respected his right to come to campus and speak once he was invited to do so by a legitimate student group.\n“The violence last night was an attack on the fundamental values of the university, which stands for and helps to maintain and nurture open inquiry and an inclusive civil society, the bedrock of a genuinely democratic nation.”\nYiannopoulos’ last stop on his speaking tour was expected to be Thursday at UCLA. However, Bruin Republicans issued a statement that he canceled because they “were unable to accommodate the long list of requirements that were set forth by Milo’s team.”\nSarah Ravani is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
