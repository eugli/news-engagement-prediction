Slot to Kentucky Links \nNorman (Okla.) North 5-star point guard Trae Young will make his college decision Thursday. \nYoung (6-2, 176), who is ranked 18th overall and the No. 3 point guard in the 2017 class by the 247Sports Composite , trimmed his list to six in July: Kansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas Tech and Washington. \nFor all intents and purposes, the Wildcats' recruitment of Young ended back in the fall with the signing of Philadelphia (Pa.) Neumann Goretti point guard and fellow 5-star Quade Green . \nNevertheless, in an all-access piece with USA Today, Young weighed the pros and cons of all six schools, including Kentucky, to some interesting results. \nGet the latest UK news sent straight to your inbox with out EMAIL NEWSLETTER \nFirst of all, Young's father, Ray, said if it were up to him, UK would be the choice, in part because of head coach John Calipari . \n\"If it was up to me this would be my pick. Coach (John) Cal, man! Coach Cal!\" the elder Young said. \n\"The track record is second to none to me. Then you've got K.P. ( Kenny Payne ), we really liked him. Honestly, the best thing about that visit was seeing Coach Cal outside of the basketball arena and spending time with he and his wife. I love how Kentucky prepares you to be a pro because that's all it is in Lexington – Kentucky basketball.\" \nAmong the cons, surprisingly, was the Wildcat Coal Lodge, which just opened in 2012 and received a budget request of $21 million for renovations in January of 2016. \n\"They've got the worst dorms out of all the schools,\" Young's mother said. \"You've gotta live there for nine months. I mean, come on now, it was one room, the sink was in the bedroom; definitely traditional old school dorm room.\" \n\"Yeah they did,\" added Trae Young. \"But to Coach Cal’s point, you don't pick a school based on the housing.\" \nTrae Young also touched on something Calipari has talked about before: the negative connotation of not being one-and-done. \n\"The other con is that, going there, if you're not a one-and-done you’re looked at differently,\" Young said. \"Like you weren’t built for Kentucky or something like that. I didn’t like that.\" \nCalipari has had 18 one and dones at Kentucky, all of which have gone in the first round of the NBA Draft. \nOf the 11 multi-year players under Calipari, only three have gone in the first round, with six going in the second and two going undrafted. \nIn the piece, Young names a top three of Kansas, Oklahoma and Oklahoma State. \nCurrently, Kansas holds a slim lead over Oklahoma in Young's 247Sports Crystal Ball. \nSign up now and get 3 months of VIP access to CatsPause.com for the price of 1!
