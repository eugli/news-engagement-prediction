While she’s in the midst of preparing for Sunday’s runway show, the designer found time last night to dash uptown for a Q&A session with Roopal Patel at Saks Fifth Avenue about her collection. In between meetings, Beckham hopped on the phone to explain her Fashion Week travel essentials, her ever-evolving style, and how she manages to look paparazzi-ready at all times. “Throughout the week, the shoes will turn into trainers and the dresses will turn into baggy trousers,” laughed Beckham about her new off-duty style grounded by sneakers . “It’s about being comfortable this week,” said the designer. “There’s a lot to do because we spend the whole week working around the clock in a pre-production space.” On her essentials list are baggy trousers , cool kicks, and a comfy knit. “Something that makes it easy to move around,” said Beckham, who has demonstrated her flexibility in everything from cocktail frocks to trousers in heels .

Beckham, who sports comfortable shell-toed sneakers at work, also loves to wear her own haute “Victoria” heels with some of her Mondrian-inspired fashions. The hybrid shoe-boot style comes in white, blue, and brown. “They’re great looking shoes but comfortable as well,” she said. As for bags, Beckham won’t budge on revealing her newest silhouettes. “I can give you a little bit of a hint,” she laughed. “I’m collaborating with people at the moment, and one particular collaboration has influenced the accessories for the show.” Photo: Splash News But one thing Beckham is ready for is Valentine’s Day, which always falls during Fashion Week. “It’ll be nice to spend the time as a family—just to be with David and the kids,” she said. Another upcoming occasion that will bring the family together is Beckham’s OBE ceremony. While the designer hasn’t figured out an appropriately dignified outfit to wear when she receives the royal honor, she has a few ideas—but is keeping them closely guarded. “I will keep you guessing.\" In This Story: Victoria Beckham Recommended For You", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T20:25:19.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
