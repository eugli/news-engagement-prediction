'Global revolution' \nMr Farage said: \"They are simply not prepared to accept that Brexit happened, that Trump happened. \n\"They kind of want to turn the clock back and what they don't realise is they are losing viewers, they are losing listeners, they are losing this battle big time. \n\"I am pleased that the president is not afraid to stand up to them.\" \nMr Trump continued his attack on the media on Saturday when he announced he would not attend the annual correspondents' dinner, traditionally addressed by US presidents. \nIt came after he barred several news organisations, including the BBC, from a White House press briefing, labelling them as \"fake news\". \nMeanwhile, Mr Farage told the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this week that the UK's decision to leave the European Union begun a movement that would spread across the globe. \n\"What happened in 2016 is the beginning of a great global revolution\", he said, before predicting a similar situation to the Brexit decision arising in the Netherlands, France and Germany.
