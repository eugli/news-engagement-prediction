made them cross the road to the other side from where we were and began to lead them further into the bush,” he said. \nMr. Aliyu said at that point they were able to get up and witness what was going on. \nHe said a member of the team, a hunter, whose phone had been snatched by the kidnappers, asked others to go after the attackers. \n“But only one of us followed him and the two men crossed the road chasing after the kidnappers,” he said. “When they realised that the two men and many other locals joined in their pursuit, they turned and opened fire killing the hunter and the other man.” \nKaduna police spokesperson, Aliyu Usman, told PREMIUM TIMES on Wednesday said special operatives had been deployed to rescue them. \n“So far, there has been no ransom demand or contact from the abductors,” Mr Usman, an assistant superintendent of police, said. “Unfortunately the victims did not go to site with the policemen attached to them for security,” he added.
