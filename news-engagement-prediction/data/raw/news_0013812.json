That order went a step further ordering that the government could not \"detain or remove\" those who arrived legally from the seven countries subject to Trump's order.

Feb. 3 - Federal judge temporarily halts key provisions of order US District Court Judge James Robart blocked the ban nationwide . He ruled that the states that filed the lawsuit \"have met their burden of demonstrating that they face immediate and irreparable injury as a result of the signing and implementation of the executive order.\" February 5 - Government's request denied A federal appeals court rejected the US government's emergency request to resume the ban. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco asked both sides to file legal briefs before the court makes it final decision.
