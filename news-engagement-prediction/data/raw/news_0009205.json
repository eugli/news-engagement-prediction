Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA drug dealer ran a ‘cannabis empire’ from behind bars - with the help of a hospital porter. \nThomas Rayment, 26, of Green Hill, Prestwich, was remanded at HMP Forest Bank, back in May 2015, after his network of cannabis farms was raided by police. \nThe operations - at addresses in Bury, Wythenshawe and Cheetham Hill - were capable of yielding thousands of pounds worth of the drug. \nWithin a few weeks of his incarceration, Rayment got his cousin, 24-year-old hospital porter Daniel Williams, to smuggle him a sim card into prison. \nArmed with the SIM, Rayment was able to ring his mum and girlfriend on a contraband phone and to carry on running his drug enterprise, with Daniel Williams help, while serving time on remand. \nFrom his jail cell, Rayment conspired with Williams to set up two new farms with a £14,000 yield. Williams set up one at at his own home at Vesper Street, Failsworth, and another at the Moston home of his 53-year-old father, Glenn Williams.

Thomas Rayment (L) and Daniel Williams \nRachel Faux, defending Glenn Williams, said there was little prospect of him being back before the courts. She said: “He’s vulnerable because of his poor health - he has a history of strokes - and vulnerable because he’s the father of a child who asked him to help out.” \nSentencing, Judge Martin Steiger QC said: “Rayment had significant degree of control over his cannabis empire once he had been sent to prison.” Read More Teacher jailed after hurling drunken racist abuse - and MOCKING a brain-damaged passenger on a plane \nDetective Sergeant Andy Buckthorpe, of GMP’s Challenger Manchester, said: “The seizure of these plants ensured a significant amount of cannabis was unable find its way on to the streets of Greater Manchester and fund further criminal activity. \n“Today’s sentence should send a firm message to anyone who thinks they can get away with cultivating and supplying illegal drugs.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T08:16:17.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
