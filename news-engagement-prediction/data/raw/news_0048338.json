Dopps was granted a patent for the lipstick on January 10 proving there may not be a single female working at the US Patent and Trademark office. \nThe good doctor has said he won’t be making the product himself (thank goodness) and advises it’s a “personal hygiene product and should not be shared with others.” \nAs if there is a woman alive who would tap another female on the shoulder and utter the words “I don’t suppose you’ve got any vag glue I could borrow?” \n9 FOODS THAT CAN HELP BOOST YOUR LIBIDO NATURALLY \nNaturally, after testing the waters on his Facebook page, the response was swift and harsh. But proving he’s the ever-diplomatic inventor, Dopps responded to the concerns of potential customers with these carefully considered words: \n“[Y]ou as a woman should have come up with a better solution than diapers and plugs, but you didn’t. Reason being women are focused on and distracted by your period 25 percent of the time, making them far less productive than they could be.” \nI think it might be time for Dopps to take his magical lipstick and use it to glue his own lips shut.
