There were also confrontations between parents in the stands.\nThe referee stopped the game but was confronted by a parent as he left the ice.\nA senior refereeing official was called in and the game continued but only after the parents involved were kicked out of the game and banned from attending their children's game the following day at the Burnaby Winter Club.\n \"Police were contacted on Saturday after an incident. They asked us to come back Sunday to standby to keep the peace,\" confirmed Burnaby RCMP spokesman John Buis.\nTerry Shein of the Burnaby Winter Club told CBC News that only bench staff from the North Vancouver team was allowed to attend the Sunday game.
