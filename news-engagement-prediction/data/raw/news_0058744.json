It sounds like Potter is doing better than ever and has her eyes set on the future. Her mother told People , “This is the first time I’ve seen her happy in months. She’s looking forward to the future.” \nShe’s also making a guest appearance on “Switched At Birth” on April 11, and has even mentioned starting a job hunt outside of Hollywood . Potter certainly isn’t letting this unfortunate event slow her down. \nYou go, girl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:55:14.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
