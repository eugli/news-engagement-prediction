Right of the bat this may seem like it means relatively little, unless you’re already aware of the significance of the model number. The LG Stylo 2 model number was L82VL, so it’s quite likely that this is the successor to that device. The LG Stylo 2 was also a device which hit a handful of carriers in the U.S., including TracFone, Cricket, and Verizon. A “Plus” model even hit T-Mobile and MetroPCS while the device labeled as the LG Stylo 2 4G went to Boost Mobile. Considering this, if this is the LG Stylo 3 it’s quite possible that it will be heading to Verizon as well as a number of other carriers. \nThere isn’t a whole lot of detail to be picked up from the FCC filing, unfortunately, but there are a couple of pieces of information. It’s also worth noting that the LG Stylo 3 has already been announced and it was shown off at CES this year so that is not really anything else to learn about it in terms of hardware or features, though at the time there was no mention of what carriers would be picking it up. In the filing there was a diagram of the FCC label showing a rectangular shape meant to depict the phone so as to showcase the location of the label on the back. It does not however actually show a drawing of the phone itself. Again though, the phone has already been unveiled so there is nothing about the design that hasn’t already been seen. \nThe filing also lists that the phone is based on CDMA technology, at least for this particular model, which makes Verizon an even more likely candidate for one of the places where this phone will end up. While it’s too early to tell exactly where this version of the phone will go in terms of carriers, the fact that it’s CDMA ensures that it won’t be T-Mobile or AT&T, or any other GSM carrier, though it could very well hit GSM networks in a different variant. When exactly this phone will launch and how much it will cost is still unclear.
