(Photo: Jeremy Papasso, AP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLOS ANGELES — Bill Maher’s decision to book conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos on his HBO show drew quick condemnation from another guest. \nJeremy Scahill, a journalist who’s appeared frequently on Real Time with Bill Maher , posted on Twitter that he won’t appear as a panelist Friday because of Yiannopoulos and what he represents. \n“He has ample venues to spew his hateful diatribes. There is no value in ‘debating’ him,” Scahill tweeted. Appearing on Maher’s show will give Yiannopoulos a major platform for “his racist, anti-immigrant campaign,” wrote Scahill, co-founding editor of The Intercept news website. \nSchahill said he respects Maher’s show as an arena for debate and discussion but called Yiannopoulous “many bridges too far.” Why I will not appear this week on Real Time with Bill Maher. pic.twitter.com/SOoE3udrDr — jeremy scahill (@jeremyscahill) February 15, 2017 \nHBO confirmed that Scahill had canceled. There was no immediate comment from Maher. \nIn an email Wednesday to The Associated Press, Yiannopoulos said that “public shaming and grandstanding don’t work any more. … Thanks for proving my point for me, Jeremy Scahill! You can look forward to pulling out of a lot more shows in the next few decades.” \nRead more: Milo Yiannopoulos buys more time for controversial book \nYiannopoulos writes for Breitbart News, considered by many a platform for the so-called “alt-right” movement, an offshoot of conservatism that mixes racism, white nationalism and populism. \nHis Twitter account was suspended last year after a series of racially insensitive tweets aimed at “Ghostbusters” actress Leslie Jones, who is black. Yiannopoulos has denied he is a white nationalist or racist.
