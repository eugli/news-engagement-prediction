Do you not announce it on social because what if the baby grows up and resents you forever because of it? Beyonce shows off her baby bump in an Instagram post announcing her pregnancy. Photo: Instagram/@beyonce A photo posted by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST \nIn it she kneels before an altar of flowers (to herself!) wearing mismatched sexy knickers and of course the pièce de résistance, a VEIL. She looks straight at the camera (WHO IS THE PHOTOGRAPHER) with a beatific fierceness. Advertisement \nShe is like a muse of one of the old masters. She is the Renaissance. She is blissfully serene, but would cut a b*tch should they dare cross her cubs. This photo will hang in a gallery one day (or maybe some kind of space crypt in 1000 years?). The people will fly in on rocket boots to take selfies with the chips in their eyes in front of it, a pilgrimage in times when they need resilience and strength to go on. \nBut perhaps even more than this prophecy for how this image will live on, Bey has also given us all a guide to how to make the perfect pregnancy announcement post. Herewith: Step 1 \nOwn your gloriousness. \nYes, you are probably tired and sick and all you want to eat is a ham sandwich and drink a can of cola and the whole world is judging you , but you are doing something amazing. Practise your pose before you unveil your belly to the world. Step 2 \nGet someone who knows how to take photos to take yours. \nIf you can't swing for a professional you are well within your rights to harangue your partner/best friend/mother to get the photo right. Step 3 \nIt can be sexy. \nBecoming a mother doesn't mean you automatically have to ditch the frilly knickers or sensuality (weird right). That said, if you'd rather sit on the couch in your trackies this is also entirely acceptable. Step 4 \nBe true to who you are. \nFeel that hanging off a trapeze is the best way to sum up the kind of family your baby is being welcomed into? Go for it (erm, maybe check with a doctor first?) Fancy recreating a scene from Fifty Shades (remember your colleagues/future child might see it but go ahead!)? A tribute to David Bowie (amazing)? A coffee cup with a cute message? Whatever scene you set, make it you. Step 5 \nWear a veil. \nPreferably also be Beyonce. But honestly, how many times in life do you get to wear a veil? Step 6 \nRevel in everybody sharing in your joy. \nAt the time of writing Bey is currently sitting on 4,657,398 likes. So, goals.
