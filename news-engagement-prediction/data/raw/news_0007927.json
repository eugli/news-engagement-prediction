(Stacy Revere/Getty Images) Rob Bolton lists his five against-the-grain fantasy selections for this week's event. \nRoberto Castro ... While he’s admitted that he’s comfortable heating up as summertime encroaches, the 31-year-old is 5-for-5 this season. The only slight is that he’s still chasing his first top 25 in a full-field event since a solo third at the BMW Championship secured a ticket to East Lake and carte-blanche scheduling for 2016-17. Currently eighth in proximity to the hole and 33rd in scrambling. Hasn’t seen the redesign of TPC Scottsdale, but finished inside the top 20 in both of his previous appearances (2013, 2014). \nBryce Molder … The local resident has been faithful to this event essentially since he began qualifying for it regularly on merit in 2010. The devotion has rewarded him in kind with seven consecutive paydays, four of which for a top 25. Last year’s T6 was a personal best. For the week, he ranked fourth in birdies-or-better percentage, third in scrambling, second in putts per greens in regulation and authored the lowest score of the tournament with a 64 in the third round. \nJim Herman … Back to avenge missing the cut in his debut here last year. He does so having linked three top 15s together for the first time in his career stretching 127 PGA TOUR starts. His latest was a solo 10th at Waialae. He’s also connected 13 red numbers dating back to the second round of the OHL Classic of Mayakoba. Ranks 16th in total driving, fifth in greens hit and 29th in conversion percentage inside 10 feet. \nTyrone Van Aswegen … For most intents and purposes, he should be hitting his career peak, but the 35-year-old late bloomer from South Africa seems to be just now hitting his stride after finally getting over the hump of needing the Web.com Tour Finals to secure his PGA TOUR card. He graduated from each of the first three editions before finishing 98th in the FedExCup standings in 2015-16. Just 3-for-8 this season but 70th in points thanks to a pair of top 20s, including a T20 last week at Torrey Pines. He ranked 18th in strokes gained: tee-to-green and fifth in proximity on the South Course. In his first look at TPC Scottsdale last year, he finished T17, slotting 15th in strokes gained: tee-to-green and fourth in proximity. \nBrian Gay … Best known as a small-ball artist, the 45-year-old has missed only two cuts in 14 appearances at TPC Scottsdale and not since 2012. He remains one of the most accurate touring pros off the tee (36th in accuracy) and one of the deadliest on the greens (10th in strokes gained: putting). While the four-time PGA TOUR winner hasn’t kept a flame burning since returning from an entire season off (2014-15) due to injury, he’s still managed to flicker long enough at Waialae for a T13 just three weeks ago, easily his best result in seven months.
