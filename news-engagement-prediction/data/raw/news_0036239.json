After approximately twenty minutes, K-9 Freya found the missing child, curled up, hiding in the woods.”\nWhile definitely scared, the child was found in good heath, said the post, which also called Freya “a hero” for her efforts.\n“This potential tragic story finished with a happy ending,” said Sheriff Randy Smith in a statement. “Our canines are amazing animals who are invaluable to our deputies and citizens.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/stpso/posts/1262274353856537"], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:51:40.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
