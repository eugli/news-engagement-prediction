Although Mourinho has claimed publicly that he has no problem with the full-back and likes him as a player , his prolonged absence from the first team squad suggests otherwise. \nUnited are leading their Round of 32 tie against Saint-Étienne 3-0 after an emphatic victory in the first leg, yet Shaw has not even been included in the party that flew to France on Tuesday, even though Mourinho has no intention of naming a full strength side and has a cup final to worry about at the weekend. \nShaw has played just one game for United since the end of November, starting against Wigan Athletic in the FA Cup on January 29 th but he did not figure in last Sunday’s fifth-round win over Blackburn Rovers.
