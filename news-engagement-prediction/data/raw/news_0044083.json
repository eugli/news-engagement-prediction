As the preseason momentum begins to roll into the regular season, here's a look at what you might have missed this weekend: Villa's VAR send-off \nNew York City FC is out in Tuscon, Arizona for the 2017 Desert Diamond Cup, one of the places MLS is testing out video assistant referees (VAR) in-game during the preseason, and reigning MLS MVP David Villa ended up on the receiving end of the first ejection issued by formal review. \nAfter scoring a goal earlier in the match, Villa was battling with Houston Dynamo center back A.J. DeLaGarza , when he struck the defender in the face. The act initially earned a yellow card before the formal review led to a red card for violent conduct against an opponent. He'll serve a one-game suspension in NYCFC’s next match, against the Colorado Rapids on February 22, and be available for the match on February 25. \nIf all goes as it should, the VAR test this preseason is set to extend, with live, in-game testing during the second half of the 2017 regular-season slate.
