In a newly viral gender reveal video reported by PopSugar , an expecting mom almost literally loses her shit when she finds out she's having a baby girl.\nBaby gender preference is definitely a (totally fine and normal) thing among pregnant women and dads-to-be alike. But Egreis Gjergjani's hilariously dramatic behavior after being handed a gender reveal cake slice with pink frosting takes that to a whoooole new level.
