A Global News crew at the scene has since determined that the man was in a motorized scooter. The article has been updated to reflect that. \nThe RCMP said they had to reroute traffic in front of Sherwood Park Mall as officers investigated a “serious injury collision” Sunday afternoon. \nPolice said the collision happened at Sherwood Drive and Oak Street between 3:30 p.m. and 4 p.m. It involved a vehicle and a 79-year-old man on a motorized scooter. \nAccording to Mounties, the man on the scooter was in a crosswalk at the time he was hit and suffered serious injuries. \nThey said the driver of the vehicle, an 81-year-old man, was taken to hospital as a precaution. \nPolice said it was too early to say if charges would be laid. \nAnyone with information about the collision is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 1.800.222.8477 or online . \nPolice cleared the scene shortly after 5:30 p.m. The scene had been cleared. No more police presence at oak st and Sherwood drive. #shpk #yeg \n— Julia Wong (@JWongGlobalNews) February 13, 2017 \n-With files from Julia Wong. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
