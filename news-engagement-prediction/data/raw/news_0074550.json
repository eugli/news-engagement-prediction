He retired a couple of years ago after over 35 years of service. Living with his parents in Tardeo and later shifting to Napean Sea Road, Narwankar spent 18 years of his service in D ward — Malabar Hill, Raj Bhavan, Girgaum Chowpatty, Nana Chowk.\nAlso Read: Determined Shiv Sena and BJP struggle to gain mayoral control \n\nNarwankar, who got 8,541 votes, defeated BJP's Ramesh Naik with a margin of more than 3,000 votes.\nLuck by chance \nThe delimitation of wards turned out to be a turning point for Narwankar after Congress loyal Naushir Mehta and his family members decided not to contest for the first time in 50 years due to OBC reservation on the seat. Narwankar, who was close to Mehta, then got the opportunity.\nRead Story: Defeated BJP candidate held for attack on MNS leader \n\"Fifteen years ago, I had got my first offer from Congress, but I couldn't take it up then due to some problem. After my retirement, senior party leaders approached me again and I decided to join. I started working for the party two years ago but wasn't sure that I would be given a ticket. Looks like it was in my destiny,\" he said.\nWhen asked about changes he wants to bring in in the BMC, Narwankar told mid-day, \"I did social work during my office days. I worked in the waste management and drainage department for most years of my service. Now, my focus will be to arrive at a permanent solution for cleaning house gullies, curb contamination of water, and control health-related problems in the area. BMC has a lot of funds, proper utilisation is what's lacking.\"\n\n8,541 No of votes that Narwankar got\n35 No. of years he worked in the BMC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:57:18.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
