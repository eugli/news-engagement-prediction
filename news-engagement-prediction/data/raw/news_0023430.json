Go deeper... deeper! (moaning) Boy: Mmmm Girl: Come up! You are good for nothing. \nWhile going down on a woman, guys should always know that the 'V' of a woman is the most sensitive area. It's not always about pleasure, but satisfaction as well. You also have to take care not to hurt her and even push her to reach the climax. \nBut what remains a major and confusing question among the men species is that of HOW EXACTLY TO DO IT? One woman says go to the left, another asks to be soft, while the internet articles and tutorials are all the way different. \nThe following were a few replies from different women when asked, \"What should everybody who performs oral sex on a woman know?\" \nI'm sure these will surely help you train yourself and be a better performer from the next time. Different Women Express How It Should Be Done When Going Down On Them 754 396 #1 Don't just ring a doorbell dude; there's more to it! Loading... \nLúu Novaski: \"Go to Google and type: VAGINA. Now, take a good look at where the clitoris is. Seriously, it's really not at all that difficult.\" #2 It's not all about pleasure; that place is sensitive. Loading... \nAna Cicino: \"Don't be frantically licking all over it like there's no tomorrow, just any old way it pleases you. It gets sensitive down there, and it's not pleasurable at all when you overdo it. Go slow, be gentle with it.\" #3 Don't be too excited! Don't be too wild! Loading... \nCamila Leite: \"Your tongue is not a penis. Oral sex has to be like a well-placed kiss: moist, unhurried, and organized. It's not just about seeing how far you can stick your stiff tongue in.\" #4 Sucking is not good always. Loading... \nWanessa Silva Macedo: \"Stop it with the toilet plunger impersonation! The clitoris is a sensitive area! If the girl is pulling back, get a hold of yourself.\" #5 It's NOT taffy! Loading... \nTerumy Reybaud: \"Stop treating the hood of the clitoris and the lips like they're taffy. Pulling, stretching, and tugging. Just…no!\" #6 Stop stretching out your tongue like a dog. Loading... \nMaria Eugênia Teixeira: \"If you're acting like a dog lapping up water from a dish, you're probably doing something wrong.\" #7 The other parts of the body are also sensitive and need your warmth. Loading... \nLuana Shaedler: \"Massaging and kissing the vulva (the external part of the vagina), and touching and caressing before beginning oral sex really helps. Don't forget the rest of the body either, especially the legs and back.\" #8 Keep on doing it. Loading... \nTalita Azevedo: \"Women take longer to climax than men do. Don't think that three minutes down there is going to get her where she's going because it won't.\" #9 There's a reason behind fidgeting. Loading... \nAmanda Kontz: \"If she's fidgeting around, don't keep hitting the same spot! Sometimes she just wants to adjust you without having to say 'more to the right' or 'more to the left'.\" #10 Look into detail and compliment. Loading... \nLuana Shaedler: \"Many women don't think they're very attractive down there, which is bullshit! Take a good look and say, with sincerity, what you like about her vagina and be specific! What's appealing about the color, shape, scent, taste…\" #11 Good going then! Loading... \nLuana Shaedler: \"When the woman is really quiet, sometimes even silent or only lightly moaning, it's almost always a good sign! Women like this to be a truly intimate moment, with no pressure and especially no rush!\" #12 Not any faster, not any slower. Exactly like that! Loading... \nGabriele Bessa: \"Rhythm is everything! You're better off trying to keep the same rhythm than thinking that you need to samba all over the place with your tongue! Did you hear that little gasp? KEEP IT UP!\" #13 Finger and tongue go best together. Loading...
