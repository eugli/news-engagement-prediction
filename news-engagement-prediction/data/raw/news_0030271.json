Jose Mourinho’s side are currently sixth , a point behind fourth place Liverpool. Mesut Ozil suffering CRISIS of confidence, admits Arsenal boss Wenger \nDespite currently sitting outside the much coveted top four positions, Blind is in no doubt Manchester United will be there by the end of the season. \n‘It will be close and we’ll need to focus and win our games but I’m sure we’ll be in the top four by the end of season,’ he told MUTV . \nManchester United beat Watford thanks to goals from Juan Mata and Anthony Martial in what was a routine victory at Old Trafford. However, Blind would have liked to have seen his side score more goals. \n‘You want to finish the chances. The second goal was good for Anthony and well deserved. \n‘We deserved to win and created many chances. We could have finished more of the chances; everyone wanted the ball. The second half was more difficult as they changed their system a bit but, overall, it was a good win.’ Martial was on the scoresheet on Saturday (Getty) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:40:13.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
