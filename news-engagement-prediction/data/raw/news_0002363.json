Donald Trump and Neil Gorsuch shake hands. (photo credit:REUTERS) \nWASHINGTON -- US President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court on Tuesday night, fulfilling his campaign promise to nominate a documented judicial conservative to the nation's justiceship.Gorsuch currently serves as a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. If confirmed by the Senate, he will take the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, considered a lion of the law and a hero of the political Right.   Scalia died over a year ago, leaving a vacancy on the nine-judge court. But Republican Senate leadership refused to entertain then-president Barack Obama's choice for the seat, Merrick Garland, casting the vacancy as a choice the American people to make through the selection of their next president. Garland, had he been confirmed, would have brought to four the number of Jewish justices on the court. Trump campaigned on a promise to select his nominee for Scalia's seat from a published list of known conservatives. Gorsuch, 49, was on that list.Gorsuch characterizes his judicial philosophy in similar terms as Scalia: He considers himself a textualist on statutes, and believes the US Constitution should be enforced as it was originally interpreted. He has weighed in in favor of \"religious freedom\" laws that have allowed for exceptions to and restrictions on reproductive rights, although he has not personally issued any rulings on abortion from the bench.Born in Colorado, Gorsuch attended Columbia University, Harvard Law School, and Oxford University for his doctorate. He clerked for both Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy before a short stint in private practice.Judgeships on the Supreme Court are lifetime appointments.
