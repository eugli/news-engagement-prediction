But one new campaign is taking a different spin—it’s basically a reverse boycott. British beauty company Illamasqua took a stand against Donald Trump by announcing that they “will never knowingly sell our products to people who support President Trump’s values.” Doubling down, they went on to say that they want anyone who buys their makeup to take what they call an “anti-fascism”* pledge, which includes agreeing not to discriminate against anyone for their race, color, nationality, ethnicity, gender, age, disability, sexual orientation, or religion, plus “accepting responsibility” on climate and social issues, and supporting the intentions of an anti-intolerance British charity, The Sophie Lancaster Foundation . Asking people to take a pledge before they shop sounds pretty hardcore, but it’s more a way to promote a message than an actual requirement—you don’t literally have to sign or say anything, and #MAGA fans can still stock up on Antimatter Lipstick and Radiance Veil primer. But Illamasqua founder Julian Kynaston explains that yeah, they really mean they don’t want business from people who are racist, sexist, homophobic, and so on. “We know we can’t physically stop people from buying our products,” he says. “However, we are doing all that we can to ensure everyone knows what our pledge stands for. We have posters in store, our staff have all been fully briefed, and we are communicating across our website and social media. It really is designed to turn away sales from those we don't want buying our products.” You May Also Like Makeup The Upcoming Too Faced Clover Palette Is Perfect for Animal Lovers \nJust one of the out-of-the-box pigments the brand is known for—Illamasqua Cream Pigment in Bedaub This of course will raise some questions—like, in shunning certain customers, is Illamasqua itself being intolerant? In an email blast to the press, they wrote, “It's unethical to force people to change their beliefs, so we are politely asking those who don't agree with our values to stop buying our products.” And by focusing on discrimination rather than nitty-gritty policy, the pledge is in line with existing norms in our society anyway, not to mention with what the brand is known to stand for. Beauty editors count on Illamasqua for truly out-of-the-box colors . They’re known for their punk-y, to hell with the system attitude—they were ahead of the trend in putting older women in their ads back in 2012, and they even introduced a service to apply funeral makeup back in 2011. As Kynaston says, “We have a very diverse fan base and this act is very much designed to echo their views.” Ok, so maybe you’re thinking cynically, is this all just a publicity stunt to drive sales? Kynaston says no: “Let those who stand against [Trump] know they aren't alone. Yes, we will lose sales. Yes, we may gain support. We aren't thinking of the financial impact.” Makes sense—if your goal is a bigger bottom line, this is a pretty risky way to go about it. Since before the election, people have analyzed whether Trump’s policies are fascist—although some, including conservatives, have suggested that the word is appropriate, others disagree.
