Many of these immigrants have lived in the country for years but didn't apply to become citizens earlier, citing a lack of time or money for the application fees.\nIt's common for presidential elections and changes in the application process to spur citizenship increases.\nHere's a look at the process of becoming a citizen:\n___\nWHO CAN NATURALIZE?\nImmigrants can apply to become U.S. citizens through naturalization, but the process is not open to everyone.\nMost people must live here and have a green card for five years before applying. Spouses of American citizens can generally apply after three years with a green card.\nThe estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally don't have a direct path to citizenship. Nor can people here on work visas apply to become U.S. citizens without first getting green cards and going through the requisite wait.\nThere is a special process for immigrants in the military. Those serving since September 11, 2001 can immediately apply for citizenship.\n___\nHOW CAN IMMIGRANTS APPLY TO BECOME CITIZENS?\nTo become a U.S. citizen, an immigrant must file an application and pay $725 in fees. They must have their fingerprints taken and show they have \"good moral character.\"\nThey must also pass English language and a 10-question U.S. civics test that covers topics such as the Founding Fathers, Constitution and the presidency.\nIf approved for naturalization, immigrants attend a ceremony and take an oath as new American citizens.\nTypically, the process takes between five and six months.\n___\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GREEN CARD AND CITIZENSHIP?\nWith a green card, immigrants can live and work in the United States. But they still retain their country's passport and can't obtain most federal government jobs, vote in national elections or serve on a jury.\nIn addition, green card holders who are convicted of crimes can lose their legal status and be deported — not the case with U.S. citizens.\nOnce immigrants naturalize, they can apply for a U.S. passport and register to vote. It is also easier for them to bring relatives to join them here from overseas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:16:32.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
