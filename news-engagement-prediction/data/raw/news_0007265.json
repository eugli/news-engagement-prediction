particularly at a time when the horrific lessons of the last war seem in increasing danger of being forgotten.'\nThe charity was founded in 1933 to support people fleeing persecution from Nazi Europe.\nIt created the Kindertransport, which brought thousands of Jewish refugee children to Britain from Nazi Germany between 1938 and 1940.\nIt now supports vulnerable people in 18 countries through activities including disaster relief, employment skills and providing older people with food, medicine and companionship.\nCharles spoke of how he is proud to be a WJR patron because the charity sets an example of 'true compassion and true friendship'.\nIt does this by reaching beyond its community to help those in need, regardless of their faith, he said.\nPrince Charles, pictured today with a group of Scouts, spoke up for the need to protect refugees days after President Trump's executive order on immigration\nCharles has been a long-standing supporter of Jewish communities in the UK and abroad. He and the Duchess of Cornwall have previously attended the commemorative ceremony for Holocaust Memorial Day.\nThe audience applauded as Chief Rabbi criticised US President Donald Trump for his 'totally unacceptable' and discriminatory travel ban.\nThe Chief Rabbi talked about how the organisation gives people hope around the world.\nBut he said: 'Not much hope from the United States of America, of all countries, where President Trump appears to have signed an executive order which seems to discriminate against individuals based totally on their religion or their nationality.\n'We as Jews perhaps more than any others know exactly what it is like to be the victims of such discrimination and it is totally unacceptable.'\nMr Trump's temporary ban on nationals from seven mainly Muslim countries has caused chaos and outrage across the US, with travellers detained at airports and protesters registering opposition to the sweeping measure.\nNationals from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen are covered by the order.\nAt the same event, the Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis slammed Mr Trump's executive order, which halted immigration from seven majority Muslim countries for 90 days", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-01-31T20:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:53:59.413+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
