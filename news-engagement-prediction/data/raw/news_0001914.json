I would ask that anyone who thinks they may know something that could help to please come forward and contact police. 08:41 Man shot in leg \nA man has been shot in the leg in south Manchester. \nThe victim, 25, walked into a takeaway on Kingsway and told them he had been shot. \nEmergency services were called to the incident at 8.20pm on Thursday and the man was taken to hospital in an ambulance. \nA police spokesman said his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening. \nDetectives believe the man was shot on nearby Rosevale Avenue in Burnage and have taped the road off for forensic examinations.
