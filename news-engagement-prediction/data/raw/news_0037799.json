(PTI Photo) \nChennai: \nAs VK Sasikala’s dreams of a political career were shattered on Tuesday morning after the Supreme Court convicted her in a 21-year-old corruption case, the Golden Bay resort where most of the AIADMK’s MLAs have been holed up continues to be under scrutiny. \nRead more | Sasikala case: Stunned silence at Kovathur resort, celebration at OPS home \nThere is no clear account yet of whether the MLAs are being held there against their will or not. On Monday, Kancheepuram police reported to the Madras high court that the 129 MLAs inside “showed no sign of being held against their will,” resulting in the court adjourning the case. \nFollow | Live: Jayalalithaa’s niece Deepa joins Panneerselvam at memorial, Sasikala leaves resort \nNonetheless, numerous complaints about missing persons have been filed across Tamil Nadu, either by relatives of the MLAs or their families. \nAIADMK MLA Saravanan, from Madurai (South), claimed on Monday that he had to escape Golden Bay to join caretaker chief minister Panneerselvam. “I had to change my clothes and climb a wall,” the legislator said after he arrived at Panneerselvam’s residence. “I had to leave before Sasikala reached.” \nSaravanan maintains that the MLAs are being held against their will, and that their phones have either been taken away or have been switched off by the private guards employed by Sasikala. \nAn AIADMK leader in the Panneerselvam camp, who does not wish to be named, says that the caretaker CM is aware of the issues, and is in contact with some of the MLAs inside the Koovathur resort, but refused to clarify exactly how given the legislators’ lack of phones. \nRead more | ‘Pervading pestilent presence’: 5 quotes from Sasikala DA verdict that’ll awe you \nAt least 800 policemen, and teams from the Rapid Action Force, have been deployed at the Golden Bay resort where Sasikala is currently staying along with members of her family. \nA senior AIADMK member told HT that “Sasikala was furious,” after the verdict was pronounced, and immediately went into an emergency meeting with several key members of her camp, including Palanisami and Dindigul Sreenivasan. \nPolice have received directions to begin evacuating the MLAs, who earlier declared they would not leave until Governor Rao visited them, but have yet to act on them. \nTamil Nadu DGP TK Rajendran, who briefed the Governor along with Chennai police commissioner S George about the law and order situation, is yet to make the final decision. \nDespite constant statements asserting their choice to remain in the resort, the lack of media interaction and the heavy private security presence - some of whom, locals told HT, “speak like Maduraikaaran “(people from Madurai district) - suggests otherwise.
