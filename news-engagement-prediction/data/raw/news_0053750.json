Hall. Hall starred on Broadway last year in the musical Lazarus, based on Bowie's 1976 film The Man Who Fell to Earth , and has performed tributes to Bowie in the past, including a performance at the 2016 Mercury Prize ceremony. \n\"If David Bowie could be here tonight, he probably wouldn't be here,\" Hall said while accepting the award. \nAccepting the award on Bowie's behalf, and behalf of the singer's family, Hall vowed to \"accept this testament to a man beholden to nothing but own imagination.\" \nThe actor praised the late musical icon's work, saying, \"\"His daring artistic vitality soothes, sears and astounds us. His kindness, generosity and enthusiasm inspires me to be a better man.\" \nBowie's Blackstar was also up for album of the year.
