Acids are compounds that dissociate in water to donate hydrogen ions/protons or to accept electrons. Acetic acid is also known as ethanoic acid. LAGUNA DESIGN / Getty Images 1. Acetic Acid \nAcetic Acid: HC 2 H 3 O 2 Also known as: ethanoic acid , CH3COOH, AcOH.Acetic acid is found in vinegar. This acid is most often found in liquid form. Pure acetic acid (glacial) crystallizes just below room temperature. This is the chemical structure of boric acid. Todd Helmenstine 2. Boric Acid \nBoric Acid : H 3 BO 3 Also known as: acidum boricum, hydrogen orthoborate \nBoric acid may be used as a disinfectant or pesticide. It's usually found as a white crystalline powder. This is the chemical structure of carbonic acid. LAGUNA DESIGN / Getty Images 3. Carbonic Acid \nCarbonic Acid: CH 2 O 3 Also known as: aerial acid, acid of air, dihydrogen carbonate, kihydroxyketone. \nSolutions of carbon dioxide in water (carbonated water) may be called carbonic acid. This is the only acid excreted by the lungs as a gas. Carbonic acid is a weak acid. It is responsible for dissolving limestone to produce geological features such as stalagmites and stalactites. Citric acid is a weak acid found in citrus fruits and used as a natural preservative and to impart a sour flavoring. NEUROtiker, Wikipedia Commons 4. Citric Acid \nCitric Acid : H 3 C 6 H 5 O 7 \nAlso known as: 2-Hydroxy-1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid. \nCitric acid is a weak organic acid that gets its name because it is a natural acid in citrus fruits. The chemical is an intermediate species in the citric acid cycle, which is key for aerobic metabolism. The acid is widely used as a flavoring and acidifier in food. This is the chemical structure of hydrochloric acid. Todd Helmenstine 5. Hydrochloric Acid \nHydrochloric acid : HCl \nAlso known as marine acid, chloronium, spirit of salt. \nHydrochloric acid is a clear, highly corrosive strong acid. It's found in diluted form as muriatic acid. The chemical has many industrial and lab uses. HCl is the acid found in gastric juice. This is the chemical structure of hydrofluoric acid. Todd Helmenstine 6. Hydrofluoric Acid \nHydrofluoric Acid : HFAlso known as: hydrogen fluoride, hydrofluoride, hydrogen monofluoride, fluorhydric acid. \nAlthough it is highly corrosive, hydrofluoric acid is considered a weak acid because it doesn't usually dissociate completely. The acid will eat glass and metals, so HF is stored in plastic containers. HF is used to make fluorine compounds, including Teflon and Prozac. This is the chemical structure of nitric acid. Todd Helmenstine 7. Nitric Acid \nNitric Acid : HNO 3 Also known as: aqua fortis, azotic acid, engraver's acid, nitroalcohol. \nNitric acid is a strong mineral acid. In pure form, it is a colorless liquid. Over time, it develops a yellow color from decomposition into nitrogen oxides and water. Nitric acid is used to make explosives and inks and as a strong oxidizer for industrial and lab use. This is the chemical structure of oxalic acid. Todd Helmenstine 8. Oxalic Acid \nOxalic Acid : H 2 C 2 O 4 \nAlso known as: ethanedioic acid , hydrogen oxalate, ethanedionate, acidum oxalicum, HOOCCOOH, oxiric acid. \nOxalic acid gets its name because it was first isolated as a salt from sorrel ( Oxalis sp.). The acid is relatively abundant in green, leafy foods. It's also found in metal cleaners, anti-rust products, and some types of bleach. Phosphoric acid is also known as orthophosphoric acid or phosphoric(V) acid. Ben Mills 9. Phosphoric Acid \nPhosphoric Acid: H 3 PO 4 Also known as: orthophosphoric acid, trihydrogen phosphate, acidum phosphoricum. \nPhosphoric acid is a mineral acid used in home cleaning products, as a chemical reagent, as a rust inhibitor, and as a dental etchant. Phosphoric acid is also an important acid in biochemistry. This is the chemical structure of sulfuric acid. Todd Helmenstine 10. Sulfuric Acid \nSulfuric acid : H 2 SO 4 Also known as: battery acid , dipping acid, mattling acid, Terra Alba, oil of vitriol. \nSulfuric acid is a corrosive mineral strong acid. Although normally clear to slightly yellow, it may be dyed dark brown to alert people to its composition. Sulfuric acid causes serious chemical burns, as well as thermal burns from the exothermic dehydration reaction. The acid is used in lead batteries, drain cleaners, and chemical synthesis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:41:29.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
