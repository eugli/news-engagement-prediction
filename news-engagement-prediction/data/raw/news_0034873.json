A massive tomato is then thrown in Hitler’s face. \nAlthough the content of the short is obviously anti-Nazi, it’s stills of Donald Duck heiling that PewDiePie fans have seized upon. \nEducation for Death (1943) \nDisney also produced this rather terrifying anti-Nazi propaganda film, which shows children being trained from a young age to become Nazi soldiers. \nAgain, although this was an anti-Nazi wartime film, stills from this have been used by PewDiePie’s supporters as evidence of Disney freely referencing the Nazis in its own productions. \nSong of the South (1946) \nSong of the South is probably one of the most controversial films in history. \nIt was released just after the end of the Second World War, and right in the middle of the US’s racist Jim Crow era. \nDespite the horrors of racial segregation at the time, the film showed a black family gleefully devoting their lives to helping a small white boy. The animated Brer Rabbit character was also a racist caricature. \nBut perhaps the saddest thing about this film is that James Baskett, who played the part of main character Uncle Remus, wasn’t allowed to go to the film’s premier. \nWhile Disney has definitely produced some disturbing stuff in its past, you could argue that it’s a good thing Disney has come a long way since then. YouTube 'should have cut ties with PewDiePie sooner', says Jewish leader \nIndeed, it can only be a good thing that the company is now, finally, taking a hard line on racism and anti-Semitism in its associated acts. \nAnd there have been some quite disturbing anti-Semitic messages posted on Twitter and YouTube in support of PewDiePie, too, which weaken their argument. \nFor example, quite a few of his supporters have pointed to the fact that Disney’s current CEO Bob Iger is of a Jewish background – propagating the racist stereotype that there is a ‘Jewish conspiracy’. What were the Nazi messages in PewDiePie's videos? \nAugust 7, 2016: PewDiePie, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, begins his video with a swastika and other Nazi imagery, and uses a photo of Hitler as a segue between clips \nSeptember 24, 2016: In a video criticising YouTube policy, he shows a clip of Hitler giving a speech \nOctober 15, 2016: PewDiePie posts swastikas drawn by his fans \nDecember 8, 2016: PewDiePie wears a brown military uniform while watching a Hitler clip at the end of his video \nJanuary 11, 2017: He hires two Sri Lankan actors on Fiverr to do a dance and hold up a sign that says ‘Death to all Jews’ \nJanuary 14, 2017: PewDiePie plays the Nazi Party anthem before bowing to a swastika in a mock resurrection ritual \nJanuary 17, 2017: He posts a video saying ‘there’s a difference between a joke and actual, like, death to all Jews. If I made a video saying…’ at which point the camera cuts to a close-up of his face illuminated brightly – ‘Hey guys, PewDiePie here. Death to all Jews, I want you to say after me: Death to all Jews. And, you know, Hitler was right. I really opened my eyes to white power. And I think it is time we did something about this.’ \nJanuary 22, 2017: PewDiePie hires a Jesus Christ impersonator over Fiverr to say: ‘Hitler did absolutely nothing wrong.’ \nFebruary 5, 2016: At the start of the video he includes a brief Nazi salute, with a Hitler voice-over saying ‘Sieg Heil’ and text saying ‘Nazi Confirmed’.
