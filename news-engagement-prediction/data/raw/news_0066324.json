Appearing on Thursday's Loose Women , the 32-year-old revealed that she was having dinner with her husband Tom Fletcher and his bandmates at the time. \"It was Danny Jones' birthday and we were having a swanky dinner at a steak restaurant,\" she explained. Despite the urgency of the situation, the mother-of-two - who is busy promoting her new book, Happy Mum Happy Baby - went on to confess that she stayed behind and continued to enjoy her meal. \"I went to the loo and said I think my waters may have broken,\" she added. \"But I stayed and had my steak!\" \nGiovanna's appearance comes one day after she talked about suffering a miscarriage during herfirst pregnancy. The author, who has two sons with her husband, made the revelation during a live interview on BUILD . The TV personality explained: \"I fell pregnant very quickly and I had this thing in my head that it was just too easy. After being worried for so long that it wouldn't be easy it just happened. And then I miscarried not long after that and I think part of me felt that would happen, because I felt that it was too easy. Because I felt that I hadn't earned it. If that didn't happen I wouldn't have Buzz and Buzz will forever be my silver lining.\" A post shared by Giovanna Fletcher (@mrsgifletcher) on Feb 18, 2017 at 7:55am PST \nGiovanna gets help from Kimberley Walsh and Frankie Bridge for new mum video \nGiovanna admitted: \"When it comes to miscarriage I think we're all too scared to say something. I felt like I could never say anything to friends because people feel like it's contagious.\" She added: \"It's a really rubbish thing that happens and it happens to so many people. All you really want in that moment is a hug. You feel like your body has failed you and that's your first experience as a mother.\" \nTake a look at Tom and Giovanna Fletcher's romance \nAfter tying the knot in 2012, in a wedding exclusively covered by HELLO! magazine , Tom and Giovanna welcomed their first son Buzz in 2014 and then their second child Buddy in February 2016. Writing in her HELLO! blog , the TV star recently opened up about the struggles she faces as a working mother. \"I'm lucky that I work from home that I can get on with tasks when the boys go to sleep at night and that I love every single part of my hard-to-pinpoint-exactly-what-I-do job,\" she shared. \"That being said, I've been in desperate need for some family time. Not me time. Family time. For me, they are one and the same thing â€“ providing Tom has let me have a lie in every now and then to make up for the sleepless nights that having two delicious mummy's boys has given me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:04:45.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
