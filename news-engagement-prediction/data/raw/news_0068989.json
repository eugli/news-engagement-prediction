(Lauren Slagter | The Ann Arbor News) comments \nANN ARBOR, MI - City governments, law enforcement agencies, school districts and universities in Washtenaw County have recently reaffirmed a pledge to serve all people, regardless of immigration status. \nBut will that be enough to protect those who may be affected by the expanded deportation efforts outlined this week by the Department of Homeland Security? \nCitizens ask Ann Arbor to join resistance to Trump's deportation plans \nAnn Arbor immigration attorney Michael Carlin thinks it can help, although he said there is a still concern among immigrants. \n\"I think that will help provide some protection for some people,\" Carlin told The Ann Arbor News, referencing policies adopted by local government and other agencies that say their employees will not inquire about or share information on a person's immigration status unless compelled to by law. \nOn Monday, Feb. 20, the Department of Homeland Security issued memos on the implementation of President Donald J. Trump's executive orders related to border security and immigration enforcement. \nThe new approach to enforcement expands who is prioritized for deportation. \nPreviously, undocumented immigrants who posed threats to national security, border security and public safety were the top priority for deportation, which included people suspected of terrorist activities or who had been convicted of a felony. The next priority level included undocumented immigrants who were convicted of a misdemeanor offense or who had recently entered the country illegally. All other undocumented immigrants were deemed the lowest priority for deportation . \nYpsilanti mother and daughter deported Friday, leaving behind younger daughter \nNow, an undocumented immigrant who has committed any type of infraction, is suspected of committing a crime, has \"abused any program related to receipt of public benefits\" or is otherwise deemed a threat to public safety or national security is considered a priority for deportation, according to DHS. \n\"It basically says any crime of any sort, which could include jay walking or blocking a sidewalk,\" Carlin said. \"We don't really know exactly how Homeland Security is going to interpret their own memo.\" \nYpsilanti won't ask about immigration status under new ordinance \nCarlin pointed out the memos also bring a change in how expedited removal is enforced. Previously, expedited removal - which does not allow for the chance to appeal the deportation order in immigration court, Carlin said - was reserved for undocumented immigrants found close to a border within a couple weeks of entering the country illegally. \nThe new memos say expedited removal now can be applied to undocumented immigrants found anywhere in the country who cannot prove they've been U.S. residents for at least two years. \n\"I think it might be a good idea for people to carry with them some receipts or pay stubs to show they've been residents to avoid that,\" Carlin said, adding that his office has seen an increase in calls in the past month from immigrants worried about how Trump's new policies could affect them. \n\"There's a huge amount of concern in immigrant communities around the country and in Ann Arbor,\" Carlin said, adding that he's noticed increased immigration enforcement recently more in Detroit than the Ann Arbor area. \nThe memos do not call on the National Guard to assist with the deportation efforts - as was previously reported to be a possibility - and they do not change the legal protections offered for immigrants who were brought into the country illegally as children. \nUndocumented Ypsilanti valedictorian: 'I want a bright future' \nAbout 12 percent of Washtenaw County residents are immigrants, according to the Census Bureau's 2014 American Community Survey . Of the 43,838 local residents who are immigrants, approximately 41 percent are U.S. citizens and the other 59 percent includes legal residents and undocumented immigrants. \nWilliam Lopez, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan who studies the health effects of immigration home raids, said expanded deportation efforts will jeopardize the health of immigrant families and create an environment where law enforcement could target Latino communities. \n\"Frankly, this is going to be devastating for families. This is going to drive families underground to avoid all kinds of services, all kinds of public places,\" said Lopez, who also is involved in the Washtenaw Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant Rights. \nDACA immigration policy subject of UM panel discussion \nMany families are \"mixed status,\" Lopez said, meaning some family members are citizens or legal residents and some aren't. Those families will be hesitant to go to the emergency room, apply for government assistance programs or cooperate with the police, for example, for fear of exposing a relative's immigration status, Lopez said. \n\"We're curbing their ability to live happy, healthy lives,\" he said. \nLike Carlin, Lopez also thinks local policies downplaying immigration status are helpful. He encouraged managers at all types of businesses to become familiar with what the law requires in terms of inquiring about someone's immigration status and then sharing that information with federal agencies. \nThe City of Ann Arbor currently has a policy that prohibits public servants from seeking information about someone's immigration status, and the city council now is considering an ordinance to the same effect. There is some concern that the city could lose federal funding if it's deemed a \"sanctuary city.\" \nRead Ann Arbor schools' resolution regarding immigration \nThe Ypsilanti City Council unanimously passed a similar ordinance on Jan. 24. The Washtenaw County Sheriff's Office previously told The Ann Arbor News it does not enforce immigration law. \nUM President Mark Schlissel stated his support for international and undocumented students following Trump's executive order on immigration, and UM police do not inquire about or record people's immigration status when performing their duties. Eastern Michigan University police follow similar practices, President James Smith said in a statement . \n'We're not invisible,' organizer of 'Day Without Immigrants' rally says \nAnn Arbor Public Schools board of education passed a resolution on Feb. 8 saying all students, regardless of immigration status, have a right to a free and appropriate public education. The resolution also said Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers and other law enforcement officers need the superintendent's permission to enter a school. \nWhen people across the country observed a \"day without immigrants\" on Feb. 16 in protest of Trump's immigration policy, about 300 AAPS students beyond the typical absentee rate missed school that day, said Superintendent Jeanice Swift.
