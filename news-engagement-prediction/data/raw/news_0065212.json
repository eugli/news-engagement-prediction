What diet are you talking about? Majority of us strive to achieve a slim build in a number of ways. Becoming slim has time and again become the \"standard\" of looking good. Just look at the many posts with the hashtag #fitnessgoals on Instagram and you'll see what we mean. In Dubai, getting fit is easy because of the community's focus on being healthy. This is because most of us here enjoy eating out and socializing. It's human nature. As utopian as it may sound, there is one big 'but' however. Despite the many fitness groups , activities, and running tracks here in Dubai, it's still difficult to get fit. Why you might want to ask? Here are some reasons why we think you're having a hard time shedding those kilos. You eat out... a lot Okay, okay, Friday is excusable, but if you eat out even on weekdays then that poses a problem. Try investing a couple of minutes after work to cook your own meals. By cooking, you can take full control of what's in your meal. You're don't go for a run In this amazing weather even! The weather is great for a leisurely run down Dubai's many running paths. Running paths are everywhere. If you want a challenge why not run down Jumeirah Open Beach's track and go all the way to Burj Al Arab? Here's a list of fabulous running tracks around town. Delivery is your best buddy We're all guilty of having food delivered and it's well-deserved since it's efficient. However, like everything in life, have food delivered in moderation and you'll be fine. Try packing some fruit when you can for something wholesome. You haven't gone car-free... ever It can be a bit inconvenient at first, but going car-free has some impact on your fitness. You not only save a few dirhams on petrol, you also get to walk a fair distance to get to your destination. How's that for cardio? You haven't tried out some free activities There are a huge number of fitness groups in Dubai. Frequent runners like the Dubai Creek Striders are an example. Other sports such as cycling, hiking, and tennis should set you up. There are yoga groups in parks around Dubai and exercises groups usually on the beach. If that's not your cup of tea, there's always the volleyball courts on the beach.
