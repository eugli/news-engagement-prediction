His work was published recently by the Astrophysical Journal. Ideas on gas-giant planet formation take shape March 22, 2006 \nRocky planets such as Earth and Mars are born when small particles smash together to form larger, planet-sized clusters in a planet-forming disk, but researchers are less sure about how gas-giant planets such as Jupiter and ... What kinds of stars form rocky planets? December 3, 2015 \nAs astronomers continue to find more and more planets around stars beyond our own Sun, they are trying to discover patterns and features that indicate what types of planets are likely to form around different kinds of stars. ... Planetary systems can form around binary stars January 10, 2006 \nNew theoretical work shows that gas-giant planet formation can occur around binary stars in much the same way that it occurs around single stars like the Sun. The work is presented today by Dr. Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution’s ... Newly discovered celestial object defies categories January 8, 2014 \nAn object discovered by astrophysicists at the University of Toronto (U of T) nearly 500 light years away from the Sun may challenge traditional understandings about how planets and stars form. How planets like Jupiter form October 28, 2016 \nYoung giant planets are born from gas and dust. Researchers of ETH Zürich and the Universities of Zürich and Bern simulated different scenarios relying on the computing power of the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre ... Recommended for you Tune your radio: Galaxies sing when forming stars February 21, 2017 \nA team led from the Instituto   has found the most precise way ever to measure the rate at which stars form in galaxies using their radio emission at 1-10 Gigahertz frequency range. New data about two distant asteroids give a clue to the possible 'Planet Nine' February 21, 2017 \nThe dynamical properties of these asteroids, observed spectroscopiccally for the first time using the Gran Telescopio CANARIAS, suggest a possible common origin and give a clue to the existence of a planet beyond Pluto, the ... Prediction: More gas-giants will be found orbiting Sun-like stars February 21, 2017 \nNew planetary formation models from Carnegie's Alan Boss indicate that there may be an undiscovered population of gas giant planets orbiting around Sun-like stars at distances similar to those of Jupiter and Saturn. His work ... Data from Mars probe suggests possibility of proto-ring development February 21, 2017 \n(Phys.org)—A pair of researchers with the Physical Research Laboratory in India studying data sent back from NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) probe has found possible evidence of the development of ... The brightest, furthest pulsar in the universe February 21, 2017 \nESA's XMM-Newton has found a pulsar – the spinning remains of a once-massive star – that is a thousand times brighter than previously thought possible. Scientists readying to create first image of a black hole February 20, 2017 \n(Phys.org)—A team of researchers from around the world is getting ready to create what might be the first image of a black hole. The project is the result of collaboration between teams manning radio receivers around the ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:55:51.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
