(The 77D is essentially the replacement to the Rebel T6s/EOS 760D.) But despite sitting below the 80D in the lineup, it shares that more advanced model's 24.2MP sensor with Dual Pixel autofocus and adds an updated Digic 7 processor to the mix. Users opting to focus using the optical viewfinder will be greeted with a 45-point all-cross-type AF system and 7650-pixel RGB+IR metering system, which work together for better accuracy and subject recognition. \nRounding out the package is an ISO range of 100-25600, continuous 6 fps burst shooting with autofocus (4.5 fps when using Live View), 1080/60p video capture and wireless connectivity featuring NFC and Bluetooth LE. \nUsers opting for the 77D over the T7i will gain built-in interval and bulb timers, greater custom controls including an AF-On button, a top LCD panel and an eye sensor to shut off the rear LCD when the camera is raised for shooting. \nThe Canon EOS 77D is scheduled to be available in April 2017 for $899.99 body only, $1049.00 with the new EF-S 18-55mm F4-5.6 IS STM lens and $1,499.00 with the 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 IS USM lens. \nPress release: NEW CANON EOS REBEL T7i AND EOS 77D CAMERAS POSSESS STUNNING AUTOFOCUS CAPABILITIES \nNew DSLR Additions are Joined by New Compact EF-S Lens and Canon’s First-Ever Remote Utilizing Bluetooth® Technology 3 \nMELVILLE, N.Y., February 14, 2017 – Developed and designed to meet the varying needs of entry-level and advanced amateur photographers, Canon U.S.A., Inc., a leader in digital imaging solutions, today announced two new additions to the celebrated EOS system – the EOS Rebel T7i DSLR camera, which adds to the popular Rebel series of entry-level DSLR cameras, and the EOS 77D DLSR camera, which represents a new category of cameras for advanced amateur photographers. Canon also introduced today the new EF-S 18-55mm f/4-5.6 IS STM lens and Wireless Remote Control BR-E1, as well as added functionality for the Canon Connect Station CS100. “In what marks the 30th year since the introduction of the Canon EOS System, the announcement today of these two new DSLR cameras exhibits Canon’s commitment to providing our customers with the tools they need to grow their passion for capturing the best possible pictures of the moments in time that mean the most to them, or inspire them to one day shoot professionally,” said Yuichi Ishizuka, president and COO, Canon U.S.A. \nFocused on Innovation \nThe EOS Rebel T7i and EOS 77D both feature an optical viewfinder with a 45-point All Cross-type AF system * to help enable more precise focusing. In live view mode, both cameras utilize Canon’s Dual Pixel CMOS AF to deliver the world’s fastest AF focusing speed of 0.03 seconds. 1 This technical achievement allows users to find their subject, focus accurately, and capture the shot more quickly than ever before. Both models also have built-in Wi-Fi® 2 , NFC 3 and Bluetooth® 4 technology for easy transfer of images. \nIn addition to the focusing enhancements, common features of the EOS Rebel T7i and EOS 77D cameras include: Optical Viewfinder with a 45-point All Cross-type AF System * Fast and accurate Dual Pixel CMOS AF with Phase-detection 24.2 Megapixel CMOS (APS-C) Sensor DIGIC 7 Image Processor, ISO 100–25600 Built-in Wi-Fi® 2 , NFC 3 and Bluetooth® 4 technology Vari-angle Touch Screen, 3.0-inch LCD Movie Electronic IS High-speed Continuous Shooting at up to 6.0 frames per second (fps) \nCanon EOS Rebel T7i Camera \nThe EOS Rebel T7i is the first camera in the EOS Rebel series with a 45-point, all cross-type AF system * within the Optical Viewfinder. It is also the first in the series with Dual Pixel CMOS AF with Phase-detection and the first with a DIGIC 7 Image Processor. Creative filters for both still images and video will allow users to customize the look and feel of their content in new and imaginative ways. \nWhen designing the new EOS Rebel T7i, Canon took into consideration feedback from entry-level photographers who expressed interest in learning to go beyond the program mode of a DSLR camera. Users will now be able to see on-screen how switching modes on the mode dial or tweaking settings can alter the image they are about to capture, guiding photographers on their way to capturing more compelling images, such as ones with a shallower depth-of-field or being able to give moving-subjects a frozen or flowing look. \nThe Canon EOS Rebel T7i is scheduled to be available in April 2017 for an estimated retail price $749.99 ** for the body only, $899.99 ** with the new EF-S 18-55mm f/4-5.6 IS STM lens and $1,299.00 ** with the EF-S 18-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens respectively.
