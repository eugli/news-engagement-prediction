When I was your age, I got my first guitar. I brought it home. I realized, it wasn't about how well you played it, but how good you looked doing it. So I got in front of the mirror and I tried some different poses.\" \nHe then struck some iconic moves in the ultimate rock and roll lesson. \nSpringsteen has been making fans happy down under. On Feb. 13, the singer held a private meeting with Adam Brooker , a fan who has a severe intellectual disability and learned to speak through Springsteen's lyrics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:12:40.492+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
