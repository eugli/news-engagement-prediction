GETTY The EU has already swung into action but Mr Clegg repeatedly denied it \nHe told students: \"The United Kingdom is out, and then crucially what the European Union and what the UK do while they are separate. \n\"If we were to revisit this in 40 years time and in that meantime we have turned ourselves into some bargain basement off shore Dubai economy and the European Union has created an army then clearly it will be more tricky\". \nIn November last year Express.co.uk revealed the EU voted to ratify the creation of a continent wide army that will be up and running this year. GETTY The new EU army is top of the agenda \nAt the time the EU claimed it needed to make a position of European Defence Minister to roll out its army because of Brexit. \nTheir report stated: \"At a time when public support for the EU is being called into question in some Member States, defence and security is an area where the individual and collective benefits of more Europe can be easily demonstrated, especially regarding the likely challenges to EU’s standing as a strategic actor following Brexit.\" \nThe report demanded the EU bankroll the initiative with an immediate £76million for 'preparatory action on EU defence research' starting in 2017. GETTY Clegg went out on the campaign trail again last year \nUkip defence spokesman Bill Etheridge said Nick Clegg had been \"caught with his pants on fire.\" \nHe said: \"UKIP and Nigel Farage warned about the threat of an EU Army which was dismissed by Clegg as a dangerous fantasy. \n\"Even he now admits we were right all along and an EU military structure is actually a dangerous reality. \n\"This is another example of the Remainer establishment being caught out lying just like we saw with economic forecasts, companies saying they would leave and the four horsemen of the apocalypse roaming the land.\" \nMr Clegg also confirmed for the first time last night that he has been blacklisted from entering Russia.
