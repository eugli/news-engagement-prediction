Paralysed: Ben Smith was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer just before Christmas (Ben Smith) \nHe has also performed sets at some of London’s top nightclubs including Scala, Bungalow 8 and the O2 Forum in Kentish Town. \nIn November, Mr Smith released his first record after he produced Represent to the Fullest with Baltimore rapper Ill Conscious. \nBut despite his rising star status, tragedy struck when Mr Smith was rushed to hospital with unbearable pain later diagnosed as cancer. \nHe said: “As you can imagine it was a massive shock. I felt like I was on the path to a really successful career and then this happened to me. An urgent fundraiser has raised nearly £9,000 to support Mr Smith through his cancer battle (Ben Smith) \n“I may never be able to walk again but it affects everyone differently. Maybe with some rehabilitation I can.\" \nAnd despite his debilitating illness Mr Smith said he was confident he can continue his career. \n“Music is my life whether I’m performing or just at home and even if I don’t have the full use of my legs I’m confident I will be behind the set again,” he said. \nA fundraising page was launched last month to help Mr Smith cover accommodation, disability adaptions, equipment, care and living costs. Top DJ: Mr Smith recently released his first record before he was struck down with the disease (Ben Smith) \nSo far, nearly £9,000 has been raised in just over two weeks towards a £10,000 target set by Mr Smith’s brother Matt, another London-based DJ.
