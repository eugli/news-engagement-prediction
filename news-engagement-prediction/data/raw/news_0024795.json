Dubai-based e-commerce company Gizmaze.com has launched Mesuit, a phone without a screen that converts iPhone 6 / 6s / 6 Plus / 6s Plus into a dual sim phone and allows users full access to Android along with iOS.Approved by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of the UAE, Mesuit will be available at www.gizmaze.com from Sunday, February 12, 2017, for Dh699 (iPhone 6 and 6s) and Dh749 (iPhone 6 Plus and 6s Plus).iPhone users can slip their phones into the casing of a Mesuit phone and benefit from being able to use the free apps on Android using the same iPhone. Mesuit has all the features of a phone except a screen so users can use a second SIM card, eliminating the use of two phones, doubling up power to the phone and adding 16GB additional storage capacity.Mahesh Kumar, Managing Partner of Gizmaze.com, says: \"This is the first launch of this marvellous and ingenious product worldwide outside China. iPhone users will have the opportunity to choose not to choose. Its sleek classy design and innumerable advantages make it irresistible to iPhone users. We have stringent testing processes in place and take full responsibility of product performance.\"Gizmaze.com says carrying a Mesuit with an iPhone is like having two phones without the extra weight. Both phones are charged simultaneously with a single charger, and Mesuit's MTK 8 core CPU helps lower the power consumption while adding to the battery life of the phone, the firm claims.
