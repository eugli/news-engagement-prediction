The team who help them say to me, ‘You know it’s worthwhile when the calf comes in and it’s been screaming all night, screaming for its mother. \n“And then gradually they rehabilitate and 10 years later go back into the wild. \n“An elephant never forgets. Elephants laugh, cry and play practical jokes on each other, like humans. They are extraordinary animals. But, because of the ivory trade, humans are their hell.” \nDespite her horrific start in life, Zongoloni is one of the lucky ones. Her mother had survived for almost a week with a poacher’s bullet in her leg, which had shattered the bone. Out in the bush with her new elephant family (Photo: The David Sheldrick Wildlife) \nVets treated her but, with the bullet still embedded, they were not optimistic she would recover. Sadly, they were right and she had to be put down. \nThe elephant’s plight reduced the rescuers to tears. But at least they were able to save Zongoloni. After a 90-minute flight and a life-saving drip, she was taken to the orphanage, where she is now one of 200 calves. \nThe DSWT rescues and hand-rears milk-dependent orphaned baby elephants with the aim of returning them to the wild when they are fully grown. \nWith the help of a pioneering milk formula – developed by the charity’s founder, Dame Daphne Sheldrick – hundreds of animals have been saved. \nSo far, the DSWT has released more than 100 elephants, who have had 24 babies between them, back into the wild. Kenyan-born Dame Daphne and her late husband, David Sheldrick, spent decades raising and rehabilitating wild animals. \nAfter David’s death in 1977, Dame Daphne set up the trust in his memory. But it faces an uphill struggle. Ivory poachers killed 100,000 African elephants between 2011 and 2014 alone, according the most recent study on illegal kills by Colorado State University. Presenter Nicky Campbell is doing all he can to help (Photo: Getty) \nIn 2011, roughly one in every 12 African elephants was killed by a poacher. \nThe demand for ivory, mainly in China and other parts of Asia, has fuelled black-market activity. African elephants are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, while Asian elephants are already classed as endangered. \nIf the poaching continues, Nicky fears his four teenage daughters’ children will grow up in a world where they won’t be able to see elephants in the wild. \nHe says: “I am really looking forward to a time in the future when their children live on a planet that has elephants in the wild, wandering over hundreds of hundreds of miles, finding watering holes, staying as families and living their beautiful lives.” \n“I want them to be around when my grandchildren are old. That is what I am frightened for. When we destroy the natural world, when we destroy ­elephants in the wild, how will we look at ourselves in the mirror? \n“We have to get into a situation where people don’t look at an ivory antique and think it’s beautiful – they have to instead have a visual of a baby elephant guarding her dead mother. That’s what I see when I see ivory – grief and ugliness,” he adds.
