Sebelius and Little Sisters of the Poor Home for the Aged v. Burwell \n\nBoth cases had to do with the Obamacare mandate that employee insurance coverage provide all approved contraceptives. Gorsuch’s rulings seemed instructive; he noted that would require the objecting businesses to “underwrite payments for drugs or devices that can have the effect of destroying a fertilized human egg.”\nGorsuch’s opinions favoring the owners of Hobby Lobby craft stores and nonprofit religious group called Little Sisters of the Poor took the same sort of broad reading of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as the Supreme Court’s conservative majority.\nIn Gorsuch’s words, the law “doesn’t just apply to protect popular religious beliefs: it does perhaps its most important work in protecting unpopular religious beliefs, vindicating this nation’s long-held aspiration to serve as a refuge of religious tolerance.”\n\nGutierrez-Brizuela v. Lynch \nIn this case, Gorsuch called for reconsideration of a long-standing Supreme Court decision that is little known to the public but vitally important to the functioning of the federal government. \nSo-called “ Chevron deference” means that courts should grant wide leeway to executive branch agencies when they reasonably interpret acts of Congress that are ambiguous. Some conservatives have said that gives too much power to the executive branch. Liberals are alarmed that would be a way for courts to routinely rule against the party in power.\nIn this immigration case, Gorsuch said the deference has gone too far.\nIt allows “executive bureaucracies to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers’ design,” Gorsuch wrote. “Maybe the time has come to face the behemoth.”\nRead the decisions and two speeches here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:05:49.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
