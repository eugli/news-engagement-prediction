The first man shown is wearing a red shirt and an Atlanta Falcons cap. The second man shown is wearing a Falcons sweatshirt and has his faced covered with a black-and-white bandanna.\nThe man in the bandanna matches the would-be robber in the police report, described as wearing a red hoodie and a mask covering his face. Witnesses said he was in his early 20s and about 5-foot-8-inches tall.\nGwinnett man pleads guilty to used car odometer scam in Virginia\nCops seek ‘armed, extremely dangerous’ carjacking trio\nThe man in the bandanna walked into the store shortly before closing around midnight. He pointed a gun at a cashier and told her to give him $100, according to the police report. The cashier began to cry, and another employee came to the front to see what was happening.\nThe second employee told the man they would not give him any money, and she picked up the phone to call the police. The man bolted from the store as soon as the woman picked up the phone.\nWhen police responded shortly after midnight, they found a Falcons hoodie, a pair of gloves and a BB gun on the ground near where the man had been seen fleeing.\nNorcross police believe the man in the Falcons cap acted as the lookout for the attempted robbery. He entered the store before the masked man, “surveilled the place, bought some items” and had a conversation with the clerk that indicated he may be a lookout, according to Sgt. Robert Braud.\nAnyone with information related to this case can call the Norcross Police Department’s anonymous tip line at 770-448-6457, or their main number, 770-448-2111.\n ", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/gwinnettnewsnow/?fref=nf", "https://www.instagram.com/gwinnettnewsnow/", "https://twitter.com/GwinnettNewsNow"], "published": "2017-02-23T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T13:28:26.578+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
