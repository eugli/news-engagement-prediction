His small left lung collapsed, his skin melted and he went into a state of septic shock, as blood poisoning took over his body. \nLaura, who used to work in a bank to care for him, recalled how, at his sickest, doctors had to physically stitch a breathing tube to the inside of Xander’s mouth, because his skin was melting away so rapidly. Xander due to go home (Photo: PA Real Life) \nShockingly, it was the only way the tube – which enabled him to breathe while his lung was incapacitated – would stay secure. \n“Touching his skin was like swiping an iPhone,” Laura, from Hawaii, said. “The lightest touch would see layers of it come off in your hand. \n“He was blistering, peeling, burning from the inside out. It was devastating.” \nHer son’s ordeal started with a simple fever, common in children. \nLaura and her husband, military worker, Ronnie, 42, were relatively unconcerned and fed him Motrin to soothe him. \nThe fever vanished, but a few hours later it returned, worse than before.

Finally, after being pumped full of antibiotics, he started to respond to treatment and come round. \nFinally, more than a month after developing the fever, he woke up. \nBut he still had a mountain to climb. \n“He could barely lift his head,” Laura continued. “He’d loved school, but couldn’t go anymore. \n“He was still in hospital and would beg to be back in class, learning maths, which is his favourite subject.” \nIn August, 2014, finally allowed home, he was delighted to be reunited with his brothers, Jaiden, now 13, and Tyce, now four. \n“He worked really hard to recover,” his mum said. “He’d say, ‘Can I please go to school just for an hour.’” \nNow, nearly three years after his ordeal started, Xander is much better. \nBut the long-term impact of his illness has been significant. \n“It’s been a difficult transition for him,” said Laura. “He doesn’t produce salvia anymore and the tiny hairs on the inside of his lungs have gone. This means he can’t effectively cough and clear any mucas or fluid. Xander in hospital (Photo: PA Real Life) \n“He’s effectively blind, whereas once he had 20/20 sight. \n“He is photophobic, so can’t stand bright lights, and needs sunglasses all the time. \n“He’s been bullied for this, but we are full of admiration for our brave boy and think he looks cool.” \nA spokesman from Johnson and Johnson, who make Motrin, said: “As the makers of MOTRIN® (ibuprofen) products, we are committed to providing consumers with safe and effective over-the-counter medicines. \n“Over decades and millions of uses, ibuprofen has proven safe and effective when used as directed. \n\"We are sympathetic to the pain and hardships suffered by anyone affected by Stevens-Johnson Syndrome.” \nThe family were supported by charities the Kapiolani Health Foundation and the Stevens Johnson Syndrome Foundation.
