You are loyal to some religious leader in the Middle East and his rulings. Not to the Australian constitution and our democratic system of government. \n“Sharia law is nothing more than an anti-democratic cancer that doesn’t belong in a free society and fails to respect the basic human rights of women, gay people and the Jewish people.” . \nMs Lambie “simplified” the meaning of sharia law, despite the fact that “like most Australians I’m not an expert”. \n“It is religious, criminal and civil law all rolled into one code,” Ms Lambie said. \n“It has no separation of powers and it automatically makes religious figures the politician, the judge, the jury and even in some cases, the executioner. \nShe listed “six, obvious points” about sharia law, including: \n1. “It is not Australian law.” \n2. “Support for sharia law is an obvious sign of radicalisation and terrorists are fighting to the death to force it on the rest of the world.” \n3. “Sharia law is anti-democratic. You show me a successful democracy in the Middle East.” \n4. “Sharia law imposes the death penalty on people, just for being gay.” \n5. “Sharia law imposes the death penalty on women who are unfaithful to their husbands.” \n6. “Sharia law denies the right of the Jewish people to live in peace in Israel.” \nMs Abdel-Magied expressed her “frustration” last night over the fact “people talk about Islam without knowing anything about it and they’re willing to completely negate any of my rights as a human being, a woman, as a person with agency, simply because they have an idea about what my face is about”. \n“Excuse me, Islam to me is the most feminist religion, right. We got equal rights well before the Europeans,” she said. \n“We don’t take our husbands’ last names … We were given the right to own land, their property. “The fact people go around dissing in my face without knowing anything about it and want to chuck me out of a country …” \nMs Lambie responded: “We have one law in this country and it is the Australian law. It is not sharia law, not in this country. Not in my day.” \nMs Abdel-Magied, who explained that she was born in Sudan and moved to Brisbane as a toddler, said sharia meant following the law of the land on which you are on, adding: “You don’t know anything about my religion. You’re talking about stuff you don’t know anything about.” \n- News.com.au has contacted Jacqui Lambie and Yassmin Abdel-Magied for comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:12:44.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
