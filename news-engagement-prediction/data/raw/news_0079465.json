Some in line reported waiting four hours to get into the building on Canfield between Cass and Second. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Just look around the place: \nThe record factory -- officially dubbed Third Man Pressing -- sits at the back of the long and narrow retail-performance area of Third Man Records. The manufacturing floor would be a novelty of its own, just for its business of putting recorded music to vinyl. But White has added extra off-kilter touches -- painting the spotless 10,000-square-foot room in searing yellows and pitch blacks, and staffing the place with workers wearing identical blue coveralls. They operate eight new presses imported from Germany that can pump out 5,000 albums a day. On Saturday, they produced colored vinyl -- discs that were red and yellow and even clear. \nThird Man Records celebrated the opening of Third Man Pressing, the 10,000-square-foot vinyl production facility in Midtown Detroit on Saturday, Feb. 25, 2017.

In the afternoon, there were rousing live readings from a stage, and a performance by the Craig Brown Band. \nThird Man Pressing, debuting to the public, fit nicely with the rest of the building, where Hickling in mirthful fashion remarked that the counter-workers who were selling the place’s freshly pressed wax resembled Oompa-Loompas straight from the Chocolate Factory. The saleswomen wore tunics in the omnipresent yellow, dotted with black squares. Their hair was the hue of lavender or scarlet or as blue-green as cotton candy. \nHickling, pleased with what she was seeing, said she and two of her bandmates withstood the line outside and the 37-degree chill “just for the spectacle of it. It’s a lot of fun. ... I think Jack White is bringing a lot of excitement back into the experience of music.” \nA collection of limited-edition vinyl records by Detroit artists was available for purchase during opening day at Third Man Pressing vinyl production facility at Third Man Records in Detroit on Saturday, Feb. 25, 2017. (Photo: John Froelich, Special to the Free Press) \nBen Blackwell, who called himself a “psychedelic stooge” who oversees vinyl operations for Third Man, said people started lining up Thursday night for Saturday’s door-opening. From morning to at least mid-afternoon, the line was a block long. Sixteen-year-old Brody Britton and his friend Michael Livingston traveled about an hour from Hartland to be there. \n“Because we love the music,” Britton said. “We are huge music fans.” \nSaid Livingston: “We’re probably the only two people in our school that own record-players.” \nYet, this wasn’t a young-people-only event. The line held plenty of those with enough seasoning to have experienced vinyl the first time around. \n“With vinyl,” Blackwell said, “there’s an allure, something psychological that draws people into it.” \nThird Man Records celebrated the opening of Third Man Pressing, the 10,000-square-foot vinyl production facility located behind Third Man Records in Midtown Detroit on Saturday, Feb. 25, 2017. (Photo: John Froelich, Special to the Free Press) \nThis coming from a man with his own, well, eclectic tastes. Blackwell, who said he is a nephew of White’s, claimed his first vinyl record was a Weird Al Yankovic “Eat it” 45 from the Harmony House on Mack Avenue in Grosse Pointe Woods. This was before vinyl was prematurely ruled dead by the emergence of the compact disc. \nInterest in the older format is rising: Global sales could hit $1 billion this year, the Free Press has reported. Third Man Pressing hopes to capitalize, and its menu Saturday included special-edition LPs from bands like Detroit’s own White Stripes, the Stooges and the MC5. \nThe people outside and inside Third Man Pressing on Saturday apparently couldn’t get enough. \nAfter emerging from an exit, one man could be overheard exclaiming to his companion: \n“I got the very last Stooges. The very last!” \nCompanion: “The guy behind you was pissed .” \nThey walked away, past the people still standing in line, laughing. \nContact Jim Schaefer: 313-223-4542 or jschaefer@freepress.com.
