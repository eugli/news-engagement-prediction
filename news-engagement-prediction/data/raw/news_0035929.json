The fans were amazing, all through the game. They’re a top quality side, drew with Chelsea last week, it’s amazing. [Did we have] belief? Massively, we didn’t come to draw, we came to win the game. Crazy, a non-league side in the quarter-finals in modern football, it’s unheard of.”\nThe Lincoln manager, Danny Cowley, could barely believe what his team had achieved after the final whistle. “Last eight of the FA Cup - it sounds really good,” Cowley said. “I’m lost for words.”\nIt was therefore initially left to his brother Nicky, the assistant manager, to sum up family feelings. “We said it was a one in 100 chance and we had to believe it was going to be that one opportunity. Thankfully for us it was,” he said. “Incredible, a fantastic day. You wake up in the morning and you hope it’s going to be that day. It’s just brilliant for all the supporters, all the players, their families, directors, it’s fantastic.”\nThe manager managed to find some words when recalling his reaction to Raggett’s goal. Raggett’s winner came after a Sam Habergham corner was headed back across goal by Luke Waterfall. Burnley keeper Tom Heaton pushed the ball away but it had already crossed the line, with referee Graham Scott immediately awarding the goal.\nBurnley 0-1 Lincoln City: FA Cup fifth round – as it happened Read more \n“From the view we had it was difficult to see whether it was over the line or not,” said the boss. “We needed the referee to point his arm in the direction of the centre spot and when that happened it was a fantastic feeling.”\nThe Burnley midfielder Joey Barton could face an FA sanction for his involvement in at least one incident. Just after the hour Barton appeared to deliberately tread on the boot of Lincoln striker Matt Rhead, with the pair trying to wind each other up, but it was not seen by the match officials.\nAround 10 minutes later Barton appeared to push Lincoln’s Terry Hawkridge immediately before Jon Flanagan shoved Hawkridge to the deck. Barton was booked for his push while Flanagan was not punished.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T22:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T18:02:13.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
