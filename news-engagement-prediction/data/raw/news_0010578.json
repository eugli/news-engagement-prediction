That is why I want 2017 to be the year of delivery because these are the things that can spur economic growth and also ensure the wellbeing of the people,” he said. \nNajib also wants civil servants to break away from being territorial and having silo mentality. \n“So to ensure we reach the effectiveness and delivery that I have been talking about, we need to work together with each other as a team,” he added. \nWhile the Treasury must ensure that allocations and cash flow were enough to carry out projects and plans, agencies must also look at their procedures and processes and identify what could be further improved. \nUnnecessary limitations, conditions and red tape must be re­­moved so the Government’s delivery system remains efficient, Najib said. \n“We need to ensure that hard work that we put in results in good outcome. \n“This is not just a reminder to all of you but also to myself. We must make right decisions and continue to be committed to deliver and serve,” he concluded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:38:47.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
