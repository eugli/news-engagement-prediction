Indiana authorities want to talk to the man in connection with the killings of two teenage girls. He was photographed on the trail system around the time Liberty German and Abigail Williams were dropped off Monday to go hiking. (Indiana State Police via AP)\nDELPHI, Ind. (AP) — One of two teenage girls killed along a northern Indiana hiking trail last week used her cellphone beforehand to capture video of a man police now consider the main suspect and recorded a male voice saying \"down the hill,\" authorities said Wednesday.\nIndiana State Police played a clip of the man's voice during a news conference at which officials appealed for more tips from the public and announced that $41,000 in reward money had been raised.\nThe audio came from 14-year-old Liberty German's cellphone, Capt. David Bursten said. Liberty also captured a grainy image released by police last week of a man walking near the hiking trail outside Delphi about the time she and 13-year-old Abigail Williams disappeared Feb. 13, Bursten said.\nThe girls' bodies were found the next day in a rugged wooded area off the trail, some 60 miles northwest of Indianapolis.\nBursten said investigators aren't certain the voice was that of the man in the photograph whom investigators are calling the main suspect in the deaths. That man hasn't been identified and no arrests have been made.\n© (John Terhune/Journal & Courier via AP) Capt. David Bursten of the Indiana State Police is joined by law enforcement officials from numerous departments to provide the latest details of the investigation into the murders of Liberty German and Abigail Williams on Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2017, at Delphi United Methodist Church in Delphi, Ind. German, 14, Williams, 13, were murdered last week while hiking the High Bridge Trail just east of Delphi. Police released an audio clip believed to be that of the girl's killer taken from Liberty German's cellphone. Officials declined to release more information about how the girls were killed and what else Liberty might have recorded on her phone.\n\"She had the presence of mind to have the phone on and to capture video as well as audio,\" Bursten said.\nGreg Massa, assistant special agent in charge of the FBI's Indianapolis Division, said as many as 20 FBI agents have been assisting state and local investigators.\nMassa said investigators haven't found any connection between the girls' deaths and any other homicides.\nThe girls' bodies were found about a quarter-mile from an abandoned railroad bridge that's part of the trail system where the teens had planned to hike during a day off school.\nBursten said while the quality of the audio clip is poor, investigators believed someone could recognize the voice of the person who was with the girls.\n\"One of two things happened. It was a chance encounter — that's possible. Don't think it's likely, but it's possible,\" Bursten said. \"Or that person knew that they were going to be there. That's possible as well.\"\n__\nThe police tip line for the case is: 844-459-5786.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.in.gov/isp/files/Delphi_male_voice_loop.mp3"], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:24:30.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
