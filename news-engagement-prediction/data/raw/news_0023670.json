PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 13:00, Sat, Feb 11, 2017 GETTY Brian Hayes has lashed out at the EU for its bailout 'surveillance' \nBrian Hayes has accused the Commission of “excessive surveillance” due to its bi-annual visits by ministers to inspect the Republic of Ireland’s finances. \nThese six-monthly “missions” ensure the country continues to repay bailout funds - but Mr Hayes believes this is a waste of resources considering Ireland’s now-booming economy. \nWith European Union visits planned every six months until 2031, the MEP believes the EU should put its efforts towards a more worthwhile cause - such as preparing for Brexit.

For a country with the highest growth in the EU, it seems perverse that we have twice yearly reports assessing our economic and financial situation, along with regular missions.
