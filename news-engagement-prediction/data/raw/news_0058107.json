Turnbull says Trump gave him personal assurance of refugee resettlement deal Read more \nOn Wednesday Labor seized on the concession and questioned whether the arrangement was a “done deal”. \nIn September, Australia committed to take refugees from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador now in camps in Costa Rica. In November, the Turnbull government announced that the US would take refugees in offshore detention on Manus Island and Nauru. The government has repeatedly denied the commitments are a quid pro quo. \nBut Dutton has now linked the two after the Trump administration committed to honour the deal but emphasised that under its policy of “extreme vetting” it is not obliged to take any particular refugee or the full 1,250 people. \nDutton said Australia “wouldn’t take anyone [from Costa Rica] until we had assurances that people are going to go off Nauru and Manus”. \nAsked if this constituted a quid pro quo, he replied: “We want an outcome in relation to Nauru and Manus.” \n“It was beneficial to the US, and it was beneficial to us,” Dutton said, using the singular to describe an arrangement the government had previously characterised as two separate commitments. \nAlthough the minister denied the arrangement amounted to “a people swap deal” he conceded: “I don’t have any problem with that characterisation if people want to put that.” \nThe immigration minister said the government had learned from the Gillard government’s proposed Malaysia solution. “We accepted all the people from Malaysia and not one person went from Australia – we’re not going to be sucked into that sort of silly outcome,” he said, without acknowledging the Coalition’s role in blocking the policy . \nOn Wednesday shadow immigration minister, Richard Marles, told Sky News that Dutton had now made it clear the deals were a quid pro quo, despite Turnbull’s denials. \n“Everyone knew it was a deal and last night … Peter Dutton belled the cat, making clear Costa Rica was contingent on the US honouring the deal.” \nMarles said the government had characterised the US arrangement as “such a done deal … but if you look at Peter Dutton’s comments, clearly he is putting a question mark on this. So is this going ahead or not? Is it enough of a done deal that we can be certain that people will be taken off Manus or Nauru or not?” \nDutton said the Australian government “appreciates the support of President Trump” for accepting the arrangement and “takes the US at its word”. US could resettle zero refugees from Manus and Nauru and still 'honour' deal Read more \nHe said the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, who is travelling to the US to meet the vice-president, Mike Pence, and the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, would not have to discuss the deal in great detail because it was working well, with US officials already visiting both offshore camps . \nDutton said that he expected people would start to leave Manus Island and Nauru “in the not too distant future … in the next couple of months”. \nAsked if the US resettlement deal had acted as a lure to refugees to come to Australia, Dutton conceded there was evidence that people smugglers had tried to turn it “into a message of hope” to sell boat journeys to Australia. \nHe said the government had not made a statement about whether boats had increased, but added: “These people smugglers have not gone away.” \nRefugees would be prevented from reaching Australia with increased surveillance, he said, and warning that no one who arrived in future would get the benefit of the US deal.
