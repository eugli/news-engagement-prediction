Knowing they needed a little something more they brought in younger brother Toby, (vocals) to round out the group. Working together has been easy, “We actually get along really well. We all have our thing and work in categories by preference,” Connor says. “I write vocal melodies, Riley writes lyrics, and Toby helps with both. We all do our own thing, but also contribute to each other.” \nIn 2015, the group signed to RCA Records, released their hit song “Model” and toured with the Vamps and co-headlined a European tour with Christina Grimmie. Since becoming a group, the brothers have garnered over 36 million views on YouTube. In 2014, the group toured in support of their debut EP, I Like That. Aside from headlining shows all over the world, the group has supported Cody Simpson, Olly Murs and Fifth Harmony. Things started to heat up when the group was named the winners of the third annual “Macy’s IHeartRadio Rising Star” campaign, earning them a spot at the iHeartRadio Music Festival alongside such acts as Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Nicki Minaj, One Direction, and more. The trio also performed at the 2014 Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade and had 3 singles hit the Radio Disney charts. \nThe group is set to release their next EP All The Lights on April 8th via RCA records. The 6 track EP will feature current single, “Model,” as well as 5 brand new tracks from the group. Fans who pre-order the EP starting today will receive an instant grat of both “Model” and new track, “When I’m Gone.” \nConjuring up the optimism in the band’s name—inspired by the sentiment “make a difference before you exit”— the band works daily to make their way to the top but they never fail to stop and appreciate what has got them thus far. “There’s no way we’d be anywhere without our incredible fans. They are behind us every step of the way and are a huge piece of this band,” states youngest brother Toby. In light of the many short lived and fly by night artists, this young, singer/songwriting, brother driven band, is one to be around for a while. \n— You can catch them perform live on InqPOP!
