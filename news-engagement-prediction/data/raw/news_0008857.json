Trump encourages Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to “go nuclear” on Supreme Court confirmation battle. https://t.co/JrPGsZWv2k pic.twitter.com/OwOHnfDUiz \n— ABC News (@ABC) February 1, 2017 \nYesterday, Senator Ted Cruz told reporters that when it comes to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, “all procedural options are on the table.” It appears as if President Donald Trump is in lockstep with his former Republican presidential rival, because today POTUS told the press that he would encourage Mitch McConnell to “go nuclear,” if Democrats attempt to filibuster Gorsuch’s selection. \nThe move would essentially strip the minority Democrats from the ability to filibuster Gorsuch, ensuring that 51 votes from Senate Republicans would lock up his selection to fill the shoes of the late Antonin Scalia . Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has indicated he would consider filibustering the pick; currently Democrats hold 48 seats in the United States Senate, and typically 60 votes would be required to pass through a SCOTUS pick. \n“There’s a certain dishonesty if they go against their vote,” President Trump said Wednesday when asked about the unanimous vote that Gorsuch received in 2010 to join the 10th Circuit. “Great judge, and he’ll be a great justice.” \nTrump cautioned that “if we end up with the same gridlock” on this particular issue that has plagued Washington politics for years, “I would say, Mitch, if you can, go nuclear,” he said to Majority Leader McConnell indirectly. “That would be an absolute shame if a man of this quality was caught up in the web. So I would say — it’s up to Mitch — but I would say, go for it,” he continued Wednesday. \nTrump made his comments late Wednesday morning at a meeting at the White House, flanked by Wayne LaPierre of the NRA. \nWatch above via ABC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T22:22:55.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
