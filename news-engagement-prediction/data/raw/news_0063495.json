But this is not a guarantee to take weapons to turn against you neighbour. The Tugens, Njems, Pokots and Marakwet should stay together in peace,\" said Prof Lonyangapuo. \nHe continued, \"Let's allow the security teams in the region look for the killers. Lack of food and drought is worse than the deaths.\" \nThey questioned why local leaders are still in Nairobi going about their daily activities instead of joining their people in mourning and finding a lasting solution to the problems bedevilling them like drought. \nALSO READ: Schools shut as insecurity worsens in Baringo \n\"We call for ceasefire. Blame games now will only ignite emotions. We appeal to our leaders and kinsmen to stop any further revenge attack and seek peace,\" urged Lomunokol. \n\"We appeal to our kinsmen to stop what is happening. It won't help instead it will only worsen the situation. The loss of these leaders should not be an opportunity to lose more lives.\" \nMoroto condemned the incidences, saying even when they have issues with neighbours from Uganda; they called for dialogue among the elders. \n\"We had problems with the Sebeyi in Uganda and colleagues from Trans Nzoia but we ensured it didn't get out of hand. We took the initiative as elected leaders, what are our colleagues still doing in Parliament and there is trouble at home?\" he questioned. \nProf Lonyangapuo said, \"We call on our colleagues from Baringo County to quickly go home and console with their people. I am surprised that for the last three days, no leader has gone home instead they are busy exchanging in the media.\" \nThe senator said as leader who understands the price people pay in the absence of peace, they cannot keep quiet.\"We are also pastoralists. We cannot sit and watch things escalate in Baringo. We must be part of the citizens' watch, including sleeping under trees. We have done it with Elgeyo/Marakwet county leaders, it can be done in Baringo too,\" said Lonyangapuo. \nHe went on, \"Some of these challenges are man-made. If leaders fear addressing the challenges they should quit. The electorate has six months to send them packing.\" \nALSO READ: Stop these killings or else it consumes us all \nInterior Cabinet secretary Joseph Nkaissery and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet were also not spared the MPs wrath, as they questioned what they are doing to address the situation in Baringo County. \n\"Nkaissery and Boinnet are sitting pretty think that by ordering operations, the problem will be solved. This is not helping, if you do good, everything will be fine. They should focus more on peace initiatives,\" said Moroto. \nTiaty MP Asman Kamama was also told to apologise for linking Kanu to the happening, saying it is not a way to resolve problems. \n\"Kamama should apologies. The killings have nothing to do with party politics. No party fights can lead to insecurity. He should not try to drag Kanu to the happenings there,\" said Lonyangapuo. \nHe continued, \"If he (Kamama) knows in particular the killers, their party number and residence he should say. It is not good to throw words, it will only stir emotions.\" \nLast Wednesday, a teacher was killed after suspected bandits sprayed bullets at Kapindasum primary school in Baringo South. \nThe weekend killing of the two leaders came just a day after Baringo leaders were summoned by Nkaissery over insecurity in the area.
