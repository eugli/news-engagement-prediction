Why (did the) DPM get so excited,\" said the PKR deputy president \nAzmin, who is also Selangor Mentri Besar, was responding to Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi's comment that Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Anifah Aman would not be resigning. \nOn Friday, Azmin posted on Twitter, asking \"Is it true that a senior minister has resigned?\" \nAlthough no names were mentioned, Dr Ahmad Zahid said he knew that Azmin was referring to Anifah. \nHe also accused Azmin and the Opposition of spreading lies through social media. \nPrime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak had also responded to Azmin's tweet, saying that that no minister had informed him of a decision to quit the Cabinet. \nNajib said that he could only assume that Azmin was lying to create a stir. \nFollowing Najib's reply, Azmin asked Najib to remain calm and questioned his reaction to his original tweet. \nWhen Azmin was asked about a screencrap of a tweet, supposedly from his account claiming that it was Federal Territories Minister Datuk Seri Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor who would be resigning, he simply said that the tweet was fake. <> <>", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T18:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T14:15:53.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
