The 10 will be feted on Feb. 11 at a luncheon in association with Tiffany & Co. and during the reception hosted by Medienboard Berlin-Brandenburg at the Berlin Intl. Film Festival. \nDirector, Germany \nBerger realized he wanted to make movies in the ninth grade, when he visited a local arts school in Germany and discovered he could study film. “It immediately sparked my interest; I couldn’t believe it,” Berger says. “I thought you could study law or medicine or teaching or engineering or German and that was it; I was totally overwhelmed and I really wanted to do it from then on.” However, when a 14-year-old Berger returned home to proudly announce his newfound passion, his older brother wasn’t exactly supportive, telling him to “forget about it,” and informing him that if he pursued film studies he would “end up driving a cab.” Some 33 years later, having helmed five episodes of the critically acclaimed German Cold War thriller series “Deutschland 83,” and with three episodes of the Scott Free and AMC collaboration “The Terror” in the can, it’s fair to say Berger has proven his brother wrong. \nActor, Poland \nGierszał followed his father’s lead and chose acting when he was in high school, because, he says, “I knew I wanted to express myself, and drawing seemed like, not expressive enough.” The Kraków Academy of Dramatic Arts took a chance on him, and Gierszał made an eye-catching screen debut in Poland’s 2009 foreign-language Oscar entry “All That I Love,” which had premiered in World Dramatic Competition at the Sundance Film Festival. Gierszał returned to Park City last year via two very different films — Polish killer-mermaid disco musical “The Lure” and Chad Hartigan’s indie comedy-drama “Morris From America”— and next month he heads to the Berlinale with Agnieszka Holland’s thriller “Spoor.” Gierszał refuses to divulge secrets of this Golden Bear competitor, saying only, “It’s about an older lady. She’s a bit, as you could say, nuts.” \nActress, Germany \nOne of Germany’s busiest young actresses, Fries won great acclaim for her portrayal of a terminally ill young woman seeking assisted suicide in 2013’s “Zurich.” The rising star next appears in Tom Tykwer’s highly anticipated historical crime series “Babylon Berlin,” from Sky Deutschland, ARD Degeto, X Filme, and Beta Film, set in the glamorous and decadent German capital of the 1920s. “For me, as a Berliner, it was really enriching to move through the Berlin of the 1920s,” she says. The actress has also appeared in “Lou Andreas-Salomé,” about the famed a Russian-born psychoanalyst, and the upcoming “Rakete Perelman,” about a young woman who joins an artist commune. She is set to play an elite music student in her next, as-yet-untitled film, in which she co-stars with Louis Hofmann (“Under the Sand”). Fries, whose favorite recent films include “Blue → Valentine,”“Mon Roi” and “American Honey,” says she enjoys working with directors who are collaborative and work with actors to develop characters. “I currently find Maren Ade, Andrea Arnold and Xavier Dolan very exciting,” she says. \nActress, Netherlands \nAs a girl, Hoeks was always trying to figure out why people made certain choices in life. “And that turned into a life’s quest,” she says. After being scouted by Elite Model Management at age 14, Hoeks decided to become an actor following her high school graduation, studying at the Maastricht Theatre Academy. Success came early, with an acclaimed supporting role in the 2007 midlife-crisis drama “Duska,” and she points to Giuseppe Tornatore’s “The Best Offer” (2013) as a personal favorite. Now 33, she is less forthcoming about her role in this year’s hot ticket “Blade Runner 2049.”“It’s a big secret,” she laughs, but its scale and the anticipation, hasn’t daunted her. “I want to make the right choices,” she says, “to be able to combine intelligent blockbuster movies with independent gems and to tell the stories I feel are worth telling.” \nProducer, Germany \nSince partnering with writer-director Maren Ade in 2000 to form their production shingle Komplizen Film, Jackowski has established herself as a multi-faceted producer of German and international films. She is celebrating the success of “Toni Erdmann,” the team’s biggest commercial and critical hit yet. The pic wowed Cannes last year and is a front-runner for this year’s foreign-language Oscar. “We knew that the film was good, but the first reactions that we received in Cannes were really overwhelming. It is amazing to see how well the film translates to other countries and audiences,” Jackowski says. She describes Komplizen Film as “a very director-driven company” aimed at giving its helmers “the maximum creative freedom.” Jackowski is developing projects with some of Europe’s most exciting filmmakers, including Valeska Grisebach, Vanessa Jopp, Visar Morina, and Sonja Heiss. Komplizen Film also co-produced Chilean director Sebastián Lelio’s upcoming Berlinale competition screener “A Fantastic Woman” and is on board upcoming projects from Portugal’s Miguel Gomes and Romanian filmmaker Radu Jude. “We couldn’t do the films that we love without our international network,” Jackowski adds. \nDirector, Italy \nWhen Mainetti approached Italian producers to make his first feature, the genre-bending superhero movie “They Call Me Jeeg,” he was told he “was crazy,” he recalls, because they claimed “genre movies don’t work in Italy any more.” So Mainetti set up his own shingle, Goon Films, and got the pic made after several years. “Jeeg” became Italy’s 2016 sleeper hit, scoring more than $5 million at the box office and selling widely internationally, including to distributor Uncork’d in the U.S. Mainetti, who is now an Italian industry darling, will be shooting a film co-produced by Goon and Lucky Red this year. “I’m still audacious,” he says. “If ‘Jeeg’ was juggling three genres, this one’s going to juggle six.” \nActor, Germany \nNay’s popularity has soared following his breakout performance in the hit Cold War spy series “Deutschland 83,” the first original German-language drama to broadcast on a U.S. network and the highest-rated foreign-language drama ever on British TV. “It makes me really happy that the series was so enthusiastically received by so many people internationally — it means a lot, not just for me as an actor but for everyone involved in the production,” Nay says. The series has been a major career boost for Nay, who is seeing more offers for international projects. He will next shoot “Deutschland 86,” and recently wrapped up work on the second part of “Line of Separation,” a ZDF miniseries about a town divided by the partitioning of post-war Germany. The actor-musician has won fans kudos for his roles in the hard-hitting feature “We Are Young. We are Strong”; war drama “Summer Solstice”; and the bittersweet love story “A Minute’s Silence,” as well as for his musical talent as lead singer of the popular band Pudeldame. \nDirector, Slovenia \nSlovenian director Okorn thought he’d be a skateboarder, but when he tried to film his exploits he realized he was better with a camera than he was on wheels. After a string of skate shorts in the early 2000s, he made his debut with “Here and There” in 2005 —“sort of a Guy Ritchie kind of movie, because at that time Guy Ritchie was so cool,” he says. A chance meeting with a Polish producer led to work in Warsaw; a hit TV series (“39 ½”) and two local successes later (2011’s “Letters to Santa” and last year’s “Planet Single”), Okorn is prepping his U.S. debut. Titled “Life in a Year,” the Overbrook production stars Jaden Smith as a music-loving teen with a strict father. “He meets a girl, and everything goes to hell for the father,” says Okorn. “It’s one of those coming-of-age films.” \nDirector, Belgium \nWhen he was in his third year of film school in Belgium, Pront told himself that he would make one short film and if it didn’t turn out to be the best, then he would find another profession. The subsequent film, “Plan B,” won best short at the Leuven Film Festival in 2008, as well as the public’s choice award, meaning that Pront could continue to forge a path in the film business after all. His latest work, “The Ardennes,” was the Belgian selection for foreign-language film in the Oscar race, and the director hopes that the movie’s success (Film Movement released it in the U.S.), combined with his penchant for making genre films, might allow him to direct across the Atlantic. “I hope to do something in the U.S. I’m so thankful to the Belgian movie system, but it’s also frustrating because Belgium is such a small country,” Pront says. “It’s almost impossible to make a profit out of movies because they’re government funded, and a lot of people have to go see the movie to earn its money back, but I think I could work well in the American system.” \nActress, Hungary \nVersatile thespian Tenki’s star will rise in 2017 with a leading role in helmer-writer Éva Gárdos’ forthcoming period crime thriller “Budapest Noir.”“She is sexy and loving and can be as tough as nails,” Gárdos says. “She’s part of this young, modern generation of Hungarian actors that are willing to go deep into their characters.” A sensual beauty and graduate of the Hungarian Academy of Drama and Film, Tenki boasts numerous stage credits and legit acting awards. She’s a member of Budapest’s Örkény Theater. Her film roles include the hit comedy “Poligamy” (2009), István Szabó’s “The Door,” (2011), and auteur György Pálfi’s “Free Fall” (2014). Berlinale audiences can see her in Ildikó Enyedi’s competition title “On Body and Soul.” Image: Courtesy of Liv Lisa Fries/Mitja Okorn Image: Courtesy of Edward Berger Image: Courtesy of Jakub Gierszal Image: Courtesy of Liv Lisa Fries Image: Courtesy of Sylvia Hoeks Image: Courtesy of Janine Jackowski Image: Courtesy of Gabriele Mainetti Image: Courtesy of Jonas Nay Image: Courtesy of Mitja Okorn Image: Courtesy of Robin Pront Image: Courtesy of Reka Tenki ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T14:49:30.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
