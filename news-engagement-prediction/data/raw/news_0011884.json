Two great players in their prime, then aged 20 and 24 respectively. Both, tragically, have now passed on within the past 15 months. Even athletic immortals do not earn immunity from real life’s sting. \nPerhaps the ultimate tribute, however, is that both men will be remembered worldwide as much for the spirit and dignity they ended up showing off the field as what they achieved on it. Van der Westhuizen, who has died aged 45 , ranked among the finest scrum-halves the rugby world has seen but the bravery he displayed in his subsequent fight against the ravages of motor neurone disease was more inspiring still. Joost van der Westhuizen, South Africa rugby great, dies aged 45 Read more \nHis determination to raise awareness and funds for the families of fellow sufferers through his J9 Foundation became a relentless mission from the moment he was diagnosed in 2011. He had first noticed a weakness in his right arm towards the end of 2008 but, despite being restricted to a wheelchair, travelled the world so that others might benefit in the longer term. As he told an interviewer from ESPN last year : “Rugby was the first half of my life; I’m playing the second half now. I was arrogant when I was playing, without knowing who I was. I have learnt more about life the last five years.” \nThe condition, which attacks the nerve cells that control the muscles which permit movement, speech, breathing and swallowing, could not have struck a more obdurate or more instinctively competitive target. Anyone interviewing him during his playing days tended to be struck by the same thing: staring into the palest pair of blue eyes in world rugby was always an unnerving experience. \nNot half as unnerving, of course, as playing against him. Even the wonderfully shrewd, calculating Fourie du Preez, the only other modern Springbok scrum-half of similar stature, would have loved the knife-sharp intensity of the 6ft 1in tall Van der Westhuizen at his best and, when it really mattered, the latter always seemed to turn a decent side into something more than the apparent sum of its parts.

Less satisfyingly, he ended up playing under half a dozen different Springbok coaches and suffered more than his share of serious injuries. Remarkably he played in the 1999 Rugby World Cup semi-final and play-off game unaware he had ruptured ligaments in a knee which had already been operated on. “In the first operation they replaced the tendon so there was no nerve system,” he once told me. “When it happened again I didn’t feel anything. I didn’t know I’d done it.” \nTypically he fought his way back again to represent the Springboks at a third World Cup in 2003. He retired as South Africa’s record cap-holder, forever entwined in the national imagination with the extraordinary 1995 success at Ellis Park which culminated in another timeless photograph, this time of Nelson Mandela presenting the Webb Ellis Cup to Francois Pienaar . \nThe Lomu tackle, he used to joke, was merely a stroke of good fortune – “I think he fell over me” – but the attrition rate among the Rainbow Nation’s pin-up boys has been significant. Their master coach Kitch Christie lost his battle with cancer in 1998 aged 58 while flanker Ruben Kruger, who had fought brain cancer for 10 years, died two months short of his 40th birthday in 2010. \nNow the pair have been joined by Van der Westhuizen, who was admitted to a Johannesburg hospital over the weekend and would have been 46 later this month. He is survived by his estranged wife Amor Vittone and their two children, son Jordan and daughter Kylie.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:37:00.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
