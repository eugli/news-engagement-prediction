Mercury Press The damaged skull was found on on East Head beach in Wittering, West Sussex, on Monday Mercury Press 4 Helen Frost, 57, was walking her dogs when she came across the skull \nThe artist called the cops who have sent the skull, which appears to be missing the frontal region from above the eyes to the jaw, for forensic analysis. \nHelen, from Fishbourne, West Sussex, regularly scours the beach for items to use in art projects but was unsure of what she had picked up earlier this week and asked friends on Facebook for help. \nShe said: “We were out walking the dogs when I saw it. I make art from used objects found on the beach so I’m always looking for things. \n“When I first saw it, my immediate thought was ‘what is that?’ – I’ve never seen something like it before.

Mercury Press 4 The skull, which which could be the remains of a shipwrecked sailor buried in an ‘unofficial cemetery’, has been sent away for analysis \nHelen said: “They said that they have taken it to an anthropologist to date so I think they must think it is quite old. \n“I’m a bit squeamish so I’m glad that I didn’t bring it home. \n“The fact that it was a skull makes it a bit more disturbing than if it was a thigh bone – the fact that it once had a face and a brain. \n“Some people were concerned that it could be recent – the skull of a missing person – so I’m glad that it is looking like it is quite old. \n“About seven or eight miles away there have been lots of Roman discoveries so it could well be related to that. \n“I have seen some odd plastic objects and a lot of rubbish but not something like this.” \nWest Sussex has proved to be a hotbed of archaeological discoveries, with three near-complete Roman houses being found under a park in Chichester in January. \nThe nearby village of Fishbourne is also home to a first century Roman palace which houses the largest collection of mosaics in the UK. \nSince 1974, five human skeletons have been found have been found on beaches in West Wittering. Mercury Press 4 She was walking her dogs on the beach and scouring the sand for items she could use for her art at the time \nExamination of two of the skulls, found in 1974 and 1975, suggested that they had been buried for over 100 years and were both males in their mid-fifties. \nA collection of 18th century buttons found in the same vicinity helped date the body parts, and local experts have several theories about the ‘unofficial cemetery’. \nIt is believed that the bodies may have been the victims of a historic shipwreck, and were buried on the beach because the local parish did not want to take responsibility for the deceased. \nAnother theory is that they are the remains of prisoners held on ships in the harbour and buried in the sand rather than in a traditional graveyard if they died. \nJames Kenny, Archaeology Officer for Chichester District Council said: “The key things are where did it come from and, crucially, the date. \n“It does look very old and looks to be worn by the sea but the radiocarbon dating will tell us that.” \nA spokesperson for Sussex Police said: “Police were called at 10.34am on January 30 after a human skull was discovered at East Head on West Wittering beach. \n“Local officers attended and a Scenes of Crime Officer collected the skull at around 1.20pm. \n“At this stage it is not believed to be linked to any suspicious circumstances but has been sent away for forensic analysis.” \nWe pay for your stories!
