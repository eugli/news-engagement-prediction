The film is directed by Robert Rodriguez and written and produced by James Cameron. \nShe joins the previously announced cast that includes Rosa Salazar, Jennifer Connelly, Jackie Earle Haley, Christoph Waltz, Ed Skrein, Mahershala Ali, and Keean Johnson. Rodriguez will play Gelda in the film. In the comics, the character was a slim cyborg warrior. \nAlita tells the future-set story of a cyborg girl (Salazar) rescued from a junkyard by a scientist (Waltz) who rebuilds her and together they explore her mysterious past. Even though the Alita has finished shooting, the native-3D movie isn’t expected until July 20, 2018, to give production time to build the film’s extensive visual effects. Alita is live-action yet will also use plenty of CG for its backgrounds, cyber body modifications and, in certain cases, actor’s faces.
