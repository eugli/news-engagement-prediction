He suspects they'll be there for a while.\n\"I was really lucky to see them,\" he said. \"It was in the right place at the right time.\"\nPositive feedback An increase in turkeys has started appearing in the St. Stephen area over the years. (Jeff Craig)\nThe St. Stephen resident, who enjoys capturing photos and video of the wild birds, says he has received a lot of positive response from the public regarding his work.\n\"I enjoy people seeing stuff like that,\" he said. \"People say 'Lots of Christmas dinners.\"\nHe said a lot of residents will also put out food in their bird feeders for the turkeys to eat.\nBut this isn't the first time Craig has spotted the flock of wildlife. He's seen the birds roaming throughout the area over the past few years and he expects the number of birds to increase.\n\"I love to see them,\" he said. \"I love nature.\"\nKyle Bedford, who lives within the area, sees the wild turkeys almost every day on his way to and from school.\nA few weeks ago, the Grade 12 student was driving home and hit one.\n\"I can usually just honk the horn and they get out of the way,\" said the 17-year-old in a Facebook message.\n\"It worked a few times, but one afternoon they were all over the road and I held the horn. The turkeys wouldn't get out of the way and boom I hit one.\"\nNew Brunswick sees increase in turkeys Steve Nicholson, director of operations with the Canadian Wild Turkey Federation, said there's been an influx in turkeys travelling across the border from Maine who have established themselves in the St. Stephen and Saint Andrews areas.\nA large group can also be found in the Carleton County and Victoria County areas of the province.\n\"They're pretty resistant to a lot,\" he said.\nNicholson said the turkeys started travelling to New Brunswick almost a decade ago.\nAlthough hunting wild turkeys is illegal in New Brunswick, there is a wild turkey-hunting season in Maine in the spring. Nicholson said he's hopeful New Brunswick will see a wild turkey-hunting season in the near future.\n'They'll spread out as the population grows and then that population will grow.' - Steve Nicholson \"Turkeys don't need to check in with security at the border,\" he said. \"They're just moving from this area to that area.\"\nThe turkeys feed on bugs, seeds, grass and berries throughout the year.\n\"As a flock grows in numbers, there's not necessarily enough food source in one area to survive on so they'll just naturally migrate.\"\nNicholson said land in New Brunswick is also good for turkeys and they're resilient to heavy snowfall.\nThey can also live in everything from open fields to forests and agricultural lands, but struggle to find food in ice buildup.\n\"They'll spread out as the population grows and then that population will grow,\" he said. \"They eventually make their way across the landscape.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:19:11.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
