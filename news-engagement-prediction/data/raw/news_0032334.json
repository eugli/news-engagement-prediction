In fact, quite a few of his 66 Real Madrid goals are scored in the final minutes of important games. \nTo celebrate his ability to score late goals, Ramos is seriously thinking about changing his squad number to 93, the minute he scored that vital equaliser in the 2014 Champions League final against Atletico Madrid. \nNo, this could actually happen - the Spaniard dropped a huge hint during a Facebook Live Q&A as he answered questions in front of thousands. \nWhen someone asked about his current squad number four, he hinted at changing his squad number: \n\"The '4' has given me a lot of luck and has accompanied me throughout my career with Real. \" \n\"But don't think that I haven't considered changing it for 93.\" \nBack in December, Ramos earned his side a 1-1 draw in El Clasico against Barcelona and you guessed it - a last-gasp equaliser kept Real Madrid six points clear of their rivals. \nAnd let's not forget his 90th minute headed equaliser in the UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla back n August 2016. \nIf you're like me, and suffer from OCD, then this could be a tough read. \nOnce upon a time at Real Madrid... \nWe can get through this together, guys.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:31:05.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
