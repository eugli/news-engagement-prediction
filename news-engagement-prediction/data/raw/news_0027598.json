Her voice was slightly shaky at the beginning of the song, but smooth during the remainder of the stunning performance, which earned her a standing ovation. \nIt was the fourth time the British superstar has performed at the Grammy Awards. \nIn addition to album of the year, Adele is up for record of the year (“Hello”), song of the year (“Hello”), best pop solo performance (“Hello), and best pop vocal album (“25”). \nShe has won 10 Grammy previously, including all four general category awards: album of the year, record of the year, song of the year, and best new artist. \nSunday’s Grammys have largely been seen as a showdown between her and Beyonce, who is also nominated for album, record, and song of the year.
