(Minas Panagiotakis/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday, February 24, 2017, 10:46 PM \nWith the NHL trade deadline approaching on Wednesday at 3 p.m., Alain Vigneault says he's pleased with the squad that he has and is keeping his focus on what's happening on the ice. \n\"For me, right now I like my team,\" Vigneault said Friday. \"I like the way the guys prepare and their work ethic and how they compete. Jeff (Gorton) and I communicate every day on our team and obviously our needs, etc. But I'm focused on the group that I have now and on the next game that's coming up, and I'm preparing them. He knows my opinion on our group and if there are areas we can improve. He knows that, he's known that for quite some time. I'm really focused on this group and what we need to do. \n\"I'm happy with what we have here. I think we've got a good team, a good, young group that's hungry, and that's what I'm focused on.\" \nBusiness has picked up a bit over the last couple of days around the league. After a Thursday trade saw Carolina send Ron Hainsey to Pittsburgh for Danny Kristo and a 2017 second-round pick, two Western Conference teams made deals to bolster their forward groups. The Ducks acquired Patrick Eaves from Dallas for a conditional second-round pick in 2017, and the Blackhawks traded for Tomas Jurco, sending a third-rounder this summer to Detroit. \nRangers captain Ryan McDonagh says there hasn't been much chatter among players about the deadline and what may happen. \n\"For whatever reason it seems like it hasn't been a big distraction or talked about much with our group,\" McDonagh said. \"Maybe just because we're playing so many games. We've got a stretch here where we're playing every other day. That kind of helps take your mind off of things. Our group, we've got good character in this room so I think that's a sign for us that we feel confident in ourselves regardless if there's a change made or not. Everybody gets along with everybody and we have really defined roles now within our team and guys are feeling confident in their games at the right time.\" \nThe Rangers are confident because of improved defensive play over the last month that has them on an 8-1-1 run heading into Saturday's game against the Devils. Better positioning and net-front play has helped Henrik Lundqvist be on top of his game after rough occasions for everyone earlier this season when the Rangers had games allowing six or seven goals. \n\"Those are moments where your team really feels it, and feels a need to step up and look at yourself as an individual about what you need to do to bring a better game to the rink,\" McDonagh said. \n*** \nKevin Klein (back spasms) won't play in this weekend's back-to-back at New Jersey and at home against Columbus. Dan Girardi received a maintenance day Friday but should play Saturday, when Antti Raanta will start in goal. Lundqvist will start Sunday.
