The reality star took to Twitter to tell her beloved and their fans what she thought of him and his collection. Keeping things casual: The 39-year-old stepped out into the streets of New York looking cozy in black jogging pants and a light blue sweatshirt Kim tweeted: 'So proud of my baby for his amazing show today! It was so good! I'm so SO proud of him!!! #yeezyseason5. To celebrate the show the couple headed out but they were denied a quiet dinner as fans swarmed the rapper. Supportive spouse: The father-of-two received heaps of support from his wife Kim Kardashian, 36, following the show Many asked him to sign a pair of his Yeezy 350 sneakers and one fan even presented some obvious fakes which Kanye immediately noticed and curled his lip up. The show was attended by multiple celebrities, including Kylie Jenner, boyfriend Tyga, LaLa Anthony and Anna Wintour. Good company: Kim sat front row, alongside Anna Wintour and Vogue Paris editor-in-chief Carine Roitfeld This season appeared to have a slightly more intimate feel, as previous seasons have been held outside and in stadium-like venues. Kanye, who has been criticized for his clothing in the past, did not seem to take the words to heart. He presented a similar collection of ultra-simple lounge-wear mixed with military-inspired pieces. Stylish: This season appeared to have a slightly more intimate feel, as previous seasons have been held outside and in stadium-like venues Homegrown: The new additions also included camo cargo pants, plaid, long fur coats, and sweatshirts with California locations like Calabasas printed across them The new additions to the line, which is a collaboration with Adidas, also included camo cargo pants, plaid, long fur coats, and sweatshirts with California locations like Calabasas printed across them. Kanye was clearly a fan of doubling up looks this season, pairing camo with more camo and denim with contrasting denim. There were no slinky Spanx-like bodysuits this time around, but the line did feature red jumpsuits and tracksuits, as well as one sexy black bodysuit. Despite seemingly going off without a hitch this year, the show was not without its drama. This season, the mishaps started right from the outset, with Kanye originally scheduling his show for 5 p.m. â€” the same time always reserved for Georgian Chapman and Keren Craig's line, Marchesa. Typically, designers are given their show time slots by the CFDA to ensure minimal overlap, but Kanye took matters into his own hands when scheduling his show, leading to a reprimand. He eventually decided to reschedule for the same day at 3 p.m. 'Kanye called me personally to let me know that he had no intention of showing on top of another designer, and was unaware that there was a conflict. He explained that once he realized Marchesa was in the time slot, he immediately looked at alternative options,' CFDA Chief Executive Officer Steven Kolb told WWD.
