Without safe drinking water, restaurants, a state university and other schools may be closed until Sunday, officials estimate. \nChapel Hill residents would be ordered not to use their water or would be without water altogether for at least 24 hours, perhaps even until Sunday, Orange Water and Sewer Authority (OWASA) executive director Ed Kerwin told reporters Friday. \n“This is essentially a worst case scenario,” Kerwin said, WRAL reported .

Kerwin estimated between 1.5 to 2 million gallons of water rushed out with the break. Do not use water for any purposes. We are working diligently to repair the issue. Please see https://t.co/5SFEqspHvR for more info. — Orange Water & Sewer (@OWASA1) February 3, 2017 \nHundreds were without water services, and even the 80,000-plus residents who still had running water were warned against using it, as it could contaminate the overall supply. \nWater bottle donation drives popped up, and portable toilets were rushed to senior citizen centers as well as schools. \nStudents at Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill were dismissed early. Even UNC’s baseball game against Notre Dame scheduled for Saturday was in doubt, WRAL reported. HALLS WON'T CLOSE. Students are encouraged to leave if possible, but port-o-johns are coming & bottled water is being delivered to Rams Head — UNC Housing (@unchousing) February 3, 2017 \nThe Orange County Health Director ordered all restaurants in OWASA’s jurisdiction closed. \nThere are no reports of a connection between the water main break and the fluoride overfeeding.
