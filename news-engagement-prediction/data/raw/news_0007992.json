Leeds United's Pontus Jansson celebrates scoring the winner at Blackburn \nLeeds move to within one point of third-placed Reading thanks to their fourth league win in five games, while Blackburn remain in the relegation zone, three points from safety. \nHaving made 10 changes for Leeds' FA Cup defeat at Sutton on the weekend, Garry Monk reverted to his strongest team as his side looked to continue their push for promotion. \nHowever, it was the hosts who appeared to have taken the lead early on through Jason Lowe - but the goal was disallowed after a foul on Rob Green, who had flapped at the original cross from Bennett. Ryan Nyambe and Kemar Roofe tangle \nMidway through the half, Chris Wood was inches away from handing Leeds the lead, but his free-kick from 20 yards out flashed narrowly beyond the far post. \nNeat build-up play then saw Luke Ayling burst down the right before sending in a terrific cross for Kemar Roofe, who could only direct his header wide of the mark. \nBlackburn started brightly after the break but Jansson headed away numerous crosses to keep the hosts at bay. Stuart Dallas is tackled by Darragh Lenihan \nBennett almost squeezed a free-kick into the top corner from out wide but Green did well to parry it wide. \nThe deadlock was then broken in the 74th minute with a superb cross-field ball from Liam Bridcutt finding Dallas, who drilled an effort beyond Jason Steele from a narrow angle. \nLeeds' lead lasted just nine minutes however, with Bennett trying his luck from 30 yards out, and though it was not the greatest of finishes, it bounced into the bottom corner beyond the seemingly unsighted Green.

I thought we looked the team at 0-0 that would get in front, with some great balls in the box, albeit we find ourselves behind to - I have to say - a wonderful finish. \n\"That being said we picked ourselves up, scored a very good goal through Elliott and had a wonderful chance through good football to get in front. \n\"We certainly seemed in control of the game at that time and we've switched off. Whatever you want to call it, lack of concentration. A wonderful delivery for the set-play but the lad's been allowed a free header. It's certainly hard to take.\" \nLeeds boss Garry Monk: \n\"It wasn't pretty by any stretch of the imagination. Neither team got control of anything. (It was) A bit to and fro, a bit of a grind. I said to the players afterwards, I said: 'Look, there'll be situations you'll face throughout the season and there's six or seven games you can't play at your best, but you have to make sure you find a way to win'. And I think the mentality we have was very clear. \n\"We defended our box very well, stayed strong when it was difficult and in those crucial moments we scored two good goals. Yes (we were) a bit lucky to come away with the three points but the mentality and character is what I was pleased with. That's the positive to come out of the game. \n\"We know we didn't perform near our level but we found a way to win and for me, that's a real good sign for a good team with a strong mentality.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:38:54.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
