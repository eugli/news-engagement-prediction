Take a moment to make your “it me” and “Note 7” jokes, have a nice giggle, and let’s move forward. An estimated 51,000 units are part of the US recall, though an additional 7,600 bottles were also sold in Canada . The bottles hold one liter of liquid, and are blue-tinted, and labeled dishwasher-safe with an expiration date of April 2020. Under pressure — either from the carbonation process or shaking then opening while it’s full of fizzy water — could cause the bottles to explode. The CPSC said these bottles were sold at Walmart, Bed Bath & Beyond, Target and other major retailers between February 2016 and January 2017. As of February, there were no reports of related injuries in either the US or Canada. Affected customers can request a full refund or replacement bottles directly from SodaStream.
