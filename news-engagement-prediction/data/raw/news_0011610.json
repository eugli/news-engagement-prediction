And while a short Super Bowl spot was shown during the Big Game and was released online earlier this weekend , an extended look was released on Sunday. \nIt will be autobot v. autobot in the latest installment, and it looks like Optimus Prime will be fighting his old friends in “The Last Knight.” Related China’s Huahua Boards Paramount’s ‘Transformers: The Last Knight’ \n“The Last Knight” will see regular heavyweights like Mark Wahlberg, Stanley Tucci, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and John Turturro return to the series, while adding others like “100 Things to Do Before School” actress Isabela Moner and Anthony Hopkins, who make their “Transformers” debuts. \nThe film ran into controversy in September while filming in the U.K., with photos emerging in a local tabloid of Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of former Prime Minister and World War II leader Winston Churchill, being used as the location for a Nazi base. \nIn an interview with Variety , Tony Hayes, head of the Veteran’s Association U.K., called the decision to cover the palace in Nazi insignia and have men enter its main building in Nazi uniform a “total disgrace.” \n“A lot of the older generation find it totally appalling. It’s an insult,” Hayes added. \n“Transformers: The Last Knight” will hit theaters on June 23, 2017.
