Last week we were there sampling the Spanish street food of La Bandera, this week it’s the mash-up of Asian and world food in The Fusion Lab. \nWith a menu led by ex-Manchester House chef Brice Moor and directed by Viet Shack’s Nelson Lam, The Fusion Lab is a more experimental, exciting and – frankly – more accomplished outfit than many in the Arndale Market; with every element made from scratch and showcased with a witty menu. \nThe Arndale Market has undergone a bit of a food market overhaul, designed to pull the food market’s socks up at the prospect of Altrincham Market setting up in the Smithfield Building across the road. The Fusion Lab (Photo: Lucy Lovell) \nA focus on food traders was upshot of the re-furb. Extra tables were added, and young start-ups like The Fusion Lab, Pancho’s Burritos, and Simone’s Healthy Dessert Bar took centre stage. \nBut there’s still something very Arndale-ey about it. \nTo be honest, Manchester Arndale is not my favourite place to eat. It’s not even my favourite place to shop, but The Fusion Lab is about to prove that ambiance doesn't matter with food this good. Arndale Market's South Side (Photo: Lucy Lovell) \nAfter ordering from the window, I look for a place to sit down. All the seats are taken, except from the new South Side of the market, and I take a seat opposite La Bandera. Maybe I’m drawn by the Latin hip hop shouting from the speakers.

Golden Touch sells gold hoop earrings the size of doughnuts; Suntech Computers doesn’t sell any computers, does sell every kind of phone cover that’s been on sale since the 90s; and an eyebrow bar, but you’ll have to take my word for it, as they immediately told me to delete any photos of them. It’s classic Arndale. Bling (Photo: Lucy Lovell) \nOn the tables there’s litter everywhere and all kinds of people tucking in to lunch. Old people; young people; office workers having a breakdown (see below) ; cool kids; geeky guys. It’s like a school canteen. The South Side dining area of Manchester Arndale (Photo: Lucy Lovell) \nI was always a bit of a geek at school, so of course I’m sat on my own opposite a kid with peely skin who won’t stop sneezing. \nOn that note, let’s tuck in. \nI go for the 'KFC'. They're taking on the big boys here. Can it be more tasty than an actual KFC? Of course it can. A mammoth portion of gloriously crispy chicken sits on well-seasoned fries, which are peppered with the odd sweet potato. Spring onions give it a lift, as does a little kimchi on the side. A rich homemade ‘Asian gravy’ makes me forget where I am. The portions are huge, and I barely make a dent in it.

Not just because it’s a steal at £7.99, but also because Nelson - who I've known he first set up in Manchester Arndale - recognises me from the adjacent Viet Shack. I try and duck, he waves. He insists it’s on the house and that I shove my tenner back in my wallet. Not paying for reviews is a serious no-no in this industry, but I tried, honest. Pork bao with homemade hoi sin sauce (Photo: Lucy Lovell) \nLuckily, this is the second time I’ve visited. A few weeks back I sampled (and actually paid for) the slow roasted pork bao (£6.50) – which were indulgently soft and chewy, the pork butter-soft with a killer crackling. Fish tacos (£6) were more South American than Asian but delicious nonetheless; guacamole puree, pickled veg and fish all hugged by a soft squid ink wrap. Fish tacos with Chinese beer battered cod and squid ink tortillas (Photo: Lucy Lovell) \nThis is show-stopping comfort food. Ok, Arndale Market is kitsch - and not in a self-aware hipster way - but it’s cheap. Of course it will face competition from Altrincham Market when it opens, but this is a completely different kettle of bao. \nIt might fall short on the ambiance, but The Fusion Lab makes up for it with flavour.
