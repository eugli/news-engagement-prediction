No More Saas-Bahu DRAMA; 11 Changes We Want To See On Television Shows! We Need A BREAK! No More Saas-Bahu DRAMA; 11 Changes We Want To See On Television Shows! Over-stretched storyline, unnecessary leaps or bride swap. Which of these things would you like to change about our daily soaps? Updated: Friday, February 24, 2017, 10:56   \nLove them or hate them, but we simply can't ignore them! In this era of webseries and Netflix, it is ridiculously true that the craze for the daily soaps actually exists! No wonder, they are so popular. \nBe it the supernatural series Naagin or the never-ending love-hate relationship between Abhi-Pragya (Kumkum Bhagya) and the bromance between Shivaay, Omkara and Rudra ( Ishqbaaz ) or the cute love story of Naira and Kartika (Yeh Rishta Kya Kehalata Hai), audiences are simply in awe of these television shows ! \nThere are many shows which came as a breath of fresh air such as Bahu Hamari Rajni_Kant and 24, but they disappeared in no time, after a short but successful run. But, the daily soaps continue to rule the television! \nWhile the lead pair's love story, their crackling chemistry and the lavish settings are what that make the show going, there are a few aspects which we absolutely hate about these shows and want to change them. A looks at the things which we actually need to change about the daily soaps... Over-stretched Storyline \nIt is true that each show picks up a good subject and offers entertainment to its loyal viewers. The recent ones such as Shakti and Dil Se Dil Tak have started on a good note. Eventually, the show loses its charm and the rest is history. The storyline is stretched beyond imagination and twisted in such a way that it becomes monotonous and boring to watch them after a certain time. We, as audiences would want to watch the shows with a crisp storyline, which is not stretched, beyond a point of time. Over-stretched Pregnancy Tracks \nThis becomes the second in the list and mandatorily needs to be changed. Usually, pregnancy tracks are introduced to add a spice to the story. Eventually, it ends up becoming too spicy which is unbearable. The recent pregnancy track in Kumkum Bhagya, wherein Tanu was pregnant was dragged for too long. \nResult: Audiences Were Bored! Dead Becomes Alive, But How? \nThis formula is usually applied to encash more TRPs. They suddenly introduce tracks wherein the dead becomes alive! Clearly with no logic behind it. Daily soaps, are a work of fiction, but dead people coming alive, is something which cannot be imagined at all and no science can explain this! Unnecessary Leaps \nThis is the most outdated formula to grab the audiences' attention, we must say. Gone are the times, when people used to be very excited about the generations leaps in their favourite shows. Leap certainly adds the required freshness to a show and increases the curiosity. But, with the leap, a lot of new faces are introduced which adds confusion to the track and eventually, it goes nowhere. Sometimes, the post-leap cast acts as gap fillers and nothing else! Evil Saas; 'Bechari' Bahu \nThis is the most over-used concept and it is unfortunate that, it exists even today. Be it Ramola Sikand (Kahin Kissi Roz) of yesteryears or the very recent Preeto (Shakti), the shows have encashed this concept completely. Even though this concept is a runaway hit, audiences hate to see our modern and educated bahus as a 'bechari' bahu who can't stand up for herself and silently bears all the tortures. When Nothing Works, Opt For A Plastic Surgery \nWhen the ratings fall, makers have always resorted to their tried and tested formula of 'plastic surgery'. In shows such as Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Kahaani Ghar Ghar Ki, this formula had worked and raked in huge numbers. Kasam, is one of those recent shows which has used this formula to bring back Kratika Sengar on the show. Uff! Too much. Content Is TRP Driven; Unique Subjects Not Appreciated \nUltimately, it's TRPs that rule the television. Shows with a 'hatke' concept are rarely appreciated. For example, shows such as Naamkaran which was critically acclaimed because of its concept and performances failed to gain the required ratings. In a process to increase the ratings, the show has lost its charm and even the character Aisha played by Barkha Sengupta was killed. The show is currently focussing on the out-of-the-box adventures of a 10-year-old, Avni. The Never Ending Memory Loss Track \nWho can forget the memory loss track of Swara in Swaragini? And the most recent - Abhi's memory loss track in Kumkum Bhagya and Anika's memory loss track in Ishqbaaz! On one hand, Pragya is trying to remind Abhi of their marriage. On the other hand, Shivaay is trying to remind Anika of their past. Well, we definitely need a break from this! The Wedding Drama \nWedding tracks try to encash the maximum TRPs for their respective shows. The audiences love to see their favourite couple getting married in a grand scale amidst all the ‘shor-sharaba'. Usually, the elaborate wedding sequences are combined with various twists to keep the audiences engaged and they end up with a bride swap or a groom swap (in case of Pardes Mein Hai Mera Dil) or the wedding is called off post a high-voltage drama. Man Becomes A Victim Of Manipulation \nCan men be manipulated easily? Well, in our daily soaps, it's a yes! Our dear rockstar Abhi easily gets manipulated by his sister Aliya or his ex-girlfriend Tanu. The same goes well with our shrewd businessman Shivaay Singh Oberoi, who believes Mrs. Kapoor's lies blindly, or Raman who easily blames Ishita for all wrong happenings in his life. Well, how on earth is this possible? Say NO Supernatural Series \nSupernatural Series Naagin might be topping the TRP charts, but certainly not winning our hearts! The poor VFX, adventures and different avatars of a shape-shifting snake (Icchadari Naagin) is unbearable! \nI rest my case. \nWhich of these changes would you like to see in your favourite TV shows?
