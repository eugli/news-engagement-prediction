LeBron James called a New York Daily News report \"trash\" that said he’s pushing management to trade for Carmelo Anthony. Kevin Love called the report a lie. \n“What do they say, a lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to put his pants on,” Love said. \nThe Daily News report published Monday said James wants Anthony even if it means trading Love. James denied that after the Cavaliers defeated the Washington Wizards 140-135 in overtime on Monday. \nMore from Cavs-Wizards:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:00:13.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
