More than 100 workers in the US have lost their jobs after taking part in last week's Day Without Immigrants protest, US media say. \nDozens of people, including construction workers and restaurant staff, reported being fired after staying at home on Thursday. \nThe protest aimed to highlight the contribution of immigrants in the US. \nOne employer told CNN his staff would have to \"pay the price\" of standing up for what they believed in. \nJim Serowski, of JVS Masonry in Commerce City, Colorado, said he had no regrets after sacking about 30 bricklayers. \n\"They were warned, 'if you do this you're hurting the company, and if you go against the team you're not a member of the team',\" he was quoted as saying. \nThe exact number of workers fired is not clear, however US outlets reported a series of sackings. Among those who said they had lost their jobs were 12 restaurant workers in Tulsa, Oklahoma, who spoke to Fox News and 18 employees at a commercial painting company in Nolensville, Tennessee, according to NBC .
