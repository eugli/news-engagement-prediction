There are no Waughs, no Gilchrist, no Hayden or Ponting and McGrath. That was the champion team who dominated the world, won three World Cups,” the 36-year-old Harbhajan said at the inaugural session of sports literary festival Xolo SporTale. \n“That Australia in the past had 11 champion players. Everyone had the ability to take on the opposition and win matches from difficult situations.” \nRead | India vs Australia: Nathan Lyon taps into R Ashwin’s skills for Test series \nHarbhajan even went on to say that apart from a couple of names he doesn’t even know most the cricketers from the current Australian side. \n“This is a namesake Aussie side. Apart from Steve Smith and David Warner, I don’t even know any other cricketer. They have four spinners in the side considering they came to play in India and if they play bad, they will lose 4-0,” he said. \nRead | India coach Anil Kumble hails players for finding way to tackle tight situations \nWhile talking about comparison between Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli, Harbhajan said they played in different eras and faced different bowlers and comparison would be unfair. \n“Still I will place Sachin Tendulkar higher than Kohli because the kind of bowlers he faced were better than what they are now,” said Harbhajan and mentioned that the standard of bowling has fallen over the years. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:11:57.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
