He would only be sacked if the wheels totally came off at Wolves and then home to Leeds.\nGary Rowett was surprisingly sacked (Photo: Action Images) Gianfranco Zola is unveiled as Birmingham City's new manager Zola was recognised as a great player at Chelsea, winning the European Cup Winners’ Cup, two FA Cups and the League Cup in seven years.\nBut his managerial career is patchy with a losing Championship play-off final at Watford his highlight.\nZola is a popular hard working figure at Birmingham and has been tasked with building an attractive, successful team.\n“I feel that I have to give more to the players,” says Zola.\n“It is difficult for me to justify all that has happened. We need to work hard and find solutions because these Birmingham fans deserve it.”\nIan Holloway had his say on things at St Andrews (Photo: 2017 Getty Images) QPR boss Ian Holloway questioned the Birmingham board’s decision making.\n“The last Birmingham manager did absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately the work you do some times doesn’t get recognised,” said Holloway. “It certainly is by the fans and they don’t know what to think at the moment.\n“Your club doesn’t belong to you I’m afraid, it belongs to someone who buys it and they’ve got carte blanche to do whatever they want.\n“We went six games without a win, but QPR fans know me and Les Ferdinand knows me.\n“But Birmingham fans won’t know anything about Mr Zola. Looking where they were in the table, why did you need to make a change?”\npoll loading Who will finish higher in the Championship this season? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Birmingham Villa Football Newsletter Follow @mirrorfootball Subscribe to our Football Gary Rowett Gianfranco Zola Birmingham City FC", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=mirrorfootball", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}"], "published": "2017-02-20T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:38:47.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
