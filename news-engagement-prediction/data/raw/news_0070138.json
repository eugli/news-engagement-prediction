SUPPLIED \nRivals put a dent in Air New Zealand's result. \nBut he believed the country had most likely reached its peak for competition, bar a couple of players that might come in at the margin. \nREAD MORE: * Air New Zealand sells 20 per cent of Virgin Australia to Chinese firm \nSome, such as United Airlines, had also begun to moderate the supply of seats during the off-season. \"I think it's been the best time to be a traveller over the last 12 months no doubt about it, and that competition has created a lot of those great prices in the marketplace. \"What I would say is I think that competition has reached a high tide water mark. DAVID WHITE/FAIRFAX NZ \nAir New Zealand chief executive Christopher Luxon says the airline has adjusted to a different competitive environment. \n\"I think pricing is still in really good shape.\" \nThat had led to an over-supply of seats which had meant a lot of price discounting, and as a result Air New Zealand's revenue fell 3 per cent. \nBut Luxon was happy with how the airline had digested that competition. \n\"It is actually a really good result because it is in the face of unprecedented competition. Ad Feedback \n\"That's the most competition that's ever entered New Zealand in 77 years of Air New Zealand's existence.\" \nThe airline said on Thursday its after-tax profit for the six months to December 31 was $256 million, down from $338m last year. \nBefore tax, earnings were the second highest for an interim period in Air New Zealand's history, which chairman Tony Carter said was impressive in the face of unprecedented competition. \nLuxon said it had been able to absorb the competition by keeping costs down - helped by low fuel prices - and through its investment over the last four or five years, such that its fleet had an average age of seven years. \nFurthermore, the company was probably about 30 per cent larger than it was a few years ago, and staff endeavoured to keep costs down as they knew it would otherwise ultimately be paid by customers in higher ticket prices. \nWithout this investment, as well as $120m in new airport lounges, Air New Zealand would not have fared so well against the competition. \n\"It pays off in the tough times.\" \nLuxon said its three new routes to Singapore, Houston and Buenos Aires had been profitable from day one, and a campaign it launched last year targeting Australian travellers to North and South America had done much better than anticipated. \nHe would not go into any new destinations the airline was considering. \nThe domestic market had been a standout, he said, driven by a strong economy, the need for a high number of tourists to be flown around the country, and by the number of events coming up, such as the World Masters Games and the British & Irish Lions rugby tour. \n\"There's a lot of activity happening in New Zealand in the next six to nine months and as a result that gives us great confidence.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:46:15.615+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
