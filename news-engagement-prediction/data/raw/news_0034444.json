The Tour, itself, is putting up the £1m prize fund for the tournament – which will be shown live on Sky Sports - as it tries to attract a sponsor or sponsors for a series of these events.\nKeith Pelley, the Tour’s chief executive, is confident that backers will be drawn to the new quick-fire style which unashamedly aims to reach out a younger audience put off by golf’s staid and pedestrian image. Pelley has made no secret of his belief that the sport must be innovative to broaden its appeal and, although a few traditionalists will inevitably blanche, the Centurion featurepiece will be radical outside the ropes as well as inside.\nIn addition to amphitheatre-style stands around the tees and greens, there will be music and pyrotechnics on the first tee and at various points around the course, with all players miked up. \"I think this is just an incredibly different way of showcasing our game,” Pelley said.\nThe event in May will have amphitheater style stands akin to those at the Waste Management Phoenix Open Credit: Getty Images “The future of it? Who knows. We wanted to experiment with a completely new format then go into the market and test that. We are delighted to bring a country versus country element to the fore. There is no question that the greatest atmosphere in golf comes at the Ryder Cup and we are keen to emulate that national fervour. This is created for a younger audience. It is for people who haven't necessarily experienced our game as much. We want to get them engaged.”\nT here is a growing feeling in golf that although it is vital to keep 72-hole, four-day strokeplay as the bedrock of the sport, the format is not entertaining enough for the wider market. “We have to continually look to modernise,” Pelley said.\n\"There will always be a 72-hole tournament, there will always be 18-hole strokeplay, that is the pinnacle of our game. But I do believe it is going to be difficult to sustain 72-hole tournaments with more than 120 players on a weekly basis. The majors will continue to grow, the World Golf Championships will grow and then there will be new formats that can be adapted by different promoters and countries to generate excitement. We are looking at making modern changes to adapt to the changing habits of consumers. If you move ahead five years from now, I can't see that players won't all be wearing microphones. Sport is moving that way, people want to hear from the stars.\"\nTiger Woods 10 most famous comebacks W hether the GolfSixes tournament will initially attract the “stars” is doubtful, particularly with The Players Championship taking place in Florida the following week. But Pelley is taking the long-term view. “It is a trial, that's what this is,\" Pelley said. \" We are in the entertainment content business with golf as our platform and GolfSixes could do for golf what twenty20 has done for cricket. could become big down the line.”\nThursday will see the start of European Tour’s World Super 6 in Perth, Australia and this will comprise 54 holes of regular stroke play before a knockout matchplay format on Sunday.
