Updated February 4, 2017 Former militant leader, Ateke Tom \nThe Federal Government through the office of the Special Adviser to the President on Amnesty has visited the community of a former militant leader, Ateke Tom, with a view to fostering the sustained peace in the Niger Delta region. \nThe Special Adviser to the President on Amnesty, Brigadier General Paul Boroh (rtd), in company of the House of Representatives Committee on the Niger Delta, met with the former militant leader and some traditional leaders in Okrika Local Government Area of Rivers State. \nThe Chairman of the committee, Representative Nassir Ahmed, said they were on the visit to clear the air on reports that the activities of the ex-militant leader was contrary to the amnesty programme of the Federal Government, as well as detrimental to peace building in the Niger Delta, an allegation Mr Ateke Tom debunked. \nSome issues discussed in the meeting bordered on the need to strengthen the peace in the region, address the concerns of former militants in line with the amnesty programme, as well as reports of a brewing crisis between the former militant leader and other ex-militants who accused him of frustrating the programme. \nTissues Of Lies \nMr Ateke Tom, however, described the reports as tissues of lies to destroy his reputation. \n“It is my name they are destroying, I stand for peace; everything they have said about me are all lies. \n“I discipline my boys if they are involved in kidnapping and other crimes. I discipline them and hand them over to the Police, that’s what I do. \n“And if you see any of my boys who stay away from me, know that that person has done something bad (because) nobody pursues peace like me”, he said. \nNo Cause For Alarm \nBriefing reporters after the meeting, Representative Ahmed avowed that there was no cause for alarm, stressing that the peace in the Niger Delta was vital to Nigeria’s development. Representative Nassir Ahmed \n“You know in every issue of family – husband and wife – there is bound to be crisis, one way or the other. \n“These are not major issues. Yes we needed some clarifications to be made and the High Chief has made those clarifications and we have also made our position known. \n“They are not major issues. We also want to use this opportunity to thank the office of the Special Adviser on Amnesty for a job well done. \n“The former militants getting their stipends and allowances and those abroad getting their school fees paid,” the lawmaker said. \nMaster Piece For Crisis Resolution \nOn his part, General Boroh restated the Federal Government’s commitment to developing the Niger Delta region. Special Adviser to the President on Amnesty, Brigadier General Paul Boroh (rtd) \n“First of all, I want to thank the President (Muhammadu Buhari) for sustaining the amnesty programme which is a master piece for crisis resolution in the Niger Delta. \n“The promise that the President made during his campaign to commit to the development of the Niger Delta and look into their concerns is in place. \n“Only two weeks ago, the Vice President visited Delta State as part of the confidence building in resolving the crisis in the Niger Delta. \n“Today we are in the creeks of Okrika doing the same thing; building the peace process and stabilising the entire region of the Niger Delta,” he said. \nThe government recent announced that the amnesty programme for former militants would end in 2018. \nHowever, some stakeholder have emphasised the need to build a more sustainable way of dealing with the agitation and maintaining peace in the Niger Delta.
