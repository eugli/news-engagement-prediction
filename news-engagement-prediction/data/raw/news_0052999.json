According to the ministry, normally workers were terminated due to closure, excess workers due to restructuring, reduction in output, merger of companies,technological changes and takeover. \nIn dealing with the issue of termination of workers, the ministry had also set up 1Malaysia Outplacement Center (1MOC) under Pembangunan Sumber Manusia Bhd (PSMB) which acted as a one-stop centre for Malaysian workers who were terminated. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:13:00.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
