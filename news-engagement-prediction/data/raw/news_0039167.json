U.S. government sources also said they believed North Korean assassins were responsible. \nThe woman arrested in the early hours of Thursday was alone when she was apprehended, a police statement said. Her Indonesian passport bore the name Siti Aishah, and gave her date of birth as February 11, 1992, and place of birth as Serang, Indonesia. The statement gave no other details. \nA Malaysian government source confirmed to Reuters that first suspect detained was the same woman whose image was captured by close circuit television footage showing her wearing a white shirt with the letters “LOL” on the front. \nHer travel documents were in the name of Doan Thi Huong, showed a birth date of May 1988 and birthplace of Nam Dinh, Vietnam. \n“Investigation continues. Actions against suspect/suspects will be taken in accordance with the law,” the police statement said. \nNORTH KOREA’S SILENCE \nThere was still no mention of Kim Jong Nam’s death in North Korean state media as of Thursday morning. At midnight, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun to mark the birthday of his father, the late leader Kim Jong Il, who died in 2011. \nSouth Korea’s intelligence agency told lawmakers in Seoul that the young and unpredictable North Korean leader had issued a “standing order” for his elder half-brother’s assassination, and that there had been a failed attempt in 2012. \nNorth Korean agents have killed rivals abroad before. And Kim Jong Nam had spoken out publicly against his family’s dynastic control of the isolated state. \nMalaysian police said Kim had been at the airport’s budget terminal to catch a flight to Macau on Monday when someone grabbed or held his face from behind, after which he felt dizzy and sought help at an information desk. \n“The cause of death is strongly suspected to be a poisoning attack,” said South Korean lawmaker Kim Byung-kee, who was briefed by the spy agency. \nMalaysian authorities rebuffed North Korean officials efforts to stop an autopsy being carried out on Kim Jong Nam, three Malaysian government sources familiar with the stand-off told Reuters. \nNo decision has been taken on whether the body will eventually be handed over to North Korea, they added. \nAccording to South Korea’s spy agency, Kim Jong Nam had been living with his second wife, under Beijing’s protection, in the Chinese territory of Macau, South Korean lawmakers said. One of them said Kim Jong Nam also had a wife and son in Beijing. \nIn Beijing, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Wednesday that China was aware of reports and closely following developments. \n(Reporting by Joseph Sipalan and A.Ananthalakshmi; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T11:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:10:02.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
