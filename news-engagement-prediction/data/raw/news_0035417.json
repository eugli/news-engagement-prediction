Suddenly the man Lions coach Warren Gatland had tagged the most influential player in world rugby found himself in a downward spiral of form and confidence. \nHe missed three tests for the All Blacks as a disciplinary measure, and never found premium form when he was ushered back for the November tour. By the end of that jaunt he had even been supplanted by TJ Perenara as Steve Hansen's first-choice No 9. Hannah Peters/Getty Images \nAaron Smith looks to wrap up TJ Perenara, a halfback he'll compete against for the All Blacks No.9 jersey. \nClearly, the incident and its ramifications had a major impact on the normally chipper little halfback. And without that spring in his step, and that belief in himself, his form slipped. \nREAD MORE: * Highlanders win Sydney thriller \nBut after an off-season break, and a chance to clear his head, he will be hoping to win back the faith of the national coaches through a strong Super Rugby campaign with the Highlanders. \nLoose forward Dan Pryor says being back with the tight southern group as they look to once again contend for top honours in Super Rugby should be just the vehicle the 28-year-old needs to add to his 58 test caps. \n\"Everyone knows when you feel natural and comfortable in your environment, you do your best, and Nuggy (Smith) is no different,\" said Pryor who is aiming at an April return to action himself after ACL surgery. \n\"He's the best in the world when he's firing. He did have a tough end [to his year] but he's come back in with the Highlanders and he's sweet as. \n\"There's nothing lingering, and no negativity. The boys give him a bit of a dig every now and then, but it's all sweet as.\" Ad Feedback \nPryor said he expected Smith to return to his best form pretty quickly with the Highlanders as they again look to work out of that combative New Zealand conference. \n\"He's happy, he's at home and nothing has changed from last year. He seems good, and I'm sure we'll see him back playing at his best before long.\" \nPryor said the way the Highlanders approached their rugby was ideal for those such as Smith and Lima Sopoaga, Waisake Naholo, Malakai Fekitoa, Liam Squire and Elliot Dixon looking to prove their mettle for higher honours. \n\"When they come back to the Landers they just feel at home, they relax and play their best when they don't even think about that stuff. The good thing about the Landers is there's no talk of the All Blacks. It's just come back and let's do our thing. There's never any of that sort of pressure for those boys.\" \nPryor also said the re-signing of skipper Ben Smith provided a massive dollop of inspiration for the southern franchise, champions in 2015 and beaten semifinalists last year. \n\"It's pretty inspiring, man, especially when you hear what he's been offered,\" added Pryor. \"He's done it all, he's won a World Cup, but he just loves the province and loves representing the Highlanders. People will shoot now for any amounts of money, but not him. It's got the boys up a bit. It's pretty inspiring stuff.\" - Sunday Star Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:01:46.959+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
