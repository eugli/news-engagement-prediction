Users who enable the feature will have to come up with a six-digit passcode. Once Two-step verification is activated, no one will be able to set up a WhatsApp account with that user's phone number without the passcode. The code will be required whenever someone logs in to that account on a new device. Currently, WhatsApp's new feature can be deactivated from the user's phone without entering the passcode. So if a user's phone is stolen their WhatsApp is not secure. However, the verification process does help to protect users from remote attempts to access their account. WhatsApp claims that its app will ask users to re-enter their code periodically to help them remember it. Once two-step verification is activated, no one will be able to set up a WhatsApp account with that user's phone number without the passcode. Currently, WhatsApp's new feature can be deactivated directly from a phone without entering the passcode. So if a user's phone is stolen their WhatsApp is not secure. However, the verification process does help to protect users from remote attempts to access their account. Though WhatsApp is widely considered one of the more secure messaging apps available, the company had a big security scare just last month. A flaw allowing Facebook and others to intercept and read encrypted messages on WhatsApp was found by a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. Facebook, the company that bought WhatsApp two years ago, claims no one can intercept WhatsApp messages, not even the company or its staff. But the way the encryption is implemented means the company could in fact read messages, the researcher claimed. WhatsApp had a big security scare just last month. A flaw allowing Facebook and others to intercept and read encrypted messages on WhatsApp was found by a researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. Pictured is Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg Campaigners called the flaw a 'huge threat to freedom of speech'. The security flaw was discovered by Tobias Boelter, a cryptography and security researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. 'If WhatsApp is asked by a government agency to disclose its messaging records, it can effectively grant access due to the change in keys,' he told The Guardian . With 'end-to-end' encryption, messages are visible only to the person who has sent them and the individuals that were meant to receive. The system works by using a 'lock' to secure messages between individuals or in a group chat. This lock is paired with a distinct 'key,' which only the sender and the recipients will have. This is designed lock out cybercriminals, hackers, 'oppressive regimes,' and even WhatsApp officials to keep your data private, the company says. But WhatsApp has the ability to force the new encryption keys to be made for offline users. It can also force the sender to re-encrypt messages with new keys and send them again for any messages that have not been marked as delivered, without the sender being aware. This re-encryption and rebroadcasting effectively allows WhatsApp to intercept and read users' messages.
