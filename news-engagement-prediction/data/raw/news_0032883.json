The Stormers scored nine tries in winning 57-40. \nThe Stormers also lost Bok centre Juan de Jongh to a suspected torn knee ligament in the match. The extent of both injuries will only be confirmed on Monday. \nBut Fleck was upset after the game. “It is a horrible blow for us‚” Fleck said. \n“Leolin was really looking forward to this season and he's just come back from an injury and he is very distraught‚” Fleck said. \n“And Juan is also not good. I will leave it to the medical staff to make their assessments‚ but it looks like he’s going to be out for several weeks also.” \nBasson’s arrival and the inclusion of Blitzboks star wing Seabelo Senatla in the squad are timely given the outside back injury situation. \nBasson has amassed 95 Super Rugby caps and has scored an impressive 35 tries in that time‚ which illustrates his abilities as a finisher. \nDirector of Rugby Gert Smal said that Basson would be a welcome addition to the Stormers’ squad this season. \n“Bjorn is a versatile player whose record speaks for itself and we are excited to add another player with proven quality‚” Smal said. \n“In Bjorn we have a player comfortable on the wing or at fullback who is one of the best around under the high ball. \n“The influence he will have on our young outside backs cannot be underestimated.” \nFormer Stormers fullback Joe Pietersen‚ who played for the Sharks last year‚ is back in Cape Town and has been training with the Stormers. But he is not part of the squad and will only be used in a ‘mentoring’ role at this stage. \nThe Stormers are also light at openside flank with Marnus Schoeman‚ who was loaned from the Pumas two weeks ago‚ suffering concussion in training last week. \n- TMG Digital/TMG Sport", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:27:59.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
