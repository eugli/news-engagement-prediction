Here’s why: Eric Trump’s trip to Uruguay cost taxpayers $97,830 in hotel bills https://t.co/90iQueorBv \n— Washington Post (@washingtonpost) February 3, 2017 \nThat $100,000 was because of Secret Service and embassy staff costs, but ThinkProgress’ Judd Legum thinks Americans are getting “fleeced” by the Trumps over it: 1. Taxpayers paid $100,000 so Eric Trump could go to Uruguay for a few days and promote a luxury tower https://t.co/ILpcwJrWPS pic.twitter.com/vTARweEaxa \n— Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) February 3, 2017 2. America, you are getting fleeced \n— Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) February 3, 2017 Trending 'Get TF outta here'! Oof: No, CNN, that is NOT Faith Hill \nWell, this is true of all First Kids, no? Did Legum ever question security costs for Malia Obama to go to Lollapalooza, for example? Or any Secret Service protection for Chelsea Clinton while she does her thing? 3. The US government is now a promotional vehicle for the Trump Org and you are paying for it \n— Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) February 3, 2017 4. A couple of Senate Republicans could pressure Trump to stop this, but only if they put the country over partisanship \n— Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) February 3, 2017 \nStop what? Secret Service protection for the Trump kids? 5. Fleecing taxpayers shouldn't really be a partisan issue though \n— Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) February 3, 2017 \nDo you know what else shouldn’t be a “partisan issue”? Security threats on the children of our presidents and how much it costs to keep them safe. \n***", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:23:18.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
