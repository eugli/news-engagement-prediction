The scammer then asked for an amount of money to be sent to him to cover the tax. This would then be followed by another request for money to cover shipping charges and so on.\nThe requests for money would continue, with a different reason given each time.\nWe would like to remind the public to be very cautious with any friend request you receive on Facebook and, as a general rule, you should delete any friend request from anyone you don’t personally know. Please also bear in mind that if an offer looks to be good to be true then it probably is. If you are concerned at any time please call us on 612612.\n– Crime Reduction Officer, PC Chris Ingham Last updated Wed 22 Feb 2017 Money Jersey", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:12:37.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
