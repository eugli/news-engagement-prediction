The key stages in the 3D reconstruction (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nAnd it's said these early gestures are responsible for the exchange of over a billion Valentine Day's cards every year, millions of roses sent, vast quantities of chocolates consumed, and huge numbers of gifts wrapped. \nAll of which are accompanied by countless declarations of love. Getting access to St Valentine's skull came through an unexpected turn of events for the researchers. \nLira, who is also president of the Brazilian Academy of Hagiology (a study of the saints) has worked with Moraes on the reconstruction of the faces of Mary Magdalene and Saint Pauline of Brazil, among others. \nHe was in Rome last October on a separate project when he stumbled across the opportunity. \n\"I was in St. Peter's Square when one of the many sellers there gave me a picture of St Valentine,\" recalled Lira, who is normally based in Cear√°, north east Brazil.

The chance to do the facial reconstruction of one of the Roman Catholic church's most important and venerated relics has been a life-long dream,\" he said. As it happens, dean of the church, Father Mtanious Hadad, was keen to authorise the procedure. In an unprecedented move the church closed its doors to the public and for 40 minutes, Lira had exclusive access but couldn't remove the skull from its resting place. Photos of the relic, which was found during the excavation of a catacomb in Rome in the early 1800s, show the limited view of the object. \nLira sent 250 snaps to Moraes who whittled them down to 43. The graphic designer used photogrammetry and spatial scaling software to map and build a 3D skull. ONLINE EMBARGO 00.01 GMT The skull held in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Rome (Photo: Caters News Agency) \nMachado forensically analysed the 3D virtual head and confirmed the ancestry, sex and age without knowing who it was. From his observations, he said it was that of a mature man. He analysed aspects such as the projected glabella (area between the eyebrows and above the nose), the sloping forehead, prominent superciliary arches (eyebrow ridge), blunt orbital ridges (located around the eye sockets), and the massive mastoid process (the temporal bone behind the ear). Age was determined by dental development. Read More Think you have chemistry? The cold science behind Valentine's Day romance However, Machado admitted: \"A complete analysis was difficult because only a small front section of the skull could be captured by photogrammetry. So, we needed to fill in the gaps.\"But given that they were unable to handle the skull, this is the best anyone is likely to do for now said the researchers. Moraes used another skull chosen for its compatibility, from a 3D digital library, to complete St Valentine's cranium. He then set about digitally adjusting and adding the anatomical details, placing soft tissue, muscle and cartilage using measurements gathered from hundreds of middle-aged men of the same ancestry, to sculpt the face. The patron saint is the inspiration for a whole lot of love (Photo: Getty) \nHe said: \"The video illustrates a process called Retopo which uses 3D mesh sculpting on the base of the face and data processing to build up all the other features. \"St Valentine's final look is based on skeletal, scientific and historical research and draws on years of my experience,\" explained Moraes, adding his involvement in the project is ironic. Brazil doesn't celebrate Valentine's Day in February. The country's carnival festivities dominate the calendar around this time of year and the equivalent day known as Dia dos Namorados is June 12. \"This year, I'm going to celebrate it with the rest of the world to mark the historic discovery,\" said Moraes while acknowledging at least two other ancient holy men are said to lay claim to being St Valentine. But Moraes dismissed the notion confidently: \"We firmly believe we've uncovered the face of the real patron saint of love and unveiled much of what he looked like when he was alive.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:11:53.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
