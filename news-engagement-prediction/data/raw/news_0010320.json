(Supplied: Huon Valley News) \nThe Channel Saints were formed out of the ashes of the catastrophic inferno which devastated the state that year. \nIn the lead-up to the day which became known as Black Tuesday, the once powerful country football clubs Kettering, Woodbridge, Margate and Snug were finding it difficult to field senior, reserves and under-17 sides in the local Kingborough competition. \nThen, on February 7, weeks out from the season opener, dozens of fires accelerated by strong winds and dry conditions took hold building into a firestorm which left 64 people dead, 900 injured, 7,000 homeless and tens of thousands of hectares burnt across the state. \nOf the dead, 62 were from southern Tasmania.

It became clear the four teams could not survive on their own. Photo: Inaugural Saints captain Bruce McGuinness flies for a mark. (Supplied: Huon Valley News) \nA crisis meeting was called where it was decided the clubs would merge to form Channel Football Club, known as the Saints. \n\"The bushfires were on February 7 and the first meeting of the club was three weeks on,\" Mike Avery, who played in the Saints' first under-17 team as a 14-year-old, said. \nIt was also agreed the local competition would disband and Channel Saints would join the Huon Football Association. \nMr Avery said even as a youngster he remembered the spirit of cooperation at the time. \n\"Football brings towns and communities together and from my observations as a 14-year-old everything just went so smoothly.\" \nRoly Proctor coached Kettering in 1966 and joined the Saints' senior midfield the following year after the merger. \nHe said community volunteers ensured the Saints survived its first years. \n\"There was a lot of work that had to go in behind the scenes to raise money,\" Mr Proctor said. \n\"We used to have nights at the Margate Hotel and raffles.\" From disaster to dominance Photo: Tents dot the Snug football oval after the 1967 fires.

I didn't know he had a Channel jumper on\". \n\"He was in opposition a few months ago.\" Photo: Steven Avery said the Saints were crucial in keeping the community alive. (ABC News: Ted O'Connor) \nBarry Keating was vice captain in the early days and remembered that despite the team's on-field success, away from football life was difficult. \n\"I had two brothers who were burnt out, my parents were burnt out and my uncle was burnt out. It wasn't real good,\" he said. \nSteve Avery captained the under-17s and said football was integral to the community's recovery process. \n\"It was quite devastating to see it all happen and what it did to the area,\" he said. \n\"It certainly knocked the community around a little bit, but at the same time the fires brought everyone together.\" Glory days long gone \nThe good times of the 1980s are a distant memory now, with the Channel Saints folding at the beginning of last year due to a critical shortage of players. \nIt is a hard reality to stomach for those who built the Saints. \nMr Proctor said the expectation for country footballers to be paid was a factor which led to the Saints downfall. \n\"Nobody does anything for nothing now. In the old association, everyone was proud to pull on the guernsey for the individual club they played for,\" he said. \nGary Loveluck agreed with his former teammate. \n\"It is sad, but money talks everyone's language ... everyone goes where the money is,\" Mr Loveluck said. \nThe Channel Football Club still operates as an entity to support junior football in the area. \nKingborough Council has agreed to chip in $1,000 towards the club's 2016 electricity bill, with a view the club can one day return to fielding teams.
