Naked, pregnant and in love, the sentiment is hard to erase from your memory. IndiaToday.in | Written by: Mohak Gupta A + A - Twitter: Olumuyiwa (@0lumuyiwa) \nThe image of Russian President Vladimir Putin embracing the US President Donald Trump from behind was projected on some buildings in New York and neighbourhoods Williamsburg and Chelsea with hashtag #LoveThroughHate. \nMore than being a part of an anti-Trump resistance which has lingered since he started campaigning for the US President post, this was a publicity stunt by a dating app. \nIt wasn't entirely a politically driven move but an ad campaign by a dating app called Hater. \nHater app matches potential dates based on the things people mutually hate. You can get yourself a date using Hater if both the persons hate a similar thing. Moreover, according to a Daily Dot report, more than 80 per cent of Hater's users say they hate Trump. Twitter: SeriouslyUS (@USseriously) \nWhen asked for a comment about the project, a representative for Hater told The Huffington Post on Twitter, \"There's a lot of animosity out there, regardless of what side you're on. We're just trying to make people laugh. Through humor, hate can turn into love.\" \nWho thought getting a date would be so easy. Just hate Trump and get yourself a date.
