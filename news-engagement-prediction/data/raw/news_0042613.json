With its plastic tablecloths and working class clientele, Le Bouche à Oreille in Bourges isn’t the typical restaurant you’d expect to earn a Michelin star. That’s because the star was never meant to go to the eatery to begin with; as The Telegraph reports, the Michelin Guide confused it with a different Le Bouche à Oreille , located about 100 miles away in Boutervilliers, a town about 40 miles southwest of Paris. \nOn a typical day, Bourges's Le Bouche à Oreille serves local workers hearty meals like lasagna, steak and chips, and beef bourguignon for about $10.50 a dish. The crowd looked quite different for the couple of days the error was listed on the Michelin Guide website; food critics and gourmands showed up to the restaurant looking for a fine dining experience, only to find something decidedly more humble. \n“Suddenly, we were rushed off our feet,\" the restaurant's owner, Véronique Jacquet, told The Telegraph . \"Reporters were coming in and then my son phoned me from Paris, where he lives. He almost died laughing. I had regulars and friends phoning up and asking why I hadn’t told them we’d won a Michelin star.” \nIf the star had indeed been meant for the Bourges brasserie, it wouldn’t have been the first time Michelin recognized a casual dining hotspot. Last year, a Singapore street food vendor selling $1.50 plates of chicken received the coveted distinction. But the plates at the intended Le Bouche à Oreille—where Brittany lobster and foie gras are staple menu items—cost about $20 to $40 more than those at the Bourges restaurant. \nIn addition to sharing a name, the two restaurants also share similar addresses: Route de la Chapelle in Bourges and Impasse de la Chapelle in Boutervilliers. The Michelin Guide called the Bourges restaurant to alert them of the mix-up once they became aware of it. Fortunately, both restaurants have had a sense of humor about the confusion. The owners of Le Bouche à Oreille in Boutervilliers invited the Bourges restaurant's staff to enjoy a meal at their eatery, and the chef promised to do the same if he’s ever in Bourges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:23:33.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
