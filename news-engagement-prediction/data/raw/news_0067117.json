The White House repeatedly refused to mention Jews in its Holocaust remembrance, and had the audacity to take offense when the world pointed out the ramifications of Holocaust denial.\" Trump's comment on Tuesday, delivered after a tour of the National Museum of African American Museum and Culture in Washington, followed bomb threats made against 11 Jewish Community Centers on Monday. Read More \"The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,\" Trump said. The JCC Association of North America said there have now been 69 threats made against 54 locations in 27 states and one Canadian province since early January. In St. Louis, officials at a Jewish cemetery reported on Monday that more than 100 grave sites had been vandalized in the previous week. The White House denounced the threats Monday evening in a statement. \"Hatred and hate-motivated violence of any kind have no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom. The President has made it abundantly clear that these actions are unacceptable,\" said White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters. And Ivanka Trump, a convert to Judaism, responded as well Monday night, tweeting that \"America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC\" Questioned about the Anne Frank Center's criticism, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that he had seen the statement. \"I wish that they had praised the President for his leadership in this area, and I think that hopefully, as time continues to go by, they recognize his commitment to civil rights, to voting rights, to equality for all Americans,\" he said. Trump, he also said, has been \"very forceful in his denunciation\" of bigotry. America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC\n— Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 20, 2017 On Tuesday, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a leading Jewish human rights group, sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking that the Justice Department launch a task force \"with the assignment of identifying and capturing the culprit or culprits who seek to terrorize American Jewry through their threats.\" The FBI addressed the issue last week, saying in a statement that it was \"investigating possible civil rights violations in connection with threats to Jewish Community Centers across the country\" and described the matter as an \"ongoing\" concern. Hillary Clinton joined the chorus early Tuesday, calling on Trump to take a more vocal role. \"JCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped,\" the former Democratic presidential candidate said in a tweet. \"Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS.\" JCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS .\n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 21, 2017 House Speaker Paul Ryan also weighed in, tweeting, \"Anti-Semitism in any form is abhorrent, and I encourage authorities nationwide to take these threats seriously.\" Anti-Semitism in any form is abhorrent, and I encourage authorities nationwide to take these threats seriously.\n— Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) February 21, 2017 Trump has been presented with opportunities to denounce the threats before. During a lengthy news conference last week, a reporter from an Orthodox Jewish weekly based in New York tried to ask about \"an uptick in anti-Semitism and how the government is planning to take care of it.\" But Trump cut him off, calling the question unfair and declaring in response, \"I am the least anti-Semitic person that you've ever seen in your entire life. No. 2, racism, the least racist person.\" JUST WATCHED Trump: I am the least anti-Semitic person Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nTrump: I am the least anti-Semitic person 01:44 When the reporter tried to explain he did not mean to impugn Trump personally, he was told, \"quiet, quiet.\" It was the second straight day that the President, who had held a joint press conference with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu 24 hours earlier, had not directly addressed a question about anti-Semitism. \"This is both worrisome and puzzling,\" American Jewish Committee CEO David Harris said in a statement last week, asking that the Jewish community's concerns not be dismissed or scorned by the administration as political attacks. \"That's why the questions are being asked at press conferences, and not in order to cast aspersions on your administration,\" he added. \"But if every such question elicits either no substantive response or, mistakenly, is taken personally, then what are people of good will supposed to conclude?\"", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AnneFrankCenter/status/834072801736814592", "https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump/status/833828489442783237", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/JCC?src=hash", "https://www.dropbox.com/s/zqeykrbzw5fd8k4/JCC%20Bomb%20Threats_2017%20-%20Sheet1.pdf?dl=0", "https://twitter.com/POTUS", "http://traffic.outbrain.com/network/trackpxl?advid=814&action=view", "https://twitter.com/SpeakerRyan/status/834093968535207938", "https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/834027159148695552"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:43:01.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
