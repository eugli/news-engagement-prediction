When the news came, Aari was in Dindivanam shooting on sets created for ‘Nagesh Thiraiyarangam’. It was the last day’s shoot and even though the producer and director asked Aari to leave immediately, keeping the expenses of the producer in mind Aari decided to stay back and finish all his shots and then left. He later told newsmen that his mother was the one who wanted him to become an actor and she would have supported his decision. Touching gesture indeed from the young man in an industry where heroes stop shooting for whims and fancies.
