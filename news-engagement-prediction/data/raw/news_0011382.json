Boat fares are priced at $3/person for a single trip and each ride takes about 15 minutes. Take note that the boats to Ubin run on an irregular schedule as they only depart once they have 12 people on board. Fees are paid directly to the driver and are collected before the boat jets off. An extra $2 is charged if you bring along a bicycle. 2 Withdraw cash beforehand \nThere are no ATMs on the island, so be sure youâ€™ve got all the cash you need for the trip before jumping on a boat to Ubin. The nearest POSB and OCBC cash machines are located near the Changi Village hawker centre . 3 If you're planning to stay overnight \nSleep beneath the stars by pitching your tent at any of the two camping sites: Jelutong and Mamam. Jelutong is situated closest to the village and faces the mainland, while Mamam is further north of the island. Both locations have toilet facilities nearby, however Jelutong is the only spot that is equipped to accommodate a campfire. If you're planning to stay overnight then pop by the Pulau Ubin Police Post to register your stay with the island's officials.
