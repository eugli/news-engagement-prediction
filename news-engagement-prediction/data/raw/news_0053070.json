(LM Otero/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  35 PM \nWASHINGTON â€” The Department of Homeland Security released new policies on Tuesday outlining a major expansion of who the government views as deportation priorities. \nThe pair of memoranda call for any undocumented immigrants to be deported if they've been convicted or even charged with a criminal offense, or \"have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter before a governmental agency,\" criteria that could include offenses like traffic infractions and using fake Social Security numbers to be able to work, common offenses among undocumented immigrants. \nThe new guidelines also give immigration officials broad latitude to deport anyone who they deem \"otherwise pose(s) a risk to public safety or national security.\" \nThose guidelines codify and detail executive orders as well as longstanding promises from President Trump to rapidly escalate the number deportations of undocumented immigrants, a push that has already reportedly started with sweeps in major U.S. cities in recent weeks. \nThe memos undo Obama administration guidelines that told DHS and Immigration & Customs Enforcement agents to prioritize the deportation of those who'd committed serious crimes or are national security threats, as well as those who recently entered the country. They also greatly expand expedited removal of undocumented immigrants, allowing customs agents to deport more people faster and with fewer hurdles. The memos expand the period of expedited removal from two weeks to two years after people enter the country, and eliminate a requirement that they were within 100 miles of the border. \nPro-immigrant groups decried the new policies.

(Andrew Harnik/AP) \n\"These memos lay out a detailed blueprint for the mass deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants in America. They fulfill the wish lists of the white nationalist and anti-immigrant movements and bring to life the worst of Donald Trump's campaign rhetoric,\" America's Voice Education Fund Deputy Director Lynn Tramonte said in a statement. \nThe new policies won't be cheap, and the memos direct ICE to hire 10,000 new immigration and customs agents, as well as increase the number of detention facilities. \nNotably, the two Obama-era regulations that the new orders continue to let stand are the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allows undocumented immigrants brought here as children to remain in the country, as well as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, which allows some undocumented parents of American citizens to remain in the country. President Trump has repeatedly signaled mixed feelings about those programs, while saying last week that he plans \"to show great heart\" in dealing with DREAMers. \nThe new guidelines also called to send some immigrants caught crossing the Mexican border illegally right back across the border, even if they're not Mexicans.
