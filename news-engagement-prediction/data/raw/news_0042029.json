The social media star did just that this afternoon for her old friend Paris Hilton, who turns 36 today. \"Happy Birthday Paris Hilton!\" she captioned a black and white photo on Snapchat.

Perhaps the photo is a bigger tribute than meets the eye.\nThis isn't the first time Kim has trolled her friends with birthday posts. In September, she pulled off the same move when she greeted her assistant Stephanie Sheppard with a picture of herself.", "external_links": ["http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/07/640x1138/gallery-1487371646-hbz-kim-paris-bday-embed.png", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/07/1487371646-hbz-kim-paris-bday-embed.png", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/07/1600x800/gallery-1487371251-hbz-kim-paris-bday-index.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/07/480x853/gallery-1487371646-hbz-kim-paris-bday-embed.png"], "published": "2017-02-18T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:43:51.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
