The owner also advised she herself uses a garbage can lid as a makeshift shield when tending to Sam.\nAnother time, Jodi Smith sent her a clear message on Facebook: “Just throw food into cages. Rooster will attack!”\nMORE: Man carjacked, killed after buying candy bar; family sues Fulton store\nThe Smiths hired Gilreath again in April 2014. She was asked to retrieve eggs from the coop, and wasn’t given any additional warnings about the rooster, according to the ruling.\nDuring that stint, Gilreath approached the chicken coop. It had two signs on it.\nOne said: “Welcome.” The other: “Area patrolled by Attack Rooster Security Co.\"\nGilreath opened the door.\nThat’s when Sam charged through and set upon her, pecking and inflicting deep wounds, which caused a “serious infection,” on her legs, court documents say.\nThe pet sitter sued the Smiths.\nMORE: Man charged with murder of Atlanta rapper; victim’s dad sues security\nGilreath learned that hers wasn’t Sam’s first attack; he’d previously turned on his own loved ones, Jodi Smith and her mother, on separate occasions. Gilreath, who had at least nine years of pet-sitting experience under the name Crabapple Critters, said she “probably” wouldn’t have taken the job had she known about the attacks, the filing says.\nBut the Smiths argued Gilreath assumed the risk of the rooster attack. A trial court’s summary judgement ruled in their favor, finding Gilreath had been warned of the risk by the owners.\nThe lawsuit was dismissed.\nGilreath appealed that ruling, but it was upheld this month.", "external_links": ["https://efast.gaappeals.us/download?filingId=f2369967-0dfe-4f13-a3b5-db2c139d238d"], "published": "2017-02-28T00:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:19:55.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
