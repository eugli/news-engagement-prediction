External Link: SA Police News: Good morning from #semaphore Zulu and Valance saying hi to local swimmers \nThe predicted top temperatures could go close to becoming Canberra's hottest days ever, a record that has not been touched since 1968 when it reached 42.2C at the airport. \nSouth Australia's heatwave woes — the state is forecast to be among the hottest, with Adelaide forecast for a top of 39C today and the north pastoral districts well into the 40s — are being magnified by power outages and uncertain power supply . \nLoad shedding during extreme heat on Wednesday night resulted in 90,000 customers losing electricity supply . \nThe State Government says it is planning a dramatic intervention in the electricity market but has not yet gone into detail about what this means. \nThe Bureau of Meteorology said the extreme heatwave was moving through the southern parts of South Australia and much of Victoria, while spreading further east into New South Wales' coastal regions and south-west Queensland. Heatwaves kill far more people than other natural disasters. ABC Emergency has a checklist of things you can do to be ready. \nIn northern Victoria, temperatures were tipped to soar to 44C. \nNSW Health has urged people to stay out of the heat as much as possible and ensure they stay well hydrated, especially though the hottest parts of the day. \n\"Drink plenty of fluids, that [do not] involve alcohol or caffeine. Water is best,\" the department's Ben Scully said. \n\"If you have air-conditioning it's great to use it, otherwise keep your house cool by drawing the blinds and shutting the windows.\" \nIn contrast, Perth and Western Australia's south-west has been hit by torrential rain , causing widespread flooding and power blackouts. \nPerth has recorded more than 106 millimetres of rain since 9:00am on Thursday, making it the second wettest February day on record. \nA tropical low which formed off the Pilbara coast earlier this week before dumping more than 200 millimetres of rain on Karratha is responsible for the wild weather.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:08:21.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
