\nThat’s the biggest take-out from one of the best UEFA Champions League games there’s ever been, one where Manchester City were a Radamel Falcao spot-kick away from being down 3-1, only to storm home to win 5-3. \nDespite seeing his very attacking XI – Yaya Toure, Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva in midfield flanked by Raheem Sterling and Leroy Sane, with Fernandinho at left-back – Pep Guardiola has vowed to roll the attacking dice again in Monaco. \nFor a control freak who has built his career on tactical organisation, this display was so out of the ordinary and almost a concession of his side’s flaws – and it resulted in a spectacular offering of attacking football for those lucky enough to watch. \n“They will attack more and more and we have to defend better. But we will have our chances,” said the City manager. \n“We are going to fly to Monaco to score as many goals as possible. We are not going to defend that result. Man City's breathtaking 5th 0:39 \n“We now know each other better. We will adjust some things, they will adjust some things, but we have to score goals. \n“If we don’t score a goal in Monaco, we will be eliminated.” \nAfter witnessing a game where the Ligue 1 side broke forward with relentless speed, Monaco vice president Vadim Vasilyev said: “I’m disappointed with the result but very proud of my players. They gave everything. \n“Qualification is difficult but it is possible. It’s a great demonstration for the level of the Ligue 1. \n“The fans of football have surely feasted. I had never seen a score like that, it looked like ice hockey.” \nHere’s a manic morning of Champions League – with 14 goals across two games – wrapped in UCL Extra-Time. \nA GAME THAT HAD EVERYTHING \nIt was truly a pulsating clash, the first time eight goals have ever been scored in the first leg of a Champions League knockout tie. \nMonaco set the tone, with their rampant, high octane pressure high up the park on City’s cumbersome defenders. But the hosts, in striking first via Raheem Sterling, gave a strong hint that their offensive game was on song at the Etihad. \nLeroy Sane was magnificent, a persistent threat down the left. He produced Sterling’s opener in tandem with David Silva, who was also responsible for the killer pass for City’s final goal. \nFrom there, if the ebb and flow or glut of goals wasn’t attractive enough, we had compelling narratives: penalty controversy from both sides, Radamel Falcao’s Manchester redemption, the goal from 18-year-old Kylian Mbappe (The ‘next Henry’) and Sergio Aguero proving a point with a match winning contribution. \nIf anything summed up the ups and downs of the contest, it was John Stones. Guilty for Monaco’s third, then the hero with City’s fourth. \nBreathtaking. City edge Monaco in classic 1:17 \nGUARDIOLA’S MISTAKE GETS BIGGER \nIf leaving Claudio Bravo on the bench for the biggest game of Manchester City’s season wasn’t galling enough, then watching Willy Caballero nervously playing the ball out from the back was the biggest indictment on Guardiola’s treatment of Joe Hart. \nTrue, Caballero stood tall to deny Falcao from the penalty spot, but given the vindication for Hart’s disposal was his distribution, then regardless of what happens for City this season, this decision is one Guardiola needs to come clean on: it was a shocker. \n“Fortunately for me and the team I chose one side,” Caballero told BT Sport regarding his penalty stop. “We studied Falcao and the rest of the penalty takers a lot and I have been lucky to choose the right side. \n“I made a mistake in the first goal and we have a lot of things to improve, but we never gave up and the team was strong, even when we conceded easy goals. We stayed in the game and finished up winning the game. \n“It was a crazy game. Fortunately we won, but we have to play against this fantastic team again. \n“We have to enjoy this, but we don’t have anything yet. The most important thing is we recover our mentality and team spirit.” Falcao's brace & costly miss 1:33 \nVETERAN STRIKERS SHINE \nGabriel Jesus’s arrival at the Etihad, and Aguero’s place on the bench under Guardiola, ramped up talk that the Argentine might be on his way out under the Spaniard. \nNot with contributions like this. \nThen, having last watched Falcao in England hobbling like an old man for Manchester United, it was refreshing to see a player who arrived in England with such a lofty reputation return to Manchester displaying some of those traits. \nHe was a menace. \nHis first-half header was superbly executed and his chip, to put City up 3-2, was divine. Monaco's Colombian forward Radamel Falcao (R) Source: AFP \nFALCAO v FABINHO? \nBut why did he step up to take that unsuccessful penalty? \nTeammate Fabinho has a record of 12 from 12 from the spot this season. \nCALAMITOUS DEFENDING \nAs good as the game was, Manchester City’s defence was paper thin. \nJohn Stones was made to look an amateur by Falcao before his chip, Nicolas Otamendi was culpable for the second goal, and Caballero’s cheap giveaway was the spark for the first goal. \nGiven City’s defending, and Monaco’s breathless pace going forward with Kylian Mbappe and Thomas Lemar particularly impressive. \nStones admitted: “The three goals we conceded is something we need to work on but great team spirit, great desire and great goals from us as well.” \nOn the coverage in England, UCL winner Steven Gerrard said: “I think you’ll get away with it against most teams or three quarters of the teams in the Premier League but at the top end of the Champions League that defence won’t go on to win it in my opinion. Manchester City's goalkeeper Willy Caballero, right, saves. Source: AP \n“You almost feel sorry for City’s defenders in a way because you can see that the manger is saying to them ‘you have to play out’ and it’s almost like suicide football, so, the defenders are under pressure straight from the beginning. \n“You almost feel sorry for them in a way and I think the manager at some stage has got to take a bit of heat off them and go long at times.” \nAt the other end, the last thing Monaco needed after Falcao’s miss was to give away a cheap, game changing goal.

Saul's sizzling strike 0:38 \n“We could even have won by a higher margin but their goalkeeper pulled off two outstanding saves to deny (Antoine) Griezmann,” said Diego Simeone. “It is important to have belief when you play away from home, and I thought we had that in abundance. \n“We thought before the game that, if we attacked down our left side, we would cause their right-footed defenders problems,” he said. \n“That is exactly what we did. Leverkusen fought their way back into the game in the second half but overall it is a very satisfying evening for us.” \nLEGENDS TO MEET AGAIN \nGoalkeeping icons Iker Casillas and Gianluigi Buffon will renew a rivalry going back almost two decades when Porto host Juventus in Wednesday’s Champions League last 16. \nAge is just another number for Spaniard Casillas, 35, and 39-year-old Italian nemesis Buffon. \nBetween them they have 334 caps, 275 Champions League matches, 12 league titles, two World Cups, two European championships, three Champions Leagues, a UEFA Cup and a combined age of 74. \nThe clash at Porto’s Dragon Stadium will be the 17th in their storied careers. Before kickoff the sparring between the pair had already begun on Twitter. “What do you think about it? For me, you’re the best,” wrote Casillas of a UEFA poll on the world’s leading goalkeepers. “I’m not choosing. We’re the best,” replied Buffon.
