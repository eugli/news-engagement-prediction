The previous one occurred in the 1800s,\" President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman Martin Andanar, a native of the region, said over government radio. \nRelief effort \nDuterte flew to the region on Sunday to inspect the response effort, which officials said has shifted to relief and rehabilitation after the last of the dead and injured were pulled from the rubble. \nHe was accompanied by a military transport plane loaded with generator sets, solar lamps, high-energy biscuits, mosquito nets and blankets for the displaced residents, Marasigan said. \nEarly on Sunday, long lines of people carrying pails and jugs queued for water rations supplied by fire trucks after the quake cut off tap water supply. \n\"We're still being hit by aftershocks, and as of now we do not have tap water supply. The people are suffering,\" provincial information officer Mary Escalante told ABS-CBN television in an interview. \n\"Buildings that suffered structural damage have been closed,\" she said, adding some schools and gyms that were meant to serve as evacuation centres were among those damaged by the quake. \nThe quake also damaged bridges and roads and knocked out the power supply, though electricity was restored in most of Surigao on Saturday. \nAn average of five earthquakes, most of them undetectable except through instruments, hit daily across the Philippines, which lies on the so-called Ring of Fire, a vast Pacific Ocean region where many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. \nThe last lethal quake that hit the country measured 7.1-magnitude. It left over 220 people dead and destroyed historic churches when it struck the central islands in October 2013.
