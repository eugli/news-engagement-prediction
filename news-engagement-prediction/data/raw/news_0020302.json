Picture courtesy: Pinterest/stocksy.com \nIf there's one thing that every parent wants for their infant, it's a song to make them stop crying. \nAnd every parent around the world also knows that this is more easily wished for than achieved. \nReally, which new parent or relative hasn't tried every trick in the book (or out of it, for that matter) to stop a baby crying? From swinging and cradling, to blowing raspberries and non-stop clapping, everything has been given a try. Some of these tricks work, some don't. \nBut what if there was a specially-designed song that could definitely make your kid laugh? That would be the end of your woes, and that's just what two scientists claim to have achieved. \nAlso read: Feel stressed out? This song will reduce your anxiety by 65 per cent \nCaspar Addyman, an expert in child development, and Lauren Stewart, a musical psychologist, have cracked this code together. A British baby food manufacturing company, Cow & Gate, asked them to come up with a pop-hit that would make every baby laugh. After extensive research--and teaming up with Imogen Heap, a Grammy-winning composer and vocalist--the duo came up with The Happy Song. \nTheir research had suggested that babies respond best to an upbeat melody in a major key, with simple and repetitive lyrics. And that's just what this song delivers. \nCheck out The Happy Song, here : To get the latest entertainment news and gossip, follow us on Twitter @Showbiz_IT and Like us on facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
