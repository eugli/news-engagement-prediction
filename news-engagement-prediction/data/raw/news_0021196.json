You like owning the latest and greatest technology or, if not owning, at least knowing about the best upcoming tech. \nAnd why shouldn't you? A day will come soon when everyone will want to watch their favorite TV shows and movies in an ultra crisp 3840 × 2160 resolution. \nWhile looking at 4K Blu-ray players this early in the game makes you somewhat of a tech Nostradamus (congrats on that by the way), manufacturers don't have the same sort of passionate drive to have the latest and greatest that you do. \nIf you're in the US, your only option in the Ultra HD disc-playing department is Samsung's brand-new UBD-K8500. 4K fans in the UK have two options, either the UBD-K8500, or the slightly more expensive Panasonic DMP-UB900. \n  while there aren't many 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray players at the moment, content for these players is growing at an exponential rate. \nNetflix has started to film many of its shows in 4K high dynamic range, and Amazon has recently followed suit. The first batch of Ultra HD films have finally made their way to store shelves, too, and include The Martian, X-Men Days of Future Past and The Revenant. \nBut these are just the tip of the very high-resolution iceberg. Expect to see a few dozen more of these high-capacity discs make their way to an electronics retailer near you in the coming weeks and months. \nOne last tip before we give you our recommendations: In order to get a true 4K experience, remember that you'll need a 4K Blu-ray player, a 4K Blu-ray disc and, of course, a 4K TV in order to watch it. Don't have that last one? Check out our guide to the best 4K TV . \nIf you don't have a 4K TV, your 4K Blu-ray player will still work, but it will only display images in 1080p. Buy a regular Blu-ray instead of a 4K version and it will still play in 3840 × 2160 resolution, but it won't be a native 4K image and will be noticeably different than had you used an Ultra HD Blu-ray. \nEnough with the caveats. Here are the the best 4K Blu-ray players in the world. 1. Samsung UBD-K8500 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray player \nThe Samsung K8500 is a solid first-gen 4K player \nSupported resolution: 3840 x 2160 | Smart TV: Samsung Smart Hub | Dimensions: 405 x 44.7 x 230 mm | Weight: 4.19 pounds | UHD Upscaling?: Yes | Wi-Fi?: Yes | 3D support?: Yes Impressive 4K HDR image quality 4K Netflix and Amazon onboard Journeyman build quality and noisy Not a great sounding music player \nThe K8500 is currently the cheapest route into 4K Blu-ray and probably offers pound-for-pound the best looking images you'll see on your 4K HDR TV. It's also a useful hub for 4K OTT services from Netflix and Amazon, and while the design is a bit Marmite, you'll be consistently impressed by its loading speed and colourful UI. \nIf you want your 4K HDR TV to look its best, then you can't beat 4K Blu-ray. And when it comes to sheer image fidelity, the UBD-K8500 certainly impresses. \nRead the full review: Samsung UBD-K8500 2. Panasonic DMP-UB900 \nPanasonic's DMP-UB900 is a must-have for AV enthusiasts \nSupported resolution: 3840 x 2160 | Smart TV: Panasonic OS | Dimensions: 435 x 199 x 68mm | Weight: 5.29 pounds | UHD Upscaling?: Yes | Wi-Fi?: Yes | 3D support?: Yes 4K Netflix and Amazon on board First-class audio CD playback Clunky UI Chassis is a fingerprint magnet \nThe DMP-UB900 will restore you faith in physical media.

Ultra-HD Blu-ray brings the experience of 4K digital cinema to the home, and rewards with brilliant colour fidelity, deep contrast and almost three-dimensional clarity. \nFactor in solid file playback support, plus 4K iterations of Netflix and Amazon Instant Video, and you have a machine that'll make your new 4K HDR TV look sensational. \nRead the full review: Panasonic DMP-UB900 3. Xbox One S \nThe Xbox One S might be primarily a video game console, but it's also a stellar (and cheap) 4K Blu-ray player \nSupported resolution: 3840 x 2160 | Smart TV: New Xbox Experience | Dimensions: 17 x 11.4 x 4.4 inches | Weight: N/A | UHD Upscaling?: Yes | Wi-Fi?: Yes | 3D support?: Yes 4K & HDR streaming HDR gaming 4K gaming limited to upscaling \nNot holding the title of a \"proper Blu-ray player\" doesn't stop the Xbox One S from being one of the best – and cheapest – ways to pop in an Ultra-HD Blu-ray disc. Sporting a Blu-ray disc drive, HDMI 2.0a HDCP2.2 ports and the capacity to run Netflix in 4K Ultra-HD, Microsoft's latest iteration of the Xbox is about as forward-thinking as you can get. \nPlus, once the curtain closes on movie night you've got an amazing game console waiting in the wings with titles like Halo 5: Guardians, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Gears of War and Forza Horizon 2 all on tap. \nRead the full review: Xbox One S 4. Oppo UDP-203 \nA premium player for your high-end A/V needs \nSupported resolution: 3840 x 2160 | Smart TV: Oppo OS | Dimensions: 16.9 x 12.2 x 3.1 inches | Weight: 9.5 pounds | UHD Upscaling?: Yes | Wi-Fi?: Yes | 3D support?: Yes Fantastic image quality Supports numerous formats (including SACD) Expensive No streaming services onboard \nThe Oppo UDP-203 is the most expensive Blu-ray player on this list, but depending on your needs it might just be exactly what you're looking for. \nThe player supports a full suite of AV formats, including the niche SACD, and features a total of three HDMI ports (one for video and audio, one for audio, and another to act as an HDMI passthrough). \nUnfortunately for a player that wants to offer everything the Oppo doesn't include support for streaming services such as Netflix, but if you want a premium disc player (at a premium price), this is the one for you. \nRead the full review: Oppo UDP-203 Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T22:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T17:50:29.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
