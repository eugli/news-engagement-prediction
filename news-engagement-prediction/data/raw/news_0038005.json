He has covered high schools, colleges and golf, winning numerous awards from the Golf Writers Association of America, Basketball Writers of America, and International Network of Golf. He was the president of the Philadelphia Sports Writers, and was inducted into the Philadelphia chapter of the National Football Foundation. When he’s not working, you’ll likely find him on a golf course. More by Mike Kern Feb 16 \nF OUR YEARS ago Methacton High's Brendan Casper had several Division II basketball scholarship offers. But his dream was something bigger. Which is why he became a preferred walk-on at Saint Joseph's instead. \nHis father Rob had played for Phil Martelli at Bishop Kenrick. And Casper had developed a relationship with Hawks assistant Dave Duda, whose daughter was also attending Methacton. Casper had already earned a partial academic scholarship to St. Joe's, and his dad was for it. Still, Martelli wanted him to be sure. \n\"We strongly suggested that he go take a scholarship and get the chance to have a really great career,\" Martelli recalled. \"We laid it out. We told him it was going to be a really tough road. But he didn't blink. He's been responsible, and accountable. He was never in awe.\" \nJust as he's never wondered about what might have been. Casper figures he's gotten everything he ever wanted from the experience. And a whole bunch more. He didn't play much as a freshman or a junior, when the Hawks were winning Atlantic 10 championships. He was their Most Improved Player as a sophomore, when they went 13-18. Now he's a senior who just earned a full ride (\"My mom cried when she found out,\" he said) and was voted a tri-captain by his teammates. \nThe 6-6 forward is averaging career highs of 16.7 minutes, 4.7 points and 3.2 rebounds a game for a 10-15 team that's been devastated by injuries, primarily in the backcourt. On Tuesday he had a career-best 13 points on 6-for-9 shooting in a 10-point loss at first-place Virginia Commonwealth. \n\"It's not like I came from a basketball factory,\" Casper said. \"I think there was one guy who scored more points than me (at Methacton), and I think he went to (D-III) Scranton. It's big for football and wrestling. We won the (Pioneer Athletic Conference) when I was a junior and made the state playoffs the next year. It was the program's first time for both. \n\"Coach Duda came and worked me out. I played against Division I kids in the summer. There's nothing wrong with Division II. But I got it in my head that I wanted to play Division I or nothing. That was it for me. It didn't matter where. The fact that it was a Big 5 school was pretty cool. I went to Villanova camps when I was younger. When (St. Joe's) said they might have a spot for me, I didn't have to hear anything else.\" \nHe came with no delusions. He'll leave with two rings, and many lifelong relationships. You think he'd trade that for additional playing time? \n\"My role is to make the other guys better,\" Casper said. \"I got close with DeAndre Bembry (the 2015-16 A-10 Player of the Year). We were the only two freshmen my first year. Last year I was the best player on the scout team. We'd go at it every day in practice. It was fun. We drove each other. He called me 'Franchise.' I thought that was pretty cool. We'd both be chirping.\" \nMartelli watched and marveled. When he wasn't worrying about them taking each other out. \n\"I'll be honest, there were days when it was torturous,\" Martelli admitted. \"I'd be sitting there saying there's no way this isn't going to end in a brawl. They would (trash) talk, they would compete, they would even get to the point where there might be a cheap shot. I used to wonder how far they'd go. Then they'd walk off with their arms wrapped around each other. It was a tribute to them both. I held my breath. But it never got stupid. DeAndre would seek (Casper) out. He wanted to play against him. \n\"I think the teams that are really good are much deeper than just their stars. When guys know what's expected of them and are able to maximize that . . . it all has to fit together. There's a lot of reasons why you win. (Casper) gets that this is a game, that it's a means to an end for him. He gets the fact that he's at a special place. And he gets that he's been treated with respect by everyone. \n\"He plays because he should play, not because he's a senior or it's a nice story or anything like that. And when he makes a mistake he gets blasted like anyone else.\" \nLike in the VCU game, when he threw a lazy lefthanded pass from the sideline to the middle that got picked off for an easy basket the other way midway through the second half that extended the Rams' lead to six. \n\"I knew it the minute I let the ball go,\" Casper said. \"I'm still upset. I know I have to be better than that. I'm our backup ballhandler now, behind (freshman forward) Nick Robinson, since (Lamarr Kimble) got hurt (last week). I haven't played point guard since high school. But it's something I'll happily do. \n\"This is easier for me. When you're not playing much, you think you have to do something or there's someone coming in right away for you. That's not a good mindset to have. Now I'm playing freer. I only have so many games left. What do I have to lose? I'm a captain. These younger guys are looking up to me, like I looked up to guys like Halil (Kanacevic), Ron (Roberts Jr.) and Langston (Galloway) when I was a freshman. Or Chris Wilson and DeAndre. They all started. I never thought the day would come when I'd be captain. It's an honor to represent the team like that. \n\"At this point in time we have to get the young guys to buy into the culture. It's been tough. We've lost some close games we might have won if we had our whole team. But you can't think about that. All you can focus on is what we have.\" \nA business administration major, Casper will soon be venturing off into the real world. Like his older brother Ryan, he plans on working in his dad's business. But before he begins the rest of his life he has some more memories to make. \n\"Winning here is everything,\" Casper said. \"I'd rather win than anything. So this year's been a little discouraging. A championship is forever. That's greater than yourself. But we all want to compete. We play for each other. Coach has never used all the injuries as an excuse. We kind of just play. Every team we play says we played hard. It motivates us, when people are saying we don't have a chance. \n\"You have to really cherish every opportunity. Because you only get so many of them. It's a privilege, absolutely. Not everybody gets the chance to play at this level. But it would be a privilege if I was playing Division II or III. It can be taken away from you like that. Look at Shavar (Newkirk). One play and he was done (on Dec. 30, with a knee injury). I could get hurt tomorrow. I'm blessed. All I wanted was a shot. It didn't matter if it was La Salle or Lafayette. I'm lucky enough it was here. It's something I think about all the time. \n\"No matter what, I will leave school saying I became the best player I could be, even though I didn't play as much. And years from now, we're going to have some great reunions.\" \nThat luck stuff, of course, is a two-way thing. \n\"In the end, my biggest thrill will be looking across the table at Brendan and his family and having them say it was worth it,\" Martelli explained. \"When we get to that day, I want everyone to look me in the eye and say they'd do it again. \n\"That's like a championship.\" \nThe reality is, he already's got that answer. \n@mikekerndn More Coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:08:06.334+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
