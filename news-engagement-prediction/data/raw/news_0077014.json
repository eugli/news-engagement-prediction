Priced at just $199, Lenovo’s new Miix 320 is designed to be a really low-cost Windows-powered laptop. Just like Microsoft’s Surface, it’s not really a laptop and it’s not really a tablet, thanks to the screen detaching from the keyboard base. \nMuch like last year’s model, the Miix 320 features a 10.1-inch full HD display with not the best viewing angles, up to 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage. Lenovo has made some improvements this time around, though. The biggest is the addition of a precision trackpad. Microsoft has been trying to convince Windows laptop makers to go precision for the past few years, and it’s surprising to see this at such a low price point. During my limited time with the device it felt fine to navigate around Windows, even if the trackpad and the device in general is a little small on the lap.\nLenovo is still offering LTE support with certain models, and up to 10 hours of battery life. There has been no change in the processor, with Intel’s Atom X5 still powering this tablet. Lenovo is planning to offer both white and silver versions of the Miix 320, and the LTE model will be available in April, followed by a non-LTE version in July. At a starting price of $199, it’s bound to be positioned as the latest Chromebook competitor for Microsoft’s Windows 10 efforts.\nGrid View", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:02:56.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
