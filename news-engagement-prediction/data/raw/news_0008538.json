What has he done that anyone else hasn’t done?” \nIn 2011‚ the ANC honoured Nongqunga by presenting him with a portrait embroidered in ANC colours for his contribution to the party’s election victory in the province. \nNongqunga said because he was not judgmental towards Zuma‚ people thought they were friends. \nNongqunga and his church was once victim to a scam by an East London couple when they were duped into paying R7 million. \nThe church’s executive committee appointed Zola Maziyana to investigate delays in payments due to the church from a Sanlam affinity financial scheme. \nMaziyana allegedly said that members of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) or Asset Forfeiture Unit were assisting him in the investigation and needed to be reimbursed for their costs. \nNongqunga transferred R6.8-million from the church’s bank account and R227 000 from his personal bank account into accounts allegedly held by his wife Zukiswa Maziyana. \nLast year‚ the NPA’s Asset Forfeiture Unit handed over a house to the church built with money allegedly stolen from it by the couple. \nOn Thursday‚ Nongqunga told the Sowetan that he was not friends with Zuma and was not a member of the ANC or any hierarchy of government.
