But it’s not all about traditional fare: From three-Michelin-star avant-garde tasting menus to hip Asian fusion to Mexican cuisine, Madrid is a place to \"discover a whirlwind of culinary offerings.\" When it comes to drinking, you’ll find plenty of vermouth and sherry in town, and if a cañaisn’t doing the trick, go ahead and make it a doble . If there’s anything Madrid lacks, its the thing tourists mistakenly come looking for: \"Avoid looking for paella,\" Móvil says. \"Madrid is definitely not the place to eat this traditional dish from Valencia.\" \nIf you’re looking for what's new and hot, head to the Heatmap . But for the restaurants, bars, and dishes that define Madrid, read on. \nPrices per person, excluding alcohol $ = Less than €25 (less than USD $26.50) $$ = €25 - €50 (USD $26.50 to USD $53) $$$ = €50 - €100 (USD $53 to USD $105) $$$$ = More than €100 (more than USD $105) 1 Sacha \nThis is the type of restaurant that makes you wish you were a regular, coming in for dinner every week and leaving in the wee hours. It offers the epitome of elevated comfort food: so-called “faux” ravioli stuffed with txangurro (king crab), marinated oysters, bone marrow with a side of sirloin, and wine — lots of wine. If you spot owner Sacha Hormaechea greeting clients, shake his hand. He’s quite the character and a great talker.
