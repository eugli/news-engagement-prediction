Lt Fredrick Lemons said investigators were looking at surveillance camera footage to help determine who had pushed over the headstones. \nThe state governor, Eric Greitens, described the attack as a cowardly act of vandalism. In a Facebook post he said: “Anyone who would seek to divide us through an act of desecration will find instead that they unite us in shared determination. From their pitiful act of ugliness, we can emerge even more powerful in our faith. \n“Whoever did this slipped into a cemetery in secret to break things. We will stand together in the open to rebuild them, stronger.” Jewish community centers in US receive nearly 50 bomb threats in 2017 so far Read more \nThe attack comes after figures released by the the JCC Association of North America showed that more than 50 bomb threats have been made against Jewish organisations in the US since January. \nDonald Trump’s administration has been accused of failing to adequately condemn antisemitism. Jewish groups scolded the president for omitting to mention Jews or antisemitism in a statement about the Holocaust . \nIn a statement released on Monday before the attack on the Missouri cemetery was reported the White House strongly condemned threats against the Jewish community. \nCNN quoted the White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters as saying: “Hatred and hate-motivated violence of any kind have no place in a country founded on the promise of individual freedom. The president has made it abundantly clear that these actions are unacceptable.” \nThe statement was a marked contrast to the response given by Trump to a Jewish reporter last week when the president dismissed a question about the rise in antisemitism as “unfair” . \nTrump’s daughter, Ivanka, converted to Judaism when she married Jared Kushner, a key adviser to her father. In a Twitter post she called for religious tolerance and protection of houses of worship and religious centres. Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers. #JCC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:14:51.949+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
