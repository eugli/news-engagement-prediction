Close Indian batsman blasts 300 in T20 match UP NEXT VIDEO Indian batsman blasts 300 in T20 match. Source: YouTube/Cricket Updates Indian batsman blasts 300 in T20 match \nCamberwell Magpies batsman Simon Hill blasted an unbeaten 137 in a total of 172 as seven of his teammates registered ducks in a game against Footscray Edgewater on Saturday. \nOnly three other players managed to score runs, while extras was the next top scorer with 17. Weirdest scorecard ever? Image: Twitter \n\"It wasn't until we were bowled out that I sat down and had a look at the scorecard, I didn't realise seven blokes had made ducks, I knew they were making not many but I didn't realise it was seven ducks,\" Hill told News Corp. \nHill amassed almost 80 per cent of the Magpies' total, beating the previous competition record held by Les Stillman, who made 181 of Melbourne Uni's 234 in 1973-74. Congratulations to @MagpiesCMCC 's Simon Hill, our men's Love the Game Player of the Week winner for his 137* in a team total of 172! pic.twitter.com/4EePPgBKS1 â€” Vic Premier Cricket (@vicpremcricket) February 13, 2017 \nCamberwell were 8-59 before Hill and No.11 Will Walker put on a 91-run ninth-wicket partnership. \n\"I think one of the major factors was that I'm one of the only left-handers in our team. Me and Will Walker (eight) are the only left-handers. Footscray were bowling some really nice outswingers to all our right-handers and we kept nicking them,\" Hill said. \nMagpies captain-coach Brendan Drew was full of praise. \n\"Records show nobody has ever seen anything like what Hilly did on Saturday, it was pretty impressive and got us out of a bind,\" he said. \nThe ridiculous scorecard is only rivalled by this one from December: Unbelievable!
