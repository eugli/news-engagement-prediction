Bowie is vying for five total awards Sunday, including alternative music album, rock performance and rock song (the latter two for the album's title song). Grammys 2017: The complete list of winners \nBefore Blackstar , Bowie had only earned one Grammy in 1985, for best short-form video for Jazzin' for Blue Jean . Prior to his five Blackstar nods, he received a total of 12 Grammy nominations throughout his five-decade career. \n\"This is his first music Grammy of any of his projects, so it's kind of shocking\" for someone who \"had such an amazing presence in the business,\" engineer Kevin Killen told reporters Sunday afternoon. \"But these things happen and I'm sure most of us that work in the business don't necessarily think about getting awards. It's just about the joy of making music and I'm sure it was for him, too.\" \nAdded mastering engineer Joe LaPorta: \"It's truly well-deserved and it has been such a long time for him to finally get this recognition.\" \nDavid Bowie has so far picked up two posthumous Grammy Awards for final album 'Blackstar.' (Photo: Justin Tallis, AFP/Getty Images) \nBowie died of cancer at age 69 on Jan. 10, 2016, days after the release of Blackstar . News of his sudden death shocked the world, although Killen says they were aware of his ailing health as they embarked on the album in January 2015. \n\"We were aware from Day 1 of the recording of David's condition, but it did not impede,\" Killen said. \"He was incredibly enthusiastic every day and really determined to make this record on his own terms, and hope that obviously, the outcome would be different. But it was an inspiration for all of us to see him do it.\" CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2kA7zMY NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
