Sometimes during rehearsals it feels like there’s three people in the room. And I do feel like Dad is still with me, every day.” \nREAD MORE: Read Steve Irwin’s touching letter to his parents, found years after his death \nBindi and her brother Robert have been following in their father’s footsteps, working with animals at the family-owned Australia Zoo. \nLast November, the Irwin family gathered at the zoo to celebrate Steve Irwin Day alongside some reptiles, and Bindi took to Instagram to share a heartfelt post.
