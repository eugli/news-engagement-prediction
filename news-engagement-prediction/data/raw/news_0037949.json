Nyquist retaliated by swinging his stick and struck Spurgeon on the left cheek with the stick blade. Nyquist was given a double-minor for high-sticking; Spurgeon was stitched up and returned to the game, which the Wild won 6-3.\nBefore the suspension was announced, Spurgeon was asked about the play at the Wild’s practice on Wednesday.\n“Obviously I was a little shocked to get a stick to the face like that,” he said. “Until you see the replay you don’t really know what happened. But [the NHL will] take care of it.’’\nSaid Wild coach Bruce Boudreau: “It doesn’t help us either way, unless they suspended him playing against us the next time.” Carlos Gonzalez, TNS - TNS The Wild and Red Wings converge as Jared Spurgeon (46) tried to get up off the ice after taking a stick to the face in the first period \nThe Wild has a game remaining against Detroit on March 26, after Nyquist’s suspension ends.\n“I had no intent to high-stick him,” Nyquist told Detroit reporters Tuesday. “This isn’t the player I am. I haven’t been in this situation before. It’s new for me. I hope people don’t think that’s the kind of player I am. It’s not fun. It won’t happen again, that’s for sure.”\nIn 317 NHL games, Nyquist has only 92 penalty minutes. His suspension will cost him $158,333 in salary.\n• Anaheim winger Antoine Vermette was automatically suspended by the league for 10 games (with a right to appeal) for physical abuse of an official in the Ducks’ 1-0 victory over the Wild on Tuesday.
