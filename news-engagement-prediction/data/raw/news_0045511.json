Each also has its drawbacks: too provincial, difficult language, inflexible labour laws. What all have in common is a desire to cash in. \nThe prize is certainly substantial: estimates of how many of the City’s 350,000-plus finance jobs could move to the continent if London loses passporting rights that allow a UK-licensed firm to trade across the EU have ranged from 35,000 to 70,000. \nBut the politics are awkward. With populist, anti-EU parties set to fare well in elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands this year, governments are understandably wary of being seen to bend the rules for bankers. \n“There’s a limit to what any of us can realistically do,” said one trade official at an EU embassy in London. “Of course everyone wants a slice of the City pie. But there aren’t many votes in giving special treatment to financiers.” The Quartier de la Défense, Paris’s major business district.

Long jealous of London’s dominant role in EU finance, the French capital sees Brexit as a unique opportunity if not to take over from the City, at least to redress a historic imbalance. \nVaunting an enviable quality of life and a sizeable finance sector of 180,000 workers, Paris, home to some of Europe’s largest banks and the Euronext Paris stock exchange, hopes to snaffle 20,000 City jobs , its lobby group Europlace said. \nFrance’s finance watchdog and securities regulator have done their bit: London-licensed operators can now get “pre-authorisation” to open in Paris within a fortnight and even do the paperwork in English. \nAs part of the same government-backed red-carpet rollout, Paris has also pushed through one of the EU’s most generous expat tax regimes, including tax breaks of up to 50%, in the hope of pulling in international high earners. \nBut while France has plainly moved on from the days when François Hollande could say his true enemy was “the world of finance”, major players remain wary of the country’s rigid employment laws . \nThe government is reportedly exploring possible workarounds, including a special hiring-and-firing regime for banks in specific EU classifications, but it remains an extremely sensitive subject. \nFrankfurt faces a similar problem. Home to the European Central Bank, the Bundesbank, the EU insurance authority and Germany’s financial regulator, it sees itself as a stable, sensible and respected European financial hub. Drab: Frankfurt is perceived as somewhat dull compared with Paris.

It boasts the EU headquarters of Google, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, plus subsidiaries of more than half the world’s leading financial services firms, according to its International Financial Services Centre. \nThe city’s pitch is also based on its belief that as the EU’s only English-language country, it is an obvious choice. Insurance companies in particular have already begun setting up subsidiaries, and Ireland’s Industrial Development Agency says more than 100 financial services companies have shown interest. \nIt, too, has its drawbacks: the city suffers from a serious shortage of quality residential and commercial property for rent. But the government is determined, unveiling in its budget last autumn a full-blown Getting Ireland Brexit Ready programme, including tax relief for foreign firms relocating staff. \nAppealingly low-tax Luxembourg , home to 143 banks with assets of some €800bn and the EU headquarters of companies such as Skype and Paypal, bills itself as “the only country that still loves bankers” and has also reported strong interest from international financial services firms exploring post-Brexit options. Amsterdam is pitching for fintech, high-frequency trading and London’s euro clearing business.

It is unashamedly going after sectors such as fintech , high-frequency trading and above all London’s euro clearing business . \nThe Dutch capital hopes its central European location and advanced digital infrastructure will attract heavily tech-reliant financial services firms that will prove a better fit for Amsterdam’s relatively sober financial culture. \nThe Netherlands has been notably tough, for example, on bankers’ bonuses, which are limited to 20% of salary, and unequivocal (in the form of a speech by finance minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem) about the fact that it is not out to attract Wall Street or City-style excess – a stance some may not appreciate. \nWhile hardly among the frontrunners, several other cities are also seeking a slice of the Brexit cake. Madrid’s #ThinkMadrid campaign – based on affordable housing, a relatively cheap, well-qualified workforce, lenient labour laws and plentiful sunshine – aims to attract some of London’s back-office functions. Vilnius is hoping to attract support functions in banking.

Instead, if the UK finds itself outside the single market and without a special deal, financial services firms with major City operations will move some jobs and selected activities to a range of EU locations.
