If he is not speaking to the Houses of Parliament, let’s go to the people. The only person who gets screwed is the Speaker of the House of Commons.”\nIndia’s premier Narendra Modi set a precedent when he addressed 60,000 people at Wembley Stadium in 2015. Then Prime Minister David Cameron walked on to the stage with Mr Modi to huge cheers from the gathered crowd.\nUnder plans for the Trump rally, cheerleaders from America’s National Football League would perform.\nLast week, Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Metropolitan Police chief, said he had concerns about the state visit given the level of protests expected.\nA large coalition of 28 left wing groups – including the Communist Party of Great Britain, the Egyptian revolution committee and the Venezuela Solidarity Campaign – is meeting with Labour Party representatives to plan the opposition to President Trump.\nLindsey German, speaking for the Stand Up to Trump movement, told The Sunday Telegraph the protests would be the biggest since 300,000 people came out to demonstrate against George W Bush’s UK visit in 2003.\nShe said: “If he goes to Balmoral there will be a big protest there, if he goes to Windsor there will be protests there. There are millions of people in this country who don’t want him to come.”", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/x0ZqS6k4CbjxIJl7FzBSfQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_telegraph_818/4feb03b91e64d1487a92af3667d3add6", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JGOO.8StjLwLpXuS.sabvw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_telegraph_818/6666ef80c9637c16aa20c7b4da37d1ec);", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JGOO.8StjLwLpXuS.sabvw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_telegraph_818/6666ef80c9637c16aa20c7b4da37d1ec"], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T03:31:02.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
