This new Nando's option sounds rubbish. https://t.co/Kv053f7tSI — James Chalmers (@ProfChalmers) February 1, 2017 Mmm, chlorine chicken sounds delicious. https://t.co/qF5t7V9MBd — Kai MacMahon (@kaimac) February 1, 2017 Chlorine chicken... I thought my local takeaway was bad https://t.co/6I9MI8g2se — AK Nawaz (@nawazcrimehack) February 1, 2017 Interesting US is flagging up meat and chicken products as trade priorities. Not sure growth hormones and chlorine are my fave ingredients. — ruth wishart (@ruth_wishart) January 24, 2017 \n“We’re asking for our chance to compete,” Farm Bureau spokesman William Rodger told BuzzFeed . “If Britons are afraid of these techniques, they won’t buy food produced with them. That’s their right, regardless if it’s irrational.” \nAccording to a 2014 blog post from the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC), however, “there is no added-value or justification to throwing our approach overboard and paving the way for chemically treated poultry to enter our market.” What is this chicken dipped in chlorine we've been deprived of? Coq au piscine? I've always liked the smell of pool on skin. — Metin Hüseyin (@MetinHuseyin) February 1, 2017 Yum, chlorine-coated chicken. One of those delicious delicacies the dreadful EU currently prevents us from eating... https://t.co/a7DjxIicpP — Caroline Stocks (@Caroline_Stocks) February 1, 2017 Hang on, do I need an opinion on chlorinated chicken now? — Duncan Weldon (@DuncanWeldon) February 1, 2017 @SarahLudford A lot of American chicken meat is soaked in chlorine as well as injected with antibiotics while alive. No thank you. — Robert W. Pierce🇪🇺🇬🇧 (@Rob71350) January 19, 2017 \nThis isn’t the first time for the issue of chlorine washed chicken to be raised, as it has consistently been noted as a concern by those opposed to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement between the EU and US. EU - as strong equal partner - continued to refuse chlorine chicken or hormone beef in TTIP. UK alone has far less to bargain with #r4today — Jenni Dunsmore (@yennimimi) January 24, 2017 @swilliamsmp @kazjohnson yum yum chlorine soaked chicken + sugar and fat pumped full of drugs & pesticides. And we will be desperate to sign — Les Campbell (@lesvcampbell) January 21, 2017 @JolyonMaugham we need red lines. No changes to our regulations for goods. E.g. No GMO corn, chlorine chicken or over-powered hoovers. — Chris Gould (@Chr1sGould) January 23, 2017 \nWhat do you think, would you eat chlorine chicken?
