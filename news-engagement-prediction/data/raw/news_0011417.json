Another man was seen being dragged from the club by security shortly after. Bouncers and police officers then blocked off all exits from the building.\nAfter an announcement was made confusion and panic spread across the dance floor. Clubbers were locked inside for hours while police at the doors took details from everyone. Single-file queues to leave the club were over an hour and a half long. Some weren't able to leave until after 4.30am.\nMusic was shut down while the DJ gave instructions to those left inside.\nAll those trapped inside eventually had to leave one by one through a fire exit near the dance floor into a side street.\nThe entrance to the building has been cordoned off and the windows have been blocked up. Flowers have today been laid at the scene.\nLast updated Mon 6 Feb 2017 Stroud Gloucestershire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:06:36.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
