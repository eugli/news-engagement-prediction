SEE ALSO: Lindsey Lohan claims she was profiled in an airport while wearing a headscarf \nHowever, she failed to wear a hijab, or traditional headscarf, which is compulsory wear for Iranian women in public. \nDerakhshani, who is a student in Spain, will be barred from representing Iran, as well as banned from playing in any tournaments in Iran. \nSeparately, her younger brother, Borna, was also playing at the Tradewise Gibraltar Chess Festival. The 15-year-old was similarly barred from the team — a punishment for playing against Alexander Huzman, of Israel. \nIran currently does not recognise Israel as a state. \nBoth sister and brother have yet to publicly comment on the matter. \n\"As a first step, these two will be denied entry to all tournaments taking place in Iran,\" Mehrdad Pahlevanzadeh, the head of the Iranian Chess Federation, was quoted by The Washington Post as saying . \n\"And, in the name of Iran, they will no longer be allowed the opportunity to be present on the national team.\" \nSome netizens were quick to support Derakhshani. This is not right. #DorsaDerakhshani should be able to show the world how clever she is. What she looks like is only her choice ✊️ https://t.co/hL2lC3uOpa \n— cecile delarue (@ceciledelarue) February 21, 2017 Not every hero wears a cape. Some even reject to wear a veil.Dorsa Derakhshani's head may be bloody, but unbowed.
