The hiring of Dubke is expected to alleviate some of the pressure put on Spicer, the Hill reported. \nThe website for Dubke's firm describes itself as \"the premier Republican media services firm,\" and says it specializes in advertising strategy and placement for political candidates among other things. \nCrossroads Media worked with American Crossroads, a super-PAC started by Karl Rove, the former Republican White House strategist.
