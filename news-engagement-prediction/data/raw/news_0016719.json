The group even stopped its shooting by damaging the film's set at Jaigarh Fort.\nSanjay Leela Bhansali seeks Karni Sena's cooperation for shooting 'Padmavati' Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali's production team has assured Shree Rajput Karni Sena that no intimate and/or romantic scene between Alauddin Khilji and Padmavati would be shown in his movie 'Padmavati', the Karni Sena claimed here on Monday.\nThe period drama stars Ranveer Singh as Alauddin Khilji, Aditi Rao Hydari as his wife Kamala Devi, Deepika Padukone as Rani Padmavati and Shahid as Rawal Ratan Singh.\n\"I have read the script and it's not objectionable, and it's a very dignified film. He (Bhansali) is treating it with lot of dignity. I think people should see the film and decide things. The sentiments of people are highly in consideration by Sanjay sir,\" Shahid said.\nHe added, \"When he cast me, he said the characters should be presented correctly as these people are respected and loved by the people of Rajasthan . So it should be represented correctly.\"\nShahid said people will understand the essence of the film once they see it. \"It's a conjecture... I know if people will see the film they will realise it is done in the right light. That's my opinion. I hope it gets resolved,\" he said.\nWhen asked about his view regarding what happened with Bhansali on the sets of 'Padmavati', Shahid said, \"What has happened everybody has seen it, it's rather graphic and not in good taste. Having said that I don't want to add to the issues that are being dealt with, I think the right authorities are looking into it, the production is looking into it.\"\n\"I don't think anybody appreciated. I don't want to get into talking of what was there and not there,\" he said.\nHowever, Shahid avoided answering when asked if the film's script has been changed. \"There are so many rumours going on that if I go to clarify it, I will have to write a book and after going home my wife will scold me for making her wait for so long here. Whatever I had to say I said it.\"\n'Padmavati' row: Activists now want to change the title to 'Ratan Singh' 00:31\nAlia Bhatt reveals her favourite sex position 1 10 Alia Bhatt reveals her favourite sex position Bollywood actress Alia Bhatt looked fabulous while she is featured on the cover of Vogue magazine for its February 2017 issue.
