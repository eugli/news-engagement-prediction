Other players and spectators at the match, in Group 7 of the Spanish third division, could only stare in disbelief. But an overjoyed Salva ran more than half of the length of the pitch to be mobbed by his team-mates. His goal, at the start of the second half, was the only one of the game making the goalkeeper an unlikely match winner. The ball lands in the back of the net to the delight of Salva and his club team-mates Salva runs away in celebration after scoring a freak goal against rivals Villanueva del Pardillo The match was played at Villanueva del Pardillo's Los Pinos stadium in the town which lies just outside Madrid. The video of the goal quickly went viral after it was shared on social media and picked up by Spanish football websites. Netizen 'peyo5819' commented: 'Hahaha, you're a big man and 40ish but what a wonderful goal you have scored. Congratulations Salva!' Salva's goal was reminiscent of the one scored by Tottenham goalkeeper Pat Jennings against Manchester United in the 1967 FA Charity Shield. Jennings scored Spurs' second goal in the 3-3 draw, when his drop kick bounced over his opposite number Alex Stepney and into the net at Wembley. Pat Jennings (out of pictured) scored a similar goal against Manchester United back in 1967 RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T20:17:25.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
