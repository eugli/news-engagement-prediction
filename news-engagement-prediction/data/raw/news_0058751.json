The sport needed it, and it will most likely iron out a lot of the creases that needed straightening. It's not pretty, but those with and without strings of ponies are mobilising. \nAs Aurora Eastwood, editor of Polo Quarterly , suggested to me this week it is about \"the \"people\" wanting a say in how their game is run\". \n\"Not just here, but in Argentina, also,\" added the player, wife, mother and journalist. As I reported in recent weeks, current player Eduardo Novillo-Astrada, is heading towards being president of the AAP, and I am hearing that more and more current players for example now want to be on influential committees. \nThis will bear fruit in the years to come. No longer is it to be just retired \"older folk who get out there under mysterious selection procedures\", as one prominent player put it to me this week. \nIt's a time of change over the visa issues with the Home Office . And change is sometimes a good thing and brings a fresh start and new ideas. \nAnd while Polo Times and other equine magazines have intelligently tackled the visa issue without pinning the blame wholesale on the HPA as some message boards have, screaming with anger but offering few solutions, it was a reminder of the gentle countryside issues and the quintessential way in which the show, and the sport, carries on. \nIn the March issue of Polo Times , the 'Knowledge' section is \"bursting to the brim with a plethora of features, vet Gethin Maddocks provides valuable insights into frog maintenance, Lorna Edgar gives her hottest tips on spring nutrition, whilst Andrews Bowen provide insight into the cutting-edge technology used in their all-weather surfaces.\" Good to know that the mainstay is unmoved. Polo will carry on in its own genteel way this season Credit: imagesofpolo.com \nP olo Times also tackles the visa issue in its March issue. As its newsletter states \"as the Home Office decision on visas and the subsequent unfolding drama has had many writing off the 2017 season before it has already started, we caught up with some clubs, both arena and outdoor, big and smaller, to find out what they think at the cusp of one of the most debated about seasons on record in our Club Catch-Up.\" \nBryan Morrison Trophy set for March \nThe All England Polo Club, Hickstead will host The Bryan Morrison Trophy with England facing the Commonwealth in an Arena International Test Match on Mar 4. Last year, England defeated the USA in the Test Match at Hickstead. \nEngland: Harold Hodges, Jonny Good, Adolfo Casabal Commonwealth: Mikey Henderson, Ryan Pemble, Jamie Morrison \nHPA announces 2017 international dates \nThe Hurlingham Polo Association have announced the two dates England will play international games in the UK this summer. \nThe first is the International Test Match which will be played at Beaufort Polo Club on June 10, the team line-up and their opponents are yet to be announced. This event will take place as part of the Gloucestershire Festival of Polo which straddles the weekend of 10 – 11 June and is always a popular event with trade stands and lots of activities for children. The Sunday will see the Maserati Charity Polo Trophy played as well as the Javier Novillo Astrada U15 Cup. \nEngland will take on the Commonwealth in The Royal Salute Coronation Cup at Guards Polo Club on July 29. \nDonovan Stratemann Memorial \nDonovan Stratemann, a 17-year-old American player who passed away this month, has been honored by the USPA. \n“The USPA would like to honor the life of a young member of our polo family, Donovan William Stratemann, son of Chris and Sonia Stratemann, brother to Alexandra and Maya and friend to all. Donovan passed away at the age of 17 on 16 February in Wellington, Florida, due to injuries sustained in a polo accident. \n\"A reflection of the best parts of each of his parents, Donovan was a quality kid, with an infectious smile and a quiet determination and perseverance. Donovan wanted to live in Hawaii one day,” said Stratemann family friend Julio Arellano “and everyone who met him, loved him. Donovan was homeschooled in order to take care of his horses, play polo and spend time with his family. He rose before 6am every day to care for his string and accompanied his twin sister Maya on daily night checks. He loved animals and never complained when asked to help with chores.\" Follow the latest Telegraph Polo news READ MORE ABOUT:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T10:30:27.384+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
