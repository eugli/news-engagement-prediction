And great uncertainty hangs over the teeming, beleaguered capital, Kinshasa, as Congo’s president, Joseph Kabila , seems to retreat deeper into the corner he has put himself in, with no plan to leave. Just this week, the government announced that it did not have the money to hold an election in 2017, after the ruling party agreed a few weeks ago to do just that. Under Congo’s Constitution, Mr. Kabila should not even be in office now. His second and final term was over in December. He is deeply unpopular, increasingly isolated and suspected of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars through fraudulent mining deals. “None of these conflicts are directly related to each other, but they are proliferating around the country because the government is weak and contested,” said Jason Stearns, the director of the Congo Research Group, a research project based at New York University. “The government is also paranoid, which is why it feels it needs to take a hard line toward any movements,” he added. The video appears to have been filmed within the past 10 days, analysts said, during the government’s military operations to quash the Kamuina Nsapu militia. The militia is an offshoot of a local movement in Kasaï whose followers have challenged the government over local autonomy. Some of the group’s followers believe in traditional magic. It seems the video was filmed as the government soldiers were approaching about a dozen Kamuina Nsapu followers who were standing together in a rural road, chanting. “They are not scared to die, so we will show them,” one of the soldiers says. Several of the victims were wearing garlands of leaves. Analysts said they might have believed the leaves — or the chanting — would protect them from bullets. That may be one reason the people did not run or dive into the bushes when the first gunshots rang out. This week, a spokesman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Liz Throssell, said as many as 101 people , including 39 women, may have been killed in clashes in the Kasaï area. “We are deeply concerned at the reported high number of deaths, which if confirmed would suggest excessive and disproportionate use of force by the soldiers,” the statement said. \nAdvertisement Lambert Mende, Congo’s information minister, said the video was not filmed in Congo, but possibly another African country, and that it was an attempt by nongovernmental organizations “to destroy the image of the D.R.C.” \nSteve Wembi contributed from Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo.
