Rec Sometimes phrasing is everything — ask Martellus Bennett. On Tuesday afternoon, he was feeling a little reminiscent of times in the past when he met major celebrities and icons. His anecdote about Magic Johnson came off totally the wrong way. I had a conversation with Magic Johnson when I was 21 and a rookie. Damn I wish I had that 5 minutes back. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 What he’s trying to say here is that he squandered those five minutes and he wished he had used them better. Unfortunately, because “I wish I had those 5 minutes back” has become vernacular for “I wasted my time,” it came off pretty badly. He quickly tried to course correct. I wasted that 5 minutes. That same 5 minutes today would possibly be life changing. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 Oh no, Martellus, you did it again! Now you made it sound like if you only had that time back you could have used it for something much more useful than speaking to Magic Johnson. Oh dear, this isn’t going very well. Am I that much of an asshole that even when I say something nice it sounds asshole-ish? Lmfao. Y'all crazy. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 No, you’re not at all, Martellus! We love you. Just ... maybe try to phrase things a little better next time? Today in other fun Martellus Bennett anecdotes: I also was once on an elevator with Tom Hanks, Olivia Wilde, Ben Stiller and a few others. I absolutely crushed that interaction. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 I once had a small conversation with Jackie Chan and Will Smith. Well that was really mostly with Will. I couldn't understand Jackie. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 I gave Sinbad a what's up bro nod one time at a restaurant I couldn't afford to be at, at that time. Crustaceans in LA.
