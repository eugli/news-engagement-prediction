If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\"\nThe president earlier called Judge Robart's ruling \"ridiculous\", described him as a \"so-called judge\".\n\"The American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind\" - Vice-President Mike Pence In its appeal, the Justice Department said Judge Robart had overreached by \"second guessing\" the president on a national security matter.\nIt also argued that only the president could decide who can enter or stay in the US.\nThe two states challenging the restriction - Washington and Minnesota - argued that the ban was unconstitutional and denied people with valid entry documents the right to travel without due process.\nIt also violated freedom of religion rights by appearing to target Muslims, they said.\nWhat happens now - BBC's Anthony Zurcher, Washington The next step is for briefs to be filed by both sides for a formal review of Judge Robart's suspension on Monday. The Justice Department could have appealed directly to the Supreme Court on an emergency basis, but it chose not to since the appeal court is moving fairly quickly.\nIf the appeal court decides the stay is valid - perhaps as early as next week - then a Supreme Court appeal is almost certain.\nIn the meantime, everything is on hold. US immigration processes continue as they did before Mr Trump issued his executive order.\nIf it looks like this is bogging down, the president might eventually decide to modify the order rather than try to defend its legality. That's probably the most prudent course, but he's a stubborn man.\nDemocrats and some Republicans have criticised Mr Trump's comments about the country's judiciary.\nDemocratic Senator Patrick Leahy, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Mr Trump seemed \"intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis\".\nMeanwhile, Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell told CNN it was \"best to avoid criticising judges individually\".\nJudge Robart has served on the federal bench since 2004 after nomination by President George W Bush.\n\"We are very excited, we are very happy\" - Iraqi national flies to the US with his family Friday's ruling has also seen visa holders from the affected nations scramble to get flights to the US, fearing they have a slim window to enter.\nThe State Department has been reversing visa cancellations and US homeland security employees have been told by their department to comply with the ruling.\nThe ban caused confusion at US and foreign airports when it came into force.\n\"I have five things to say to you\": Immigrant rights campaigner Thanushka Yakupitiyage", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38781973", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/CD9D/production/_93973625_6b4f5d1d-0041-4fe1-b510-849d3aa3002f.jpg", "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump?lang=en-gb", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38781302"], "published": "2017-02-06T03:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:33:17.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
