(Spencer Platt / Getty Images) Amina Elahi has done it again — offended users, that is.\nAfter a former engineer said she had been sexually harassed and discriminated against while working at the company, some riders who had been on the fence finally decided to #DeleteUber. \nBut Uber also may have alienated another key group: talent the company needs to improve its culture. \nSusan Fowler Rigetti said she repeatedly reported a litany of offenses she endured as an employee, but that officials dismissed her complaints and later punished her for sharing them. \nBut after her blog post spread over the holiday weekend, Uber reacted quickly, announcing an investigation into the claims led by former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Uber board member Arianna Huffington . An Uber spokeswoman declined to comment for this article. \nFormer Uber user Bethany Pagels-Minor had been thinking about deleting the app since late January, when mass protests sprang up across the nation. Uber's decision to continue serving JFK Airport during a taxi strike in the first days of President Donald Trump 's controversial immigration ban sparked a #DeleteUber social media campaign. More than 200,000 users deleted their accounts after that incident, the New York Times reported . In the fallout, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick stepped down from Trump's business advisory council among other concessions. \nFowler's blog post was the last straw, said Pagels-Minor, who's a product manager at Chicago tech company WyzAnt and is lesbian, bi-gender and black. \n\"I was pretty disgusted,\" Pagens-Minor said. \"For me I was just like, I'm actually going to change my habits today. I'm actually going to take Lyft today.\" Delete Uber \nBethany Pagels-Minor is a product manager at Chicago tech company WyzAnt. \nBethany Pagels-Minor is a product manager at Chicago tech company WyzAnt.

As a tech industry employee, Pagels-Minor said deleted accounts and decreased usage will hit Uber where it counts: with investors who value those metrics. The company's reputation could turn off prospective employees too. \n\"If someone does something really terrible from an ethical standpoint, I'm just like, 'Damn, that company was so cool, I totally would've wanted to work for it and now I can't because they're horrible people and I just don't want to participate at all,'\" Pagels-Minor said. \nWill Caskey, a Chicago-based political consultant and part-time ride-hailing driver, said he stopped driving for Uber during the airport protests. Now that the company is in trouble for gender-based discrimination, an issue he said he cares about deeply, he remains content with his decision. These days, he drives about 20 to 30 hours a week for Lyft. \n\"I don't think that Lyft is perfect, but they're not in the news every week, which is what it's come down to with Uber with some just horrible screw-up,\" Caskey said. \"It makes me feel bad about driving for them.\" \nHe said he was able to easily make the switch away from Uber because he lives in an area where there is enough demand for Lyft that he can continue to make about $600 to $700 a week driving during morning and evening rush hour periods. Drivers in other places or circumstances may not be able to make that choice, but he said it helps him fall asleep faster. \n\"Life is too short to associate yourself with jerks,\" he said. \nStill, he holds no illusions that the user boycott and his decision to abandon the platform will affect Uber's business. In his experience, he said, the company was able to acquire new customers and drivers through a variety of incentives. Caskey said he sees Uber's failure to prevent or address discrimination as evidence that the company just doesn't prioritize these issues. \nUber could alienate every female engineer it has and fill all the spots they vacate with white men in weeks, he said. Caskey acknowledged his opinion was cynical, but said he expects the company to throw money at the problem until it goes away. \nGretchen Van Vlymen, who oversees the human resources consulting business at Chicago HR solutions firm StratEx, said an investment could be a part of the solution for Uber's current problem. It could put dollars behind new training programs for employees and managers — something fast-growing companies sometimes neglect, she said.

(Gretchen Van Vlymen photo) \n\"To some C-suite individuals ... spending money on trainings that don't have an immediate effect on their bottom line might not make sense to them,\" Van Vlymen said. \"But you have to look at it in the long-term versus the short term — to ensure you're getting some really serious return on investment there when you're making an investment in your people.\" \nAlong with the investment, codifying acceptable behaviors clearly in employee handbooks and committing to workplace training could make a difference for Uber's current employees and those who may consider joining the company in the future, Van Vlymen said. Continued passive reactions to complaints or a reputation of condoning discrimination can make a company look antiquated to progressive, cutting-edge workers, she said. \nAnd if there's anything Uber doesn't want to be, it's old school. \naelahi@chicagotribune.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:26:07.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
