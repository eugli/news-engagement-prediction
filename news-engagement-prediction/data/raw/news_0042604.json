During her time, she marvels at the entertainment and hops on a rollercoaster, all while the attendees of the park engage in a dangerously non-stop Stepford Wives -esque rhythm. They're all cheerfully in sync. They're all happily waiting to hop on the next ride. \nShot over three days at \"thrill capital of the world\" Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, CA, the all-too-jolly visit is disrupted when Perry pricks her finger on a rose and breaks out of conformity to Skip Marley 's bars about the power of the people. \n\"Chained To The Rhythm\" is the lead single from the pop star's upcoming fifth album and was co-written by Perry, Max Martin , Sia Furler , Ali Payami and Marley.
