Alicia Watts was given cigarettes by nine out of ten people she asked, and was shocked by the outcome More than ten per cent of British women smoke while pregnant and this figure is as high as 27 per cent in some northern cities such as Blackpool. It is not illegal for a pregnant woman to harm her unborn child by smoking and drinking. Some people think it should be but others say banning pregnant women from smoking would be a gross intervention by the 'nanny state' and a flagrant violation of the mother's free will as well as unenforceable. In 2014 the Court of Appeal rejected a council in Greater Manchester seeking compensation for a six-year-old girl born with brain damage due to her mother's alcoholism, arguing she was the victim of a crime. A judge ruled the girl was 'not a person' in legal terms at the time because she was still a foetus so the mother was not guilty of administering poison so as to endanger life or inflict grievous bodily harm. Nine out of ten decided to hand over a cigarette, with only one saying: 'If you're pregnant, no, no, no.' Alicia said: 'He looked down at my stomach and immediately pulled the cigarette away' Alicia said: 'I expected more people to refuse me cigarettes, or at least pretend they didn't have any to give me so I was quite surprised with the outcome. I was quite saddened by the man who said he felt guilty but gave me one anyway. If a woman so heavily pregnant asked me for a cigarette I would refuse.' DANGERS OF SMOKING WHILE PREGNANT Cigarettes can restrict the essential oxygen supply to the baby. As a result, their heart has to beat harder every time the mother smokes Dangers include: Increased risk of complications in pregnancy and birth Less likely to have a healthier pregnancy and a healthier baby Increased risk of stillbirth Baby more likely to be born too early and have to face the additional breathing, feeding and health problems that often go with being premature. Baby more likely to be born underweight: babies of women who smoke are, on average about 8oz lighter than other babies. This means they're more likely to struggle keeping warm and are more prone to infection Increased risk of cot death Each year, smoking during pregnancy in the UK causes an estimated: 2,200 premature births ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T17:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:58:43.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
