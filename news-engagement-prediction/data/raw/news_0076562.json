Departments will have several days to comment on the plan, and congressional leaders will be alerted before Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night.\nAdvertisement\nIn putting together their budget plans, White House officials are operating under the assumption that the rate of the United States’ economic growth this year will be 2.4 percent, slightly ahead of current projects but well below the 3 percent growth that Trump promised during the campaign, according to one person who has been briefed on the matter.\nFor next year, the operating assumption is only slightly higher, that person added.", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F26%2Ftrump-ask-for-major-cuts-epa-increased-spending-for-military%2FbRLCI3ye7Ym0F4SNUNXo4H%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Trump", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Trump", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F26%2Ftrump-ask-for-major-cuts-epa-increased-spending-for-military%2FbRLCI3ye7Ym0F4SNUNXo4H%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tTrump", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F26%2Ftrump-ask-for-major-cuts-epa-increased-spending-for-military%2FbRLCI3ye7Ym0F4SNUNXo4H%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F26%2Ftrump-ask-for-major-cuts-epa-increased-spending-for-military%2FbRLCI3ye7Ym0F4SNUNXo4H%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Trump"], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:08:17.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
