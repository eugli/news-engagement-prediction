A YouTube channel called ‘Concept creator’ just released a new concept video which shows off their vision of the Nokia P1. We’ve already seen some concept creations from the Concept creator team in the past, as they already released the Huawei P10 and Galaxy S8 concept videos, amongst other ones. \nIf you take a look at the embedded video down below, you’ll be able to see the unofficial Nokia P1 design, while the source also shared some of the specs their imaginary device features. This phone seems to be made out of metal and glass, while it comes with a home key below the display. Its power / lock and volume rocker keys are placed on the right-hand side of the phone’s body, and so is the dedicated physical camera key. At the bottom of the device, you’ll find not only a type-C USB 3.0 port and a 3.5mm headphone jack, but also the phone’s speaker(s). This phone comes with slim side bezels, and Nokia’s branding is present both on the back of the phone, and in the upper left corner of its front side. \nThis phone sports a 5.3-inch QHD (2560 x 1440) IGZO display, which is made by Sharp, and the phone is fueled by the Snapdragon 835 64-bit octa-core processor. The device comes in Black, Silver and White color variants, while a 3,500mAh battery is also a part of this package. Android 7.0 Nougat comes pre-installed on the Nokia P1, and on the back of the device, you’ll notice the triple LED flash. The phone also packs in 6GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, while a 22.3-megapixel camera is located on the back of this phone. The Nokia P1 is rumored to arrive during the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, though nothing has been confirmed just yet. This is, of course, not a real design of the Nokia P1, but it’s a realistic one, there’s nothing too futuristic when it comes to this design, which is kind of interesting as such concept design are usually ahead of their time.
