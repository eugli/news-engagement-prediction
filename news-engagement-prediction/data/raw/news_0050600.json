Since Trump’s election, two teachers and a school nurse have resigned after allegations they made inappropriate comments regarding undocumented residents after the election.\nThe school nurse posted her comments on a Facebook status message ; The teachers spoke in front of students.\n“We are a public education system. We receive public tax funding,” Green said in a statement. “We are required by federal and state authority to educate every student who comes into our system. Students must only provide information such as proof of residency, immunization records, and proof of age … not green cards or immigration status.\n“We fully respect the free speech and all other constitutional rights of our employees, but actions by DeKalb staff members that interfere with their ability to effectively perform their jobs or interfere with our students’ rights to receive education are simply not acceptable.\n“We value all students, no matter their birth homes or heritages. We love them, and we respect what their presence here says about the goodness and generosity of America.\n“Our diversity is our strength.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:11:57.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
