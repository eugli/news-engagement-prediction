They added she also flashed her breasts and upper part of her buttocks. \nBrittany was busted after a fellow employee, who recorded the dance on a cell phone, later showed it to a supervisor. \nFultz is facing a charge of gross sexual imposition, which is a fourth-degree felony. \nSandusky police said it was disturbing to see a 100-year-old man treated that way. \nFultz pleaded not guilty Tuesday. Her attorney says Fultz should be exonerated because it was a prank intended to make the man feel good. The attorney alleges that even though the resident has dementia, he had the capacity to say no but didn’t. \n“The man knew exactly what was going on and had no problem whatsoever with it,” defense attorney Geoffrey Oglesby said Wednesday. \nThe second caretaker wasn’t charged. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
