He has covered everything from South Jersey high schools to all the professional teams. Currently his main beat is Temple football and basketball, the Philadelphia Union, along with helping out on the other pro teams and also writing a weekly South Jersey high school column. More by Marc Narducci Feb 21 \nMatt Howard, like many incoming freshmen, thought he was sort of a hotshot when he entered Penn before the 2013-14 season. \nNow a 6-foot-4 senior, Howard recalls a freshman season that was a humbling experience, considering that he played a total of 113 minutes and missed the last nine games because of injury. \n\"It was definitely a wake-up call,\" he said. \"I thought I was the man when I first got here and realized you have to earn everything.\" \nSo Howard, who attended A.C. Flora High in Columbia, S.C., has spent every second since that freshman season attempting to earn his keep. \nHe did not start as a freshman, but he has been in the starting lineup 75 out of 79 games, including all 23 this season for the rejuvenated Quakers. \nAnd with four regular-season games left, Howard is doing his best to help the Quakers extend their season and his career. \nOnce 0-6 in the Ivy League, Penn (11-12, 4-6 Ivy) is now tied for the fourth and final playoff spot with Columbia, a team the Quakers will visit on Saturday. \nDuring Penn's four-game winning streak, Howard has scored in double figures each game, averaging 12.2 points and 7.0 rebounds. \n\"When Matt is playing well and scoring, we are a good offensive team,\" Penn coach Steve Donahue said. \"He also rebounds really well.\" \nThat second part is no small feat since Howard often gives up size when he plays the power forward position, his most frequent spot. \n\"It's definitely a battle down low and there are a lot of bumps and bruises,\" Howard said. \"It's something I embrace, being smaller than other guys and I don't back down from anybody.\" \nHe also embraces being a leader of a young team that has received sizable contributions from a number of freshmen, paced by 6-8 A.J. Brodeur, who leads the team in scoring (14.0 ppg.) and rebounding (6.8 per game). \nHoward, the Quakers' only senior rotation player, is second in both categories at 11.8 ppg. and 6.7 rebounds per game. \n\"I want to lead the young players the best I can to help the program in the future,\" he said. The immediate future looks bright, especially to Howard, who has endured his share of losing. \nPenn did not own a winning record in any of his first three seasons, going a combined 28-56. He also endured a coaching change, with Donahue now in his second season. \nNow there is a different vibe at Penn, with the Quakers in the hunt for a berth in the inaugural Ivy League playoff. \nEnrolled in the Wharton School of Business, Howard will depart Penn with a degree in finance and plenty of great basketball memories. Before putting his degree to work, Howard says he wants to give professional basketball a try, but that is now the furthest thing from his mind. \nHe is consumed with attempting to earn an Ivy League playoff spot. \n\"It is exciting,\" he said. \"This is a great opportunity to be able to do something special in these last games and I don't want to take anything for granted.\" \nHe doesn't even take playing for granted even though he is second on the Quakers in minutes played, averaging 29.7 per game. \n\"I came to Penn as a really raw, athletic player,\" he said. \"I didn't realize the skill you needed to have and the knowledge of the game you needed to have to be successful at this game.\" Published: February 21, 2017 — 5:02 PM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.
