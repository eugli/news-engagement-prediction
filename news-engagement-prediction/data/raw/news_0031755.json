But that wasn‚Äôt the end of misspellings that have been plaguing his White House his first month in office. \nWithin the past few days, a number of typos (that any college student should have caught) have been linked to the Trump Administration, making some further question the legitimacy of the office. \nOne recent #TrumpTypo that caught fire appeared in bright white font on Trump‚Äôs official inauguration poster, which is marketed through the Library of Congress. The poster incorrectly used ‚Äúto‚Äù instead of ‚Äútoo‚Äù in part of a quote by the president: \n‚ÄúNo dream is too big, no challenge is to great.‚Äù \nApparently, correct spelling was too great a challenge. There is a glaring typo in Trump's official commemorative portrait https://t.co/becqnJkBA2 pic.twitter.com/uDbaIo58eg \n‚Äî Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) February 13, 2017 Oops. The typo on Trump's official inauguration is \"to great\" https://t.co/9j5fXbsrl2 \n‚Äî USA TODAY (@USATODAY) February 13, 2017 \nThe Library of Congress has since taken the poster down from their website and said in a statement Monday they will refund anyone who purchased the erroneous version of the poster. \n‚ÄúThe Library regrets that its staff did not catch the error in the marketing materials for the poster, which were provided by the third-party vendor that created the product,‚Äù the statement says. \nWhile the typo may not be caused by Trump directly, it comes right after a series of grammar mistakes that were directly caused by Trump‚Äôs administration. In the last week, for example, a White House list of 78 terrorist attacks that had allegedly gone underreported in the media misspells numerous words such as ‚Äúattaker‚Äù (instead of ‚Äúattacker‚Äù) and ‚ÄúSan Bernadino‚Äù (instead of ‚ÄúSan Bernardino‚Äù), according to the Washington Post . \nAnd then there was the Department of Education‚Äôs Twitter misstep on Sunday, when they spelled W.E.B. Du Bois‚Äô name incorrectly, issuing an apology tweet 30 minutes later. Education must not simply teach work ‚Äì it must teach life. ‚Äì W.E.B. DeBois pic.twitter.com/Re4cWkPSFA \n‚Äî US Dept of Education (@usedgov) February 12, 2017 \nAnd when you think it can‚Äôt get worse ‚Äî it does. In the apology tweet, the Department of Education made yet another spelling error. The Department of Education just tweeted \"our deepest apologizes for the earlier typo.\" Seriously. https://t.co/3louBmImKt pic.twitter.com/wuMkZ31pv4 \n‚Äî Gizmodo (@Gizmodo) February 12, 2017 \nThe NAACP fired back, also quoting Du Bois but spelling his name correctly with capitalized letters. \"In the Days of Loose & Careless Logic, We Must Teach Thinkers to THINK.\"‚Äì William Edward Burghardt DU Bois üëèüèΩ https://t.co/3m03Vnt5C1 \n‚Äî NAACP (@NAACP) February 12, 2017 \nThe Department of Education has been in the public eye since the last week, as the Senate narrowly confirmed DeVos last Tuesday through a historic tie-breaker vote by Vice President Mike Pence.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017 \nThere have been what you might call verbal typos too. Sean Spicer just now: \"Yesterday the president had an incredibly productive set of meetings and discussions with PM Joe Trudeau of Canada.\" \n‚Äî Daniel Dale (@ddale8) February 14, 2017 \nAnd when U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May came over to visit, the White House misspelled her name. More than once. WH: Pres. Trump holds joint press conference with UK PM \"Teresa May\" at 1:00 pm ET ‚Äì misspelling her name 3x on the guidance just sent out \n‚Äî Jared Rizzi (@JaredRizzi) January 27, 2017 \nAnd to top it all off, on Tuesday USA TODAY found the White House has published incorrect versions of Trump‚Äôs executive orders. USA Today finds that several executive orders posted on the White House website don't match the official version: https://t.co/OfuDQ6nZre \n‚Äî Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) February 14, 2017 \nThe USA TODAY review turned up at least five instances in which the text of an executive order sent to the Federal Registrar ‚Äî the version that is legally valid and enforceable ‚Äî does not match the corresponding text of the White House online version. According to the review, some discrepancies including minor grammar errors while other, more significantly, included ‚Äúinaccurate or non-existent provisions of law.‚Äù \nSome have taken to Twitter to reflect on what all these careless errors mean. He's too impulsive to proofread a tweet. Not a great quality in a leader. \n‚Äî Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) February 11, 2017 not to go back to all the dumb typos coming from WH but attention to detail is so important especially with security https://t.co/lePB6GwB1o \n‚Äî Charlie Warzel (@cwarzel) February 13, 2017 \nWhatever one‚Äôs opinion, it‚Äôs clear that while some minor grammatical errors may be trivial in a college essay, they can have a much bigger impact when committed by #POTUS, or in connection with the presidency. What do you think about the #TrumpTypos?
