(Susan Walsh/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated:  14 PM \nA growing number of mental health professionals have begun to publicly question President Trump's psychological fitness — and it appears Russian leader Vladimir Putin might be taking the same route. \nSenior Kremlin staffers and retired diplomats are allegedly compiling a dossier on Trump's mental health that will be presented to Putin at some point before the two leaders sit down for their first official meeting, former Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Fedorov told NBC News. \nA date for the much-anticipated meeting has yet to be set. \n\"Very serious preparatory work is going on in the Kremlin, including a paper — seven pages — describing a psychological portrait of Trump, especially based on this last two to three months, and the last weeks,\" Fedorov told the network on Monday. \nBuzzFeed sued by Russian tech firm for Trump dossier story \nFedorov, who remains close to the Kremlin, speculated that Trump \"doesn't understand\" Putin, and advised the new American President to \"listen to the people around him, especially in the areas where he is weak.\" \nReceiving extensive briefings before sitting down with another world leader is hardly unusual, but getting detailed information on a rival's mental health is definitely out of the ordinary. \"Very serious preparatory work is going on in the Kremlin,\" Andrei Fedorov told NBC. (NBC) \nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment from the Daily News. \nWord of the psychological dossier comes less than a week after Trump held an unhinged press conference at the White House . The contentious back-and-forth with reporters prompted Democrats and mental health professionals to openly question Trump's fitness for office. \nPutin: People behind Trump dossier are 'worse than prostitutes' \nNew York City psychologist John Gartner recently launched a petition that claims Trump suffers from \"malignant narcissism.\" More than 25,900 mental health professionals had signed the online petition as of Monday evening. \nFedorov claimed that Trump's \"constant battle\" with the press has been a source of concern for the Kremlin. He also encouraged Trump to \"sort out his domestic problems\" before even thinking about scheduling a meeting with Putin. \n\"Trump cannot come to a meeting with Putin as a loser,\" he said. \"Trump cannot come to a meeting with Putin as a loser,\" Fedorov said. (Mikhail Klimentyev/AP) \nThe Trump administration has been subjected to bipartisan scrutiny over its apparent ties to the Kremlin. Michael Flynn was forced to resign last week after it became known that he had held potentially illegal conversations with a top Kremlin official, and at least three Trump associates remain under FBI investigation for perceived ties to Russia. \nSen. Al Franken admits concerns about Trump's mental health \nTrump, meanwhile, has drawn ire ever since the campaign for regularly defending and praising Putin. \nTrump has also refused to accept the U.S. intelligence community's consensus that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to help him win the White House. \nWhile many Russians celebrated Trump's election, Fedorov said the mood is beginning to change. \n\"(Trump) is dancing on thin ice,\" he said. \"It's a risky game.\" Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:34:02.541+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
