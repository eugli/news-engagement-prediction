'She was this spitting, snarling, scratching animal. She had a problem with batting people with her paws like she was boxing, but it's just her way of getting you to do what she wants. 'Eventually we got her tamed by playing with her with a toy mouse on a string and she really bonded with me. One day I was in the garden when we were still trying to keep her indoors so she got used to her new home and she suddenly appeared beside me. 'I thought I must have left the door open and took her back in and shut the door. But a few minutes later she was back out beside me.' Mr and Mrs Ellis took Muffin into their detached home in Ely, Cambridgeshire, from charity Wood Green's animal shelter in nearby Duxford when she was two The couple began to twig what was happening, but it was only when their son Andrew, 38, a software engineer, saw Muffin open the door while he was visiting and filmed her doing it on his mobile phone that they had the definitive proof. They sent the footage to Wood Green, which likes to know how its rehomed cats are getting on, and it went viral after the charity put it on their website. The couple's previous cat, Bags, was 'very laid back' and would just wait to be let out, so they never bothered getting a cat flap fitted. Muffin's owners said: 'Most cats are intelligent and can work strategies out, but she is particularly astute at figuring out how to get to where she wants to go' Mr Ellis said: 'We've never had a cat flap although there has been serious talk about getting one. There just doesn't seem to be much point now. 'The door handle has a slightly loose spring and ought to be mended, but if I did that then I think we'd have a very grumpy cat.' As Muffin has yet to master using a key, however, they can keep her in when they want to - by locking the door.
