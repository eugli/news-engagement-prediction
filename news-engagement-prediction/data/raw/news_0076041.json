Photo: Andrew Meares \nTurnbull was simultaneously oblique yet frontal. Abbott had engaged in wilful damage, political sabotage. \"...He knew exactly what he was doing and he did it,\" he said. \nThere were two more press questions on the Abbott-Newspoll problem, and the trio left. \nHis policy argument obliterated, the Prime Minister was reduced to claiming his precipitous poll dive was the fault of an otherwise irrelevant third party, to wit, Abbott. \nEven last week, Liberals were grumbling that Abbott had timed his assault to affect the survey. \nThis is a dangerous fantasy. Harder heads must surely acknowledge that voters began their march away from Coalition a long time ago - a function of poorly conceived, poorly sold policies that are unpopular and unconvincing. \nCutting pensions and family payments while proposing big, unfunded tax cuts for corporates is a task beyond even a unified government. Throw in Turnbull's transformation to attack dog against renewable energy, and the penalty rates cuts which the government backs, and it's not hard to see where the problems really are. \nA harsher truth is that Turnbull survived the 2016 election through a combination of luck and Abbott's fat 2013 margin.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:08:08.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
