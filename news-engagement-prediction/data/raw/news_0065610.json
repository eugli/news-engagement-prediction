One thing that won’t be there when the device launches on March 3rd is retro games: today the company announced that its virtual console classic games service “will not be available on Nintendo Switch at launch. We will share more information in the future.” Previous reports claimed that the Switch will eventually feature GameCube titles as part of its virtual console lineup.\nThere will be at least a few titles on the Switch’s digital eShop at launch, however. Three indie titles will be available on the 3rd, including old-school platformer Shovel Knight , its latest expansion Specter of Torment , and Wipeout -style racer Fast RMX .
