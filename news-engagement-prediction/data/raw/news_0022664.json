Robart refused the US government’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit from Microsoft challenging the constitutionality of gag orders that require the company to secretly turn over users’ emails. \nLast April, Microsoft filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice (DOJ) alleging that the government’s requests for user data and information were violating its customers’ First and Fourth Amendment rights. \nMicrosoft argues that their customers have a right to know when the government obtains a warrant to read their emails, and they have a right to tell their customers when the government has made such a request. \nThe day the company filed the lawsuit, Brad Smith, Microsoft’s chief legal officer, wrote a blog claiming that in the 18 months leading up to lawsuit, the government made 2,576 requests for information. Those orders came with a gag order, preventing the company from providing its customers with any notification that their information was shared with the government. We've filed suit this morning to protect our customers’ rights to privacy & free expression. Here's why. https://t.co/sZBFjtBmbM — Brad Smith (@BradSmi) April 14, 2016 \nSmith also noted that 68 percent of those gag orders did not have an end date, which meant that the company was forbidden from ever notifying those customers that the government obtained their private data. \nSmith argues that those requests violated their customer’s constitutional rights. \n“ These lengthy and even permanent secrecy orders violate the Fourth Amendment, which gives people and businesses the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. They also violate the First Amendment, which guarantees our right to talk to customers about how government action is affecting their data, ” Smith wrote.

Bush appointee, also recently blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order that banned individuals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T08:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:51:09.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
