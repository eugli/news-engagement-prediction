Currently my elder one is not staying with me due to some misunderstanding. \nI am staying with my son in a HDB rental flat. For the past eight to ten months my ex husband has not been paying my maintenance money properly, due to that I ended up not paying my rental money and now I am in serious problem . \nHDB has asked me to settle the full outstanding arrears of $2000 immediately by 31st March. If failed to do so, I will have to vacate my rental unit by 31st March. I hereby seek your help. \nIf you could help me in anyway to have a fund raising or some donors to settle my rental outstanding fees, if not I and my son got nowhere to go, no relatives and friends to help. \nThank you. Looking forward to your reply asap. My bro in laws aunty Jessyca Devi recommended you.
