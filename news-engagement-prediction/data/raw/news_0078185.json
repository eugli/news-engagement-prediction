The latest development comes amid claims that Mr Carswell resisted attempts by senior UKIP figures to secure a knighthood for former leader Nigel Farage. \nThe Daily Telegraph reported that in an email the MP suggested Mr Farage should settle instead for an OBE for \"services to headline writers\". \nOn Monday, the MP, who has denied trying to block a knighthood for Mr Farage, alluded to the row when he tweeted \"knight night\". \nFollowing UKIP leader Paul Nuttall's failure to win the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election last week, Mr Banks has said the party is at a \"crossroads\" and has offered to become party chairman in order to bring about a \"total rebrand\".

It is not clear whether he will seek the UKIP nomination himself or will stand as an independent. 'Working against' \nMr Farage has claimed the party's only MP has been \"totally disconnected\" from UKIP since February 2015 and it was time for him to sever his links entirely. \n\"From the date of the result of the general election, he has actively been working against UKIP,\" Mr Farage wrote about Mr Carswell in the Daily Telegraph. \n\"I think there is little future for UKIP with him staying inside this party. The time for him to go is now,\" he added. \nMr Carswell, who has urged the party to project a more positive image, has warmer relations with Mr Nuttall and several of his key advisers. Analysis: UKIP blown away in Stoke Central by-election \nCurrent UKIP chairman, Paul Oakden, said after the Stoke result that it might be years before his party can pick up another seat via a by-election. \nMr Banks criticised Mr Nuttall's tactics in the Stoke campaign, saying he wrongly adopted a \"red UKIP\" strategy, copying Labour policies on the NHS. \nThe businessman has said UKIP needs to become more professional if it is to make further headway, saying that as chairman he would bring oversee a new membership drive, install a new team of \"trained professional agents\" to focus on target seats. \nUnless this happened, he has suggested he could turn his back on the party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:44:14.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
