For the year, about 90 such threats have been received, including one against the ADL's New York headquarters. \nNo bombs were found after the latest threats.\"While this latest round of bomb threats to Jewish community centres and day schools across the country again appears to not be credible, we are nonetheless urging all Jewish institutions to review their procedures,\" ADL chief executive Jonathan Greenblatt said. \nHe described the bomb threats as \"not the only manifestation of anti-Semitism in recent weeks,\" after widespread damage to Philadelphia's Mount Carmel Cemetery, where at least 75 headstones were toppled at the weekend. \nThe burial ground has been in use since the mid-1800s by the Pennsylvania city's Jewish community. A week earlier, more than 150 headstones were damaged at a Jewish cemetery in St Louis, Missouri.
