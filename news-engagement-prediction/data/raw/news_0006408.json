ClassFMonline.com also learns that National Security Minister Albert Kan-Dapaah has called Mr Adams on phone and apologised to him over the matter saying neither he nor government sanctioned the raiding his home on Wednesday. Mr Kan-Dapaah subsequently ordered that the cars be returned and promised to sanction the officers who led the raid. “They sent the vehicles to the house around 11pm,” Mr Adams confirmed to Radio Gold on Thursday, 2 February, but noted that the caretaker of his house insisted that the cars be taken to the police station for an inventory to be taken since none was taken during the raid. Meanwhile former President John Mahama has said the “unprovoked” attacks on members and leaders of the main opposition National Democratic Congress must end. “The unprovoked attacks on NDC functionaries and supporters are needless and must end. Yesterday the National Organiser of the NDC's residence was invaded by security men from the seat of Government, the Flagstaff House in his absence, in search of vehicles when they knew very well they were on the wrong path. This must end,” Mr Mahama said in a Facebook post. On Wednesday, fifteen armed men dressed in military fatigues, suspected to be army personnel, stormed the private residence of Mr Adams and seized all his vehicles in the company of four alleged National Security officers and personnel from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA). According to Mr Adams, who said he is currently in Dubai, the soldiers ransacked his Tema Gulf City home on Wednesday afternoon and seized three Pick-Ups – two belonging to his brother – as well as two Land Cruisers. The cars, according to the soldiers, were suspected to belong to the state and were taken to the Flagstaff House. Mr Adams told Asempa FM that the soldiers were led by one Captain Tandoh who said they were acting upon orders from the Minister of National Security, Albert Kan-Dapaah and the Flagstaff House. \"Why should this animalistic behaviour go on?\" he asked in frustration. Meanwhile, Mr Adams said he personally called Mr Kan-Dapaah to enquire if he, indeed, sent any soldiers on that assignment, but the Minister answered in the negative. He said he has instructed his relatives to report the matter to the police.
