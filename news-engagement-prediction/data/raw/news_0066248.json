I know that this exists in a lot of police organizations and military organizations and it is time for change to happen.\"\nCalgary police officer resigns at emotionally charged commission meeting 'We believe you': Mayor asks officer not to resign amid questions about harassment, intimidation\n\"I believe every employee in Canada has a right to a safe and respectful workplace and the Calgary police should be no different,\" Magnus said.\n\"In order for that to happen, I think they need to acknowledge that changes need to come in the way of the culture and the way the leadership handles things. They need to start holding people accountable.\"\n'Employers have obligations,' lawyer says A lawyer involved with the complaints says that sometimes workplace issues become legal in nature.\n\"Employers have obligations and employees have rights and entitlements,\" Rachel West said.\n\"Sometimes they need lawyers involved, either in the background or the foreground, to assist them in protecting those rights, obtaining those entitlements and protecting their interests within the workforce or, if they chose to leave the workforce, in order to affect change from the outside.\"\nCalgary police chief addresses 13 complaints 11:54\nChief says he welcomes the complaints Chief Roger Chaffin welcomed the complaints.\n\"I think this is the first, big, really positive development we have had on this story,\" Chaffin told reporters at a news conference Tuesday afternoon.\n\"This is a really good opportunity for us to see specifically what the issues are ... without it, it's hard to move forward on some of these things.\"\nHe says the police have been working for years on improving these types of issues.\n\"We have taken a number of steps already,\" he said.\nChaffin said the Alberta Police Act is not helpful in some ways because it was written decades ago and could not have foreseen some of the complex human resources issues that a workplace deals with today.\nThe next step is to agree upon a third-party auditor or investigator, and the scope of an investigation, Chaffin explained.\nHe stressed that CPS members can go to him directly, adding that since he first said so publicly months earlier, some members have taken him up on the offer.\n\"It doesn't help us when things are hidden,\" he said.\n\"We are getting more people come forward.\"\nDamning 2013 workplace review\nIn October 2016, a damning 2013 workplace review surfaced showing a culture of bullying, harassment, intimidation and retaliation.\nAt the time Chaffin acknowledged that old attitudes and old police culture are likely still lingering when it comes to female officers, and need addressing.\nCalgary top cop on the defensive, again, after damning 2013 workplace review surfaces When Magnus tendered her resignation publicly in January, Chaffin refused to accept it at the meeting and asked her to take some time to reflect. Mayor Naheed Nenshi also urged her not resign.\nLast week, Coun. Diane Colley-Urquhart resigned from the Calgary Police Commission, a day after the commission chair said she may have violated its code of conduct by speaking publicly about the complaints.\nCoun. Diane Colley-Urquhart quits Calgary Police Commission\nMagnus, meanwhile, says her future with Calgary police is still unclear.\n\"I feel like I am giving up, but for my mental health and my family it is something I have to do.\"\nMORE ALBERTA NEWS | Preparation saves Alberta snowmobiler lost near Revelstoke from serious harm MORE ALBERTA NEWS | 91% vs. 47%: Why vaccination rates are so different in these neighbouring Alberta towns", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:23:29.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
