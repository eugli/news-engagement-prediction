Gregg Rector. Responding officers arrived on scene at 8:08 p.m. and were escorted to the source of the disturbance by a hotel employee. \nThe altercation, which reportedly began as a verbal fight at a Walmart, allegedly became physical at the hotel. Rector said that the female had scratches and bruises on her face. He added that the male, Richardson, cooperated with police and “was arrested without incident.” \nRichardson was released Friday after posting bond, which was set at $1,000. A court date hasn’t been scheduled. \nIt’s worth noting that Richardson was sued for assault by two women in 2013. At the time, Richardson played for the Browns after the team used the No. 3 overall pick on the Alabama running back in the 2012 draft. He went on to play for the Colts , but he hasn’t appeared in a regular-season game since the 2014 season despite summer stints with the Raiders and Ravens. He averaged 3.3 yards per carry in his career and is regarded as one of the biggest NFL busts in recent years. At Alabama, Richardson averaged 5.8 yards per carry and was a Heisman Trophy finalist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:16:31.835+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
