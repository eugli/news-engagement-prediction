The design is usually crafted to resemble each letter in the word “Google”. \nMs Penpan, who died in 2015 at the age of 89, was awarded the title of National Artist on this day in 2010. The Ministry of Culture designates Feb 24 as National Artist Day. \nMs Penpan was a native of Sakon Nakhon province. Her skill in turning fruits and other fresh food into exquisite sculpture-like art pieces was well-known for nearly half a century. Her specialty was required in royal receptions and other state-sponsored banquets. \n“Using just a carving knife, she magically transformed melons into graceful swans, mangoes into rabbits, and potatoes into ducklings,” Google writes on its Doodle page. “Nature was a favorite theme, and she often formed lotus flowers from common foods like yam beans and garlic bulbs. Her intricate sculptures were used as showstopping centerpieces and serving vessels. \n“In recognition of Sittitrai’s contributions to Thailand’s visual arts, today’s Doodle draws inspiration from her many books, including, 'The Art of Thai Vegetable and Fruit Carving'.” TAGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T11:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:44:44.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
