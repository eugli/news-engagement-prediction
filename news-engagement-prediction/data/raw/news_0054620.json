HALF of Britons have a lucky number (so what’s yours?)\nMORE: Drunk milkman crashes truck into house and car causing £40,000 worth of damage\nThe event will air live on NASA Television and the agency’s website.\nLittle else is known about the event, bar the fact that scientists from the Spitzer space telescope will be among those speaking.\nThe Spitzer space telescope spots planets in other systems by watching for the telltale signs of them ‘transiting’ – passing in front of their host stars – in infrared wavelengths.\nView photos\nPicture NASA More NASA says, ‘Spitzer marked a new age in planetary science by being the first telescope to directly detect light of planets outside of our Solar System, essentially allowing “extrasolar” planets to be directly studied and compared. The great infrared observatory has also made it possible to determine the temperatures, winds, and atmospheric compositions on these distant planets.’", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Q1_PgetgL6qVq3r6m6zJ4Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTEw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/5265acf20b3952434a0f11d1cfbb6086);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Q1_PgetgL6qVq3r6m6zJ4Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTEw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/5265acf20b3952434a0f11d1cfbb6086", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GScFJ3v1WwZ7j6IavV3J2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTQ5/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/92a618f1f5b92f2d1d2100a3facb5f8a", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:20:51.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
