Reserve System member Daniel Tarullo testifies on Capitol Hill in 2012. Manuel Balce Ceneta / AP, file \nTarullo is a voting member of the central bank's policymaking panel. \nHis resignation came after Trump took action to start easing regulations on the financial industry. \nTrump, who won the White House on a populist platform filled with jabs at Wall Street titans, said previously he would cut \"a lot\" of the changes brought about by the Dodd-Frank Act. \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer has said the rules hold back economic growth. He said Dodd-Frank is \"frankly not doing what it's supposed to do.\" \nRelated: Trump's executive order directs Treasury to submit a report on possible financial regulation changes within 120 days \nTarullo said in a meeting last year that banking regulators must defend tough rules governing Wall Street and resist efforts to dilute regulations that might prevent a future financial crisis. \n\"It is critical that we not forget our still quite recent history,\" Tarullo told a meeting of financial market researchers in Washington, referring to the 2008 housing bust that pushed global financial markets to near collapse.
