Close Gangland war inquest finds shortage of evidence UP NEXT VIDEO Gangland war inquest finds shortage of evidence. Source: 7News Gangland war inquest finds shortage of evidence \nKinniburgh, 62, was shot dead in his quiet suburban street in Kew, just before midnight in December 2003. \nHe was in grave danger at the time, but didn't know it, prosecutor Andrew Tinney SC told a Victorian Supreme Court jury. Terrence Blewitt, left, and Carl Williams, right, were both involved in the plot to kill Kinniburgh, the court heard. Photos: AAP \nThis was because the Carl Williams had arranged for Stephen John Asling, 56, and the now-dead Terrence Blewitt to kill Kinniburgh, Mr Tinney said. \nFour people, including Asling, Blewitt, Williams and another man, were all allegedly involved in the joint criminal enterprise to kill \"The Munster\". \nAsling faced the first day of his trial on Tuesday, charged with murdering Kinniburgh. \nThe jury heard Kinniburgh was understood to be a close friend of Lewis Moran, and Williams - who was killed in prison in 2010 - wanted Moran and his associates dead. Cars of murder victim's brother found in Victoria \nThe plot to kill Kinniburgh had started off as an agreement to kill Lewis Moran, Mr Tinney said. \n\"Carl Williams said in effect, well if you can't kill Lewis Moran, kill Graham Kinniburgh,\" Mr Tinney told the court on Tuesday. \n\"That's why Graham Kinniburgh was killed.\" \nOn the night he was slain, Asling and Blewitt lay in wait for Kinniburgh outside his Kew home before ambushing and killing him, the jury heard. Graham \"The Munster\" Kinniburgh was murdered during Melbourne's infamous gangland war, which kicked off in the mid 1990s. Photo: AAP \nThe court heard there was an indication Asling and Blewitt were armed with handguns when Kinniburgh was ambushed as he got out of his car. \nKinniburgh produced a gun himself to try to defend himself but was shot three times by a revolver and a semi-automatic pistol, Mr Tinney said. \nHe suffered wounds to his head and torso and died in the street outside his house, with his wife and neighbours hearing the shots. \nMr Tinney said that after the murder, Asling and Blewitt drove from the scene. \nThe defence is yet to address the jury.
