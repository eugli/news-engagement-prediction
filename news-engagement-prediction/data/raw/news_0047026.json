Before the Manchester City game when we put up a reasonable fight I’d have been in the “oh, no, we’re in trouble” camp. But in that game the belief was back – it was the best the team have played in a long while. So I think they’ll scrape through to safety. \nReasons to be hopeful We only have to do as well in terms of points as the three other teams already below us. While Simon Francis has a knock, the regular defence will be able to play in the run-in, and Artur Boruc is also looking sharper in goal. \nReasons to be worried Chelsea have let us down – taking back Nathan Aké and then not playing him. Max Gradel and Jordon Ibe have been disappointing too, but it’s the defenders who need to do much better \nIs the manager to blame? The summer signings of Eddie Howe have taken time to settle and he couldn’t bring in the players he wanted in January. Callum Wilson picking up another cruciate ligament injury was also a setback. The club’s been unlucky, but conceding 49 goals means they are where they are. \nTips for the drop Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough. Swansea \n15th : P 25 W 7 D 3 L 15 F 31 A 54 Pts 24 \nAre you going down? If you’d have asked me that question about two months ago, I’d definitely have said yes - but with new manager Paul Clement’s arrival and an incredible four wins moving us four points clear, I’m feeling rather better about things. But we’ve got to focus and keep that good run going as we prepare for a crucial March against some of the teams around us. \nReasons to be hopeful Clement has brought a totally different mentality: we’re fitter, we cover more distance, look confident and play with good organisation and an effective game plan. It makes us harder to beat. \nReasons to be worried A number of players haven’t given 100% to the cause, Bob Bradley held us back massively but the players too deserve a fair share of the blame. At least most have stepped up now. \nIs the manager to blame? Bradley deservedly took a lot of flak, we were leaking a ridiculous amount of goals. We’d probably still be bottom had we not sacked him. Clement is the complete opposite though – and a breath of fresh air. \nTips for the drop Sunderland, Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough . Middlesbrough \n16th : P 25 W 4 D 10 L 11 F 19 A 27 Pts 22 \nAre you going down? I think we may just about survive this – but there’s a good chance it will go all the way to the final whistle of the final match. \nReasons to be hopeful Our defence and organisation. On our day we are so hard to break down and defeat. It means that, when it comes down to the final day, goal difference may well be our salvation. \nReasons to be worried The lack of scoring is our huge problem – so forwards have to shoulder much of the blame. The question is can you really blame the centre-forward Álvaro Negredo when he’s a lone striker? As a crucial bridge between attack and midfield, Gastón Ramírez has to find focus again because he has the ability to be our key man. \nIs the manager to blame? Aitor Karanka will live or die by his tactics. In the end survival will justify his approach. He will need to keep his nerve, as will everyone else – players and fans alike. \nTips for the drop Sunderland, Hull and Crystal Palace. Leicester City \n17th : P 25 W 5 D 6 L 14 F 24 A 43 Pts 21 \nAre you going down? If we keep playing the way we are, without question. Not only will we go down, we’ll finish rock bottom. But surely the fairytale won’t end this way? \nReasons to be hopeful We’re the champions of England, so we still have the quality within us. Plus, two years ago, a similar group of players salvaged safety from an even worse situation. We just have to match that achievement. \nReasons to be worried Every one of last season’s heroes has stained their reputation. Only Daniel Amartey, Wilfred Ndidi and Demarai Gray come out of this with any credit at the moment. \nIs the manager to blame? Claudio Ranieri has to be responsible for quite a lot of this mess. His gambling on transfers has proved disastrous, his decision to change our philosophy was comical, his persistence with the same failing back four has been perplexing and his target for the champions to finish 17th was insulting. \nTips for the drop Hull, Crystal Palace and Sunderland . Hull City \n18th : P 25 W 5 D 5 L 15 F 22 A 49 Pts 20 \nAre you going down? For the first time this season I can actually say no – I really don’t think we are. \nReasons to be hopeful One main reason: Marco Silva. He’s galvanised the club, revitalised existing players such as Tom Huddlestone and brought in an array of signings who have something to prove. He has us playing a high-energy game that is attractive but also effective. \nReasons to be worried The underlying problems that dragged us down. The owners are the reason we were ill-prepared for the season. We didn’t have enough players, they lost Steve Bruce and then dawdled over his replacement. Signings such as Ryan Mason and Markus Henriksen haven’t settled at all and sadly won’t get the chance to this season. \nIs the manager to blame? Mike Phelan wasn’t good enough but he had no backing whatsoever. Silva is only to blame for renewed optimism. It’s the hope that kills you. \nTips for the drop Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Crystal Palace. Crystal Palace \n19th : P 25 W 5 D 4 L 16 F 32 A 46 Pts 19 \nAre you going down? It feels like we are in a tailspin and our record over the past 14 months gives no indication we will pull out of it. Yes, we have home games against Middlesbrough, Leicester and Hull to come, but we’ve been dreadful at Selhurst. That has to change. But despite it all, I think we’ll stay up. \nReasons to be hopeful The quality of the players. It’s the best squad we have ever had – it’s a disgrace we find ourselves in this situation. Hopefully the talent of Zaha, Benteke and McArthur, and the manager’s experience, will see us through. \nReasons to be worried The weak links: Hennessey, Ward, Dann, Delaney, Kelly, Cabaye and Townsend have struggled this season. \nIs the manager to blame? No. The former manager is to blame. Under Alan Pardew we gradually lost all confidence and cohesion, and we still haven’t recovered from that. Some fans raise our lack of attacking prowess under Sam Allardyce but we have to stop conceding first. \nTips for the drop Leicester, Sunderland and Hull. Sunderland \n20th : P 25 W 5 D 4 L 16 F 24 A 46 Pts 19 \nAre you going down? We’ve had four escapes in a row but I don’t see a fifth one coming this year. Poor players, no discernible tactics and a rapidly disillusioned support suggest we are heading, finally, for a spell in the Championship. \nReasons to be hopeful Jermain Defoe and Jordan Pickford. They’re at opposite ends of their careers and at opposite ends of the field, but both are class acts. If the nine who fill the gaps between could lift themselves we may just squeak through – meaning I’d be back in this slot in February 2018 answering the same questions. Perhaps the biggest cause for hope is we the have experience of dodging the hangman’s rope which our rivals do not. \nReasons to be worried Lamine Koné could have been a hero for us but has been a disappointment because he agitated for a move. Adnan Januzaj has been poor. Fabio Borini looks lost. Papy Djilobodji makes me wonder who scouted him. The owner put little money up this season – and it shows. \nIs the manager to blame? David Moyes must accept some of the blame as it goes with the job, but he has been hamstrung by a lack of finance and a horrendous string of injuries to key players such as Cattermole, Kirchhoff and Anichebe. \nTips for the drop Us, Palace and Middlesbrough – or maybe Leicester if the annual miracle occurs.
