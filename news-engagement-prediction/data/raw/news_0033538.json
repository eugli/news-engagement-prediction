So I do not think there is any need for looking at another probe,\" R Seshasayee said in a interview to CNBC-TV18 . Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka. Reuters \nDespite the ongoing drama unfolding in the media and public, Vishal Sikka said less than 10 percent, or probably around 5 percent of investors, posed question pertaining to the corporate governance issues. In fact, majority of investors were interested in knowing about the performance of the business and the role of automation, etc among others. \n\"I would say less than 10 percent, probably around 5 percent of the questions were around this particular set of matter – governance and so forth. Vast majority of the questions were about performance of the business and about the macro economic climate, the geo-political climate, role of automation and things of this nature,\" Vishal Sikka said in an interview to CNBC-TV18 . \nIn fact, the Infosys CEO described the whistleblower's letter on governance issues as a direct, reckless, malicious, slanderous and personal attack on him by diabolical minds, the Times of India report said. \n\"I will not tolerate it. It is unacceptable. If somebody attacks me personally , we will follow whatever legal recourse we have to after that,\" Sikka said in an interview to ToI . \nSikka said he won't get bogged down by the ongoing challenges as he is a Kshatriya warrior, and he will stay for a long time in the company. The bigger endeavour will be to transform business, and keep pace with the role of automation and digitisation process, which is going to have a massive impact on the IT industry over the next three, five, seven year, said Sikka. \nOn being asked whether he favoured the acquisitions of Panaya and Skava because the shareholders of these companies were his ex-SAP colleagues, Sikka clarified that third parties had evaluated these buyouts and their valuations. \n\"Panaya is a picture perfect example of the automation story that I talk about. Hasso Plattner (SAP co-founder) was an investor in Panaya. That makes no difference. Infosys was aware of the company many years before,\" said Sikka to TOI . \nOn his goal of achieving $20 billion revenue target by 2020, Sikka said it's a collective responsibility of the management team and the company. \n\"Our revenue performance, market performance is something that's the collective responsibility of the management team and the company . Yes, these are distractions we can live without. We will do our jobs,\" said Sikka. \nOn reports of Murthy hinting at having Marti Subrahmanyam on the board of Infosys as a co-chair, Seshasayee said the board will take a decision in the interest of shareholders at large, the ToI report added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:07:01.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
