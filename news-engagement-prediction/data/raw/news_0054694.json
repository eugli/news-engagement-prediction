It has also seen its net revenues increase 3.5x this fiscal. \n\n\"Building on all of these substantial gains, Snapdeal expects to be the first profitable e-commerce company in India within two years,\" the spokesperson said. It also expects Vulcan Express to turn profitable by the middle of this year.
