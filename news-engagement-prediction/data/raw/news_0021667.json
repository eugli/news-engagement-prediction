The artwork features the outline of a person who looks very similar to Gucci. A photo posted by WAKA FLOCKA (@wakaflocka) on Feb 5, 2017 at 7:02pm PST \nAfter declaring that “It’s gonna get real crazy Wednesday,” Waka was asked who he plans on taking aim at on “Was My Dawg.” He states that the record “ain’t going at Gucci” before informing listeners that he and Gucci were never “super tight.” \nHe also called out rappers who put on a fake gangster persona on the internet. \n“Fans wanna know ‘Waka, when you and Gucci making that CD?’ It ain’t never happening … The internet is not the streets,” Waka Flocka Flame said. “It’s a lot of rappers looking gangsta on the internet, but they soft in the streets. It’s a lot of stories behind rappers … It ain’t going at Gucci. Everybody think cause I put a picture up saying ‘Was my dawg’… Even before Gucci went to jail. We never was like super tight.” \nLater in the interview, Waka revealed that he “made that baby sit down” while discussing a past encounter with Gucci. \n“I haven’t been cool with Gucci since my best friend got killed,” he said. “That’s 2012. You dig what I’m saying? Gucci know how I feel about him. It was a lot of rappers in the studio when me and Gucci was going at it. And I made that baby sit down … If you wanna play tough and act like you macho and you the big dog and you this, that, and the third, cool. But the streets gonna wipe your nose every time.” \nHe also asked a question about the East Atlanta Santa filming a video in East Atlanta since his release from prison. \n“Hey, since he been out, did he shoot a video in East Atlanta? Since Gucci been out, did he shoot a video in East Atlanta? Alright. I’m exposing these folks. I ain’t no hater, I’m just exposing,” he said. \nWaka’s latest commentary comes roughly a year and a half after he revealed that he was still on good terms with Gucci . \n“Yeah, we speak,” he said, during a 2015 interview with Hot 97. “That’s my boy. At the end of the day, if Gucci [struggling broke], I still looked like a fucked up person for that. At the end of the day, my platform was with Gucci. You follow me? It’s nothing I can ever say now — Where I’m at in life, I did that. But my beginning started with Gucci.” \nWatch Waka Flocka Flame’s BBC Radio 1Xtra interview on Gucci Mane and “Was My Dawg” below.
