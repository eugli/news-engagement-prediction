Chap Goh Meh is considered by some to be the second most important day for a family reunion feast after the eve of Chinese New Year. — filepic \nLegends \nAccording to Kuala Lumpur and Selangor Chinese Assembly Hall chief secretary Tang Ah Chai, there are several legends as to why this day is celebrated. \nDuring the Han Dynasty around 208BC, the festival was only celebrated in the palace and it had a religious aspect. \nPrayers were held to mark the festival and people prayed to the deity Tai Yi. \n“The emperor used the celebration and the religious rites to show that he had the heavenly mandate to be the ruler,” said Tang \nThe palace would be adorned with lanterns during this time. \nEmperor Wen of the Han Dynasty had won the battle on the 15th day during a coup d’état and to mark his victory, he encouraged a celebration on the day. \nIt was said that the festival was also intended to spread Buddhism, and people would hang lanterns as part of the celebration. \nReunion \nAccording to Tee of the Hokkien Association, for some people, Cap Goh Meh is considered the second biggest day for reunion after the reunion feast on the eve Chinese New Year. \nIt is also the last chance for a gathering during the festive season, hence some would have reunion dinners with their family on this day.

The Lantern Festival in Taiwan is called Yuan Xiao Jie. \nChinese Valentine’s Day \nChap Goh Meh is also known as the Chinese Valentine’s Day because during ancient times, single women were not allowed to venture out of their homes except on this day. \nHence, it was the time for young ladies to be out and seen and for single men to seek a potential spouse. \nIn Malaysia, the activity of tossing mandarin oranges into a river can be seen in the Klang Valley, Malacca, Penang and other places with a large Chinese population. \nWomen would throw mandarin oranges into a river or lake, and men would scoop up the fruits. \nIn recent years, men have also taken to joining in the fun by throwing bananas. \nPeople would write their contact details on the oranges. \nAt the Taman Jaya Lake in Petaling Jaya, the annual Chap Goh Meh takes place this very evening. \nBukit Gasing assemblyman Rajiv Rishyakaran said there will be tossing of yee sang , speeches, throwing of mandarin oranges, performances by school students and a lion dance. \nAs it is just a few days away from Valentine’s Day, it may add to the romantic celebration this year. \nHowever, a check with florists at Petaling Street showed that not many are cashing in on this double celebration. Chap Goh Meh is is considered by some to be the second most important day for a family reunion feast after Chinese New Year eve. - filepic \nPrayers for a better year \nSome Taoists pray on this day for good luck. \nThe Taoist prayers are done three times a year, on Shang Yuan Jie (the 15th day of the first month in the lunar calendar), Zhong Yuan Jie (Hungry Ghost Festival) on the 15th of the seventh month, and Xia Yuan Jie on the 15th day of the 10th month. \nThere will be prayers at the Guan Di Temple and Sin Sze Si Ya Temple in the city centre. \nAccording to a worker at the Sin Sze Si Ya Temple, there will be two Taoist priests conducting prayers today and devotees will turn up to pray for better luck for the year. \nOther countries \nPeople in Vietnam, Tibet, Mongolia, and South Korea usually celebrate only the first three days of the Lunar New Year. \nWhile Tibetan new year can last up to 15 days, emphasis is placed on the first three days. \nSisca Andriani, a Hokkien from Jakarta, said the Chinese community in Indonesia would eat Lontong Chap Goh Meh, a Peranakan-Javanese dish, during this celebration. \n“The lontong (rice cake) is accompanied by other items such as chicken stew, eggs, sambal , vegetable soup and prawn crackers. \n“People usually release lanterns with wishes on the beach and pray at the temple. \n“There is also a barongsai (lion dance) performance. \n“There is usually a parade too, with people carrying Buddha statues on the street to the temple,” she said.
