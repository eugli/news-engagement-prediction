On Saturday, temperatures and winds will pick up, meaning an increased fire danger extending across much of the state,\" he said. \n\"On Sunday, winds will continue to strengthen. If the forecast eventuates we're likely to see catastrophic fire danger develop in some areas, including the Hunter.\" \nMs Duma said the heatwave was building up in NSW after parts of Australia's south and east sweltered through 40-degree-plus temperatures yesterday, \n\"We had a stationary mid-level ridge over central Australia which is causing this build up of heat over the last month, this weekend we have an approaching front which will drag that hot air down from central Australia across New South Wales over the next few days.\" External Link: Interactive animation shows temperatures around Australia over the past week Power supply at record demand \nEnergy and Utilities Minister Don Harwin said the state was bracing for record power demand, with the peak expected between about 4:30pm and 6:30pm. \nHe called on the public to help reduce the load on electricity demand. \n\"Where you can, please do your best to save energy â€” turn up your air con to 26 degrees, adjust fridge temperatures, switch off unused electrical appliances and turn off lights where it's safe to do so,\" he said. \nThe Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) issued a market notice warning generators in NSW of a shortfall in electricity from 5:30pm. Sydney to sizzle over weekend \nMs Duma said Sydney and in particular western Sydney would see very hot conditions over the weekend. Heatwaves kill far more people than other natural disasters. ABC Emergency has a checklist of things you can do to be ready. \n\"We are expecting temperatures ranging from 38 to 45 degrees Celsius over the next couple of days,\" she said. \n\"Sydney City itself at Observatory Hill will be a little bit cooler under the influence of a late sea breeze Friday and Saturday. \n\"Western Sydney will remain very hot with temperatures of 44 and 45 degrees expected on Friday and Saturday and continuing into Sunday we are expecting a top of 41 degrees.\" \nThe town of Hay in the state's western Riverina region is expected to see highs of 47C on Friday and 46C on Saturday. \nThe NSW RFS warned residents living in fire-prone areas to prepare now in case of an emergency. \nCommissioner Fitzsimmons said conditions would be reviewed regularly. \n\"Firefighters from the NSW RFS, Fire & Rescue NSW, National Parks & Wildlife Service and Forestry Corporation of NSW are well prepared,\" he said. \n\"While they are very well trained, skilled and dedicated, we also need the community to be prepared.\" Heat stress, dehydration a real risk, health authorities say \nNSW Health has urged people to stay out of the heat as much as possible and ensure they stay well hydrated, especially through the hottest parts of the day. \n\"Drink plenty of fluids, that doesn't involve alcohol or caffeine. Water is best,\" the department's Ben Scully said. \n\"If you have air-conditioning it's great to use it otherwise keep your house cool by drawing the blinds and shutting the windows.\" \nDr Scully said heat stress was not the only condition attributed to heatwaves, with people also presenting with \"heart attacks and mental health-related issues\". \nHe also flagged that young children and the elderly were not the only ones vulnerable on days of extreme temperature. \n\"What we have been seeing over the past few weeks is that everyone is at risk and even young, otherwise healthy males have been coming at higher rates to emergency departments,\" Dr Scully said. \n\"So the message there really is that everyone is at risk of heatwaves and everyone has to take the advice.\" More on the heatwave:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:12:19.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
