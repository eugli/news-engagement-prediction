Enlarge Image \nApple isn't an activist, but is actively opposed to the immigration order. Stephen Lam, Getty Images \nDonald Trump has, in the past, called for a boycott on Apple products . \nThis was after Cupertino had refused an FBI request to hack a phone issued to one of the terrorists involved in the 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. \nI wonder, though, whether the president might have itchy Twitter fingers after Apple's CEO made a strong statement on Wednesday against Trump's order temporarily banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nSpeaking at Scotland's University of Glasgow -- where he was receiving an honorary degree -- Cook made his opposition to the order clear. \nAs reported by the university's own Twitter feed , he said: \"If we stand and say nothing we become a part of it, our company thrives on diversity.\" \nCook appears to believe that this is a moral, as well as a political issue, just as he does with respect to privacy . He insisted, though, that Apple isn't a political company. \n\"I don't believe Apple is an activist and I don't view myself as an activist,\" he said, answering a question from the audience . \"A lot of people hear that word and think about sort of a professional activist.\" He suggested that Apple carefully picks the issues it addresses loudly.
