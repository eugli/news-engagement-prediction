(Photo: Paul Morigi, AP Images for Human Rights Campaign) \nAmid other controversies stemming from the White House, rumors of President Trump’s plans for an anti-LGBTQ executive order surfaced Monday. \nMany in the LGBTQ community and rights advocates braced themselves. Now, each morning we wake up and ask \"What next?\" Answer: We keep going ❤ https://t.co/RC5mY6gBwR #LGBTEO \n— Chelsea Manning (@xychelsea) January 31, 2017 \nAnd then today the White House issued a statement expressing the president’s support of the LGBTQ community: \n“The President is proud to have been the first ever GOP nominee to mention the LGBTQ community in his nomination acceptance speech, pledging then to protect the community from violence and oppression. The executive order signed in 2014, which protects employees from anti-LGBTQ workplace discrimination while working for federal contractors, will remain intact at the direction of President Donald J. Trump.” And America now has its first openly pro-gay Republican president – pic.twitter.com/y9v6bIzRtW \n— Paul Singer (@singernews) January 31, 2017 \nPoliticians, celebrities, and many others along both sides of the debate took to Twitter to react. \nSome remain quite skeptical about the president’s motives and commitment. Thankfully for LGBTQ and those of us who support their equal rights, President Trump is giving signs of sanity today. But it's still early. pic.twitter.com/x9vtWlli3e \n— Ana Navarro (@ananavarro) January 31, 2017 If you're writing that Trump decided not to pursue a sweeping anti- #LGBTQ executive order, you have been played. Don't get played. \n— Rob Flaherty (@Rob_Flaherty) January 31, 2017 \nSeveral pointed to the others in the Trump Administration as potential threats to the LGBTQ agenda namely, Vice President Mike Pence. Trump is so pro -LGBTQ that he promises to protect them from his own Vice President. \n— John Fugelsang (@JohnFugelsang) January 31, 2017 Trump has an anti-gay vice president & an anti-gay attorney general, but he wants credit just for not overturning 1 of Obama's LGBTQ orders. pic.twitter.com/mpKt88MZzd \n— Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) January 31, 2017 \nOthers, including the Human Rights Campaign, spoke out sharply against the very idea of such an executive action. The HRC held a press conference Tuesday discussing the repercussions of possible LGBTQ discrimination at the federal level. Make no mistake: If faced w/ @realDonaldTrump 's rumored \"License to Discriminate\" EO, @HRC will fight tooth & nail to defend our community.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:44:02.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
