What Is a Mole and Why Are Moles Used? \nA mole is simply a unit of measurement. Units are invented when existing units are inadequate. Chemical reactions often take place at levels where using grams wouldn't make sense, yet using absolute numbers of atoms/molecules/ions would be confusing, too. \nLike all units, a mole has to be based on something reproducible. A mole is the quantity of anything that has the same number of particles found in 12.000 grams of carbon-12. That number of particles is Avogadro's Number , which is roughly 6.02x10 23 . A mole of carbon atoms is 6.02x10 23 carbon atoms. A mole of chemistry teachers is 6.02x10 23 chemistry teachers. It's a lot easier to write the word 'mole' than to write '6.02x10 23 ' anytime you want to refer to a large number of things! Basically, that's why this particular unit was invented. \nWhy don't we simply stick with units like grams (and nanograms and kilograms, etc.)? The answer is that moles give us a consistent method to convert between atoms/molecules and grams. \ncontinue reading below our video 10 Facts About the Titanic That You Don't Know It's simply a convenient unit to use when performing calculations. Okay... you may not find it too convenient when you are first learning how to use it, but once you become familiar with it, a mole will be as normal a unit as, say, a dozen or a byte. Converting Moles To Grams \nOne of the most common chemistry calculations is converting moles of a substance into grams. When you balance equations, you'll use the mole ratio between reactants and reagents. To do this conversion, all you need is a periodic table or another list of atomic masses. \nExample: How many grams of carbon dioxide is 0.2 moles of CO 2 ? \nLook up the atomic masses of carbon and oxygen. This is the number of grams per one mole of atoms. \nCarbon (C) has 12.01 grams per mole.Oxygen (O) has 16.00 grams per mole. \nOne molecule of carbon dioxide contains 1 carbon atom and 2 oxygen atoms, so: \nnumber of grams per mole CO 2 = 12.01 + [2 x 16.00]number of grams per mole CO 2 = 12.01 + 32.00number of grams per mole CO 2 = 44.01 gram/mole \nSimply multiply this number of grams per mole times the number of moles you have in order to get the final answer: \ngrams in 0.2 moles of CO 2 = 0.2 moles x 44.01 grams/molegrams in 0.2 moles of CO 2 = 8.80 grams \nIt's good practice to make certain units cancel out to give you the one you need. In this case, the moles canceled out of the calculation, leaving you with grams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:41:30.353+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
