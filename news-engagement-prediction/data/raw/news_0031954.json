Manly Campagin launched to save midwife-led maternity services when new hospital opens Julie Cross, 11, 2017 12:00am A CAMPAIGN has been launched to retain a midwife-led maternity unit at Mona Vale after the new hospital opens in Frenchs Forest.\nHealth bosses have previously said Mona Vale Hospital will become a rehabilitation unit when Northern Beaches Hospital is finished in late 2018.\nmedia_camera Mona Vale Hospital.\nBut now a group of independent and public midwives, doulas, experts and mothers wants the Mona Vale service to remain amid fears the new hospital will not offer the same sort of midwifery and continuity of service now available.\nOne campaign member, Australian College of Midwives president Caroline Homer, said it was proved that having the same midwife look after the woman through pregnancy, birth and after the birth had a positive emotional and physical impact on mum and baby.\n“Northern beaches women who don’t have access to midwifery continuity of care will be disadvantaged,” Professor Homer said.\nMother of four Rebekah Chandler said she moved to North Avalon recently from the north shore but had all four children through midwife-led maternity care.\n“For healthy, low-risk mums like me it was perfect,” said Mrs Chandler, who plans to have more children and, if she can, she will go under the care of a midwife at Mona Vale.\n“It’s proven midwife-led care is beneficial in so many ways, such as reducing the chances of post-natal depression,” she said.\nmedia_camera An artists impression of the Northern Beaches Hospital.\n“We live in Sydney, we expect to have choice.”\nThe other concern about the loss of the maternity unit at Mona Vale Hospital is that the drive to the new Northern Beaches Hospital would be too far for women living north of Collaroy.\n“If you tap the drive time in Google it’s 40 minutes from Palm Beach and Avalon to Frenchs Forest,” said mum-of-two and doula Helena Mooney, 43, of Balgowlah,\nShe said she believed passionately in childbirth choice for women.\n“In rush hour it would take much longer and it only takes a crash on the Wakehurst Parkway or flooding and it will be impossible to get there,” she said.\nThe Northern Beaches Hospital website states women will have access to the newest maternity service in NSW, with support throughout the antenatal, delivery and post-natal period of their pregnancy.\nmedia_camera Brad Hazzard MP. It will offer midwifery and obstetrician-led care, water birth facilities, 40 beds, 10 birthing suites and 12 special-care nursery cots.\nHealth Minister and Wakehurst MP Brad Hazzard while he understood the Northern Beaches Hospital would offer midwife continuity of care it was important that women had choice.\n“There’s nothing more precious and personal than giving birth to your child,” he said.\n“For that reason there has to be options for mums and their partners to determine where and how they want that to occur.”\nMr Hazzard said he would encourage mothers and midwives to submit expressions of interest.\nThe women who have formed Friends Of Northern Beaches Maternity Services are calling for people to sign their petition change.org/p/help-save-midwifery-continuity-of-care-on-our-northern-beaches? source_location=minibar and write to Mr Hazzard and Pittwater MP Rob Stokes.", "external_links": ["http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2F80adf70785b6b7d9e08091dd77504d60", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7afa9e7c2e6005b8e7a942c436e17fab?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/80cea766cfce29e7cc33209274c9d7af?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/80adf70785b6b7d9e08091dd77504d60?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/80adf70785b6b7d9e08091dd77504d60?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storyheader/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2F80adf70785b6b7d9e08091dd77504d60&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2F80adf70785b6b7d9e08091dd77504d60", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Fears%20midwife%20services%20will%20be%20scrapped&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fnews-story%2F80adf70785b6b7d9e08091dd77504d60", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1c5eca95b120281be31571d4deae4447?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/67448e64eaf8d31cd6b3607c58a5abac?width=1024", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/80adf70785b6b7d9e08091dd77504d60?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storymeta/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/manly-daily", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-10T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T07:24:44.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
