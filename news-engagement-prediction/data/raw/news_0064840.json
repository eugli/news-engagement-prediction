It might just be that there’s way more than you think. \nWhen one Twitter user discovered someone’s phone had been left behind in a bathroom, she attempted to find out who the phone belonged to in order to get it back to them. \nAnd, surprisingly, it was way easier than she thought it’d be. \nThere was no need to hack into the phone, to continuously guess the phone’s passcode or to emergency call someone – all there was to be done was to pull up Siri, and go from there. @afronomics_ asked Siri: ‘What’s my name?’– and after that, everything else was simple I asked siri what's my name. it pulled up her info. cool. I asked siri who do I call most. pulled up her recent calls. cool. \n— uninterested hō (@afronomics_) February 20, 2017 \nLuckily, the girl came to retrieve her phone from the bathroom before @afronomics could take it elsewhere to search for the girl I was about to call the most recent person but they called me first. I answer. the girl comes right back to get her phone. hooray. all good. \n— uninterested hō (@afronomics_) February 20, 2017 \nBut that didn’t stop her from thinking about just how easy it was to find out the phone owner’s name and address – and even where her car was parked but I realized when I pulled up her notifs & asked siri questions. I found her first & last name, where she lives, &where her car's parked. \n— uninterested hō (@afronomics_) February 20, 2017 For the record, with the most recent iOS update, we’ve tried it and it will only dish out addresses and more than one recent call if you are signed in with either fingerprint sensor or passcode it was that easy. all from a locked phone. I could've got directions to her car and her home. that shit scared me. \n— uninterested hō (@afronomics_) February 20, 2017 But she brings up a valid point – it is rather scary that so much important information can be discovered by anyone with a touch of a button. You never know who may pick up your phone should it be accidentally left somewhere idk if it's just me, but it's scary to know that anyone can find this info about me all from me leaving my phone in the bathroom for 5mins \n— uninterested hō (@afronomics_) February 20, 2017 After letting the girl know just how easy it was to find all of her details, she was pretty upset, too. And so the Twitter user helped her to change her settings so that details such as her home address and where her car is parked won’t show in the future when the phone is locked I told the girl. she was shook. then I changed her settings for her so that couldn't happen. \n— uninterested hō (@afronomics_) February 20, 2017 \nOne thing she didn’t notice is that you can compose and send an email just using Siri with the phone locked. \nIf you’re fearing the same thing happening to you – stop panicking, we’ve got your back. \nAll you need to do is go to ‘Settings’ on your iPhone, select ‘Touch ID & Passcode’ and under ‘Allow access when locked’ switch off Siri, today’s view and notifications view. \nThis will ensure that should anyone find your phone has been misplaced in the future, they will only be able to access the ‘Emergency call’ section of the phone.
