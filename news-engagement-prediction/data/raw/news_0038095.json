Man was in Baltimore Wednesday, but declined to name the developer or the location for the possible lagoon. But he said a decision could be forthcoming in the next six months. \"It would be used for all the wonderful activities in the summer,\" Man said, of the local lagoon's capacity for kayaking, paddle boarding and even sailing. \"The developer feels like itâ€™s going to be a key element for their development.\" Crystal Lagoons is planning a landmark-like lagoon for the Wynn resort in Las Vegas, Man said. That one will stretch 38 acres and is to be located on portion of what is now a golf course near the hotel complex. Man said the Baltimore lagoon could have a winter option of a possible skating rink. The developer, he said, is considering selling $25 day passes to the general public and even a seasonal \"beach pass\" for summer-long usage. \"It's all about enjoyment of the beach life,\" he said.
