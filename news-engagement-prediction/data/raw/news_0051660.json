Get what you need today in this early-morning email. The complaint follows another letter from July in which the committee noted the police department’s demographics do not match those of the increasingly diverse city, which has been a majority-minority city since 2011.\nWhite officers constitute about 65 percent of the department and more than four-fifths of supervisory officers.\nA spokeswoman for the department said the command staff is its most diverse ever and that the department has just announced the hiring of a diversity officer.\nAdvertisement\n“The department continues to strive to match the diversity of the community it serves and we always encourage eligible applicants from that community to join the BPD,” Police Officer Rachel McGuire said in a statement.\nStephanie Ebbert can be reached at Stephanie.Ebbert@globe.com .
