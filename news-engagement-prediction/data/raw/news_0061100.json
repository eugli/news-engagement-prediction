MARK TAYLOR FAIRFAX NZ \nSchool bus driver David White suggests speed cameras and signs alerting drivers to the cameras should adorn every school bus. \n\"I've seen it so many times. \n\"No one talks about the mother, father, grandmother being on the other side of the road.\" \nOn Tuesday, a six-year-old boy was hit while crossing the road to greet his nan and brother after getting off his school bus near Te Aroha. FAIRFAX NZ \nMore needs ot be done to keep children safe as they get off school buses, say bus drivers. \nIt nearly turned to tragedy when he was was run over by an SUV towing a boat and trailer on First Avenue North, Waihou, in the Eastern Waikato. He was flown to Waikato Hospital in a serious condition. Ad Feedback \nThe boy's grandmother and brother were waiting for him to cross the road near the family's home. The pair witnessed the event. \nAdams says children are told not to run across the other side of the road, but that always goes out of their heads when they're excited to see a parent after the schoolday. \n\"It's easy enough to sort out.\" \nAdams used to explain to the caregivers why they should stand on the same side of the road as the bus exit. \n\"Every single one of them I told got it and stood on the same side of the road.\" \nHe thinks it should be a universal message. \nIt does not cost money - it just takes common sense, Adams says. \nIt was personal to Adams, who ran over a child who had run in front of his bus. \n\"He saw mum and ran out in front of the bus. I was exonerated, no one was to blame.\" \nAnother school bus driver, David White, agrees that there needs to be an emphasis on parents greeting their children on the same side of the road as the bus stops. \n\"You would not believe the amount of parents that stay on the other side of the road,\" White says. \nIt would be the simplest solution, he says. \nAnother part of the problem was that drivers simply did not slow down around school buses, despite its being law to slow down to 20kmh when passing, White says. \n\"If you get them to slow down to 40kmh, then you are winning.\" \nWhite suggests speed cameras and signs alerting drivers to the cameras should adorn every school bus. \n\"You know what drivers are like when they see a speed camera or a sign. \n\"That would slow the buggers up.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:00:59.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
