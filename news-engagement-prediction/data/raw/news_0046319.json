With a 69.6 passer rating when thrown his way, Bradberry quickly became the Panthers’ top cornerback this season. \n“Panthers CB James Bradberry emerged as a viable replacement for the departed CB Josh Norman in the Carolina secondary. Bradberry allowed only a 69.6 passer rating in coverage, which was the 12th best mark among all #1 cornerbacks in the league this season.” Related: 2017 NFL mock draft: Panthers upgrade their running game \nMany folks still wonder if letting Josh Norman go was the correct move. While we pointed it out during the season, the final verdict on Bradberry’s rookie season is a positive one. With the statistics to back it up, Bradberry had a monumental season and sparked the turnaround in Carolina’s defense as the season wore on. \nDespite missing three games due to injury, Bradberry started all 13 games he was available for. He also accounted for 59 tackles, 10 passes defended and two interceptions for 21 yards. \nIt’s a promising start to what is hopefully a very impressive career for Bradberry. If he can keep it up, the Panthers should be able to build their secondary around him and better compete with the pass-happy teams within the NFL and NFC South.
