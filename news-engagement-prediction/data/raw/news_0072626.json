And it's possible the one earlier in the evening was an even bigger disaster. \nThe Oscars' popular 'In Memoriam' segment accidentally included a photo of someone still alive. \nCostume designer Janet Patterson, who was nominated for her work on period films like The Piano passed away in October. But the tribute used a picture of producer Jan Chapman. Oh dear. The #Oscars put up what I think is a photo of Jan Chapman, instead of Janet Patterson, for the In Memoriam segment. pic.twitter.com/VbnO7u3HoS — Rhett Bartlett (@dialmformovies) February 27, 2017 Chapman and Patterson worked together on The Piano, and a Getty Image search for Patterson pulls up a picture of Chapman. \nChapman told Variety she was disappointed the Academy used her picture. “I was devastated by the use of my image in place of my great friend and long-time collaborator Janet Patterson. I had urged her agency to check any photograph which might be used and understand that they were told that the Academy had it covered. Janet was a great beauty and four-time Oscar nominee and it is very disappointing that the error was not picked up. I am alive and well and an active producer.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T15:52:46.162+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
