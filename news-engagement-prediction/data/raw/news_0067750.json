And indeed, security researchers have already found potentially fatal vulnerabilities in these devices. \nSecurity expert Billy Rios, for example, discovered that drug pumps manufactured by Hospira contain security flaws that hackers could exploit to give patients a deadly overdose . \nHospira notes that there have been no reported incidents of such hackings, and that hospital firewalls are the first line of defense to its devices. The company is working with its customers to address the vulnerabilities.

Hackers know this too, since half (!) of the home baby monitors tested late last year by security firm Rapid7 were revealed to have significant security vulnerabilities that allow remote access by total strangers. \nIn one known incident , parents in Houston, Texas discovered that a hacker from Europe had accessed their Foscam Baby Monitor, and was using its two-way communications feature to shout insults at their 2-year-old daughter.

They then demonstrated the hack for a Wired reporter by disabling his vehicle (with his permission) as he drove it down a highway Interstate. \nCar maker Chrysler has since provided a patch to the 471,000 vulnerable vehicles on the road.

But that hasn't stopped some white hats from figuring out a way to break the technology. \nSecurity researcher Jonathan Petit, for example, was able to scramble the light detection and ranging (LIDAR) system on Google's self-driving car with little more than a $60 laser pointer setup.

Making matters even worse, security researcher Matt Jakubowski discovered a different vulnerability in the interactive toy that could give hackers the ability to track down the address of her owner. \nMattel and ToyTalk, the company behind the doll's software, have worked to patch these flaws. ToyTalk has also set up a bug bounty program to better secure the doll moving forward. \nThat's great news, of course. Still, we continue to question the wisdom of toys that upload the private conversations of children to a corporate cloud.

As it turns out, the same goes for televisions in the United States too. \nSamsung got into hot water with the public after it was revealed that the mics built in to its smart TVs were continuously recording and transmitting data to the company. Samsung's privacy policy warns that personal and other sensitive information may be picked up by the mic and transferred to third parties. \nConcerns over what Samsung would do with that data were somewhat overblown . The real worry here is what would happen if hackers illegally gained access to these features to spy on your family.

Because these systems did not require a username and password, hackers could remotely access their homes too, following a quick Google search.

Unfortunately, a recent analysis of the device by network security firm Pen Test Partners reveals that hackers could easily exploit a design flaw in Ring to steal your home Wi-Fi key, which was being stored by the device in an unencrypted form. \nRing has since patched the vulnerability via firmware update.

From there, a criminal could mount an attack on your home network -- or simply use data from the Nest to learn when you're home and when you're not. \nJin told Forbes in 2015 that a fix is impossible due to the way the hardware is built. Thankfully, this particular exploit requires a USB connection, so the hacker -- or an accomplice -- would first need physical access to your home before he or she could gain unfettered digital access.

Unfortunately, these Internet-connected cameras can double as a hacker's spycam when afflicted with the right malware. \nBecause many of these cameras come with default passwords, they're exceedingly easy to compromise. In fact, one criminal created a website featuring 11,000 live camera feeds , stolen from homes across the United States. \nAnd it's not just hackers who are using webcams to spy on people. A civil suit was filed against a school district in Pennsylvania after administrators used cameras on school-issued laptops to spy on kids and their families inside their homes without their knowledge. (The school paid $610,000 to settle the case .) \nDon't be a victim: Always change the default passwords of your IoT devices. You might also want to cover up your webcam when it's not in use .
