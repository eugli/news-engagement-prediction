Those closest to Romo on the Cowboys arenât ready to discuss the future of the Dallas quarterback, probably because they know the likely final answer. After 156 games, 34,183 yards passing and 248 touchdowns, Romoâs career in Dallas appears over after he lost the job he held for 10 years to rookie sensation Dak Prescott following a preseason back injury. The question is, whatâs next.

What's being said about Tony Romo: If he should stay with Cowboys, trade destinations and more \n\"I don't think that the [Dallas] organization is going to allow Tony Romo to go to a team in the NFC.\" Johnston told Newy Scruggs on his NBC Sports Radio show Wednesday. \"That would be a roadblock to the Cowboys getting to the Super Bowl.\" \n\"It would be fine to meet Tony Romo in the Super Bowl, but you don't really want to meet Tony Romo in the championship game.\" \nAll that said, Johnston thinks the best fit for Romo is in Houston. \n\"It's in the AFC, keeps him out of conference,\" Johnston, an NFL broadcaster for Fox, said. \"It has the No. 1 defense in the NFL [for the] regular season without JJ Watt, so just imagine how much better they'll be next season with JJ Watt. They've got a 1,000-yard rusher, they've got skill players on the outside, they've got a good offensive line, it appears that they're a quarterback away from taking that next step as a team.\" \nHouston even makes the best case for Romo from an off-the-field standpoint, Johnston pointed out. \n\"I think you also have to look at what's going on in Tony's personal life. I think he's built one of those forever houses in the Dallas area,\" he said. \"He's got a young family. You don't want to be too far away, you like to be able to go back and forth. You don't want to uproot your entire family at this stage.\" \nJohnston then talked through a few other options for Romo. \nJacksonville? \n\"I thought Jacksonville would be an interesting fit for Tony also. A young, up-and-coming defense, good skill players on the outside again, good running game. Is Blake Bortles the guy? Would Blake Bortles benefit from having Tony Romo around to study and learn from to take that next step? But I think that's a little bit too far away.\" What will the Cowboys do with Tony Romo? Our experts predict his fate \nKansas City? \n\"Is it time for Kansas City to move away from Alex Smith? They've had the opportunity for the last couple years and haven't been able to get past the divisional round. And it's also close to Dallas, a short flight back to Dallas. They've got a great defense. Does Tony Romo appeal to the Kansas City Chiefs? Would Andy Reid be willing to part ways with Alex Smith and move in another direction?\" \nArizona? \n\"Arizona is one of those teams where [Romo would fit in] if Carson Palmer decides this is it and steps away. [The Cardinals have] a lot of pieces in place, one year removed from the NFC championship game.\" This Topic is Missing Your Voice.
