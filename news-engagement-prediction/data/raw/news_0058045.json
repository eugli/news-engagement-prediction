My jaw was numb. I felt clammy. I was hot. I was cold. I was nauseated. \nTara’s husband took her straight to the hospital where doctors found nothing wrong, but the next morning, it happened again. Then a third and final time that afternoon. In the emergency room, Tara remembers these words: “You’re having a massive heart attack.” \n“That one was tough because you’re in a position where you’re pretty much helpless.” \nAnd at one point, doctors were as well. Tara remembers slipping away. Her doctors told her she died on the table. Tara Robinson (credit: Tara Robinson) \n“She called my name three times. I could hear her and I ran into this bright wall and I hit it and I could feel the air come back into my body and I shifted on the table,” she said. \nThree heat attacks in one week. She died and came back. Incredibly lucky for Tara, a life-saving lesson for the rest of us to be your own best advocate. \nTara ended up having a stent put in her main artery, but now that stent has closed up. She’s among those whose heart has actually done a natural bypass by growing new blood vessels around the new blockage. \nFor more information on heart attack symptoms, click here .
