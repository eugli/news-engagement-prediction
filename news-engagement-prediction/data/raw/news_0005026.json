If only to get rid of drugs.”\nPolice have reported killing 2,555 people in the drug war, while nearly 4,000 others have died in unexplained circumstances, according to official figures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:15:06.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
