But the two groups have found common ground in uniting against plans to carry out exploratory oil drilling in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and the Green Belt. Their structure, which they refer to as a ‘cathedral’, is made from wooden pallets and has a 25ft central tower. Among the signs pinned to it is one that declares: ‘Nature is not a financial asset’. The controversial project was originally rejected by Surrey County Council after widespread opposition from locals and conservation groups. Middle class residents of the hamlet Coldharbour, in Surrey, have joined forces with eco-warriors to campaign against drilling for oil in the Area of Natural Outstanding Beauty But Europa Oil and Gas was granted permission in 2015 after a four-year planning battle including two public inquiries. The scheme involves cutting down around a hectare of woodland and erecting a temporary derrick up to 100ft high in Bury Hill Wood near the popular beauty spot of Leith Hill – close to part of the route of the Tour of Britain race. Using a ‘deviated well’, drillers hope to strike ‘black gold’ around a mile away, some 1,000m below the car park of the Plough Inn pub in Coldharbour. Europa, which has three oil fields in the East Midlands, plans to start work this year despite technical reports suggesting there is only a one in three chance of finding oil. The land protectors' roadside camp near the site of Europa Oils proposed exploration drilling site in Bury Hill Wood near Dorking, Surrey The protest camp sprang up in October last year, with around a dozen activists staying there in a tepee, caravans and an old ambulance. They were quickly welcomed by locals, who set up a cooking rota and brought them books to read, including a Miller’s antiques guide. Passing Mercedes and BMW cars toot their horns in response to a sign put up by the protesters’ asking motorists to show their support as they sit under a tarpaulin.The inhabitants call themselves ‘land protectors’. One, a 49-year-old man who is a veteran of other protest sites linked to anarchists, said: ‘We’re not seen as the great unwashed here like we usually are. There’s a lot of love and amazing, beautiful people.’ The protesters have been told to leave by Europa and warned they could face jail for contempt of court – but are determined to stay put. By contrast, Coldharbour residents Patrick Nolan, 40, and his 39-year-old wife Charlotte, both actuaries, set up an action group funded by more than £100,000 in donations. Mr Nolan said: ‘People realise they may have more in common with us than apart.’ The small village of Coldharbour near there site of Bury Hill Wood, Dorking, Surrey, is near the Leith Hill beauty spot in the Surrey Hills area of outstanding natural beauty and green belt The fight is also backed by one of the hamlet’s celebrity residents – actress and wildlife campaigner Virginia McKenna. The 85-year-old Born Free star spoke of a ‘profound desire to protect what’s left of the natural environment’. John Hopper, 41, landlord of the Plough Inn, who has given some camp dwellers occasional shift work as kitchen porters, said: ‘This is an AONB – drilling here makes a mockery of such status.’ Andy Smith, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘It is understandable that people resort to this form of activism when they feel that they have run out of other options.’ If oil is present, Europa says there could be up to 11 million barrels, making it one of the largest on-shore oil fields in the UK. Company boss Hugh Mackay said the firm would try to keep disturbance to a minimum. He pointed out that more than 250 wells have been drilled in the Weald Basin of south-east England since the 1930s ‘without environmental incident’.
