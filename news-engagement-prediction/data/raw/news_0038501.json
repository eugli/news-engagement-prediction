Bill Gronvold Orlando Sentinel Correspondent \nLake Highland Prep, the area’s top-rated girls basketball team, will not be making a third straight trip to Lakeland for a final four appearance. The Highlanders lost 52-49 at home to district rival and Sentinel Super Six No. 5 Jones in a Class 5A region semifinal on Tuesday night. \nJunior wing Chardell Jones had a team-high 19 points to go with 10 rebounds and six assists for Jones (21-7). Sophomore guard Jamiya Turner added 12 points. Virtually all of those points were scored in the paint. \nThe Tigers held Lake Highland senior standout Tyra Cox to just seven of her game-high 22 points in the first half. \n“We wanted to go to our 1-2-2 zone and be sure to stop (Tyra) Cox,” said Jones coach Robert Moultrie. “She hurt us with free throws in the district championship game (won by LHP 42-33). We wanted to stop their shooters tonight.” \nJones’ win came in the rubber match of this season’s three-game series. The Tigers beat the Highlanders in overtime at home in the regular season, but lost to Lake Highland in the district championship game. \nLake Highland (21-7) and Jones came into the game ranked third and fourth, respectively, in Class 5A by MaxPreps. \nLake Highland won consecutive Class 4A titles in the past two seasons. The Highlanders trailed 10-4 after one quarter but went ahead 19-17 lead late in the second. Jones came back to lead 20-19 at intermission. \n“Our team came out tight tonight,” said Lake Highland coach Al Honor. “I’ve never seen them like that.” \nJones led 38-29 after three quarters but Lake Highland rallied to tie the game at 47-all with three minutes remaining in regulation. A layup and a free throw by Jones and two more free throws by senior Jaiyanna Thomas sealed the victory for the Tigers, who will play at Lakeland McKeel Academy in the region final on Friday. \nFreshman forward Zamoria Cruz had nine points for the Highlanders. \nJones is now 2-2 in region semifinal play against the Highlands, all of those games played on LHP’s home court. \n“We knew that Jones was going to come at us with anything and everything,” Cox said after her final high school game. “I knew they were going to try to stop me from penetrating, so I had to look for my teammates to score in different ways. They did a good job of finding our weaknesses and trying to make us shoot the harder shots.” \nHonor, Lake Highland’s sixth-year coach, took the loss in stride. \n“I didn’t have anything on my calendar until after (February) the 25th,” he said good-naturedly. “I guess I’ll take my son (LHP junior Nick Honor) on some recruiting trips.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:07:25.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
