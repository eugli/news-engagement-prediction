(Jonathan Kozub/NHLI via Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   5:05 PM \nAlain Vigneault expected the Rangers were getting a fast, responsible wing who can improve the penalty kill when general manager Jeff Gorton inked Michael Grabner to a two-year, $3.3 million contract. Vigneault and associate coach Scott Arniel coached Grabner when all three were a part of the Canucks organization. \nWhat he didn’t know, what he or anyone else couldn’t possibly foresee was that Grabner would become the Rangers’ top goal-scorer and one of the NHL’s leading scorers in mid-February. \n“When I had him in Vancouver and we played him in a playoff series, he scared the defensemen with that speed,” Vigneault said. “I knew we were getting that, I didn’t know we were gonna get the consistent goal-scorer that we’ve got. But he’s got his swagger right now, he’s feeling good about himself, he’s working his butt off, and that’s real positive for him and our team.” \nVigneault did say he and his coaches were aware of the chances he had been creating for himself, the looks and breakaways as a result of tireless defensive work and elite speed that just weren’t going in. Grabner had 34 goals with the Islanders in 2010-11 and 20 the next season, but he totaled 29 goals over his last three seasons. \nHenrik Lundqvist shuts door on Ducks in Rangers' 4-1 win \nNow he has 26, which entering Saturday’s game against the Avalanche at the Garden was tied for fourth in the NHL. He led the league with 25 even-strength goals. His 2.11 goals per 60 minutes was also tops in the NHL. New York Daily News back pages of 2017 \nThis after he was tabbed for a fourth-line role on a Rangers group deep and skilled up front, beginning the season on a line with penalty-killing partner Jesper Fast. \n“When we made that decision, and give credit to (Gorton) and his scouting staff, Arnie and I knew him personally and were definitely pushing for him, but there’s a list of players there and they see the players a lot more than we do live and not emotional,” Vigneault said. “For us we’re behind the bench. I thought we were getting a guy that obviously could help us on the penalty killing. Theoretically when you make up your lines in the summer you say ‘This guy’s probably a fourth line. If somebody doesn’t do well he could step up.’” \nHe’s stepped up into a formidable trio with Kevin Hayes and J.T. Miller, and he’s sparked the Rangers with what Ryan McDonagh says is wise decision-making. \nMichael Grabner finds his swagger and leads Rangers in goals \n“He certainly has confidence right now, but he’s playing well within our structure,” McDonagh said. “He’s accountable in his defensive play and he’s trusted there because he’s good in that role. There’s certainly a lot of guys in this league that have speed and skill, but he’s a smart player too, understanding where there’s a situation when to utilize that, when to be creative and when to be patient.” Michael Grabner shoots the puck past Anaheim Ducks goalie John Gibson earlier this week. (Frank Franklin II/AP) \nGrabner drew comparisons to former Ranger Carl Hagelin, whom the Rangers traded to Anaheim at the 2015 draft, the signing seen as the Rangers attempting to replace the speed and penalty-killing prowess they lost when they had to deal Hagelin away amid a cap crunch. \nVigneault coached Hagelin for two seasons, and while he was willing to say Grabner and Hagelin were the two fastest players he had, he would not say who he thought was the speedier skater. \n“Jeez, that’s a tough one. That’d be a toss-up,” Vigneault said. “Those two would be 1A, 1B.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:07:40.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
