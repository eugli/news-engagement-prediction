This exquisite, beautifully shot meditation on love clouded by fear and doubt is the fourth feature by the Korean-American filmmaker So Yong Kim ( “Treeless Mountain” ), which she wrote with Bradley Rust Gray. Little is resolved, and it will leave you contemplating the mysteries of relationships. Sarah, who has a 3-year-old daughter, Jessie, communicates with her mostly absent husband, Dean (Cary Joji Fukunaga), via Skype. Scenes of Sarah and Jessie gently roughhousing capture the blissful mother-daughter bond with a poignant intensity, wrapping the viewer in the blanket of their intimacy.

Watch in Times Video » embed The film begins with the two friends reuniting, and they soon embark with Jessie on a spontaneous road trip that takes them to eastern Pennsylvania, where they visit a rodeo and an amusement park and play a game called “truth or drink.” Amid gales of tipsy laughter, they pour out their confessions of naughty misdeeds and in quieter moments murmur endearments and exchange kisses. Each seems to be waiting for the other to define their relationship and carry it to the next level, but it doesn’t happen. Three years pass, and Sarah drives to Tennessee to attend Mindy’s wedding to Leif (Ryan Eggold). Already there are signs Mindy is not fully committed to her fiancé, and is going through the motions for reasons that are never explained. And when Mindy’s bitter, hard-boiled mother (Rosanna Arquette) arrives, her gimlet eye zeros in on her daughter’s ambivalence and she bluntly asks her why she is going through with the wedding. From the moment Sarah appears, tugs of longing and desire after their lengthy separation are as palpable as ever. The two steal time to be alone together as the final preparations are being made for a wedding filled with raucous off-color humor. Ms. Keough ’s soft, shy performance is as compelling as her chilling portrayal of a high-end escort in the Starz series “The Girlfriend Experience,” but completely opposite in tone. It is matched in power by Ms. Malone’s frisky but wary Mindy in a movie devoid of overt sexual politics in which “the L word” (lesbian) is never spoken.
