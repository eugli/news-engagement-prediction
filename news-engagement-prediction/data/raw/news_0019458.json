Key points: Much of Victoria to experience mid-40s heat but cool change expected for Melbourne Adelaide to hit 42C again, Tarcoola in SA to reach 47C Students in SW Queensland kept indoors, heatwave to intensify in NSW towards weekend \nParts of Australia's south and east will swelter through 40-plus temperatures today as severe heatwave conditions continue to develop. \nThe Bureau of Meteorology says a severe heatwave is moving through the southern parts of South Australia and much of Victoria, while spreading further east into New South Wales' coastal regions and south-west Queensland. \nMildura and Swan Hill are expected to reach 44C today, prompting fire bans and heat health warnings for the Mallee and Wimmera regions. \nThere is also a total fire ban in the Central region and heat warnings for East Gippsland. \nIt will only be slightly cooler in Melbourne with a forecast maximum of 37C the Victorian capital's hottest day of the season so far. The Bureau of Meteorology maps areas that are expected to have unusually hot conditions over a period of four days. \nA cool change for Melbourne will arrive in the afternoon, but the weather bureau's Dr Chris Godfred says the hot air is expected to hang around the north of the state well into the weekend. \n\"Albury's expecting a top of 43C Friday and then 40C, 41C along the Murray River during Saturday,\" he said. \n\"The air mass is quite humid. It's going to limit the degree of cooling. Conditions as we try to sleep, especially Thursday night, [are] going to be quite stifling.\" \nFirefighters have spent the night monitoring hot spots after a grassfire at Diggers Rest, in Melbourne's north west. \nWhile the fire is under control, authorities have issued an advice message for residents in Diggers Rest and Calder Park to monitor conditions. \nFirefighters have also brought a bushfire under control overnight at Amphitheatre, near Lexton, in the state's west. \nThe heatwave in New South Wales is expected to reach severe and extreme levels towards the weekend. Parts of SA push towards 50C External Link: How to cope with a heatwave \nSouth Australia is in for a second hot and muggy day with the temperature in Adelaide expected to hit 42C again today, and Tarcoola in the state's north tipped to reach 47C. \nThe mercury in Adelaide hit 42.4C yesterday and senior forecaster Tom Boeck says inland areas will remain hot and sticky today. \nHe says the state will not see much relief from the heat until late on Saturday or early on Sunday. \n\"Certainly it will be feeling quite humid today with moisture still pushing down from the north,\" he said. \n\"Unfortunately the evap aircon like I have won't be working too well today, but hopefully in the overnight period they'll be functioning a bit better with the temperatures coming down a touch.\" \nSouth Australia's Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis wants answers from the Australian Energy Market Operator over forced power outages last night while the temperature hovered at 40 degrees . \nMore than 40,000 homes were without power for more than half an hour after SA Power Networks was instructed to begin load shedding because of a lack of available generation. Heatwaves kill far more people than other natural disasters. ABC Emergency has a checklist of things you can do to be ready. \nMr Koutsantonis says despite the extreme heat that had been forecast days ago, the national operator failed to turn on extra generation at Pelican Point. \n\"We knew that we were heading into a very, very high-demand evening [with] very, very hot winds and very, very hot conditions,\" he said. \n\"We should've had all of our available generation on and operating, and for whatever reason the market operator didn't turn on all that generation and we were left short for 27 minutes, and that's unacceptable.\" \nThe Australian Energy Market Operator has been contacted for comment. Queensland students kept indoors \nStudents at a school in south-west Queensland are having to spend lunchtime indoors as temperatures soar above 40C. \nSt Patrick's primary school in St George has implemented a \"hot weather policy\" where students stay in their air conditioned classrooms once the temperature hits 42C. ABC Emergency has sourced advice from official agencies on how to plan for a bushfire emergency, including preparing a survival kit and what to do before, during and after a disaster. \nPrincipal Brendan Redinger says keeping the students cool is crucial to their learning. \n\"If they're running around, you know, even in the shade, it's hot. So we have to be mindful of these students and help them out with their regulation of temperature,\" he said. \n\"So by looking after them and keeping them cool and calm in this situation we're getting the best out of them.\" \nTemperatures in St George are expected to reach 45C.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:04:53.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
