Not every late-night show could break down the complicated universe of multilevel marketing in a half hour . Or make a strong case for discontinuing the penny. Or explain net neutrality in language that everyone can actually understand. Really, most wouldn’t bother trying to mine such things for comedy—but that’s precisely what John Oliver has always done best on Last Week Tonight. The brilliance of Oliver’s comedy is how it exposes and breaks down even the most byzantine issues, making them digestible—even appealing—to viewers who otherwise might never have delved into the subject at hand. It’s a delicate formula: research blended with jokes, with an occasional dash of surprise. Sometimes, that last ingredient is Oliver’s favorite part. “I guess the happiest I get is when we do something really irredeemably stupid,” Oliver said at a press roundtable ahead of his show’s return to HBO for its fourth season Sunday night. For those who need their memories refreshed, he was referring to, say, the time the show created its own miniature Supreme Court—presided over by some very cute canine justices. Or the time Last Week Tonight made its own Spotlight parody to illustrate the challenges plaguing journalists. As Oliver put it, “Sometimes, one of the most fun things is just seeing a group of adults do a really silly, spectacular waste of HBO's resources.” But these little surprises do have a function beyond simple gimmickry. They’re precisely what fans of the show have come to love—the big, red bow tied around a well-constructed argument. The Spotlight parody, for example, added more to the argument than just Jason Sudeikis, Mahershala Ali, Rose Byrne, and Bobby Cannavale. It gave viewers who work outside the media a small taste of what Oliver was talking about—as silly as the idea of a newsroom full of journalists arguing about whether to run a story on Boston corruption or a “rat-cat” might be. The finished product, Oliver said, “felt like a really spectacular version of the thing that we had in our heads. Probably even bigger than the idea that we had in our heads. I guess that's when I'm so proud of our staff, is when we can do something that is beyond how I saw it. . . You think, ‘Holy shit, what happened to this idea? When did this get good?’” Thanks to its weekly format and the relatively long lead-times required to produce most of its long takes, Last Week Tonight avoided becoming quite as saturated with election coverage as its neighbors on other networks in 2016. Sure, there was that massively viral “Drumpf” video —but that didn’t land until March, when several other shows had already been covering the election consistently for months. In total, Oliver noted that only eight out of last season’s 22 episodes covered the election in any capacity during their long takes. Going into a Trump presidency, Oliver emphasized his eagerness to avoid his show getting mired in Trump pieces. “I think we're very anxious to not make it all Trump all the time, just both on a level of interest, and on a level of what the human soul can sustain,” he said. For the last month, he hand his team have been careful to work on stories that have “nothing to do” with Trump. “Even if someone asked, there's no real point in spending a month working on something that he said if we can’t work out what the consequences of that are going to be,” Oliver explained. “The longterm stories that we've been working on will be for later in the year. Those are the really complicated ones that we need a significant amount of runway [for].” Could this mean he’s got a few more surprises up his sleeve? Thankfully, fans won’t have to wait too long to find out. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T10:32:10.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
