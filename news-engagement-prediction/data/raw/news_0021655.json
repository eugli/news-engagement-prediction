Photo: Anna Kucera \n\"Based on the last 12 months of shenanigans about the SCA's future, we don't really have much faith in senior management at Sydney University to make that call,\" Iveson said. \nThe NTEU has expressed concerns that not taking in new students in 2017 could affect the financial viability of the art school and its reputation. \nThe university is also entangled in legal cases brought by art students that may take years to resolve. \nTim Heiderich is the first student to launch proceedings against the university in the NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal seeking a refund and compensation for breaches of contract and consumer laws. \nThandiwe Bethune, who will embark on the second year of a Bachelor of Visual Arts in 2017, said uncertainty about the future of the art school had affected her studies. \n\"It's super-stressful,\" she said. \"I don't remember the last time I just sat down and made art.\" \nShe added: \"The teachers are obviously terrified about losing their jobs. I think it's also hard for them to focus on class work.\" \nFellow art student Suzy Faiz expressed doubts about the proposed new site of the art school. \n\"There are currently no facilities there and very little room, so permanent studio spaces which are offered at Callan Park and are extremely important to making of work are unlikely to exist,\" she said. \n\"I imagine it will be a classroom-like situation where students are expected to make work at home. The student enrolments will surely have to be vastly reduced, as well as the teaching positions.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:22:41.701+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
