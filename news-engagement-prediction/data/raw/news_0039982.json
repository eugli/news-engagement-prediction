That’s a 30% jump from last year, and a 2.6-times increase from the second quarter of 2013, according to Pacific Crest. \nOn top of that, the number of companies spending $US10 million or more on Salesforce has grown 47% year-over-year, and 7.6-times since the second quarter of 2013, Pacific Crest notes. The company has signed at least four $US100 million-plus deals over the last four quarters alone. Pacific Crest \nAlthough there are a lot of different reasons for Salesforce’s success, Pacific Crest notes Block was a key factor. Block now runs Salesforce’s global sales, customer support, and consulting services organisations, and has played a major role in helping the company get into specific verticals, like finance, healthcare, and government sectors. It’s no surprise he holds three different titles at Salesforce (President, COO, and Vice Chairman). \nAnd Benioff is making sure Block gets financially rewarded as well. In addition to paying him roughly $US12 million in total compensation, Salesforce gave Block a watch worth $US41,000 last year , in recognition of his “leadership.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:01:09.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
