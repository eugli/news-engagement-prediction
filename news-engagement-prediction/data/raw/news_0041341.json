He wants Australia to halt some $30 million in aid to the Palestinian authority. \nAt about the time Mr Abbott was visiting Israel, his successor Malcolm Turnbull was in Sydney as the main speaker marking the 80th birthday of JewishCare. Mr Turnbull used his speech at JewishCare in December to reiterate Australia’s support of Israel.

We have been resolute in supporting Israel’s right to take the necessary steps to defend itself from terror.” \nA few days after Mr Turnbull’s December speech to JewishCare, Australian declined to match the diplomatic rebuke of Israel by the Obama administration over settlement expansion taking more land from Palestinians. \nHowever, in January, Australia expressed concern over a further eviction of Palestinians. \n“This is a significant expansion deep in the West Bank that does have the capacity to undermine the credibility of a two-state solution,” a source from Foreign Minister Julie Bishop’s office told the ABC. \nThis Thursday Mr Netanyahu will meet Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and shadow ministers. \nThe platform of the ALP, as voted on at the annual conference in 2015, calls for a two-state creation, and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten made that clear when he, too, had talks with Mr Netanyahu in Tel Aviv in December. \n“Labor has long supported a two-state solution. We support the right of both Palestinians and Israelis to live within secure borders,” Mr Shorten said recently. \n“I will make it clear to Mr Netanyahu that where settlement building is an obstacle to two-state solution, it should be stopped. Full stop.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will arrive in Australia tomorrow.
