More than a minute, actually (last September to be exact). And in a world as fast-paced as sneaker land, going quiet for a stretch time tends to make people forget about a particular shoe (also, a lot has happened in the world since then). If you almost forgot about the magic Drizzy and Jordan Brand were cooking up, it's time to get reacquainted: For the past year-plus, Drake's in-house label OVO has teamed up with Jordan Brand on stingray-adorned classic styles like the Air Jordan 10 and 12. Previously, white and black OVO Jordan 10s have hit the market, and as mentioned last September saw the release of the white OVO Jordan 12s. Today, unexpectedly, the fourth sneaker in the set was announced, dubbed the OVO x Air Jordan 12“Black.\" It was also announced that the sneaker will be released on February 13 via raffles. \nOf course raffles are a regular thing these days for any new highly-anticipated sneaker. This means that right now tickets for the Jordan 12s are available in Toronto, New York, and Los Angeles at OVO flagship stores. But if you aren't in one of those major cities, know that the OVO x Air Jordan 12 “Black” will also launch via the Nike SNKRS app at 11 a.m. ET on the official release date of February 18 as well as at octobersveryown.com . That doesn't mean they'll be easy to get by any means, but it does mean you don't have to wait in line just for a chance to get your hands on a pair. \nUnlike the white pair of OVO Jordan 12s, the black version has an even more streamlined look thanks to the lack of golf lace loops or insert. If you're a sneakerhead looking to flex on your peers that might make them less worth the effort, but to us, it makes them all the more stylish.
