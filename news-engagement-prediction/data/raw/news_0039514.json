The official scorer at University of Denver hockey games doesn’t enjoy spelling Jarid Lukosevicius, but the public-address announcer has no problem belting out the pronunciation: LUCO-savages.\n“Luco” has become a popular player for the No. 2-ranked Pioneers and their fans.\nThe sophomore forward is tied for second in DU goal-scoring (11) first in shots (109) and game-winning goals (six). Lucosevicius usually plays left wing on DU’s top line with freshman center Henrik Borgstrom and sophomore right winger Troy Terry.\nRelated Articles February 12, 2017 Denver Pioneers hockey is dominant, locally and nationally February 10, 2017 Denver Pioneers edge Colorado College, despite freshman goalie’s heroics “Fun-loving kid who brings a smile to his teammates’ faces regularly, and a player who has grown immensely on and off the ice,” DU coach Jim Montgomery said of Lukosevicius. “He’s become a glue guy — not only a nucleus in the lineup — but off the ice too. He holds his teammates accountable and he relishes his role on our team and loves being a Pioneer.”\nLukosevicius, whose Lithuanian-born grandparents migrated to Quebec, Canada, grew up in Squamish, British Columbia, and joined DU from the Powell River Kings of the British Columbia Hockey League (junior-A). He wasn’t highly recruited but knew he would sign with Denver shortly after he visited Minnesota State in Mankato, before the 2013-14 season.\nMinutes after Minnesota State dropped him off at the airport, Montgomery made him an offer he could not refuse.\n“He asked me if I would like to come here,” Lukosevicius said. “I pretty much said ‘yes’ right away. Colorado (Avalanche) is my favorite team and as soon as Monty asked me my heart kind of dropped. It was weird. As soon as they dropped me off, he phoned me. I didn’t say yes right then and there, but I knew”\nMontgomery learned about Lukosevicius the same weekend he was visiting Minnesota State. The coach leaned on his assistants at the time, Steve Miller and David Lassonde, and offered Lukosevicius a scholarship without meeting him.\n“I was on a recruiting trip and watching video in the hotel, killing time,” Montgomery said. “Luco made a couple plays and I thought he would fit in well with the way I like to play. I asked Killer (Miller) and Lassonde, and then called him right away.”\nLukosevicius continued to play junior A through the 2014-15 season before beginning college at age 20. As a freshman, he played in 34-of-41 games and had six goals and 10 points. It was a decent first season, but nothing extraordinary.\n“From the BCHL to college hockey practices, especially Monty’s practices, I wasn’t prepared right away,” Lukosevicius said. “Now, I’m prepared for every practice and that translates to games.”\nHis role is to shoot the puck — and attack it when he doesn’t control it. His 109 shots is more than double what he had last season (49) and his puck pursuit is relentless.\n“His work ethic on the forecheck and on the backcheck — he’s become a 200-foot hockey player,” Montgomery said. “Last year, there’s no way he would have been out with a one-goal lead in the last five minutes of the game. He’s out there all the time now.”\nFive facts about University of Denver hockey forward Jarid Lukosevicius — Known as “Luco” in DU hockey circles\n— Claim to fame: Being the roommate/linemate of Troy Terry, the U.S. World Junior hero from Highlands Ranch\n— Born in British Columbia, Canada, but grandparents are from Lithuania and they migrated to Quebec\n— Leads DU with 109 shots and six game-winning goals\n— His 21 points is more than double what he amassed as a freshman (10)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:10:06.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
