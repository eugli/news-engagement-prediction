We’ve set out in the mental health strategy how seriously we take it.”\nOn Monday, under pressure over the comments, Freeman said: “Having experienced myself traumatic anxiety as a child carer living with alcohol, I know all too well the pain anxiety and depression causes, which is why as a former health minister and policy adviser I am passionate about supporting mental health and disability, and hugely regret if my comment about the need to prioritise the most serious disabilities inadvertently caused any offence which was not intended.”\n\nSome Conservative backbenchers, including Heidi Allen, the South Cambridgeshire MP, are among those who have expressed concern about the tightening of the rules on personal independence payments (Pip), which also prevent those living with long-term conditions such as diabetes and monitoring themselves being classed alongside patients receiving kidney dialysis. \nThe rule changes, announced just days before the budget, have reminded some of George Osborne’s ill-fated attempt to claw back money from the disability benefits bill at last year’s budget, which prompted the resignation of Iain Duncan Smith . \nThe government hopes to push through the required shifts to disability rules through a “statutory instrument”, in the House of Commons. \nThe Liberal Democrats leader, Tim Farron, has tabled a motion seeking to block the changes by “praying against” them – a formal parliamentary manoeuvre that could force the government to offer a debate on the changes, if it gains enough support from MPs.\nAs chair of May’s policy board, Freeman is responsible for long-term thinking on issues including intergenerational fairness and NHS funding.\nFarron said: “The government is in real trouble with these Pip changes. While senior Conservatives make deeply crass and offensive remarks, many disabled people are worried about what the future will bring.\n“The Liberal Democrats have tabled a motion in the House of Lords to kill these regulations and have now done the same in the Commons. I am calling on Labour and Conservative backbenchers to sign this motion and help us block these deeply damaging cuts.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T15:39:54.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
