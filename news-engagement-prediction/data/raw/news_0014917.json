One lawyer waiting at New York's Kennedy Airport said visa and green-card holders from Iraq and Iran were encountering no problems as they arrived. \n\n\"It's business as usual,\" said Camille Mackler, of the New York Immigration Coalition. \n\nFariba Tajrostami, a 32-year-old painter from Iran, came through the gate at Kennedy with a huge smile and tears in her eyes as her brothers greeted her with joyful hugs. \"I'm very happy. I haven't seen my brothers for nine years,\" she said. \n\nTajrostami had tried to fly to the US from Turkey over a week ago but was turned away. \n\n\"I was crying and was so disappointed,\" she said. \"Everything I had in mind, what I was going to do, I was so disappointed about everything. I thought it was all over.\" \n\nTajrostami said she hopes to study art in the US and plans to join her husband in Dallas soon. He moved from Iran six months ago, has a green card and is working at a car dealership. \n\nSimilar scenes played out across the US two days after a federal judge in Seattle suspended the president's travel ban and just hours after a federal appeals court denied the Trump administration's request to set aside the ruling. \n\nThe US canceled the visas of up to 60,000 foreigners in the week after the ban on travel from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Libya and Yemen took effect, according to the State Department. Trump also suspended nearly all refugee admissions for 120 days and barred Syrian refugees indefinitely. \n\nThe order triggered protests and a multitude of legal challenges around the country and blocked numerous college students, researchers and others from entering the US. \n\nTrump, who said the goal was to keep terrorists from slipping into the country, lashed out against US District Judge James Robart for putting the ban on hold. He referred to Robart as a \"so-called judge\" and called the ruling \"ridiculous.\" \n\nOn Sunday, the president tweeted: \"Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\" \n\nAt JFK on Sunday evening, Abdullah Alghazali hugged and kissed his 13-year-old son, Ali Abdullah Alghazali, who he had not seen in six years. That wait was made even longer by Trump's executive order.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:11:00.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
