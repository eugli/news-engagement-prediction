I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide. #sisterlove \n— jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 22, 2017 \n“I am obviously disappointed in the [president’s] decision to send the transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide,” she tweeted Wednesday. \nEvancho, who was the runner-up on the fifth season of America’s Got Talent , has a transgender sister named Juliet, People reported in October 2015. \nJuliet grew up playing with Barbie dolls, putting on makeup and wearing dresses with her sister, she told the magazine. \nREAD MORE: Trump administrations craps Obama’s guidance on transgender bathrooms \nShe realized she was transgender when she was 13 years old. She came out to her family four years later, on her 17th birthday. \nSo Trump’s decision hit a personal note for Jackie, who called on the president to meet with her sister to talk about transgender rights. . @realDonaldTrump u gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration.

I never imagined that my government would be one of them,” Grimm said at a White House protest. \n“We will not be beaten down by this administration.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
