But there is one other thing that Bollywood inspires us with. It’s the amount of love these celebs have for their parents. They give us serious goals on how to be always close to our parents. Like how Tiger Shroff got his father Jackie on stage after his Filmfare Awards 2017 performance getting a huge round of applause in return. In a similar fashion, Abhishek Bachchan too often puts up stuff on his social media account which leaves us smitten! Say for example today when he shared a picture of him hugging Amitabh Bachchan so lovingly. If you are staying away from your parents, it will make you miss your father dearly. (Also read: 7 underrated performances of Abhishek Bachchan that tell us why we need to see him in more movies ) \nAbhishek’s face is not visible as he hugs AB sr from the back. The look on Mr. Bachchan’s face is priceless. It’s something that you see on your dad’s face when you suddenly show affection when he is least expecting it. We absolutely love, love this pic! But it’s the message that he wrote which might make you feel a sudden pang of longing for your dad. Check it out right here to know what we are saying. A post shared by Abhishek Bachchan (@bachchan)  23pm PST \nIsn’t it just adorable? Priyanka Chopra too shared an old pic of her parents yesterday celebrating their anniversary. She missed her father while writing so and you will feel her hurt. Parents are very special…they are the reasons we exist. They deserve all the love that we can pour on them and hence, we salute Abhishek and Priyanka for bringing us closer to them a little more than usual with their messages.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T19:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T15:22:28.881+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
