Mark Williams \nMark Williams, chief audiologist at The Tinnitus Clinic, based on Harley Street, said: “Levo has been specifically designed to be used during sleep when our brains are more likely to be responsive to and influenced by sound therapies. \n“It’s an innovative approach which has been demonstrated to provide relief from tinnitus symptoms faster than ever before. \n“During the assessment we identify and map the patient’s specific tinnitus sound, and then the Levo System creates a prescriptive ‘sound match’ which is presented to the patient via an iPod device whilst they sleep. \n“This stimulates the hearing centre of the brain to help it get used to the tinnitus sound and so reduces the volume and annoyance of the signal. GETTY Tinnitus treatment: Levo is to be made available to people living with tinnitus \n“As the leading provider of evidence-based tinnitus treatments in the UK we are very excited to be introducing this pioneering product. \n“Levo is one of an armoury of products we can offer and it widens the treatments available to include hard to treat atonal tinnitus, mixed tinnitus and very high frequency tinnitus. \n“We expect it to be popular with a number of people such as younger people who might not want to be seen wearing hearing adaptations during the day, those who prefer nocturnal treatments, those who have trouble sleeping and tinnitus sufferers who have exhausted other more traditional treatments.” \nAccording to The British Tinnitus Association, six million people in the UK are affected by the condition.
