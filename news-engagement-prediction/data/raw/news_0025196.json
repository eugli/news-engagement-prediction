Yesterday's load shedding was unnecessary. \nSouth Australian Treasurer and Energy Minister Tom Koutsantonis earlier today criticised AEMO for Wednesday's load shedding rather than turning on power at Pelican Point. \nAEMO executive general manager of stakeholders Joe Adamo said they did not have enough time to switch on the plant yesterday. \n\"We didn't want to overcook that which would have meant that we had a major power system issue over two jurisdictions,\" he said. \nMr Koutsantonis said the fact both units at Pelican Point would be turned on proved that Wednesday's load shedding was unnecessary. \nAEMO has also warned that a forecast potential shortfall of power in New South Wales on Saturday, could lead to load shedding in that state if the market did not respond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:53:26.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
