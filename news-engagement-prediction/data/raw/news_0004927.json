(Evan Agostini/Invision/Associated Press) Related Stories Silicon Valley pushes back at Trump immigration crackdown \nUber Technologies Inc. chief executive officer Travis Kalanick has quit President Donald Trump's business advisory group, he said in a company email reviewed by Reuters Thursday. \nThe CEO of the ride hailing service had been under mounting pressure from activists who oppose the administration's immigration policies, including Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. Silicon Valley pushes back at Trump immigration crackdown \n\"Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,\" Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in the email. \nHe said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order \"and its issues for our community\" and told the president he would not join the economic council. \nThe CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring entry to people from seven majority-Muslim nations. \n\"There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,\" he wrote in a note to employees. \"Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there's a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.\" \nThe move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive will attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned-board meeting. \nThe White House did not immediately comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:28:11.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
