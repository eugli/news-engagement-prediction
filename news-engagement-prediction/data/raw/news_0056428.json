PUBLISHED: 08:17,   09:43, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 GETTY Dutch MPs are set to vote through an EU-Ukraine deal rejected by voters in a referendum \nParliamentarians in The Hague were poised to approve the highly contentious pact between Brussels and Kiev which will grant 40 million Ukrainians visa-free access to Europe. \nTheir decision comes despite the fact that two-thirds of Dutch voters rejected the agreement in a referendum last spring, a result which establishment politicians immediately insisted they would ignore. \nAnd today they are set to come good on their word with the majority of MPs in the lower house of the Dutch parliament expected to row in behind Brussels and approve the pact. Related articles Fury as Dutch referendum results SNUBBED in Ukraine visa talks \nLate last year Dutch PM Mark Rutte secured a series of concessions from other European leaders which he insists together address the concerns of people who voted against the agreement. \nBrussels chiefs agreed to bolt on a legally binding paragraph to the accord which states that the treaty does not give Ukraine the automatic right to EU membership or financial and military support from Europe. \nBut critics have argued that the amendment does not address the issue of visa-free travel - a central theme in the referendum debate - and Mr Rutte refused to confirm that Kiev will not join the bloc in the future. GETTY Geert Wilders' party strongly opposed the agreement with Kiev GETTY But Mark Rutte says concessions he has secured address people's concerns \nEurosceptics said the move had echoes of the 2005 EU constitution scandal, when France and the Netherlands rejected Brussels’ plans for increased federalisation only for them to be railroaded through as the Lisbon Treaty. \nIn a strongly worded statement the political movement Geenpeil, which organised the initial petition which led to the referendum, said the decision would be a two-finger salute to ordinary voters. \nIt said: “One year, nine months and eleven days after this issue first emerged you just knew what The Hague would do - officially ignore the outcome of the first democratic referendum brought about by the citizens themselves. \n“This is an anti-democratic déjà vu of 2005 all over again. Confidence in representative democracy is again delivered another hammer blow.” This dossier has seriously undermined people's trust in politics PVV MP Harm Beertema \nMP Harm Beertema, member of Geert Wilders's anti-EU Party for Freedom, said “the objections of 2.5 million voters” were set to be ignored by his fellow MPs. \nRounding on Mr Rutte’s dossier of concessions, he raged: “This dossier has seriously undermined people's trust in politics.” \nConservative MP Pieter Omtzigt said he would also be voting against the “unimportant” deal secured by the PM in December, questioning whether it would be respected by other member states. \nHe told the parliament chamber he had written to all 27 other member states asking them about the text, and that of 20 who replied 15 of them said they had never even heard of it. \nBut Green MP Rik Grashoff said MPs should vote through the Ukraine deal despite admitting the choice was a “dilemma” given the result of last year’s referendum. \nHe argued that the reasons for strengthening ties with Kiev had only grown stronger since that vote in light of the expansionist and “intimidating” path pursued by Vladimir Putin ’s Russia. \nThe pact is also being backed by the pro-EU Labour Party, which is polling at just 11 per cent and faces near oblivion when the country holds its general election next month. \nLabour MP Marit Maij insisted: “This legally binding declaration clearly addresses the objections No voters had.” \nBut despite everything Mr Rutte refused to guarantee to opposition MPs that the Netherlands would use its veto to stop Ukraine joining the bloc in the near future, which was the biggest concern of all. \nHe would only say that an “overwhelming majority of member states is against” such a move, telling them he would not waste his breath making promises about something which would not happen. \nThe Netherlands is set to hold its next general election on March 15 with the anti-EU and anti-Islam politician Mr Wilder’s party currently leading the polls on 28 per cent of the vote.
