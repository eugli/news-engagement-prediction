Could   \nA young couple have bagged Britain’s cheapest house after buying their first home for just £1. \nFor less than the price of two first class stamps, Rebecca Dennis and Chris Benn purchased their first home together and have spent the last four months doing it up. \nThe Sunday People understands that the property is now believed to be worth £60,000 and the pair are on the property ladder eight years earlier than the average Brit. \nRebecca and Chris of Stoke on Trent, were thrilled when they landed a place on Stoke-on-Trent city council’s home ownership scheme which offers residents the chance to buy a house for £1.

The £1 price tag is a special bonus! \n“We really had to fight for it - even though it meant me taking on my third job and upping my hours it was totally worth it.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:46:13.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
