modified on Tuesday 21 February 2017 12.02 GMT \nWhile a flurry of snow threatens to fall outside at any moment, Sanaw, a 30-year-old Kurdish Christian from western Iran, is proudly describing his involvement in a nativity play over Christmas. \nHe holds court at a table of eight fellow refugees, explaining in coherent German how the local theatre group, of which he has only been a member for a matter of months, has helped to improve his sense of belonging in Cologne, his home city for just over a year. \n“Even though I’m living in a refugee camp, I was able to interact with a few locals,” he says, as the group listen intently. “And I was also able to learn German without doing a course.” \nSanaw, a graphic designer who ran his own agency back home, is one of the growing number of users of Cologne Public Library’s sprachraum (language space). \nThe sprachraum, a large ground-floor room that sits opposite the main library building, serves as both a meeting point and learning hub for the city’s migrant community – which, as of December 2016, is 13,253-strong . \nFrom a UK vantage point, Cologne Public Library – which recorded more than two million visitors in 2015 – stands in direct contrast to prevailing trends. According to a BBC investigation last year , 350 libraries have closed across the UK since 2010, contributing to 8,000 job losses. Addressing the House of Lords in October, Big Issue founder John Bird urged for urgent action to be taken to ringfence library funding. \n“If you are going to cut libraries you must be prepared to build more prisons, to build more homeless hostels,” said Bird. “Libraries are essential, yet what is happening is that they are being cut.” Migrants congregate at one of the workshops hosted by Cologne Public Library. Photograph: Sarah Dudek \nHis argument was supported by Baroness Gail Rebuck, Labour peer and chair of the Penguin Random House publishing group, who said: “Libraries should be seen as key community centres, open to all, where, alongside books, people can rely on other essential life services.” \nIn Germany, however, libraries appear to have retained their cultural status. According to broadcaster Deutsche Welle , footfall in German public bibliothecae actually grew by 5 million people between 2013 and 2015. Libraries should be seen as key community centres where people can rely on other essential life services Gail Rebuck \nThat’s not to say they have been without their own budget fears. But unlike many of their UK counterparts, German libraries have better adapted into dynamic spaces with a bent towards digital and community engagement as well as printed matter. \nMany public libraries in Germany , including Cologne, now include “maker spaces”, in which users can experiment with new technologies, including 3D printers and virtual reality glasses. For every study room, there is likely to be a cafe or children’s play area. \nOn this cold Saturday afternoon, the group is here for “ Offene Deutschhilfe ” (literally “Open German Help”), a weekly workshop aimed at helping refugees in a range of matters, from German vocabulary to filling in job applications and finding accommodation. \nAs Susanne – one of the two volunteers hosting the session – recommends to Sanaw an free recital held by the Chamber Philharmonia Cologne, one-to-one language lessons are taking place on tables dotted around the space. Others are at workstations reading emails; a man in an oversized bomber jacket pours himself a coffee. Cologne locals take part in a pro-immigration rally in 2015.

At that time, we didn’t have anything.” \nIt was around this point that Vogt discovered an abandoned room across the square abutting onto the library’s main entrance. The librarian pitched the idea of a space exclusively for refugees to City Hall, which was paying rent on the property. \n“They agreed instantly,” says Vogt. “It then took us three or four months to finalise the room and get all the furniture. It’s now been open for around 18 months, and it’s in good condition. If you have a nice space, people will always take good care of it.” \nToday, the sprachraum counts the Red Cross as one of its key partners, as well as several “private initiatives”, says Vogt. It has also seen its number of volunteers – on whose custodianship the space is entirely dependent – increase from 20 to over 50 in the last year. \nThe volunteers come from a broad cross-section of Colognian society, explains Sarah Dudek, sprachraum coordinator. “They consist of everyone from students, university lecturers and retired teachers, to advertising professionals,” she says. “We’ve also started to have volunteers who are migrants themselves, and who have similar stories to the new refugees.” Cologne Public Library. The number of people visiting libraries across Germany grew by 5 million people between 2013 and 2015.

Sundays aside – when public libraries, like retail stores and supermarkets, are required to shut by German law – sprachraum has a busy calendar,holding daily events. \nThese include games afternoons, arts and crafts sessions, and well as mentoring sessions for families and children. Recently, the library – one of Germany’s biggest – also kickstarted a joint digital storytelling project with counterparts in Malmöo, Roskilde and Athens, through which refugees are encouraged to share their personal experiences. \nWhile its social media presence may need tightening up, new people are finding their way to the sprachraum all the time through a mix of lessons put on in the library and subsequent word of mouth. \nFor Vogt – who has held the directorship in Cologne since 2008 – the sprachraum embodies the shift in the role of the 21st- century library; a byword for community engagement. “It’s a space that belongs to the public,” she says. \nCould UK libraries learn from its example? Absolutely, she argues, citing other German institutions running their own refugee programmes. They include the Association of Public Libraries in Berlin, which is the first German library association to provide library cards to refugees without demanding an official certificate of registration – normally a strict prerequisite in Germany.

They are engaged in this.” \nShe believes Germany’s libraries, particularly in the bigger cities, have an obligation to meet the needs of asylum and refugees. Libraries in the UK, which has taken far fewer refugees– perhaps feel less of an onus to do the same, suggests Vogt. \nBack at the “ Offene Deutschhilfe ” session, introductions are being made. Following Sanaw’s lead, Nizar, also from Syria, is discussing his hopes of returning to his true vocation as a tailor. He currently works as a caretaker in a local hospital. Vogt, who drops in on the session, reveals there is a sewing station on the fourth floor of the library, and suggests he bring some materials the next time he is over. “Maybe you could sew something for the [Cologne] carnival this month,” says a member of the group, and is met by a chorus of encouragement. Nizar smiles.

A spate of sexual assaults on women in Cologne on New Year’s Eve 2015 was linked to migrants, providing fodder for far-right populist groups such as Alternative for Germany and Pegida . \nSome are finding the challenge harder than others. \nIbrahim, a 32-year old Libyan and IT professional, describes his fruitless hunt for a flat. “I don’t stand a chance,” he says. Mohammed, a 30-year-old hospital worker, speaks of his hopes of doing a master’s degree but fears he will be precluded of the chance due to limited placements. \nMichael, an Eritrean who has lived in a hostel for the past five months following a “catastrophic journey” from his homeland via Libya and Italy, simply wants to meet more of his fellow townsfolk. \n“I don’t know any,” he says, “apart from the ones I meet here at the library.” At this, the whole group nods in agreement. “And you fill this room with life,” replies Dr Vogt with a warm smile. \nSome of the names have been changed. \nFollow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive here Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:14:03.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
