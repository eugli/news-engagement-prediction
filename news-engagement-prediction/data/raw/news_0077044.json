Another major op took place last July and Nusaybah faces yet another when she’s three.\nIn all, she has already undergone surgery seven times in her life.\nNusaybah and her dad Zaid Credit: BPM She’s shown that the experts don’t always get it right.\nThe second operation was the most risky. When we handed Nusaybah to the surgeon, we kissed her goodbye.\n– Nusaybah Ahmed's dad, Zaid Nusaybah and her siblings Credit: BPM For Nusaybah, a simple infection could be catastrophic. For that reason, she cannot attend nursery.\nToday, she looks like any other healthy toddler, with only the tube attached to her nose. The birth defect prevents the heart’s left side developing.\nNusaybah was born naturally and weighed a healthy seven pounds.\nShe spent the first nine months of her life in hospital and the parents underwent training before their daughter was allowed to go home.\nWe were taught life-saving. And because of the risk of cardiac arrest, an alarm system was installed.\nChildren are a blessing and bring so much joy and happiness into your life. They make you appreciate what you have.\n– Nusaybah Ahmed's dad, Zaid Last updated Sun 26 Feb 2017 Health West Midlands Birmingham", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:10:16.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
