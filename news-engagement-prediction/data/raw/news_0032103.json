Of the 222 tracked by EY, 15pc said they expect to move some staff, while 10pc actively re-committed themselves to the UK. \nThe figures indicate that there is no headlong rush to the door - despite fears from some in the sector that the vote to leave the EU would prompt an exodus from the City of London.

The UK's ecosystem - built up over many, many years - is unique,” said Mr Ali. \n“We have a close-knit network of industries that work well together, an attractive legal and regulatory framework and a global reputation for talent, innovation, high quality service and easy access to finance. Despite the climate of uncertainty and change, there is every reason to be confident that the UK will remain one of the world's preeminent financial services hubs.” \nRob James, an analyst at Old Mutual, said he expects banks to keep most of their operations in London, while it could be European companies that have a major re-think, working out how they can best access the financial services on offer in Britain.

Locations such as Frankfurt simply don’t have the capacity to take on this industry,” he said. \n“One solution could be to reverse the process, so that large European companies in need of investment banking services could access them via their non-EU subsidiaries. This may work, as it seems unlikely that the Europeans would want to prevent corporates from accessing such an essential service as a result of Brexit.” \nM eanwhile recruitment firm Morgan McKinley found only a small slowdown in financial services hiring. \nEmployers typically go on a recruitment spree in January and this year was no different - the number of new jobs on the market shot up from 4,980 in December to 9,015 last month. \nBut that is slightly below the 9,180 the firm found a year ago, and it would usually expect the number of new vacancies to more than double in January. \nThe number of jobseekers fell more sharply, down by almost 30pc from 16,924 a year ago to 12,068 now. \n“Many of our non-British clients are choosing to return home, or seeking opportunities elsewhere in Europe,” said Morgan McKinley’s Hakan Enver. \n“People wanting to get ahead of the threat of having their right to work revoked is understandable, but is a huge loss for the City.” \nA ccording to real estate group Colliers International, however, London remains the most influential city in the world. \nLondon has topped its index, which looks at factors including talent, location and costs, which indicates that the capital is highly attractive despite the worries around Brexit. \n“London may be one of the most expensive cities from a real estate standpoint but when taking all factors into consideration, and the ability of the city to re-invent and evolve, it is superior to all other major European cities in this study,” said Colliers International’s Damian Harrington. \n“Recent announcements at the end of 2016 by global tech giants such including Apple, Google, Facebook and IBM re-affirmed their commitment to the future of the London and UK economies.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:14:20.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
