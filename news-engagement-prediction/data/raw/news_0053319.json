( George Jiang via Flickr ) \nThanks to the February surge of spring, the pollen season has started weeks ahead of normal in Washington. It is making allergy sufferers miserable much sooner than they’re accustomed to, but it may have an upside: earlier relief in April. (Susan Kosisky) \nTree pollen counts have surged into the high range prematurely. Typically, this doesn’t happen until March. \nGrass pollen has even been detected, which is highly unusual, according to Susan Kosisky, who runs the U.S. Army Centralized Allergen Extract Lab in Silver Spring. \nKosisky said this is the earliest she’s seen so much pollen so soon since 2012, following Washington’s third warmest winter on record. “2012 was our premier early peaking year,” she said. “Tree pollen peaked at the end of March instead of the end of April, the normal peak.” \nThe pollen also burst out of the gates early in the spring of 1998, in the wake of another very warm winter in Washington, Kosisky said. “As the weather goes, so does the pollen blow,” she said. \nAn advantage to the early start to pollen season is that counts may also decline early if the weather remains mild. Kosisky said that it’s a misconception that an early start to pollen season necessarily means it will be prolonged. If it stays warm, “there’s no reason the trees won’t keep flowering and releasing their pollen,” she said. “We’ll have an earlier peak season, and you’d start to feel better in April.” [ Nature says spring is here! Flowers are blooming and frogs are mating. Loudly. ] \nKosisky cautioned, however, that once pollen is introduced to allergy sufferers each season, it becomes difficult for them to totally shed symptoms due to what’s know as the “priming effect.” The pollen initially released revs up immune systems so they become more sensitized to additional pollen even in smaller doses. \nAllergy symptoms may also be prolonged if the weather turns cold and wet in March. While such conditions would slow pollen production and offer temporary relief, a second surge would become inevitable once the weather warmed up again. \nThe 2016 pollen season featured such a double peak (green line in chart below). Counts first spiked in early March due to unseasonably warm temperatures but then they plateaued through early April as temperatures leveled off relative to normal. A second and more potent peak came in mid-to-late April, when temperatures soared into the 80s. (Susan Kosisky) \nBased on the forecast for above normal temperatures in the 50s and 60s over the next couple of weeks, expect pollen levels to remain generally high. However, a huge early spike, which typically requires an extended period of sunny weather in the 70s and 80s, isn’t likely.

It was the warmest March on record. \nThis March is unlikely to be as warm as March 2012, favoring a somewhat more gradual and later pollen peak, though still likely earlier than normal given this season’s fast start. 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:22:16.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
