The Vols then lost 76-75, completing another come-from-way-ahead-loss. \n(What's next for the Vols?   Vols newsletter now!) “It was a goal-tend,” Barnes said, beginning his answer to Rucker’s question even before it had ended. “You can’t hit the ball, and the ball was in the cylinder. It’s a play. I can only (attest) to what they told me, and the TV copies showed and from what we saw, the ball was definitely being touched. \n“It’s a big play. We should’ve … the clock should have been stopped at 7.6 (seconds) or something like that. Again, that’s what we were told and what we saw. There’s a hand on the ball, and the ball is at the cylinder. Whether it is or not, the ball is coming down.” \nBarnes was quick to point the finger in a 76-75 loss that, for now, severely dampened the Vols’ NCAA Tournament hopes at his own team’s defense. \nPlus, Barnes noted, Georgia also has seen absurdly poor officiating impact it this season. The Bulldogs were controversial losers in a road game last month at Texas A&M due to a “clock malfunction.” \n“Again, it’s a tough one but then you still have to score again. You get a chance anyway,” said Barnes, had the call been made for a goal-tend. “But no one’s had tougher luck than Georgia this year, so I can’t sit here and complain about that. \n“They’ve had more bad bounces than anyone in the country. But 51.8-percent field-goal percentage defense? That pretty much says it all.” Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T09:16:09.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
