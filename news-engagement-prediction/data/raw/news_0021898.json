But with the Bombay High Court ordering four 'objectionable' scenes to be deleted from the courtroom drama, Arshad is perhaps as disappointed as the makers.\nSays the actor, \"We had to go through the same [legal hassles] last time too, after a few lawyers filed a petition against us, demanding the release be stalled. However, we had a more generous judge last time. He pulled up the petitioners, saying, 'Do you want me to show the kind of spelling mistakes you make?' (referring to a scene in the trailer that triggered the petition).\"\nCalling out mischief makers, he says people tend to target the film industry to push their personal agenda. \"The bigger the star or the movie, the more mileage one gets. People make all kinds of noise but the sad part is that the law machinery doesn't care.\"\nSo, can we conclude that the cold war with Jolly LLB 2 director Subhash Kapoor has now ended? Arshad passes on his phone to show he made two calls to Akshay earlier in the day.\n\"With Kabir [Khan], Subhash or even Raju (Rajkumar Hirani), there can never be bad blood. I know if I am required to do something, they will call me. I am not going to force myself on friends and mess up their films. I was never upset about not getting Jolly LLB 2. Akshay and Subhash are friends; nothing can change my equation with them,\" he says.\nAlso read... \nCensor vs Court? CBFC chief Pahlaj Nihalani fumes on 'Jolly LLB 2' row: We know how to do our job \n \n \nArshad Warsi: Akshay Kumar and I keep talking about 'Jolly LLB 2' \n\n \nMakers bow before SC \nAfter the Bombay HC ordered four cuts in Jolly LLB 2, the makers yesterday told the Supreme Court (where a hearing was scheduled) that they wouldn't like to pursue their appeal. Akshay Kumar (right) later told mediapersons, \"I respect High Court's decision. I always believe in abiding by rules, and we have made the changes. There is no argument about it. There'll be four cuts in one scene. The movie will release on February 10 (as slated).\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:12:58.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
