Credit Stephen Crowley/The New York Times The good news is, the human brain is flexible and efficient. This helps us make sense of the world. But the bad news is, the human brain is flexible and efficient. This means the brain can sometimes make mistakes. You can watch this tension play out when the brain tries to connect auditory and visual speech. It’s why we may find a poorly dubbed kung fu movie hard to believe, and why we love believing the gibberish in those Bad Lip Reading Videos on YouTube. “By dubbing speech that is reasonably consistent with the available mouth movements, we can utterly change the meaning of what the original talker was saying,” said John Magnotti , a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas. “Sometimes we can detect that something is a little off, but the illusion is usually quite compelling.” In a study published Thursday in PLOS Computational Biology, Dr. Magnotti and Michael Beauchamp , also a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine, tried to pin down why our brains are susceptible to these kinds of perceptual mistakes by looking at a well-known speech illusion called the McGurk effect. By comparing mathematical models for how the brain integrates senses important in detecting speech, they found that the brain uses vision, hearing and experience when making sense of speech. If the mouth and voice are likely to come from the same person, the brain combines them; otherwise, they are kept separate. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “You may think that when you’re talking to someone you’re just listening to their voice,” said Dr. Beauchamp, who led the study. “But it turns out that what their face is doing is actually profoundly influencing what you are perceiving.” The McGurk effect was discovered serendipitously when a psychologist named Harry McGurk mistakenly believed he heard the sound “da” after watching a video in which the sound “ba” was dubbed over a girl’s lips saying “ga.” Forty years later, scientists have demonstrated this effect in thousands of studies, in infants and adults, in different languages, in cases where the genders of the voice and mouth don’t match and even in cases when a person touches, instead of watches, a moving mouth. But the McGurk effect is also limited. If you close your eyes and just listen, you’ll hear “ba,” and if you watch the lips silently, you’ll hear “ga.” If you reverse the dub, you don’t integrate the sounds either. The effect accompanies only certain syllables. Why do some mouth and voice combinations produce the illusion and others do not? As we encounter people talking — voices babbling, mouths moving — our brains are constantly making calculations to help them pin down what voices belong to what mouths. The brain asks itself: “Is it likely that these two things go together or not?” Dr. Magnotti said. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
