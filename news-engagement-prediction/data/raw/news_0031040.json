S, +2.17% and T-Mobile US Inc. TMUS, +0.22% have been chipping away at Verizon’s customer growth, thanks in part to those carriers’ aggressive pricing for unlimited data. Last year, AT&T Inc. T, +0.17% started offering unlimited data plans to customers who also sign up for its DirecTV satellite service.\nVerizon VZ, +0.35% added 2.3 million of the most lucrative type of monthly customers in 2016 — only about half the 4.5 million it added in 2015.

Last month, Verizon’s finance chief, Matthew Ellis, said on a conference call with analysts that unlimited data plans were “not something we feel the need to do.” At $80 a month for a single smartphone, Verizon’s new unlimited plan is only $10 more than a current Verizon plan that includes just 4 gigabytes of monthly data.\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\nRichard Thaler: Here's the best investing strategy (1:31) Professor Richard Thaler, an expert in behavioral economics, talked to MarketWatch about his 'lazy' investing strategy that allows investors to maximize their returns while doing very little.\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\nMexicans vow to fight Trump by jamming U.S. courts.\nTrump administration begins deportation raids across U.S.\nMore from MarketWatch How to Prepare for a Lost Smartphone A Drone Tour of China's Rusting Shipyards Earnings releases are still a confusing mess, and it’s investors who pay the price", "external_links": ["https://www.wsj.com/articles/verizon-in-a-reversal-brings-back-unlimited-data-plans-1486944189?mod=mktw", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-begins-deportation-raids-across-the-u-s-1486771279?mod=mktw", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexicans-vow-to-fight-trump-by-jamming-u-s-courts-1486768500?mod=mktw"], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:33:54.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
