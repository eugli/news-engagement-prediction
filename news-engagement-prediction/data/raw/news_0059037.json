Michele Noad stood in the same spot she was snapped by Google (Photo: SWNS.com) Her friend Rick Hodge was left baffled by the coincidence (Photo: SWNS.com) \nShe said: \"I told him I'd be stood on the corner by B Block reception, so he Googled it and found where I was. \n\"When he arrived, he said I'd never guess what he found on the map, he had spotted me. We couldn't believe it. \n\"The odds of this is more than million to one chance - let alone being on the spot he had to pick me up at. Surreal.\" \nMrs Noad reckons the Google Street View photographer took her photo when the company was mapping the area last September. Mrs Noad thinks she was snapped by Google while nipping out for lunch last September (Photo: SWNS.com) \nThe self-employed council consultant will be leaving her job at the council in the coming months and added: \"Everyone is saying how there will be a piece of me always stood outside county hall.\" \nMichele was waiting to be picked up by her friend Rick to go and have dinner with him and his wife Penny when he spotted the photo. \nShe said she thinks it was taken by the Google Maps car-mounted camera while she was popping out to lunch. Mrs Noad described the 'million to one' coincidence as \"surreal\" (Photo: SWNS.com) \nThe married mum-of-two said: \"Rick wasn't sure where the B-block reception was so he checked on his computer before he left work and saw me. \n\"I said I would stand out by the road so he could see me \n\"He came to collect me and said 'you're not going to believe this but you are standing on this corner on Google Maps'. \n\"I said 'I'm not' but back at their house we checked and there I was. \n\"I have tried to look up the odds but I think it is just such a freak thing, it's impossible to work out. \n\"I'm moving to work in Hampshire and I'm going to miss Somerset so much but I have told me colleagues if they miss me they can just look on Google.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:42:15.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
