That is why it is one of the key pillars of our Industrial Strategy. \n\"We want to see the UK space sector flourish, that is why we are laying the groundwork needed for business to be able to access this lucrative global market.\" \nA number of consortia are already pushing to use horizontal launch systems. \nThese would see rockets carried by planes to an altitude where they would then be released to make their way into orbit to deliver a satellite. \nFor safety reasons, this activity would be done somewhere over the ocean, but ministers have not ruled out the possibility that conventional vertical lift-off rockets could also be launched from the UK. \nAnd although satellites are the focus of business leaders, it is conceivable that \"tourist\" flights on sub-orbital rocket planes could become part of the services being offered. \nIn 2014, the government identified eight coastal aerodromes that might become a spaceport. \nAt the time it was thought, officials would pick a \"winner\" - as if it was a competition. \nBut ministers' views have changed. They now see the establishment of spaceports as a bottom-up process. \nIt is up to consortia to come forward with a realistic plan that includes a practical site and a committed launch provider. \nGovernment's role is to be a regulatory facilitator and cheerleader; ministers are not interested in using substantial public funds to build spaceport infrastructure or to support launch operations.
