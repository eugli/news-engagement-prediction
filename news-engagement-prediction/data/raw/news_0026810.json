Comment on This Story Staff Photographer Injured Dallas Cowboys rookie outside linebacker Jaylon Smith works out during morning practice at training camp in Oxnard, California, Thursday, August 11, 2016. (Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News) By SportsDayDFW.com Contact SportsDayDFW.com on Twitter: @SportsDayDFW \nThe latest Jaylon Smith video shows off some interesting work the Cowboys draft pick is doing on his surgically repaired knee. \nIn the latest video, Smith is seen hurdling obstacles as well as shuffling to the side and taking off. — Jaylon Smith (@thejaylonsmith) February 15, 2017 \nSmith, a linebacker out of Notre Dame, suffered a serious leg injury in his final game for the Fighting Irish but was still drafted by Dallas in the second round. His injury kept him on the sidelines all season. \nSmith had surgery early last year to reconstruct his left anterior cruciate ligament and during his recovery he dealt with a drop foot condition that has required him to wear a brace. Smith said in January the brace \"is not a limiting factor at all\" and if he had played this postseason he could have played with the brace on and competed at an 'elite level.' \nThe biggest concern has been the firing of nerves in Smith's knee, but Smith said last month that they're starting to regenerate. \nSmith has been sharing videos of his progress pretty regularly. Past videos have showcased his speed and other qualities. Lab Work day 1!
