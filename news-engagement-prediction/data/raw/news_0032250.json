Who knows, she might even chase down Black Caviar’s famous 25-race winning streak.\nChris Waller, Winx’s trainer, admitted he was aware but tried not to focus on the Phar Lap record going into the Apollo Stakes.\n“I try not to read too much or listen too much about the records but I knew she was out to equal Phar Lap today,’’ Waller said. “I try to keep it in perspective, Phar Lap backed up week in, week out over all distances.\nmedia_camera Winx blew her rivals away in the Apollo Stakes at Randwick. Picture: Mark Evans\n“But we are not sheltering Winx, either. We are running in all the best races but we do protect her in terms of how many runs she has each preparation.\n“It is always good to get that first race over with and we can look ahead to the rest of her autumn campaign.\n“We know the day will come when she is not quite there and she is beaten. There might be another champion that comes along and takes her mantle.\n“We are prepared for that but we are enjoying it while it lasts.’’\n. @HugeBowman over the moon after Winx takes out the Group 2 #ApolloStakes at #Randwick . pic.twitter.com/wjv7FISqOt\n— TAB (@tabcomau) February 13, 2017 Winx is without equal on turf in world racing right now and she made a statement in her Apollo comeback on Monday – the champion mare could be better than ever.\nShe started at $1.14 favourite and cruised away from a crack field in the Apollo, including her old rival Hartnell ($12), to win by nearly three lengths.\nHartnell is an outstanding galloper in his own right and rated among the top 10 in the world. He was very good on Monday and put four lengths on the rest of the Apollo field, with Endlesss Drama ($26) finishing third, but Winx was in a league of her own.\nSuch a great advertisement for what the racing game can offer, watching champion athletes like Winx and Black caviar! Need more of it!\n— Dom Tourneur (@domjock) February 13, 2017 Winx and Hartnell have now clashed five times and it is 5-0 in the mare’s favour, with an aggregate winning margin of more than 20 lengths, which only underlines her superiority.\nNearly 6000 race fans came to Randwick yesterday, many arriving within a half hour of the race and Winx delivered as expected.\nBut there was a moment, albeit briefly, at the 600m when Winx was left flat-footed as the field began to sprint for home.\nmedia_camera Macca’s take on Winx equalling Phar Lap’s mark of 14 straight wins.\nJockey Hugh Bowman admitted riding any other horse he would be worried – but Winx is not any other horse.\n“I just encouraged her to pick up the tail of Tye Angland’s horse (Endless Drama) which she did and within a blink of an eye, it was all over,’’ Bowman said. “It is a privilege to ride Winx, she is great for our industry.’’\nThe final word to Bowman, a country boy at heart, who hails from Dunedoo, an area of NSW devastated by bushfires over the last three days.\nBowman’s property and that of his parents nearby are understood to have largely escaped the ravages of the firestorm but the jockey admitted some of his life-long fiends in the region have lost property and livestock.\n“I’d like send a cheerio to all those in Dunedoo who are battling the bushfires, it has been very tough for them,’’ Bowman said. “This is a nice, little story in hard times for the people at home.’’\nWe've seen two 'once-in-a-generation' horses inside five years in Winx and Black Caviar.
