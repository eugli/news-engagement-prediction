Photo: Mary Urech Roberts, Houston Chronicle Image 23 of 23 George Strait talks about 'Tennessee Whiskey,' the hit song that he passed on in the '80s 1 / 23 Back to Gallery \nCountry legend George Strait recently told a Facebook Live audience that he passed on recording what’s become a legendary country hit for others. \nTo be fair it’s not as if Strait hasn’t had enough hits. He holds a record for most number one hits (60), which is more than any other artist in music across Billboard and other industry tracking services. There is a reason he’s called the King of Country, with apologies to the later great Bob Wills. \nTHE KING SPEAKS: George Strait says he doesn't see a lot of his influence in country music today \nDuring the interview to promote his ongoing residency at the T-Mobile Arena is Las Vegas, opening act Kacey Musgraves asked Strait some fan-submitted questions about his life and career. \nAt one point Strait was asked if he had ever passed up any songs that later became hits for somebody else. Strait said that he passed over songwriter Dean Dillon and Linda Hargrove’s “Tennessee Whiskey” which in recent years has become a hit for Chris Stapleton, one of the country genre’s newest shining idols. \nDillon, as you may well know , has written over fifty of Strait’s hit songs. He’s a big deal to say the least. Kenny Chesney and Toby Keith have also hit pay dirt with his song craft. \nAFTER THE WHISKEY: Texas icon George Strait shares his favorite hangover treat \n“Dean pitched that to me in the ’80s. I think it was around ’85, ’84 or something. And, I just didn’t, I didn’t… I missed it,” Strait said of the song. \nThe nominees for the 52nd Academy of Country Music Awards have been announced. The ACM awards are the oldest awards in country music. The nominees were announced by Lady Antebellum. Male Vocalist of the year includes Keith Urban. Female Vocalist includes Miranda Lambert and Carrie Underwood. Carrie Underwood is also nominated for Entertainer of the Year. Lady Antebellum were nominated for Group of the Year. The ACM awards, country's biggest night, airs Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 8pm on CBS. Media: MediaOS Video \nDavid Allan Coe had recorded and released his own version in 1980 and George Jones followed suit, hitting chart gold with it in 1983. \nMaybe Strait, who turns 65 years old in May, can perform the song live at some point this year. \nHe still has scattered dates in Las Vegas in April, July, September and December at T-Mobile Arena, where he has a worldwide exclusive engagement. \nMeanwhile you can for sure hear Stapleton's own version on Thursday, March 8 when he plays the rotating stage at RodeoHouston.
