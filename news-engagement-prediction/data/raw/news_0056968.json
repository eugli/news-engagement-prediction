Mine were apricot jam, strawberry jam, and dark plum jam.\" \nMs Hopkins said the essential element was the quality of the fruit and she made her jams from the orchard on her family's farm.

(ABC South East NSW: Bill Brown) \n\"There's around 150 years of cow and pig manure in that orchard,\" she said, pointing to fruit trees up to four metres high with trunks many hands wide. \nShe said that in more than 30 years of making jam, she had learned by trial and error and also from the passing down of secrets from wise country women. \n\"There's a lot of 'secret squirrel' business in jam-making but I've been given a few secrets, so I'll give some away,\" she said. Chemistry of prize-winning \nWhile stirring a pot of plum jam, Ms Hopkins steps through the process, beginning with weighing the fruit. \n\"The books say one kilo of fruit to one kilo of sugar, but that means you lose the taste of the fruit,\" she said. \n\"I don't like jam that tastes like sugar, it needs to have a strong fruit taste, but that means you have to reduce the sugar. \n\"But if you don't put that equal quantity of sugar to fruit it doesn't set without jam setter, and we're not allowed to use any thickening agent in the shows.\" Photo: Roxanne Hopkins with her champion show ribbon for her jam collection. (ABC South East NSW: Bill Brown) \nMs Hopkins said the solution was to use lemon juice to set the jam and then try using 750 grams of sugar to one kilo of fruit. \n\"But not just any lemons — especially not supermarket lemons! Get them fresh from a tree or buy some from a farmers market,\" she advised. \nThe process begins with slicing the fruit and putting it, with the seeds in and skins on, into a pot with a heavy base and then covering with the sugar. \n\"Let it stand there for about an hour or so, and let the sugar soak through the fruit,\" Ms Hopkins said. \n\"Then put it on a low heat and stop it from burning by stirring it slowly. When the sugar's dissolved and the fruit has worked down a bit, then you bring it to a boil. \n\"Mix it around and then you'll get a fruit skim on the top. Take that off with a spoon and throw it away.\" \nShe takes the pot off the heat and uses a potato masher to break up the fruit, separating it from the seeds, and then removes the seeds and skins. \n\"That's when you really can taste it, and then you can add the lemon juice. I just do it to taste but it's usually one or two lemons,\" she said. External Link: Bega Show FB page \nBut Ms Hopkins has another secret. \n\"Then you boil it again. Wait until the bubbles start to change, and they look very thick like you're making toffee,\" she revealed. \n\"Then do the taste test. It's too late to add sugar after you've boiled it and boiled it, but you can fix it with lemon juice if you need.\" Making jam a 'dying art' \nMs Hopkins said it was important not to get distracted because if the jam burned even slightly then all the jam was ruined. \n\"If you've had enough, just turn it off and come back to it later and bring it to the boil again,\" she said. \n\"This plum jam we're looking at is the second day of cooking. If anything, it tastes better the next day.\" \nThe final stage is to fill the jam into jars that have been sterilised. \nMs Hopkins heats her previously sterilised jars and lids in the oven and fills them with hot jam. \n\"When you put hot jam into the warm jars and you twist the lid tight it will form a seal and will be airtight,\" she said. \nThis year Ms Hopkins fell short of winning the collection at the Bega show, but her plum jam was awarded first prize, as was her blackberry jam, and apple jelly. \n\"The shows are a wonderful community affair. What a wonderful way to show your produce off,\" she said. \n\"People in the cities don't realise that this is what shows are all about. It's a dying art really — people making jams.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:50:27.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
