Some of the messages Antony Ray sent Anna (Picture: SWNS) Anna felt betrayed (Picture: SWNS) \nAnna, from Rough Common in Kent, said: ‘He broke my trust, took away my right to choose. I did not consent to having a relationship with a married man, or a man who was actively having relations with multiple women simultaneously.’ Teenager died after branch snapped and he hit head on submerged rock \nAlthough he’d used Khan’s photo, he eventually sent Anna real photos of himself and the two met up in person on November 3, 2015. \nAfter that first meeting, he then visited her at home twice a week for six months, claiming that his work as a businessman required him to travel often to Germany and Ireland. \n‘He walked into my house with a quiet confidence, calm and an ease that felt like he had done the same every night for years,’ Anna said. \n‘It was like he was supposed to be there. He instinctively knew how to hold me. It was like I’d known him and him me for far longer than we had.’ ‘Antony’s’ fake profile – which used a picture of Saif Ali Khan (Picture: SWNS) \nBut his visits suddenly became far less frequent. The two met on May 3, but then Anna didn’t see him for another five months. Girl fighting for life after school hall ceiling collapses on her \nWhen the distance, lack of contact and unanswered calls became too much to bear, she re-downloaded Tinder and started chatting to Antony Ray, using a fake profile. \nHe immediately gave her the same spiel as before – that he wanted things to be ‘all or nothing from day one’– until she finally let on who she was. \nSoon afterwards she uncovered his real identity – a top legal executive who spent his working week in London, and his weekends at home with his family in the north of England. Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan, whose photos were used for the fake profile (Picture: SWNS) \n‘His alias was a clever twist on his real name,’ she said. ‘Then I sat and cried and cried. Worst of all was finding out he was married. \n‘Everything that hadn’t added up over the months, all the red flags and bad gut feelings over things that I had felt and pushed aside because I trusted him more than I did myself, or he had given me a reasonable answer to a question or I’d told myself I was being paranoid.’ How to spot the symptoms of meningitis \nAfter speaking publicly about her ordeal, Anna started a petition to force anyone with an online dating profile to use their real name. \n‘I am a victim of a catfish approach. Using a fake profile and online identity as a platform to lure women or men for sex should be illegal, but it’s not,’ she said. \n‘The result is the other party believing they are beginning a real relationship with the hope of a future together and having sex is part of that believed relationship. \n‘Creating a fake online profile with the intent to use women or men for sex, should be a crime under the fraud act, communications act and sexual offences act.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:30:00.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
