LoBiondo is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and has the power to bring an independent investigation into the Trump administration, according to the protesters. \n\"We understand that the intelligence agencies are doing their jobs but the House committee is dominated by Republicans -- the Senate committee is dominated by Republicans,\" said Elizabeth Volz, 49, of Glassboro. \"We want an independent investigation into Russian influence into this administration.\" \nVolz is the founder of United Progressive Democrats and organized Tuesday's protest. \n\"The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is conducting a bipartisan investigation into Russia activities,\" LoBiondo said in a statement. \"As a member of (House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence), I respect the classified nature of the inquiry. At the conclusion of our investigation I will push for a declassified report to be made available for the public and press.\" \nThe congressman was in South Jersey late last week and met with over 100 constituents about their concerns, according to his office. \nTweeting cop accused previously of assault \nDemonstrators Tuesday came from around his district, some driving more than an hour to chant in front of his office. \n\"It's important to be here because I'm a citizen of the United States, I'm a voter, and I feel that our power is in expressing our first amendment right in speaking out when we feel there is an injustice or something wrong with our government,\" said Dr. Janine Sobel, 61, of Harvey Cedars. \nOne of the people leading the chants was 12-year-old Julian deLaszlo, of New York City, who loves political discourse almost as much as he enjoys making music. \n\"I feel that this is really important, to go into areas where it is mostly Republican to show people what democracy looks like and how you can't just pick a TV star and say, 'Oh you are president,'\" Julian said. \nRebecca Ivory, 35, of Swedesboro, drove an hour to protest Tuesday and has to drive back afterward to nursing school for a quiz. Her husband is in the U.S. Navy and she considers herself Republican, having voted for John McCain for her first election. \nShe voted for Hillary Clinton last election. \n\"I am terrified that he is going to do something that puts my husband directly at risk,\" Ivory said. \"I do not trust him. I am not sure whether he is willfully ignorant or just ignorant. he doesn't choose to surround himself with people who understand the world at large.\" \nBefore returning to the protest, Ivory had one message for LoBiondo. \n\"Please, please go to the center of the party,\" she said. I am a republican. I believe the future of the party is in the center and he needs to move to the center and if he doesn't do that, he is going to be primaried. There's no question. We will find someone to primary him.\" Don E. Woods may be reached at . Follow him on Twitter @donewoods1 . Find NJ.com on Facebook .
