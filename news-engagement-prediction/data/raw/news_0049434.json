In 2015 he denied certain things, in 2017 he flip flops. It puts everything he says in doubtful light at this stage,” Abella said. ADVERTISEMENT \nAbella said the Palace and the President himself were not inclined to respond to Lascañas’ allegations unless brought to the proper court. \n“The situation is such that the testimony of the man is in a context where there seems to be a lot of other noise. We would not be responding to those allegations. If these are truly valid, it should be brought to the proper court not here,” he said. \n“It’s not brushing aside, what we’re saying is it’s part of a larger noise,” Abella added. \nOn Monday, Lascañas echoed the testimony of another confessed DDS member Edgar Matobato and affirmed the existence of DDS. He said Duterte paid them by as much as P100,000 for every killing depending on the target.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:01:53.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
