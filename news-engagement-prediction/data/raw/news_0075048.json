That's 10 per cent over the Canadian average.\nThat could be because West Coasters are paying more attention to U.S. news. The survey found 94 per cent of B.C. residents are following political developments south of the border, compared to 83 per cent across the country.\nThey are more likely to have chatted both Canadian and American politics with family, friends or coworkers over the last couple months, according to the survey, and to have posted about Trump on social media.\nAnd British Columbians appear to have the most faith that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be able to stand up to the leader of the free world, at 66 per cent. Albertans showed the least faith in Trudeau, at 37 per cent.\nThe Insights West survey was conducted from Feb. 23 to 25 among a representative sample of 1,001 Canadian adults.\nPolls of that size have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 per cent.  \nRelated Stories Trump tower opens in Vancouver but the welcome isn't warm Photos President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with county sheriffs in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 7, 2017.
