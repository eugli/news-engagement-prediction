When asked about the future course of action, Thackeray said, “What is the hurry? Wait for some time. We have not yet decided if an alliance has to be made or not. We will do so soon.” \nNoting that the “overwhelming blessings” in Maharashtra came after Odisha, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ‘thanked each and every Indian for continuously placing their faith in BJP’ and said “We are working determinately to create a strong and inclusive India.” In a series of tweets, PM Modi praised BJP workers, particularly Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and state party president Raosaheb Danve Patil, for tirelessly working for the people.

The BJP, however, fell short of four seats from achieving a full majority as it notched up victories in 77 seats — up from its previous tally of 26. The NCP got 44, Shiv Sena 10, Congress 16 and MNS six. \nCity Guardian Minister and BJP leader Girish Bapat credited the BJP-led governments at the Centre and State for its grand showing in Pune. He claimed Pune residents rejected the NCP and Congress because of their laggard attitude towards the key civic issues. “The credit for the win goes to the good governance and decision making shown by State and Centre governments, hardwork by party workers and terrible governance of PMC by Congress and NCP in last 15 years. Puneites knew that it wasn’t just sloganeering. The metro project wasn’t only cleared but a huge budgetary allocation too was made,” Bapat said.
