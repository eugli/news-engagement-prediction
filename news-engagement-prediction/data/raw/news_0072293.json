For the past six years the city has been reeling from a development frenzy, with each passing week seeming to bring news of a new motorway, rail line, casino, airport or some other large, intrusive thing that precisely no one ever asked for. \nNow comes the news that the proposed relocation of the Powerhouse Museum to Parramatta may cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion. And while that may sound like an obscene amount of money, relax – it's actually a bargain and the only reason you can't see that is because you are not a visionary planning genius like the Urban Einsteins running NSW.

More videos Will you visit the Powerhouse in Parramatta? \nFor some visitors to Sydney's Powerhouse Museum, its relocation to Parramatta will make the trip easier; others say they will cancel their memberships. \nClearly they know what they're doing even if we don't. So in keeping with the zeitgeist, here are 10 suggestions for \"Other Stuff That Should Be Relocated To Parramatta At Great Expense And For No Reason Whatsoever\": \n1. The Big Banana The astonishing cost of moving the Powerhouse Museum 20km \nBecause why the hell not! There's no doubting that the \"The World of Bananas\" is a cultural phenomenon, but it is completely wasted in its current location. So, move over Coffs Harbour – bring it to the people and let the good times roll. \n2. The Big Merino (aka \"Rambo\") Advertisement \nYou know it, I know it, we all know it. This. Just. Has. To. Happen. The biggest concrete scrotum in the southern hemisphere deserves the kind of recognition that only a prominent location on the banks of Parramatta River can offer. Sorry, Goulburn, but you've had your chance – this is an idea whose time has come. \n3. The Monorail Link New home?: The big Merino, the monorail and Bondi would be more than welcome in Parramatta. \nLight rail, schmight rail. What people really want in the 21st century is a monorail. And personalised jetpacks, they definitely want those, too. But let's stick to the monorail for now. Everyone now knows that Sydney's original monorail was a brilliant idea ahead of its time. Twenty-nine years ahead, to be precise. It's time. Again. \n4. Darling Harbour Share on Twitter TWEET Link City of Sydney councillor Linda Scott says the Powerhouse Museum should be part of the city's \"cultural ribbon\". Photo: Powerhouse Museum \nAll of it. After all, the Powerhouse will be bloody lonely without all of its mates. It's time to face facts: Darling Harbour has always been the right idea in the wrong place, and no amount of jazzy makeovers are going to fix that. And just think of all the extra hotels and serviced apartments that could be squeezed on to the site once it is freed up. Case closed. Next! \n5. Bankstown Airport The Big Banana: move it to Parramatta. Photo: Getty Images \nEveryone knows that airports are the beating heart and soul of any modern city. And no city centre is complete without its very own \"aerotropolis\". What some may consider to be a shonky real estate term for \"low-rent business park located near a noisy airport\", others understand as being a road map to the future. Sorry, Bankstown, but it's time to pull rank and inaugurate the era of the Parramatta Aerotopia. \n6. NSW Parliament \nNo joke this one, it simply should happen. For real. \n7. That Place That Used To Be \"Leyland Brothers World\" \nJust the replica of Uluru should do it. It'll be the perfect riverside companion piece for Rambo, with the two forms combining as an elegiac landscape symphony evoking the historical juxtaposition of our First Nations and colonial cultures. Or not. \n8. Taronga and Western Plains zoos \nBoth zoos in one convenient location. Think of the development yield Taronga's current site could offer, freeing up the revenue desperately needed to pay for all those executive salaries in NSW Treasury, whilst at the same time try to imagine the massive carbon footprint that will be saved by sparing everyone those long car and bus journeys to Dubbo. I know, I know – it's almost too much to take in at once. An absolute no-brainer from start to finish. \n9. Bondi Beach \nIf Parramatta can't go to the surf, then bring the surf to Parramatta. Seriously, why did no one think of this before? \n10. Trump Tower \nBecause no global city is complete without its own world-class icon and, believe me, nothing screams world-class more than Trump Tower. It's gonna be beautiful, baby, so beautiful. It's gonna be the biggest, most beautiful tower you've ever seen, more beautiful than anything else anyone has ever built, anywhere, in history, period. It's gonna be great, we're gonna build it and you're gonna love it. Trust me. \nSo there you have it, Parramatta – your blueprint for global city success. Now, to where do I send my invoice? \nChris Brown is a town planner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:06:30.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
