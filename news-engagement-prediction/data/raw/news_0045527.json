All done and dusted.” \nKhan, 46, was arrested on suspicion of “at least one crime of corpse desecration” after Portuguese police found Alyn’s body at the couple’s home on February 9. \nShe is due to stand trial this month and could face up to two years in jail. \nKhan and Alyn, a lorry driver from Edinburgh, had lived at their ramshackle house in Linhares da Beira in north-east Portugal for more than three years. \nAlyn’s daughter described it as “a shack” and her brother said his father and Khan “lived off the land”. Louise and Alyn \"lived off the land\" in Portugal, his son said \nNeighbours of the couple contacted the police after Alyn wasn’t seen for several months. Officers used ground-penetrating radar to locate his body. \nAlyn’s children say he had been fighting a brain tumour for around three years but they were never told he was ill. There is no suggestion his death was suspicious. \nThe daughter, a pregnant mum-of-two who lives near Airdrie and asked not to be named, told us she had been estranged from her dad for six years. \nShe said he and Khan, his second wife, lived in Lochgelly in Fife but then left the country without telling her or her brother. \n“We went to Fife a few years ago,” she recalled. “But the neighbours said they’d sold up and moved to Portugal.” \nShe also relived the shocking way Khan broke the news of her father’s death. She said: “On Facebook it was a very quick message. She just said: ‘Oh yes, your father died...’ \n“I was like, ‘What are you talking about?’ \n“I thought it was a joke at first. She hadn’t told us my father was ill. \n“When I asked about the funeral, she just replied: ‘All taken care of. All done and dusted.’” \nShe said she tried to find out more but Khan switched off her phone. \n“She’s a horrible, horrible person,” she added. “I don’t understand why she would have buried him like that. I thought he would have died in hospital if it was a brain tumour. \n“She was always very strange and got stranger as the years went by. She comes across as aloof and very intelligent but she is completely off her head.” \nAlyn’s daughter would now like her dad’s remains returned home. And when she was told Khan could face prison, she replied: “Oh thank the Lord.\" Alyn's children described Louise Khan as \"completely off her head\" \n“Sorry, but thank the Lord. I’d love to see her jailed for this. \n“We’ve not had closure. We’ve had nothing to grieve over – no, body, no ashes. \n“If he had a brain tumour, why was he not in hospital? It must have been a horrendous, painful thing to go through if he was just at home. \n“Maybe dad consented to this before he passed. I just don’t know. The whole problem here is the lack of communication.” \nAlyn’s son, the older of the children, also told of his contempt for Khan. \nHe said: “I’ll hate Louise forever. She denied us the opportunity to say goodbye to our father. \n“We were gutted. Louise wasn’t interested in giving us any information, just that he’d passed away. \n“I’m not surprised by all this. She was that type of character. There was nothing she wasn’t capable of. \n“Sadly, I hadn’t spoken to my dad for about five years, which was his choice. But your dad is your dad. \n“I’d have gone out there if I had known he was dying. I wish Louise had phoned, even a week before. I have no respect for her for not telling us.” Both children said it is possible their father agreed to be buried in the garden \nThe son, who also asked us not to name him, said Alyn and his mother divorced around 20 years ago and he then met Khan. \n“We never thought much of Louise but we never rocked the boat,” he said. \n“I don’t know how they met. They married in the late 1990s. They loved each other and were well matched. \n“They weren’t social and were both quite strong-willed. \n“They lived in a very remote place. They were just living off the land, growing fruit and veg, keeping chickens. \n“I don’t even think they had electricity. It was a throwback to the 1800s, a stone cottage with an outside toilet. \n“I think they wanted somewhere warm where they wouldn’t get bothered.” \nThe son believes Alyn got his cancer diagnosis about a year after moving to Portugal and had been coming back to the UK for treatment. \nHe said: “I understand he was told last summer that he’d be lucky to see the end of the year.” \nThe son believes Alyn might have approved of the plan to bury his body at the house. \nHe said: “Dad was that type of person. He might have looked at the funeral costs and said, ‘You know what, dig a big trench in the garden and fling me in.’ They didn’t have a lot of money.” \nWhatever the story behind the bizarre burial, it has left Alyn’s children in limbo, unable to grieve properly. \nThey have tried to arrange a trip to see his grave, but were unable to find out where he was buried. \n“I tried to research it,” said Alyn’s son. \n“I went to Citizens Advice and called Edinburgh council for help. They emailed back to say they had no trace of him at all. \n“I phoned the Portuguese consulate in London and they said they couldn’t help due to data protection.” \nIt’s not clear exactly when Alyn died, but a Portuguese TV report claims WH Auden’s poem Funeral Blues was posted on a Facebook page linked to Khan on October 1 last year. \nKhan was held in custody for three days after Alyn’s body was found. She was then released on condition that she reports to a local police station every day. \nThe police believe she failed to report her husband’s death in Portugal or the UK. \nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “We remain in contact with the Portuguese police following the arrest and subsequent conditional release of a British woman.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:04:09.900+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
