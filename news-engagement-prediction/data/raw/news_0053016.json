In his most recently uncovered remarks, the columnist appeared to be endorsing paedophilia as a way for young boys do \"discover who they are\".\nHe rose to notoriety during the Gamergate controversy, and was ultimately banned from Twitter for inciting a wave of racist trolls onto Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones.\nRead more Yiannopolous disinvited from CPAC as 'pro-paedophilia' video found Nonetheless, Simon & Schuster's imprint, Threshold Editions, paid Yiannopoulos a $250,000 advance to publish his memoirs. But the blogger seems to have crossed a line for the publisher, after they stood by their decision to give Yiannopoulos a platform in their catalogue for two months.\n​\"After careful consideration, [Simon & Schuster] and its [Threshold Editions] have cancelled publication of Dangerous by Milo Yiannopoulos,\" tweeted Simon & Schuster spokesperson Adam Rothberg.\nYiannopoulos responded to the news in two terse statements posted to Facebook. \n\"They cancelled my book,\" he wrote. \"I've gone through worse. This will not defeat me.\"\nYiannopoulos was recently disinvited from the Conservative Political Action Conference after a podcast emerged in which he appeared to endorse sexual relationships between “younger boys and older men”.\n\"Due to the revelation of an offensive video in the past 24 hours condoning paedophilia, the American Conservative Union has decided to rescind the invitation of Milo Yiannopoulos,\" wrote ACU chair Matt Schlapp.\nStatement: After careful consideration @simonschuster and its @threshold_books have cancelled publication of Dangerous by Milo Yiannopoulos\n— (((Adam Rothberg))) (@AdamRothberg) February 20, 2017 In the audio, recorded on the Drunken Peasants podcast, Yiannopoulos said young boys \"discover who they are\" through such relationships. And even if they are sexual in nature can \"give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable rock where they can't speak to their parents\". \nMilo Yiannopoulos defends Breitbart headlines as 'satire' \"Paedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old, who is sexually mature,\" he also said. \"Paedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty. Paedophilia is attraction to people who don’t have functioning sex organs yet who have not gone through puberty.\"\nYiannopoulos responded to the ACU via Facebook and said he “deeply regret[s]” the way his comments were interpreted, stressing that he is “horrified by pedophilia” and said he has “devoted large portions of my careers as a journalist to exposing child abusers”.\nActivists Protest Racism And Hate In Brooklyn 15 show all Activists Protest Racism And Hate In Brooklyn 1/15 NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 20: People participate in an anti-hate rally at a Brooklyn park named in memory of Beastie Boys band member Adam Yauch after it was defaced with swastikas on November 20, 2016 in New York City.

But I understand that my usual blend of British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humour might have come across as flippancy, a lack of care for other victims or, worse, 'advocacy'.\"\nBut the controversy surrounding perhaps the most prominent figure of Breitbart – save for Steve Bannon – has led to the possible exodus of staff of the right-wing publication. \n\"The fact of the matter is that there’s been so many things that have been objectionable about Milo over the last couple of years, quite frankly.
