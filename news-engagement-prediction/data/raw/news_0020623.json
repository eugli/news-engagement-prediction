The day a Turkish writer's life changed By Selin Girit BBC News, Istanbul 8 February 2017 Close share panel Media caption Asli Erdogan: 'Solitary confinement was much more difficult than I had ever imagined' \"My whole life changed with one sentence: 'Open, police!',\" says award-winning Turkish writer Asli Erdogan, her soft voice in stark contrast to the dramatic scene she describes. \nDetained in August last year, she is one of many Turkish intellectuals facing criminal charges since the failed coup in July 2015. \nShe was still in bed when the special forces team came banging on her door, she tells me. \n\"They were dressed as if they were going to war. Bulletproof vests, automatic weapons. It was summer and I was in shorts,\" she says. \n\"I begged them to give me a minute to get changed. They didn't. One of them pointed his weapon to my chest and said 'Don't move!' I was shaking. Altogether perhaps 25-30 policemen came in. The building was surrounded by snipers too. It was a big operation.\" \nMs Erdogan spent over four months in pre-trial detention, charged with one of Turkey's most serious offences: disrupting the unity and integrity of the state. She is also accused of terror propaganda and being a member of the Kurdish militant group, the PKK. \nShe was on the advisory board of pro-Kurdish newspaper Ozgur Gundem, a paper that focuses on the Kurdish conflict and faced dozens of investigations on suspicion of supporting the PKK. \nLinguist Necmiye Alpay, 70, was arrested with her. Their case prompted international concern over the state of freedom of speech in Turkey. Both were released pending trial in December. Who is Asli Erdogan? She was born in 1967 and published her first novel, The Shell Man, in 1994 Her major breakthrough came with The City in Crimson Cloak, which has been translated into over a dozen languages including English Her texts were adapted for theatre, dance, radio and film She wrote columns for several papers and touched on taboo subjects such as torture, prisons, the Kurdish issue and women's rights She studied computer engineering and physics and in 1991-92 worked as a research physicist at CERN (European Organisation for Nuclear Research), where she completed her thesis on the Higgs particle \n\"From the moment I was taken to the police station, it was like a joke,\" Ms Erdogan says. \n\"Even the prosecutor knew that I was not the founder of the PKK, still I found myself in jail. But what was my crime actually? Being an adviser to a newspaper? \n\"The absurdity reaches so high a level that we have to use the term Kafkaesque or reinvent another term to define today's Turkey,\" she adds. \nIn the crackdown following last year's coup attempt, some 40,000 people have been jailed. Many others have been imprisoned for allegedly having links to the PKK. \nTurkey is currently the world's biggest jailer of journalists - with some 150 behind bars. Over 140 newspapers, magazines and television channels have also been banned since a state of emergency was declared after the failed coup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:43:51.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
