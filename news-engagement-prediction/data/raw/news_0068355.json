Manchester United celebrates. Source: AP \nUnited responded manfully to the sending off and held firm to keep a fourth successive clean sheet in European competition and secure their place in Friday’s Europa League last-16 draw. \nPre-match odds as long as 40-1 on St Etienne going through highlighted what an uphill task the hosts faced, yet their fans turned out in their droves at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard. \nThe hosts’ intensity and endeavour had proved problematic last week, but this time Mourinho’s men did not attack with the same numbers that saw them caught out last time. \nBut when United first threatened, they left St Etienne with a bloody nose and all-but settled the tie. \nMata sent in a superb, low cross from the left flank and Mkhitaryan provided a deft touch, having burst in-between the home side’s centre-backs to the edge of the six-yard box. \nIn Wednesday’s other ties a 1-1 draw between Schalke and Greek side PAOK was enough for the Germans to progress after winning the first leg 3-0, while Russia’s FC Krasnodar advanced to the round of 16 for the first time following their 1-1 draw with Fenerbahce.
