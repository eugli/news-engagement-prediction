Laura Jeffares, centre, plays Mary Poppins \nThere will be a flying nanny and dancing on the ceiling in Hawke's Bay this March. \nNapier Operatic Society is bringing Mary Poppins to the region in the most technically demanding production the organisation has ever staged, with flying cast members and a massive rotating stage. \nThe musical, which runs from March 10 to 25 at the Napier Municipal Theatre, follows the same story line as the beloved film and book. PHOTO: MEGAN HUNT/FAIRFAX NZ \nYvonne Arrowsmith and Bev Carroll check the fit of a coat for Laura Jeffares who plays Mary Poppins. \nMary Poppins arrives at the home of the Banks family in London, bringing magic to the lives of the adults and children she encounters. \nREAD MORE: \nStage director Marc Collier said the society was part of a consortium of New Zealand theatre groups which collectively bought the rights to the production then pooled funds to professionally build a set and costumes. \nThese pack down into three large shipping containers and will visit 11 theatres in total. \nThe Napier society has staged technical performances before, \"but not to this degree\", Collier said. \nMary Poppins flies, Bert walks up walls and characters disappear up a chimney. \n\"This is specialised stuff, we have riggers coming down from Auckland and approximately $45,000 worth of rigging will be used,\" he said. \nOne of the main pieces of set is a massive five-metre high house which opens like a large dolls house, then rotates. \n\"It's moving all the time,\" Collier said. \nDetails and colour are projected onto the white set to allow the backdrop to change and move. \nThe house alone takes six people to move during the performance. \nTogether with the stage hands, lighting crew, make up and costume team there were at least twice the number of people putting the show together back stage than those performing. \nPreparing the cast started in August with workshops, auditions in September and rehearsals in October for the onstage cast of 56. \nFavourite songs from the film, along with iconic magical tricks will be recreated on stage. \"It's going to be a really fun show for people to see.\" \nWith such a big cast even supplying biscuits, tea and coffee for months worth of rehearsals mounted up. \n\"It's quite a risk but we love bringing these big shows to Hawke's Bay audiences,\" Collier said. \n* Children's tickets range from $15, adults from $35 and a family pass for two adults and two children from $85.
