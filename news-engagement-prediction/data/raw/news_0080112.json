'Savagely violent' \nThe court heard Saunders was jealous of the couple who started a relationship in July 2016 after he and Miss Morgan split up. \nAfter making threats to kill the pair in the weeks before, he waited for them outside the Matalan store before launching his attack at about 05:50 BST. \nWitnesses saw him attack Mr Simmons first, stabbing him \"in a frenzy\" as he pleaded for him to stop. \nHe then moved on to Miss Morgan telling her \"I'm coming for you next\" as she tried to help her boyfriend. \nHe chased her down the street, eventually caught up with her outside the Boots store where he stabbed her several times. Image copyright Matthew Horwood Image caption Andrew Saunders pleaded guilty to murdering Zoe Morgan and Lee Simmons on 19 December \nSentencing Saunders, Mrs Justice Nicola Davies described the killing as \"savagely violent conduct\". \nShe said: \"Whatever your mental state, you took the lives of two people. You robbed the families of Lee Simmons and Zoe Morgan of a much-loved son and a much-loved daughter.\" \nShe added there was a \"significant degree of planning\" before the killing as he bought the two knives he used the day before the attack and searched the internet for ways to kill. \nAfterwards, he phoned his mother telling her what he had done and sent a text message to his father saying: \"Just killed two people, cheers.\" \nWhen he was arrested, he confessed to officers: \"I'm sorry, you know sometimes, you just snap.\" \nSpeaking after the hearing, Kelly Huggins, from the Crown Prosecution Service, described the killing as a \"brutal, unprovoked and premeditated attack\" and said Saunders showed no concern for witnesses who were subjected to a \"frightening scene of violence\". \nIn a statement, Miss Morgan's family said their lives had been changed forever by their daughter's murder. \nIt read: \"I hope that every day Saunders is thinking about what he has done to us and what he has done to our beautiful daughter. We will think of Zoe for the rest of our lives.\" \nLee Simmons's family said no sentence or punishment would ever compensate for the loss of his life, adding they would never be able to forgive Saunders for \"selfishly taking Lee away from us\".
