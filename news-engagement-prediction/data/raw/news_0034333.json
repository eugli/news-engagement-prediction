Orlando never coalesced into a playoff contender as they expected. \nIbaka will be an unrestricted free agent this offseason. Toronto intends to re-sign Ibaka and not simply make him a rental for their playoff push this season. Masai Ujiri has long had interest in acquiring Ibaka. \nRoss signed an extension with the Raptors worth $33 million over three years in 2015. Ross is due $10.5 million in 17-18 and 18-19 before becoming an unrestricted free agent. \nThe Raptors own two first round picks in this year's draft and will send the lesser in value of the two between their own and the Clippers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T23:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:10:47.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
