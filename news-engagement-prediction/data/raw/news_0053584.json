The government clearly thinks so. \n“But on a matter of this importance, has not the government a duty to be sure before our departure becomes final?”\nRead More A crucial meeting that helped decide the course of Brexit was held at this Wetherspoon's Lord Butler accused Brexiteers of being too scared to give the British people a second vote on the final deal.\n“One has to ask why those who base their arguments for Brexit on the will of the people are now opposed to consulting the people on the outcome of the negotiations,” he said. \nLawyer Lord Pannick also got involved - and urged peers to amend the Brexit Bill “One has to suspect that they fear that they will get a different answer.”\nPeers will hold a series of votes over the next fortnight on whether to amend Mrs. May’s Brexit Bill. \nPossible concessions include giving extra rights to EU nationals, giving Parliament a meaningful vote on the final Brexit deal and even - in a move pushed by the Lib Dems - demanding a second referendum. \nToday the lawyer who helped win the Supreme Court case that gave MPs a vote on Brexit sounded a stark warning over the final deal. \nLord Pannick, who sits in the Lords as a crossbench peer, said Theresa May's promise of a final vote for parliament - though not the public - should be written into law.\nHe added it was time for peers to \"live up to our constitutional responsibility\" and amend the Brexit Bill, which gives Mrs May authority to pull two-year EU exit trigger Article 50. \n\"A political promise made by the Prime Minister in good faith is no substitute for a clause obligation in an Act of Parliament,\" he warned.\n\"Political circumstances can change, Prime Ministers can change over the next two years.\nPro-Brexit Lord Lamont said it would be a mistake to give parliament a final vote (Photo: PA) \"On a matter of this importance it is vital to ensure that there is a clear and binding obligation on the government.\"\nBut Lord Lamont, the Conservative pro- Brexit former Chancellor, told peers it would be a mistake to let parliament have a vote on the final deal that could result in Britain staying in the EU. \nHe said: “Firstly, it would be a denial of the result of the referendum and secondly, as surely as night follows day, it would make it perfectly inevitable that the EU would offer the worst possible deal in order to have it rejected by parliament.\n“I believe in democracy and I believe that we should proceed rapidly with this Bill without delay.”\nAnd a peer who believes to be the last living Tory MP who voted against joining the EU said she will probably cry with happiness when Brexit happens.\nBaroness Oppenheim-Barnes said she had not regretted her original vote against joining the bloc for a moment, calling Brexit \"a fantastic opportunity\".\n\"If it does happen, and all goes well, I will have a small tear in one eye, probably, at the thought of the day may dawn when I will see us leaving Europe,\" she said.\nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Lord Lamont Theresa May Tony Blair John Major Margaret Thatcher EU Referendum European Union House of Lords Brexit Public services Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:08:10.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
