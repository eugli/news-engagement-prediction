By the second week of Cubs camp, he was cruising the Phoenix area in a Polaris Slingshot he briefly considered buying. And by the end of last week, his newest, biggest tattoo — on his left arm, commemorating last fall’s World Series title, complete with gold-inked trophy — was done and ready for display. And if you think any of that sounds flashy, you should see him play baseball. “Yes, and there’s not a thing wrong with that,” manager Joe Maddon said. “That’s who he is. You like the way he plays second base? I’m not changing anything about that.” \nBaez turns a double play against the Dodgers during the NLCS as Addison Russell watches. Baez underscored Maddon’s point in the fifth inning of Sunday’s exhibition game against the Cleveland Indians, bolting to his right to make a sliding, backhand snare of Chris Colabello’s shot toward center, then leaping to his feet and throwing back across his body to rob Colabello of a hit on a play that wasn’t particularly close. “I’ve often said I like a chrome-less kind of an infield,” Maddon said. “However, if somebody comes equipped like he has, I don’t want to necessarily tone that down. What I’ve talked to him about is making the routine play more routinely, and then permitting his athleticism to take over on the more magnificent play, which he does. Because all the bells and whistles are in his tool bag already.” Polaris Slingshot Baez drove last week. Magnificent? Bells and whistles? One longtime scout who has followed the Cubs in recent years said in each of the last two seasons that Baez is the organization’s best shortstop. The scout emphasized that’s no knock on Addison Russell — last year’s National League starter in the All-Star Game. Russell, also a Gold Glove finalist last season, is widely considered one of the top young shortstops in what some are calling a golden age for the position, with under-25 star shortstops in the Indians’ Francisco Lindor, the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Corey Seager, the Boston Red Sox’ Xander Bogaerts, the Houston Astros’ Carlos Correa and the Colorado Rockies’ Trevor Story. “Probably the last time would have been the [Derek] Jeter-[Alex] Rodriguez-[Nomar] Garciaparra group,” Maddon said of the crop of shortstops who debuted in the mid-1990s. Add Baez to the list above, and the Cubs have two of the seven under-25 young shortstops in the game. “If Javy was on another team, we’d be talking about Javy among these starting shortstops,” Maddon said. No wonder Maddon has been wearing a T-shirt with “D-Peat” across the front. Baez, 24, is on a World Baseball Classic roster for Puerto Rico that includes Lindor and Correa. “We’ve got a hell of an infield,” said Baez, who expects to play a lot of second base during the tournament, with Correa sliding to third. But that doesn’t mean Baez, the high school star shortstop drafted No. 9 overall in 2011, no longer considers himself a shortstop. “When I play short, I love it, obviously, because that’s how I grew up playing,” said Baez, who figures to get maybe a dozen games at short this year as he floats across the infield in a super-glove utility role. He occasionally wonders where he might fit in with this generation of shortstops if he played for another team. “It’s tough. Obviously, you don’t control [or] pick a team,” he said. “But if I ever get traded or something happened here and I had to play short, or second . . . it doesn’t matter to me.” Of course, the grass isn’t always greener, a sentiment that might as well be tattooed onto his left arm. General manager Jed Hoyer says Baez should have a chance to win a Gold Glove in the role he plays now.

This guy’s a Gold Glove player. He should have a Gold Glove.” Follow me on Twitter @GDubCub.
