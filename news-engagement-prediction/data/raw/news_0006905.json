USA TODAY Sports NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell poses for a selfie photo with fans at a fan forum event Friday in Houston. (Photo: John David Mercer, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON – Some wore NFL jerseys, mostly representing the Houston Texans, but the majority of the gathering of 70 fans-turned-questioners did not. That was the first surprise. \nThere were two men in colorful hard hats, one with a bobble head wiggling on top of his. There was one fake Mohawk, and a man near the front had painted his face. That was no surprise. \nThey all had been invited to come to downtown Houston Friday morning, to the House of Blues, known this week as NFL House, for a fan forum with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and three NFL stars who are finalists for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year award: Larry Fitzgerald, Eli Manning and Greg Olsen. \nWhat happened next was a big surprise: smart, insightful and even a few humorous questions, one coming right after another. Of the 20 or so questions that were asked, three began with a mention of the NFL’s collective bargaining agreement with its players. \nMORE SUPER BOWL COVERAGE: Secretive anti-Trump protests to erupt Super Bowl weekend in Houston \nOne dealt with the possibility of expanding the regular season to 18 games, the second with potentially relaxing the league’s penalty for marijuana use as various states change their laws regarding use of the drug, and the third with the controversial topic of how the NFL metes out its discipline. \nNone of Goodell’s answers was earth-shaking or even newsworthy – he towed the party line, which was expected – but the questions were impressive. The CBA as a preamble for three fan questions? I sure didn’t see that one coming. \nBut the biggest surprise of the day came after the hour-long session ended. Interviews with five of the 70 people in the audience revealed that no one from the NFL had told them that any issue was off-limits, had screened their questions or even knew what they were going to ask before they were called upon to ask it. \nFrank Taylor asked one of those questions, the one about the league’s policy on marijuana use. He and his wife Buffie flew in from their home in Charleston, S.C., at the invitation of a friend, Texans’ season-ticket holder Reggie Destin. \nDestin received an e-mail a week and a half ago from the Texans inviting him to be one of 50 season-ticket holders, along with a few guests, to come to the event. \n“They said we could ask any question we wanted,” Taylor said. “They said no question was off limits but just keep it clean. They had no idea what I was going to ask, not a clue.” \nTaylor said he was pleased with Goodell’s answer, which sounded like this: \n“What we do is we rely on our medical experts, and to date those medical advisors have not recommended that we change our policy,” Goodell said. “Obviously we’re aware of (the legal changes in some states), particularly in the medical area. We’ll follow that closely. If for some reason there is a change that can benefit our players that is medically supported with research and facts, then we’ll certainly consider that.” \nThe fan forum differed significantly from Goodell’s news conference with the news media Wednesday in that there were no questions about his relationship with the New England Patriots. \nWe probably can chalk that up to the dearth of fans of the Patriots (and Atlanta Falcons) at Friday’s fan event. When the group was asked who was cheering for whom, there was mild applause for New England and Atlanta, then a roar for the Texans. \nThere was nothing surprising about that.
