Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA London TV worker is claiming she was sacked from her job at a Soho production company for being “too good looking”. \nEmma Hulse says she was sent home from her shift at the central London TV company by a manager who told her: “You should be on a catwalk”. \nThe 24-year-old, who lives in Mayfair, said she was only five minutes into her eight-hour freelance shift when her boss told her to leave. \nCompany UNIT TV, based on Great Marlborough Street, accepted the incident happened and have since dismissed the employee who was allegedly involved.

Then my agent text me that I’m no longer required. I got there and spoke to the line manager and he asked me, ‘are you a model? Are you not doing catwalks, why are you not at the front of house?’ \n“I was wearing a lipstick but from my perspective I was not inappropriate. I was wearing a shirt and trousers. I really didn’t think I looked inappropriate.” The TV worker said she was wearing lipstick but was not dressed inappropriately (Photo: Instagram/@hulseemma) \nShe alleged he asked for her private number and suggested they went for a drink. \nMs Hulse added: “I was quite disappointed to be sent home. I didn’t really know what to do. \n“Maybe that company employs plain looking people and maybe if you don’t look that way they don’t take you, maybe I was a distraction. \n“I do camera operating as well, I work for many different companies and no one has sent me home because of the way I look. Especially within a creative agency you should be free to wear what you want.” Read More Teacher sacked after bosses learned of porn career past wants her job back Emma believes she may have been a \"distraction\" (Photo: Instagram/@hulseemma) \nAdam Luckwell, owner of the company, said that the employee who was allegedly involved was dismissed at the end of a three month probation period. \n“We found there were a number of things we were not happy with,” Mr Luckwell said. \n“We felt she was a bad fit for us and some of the things she was doing was not in line with the company’s policy”.
