Court documents show Derbas asked IJ to pay for the hotel and he deposited $600 into her bank account. Sanaa Derbas pleaded guilty to 11 fraud-related offences after tricking the seven victims into lending her money Court documents show the Sydney mother-of-four befriended the men via telephone-based dating services Derbas did not book the hotel and on the day they were supposed to meet she contacted IJ and told him her mother had collapsed and was in hospital. She then posed as a family member and called IJ, telling him she was 'Tianna' and confirming their mother had passed away. Derbas told another victim she met in 2010 to deposit $600 in her bank account so she could book a night in a hotel in Cronulla for them. He deposited the money, but no booking was made - and Derbas told the man that her daughter was sick in hospital so she could not meet him. The same victim was later told her daughter need surgery for tonsilitis and deposited various amounts of money into her account to cover hospital expenses. Derbas offered various other fictitious reasons as to why she needed further sums of money, and told him she would receive $1million from her grandfather which she would use to repay him. Within the space of a few months, Derbas told the victim her daughter had died while undergoing surgery and her mother had died after collapsing due to an aneurysm. The victims initially transferred money to Derbas (pictured) for hotel rooms before she offered excuses for not meeting them, including sick relatives and various calamities In sentencing Derbas, Judge Paul Conlon said her 'intricate web of lies' demonstrated a talent for impersonation TEXTS THAT LURED HER VICTIMS January 8, 2013: From 'JR' to Derbas – “Baby, thnks yr text reply. I cant get access to any borrowings and I also have no savings since I had to stop work at the end of August last year. Please understand how much 2012 was a struggle to survive. Love U always, princess” From Derbas – “I love you, cant wait to be with you. I haven’t eaten since yesterday. I have nothing left till the money gets to your account”. March 1, 2013: From JR – “Hello my princess. Rec’d yr txt, thanks. My pension here 2 day can spare 100 for yr tucker, while we wait. Shall I organise 4 U baby? Anxious to have you return in prime condition. Loving U as ever\" From Derbas – “Hi baby, can you please send me 200” Between February and July 2010, that victim - known as 'HP' - paid Derbas $186,093. Derbas later told one man her young son had died of swine flu, while she requested money from others to pay for her dead mother's funeral. Crown prosecutor Eric Balodis said Derbas may have been unable to control her gambling, but her moral culpability with respect to the fraud was quite different. 'It's calculated and controlled,' he told Sydney's Downing Centre District Court on Thursday. Defence barrister Greg Jones said his client liquidated all her assets to pay back the money and worked seven days a week to support four children. She also acted as a carer for her mother and brother, who had a mental disability, Mr Jones added. 'There has been a substantial change in her life and her environment since these matters in 2008,' he said. Within the space of a few months, Derbas told the victim that her daughter had died while undergoing surgery and that her mother had died after collapsing due to an aneurysm =Her offending involved 'calculated cunning and guile' and she was 'utterly determined' to bleed victims of funds, he said Derbas tricked her victims into lending her money which she used to fund her gambling and cocaine habits, and to build a house In sentencing Derbas, Judge Paul Conlon said her 'intricate web of lies' demonstrated a talent for impersonation. Her offending involved 'calculated cunning and guile' and she was 'utterly determined' to bleed victims of funds, he said. 'Those she targeted were largely vulnerable people,' Judge Conlon said. 'The victims were all simple men who lost sums of money that was, of course, significant to them.' Derbas was handed a three-and-a-half-year sentence with a non-parole period of 18 months. She began sobbing in the dock and pleaded with the judge as a large contingent of family members looked on. The courtroom became tense when a young family member threatened the media.
