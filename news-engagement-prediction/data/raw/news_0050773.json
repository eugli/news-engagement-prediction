This time last year, the Vols had 13 wins with four games left in the regular season, after Kevin Punter went down with a season-ending stress fracture in his foot following a loss at Kentucky. Tennessee went 1-4 to close the regular season without its leading scorer, beating LSU then losing four straight. The Vols found life in the SEC Tournament with wins over Auburn and Vanderbilt, before running out of gas against LSU, playing a third game in three days. “When I think about 15 wins in the last year I think it would have been different if Kevin Punter wouldn’t have gotten hurt,” Tennessee coach Rick Barnes said on Saturday. “I do think that.” \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

Freshman forward John Fulkerson has been out since December after dislocating his elbow and breaking his wrist after a hard fall against Lipscomb. Freshman point guard Jordan Bone missed nine games with a stress fracture in his foot. Junior guard Detrick Mostella was dismissed in January — Tennessee’s second-leading scorer at the time — after a violation of team rules. Still, the Vols have positioned themselves with two weeks left in the regular season to significantly improve on last season’s win total — not to mention keep playing to meet their postseason goals. “With this group, we have set our goal to be a team that is in the hunt every year,” Barnes said. “We set our goals to be in the NCAA Tournament. We are in position, but we are going to have to earn it.” Tennessee’s RPI dropped from 47 to 50 after beating Missouri, a team that brought a 251 RPI to Thompson-Boling Arena. The Vols can help themselves this week, with a game Wednesday (TV: SEC Network, 6:30 p.m.) against Vanderbilt (14-13, 7-7), No. 49 in the RPI, and at No. 21 South Carolina (20-7, 10-4), No. 30 in the RPI, on Saturday. Tennessee travels to LSU (9-17, 1-13), No. 157 in the RPI, and hosts Alabama (16-10, 9-5), No. 74 in the RPI, to close the regular season next week. As of Monday morning, ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi's updated bracket had the Vols in the \"First Four Out\" category, along with Illinois State, Clemson and Wake Forest. “I like to think that we will win some more games but we are going to have to work hard to do it,” Barnes said. “We know where we want this program to be and we have to finish strong every year. “There are so many teams in the league that have four or five games left and are in a position to do some things and we are one of them. So we are going to see what we can do with it.” \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
