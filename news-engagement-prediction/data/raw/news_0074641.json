The series also fared badly in the late-night BBC1 repeats, where it was aired in four double bills.\nRead More Doctor Who fans rejoice: The Doctor is returning to our screens sooner than you might have thought Katherine Kelly as Miss Quill with Peter Capaldi's Doctor Who (Photo: BBC) The first episode got one million viewers, but by the end, that had dropped to 300,000 – way down on the slot average of 800,000.\nClass is the fourth TV spin-off from Doctor Who, following K9 and Company in 1981, and more recently Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures.\nClass was created by youth novelist Patrick Ness and featured a group of teens at Coal Hill School, where Clara Oswald ( Jenna Coleman ) was a teacher.\nClara Oswald, played by Jenna Coleman (Photo: BBC) But it failed to grip its target audience, who gave it a low appreciation rate of 70, compared to 82 for the Doctor Who Christmas Special.\nOne reviewer said: “Class is a bit like a hormonal teen – all over the place.”\nAnother moaned: “It’s just too bad it doesn’t live up to the hype.”\nA show source said: “Class hasn’t been the success the BBC were hoping for.”\nThe BBC said no decision on a recommission had been made.\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in Share this video Watch Next Celebs Newsletter Follow @MirrorTV Subscribe to our Celebs BBC1 Peter Capaldi Doctor Who Katherine Kelly", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorTV", "https://www.facebook.com/dailymirrortv", "https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201604/754/4221396001_4859437261001_4859304963001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/"], "published": "2017-02-23T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:29:20.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
