He had promised to leave a girl in Singapore \n“looking like the packaged meat you get from Safeway” supermarket when she rejected him. \nNow ten years later, on the anniversary of her daughter’s murder, Carly’s mother Sonya Ryan is using her own family tragedy to protect young girls from other online predators. Lured to her death with the cruellest of tricks, Carly Ryan (above), 15, was the victim of a sadistic but cunning online predator who had 200 fake internet profiles.

I am just desperately trying to make some kind of difference in her name.” \nCarly Ryan fell victim to Garry Newman’s “grossly perverted plan” to masquerade online as an 18-year-old musician named “Brandon Kane”. \nNewman, whose violent and barbaric history with women would only emerge later as he tried to evade prosecution, had 200 fake internet identities.

Garry Newman (above, centre) even hid behind his own son to shoulder blame for the murder of teenager Carly Ryan.

Both men were placed in custody in an Adelaide prison and their names suppressed. \nAt their 2009 trial, then 50-year-okld Preston allowed his then 18-year-old son — who was later acquitted — to carry the blame for Carly’s death. \nIn 2010, South Australian Supreme Court Justice Trish Kelly revealed Newman’s identity and sentenced him to life behind bars with a 29-year non-parole period. \n“It was a terribly cruel thing you did to this beautiful, impressionable 14-year-old child,” Justice Kelly said. \n“I say `child’ because that’s what she was — a child who fell in love with the idea of the handsome, musically inclined and rather exotic Brandon Kane. \n“The real man was an overweight, balding, middle-aged paedophile with sex and murder on his mind.” Following Garry Newman’s life sentence for Carly Ryan’s murder, his former wife ‘Christine” told how the violent sadist had ruined her life. Picture: News Corp. Source: News Limited \nAfter his conviction and sentence, Sonya Ryan said she would “never forgive the monster”. \n“I hope that he suffers, that he rots from the inside out, that he sees Carly’s face every morning and is haunted for the rest of his miserable life,” she said. \n“Thank God he can’t hurt another innocent child, but it’s frustrating that taxpayers will be paying for his (breakfast cereal) every morning. He had no right to take Carly’s life, and it hurts that he still has the luxury of breathing.” \nOn one occasion she wanted to go shopping with a female friend. When she told Newman she was going out, he grabbed her, beat her and dragged her into the bedroom. \nHe sat on her and punched her until she was barely conscious. She had crawled as far as the front door when Newman’s mother arrived and rang for a doctor. \nWhen the doctor asked if her husband was beating her, Newman held her hand so tightly he almost crushed her fingers as a warning to remain silent. \nSonya Ryan now dedicates her time to changing the justice system so it can protect innocent children from online predators. \nOn the Carly Ryan ten-year anniversary , supporters can buy a ‘Twibbon” to support her cause to fight cyber crime against children.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T13:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T10:24:40.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
