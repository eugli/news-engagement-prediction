(Jack Vartoogian/Getty Images/Getty Images) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  17 PM \nJazz guitarist Larry Coryell, known as the “Godfather of Fusion,” has died in New York City. \nHe was 73. \nHis publicist, Kurt Nishimura, said Coryell died Sunday in his hotel room of natural causes. \nNishimura says he had just performed two shows at the Iridium on Friday and Saturday. \nCoryell grew up in the Seattle area. After taking up the guitar, he moved to New York City in 1965. \nCoryell’s eclectic career includes collaborations with many of the jazz greats, including Miles Davis, Gary Burton, Alphonse Mouzon and Chet Baker. \nHis works often mixed jazz, classical and rock ingredients. \nIn 1969, he recorded “Spaces,” his most noted album. Many say it sparked the emergence of the jazz fusion movement. \nCoryell is survived by his wife, two daughters and two sons.
