The Trump issue was the catalyst.” \nIt was the toughest decision Gayle, who is now living in her own apartment in Washington, says she has ever had to make. \n“It took us many, many months to make this decision,” she says. “We went to counseling and saw a priest. This wasn’t a snap decision.” \nGayle, who met Bill in 1980 while they were both working at the same prison, says she felt like she had no voice in the relationship. \n“When things are 51 percent good and 49 percent bad, you just stay,” she says. “I was tired and older and I didn’t want to argue and neither of us was going to change.” \nWhen politics would come up, she’d usually walk away, she says. It was only when Trump came up that she knew she couldn’t stay silent. \n“I just couldn’t,” she says. “I was surprised Bill could agree with Donald Trump on anything.” \nAlthough Bill ended up not voting for Trump in the election, Gayle knew they still had to separate. \n“We are just too different,” she says. “It had more to do with the fact that I had not been true to myself for so long and that I had not stood up for myself for so long. I need to recapture myself. \n“It’s hard and not an easy thing,” she says. “I love him and I want him to be happy.” Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:49:34.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
