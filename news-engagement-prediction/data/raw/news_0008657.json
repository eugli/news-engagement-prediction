This may explain why he reportedly told the Australian prime minister that the conversation was 'the worst call by far' that day. Trump had earlier spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin, French President Francois Hollande, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. On Thursday afternoon the newly-elected president took to Twitter to slam the Obama administration for making the 'dumb deal' to take on 'thousands of illegal immigrants' Sources claimed President Trump was 'yelling' at Mr Turnbull during the conversation Trump was reportedly 'boasting' about his pleasant call with Putin when he told Turnbull the refugee agreement he struck with the Obama administration was the 'worst deal ever'. Speaking about the 1,250 the US was supposed to be allowing into the country from Manus Island and Nauru, Trump is reported to have said: 'I don't want these people.' He is also said to have complained that he was 'going to get killed' politically for following through on the resettlement agreement. Sky News sources claim President Trump was 'yelling' at Mr Turnbull at points during the heated conversation. Senior US officials told the Washington Post that Donald Trump abruptly hung up on Mr Turnbull after just 25 minutes - when the pair were meant to speak for an hour. Donald Trump slammed Malcolm Turnbull over the proposed asylum seeker deal during their first official telephone conversation (Pictured: Speaking to Malcolm Turnbull) What is the Australia-US refugee deal? The Obama administration and Turnbull government struck a deal to resettle some of the refugees being held offshore in Nauru and Manus Island in November last year The Australian government has a 'zero tolerance' policy towards illegal boat arrivals and only genuine refugees are sent to Nauru and Manus Island There are approximately 1,250 refugees being held in the Australian-funded offshore detention centres A large majority of those refugees come from Iran, Iraq and Somalia - all countries on US President Donald Trump's travel-ban President Trump reportedly agreed to honour the deal, on the condition the refugees would undergo 'extreme vetting' The US President reportedly described it as the 'worst deal ever' in a heated conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Sunday After Mr Turnbull apparently suggested they move on and talk about foreign affairs, including the conflict in Syria, President Trump ended the conversation. 'During call with Australian PM on refugees, Trump pulled phone away from ear and says he wants off call, which ends abruptly per source,' CNN reporter Jim Acosta tweeted. Trump later tweeted that the deal was 'dumb' and said he would be taking a second look at it. The explosive report is a huge embarrassment for Turnbull, who has insisted in recent days the asylum seeker deal is solid and relations with Washington are fine. 'It's better that these things - these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. If you see reports of them, I'm not going to add to them,' the prime minister said. Ross Cameron, a former minister for Turnbull's Liberal Party, said the leaked call could spell the end of his premiership, adding: 'He's finished.'
