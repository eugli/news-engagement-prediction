Nothing we want for the future is beyond our reach.\" The phrase should be \"too great.\"\nTwitter users quickly spotted the error over the weekend and the item was removed. An archived version of the listing is accessible through the Internet Archive website.\nThe marketing materials for the poster came from a third party vendor and the Library regrets not catching the mistake, said Library spokeswoman Gayle Osterberg.\n\"The item itself does not contain the error,\" she said.\nIt's at least the third high-profile spelling error from the government of late. The Education Department misspelled the name of W.E.B. DuBois on Twitter Sunday and mistyped again when apologizing for the error.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T14:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:38:18.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
