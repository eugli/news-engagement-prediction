The moves signal that Mr. Xiao, 45, is in serious trouble and that his companies are unlikely to be spared amid a widening crackdown. Companies under Mr. Xiao’s Tomorrow Group, which was founded in 1999, control tens of billions of dollars in assets, and its holdings have included stakes in more than 30 financial institutions, including Ping An, one of China’s biggest insurers, as well as Harbin Bank and Industrial Bank. His apparent abduction comes before an important Communist Party meeting expected to take place in October or November. There, the party will name as many as five new members to the elite Politburo Standing Committee, the group of seven men at the pinnacle of political power in China. In the months leading up to the conclave, held once every five years, the party puts stability at a premium, and Mr. Xiao, through his substantial holdings, is seen as having the potential to bring instability to China’s stock markets. Bill Bishop, who publishes the widely read Sinocism newsletter on Chinese politics, said that China’s leaders, including the president, Xi Jinping, and the Communist Party’s top antigraft enforcer, Wang Qishan, might see Mr. Xiao’s company as a “systemic threat to the stock market” in a year when stability is paramount. “It seems like a no-lose move for Wang and Xi,” Mr. Bishop said by email. One Hong Kong newspaper, the South China Morning Post, which is owned by the mainland’s Alibaba Group, said that Mr. Xiao was “ assisting investigations ” into China’s stock market gyrations in 2015. Shares in Shanghai climbed to highs in early June of that year, only to fall more than 40 percent in just over two months. Photo An undated photograph of Mr. Xiao in Beijing.

Credit The New York Times The full extent of Mr. Xiao’s wealth is not known. One person close to Mr. Xiao said his true wealth was many multiples more than the $5.8 billion in assets that the Shanghai-based Hurun Report, which tracks China’s wealthy, assigns to him . \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The clampdown at the borders illustrates the lengths China is willing to go to secure the man who long served as the de facto banker to the Chinese Communist Party elite. The case has also chilled Chinese and Hong Kong elites, as it demonstrates an increasing willingness by Chinese security forces to encroach into Hong Kong, which is supposed to run its own affairs. The employee currently detained by Hong Kong’s Immigration Department was stopped while trying to fly to Tokyo from Hong Kong International Airport on Sunday night, two people said. The man, Yao Long, worked in information technology at one of Mr. Xiao’s companies and had come to Hong Kong to work on strengthening the company’s cybersecurity within China, one person said.
