Enemy of the people is pretty far outside of what is the standard Republican playbook of attacking like Nick Confessore of The New York Times and other places.\nAnd, you know, there’s — administrations always take offense when they are criticized and challenged. But I think part of what you are seeing is bipartisan. And even inside the Trump administration itself it seems kind of beyond the pale\nJoe [Scarborough], my question for you is — I think most of the people at this table were alive, politically conscious, at the time of the Oklahoma City bombings. And every time that Donald Trump uses this kind of language I kind of worry that it’s an incitement to elements in our country that may go ahead and do something when the president of the United States calls the press the enemy of the people and they might take that seriously. Does that concern you?\n(h/t RCP Video )\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor\n Breitbart TV , Bloomberg , Donald Trump , John Heilemann , Morning Joe , MSNBC", "external_links": ["http://content.jwplatform.com/players/HVIBKEuq-EAYoNgFe.html", "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/02/20/heilemann_trumps_war_on_media_incitement_for_an_oklahoma_city_bombing.html", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fbloombergs-heilemann-likens-trump-anti-media-rhetoric-incitement-oklahoma-city-bombing%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Bloomberg%E2%80%99s+Heilemann+Likens+Trump+Anti-Media+Rhetoric+to+%E2%80%98Incitement%E2%80%99+of+the+Oklahoma+City+Bombing", "http://twitter.com/jeff_poor", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fbloombergs-heilemann-likens-trump-anti-media-rhetoric-incitement-oklahoma-city-bombing%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Bloomberg%E2%80%99s+Heilemann+Likens+Trump+Anti-Media+Rhetoric+to+%E2%80%98Incitement%E2%80%99+of+the+Oklahoma+City+Bombing&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fbloombergs-heilemann-likens-trump-anti-media-rhetoric-incitement-oklahoma-city-bombing%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Bloomberg%E2%80%99s+Heilemann+Likens+Trump+Anti-Media+Rhetoric+to+%E2%80%98Incitement%E2%80%99+of+the+Oklahoma+City+Bombing"], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T07:16:05.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
