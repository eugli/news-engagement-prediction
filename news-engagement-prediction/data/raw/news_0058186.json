A report on the matter is to be prepared by early spring. \nDuring a media teleconference on Friday the agency revealed that it intends to have initial findings out in a “pretty polished format” in a month’s time on how workable it is to add a crew to the Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1). The mission is meant to test the Space Launch System (SLS) / Orion Spacecraft combination in a moon flyby. © NASA \nThe decision to consider changing the Orion mission from unmanned to manned was announced earlier this month by Robert Lightfoot, NASA's acting administrator, at the request of the Trump administration. \nThe original mission was to launch an unmanned Orion craft around the moon and back in 2019 before launching a manned mission around 2021.

Its first test flight took place in 2014, but it used the Delta IV Heavy rocket rather than the Space Launch System as the launch vehicle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:12:31.488+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
