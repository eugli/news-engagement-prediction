We don’t know what he can remember because he can’t communicate. \n“We don’t know if he can remember what he did. \n\"Sometimes you will see something, a smile or a look but then it goes.” Billy McNeill was the first British player to life the European Cup (Photo: Getty images) \nBilly, 76, was diagnosed seven years ago, with no history of dementia in the family. \nThe family have never publicly spoken about it. \nBut as the 50th anniversary of his greatest triumph approaches, the McNeills have decided to bring their experiences into the open. Billy was diagnosed with dementia seven years ago (Photo: 2007 Getty Images) \nIt’s almost half a century since Billy became the first British player to hold aloft the European Cup after Celtic’s triumph over Inter Milan in Lisbon. \nIt has piqued interest from fans and well wishers in the welfare of the greatest captain the Scottish game has seen. \nThe family also want to back our sister title the Sunday Mail’s campaign on dementia in football. McNeill remains ones of the greatest captains in football history (Photo: SNS Group) \nThey are calling for more funding to further research links between the disease and heading a football – something the family wholeheartedly support. \nRecalling the journey towards Billy’s diagnosis, Liz said: “It was a bit of a shock, we didn’t really expect it. \n“I had noticed that Billy had been getting his words mixed up. He called the car the hoover one day, and I said to Mike Jackson, the best man at our wedding, had he noticed anything? \n“He said he had. So we talked to the family and went to see a doctor.” \nThe family had also noticed that he lost his way on a journey taking his grandchildren to school, a car trip he had done thousands of times. \nInitial tests revealed Billy had cognitive impairment and, after a series of further tests and a brain scan, a formal diagnosis of early onset dementia was confirmed. \nLiz and Billy were together when doctors delivered the news. Billy McNeill now barely remembers he was a giant of Scottish football (Photo: Collect Unknown) \nLiz said: “We didn’t talk about it, I didn’t want him to get upset or worried. In the beginning he would say, “What’s wrong with me?’ when he couldn’t do something or remember something. \n“I didn’t want to worry him. I’d say, ‘we all forget things, Billy’.” \nBilly’s voice disappeared a year-and-a- half ago. For a man whose life after the game was travelling the world and speaking about his incredible career, there is no doubt that has had a significant impact. \nLiz said: “Not being able to communicate with him is hard. He understands when you speak to him directly but only for a short time. He can’t concentrate. He can’t follow a conversation.” \nAnother symptom of the condition means that Billy sleeps a lot but is restless when awake and often unable to sit still for any period of time. Liz is unable to leave him alone. \nBut his close-knit family remain incredibly stoic. Liz said: “If this had happened to him when he was younger then I might feel different but he’s 77 in March and we have to accept it. We take it day by day. \n“One of the consultants described dementia as like riding a horse with the reins getting pulled and that’s what it is like. \n“It was a gradual thing. But while he is still able to walk and get about, I manage. \n“Celtic have been great as have the supporters and some of the old friends and players come and take him out. People like Pat Bonner, Andy Walker, Frank MacAvennie and Murdo McLeod come over.” \nLiz feels lucky that Billy still recognises the family and long standing friends. \nIn fact, he’s been known to push past people to get to a face he recognises from the past. And he’s very tactile, planting kisses on the cheeks of new people he’s meeting for the first time. \nAnd sometimes there are moments that can surprise even those closest to him. \nAt a Celtic pre-season match against Real Sociedad two years ago, a fan asked him for an autograph for his son with a message. \nBilly had not been able to sign anything for many months. \nBut after taking the pen, he wrote, “To Paul, Best Wishes, Billy McNeill”. \nAside from the dementia, Billy is in good health. Like most former footballers of his generation, his body has taken its fair share of knocks. He’s got a new hip and knee but a second knee operation was halted because doctors felt the recovery time would be too difficult. \nHe has lost weight but, according to Liz, he is still eating well and has not lost his sweet tooth. \nLiz said: “We are still doing things every day. Billy goes to bed very early and since we don’t have to get up for anything, I will sometimes leave him to lie in. \n“I help him get dressed, he can still do things for himself, he can tie his shoelaces but when we are trying to get out the door I help. \n“He can’t sit still for very long so I take him out, we go to the shopping centre and people still come up to him. I now tell them that he can’t speak because of the dementia. We never hid it. \n“Seven years ago, it was a family matter but I think the time is right to talk about it.” \nThat’s down to the fact that the family believe there may be a link to the years of heading heavy leather footballs in training and on the pitch. \nThe former centre half, who scored 37 goals in his Celtic career, mostly headers, is Scotland’s most famous footballer to be diagnosed with dementia. \nBut the family are not bitter or angry, just hopeful that in disclosing his condition more research can be done into why so many footballers seem to be suffering from the condition. \nAnd Billy is still a regular visitor to the directors’ box at Parkhead, where he is the club’s official ambassador, but now mainly at 3pm kick-offs. \nLiz said: “He knows Celtic Park and all the people there. \n“The chief executive, Peter Lawwell, has been great and Billy seems to enjoy being there– although we never stay long now.” \nLiz is caring for Billy herself with help from their five children, Susan, Paula, twins Libby and Carol, and Martyn. Billy’s eight grandchildren are all regular visitors too. \nEx-dancer Liz said: “Billy still plays football with the younger ones, although he obviously can’t kick the ball as he used to. He watches grandsons play football. \n“The older ones come round to see him and are great. He’s just grandad to them.” \nLiz decided last year to sell the large family home on the south side of Glasgow to move to a ground-floor flat. That meant having to clear a basement and an attic of thousands of photos and memorabilia. \nShe still hangs on to some of the most significant but was happy to make their life less complicated. \nBut their future, because of Billy’s dementia, is uncertain. \nThe family are hopeful that his legacy will still be his sporting achievements rather than the disease which has taken over the latter part of his life. \nGiven just what that legacy entails – a career so highly decorated that he unveiled his own statue outside Celtic Park – this will undoubtedly be the case. \nLiz said: “When people think of Jimmy Johnstone, they remember what he did on the pitch, not necessarily the fact that he had motor neurone disease. \n“Football has given us a great life. I know that if Billy could say anything, he wouldn’t change it.” \n● The McNeill family have asked for a donation to be made to Alzheimer’s Scotland. \nTo donate to Alzheimer Scotland please follow this link: www.alzscot.org/donate Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T11:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T06:57:12.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
