Advertisement \n<Credits: Yanie Dee> \nBismillah...Salaam everyone. It is with a heavy heart that I have to make this post. My dear father (Hj. Demon bin Hj. Salam) has been missing for more than 24 hours. He was last seen by my brother at the void deck of our West Coast home around 10.00am yesterday. \nHe is used to sitting at the void deck to chat to neighbours, but will usually find his way home shortly. He is 85 years old and has dementia. He was last seen wearing dark brown pants, a blue-ish batik shirt and his round white cap (similar to the one in pic). \nWe'd really appreciate it if y'all can help keep lookout for him. A police report has been made too. We can only pray for his safety and well-being right now. Jazaakallahu khayran kathiran for your time reading this. May Allah keeps my father safe and sound wherever he is right now. Aamiin ya Rabbal 'aalamin..
