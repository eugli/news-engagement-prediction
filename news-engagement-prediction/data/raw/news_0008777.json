Losing badly in Goa n Punjab, he tries to de-register the winning party 24 hrs before elections. Shameless dictator,\" he tweeted.\nThe AAP is fancying its chances in Punjab, where it is faced with a triangular contest with Congress and incumbent SAD-BJP combine. In Goa too, the AAP is hopeful of disturbing the ruling BJP's prospects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T13:34:27.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
