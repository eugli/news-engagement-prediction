TheStar!EmEZ's natural personality makes him a perfect radio personality. He transformed his deep love of radio/music at an early age, falling asleep listening to radio fueled his dreams. EmEZ was born in Brooklyn, New York and is of Hatian descent. In high school and college, EmEZ interviewed classmates on a regular basis, just for fun. This radio personality acted out his dream everyday with classmates and his dream materialized. EmEZ isn't here by chance. Interning at WKTU-FM for their street team would lead him to a job on Power 105.1's street team. Where at a station event a meeting with at the time the station's afternoon drive personality (2p-6p) Malikha Mallette would change his life. EmEZ's now mentor, Malikha Mallette, approached him and asked a question, \"What do you want to do wity your life?\" The answer was, \"I want to do what you do!\" The rest as they say is history. Working on Malikha's show was just the beginning! Malikha's show, The Ed Lover Morning Show, Dj Envy in the Afternoon, DJ Self on the weekends and now the Breakfast Club! You may not have heard of EmEZ but your favorite DJ has worked with him! You may not know him but he KNOWS YOU!
