Coffeeshops are not technically legal, but they are granted permits to trade Credit: ALAMY \nSupporters claim it is a step towards legalisation, which will make the cannabis industry more transparent and improve the quality and variety of the drug for consumers. \nThe legislation has yet to be approved by the upper house of the Dutch Parliament, but if it passes it could mark a turning point for the country’s coffeeshops, which have hitherto operated within a grey area of the law. I thought it was legal to smoke marijuana in Holland? \nNo. Despite the profusion of coffeeshops, which sell cannabis over the counter, the drug is not legal in the Netherlands. It is, however, tolerated, meaning the authorities will turn a blind eye to those in possession of 5g or less. \nCoffeeshops are allowed to store a maximum of 500g of cannabis on the premises at any one time. Growers have not generally in the past been prosecuted if they are cultivating five marijuana plants or less. So are coffeeshops illegal, then? \nThough coffeeshops are technically illegal, they are granted permits to trade by the authorities. Confused? You’re not the only one: Dutch drug law is a hazy old business. Mapped: The countries that smoke the most cannabis \nHowever, the rules are clear on one matter: coffeeshops are not allowed to buy cannabis. Many coffeeshop owners therefore employ third party buyers, who source the cannabis, no questions asked, and bring it into the shop. Once the weed is through the door, providing it amounts to no more than 500g, it is tolerated by the authorities. How will the new law affect coffeeshops? \nIf it becomes legal to cultivate marijuana, coffeeshops will no longer have to worry about employing buyers to sneak it through the back door for them. Essentially, the new law would make it cheaper, easier and safer to run a coffeeshop. \n“It would be a more transparent system,” said August de Loor, founder of the Bond Van Cannabis Detaillisten (BCD) union for coffeeshop owners. “The coffeeshop owner would be as normal as the owner of a pub.” How will the new law affect smokers? \nAs well as coffeeshop owners, the consumer would also potentially benefit from the proposed legislation. If passed the legislation could lead to cheaper, better quality cannabis Credit: ALAMY \n“The quality of the marijuana will get better, the variety will get better and the price will not be so high,” predicts de Loor. “In every way it is better.” I thought coffeeshops were closing? \nA government-backed scheme to shut down any coffeeshops within 250m of a school has resulted in many closures. The most high profile of which was Mellow Yellow, the oldest coffeeshop in Amsterdam – it closed on New Year’s Day . \nMellow Yellow is one of 28 establishments affected by the legislation , which the mayor’s office claimed would prevent young people from taking up smoking. Critics refuted this and questioned why pubs and bars were not subject to the same laws. A post shared by Gavin Haines (@gavin_haines) on Dec 4, 2016 at 11:44pm PST What about the Weed Pass, is that being enforced? \nThe so-called Weed Pass was designed to prohibit non-Dutch nationals from visiting coffeeshops. It was trialled in some of the country's southern provinces – including the city of Maastricht – but most towns and cities have reportedly abandoned the scheme. Amsterdam has been exempted from enforcing the Weed Pass on the condition that the mayor closes coffeeshops located within 250m of a school. However, coffeeshops in Maastricht still require smokers to prove they live in the Netherlands. How many coffeeshops are there in Amsterdam? \nToday just 175 coffeeshops remain in Amsterdam, half the number that existed in the Nineties. Amsterdam has more coffeeshops than any other city in the Netherlands, though Rotterdam, Utrecht and the Hague also have a handful to speak of. Mellow Yellow was Amsterdam's oldest coffeeshop, but it closed this year Credit: ALAMY How do you buy marijuana in the Netherlands? \nOver the counter and never off street dealers. Most coffeeshops have a weed menu, which gives information, usually in English, about the various strains they have available. Pre-rolled joints are usually available, if you don’t want to roll your own. Alcohol is not permitted in coffeeshops, though patrons can buy soft drinks, hot beverages and snacks.
