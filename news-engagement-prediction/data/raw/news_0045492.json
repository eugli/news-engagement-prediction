Why should a president create such tension for innocent people?” Moretta said.\nJust outside Los Angeles at Pomona College, which has a history of welcoming immigrants, undocumented students like 20-year-old Daniella Sada have been shielded from deportation by the Obama administration’s deferred action policy , or DACA, which the Trump White House has discussed changing.\n“I can honestly say I’ve never felt so much fear in my life as now,” Sada said.\n© Provided by CBS Interactive Inc. villarreal-la-immigrants-transfer.jpg She and her mother crossed the Mexican border illegally when she was just 1 year old. Her biggest fear is that her mother will be deported, leaving her alone to care for her two younger sisters.\n“I feel like it’s inevitable. Just saying when it happens, when ICE comes, when the raids happen and I have to go back to Mexico and I’m detained, this is what you are going to have to do,” Sada said.\nMoretta and his congregation are facing those same hardships, relying on faith and prayer to pull them through the frustration.\n“Still after all the rhetoric and all the debate we still do not have in congress a comprehensive immigration vote and that is the solution to a lot of these problems,” Moretta said.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dhs-sweeping-immigration-overhaul/?ftag=MSF0951a18", "http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/federal-agents-conduct-immigration-raids/?ftag=MSF0951a18", "http://www.cbsnews.com/?ftag=MSF0951a18", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/undocumented-students-daca-immigrants-fears-under-trump/?ftag=MSF0951a18", "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/mom-deported-mexico-phoenix-protests-lawyer/?ftag=MSF0951a18"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:34:47.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
