Canadian Immigration officers will escort him when he is deported.\nA Canadian immigration board decided Monday to extend Selva Kumar’s detention until he’s booted out of Canada.\nCanada Border Services Agency had earlier confirmed Selva Kumar was “under an enforceable deportation order,” but was not prepared to reveal his whereabouts.\nHe was convicted of drugging and sexually assaulting dozens of women in the late 1980s and early 1990s while posing as a modelling agent, movie producer and professional dancer.\nHe was convicted at two separate trials more than two decades ago of drugging and sexually assaulting 30 women.\nParole authorities refused to let him out early, as they feared the threat of him committing new offences was high. \n\n\nRelated story: \nSerial rapist heading back to Malaysia on Sunday", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:13:06.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
