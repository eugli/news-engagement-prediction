The red arrow points to when Starbucks announced its plan to hire 10,000 refugees. YouGov/Business Insider \nYouGov says that there’s reason to believe backlash will impact the chain’s bottom line. Two days before Starbucks’ announcement, 30% of consumers said they’d consider buying from Starbucks the next time they were craving coffee, the highest proportion in nearly a year. Now, the percentage is down to 24%, according to YouGov. \nWhile many customers were immediately supportive of Starbucks’ actions to support refugees, others threatened to boycott. \n“Upon hearing about your decision to hire 10000 refugees instead of Americans I will no longer spend any money at Starbucks,” one such Facebook user wrote on Starbucks’ page in late January. \nSome of this resentment seemed to be rooted in a belief that Starbucks was hiring refugees instead of veterans. Starbucks, however, does have a program in place to support veterans and their families, hiring 8,000 veterans and military spouses since 2014 — an initiative the chain has attempted to highlight in recent days and weeks online and on social media. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
