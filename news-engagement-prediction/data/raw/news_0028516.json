A previous FOIA request by Judicial Watch revealed that 28 DHS officials had at least sometimes used private, web-based email for official government work.\nIt isn't always illegal for federal employees to use private email. But maybe it's about time it should be. There are a lot of strict rules about it already that are violated routinely. The government has a legitimate interest in discouraging the practice, based on both the need to retain government records for FOIA requests and obviously the handling of classified information. Federal employees are already required to make any private emails about government business available for FOIA requests, but as Hillary Clinton 's sage showed, this is more theory than practice.\nAnd it isn't just about Clinton — in fact, it isn't a partisan issue, either. Other Cabinet officials in the Obama era were busted using private email, as were political employees in the Bush administration .\nLisa Jackson, an Environmental Protection Agency administrator, resigned after revelations about both her use of private email and a secret government email address under the pseudonym \"Richard Windsor.\" (The EPA spent at least three years resisting FOIA requests pertaining to the latter, at one point claiming that it would literally take a century to produce all the responsive records.) IRS officials embroiled in the 2013 targeting scandal were caught discussing by email their use of instant messaging software that doesn't preserve their communications for FOIA.\nCongress has a lot on its plate right now, as does President Trump . But it might be a good time to discuss new, government-wide standards for communication between federal employees about government business. It's obviously become a real problem, and the current ambiguous \"honor-system\" rules just aren't being honored.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Ivanka Trump causes stir by sitting at the president's desk Ivanka Trump posed sitting at the Oval Office desk with U.S. and Canadian leaders beside her.\nBy Anna Giaritelli • 02/14/17 5:25 PM  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:42:17.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
