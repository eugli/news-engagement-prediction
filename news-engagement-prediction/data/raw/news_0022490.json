Apparently Donald Trump thought Japanese prime minister ShinzĹ Abe didn't, even through he's actually been there twice before. Trump greeted Abe Friday morning for the Japanese PM's official visit and, predictably, made a gaffe that took over social media in a matter of minutes. Now the \"very famous White House\" memes and jokes are completely swallowing Trump's news cycle, and it's amazing. \nAbe and Trump spent the morning together before arriving at the White House, at which time Trump delivered his now already infamous line. \"Prime Minister Abe, on behalf of the American people, I welcome you to the very famous White House,\" Trump said, to the groans of millions of Americans who still can't believe this guy is the president. Once again, Trump's pathological urge to assert his dominance has made him a laughing stock. Trump's daily face-palm moment is especially embarrassing this time because it's a complete affront to Japanese culture , which values modesty and humility. At least it happened on Trump's turf, because it might have been a serious political nightmare if Trump had said something along those lines while visiting Japan. \nThe jokes in response to Trump's screw-up are hilarious, but just remember, don't get too distracted by little things like this that he does. It's a nice little humorous break from political reality, but it doesn't matter in the long run. Trump is a lot more dangerous than he sometimes gets credit for, and people still need to treat him like the threat that he is. Read through these awesome \"very famous White House\" jokes, then get right back to kicking Trump out of there. It's Not A Roadside Diner, Dude \"Welcome you to the very famous White House\" #wtf Is there a Tues night all you can eat special? #Pressconference Source: lanny r shay on Twitter Does He Even Read The Briefing Materials? He doesn't seem to understand that Prime Minister Abe has visited the very famous White House before. https://t.co/aDWykHxPrO ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:21:57.300+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
