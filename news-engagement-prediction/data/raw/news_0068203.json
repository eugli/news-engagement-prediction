Almost every single room had been converted for the wholesale production of cannabis plants, and there was a large amount of evidence of previous crops. This was an enormous set up.\" â€“ Detective Inspector Paul Franklin, Dedicated Crime Team Last updated Thu 23 Feb 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:19:09.019+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
