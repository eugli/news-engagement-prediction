(Photo: Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nVirginia denied North Carolina its bid to claim the outright ACC regular-season title on Monday. \nAt least for the time being. \nThe No. 23 Cavaliers managed to slow the No. 5 Tar Heels offense throughout the game on the way to a 53-43 victory at John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville, Va. North Carolina (25-6, 13-4 ACC) shot less than 40% from the field and was held to its lowest point total of the season. \nThe Cavaliers (20-9, 10-7) have won two in a row after struggling through a four-game losing streak, and they ended North Carolina's four-game winning streak. \nNorth Carolina closes out its regular season on Saturday at home against Duke. Virginia hosts Pittsburgh on Saturday. NEVER MISS OUT Sports Stay in the know and in the zone, 7 days a week, with scores, analysis, and in-depth features and commentary.
