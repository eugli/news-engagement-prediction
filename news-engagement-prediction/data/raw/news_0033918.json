The confirmation of Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II is being opposed by Senator Antonio Trillanes IV. Rappler photo \nMANILA, Philippines – Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II on Wednesday, February 15, denied giving special treatment to high-profile inmates who testified against Senator Leila de Lima at a congressional inquiry, calling the confidential Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) memorandum as \"hearsay.\" \nAguirre made the statement at the resumption of his confirmation hearing on Wednesday. The allegation was part of the opposition filed by Senate Antonio Trillanes IV against him before the Commission on Appointments (CA). \nIn his opposition, Trillanes cited the memo which stated that Aguirre allowed the special treatment of inmates at the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) custodial center. \nAt least 8 inmates, including convicted armed robber and drug dealer Herbert Colanggo , were transferred to the detention center in September 2016, to ensure their safety prior to their testimonies at the House probe into the drug trade at the New Bilibid Prison when De Lima was justice chief. \nAguirre denied the contents of the memo, dismissing what was written by BuCor chief legal officer Alvin Herrera Lim as nothing but \"hearsay.\" \n“There’s no proof that there were electronic gadgets, smart television sets, airconditioning unite, Internet, cellular phones. These are all hearsay because Attorney Lim did not see this,” Aguirre said. \nHe even said that Trillanes’ opposition is “double hearsay” because it was only based on Lim’s statement. \nAguirre asserted this even after the AFP chief himself, General Eduardo Año, confirmed days earlier that there were “unauthorized fixtures” in cells of the inmates, similar to what the BuCor memo said. \n“ Alam mo sa amin sa Armed Forces, meron kaming tinatawag na (You know, we in the Armed Forces have what we call) security survey and inspection. This is done periodically to ensure that all facilities are safe from any espionage or any security compromise,” Año said in an interview with reporters on February 9. \n“ So ‘yung portion na ‘yun as (So that portion, as) part of our job, we made some observations and investigations and inspection and the appropriate measure or course of action will be through the proper authority like the Bureau of Corrections and the Department of Justice and we believe they have made appropriate actions already,” he added. \nAño was apparently referring to Aguirre's February 8 order for BuCor chief Benjamin delos Santos to \"investigate and verify\" the reported privileges, and to confiscate and dismantle them, if true. This came two months after Delos Santos supposedly raised the matter to Aguirre himself. (READ: FACT CHECK: Did Aguirre reward inmates who testified vs De Lima? ) \nAguirre hits Lim's credibility \nTo further push his point, Aguirre also cast doubt on the credibility of Lim. \nHe claimed the lawyer was found guilty of “grave misconduct” twice. There was no proof presented. \n“ Si Lim po , I never met this person. A mutual friend said he wanted to rectify his statement and he is crying. Up to now, he is not going to the office, about one week already. And based on records of Attorney Lim, he was charged with grave misconduct and other charges; he was found guilty. The second one, he was charged again with grave misconduct,\" he said. \nAguirre also claimed Lim has a pending case for practicing law in Lucena City “ without authority from the Secretary of Justice .\" \nAs of posting, the CA held an executive session to discuss the BuCor issue involving Aguirre, as well as Trillanes’ request to subpoena Lim and the chief of the AFP custodial center. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?
