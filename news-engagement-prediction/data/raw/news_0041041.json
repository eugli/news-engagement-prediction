Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Roy Keane has slammed Arsenal 's performance against Bayern Munich and claimed the Gunners 'only have two decent players'.\nThe former Manchester United midfielder was speaking on ITV's Champions League Highlights show after the north Londoner's suffered a humiliating 5-1 loss to the Bundesliga champions.\nArsene Wenger's side conceded four second half goals meaning they're all but certain to exit the Champions League at the last 16 stage for a seventh straight season.\nAfter going one-nil down, thanks to a superb strike from Arjen Robben, Arsenal appeared to get themselves back into the game through Alexis Sanchez.\n(Photo: Bongarts) The Chilean scored from a rebound after initially missing from the penalty spot.\nBut if the Gunners were motivated by heading into half-time at 1-1, it didn't show in the second 45.\nRobert Lewandowski scored eight minutes after the restart, and Thiago made it 3-1 six minutes after that.\n(Photo: Bongarts) The capitulation continued when the Spaniard doubled his tally seven minutes later and almost certainly ended the tie.\nSubstitute Thomas Muller then added insult to injury in the 88th minute by making it five.\n\"I'm not surprised,\" Keane said. \"Did you think they'd go to Bayern Munich and get a result?\n(Photo: David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images) \"We've said it before, though. Lack of leaders, lack of characters, hunger, desire.\n\"But I have to say, tonight at this level, this stage of the competition, they're just not good enough.\n\"So there's no point in being too critical of them, because they're not good enough.\n\"They've only got two decent players. The rest, average.\"\nKeane also hit out at stand-in captain Kieran Gibbs: \"When I see Gibbs with the captain's armband on at the end of the game, you're in trouble.\"\nRead More Bayern Munich 5-1 Arsenal 5 things we learned as Gunners collapse Player ratings from the Allianz Arena DUNN: How much more can Wenger take?
