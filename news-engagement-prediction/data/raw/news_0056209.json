Amazon \nAfter consuming the alcohol, Megan came home because she wasn’t feeling well. Her mother, Joanne, claimed she was supposed to stay over her friend’s house for the night, but had to take care of her when she got back. \nJoanne was unaware of the amount of alcohol her daughter drank at the party. \nShe told Mirror, \nShe was still texting her friends Happy New Year, and I went up to bed with her to make sure she was settled.

Facebook \nThe 16-year-old was a victim of pulmonary aspiration, which occurred when the liquids in her stomach emptied into her lungs, causing her to “dry drown.” \nSince her daughter’s death three years ago, Joanne has made it her life mission to change the laws concerning cheap alcohol, hoping to inform young people of the dangers that surround dangerously accessible and affordable alcohol. \nShe said, \nTeenagers and young adults need to know how dangerous it can be. You see them buying it or looking for it in corner shops. It has been going on for generations. Under 18s are not supposed to buy it, but they do get their hands on it and it is so dangerous. Frosty Jack’s \nJoanne has been invited to speak at the House of Commons on Thursday, February 23 in attempt to change the laws surrounding the purchasing of cheap alcohol. \nSince her efforts began, Frosty Jack’s sent her family their condolences and agreed to work toward a solution to the reoccurring issue of underage alcohol purchasing. \nThe company stated, \nWe’re ready and willing to work with all interested parties to seek effective solutions to what is often a complex problem.
