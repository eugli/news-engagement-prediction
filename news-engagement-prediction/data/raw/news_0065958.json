If it is not managed well, the jobs created will be lost, a situation that the government does not want to happen during the current economic conditions,\" Bernama quoted Johari ( photo ) as saying. \nEarlier yesterday, former prime minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad warned that selling off the controlling stake in national carmaker Proton to foreigners would not be beneficial for the country. warned \n\"My fear is that if we do not own Proton any more the Malaysian automotive industry will suffer a great loss. \n\"The vendors and suppliers of components will close shop. Lots of workers will lose their jobs. And Malaysiaâ€™s engineering capacity will be reduced,\" Mahathir wrote on his blog. \nConsequently, he said, Malaysia would not be a developed country by 2020 or even later, and that Malaysia would remain a Third World developing country. \nMahathir, who was Proton's adviser after stepping down as prime minister in 2003 until 2016, said he was sad that the firm now had to be sold to foreigners. \n\"Having a strategic partner is okay. But once Proton is sold to foreigners it will cease to be a national car. \nOn Feb 10, Johari was reported as saying that the government has no issue over DRB-Hicom Bhd relinquishing its 51 percent stake in Proton Holdings Bhd to pursue a foreign strategic partnership (FSP). \nJohari said it was better for a Malaysian origin car to become a well-known international brand, rather than stay domestic and sell between 200,000 and 300,000 units, which is not sustainable. \n\"The key is to bring many investors to Malaysia and create employment,\" Johari told reporters at the Malaysian Retail Chain Association Chinese New Year celebration. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:24:19.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
