He had to wear the star. I don't particularly want it painted on homes.\"\nSeattle Rabbi Daniel Weiner believes these are unabated incidences following into a nationwide trend.\n\"It's also worrisome as a reflection of larger trends that are happening in this country. Particularly the ways in which people who are thought to be on the margins, have been increasingly discriminated against and made to feel fearful. And I think this is in many ways a piece of those larger concerns.\"\nThe FBI and the Justice Department are investigating a series of bomb threats directed at more than 50 Jewish Community Centers in 27 states, according to the JCCA, an association of Jewish Community Centers. In addition, this weekend vandals damaged more than 100 headstones at a Philadelphia Jewish cemetery, less than a week after a similar incident in St. Louis.\n\"I think it's a time to be concerned as a member of any minority group within this country,\" added Rabbi Weiner.\nOn Friday, Vice President Mike Pence condemned these recent acts.\n\"Let me be clear – we condemn these vile acts and those who perpetuated them in the strongest possible terms. Hatred and anti-Semitism have no place in America.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:02:29.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
