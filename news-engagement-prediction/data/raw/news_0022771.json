Yesterday, I retweeted a post without first checking who had posted it. An error on my part which I regret. \n“When I found out who had originally posted the tweet, I made my thoughts on that person clear, on Twitter, and then I blocked him/her. By that time people with a vastly different agenda to mine appeared to have decided that they want to make mischief of my error.”\nHe later tweeted that he objected to “Rothschild and co” because of their “greed, monopolistic exploitations and unchecked power”.\nThe Rothschild family descended from a wealthy 18th century German-Jewish financier, Meyer Amschel Rothschild, and went on to become of the richest families in the world. \nThey have since been the target of many unfounded conspiracy theories – many of which are anti-Semitic in nature. \nMr Clarke’s comments have reignited the controversy over anti-Semitism within the Labour party which has plagued leader Jeremy Corbyn over the past year. \nThe party was forced to confront a series of incidents last year including remarks made by members on Twitter and at public meetings.\nFormer London Mayor Ken Livingstone was suspended by the party after he made remarks suggesting Hitler supported Zionism. \nUK news in pictures 14 show all UK news in pictures 1/14 7 February 2017 A bus drives past a mural depicting US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May, in London\nReuters\n2/14 7 February 2017 Claire Blackman, the wife of imprisoned marine Alexander Blackman arrives for the first day of his appeal hearing at Royal Courts of Justice\nGetty Images\n3/14 2 February 2017 The final deck piece of the Queensferry Crossing over the Firth of Forth, sits on a barge ahead of it being lifted into position.
