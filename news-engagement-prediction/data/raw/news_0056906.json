It wasn’t good week for abortion rights. \nRoe, whose real name was Norma McCorvey, is, of course, the famous plaintiff in Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion in 1973. The broken glass is now part of the massive effort to undo that ruling (in this case, when Texas Senator Charles Schwertner tried to silence a student speaking against yet a new batch of anti-abortion legislation—and thrust his gavel so hard it cracked the table.) Since 2010, states have enacted 338 restrictions on abortion—50 in just the last year, at a pace that is sure to gain speed under the new administration. And the restrictions are getting bolder, like banning the most common procedure for second-trimester abortions and mandating burials for abortion tissue; Oklahoma even advanced a bill that would require written consent from the man involved. \nThis is why a new study of abortion on TV is so timely. Published in the journal Feminism & Psychology , it analyzed 89 plot lines from 2005 to 2015 and found that in TV land, an abortion is a pretty easy thing to get. On dramas and sitcoms, you rarely see women facing obstacles posed by the growing legal restrictions. That holds for 2016 as well, according to coauthor Gretchen Sisson, Ph.D., 32, a sociologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has been tracking abortion onscreen for four years. It's true that many of the shows are set in places like New York City or Los Angeles, where there is fairly good access to abortion care. Sisson is concerned that viewers won’t realize how dangerous the state laws are in much of the country, where women have to wait before getting the procedure, sometimes drive hundreds of miles to see a provider, and where DIY abortions are a real thing. “We know that general public knowledge of abortion restrictions and their impacts is very low,\" she says. \"And this is a missed opportunity for TV to correct that.” \nTo be fair, portraying abortion in a medium meant to entertain is a tricky dance. And women TV writers—thank you Shonda Rhimes and all the others who wrote 9 of the 13 episodes Sisson tracked last year—deserve mega love because especially in the last year, they have busted some tired old tropes. \nOn Crazy Ex-Girlfriend we only learn why Paula is snuggled in bed awaiting pizza delivery when the doorbell rings and we hear her son yell from below, “I’ll get it since you just had an abortion.” We can't be happier to see the abortion narrative released from the “agonizing over the decision” arc to include women handling the procedure like other “difficult but manageable and now-we-can-move-on” events. \nOn Jane the Virgin, when Alba discovers her daughter Xiomara had a medical abortion, she’s beside herself. Although she’d previously told Xo it was okay, now she believes abortion is a sin (as did Jane Roe later in life). The two struggle to make peace with it as Xo's own daughter, Jane, supports her, and ultimately Alba accepts the decision. Major points here for portraying a starring Latina character getting an abortion, and a medical abortion at that (although more than a third of women who terminate in the first nine weeks choose this method, it's rarely mentioned onscreen.) Also, says Sisson,\"Xiomara is only the second grandmother to get one on TV. The first was Maude in 1972!\" \nBojack Horseman goes where few have been. In the animated comedy, when social media manager Diane needs an abortion, she accidentally tweets out that it’s her client who's getting one. That would be Sextina Aquafina (played as a rockstar dolphin) who decides, hey, great opportunity! She’ll take her fake news and pretend she is getting an abortion to garner buzz; then drops a new single, \"Get That Fetus, Kill That Fetus” with lyrics ripped from a pro-life playbook. As only humor can, the show pokes at the absurdity of the polarized debate as it tries to pry away a little stigma. “It's so over the top,\" says Sisson. \"But we’re seeing more comedic portrayals and I think that's good. Abortions can be hard, and humor can make the experience a little easier and less isolating.\" And you can't talk about comedy without nodding to John Oliver who, in one of his best moments ever, did actually take on abortion restrictions. If you missed it, you just have to watch . \nSo what do we want to see in 2017? Here are a few thoughts from women who have been in the trenches. \nTracy Droz Tragos, who directed the HBO documentary Abortion: Stories Women Tell , suggests that scripted shows go to places like North Dakota, Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas \"where women’s access to affordable healthcare is never easy and sometimes is nonexistent,\" she says. \"I think it's time to tell some of the really tough stories, stories of women who simply give up. What are the implications when women are unable to finish school, to find work, to hold jobs, to move out of poverty, to escape abusive relationships, to continue living in communities where they are shunned—and are desperate enough to take matters into their own hands.\" \n\"I'd love to see characters who better mirror our patients,\" says Julie Burkhart, founder and CEO of Trust Women Foundation, which operates Trust Women South Wind Women’s Center clinics in Wichita, Kansas, and Oklahoma City. \"These women often scramble to borrow money. Some have to drive hours to see us. About 70 percent are mothers simply are trying to make the best decision for the children they already have, and they must endure protesters who pressure them to reconsider. In Wichita, there is only one cab company that will bring patients to our clinic. This is what abortion is like in our part of the country.\" \n\"It's great to see storylines about abortion—that's real progress,\" says Dawn Porter, director of the abortion documentary Trapped , \"but I'd like to see more of what's true for so many women: the long waits because there are so few doctors, forced ultrasounds and medically unnecessary multiple appointments so she can 'think it over,' requirements that they hear medically incorrect information such as abortion causes breast cancer. The truth is, in more than half the states in America, a woman seeking an abortion is in for a nasty surprise at how many obstacles she will confront before she can make her choice.\" \nHollywood, we'll be watching what you do next.
