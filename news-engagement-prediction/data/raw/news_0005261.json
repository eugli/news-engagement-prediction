Photo: Dave Martin, STF Johnny Manziel sells autographs and selfies with fans at Katy Mills Mall 1 / 1 \nJohnny Football was back. \nAt the Katy outlet mall. \nThirty miles from the heart of Super Bowl LI in Houston, the fallen former Texas A&M star quarterback set up shop Thursday night inside a sports memorabilia store. \nThere were Heisman Trophy replicas selling for $375 apiece. It was $99 for an autograph ticket or a photo op (Manziel's signature not included), $50 for a selfie ticket (with your own camera) and $29 got you a personal inscription (four words maximum). \nIt was by far one of the oddest and most surreal of Manziel's post-NFL moments. While Houston reveled in Super Bowl week about 100 miles from Manziel's college home at College Station, one of the game's biggest amateur stars sold autographs and photos of himself at a suburban mall. \nListing the highlights of Manziel's fall from grace would take too long; the craziest have become embedded within pop-sports culture. But the 2014 first-round pick recently declared that he's sober and Thursday was his first advertised regional appearance in years. \nDespite only spending two controversy-plagued seasons with Cleveland and being out of the NFL last season, the 24-year-old QB still has supporters who believe in him and are waiting for his return to the field. \n\"He's a good kid. I just think he steered off the wrong path. But I think he can get right back on,\" said Tim Foteh, a Sugar Land resident carrying a limited-edition Aggies helmet from Manziel's freshman year.
