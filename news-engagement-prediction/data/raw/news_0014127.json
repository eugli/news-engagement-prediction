(PTI ) \nThe BJP on Saturday released its vision document for Uttarakhand which promises a slew of freebies for the education sector including distribution of free laptops and smartphones among meritorious students besides giving a boost to health facilities and making them available to every section of society. \nThe state will go to polls on February 15. \nReleasing the vision document, senior BJPleader Arun Jaitley said the party is proud of documenting its vision for the development of a state which it created during its last stint in power at the Centre. \n“It is a proud moment for BJP to spell out its vision for a state which acquired statehood under NDA as the fulfilment of the long cherished aspiration of the people living in this region,” Jaitley said. \nHe said the document which envisions clean governance for Uttarakhand is in sync with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s commitment for accelerating the country along the highway of growth.
