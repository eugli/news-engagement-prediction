Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!\" \nEvery sitting president since 1924 has attended the dinner at least once. I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 25, 2017 \nMr Trump’s announcement came the day after the White House barred news organisations, including UK publications, from an informal press briefing, as Mr Trump denounced the media as the “enemy of people”. \nUK media outlets including the BBC, The Guardian and The Daily Mail were blocked from the off-camera Friday briefing held by press secretary Sean Spicer, in a move that has angered supporters of a free press’s role in a democracy. \nCNN, Buzzfeed and The New York Times, of which Mr Trump has been highly critical, were also denied access. \nThe decision to exclude certain media outlets came after a Mr Trump made a speech in which he blasted the media describing negative news coverage as “fake news”. \nThe event, which is due to be held on April 29, is normally a light-hearted affair in which the president makes a humourous speech. \nFormer President Barack Obama attended the dinner eight times. White House bars news organisations from press briefing \nMajor news outlets including Bloomberg News and the New Yorker magazine have said they will not hold their regular after-parties this year. \nThe New York Times has said it will respond to Mr Trump's attacks on the media by broadcasting an advertisement called The Truth Is Hard during Sunday's Oscars. \nThe 30-second video to air during the Academy Awards will close with the words: \"The truth is hard. The truth is hard to find. The truth is hard to know. The truth is more important now than ever.\" More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:00:14.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
