Lingard picks Man Utd 5-a-side team \nThe young Englishman, who opted not to include himself, said, via Goal : “At the back, I’d pick Daley (Blind). I think you need a player at the back who is going to be composed and assured on the ball. Article continues below Marcelo abused for not wishing Cristiano happy birthday - reacts brilliantly \n\"Midfielder? I’d say Pogba. You need that bit of flair in midfield. I’ll say Ander (Herrera) as well, he’s got a bit of bite to him and you need that energy and aggression.\" \nRegarding his goalkeeper and striker, Lingard continued: \"Marcus Rashford up front. He’s got the skills up top to beat a player and score. In net, obviously David de Gea.” The huge names Lingard left out \nIt was no surprise to see the world-class De Gea and Lingard's good friend Pogba in his side, however, as already mentioned, he left out a wealth of talent from United's star-studded squad. \nThe biggest omissions have to be Wayne Rooney, now United and England's all-time leading goalscorer, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has proved to all his doubters that he can cut in the Premier League and remains as good as ever at the ripe old age of 35. \nRooney is Lingard's captain at both club and international level, while Ibrahimovic has registered 19 goals this season, 12 more than United's joint-second top scorers; Pogba and Juan Mata. \nJose Mourinho spent close to £60 million in total on Eric Bailly and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, but that duo also miss out, as do classy technicians like Mata and Michael Carrick, with Lingard favouring composure at the back and youth in attack. \nDo YOU agree with Lingard?
