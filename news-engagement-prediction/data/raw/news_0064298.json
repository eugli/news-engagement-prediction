half-brother Kim Jong-nam. \nThe airline’s office here hit the spotlight after inspector-general of police (IGP) Khalid Abu Bakar confirmed his men were looking for an employee with Air Koryo in relation to the high profile case. \nAn employee of a virtual office hosting Air Koryo’s representative office at Jalan Ampang, however, refused to divulge information about the airline, The Star reported. \n“No, it’s not here,” the male staff member at the reception area said, then \nshrugged and immediately shut the door when asked about Air Koryo yesterday. \nIt is learnt that the virtual office host, Worldwide Highsky Sdn Bhd, had also taken off the Air Koryo sign, despite the airline being listed on a wall panel as one of 24 companies that the company services. \nIt could not be determined, however, whether the removal was done under the instruction of the airline representative or by the virtual office itself to avoid further media enquiries, reported The Star . \nThe English daily said when media practitioners approached employees there, they gave a standard reply of “no comment” when asked about Air Koryo. \nAnd when a broadcast journalist from South Korea started shooting videos of \nthe office, two receptionists working there fled at once. \nTwo security guards and a cleaner approached said they had never seen any \nNorth Korean airline employee around. \nApart from the said Air Koryo employee, Khalid yesterday said the other suspect wanted for investigation into Jong-nam’s murder was the second secretary at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur. \nMP: Issue travel warning \nMeanwhile, commenting on the current diplomatic tension between North Korea and Malaysia, DAP lawmaker Lim Lip Eng said it was time for the Foreign Ministry to advise Malaysians from going to North Korea at the present moment. \nCiting the case of four Malaysian women who were reportedly abducted by North Korea and were reported to be last seen in Pyongyang in 1978, Lim said it is the government’s duty to remind the people of the incident. \n“The foreign minister’s most important job now is to ensure that no Malaysian is abducted or suddenly disappears while investigations into Jong-nam’s murder is carried out. \n“The Malaysian government must take necessary measures to avoid any unwanted reaction from North Korea which can affect the country’s peace and the safety of Malaysians,” he said in a statement. \nOn Feb 13, Jong-nam was at KL International Airport 2 (KLIA2) at approximately 8am for a flight to Macau, when a woman came from behind and wiped his face with her bare hands, believed to be sprayed with poison. \nJong-nam, who arrived in Malaysia from Macau on Feb 6, sought medical help at a customer service counter and was rushed to Putrajaya Hospital, but died on the way. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published":
