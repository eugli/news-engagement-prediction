From deep inside, this might look like one of those “battle for the soul of the party” events we always hear about. But it isn’t.\nIn fact, there’s a remarkable level of agreement between the candidates, and the winner’s biggest job will be not to get too much in the way of a wave of activism that is rising from the grassroots. As long as they don’t screw it up, this could be a transformative moment for the Democratic Party.\nIt’s not exactly clear where the race for party chair stands at the moment, but it’s a close contest between the two leading candidates: Tom Perez, the former Secretary of Labor in the Obama administration, and Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota. Despite the efforts of some to turn the race into a proxy battle between the “establishment” (supposedly represented by Perez) and the grassroots (supposedly represented by Ellison), the truth is that this is no battle for the soul of the Democratic Party. While there are legitimate reasons one might prefer Ellison to Perez or vice-versa, almost everyone who knows anything about the two of them acknowledges that they’re both smart, competent, progressive leaders and either one would likely do an excellent job as party chair.\nThey’ve also both been saying pretty much the same things as they make their cases: that the party needs to focus on rebuilding itself at the state and local level, get back into communities where it has been absent in recent years, and make an unapologetic case for progressive ideals. And while whoever wins is certainly going to go on TV a lot, when your party is out of power, the job of the chair is primarily an organizational one. It’s about constructing and managing the infrastructure it will be able to activate in future elections.\nRight now Perez may have a small advantage. Some Democratic strategists tracking the race say he has 205 votes in hand, slightly more than Ellison. On the other hand, Politico’s email survey of voting members found Ellison with a slight lead, although only 40 percent of the members responded. It’s hard to know what will happen, because under the DNC’s system, if no candidate gets 50 percent on the first ballot, they vote again, and if everyone still falls short, repeated votes are taken with the last-place finisher in each round dropping off for the next round (there are eight candidates in total). So it’s possible the person who starts out in second place (or even third or fourth) could win.\nIn short, we have no idea how the vote will turn out. But what’s more important is this: whoever wins will almost inevitably preside over a period of rebirth for the Democratic Party, thanks to Donald Trump.\nWhen George W. Bush was still president, I wrote a book with advice for liberals. Whenever I spoke about it, someone would inevitably ask, “What should progressives like us do ?” My response was always this: If you think the Democratic Party isn’t doing its job, take it over. Find your local Democratic committee and join up. Bring three of your friends. Then you can start moving it in the direction you want.\nNow that seems to be happening all over — except that people aren’t bringing three of their friends, they’re bringing 30 or 300. As Ryan Grim and Amanda Terkel reported earlier this week, state and local Democratic Party organizations have been inundated with people wanting to get involved:\nAll across the country, party meetings that had once been sleepy affairs, dominated by Robert’s Rules of Order and a handful of graying activists, have become standing room only. The overflowing crowds have sent stunned party regulars scrambling to find new venues, while the surge in interest, and the coinciding fundraising boost, is enabling local chapters to hire staff and build infrastructure in previously unthinkable ways. On the national level, Democratic politicians have been rushing to respond to the sudden outpouring.\n“I’m as busy this year as I was at any time last year in the heat of a huge election,” said Mark Fraley, chairman of the Monroe County Democratic Party in Indiana.\nFraley said he received 65 emails in a single weekend from people requesting to become precinct chairs, a thankless job that normally requires begging and pleading to get someone to fill. The county party has restructured and added five deputy chairs to channel all the energy, and created six new committees.\nOf course, it’s possible that all that energy will fizzle out, and one of the DNC chair’s most critical tasks will be to make sure it doesn’t, by finding ways to keep those newly energized activists engaged and motivated. But the most encouraging thing from the party’s perspective is that while the resistance to Trump and the Republican Congress is manifesting itself in protests and town hall meetings — organized independently and on short notice, with the help of new groups that are cropping up — there also appear to be large numbers of people who see the Democratic Party as one of the essential vehicles for their activism.\nAnd that’s as it should be. As vital as that outside organizing is, if it’s going to maximize its impact it needs an electoral component. If your goal is stopping the GOP from doing too much damage, there aren’t too many better ways to do it than voting them out of office, both on the state level and in Congress. While there are certainly some liberals who think the Democratic Party is hopelessly corrupt and the only true path to change lies outside it, right now there seems to be no shortage of people who want to use the party to fight Trump.\nWhich means that the next DNC chair is being given an army. We’ll see if he can figure out how to use it.\nopinions\nplum-line\nOrlando Shooting Updates\nNews and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.\npost_newsletter348\nfollow-orlando\ntrue\nafter3th\nfalse\nPlease provide a valid email address.\nSign up You’re all set!
