It definitely showed and I think I out-worked him,” said Rynn, who was named the outstanding lightweight wrestler after winning the SnOverlea Invitational at Overlea on Saturday. “Jimmy is a tough wrestler so I just had to make sure I was mentally prepared for it.” \nMt. Hebron missed a chance for a bonus point at 152 pounds, as Ali Pender got Oakland Mills’ James Pender on his back in the final seconds but couldn’t secure the three-point near fall and had to settle for a 14-0 major decision. \nThe Scorpions responded and built their lead to 20-4 after major-decision victories from Anthony Morales (160) and Paul Johnson (182) and a pin from Mulbah Kamara (170). Johnson picked up three near-fall points in the final 10 seconds to earn major decision and the extra team point. \nThe Vikings, however, weren’t out of it yet. Shaber Ahmad (195) and heavyweight Nick Nordhausen earned a pair of decisions between a pin from Isa Pender (220) in a back-and-forth battle to cut the deficit to four, but Oakland Mills got a forfeit at 106 and a pin from state runner-up Daiquan Anderson at 113 to extend the lead to 32-16 with three matches remaining.

Hebron made it a four-point match again after wins from Yahir Lemus (120) and Adam Sherr (126) before Farace sealed the victory. \n“I was happy with our overall performance,” said Howell. “We kept an eye on the point total, obviously, and we knew that when it was a tough match at 195 that it was out of reach because we knew we had an opportunity to get a couple six-[point wins] in the lightweights.” \nOakland Mills will face North Hagerstown on the road Friday before competing in the 1A/2A South regional duals on Feb. 8, while Mt. Hebron might be on the outside looking in in the 3A/4A East regional duals with the loss. It hosts South River, which currently holds the No. 1 spot in the region, on Thursday with the likelihood that it will need a win to qualify for the fourth spot. \n“We’re on the bubble. We were fourth but with this loss it’s tight and we might be out, but we have a lot of things to build on,” Harman said. “Going forward I think we’re a solid team and we’re just going to continue to build.” \nOakland Mills (10-1 county, 15-6 overall) — 38, Mt.
