He spent 'millions' to acquire and maintain an expensive art collection, made up of over 200 collectable pieces from famous artists like Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat. \n\nBasquiat's \"Self-Portrait\" is just one of the pieces he has owned. It was put up for auction at Christie's in 2016 with a realised price of over £3.5 million (over $4.7 million). \nHe has 40 full-time employees around the world, costing him $300,00 a month, including personal security for him and his family every hour of every day. Fred Prouser / Reuters Over the years he has also spent $10 million to support his 'friends, family, and certain employees,' according to TMG. Frank Micelotta / Getty \nThis includes living expenses for his sisters and late mother. He bought his mother a multi-million dollar home in Hollywood, as well as a $35,000 a month residence for her when she was ill. \nDepp also funded a start-up music label run by a childhood friend. It cost him over $4 million with no revenue before he ultimately cut funding. Perhaps his most peculiar expense is the $3 million he spent to fulfil friend Hunter S. Thompson’s dream of having his ashes \"blast from a specially-made cannon\" over Aspen, Colorado following his death in 2005. And, if that's not enough, he allegedly has $55,000 still owing on a Visa card.
