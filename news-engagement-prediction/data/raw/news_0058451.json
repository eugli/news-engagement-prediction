Appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert this week, the 81-year-old - who played the titular role - recalled the moment she filmed the iconic umbrella scene, revealing the stunt was pretty dangerous to create. \"There was a very dangerous day right at the end of filming when I was in this excruciatingly painful harness,\" the legendary actress explained. \"And I was hanging around up there for the longest time with the umbrella. I thought I felt the wire leave and drop about six inches. I was nervous and very tired.\" \nGALLERY: What happened to the original stars of Mary Poppins? \n\"So I called down and I said, 'Excuse me, when you do let me down, could you let me down really gently, because I felt myself slip and I just don't feel too safe up here,'\" she added. Julie, who won an Academy Award for her role in the film, then revealed she \"plummeted\" to the stage. \"There was an awful silence for a minute and I did let fly with a few Anglo-Saxon four-letter words, I have to admit,\" she continued.

I think I just have the one scene and a little song and dance in it.\" \nSTORY: Dick Van Dyke confirms he will star in the Mary Poppins sequel \nExpected to be released in Christmas 2018, the highly-anticipated reboot will be directed by Rob Marshall , who was behind the Oscar-winning movie Chicago .
