[], "text": "Rajput organisation Shree Rajput Karni Sena , which last month vandalised the set of Sanjay Leela Bhansali 's 'Padmavati' in Jaipur, on Tuesday said there is a need to create a 'pre-Censor Board' to monitor all period films and prevent any misrepresentation of history. \n\nThe representatives, in a press conference, said they will approach the Information and Broadcasting Ministry to put forth this demand. \"In our opinion, a pre-censor board consisting of experts should supervise and monitor any historical film to be made. This will help in overcoming the complications which come up during or after the film is made,\" said Lokendra Singh Kalvi , Founder, Shree Rajput Karni Sena. \n\nA brief history of Sanjay Leela Bhansali vs culture senas Call it an unfortunate coincidence or occupational hazard, but each time Bhansali, Ranveer and Deepika have come together for a film, it has always ended up raising the hackles of culture’s self-appointed ‘custodians’. \n\"We are not taking offence towards every form of art... But tampering the glory of Rajput history is something that needs to be considered with great amount of seriousness,\" he added. \n\nActivists of Shree Rajput Karni Sena had last month protested, misbehaved and manhandled the crew of 'Padmavati'. They also damaged some cameras and other equipment, leading Bhansali to stop shooting since then. \n\nThe organisation said while they are not against art, they will not appreciate 'distortion of history'. 'Padmavati' is a film about Alauddin Khilji and Rani Padmavati , and Shree Rajput Karni Sena is concerned the movie will have intimate scenes between the characters, to be essayed by actors Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone . \n\nThey said the film's makers have assured them that there will be no intimate scene. Citing the example of Ashutosh Gowariker's 2008 film 'Jodhaa Akbar', Kalvi added that history had often been distorted by Bollywood . \"Truth often gets overshadowed by the subjectivity of perception which can mislead generations of audience and result in poor understanding of history,\" Kalvi said. \n\nHe claimed that in a letter sent on behalf of Bhansali's banner, 'Padmavati' makers have agreed officially to the demands posed by the Sena. \"No intimate scene should be shot between Alauddin Khilji and Rani Padmavati, even in the manner of a dream sequence,\" stated one of the demand posed by Sena, which they claimed was agreed upon by Bhansali's production. \n\nThe Sena, that met officials of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) a few days ago, said that the board told them that no action can be taken before the entire film is made. \n\n\"However, I have personally met the director who has assured us that the film will show no intimate scenes between Ranveer and Deepika,\" Kalvi said. \n\n‘Padmavati’ row: Bhansali arrives at a written agreement with Karni Sena and Rajput Sabha 00:42 \nCelebs at airport 1 600 Celebs at airport Kajol snapped at Mumbai airport on February 12, 2017.
