(City of Windsor)\nCouncil agreed on Tuesday to move ahead with creating a more detailed design of the site, at a cost of nearly $150,000.\nParade Corporation pushed out The decision was not without controversy with officials from the Windsor Parade Corporation arguing they will no longer be able to hold events at the festival site because of the new design.\n\"You can't put a bunch of trees and a park inside of the festival plaza and think that festival producers are going to be able to use that,\" said a frustrated David Gimaldi of the parade corporation.\nThe corporation hosts the Windsor Summerfest event on the waterfront every year, but that could change with the new design. Even if his group wanted to find a way to continue using the site for their festival, they couldn't, according to Gimaldi.\n\"We were told that we have to relocate,\" he said outside of council chambers Tuesday. \"No opportunity for dialogue. We have to relocate, end of discussion.\"\nWindsor city councillor, Rino Bortolin, said he doesn't want to kill Summerfest, but the hosts of other events will appreciate having some green space.\nCoun.

(CBC File Photo)\n\"Most festivals will find this a welcome change and basically adding to the experience of the festival-goer,\" he explained. \"Changing that layout so that it potentially could accommodate the midway is one option, obviously. Any option is on the table, including having it back up on the road like it used to be in years past.\"\nDetailed plans for the project are expected in June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:07:02.009+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
