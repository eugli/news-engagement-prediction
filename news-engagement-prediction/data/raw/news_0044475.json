Their players had won hearts in the 2015 World Cup and in the qualifying matches of the World T20 held in India last year. \nNabi's family had moved to Pakistan's Peshawar from Afghanistan during the peak of the Soviet War. It is there that a 10-year-old Nabi took up cricket and honed his skills to become one of Afghanistan's most reverred cricketers over the years. \nHaving made his ODI debut in 2009, Nabi quickly made a name for himself. He has so far played 72 one-day internationals and 52 T20Is. \nIn T20 Internationals, Nabi is a name to be reckoned with. His accurate off-spinners have so far fetched him 56 wickets and he boasts of a decent economy rate of 6.96. \nAnd do not forget, Nabi ranks fourth in the ICC's all-rounders list for T20 Internationals.
