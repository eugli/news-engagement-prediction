(Photo: Facebook) A couple has decided to continue with the woman’s pregnancy to full term despite knowing that the baby would not be able to survive long after birth so that they can help save multiple lives through organ donation. Keri Young and her husband Royce of Oklahoma had found out that their unborn second child – a girl – has a fatal condition called anencephaly at 19 weeks.\n This is our daughter's perfect heart. She has perfect feet and perfect hands. She has perfect kidneys, perfect lungs and a perfect liver. Sadly, she doesn't have a perfect brain. We found out recently she has anencephaly and is terminal. Faced with terrible options we have decided to continue the pregnancy to full term so Eva, which literally means life, can grow strong and give life to multiple people through organ donation. This was not an easy decision. For the next 20 weeks I will feel her kick, have the hiccups and we'll be able to hear her perfect heart beating all while knowing we'll only get a few short hours with her when she's born. As you might expect, we're devastated but have an amazing support system with our family, friends, church and doctors. We're choosing to try and see the positives in this situation and cherish our time with Eva, and be grateful for the impact she will have on the world in the short amount of time she'll spend in it.\nA post shared by Keri Young (@keriyoung) on Dec 13, 2016 at 4:54pm PST\nThe parents were heartbroken after the scan showed that the baby, who had an otherwise perfect body, would not have a normally developed brain. They are now chronicling the pregnancy on social media in order to share their story with the world.\n \"It's my body.\" These words hurt me to the core. Today I watched my husband, my very best friend, cry as he told a brief story about Eva. I watched as he stumbled over his words and try to talk about our terminal daughter. A daughter we'll only get to hold for a few days at most. I know our decision to carry Eva to term was hard. Believe me, I remember that agony. Sure, it's my body. But it's his child in my body. Half him, half me. Today is Sanctity of Human Life Sunday. Today we dedicated Eva. Also, we watched a couple dedicate two boys they adopted from foster care. Life means life outside of the womb too!\nA post shared by Keri Young (@keriyoung) on Jan 22, 2017 at 12:30pm PST\nKeri and Royce have named their unborn daughter Eva. Their brave decision has resonated with many people online.", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BN-mnMjgdsA/", "https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fkeridyoung%2Fposts%2F10104828806025907&width=500", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPlIMEdAnfc/"], "published": "2017-02-25T04:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T10:56:47.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
