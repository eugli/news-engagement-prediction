The cramped dressing rooms, the plastic pitch and, according to this clip that went viral on Twitter, the rather unorthodox defensive tactics of the Sutton players. The television cameras captured the bizarre moment when, as Arsenal speedster Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain steamed past him down the wing, Sutton captain Jamie Collins tried to put him off with what onlookers described as a 'headbutt'. With Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain speeding down the wing, Sutton's Jamie Collins closes in The Sutton captain appeared to push his head forward to try and put the Arsenal man off The Arsenal flyer wasn't deterred, however, and tore on down the wing Oxlade-Chamberlain caught up with the ball ahead of him and delivered a cross Oh my God he's tried to headbutt him, this is truly the magic of the cup in action. pic.twitter.com/3f21Zv7Hqm â€” Mundial Magazine (@MundialMag) February 20, 2017 Sutton United captain Jamie Collins plays a ball under pressure from Jeff Reine-Adelaide There was no stopping Oxlade-Chamberlain, but Collins perhaps hoped he'd be distracted if he got as close as possible without making contact. The two-second clip soon found its way onto social media, where bemused fans described it as the most non-league thing ever. Collins tries to get to grips with another Arsenal speed merchant, Theo Walcott The Sutton skipper rises above Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina but head over the bar Oxlade-Chamberlain didn't flinch, however, and went on to deliver a cross. Arsenal were 2-0 up at the time, courtesy of goals from Lucas Perez and Theo Walcott, and that was the final outcome. The Gunners, having safely negotiated this banana skin tie at Gander Green Lane, will host another non-league side in Lincoln City in the quarter-finals next month.
