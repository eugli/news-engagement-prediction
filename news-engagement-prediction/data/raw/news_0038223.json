However, readjust the camera lens ever so slightly and suddenly events are cast in a whole new light. Sometimes, being a hero means accepting the people's scorn and hatred. Mojo Jojo is what happens when you cross Dr. Doom with a chimpanzee: a genius, ego-maniacal sociopath who also satisfies geek culture’s appetite for monkey-related humour. Source: Wiki \nIn the tenth anniversary episode of The Powerpuff Girls , Mojo Jojo succeeds in becoming ruler of the world and uses his knowledge and authority to end wars, eliminate hunger, and deliver free puppies to everyone. \nIs this a case of abrupt character transformation, or have this villain's actions been misunderstood from the beginning? If Mojo Jojo's backstory is to believed, it's the latter. Source: Wiki \nSugar. Spice. And everything nice. These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect little girl. But Professor Utonium accidentally added an EXTRA INGREDIENT to the concoction.... CHEMICAL X. What if I were to tell you that it was no accident? It was Mojo Jojo who did this? Yes! He was the reason why the Powerpuff Girls were born in the first place. Source: Pinterest He was the pet monkey of the professor and they were best friends. In a way he was a son to the professor, spending time with him and helping him with experiments. Then there was an explosion. His skull gets literally blown open, and from the ashes rise three girls. Having been exposed to radiation during the whole process, he's gifted with super-intelligence and the professor doesn't give a single shit, completely forgetting he even exists. While the professor turns all his attention to his super powered daughters, Mojo Jojo slinks off into the world. He starts committing crimes and fighting the girls that stole his happy life from him, but always loses. All he really wants is his dad back. Source: Uncyclopedia But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. This quote from Rocky Balboa is a special reminder of what Mojo is really capable of. He keeps getting bullied and beaten up by the three girls (who stole his dad) but does he quit trying? No. He keeps trying and never gives up. Mojo Jojo is the hero we needed but not the one we deserved. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:43:42.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
