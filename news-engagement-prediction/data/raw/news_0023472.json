February 8th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Football/Asian Champions League/ Tommy Oar-chestrates stunner \nFox Sports commentator Ned Zelic added: “He’s always had potential... what’s impressed me from his game is just that he works so hard for the team to get back and defend. He’s a tremendous attacking player.” \n“If you didn’t see Brisbane’s win over Tevez and co, it was no fluke,” wrote Fox Sports’ Adam Peacock on Twitter. \nThe victory is made all the more impressive by the fact the Roar battled out a goalless draw against the undefeated Sydney FC on Friday night and had to endure almost freezing conditions in Shanghai. \nBut their manager wasn’t surprised by the victory.

February 9th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/sourceId/607595/ Aloisi: We aren't surprised \n“It was a brilliant result - a tough game, but bloody hell, it was an unbelievable atmosphere, and a really good performance.” \nFox Sports commentator Mark Rudan added that it’s a “momentous” occasion for Australian football. \nBrisbane have been to the Champions League twice before but never made it past the group stages. \n“The players that have been in there before are excited. Matty McKay especially, he was one of the happiest after the game because he wants that opportunity,” Aloisi said. 'The miss of an eternity' 1:04 \nFootball: Highlights from the ACL.
