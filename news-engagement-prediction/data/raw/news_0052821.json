Simon & Schuster and its Threshold Editions imprint announced Monday that “after careful consideration” they had pulled the book, which had been high on Amazon.com’s bestseller lists and was the subject of intense controversy.\nDangerous was originally scheduled to come out in March. But Yiannopoulos had pushed back the release to June so he could write about the uprisings during his recent campus tour.\nMore than 100 Simon & Schuster authors had objected to his book deal. Author Roxane Gay withdrew a planned book with the publisher in protest of his book deal. \nThe cancellation of the book deal comes days after Jeremy Scahill, the founding editor of the online news publication The Intercept, cancelled his appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher last week in protest of Yiannopoulos’ appearance on the same show.\nArticle Continued Below Read more: \nViolent protests force cancellation of speech by Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley \nChildren’s authors among 160 literaries denouncing publisher for right wing book \nTwitter bans Breitbart editor over abuse of Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones \nMeanwhile, Yiannopoulos has also been disinvited to this year’s Conservative Political Action Conference after his attempt to clarify past comments on relationships between boys and older men fell flat with organizers.\nThe American Conservative Union founded and hosts CPAC, which is being held Wednesday through Saturday outside Washington. In a tweet on Monday, ACU chairman Matt Schlapp said that “due to the revelation of an offensive video in the past 24 hours condoning pedophilia, the American Conservative Union has decided to rescind the invitation of Milo Yiannopoulos to speak.”\nAfter the polarizing Breitbart News editor was invited, his invitation sparked a backlash. The conservative Reagan Battalion blog tweeted video clips Sunday in which Yiannopoulos discussed Jews, sexual consent, statutory rape, child abuse and homosexuality.\nThe episode, which unspooled quickly online over the weekend, put many conservatives in a deeply uncomfortable position. They have long defended Yiannopoulos’ attention-seeking stunts and racially charged antics on the grounds that the left had tried to hypocritically censor his right to free speech.\nBut endorsing pedophilia, it seemed, was more than they could tolerate. The board of the American Conservative Union, which includes veterans of the conservative movement like Grover Norquist and Morton Blackwell, made the decision to revoke Yiannopoulos’ speaking slot and condemn his comments on Monday.\n“We initially extended the invitation knowing that the free speech issue on college campuses is a battlefield where we need brave, conservative standard-bearers,” Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, said in a written statement.\nRegarding Yiannopoulos’ comments, Schlapp called them “disturbing” and said his explanation of them was insufficient.\nAfter the video leaked, Yiannopoulos denied that he had ever condoned child sexual abuse, noting that he was a victim himself as he blamed his “British sarcasm” and “deceptive editing” for leading to a misunderstanding.\nBut in the tape, the fast-talking polemicist is clear that he has no problem with older men abusing children as young as 13, which he then conflates with relationships between older and younger gay men who are of consenting age.\n“No, no, no. You’re misunderstanding what pedophilia means,” Yiannopoulos says on the tape, in which he is talking to radio hosts in a video chat. “Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty,” he adds, dismissing the fact that 13-year-olds are children.\nThe notion of consent, he says, is “arbitrary and oppressive.”\nConservatives reacted with near unanimous disgust at the comments. Some expressed bewilderment that conference organizers would extend an invitation to Yiannopoulos in the first place, given his history of statements that have been offensive to blacks, Muslims and generally pushed the bounds of decency. Twitter has banned him.\n“Colossal misjudgment,” Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, wrote on Twitter. “Now CPAC has put itself in the role of ‘censor.’ And for what? Some clicks and headlines?”\nGuy Benson, the writer and radio host, who also happens to be gay, wrote on Twitter that Yiannopoulos seemed to have been “designed in a laboratory in order to perpetuate some of the ugliest stereotypes about gays and conservatives.”\nOn Facebook, Yiannopoulos blamed deceptive editing and his own “sloppy phrasing” for any indication he supported pedophilia. The British author said he spoke of his own relationship when he was 17 with a man who was 29. The age of consent in the U.K. is 16.\nIt’s unclear who edited the videos.\n“We realize that Mr. Yiannopoulos has responded on Facebook, but it is insufficient,” Schlapp said. “We urge him to immediately further address these disturbing comments.”\nSchlapp said the invitation was initially extended knowing that free speech on college campuses is a “battlefield where we need brave, conservative standard-bearers.”\nBut he added: “There is no disagreement among our attendees on the evils of sexual abuse of children.”\nWith files from the New York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:37:24.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
