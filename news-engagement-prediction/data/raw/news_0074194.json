There was a run of four days early in January, two of which got about 35. \n\"But generally it's just been a couple of hotter days followed by reasonable cool spells in between. \n\"So it certainly felt like a mild summer, even though when you look at the figures across the three months we stack up fractionally above average for Melbourne for temperature.\" \nOn December 28, Melbourne sweltered through its second hottest night on record, with 27.4C recorded at 12:30am. 'Indian summer' on the cards for March \nAnd in some more pleasant news, those dreaded cold days may be a little while off. \nMr Williams said Melbourne was likely to experience warmer-than-average conditions in Autumn. \n\"March is quite often a warm month, and we quite often can get decent runs above 30,\" he said. \n\"So that means we can look forward to somewhat of an Indian summer further into Autumn and perhaps some reasonable runs of pleasant, warm days.\" \nThe last time Melbourne had a 40-degree-free summer was 2014-15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:06:00.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
