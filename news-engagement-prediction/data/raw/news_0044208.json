I am part of Western democracy!” 17:32 Tory MP says we must continue as a \"candid friend\" to the US \nBack in the debate, Tory MP Simon Burns says we must not compromise the national interest just because of “personal” views of someone. \nNo matter how “grotesque” they may be. \n“I believe it is in our national interest to ensure we can continue to be a candid friend to the United States.” 17:29 Furious protesters say “tear down fences, open the borders\" \nOne woman is dressed as the “Statue of Taking Liberties”. \nAnd protesters wield signs reading “Stand up to racism. No to racism, no to Trump”; “Dump Trump, fight bigotry”; and “Tear down fences, open the borders”. \nBanners from the pro-Jeremy Corbyn Momentum group, the CWU union and the School of Oriental and African Studies” are being held aloft as night falls over Parliament Square. (Photo: PA) \nLucy Howell, 20, a student from Leeds, said: “I came here to show solidarity, it’s about making as much noise as possible to the British government that young people don’t approve of Trump. \n“The biggest reason I’m against Trump is his sheer hatred abs fascism towards minority, migrant and vulnerable communities.”Retired local government officer Malcolm Inkston, 58, of Lincoln, said: “I’m motivated by the despicable, megalomaniac policies of Trump, the racist misogynist. \n“The travel ban is ridiculous and shows his attitude to human rights.” 17:25 KEY EVENT Tory MP wants state visit for PUTIN even though \"they have nuclear missiles pointed at us\" \nTory MP James Cartlidge has warned the Kremlin will win if Britain cancels Trump’s state visit. \n“There will be smiles all round in the Kremlin if we follow this petition,” he told MPs. \nThat’s because the Kremlin wants to “divide the west”, he said, and “we would be crackers to do so.” \nHe even said: “Our foreign policy is about the national interest of the UK. \n“I would offer a state visit to Vladimir Putin as was done by Tony Blair. That’s despite the fact Russian Bear bombers are buzzing our airspace, that they have nuclear missiles pointed at us, that they pose this huge threat. \n“That’s precisely why we do it, because we want to influence the administration.” 17:18 Salmond says \"gunpowder plot\" to oust Speaker over Trump will \"fizzle out\" \nSpeaking in the debate, SNP MP Alex Salmond, the former First Minister of Scotland who had some tense correspondence with Trump, called for the state visit to be called off. \nAnd he was ticked off for slamming Tory MPs who used Trump’s ban from Parliament as an excuse to oust the House of Commons Speaker. \nHe fumed: “The gunpowder plot, this new one, will fizzle out just as surely as the last one did.” 17:14 Ben Glaze Meanwhile... view from the protest in Parliament Square \nMeanwhile the protest is kicking off in Parliament Square, which is mostly full of demonstrators against Trump’s state visit. \nOur reporter Ben Glaze has been canvassing opinion on why people are there. \nGary Martinez , 46, on holiday from the Philippines, said: “This is about showing solidarity with our fellow migrants. \n“Migrants should not be bargaining chips for world leaders. \n“Why is Donald Trump trying to sew fear and hate about migrants and immigrants and refugees?” \nEmilia Staniaszek , 17, a student from west London, said: “I came here because I’m angry and I want to bold. \n“I hate racism and bigotry, I think they’re gross. \n“Donald Trump is smarmy and I can’t trust him. \n“His travel ban scared me because there’s so much hope for migrants moving from place to place - that’s why they do it. \n“But his ban kills hope, especially in a thriving place like America which is so diverse. \n“It’s really important that everywhere is open.” (Photo: Rex) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:45:35.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
