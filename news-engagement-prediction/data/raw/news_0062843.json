Roosevelt - 3,728, EOs 6071-9537 \nRevoking An Executive Order In 1988, President Reagan banned abortions at military hospital except in cases of rape or incest or when the mother's life is threatened. President Clinton rescinded it with another executive order. A Republican Congress then codified this restriction in an appropriations bill. Welcome to the Washington, D.C. merry-go-round.Because executive orders relate to how one president manages his executive branch team, there is no requirement that subsequent presidents follow them. They may do as Clinton did, and replace an old executive order with a new one or they may simply revoke the prior executive order.Congress can also revoke a presidential executive order by passing a bill by a veto-proof (2/3 vote) majority. For example, in 2003 Congress unsuccessfully attempted to revoke President Bush's Executive Order 13233 , which had rescinded Executive Order 12667 (Reagan). The bill, HR 5073 , did not pass. Controversial Executive Orders Presidents have been accused of using the power of the executive order to make, not merely implement, policy. This is controversial, as it subverts the separation of powers as outlined in the Constitution.President Lincoln used the power of presidential proclamation to initiate the Civil War. On 25 December 1868, President Andrew Johnson issued the \" Christmas Proclamation ,\" which pardoned \"all and every person who directly or indirectly participated in the late insurrection or rebellion\" related to the Civil War. He did so under his constitutional authority to grant pardons; his action was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court.President Truman desegregated the armed forces via Executive Order 9981 . During the Korean War, on 8 April 1952, Truman issued Executive Order 10340 in order to avert a steel mill workers strike called for the following day. He did so with public regret . The case -- --Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) -- went all the way to the Supreme Court, which sided with the steel mills. Workers [url link=http://www.democraticcentral.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=1865]immediately went on strike. A half million workers were laid off as companies lacked steel to keep plants running. The number of railroad cars loaded in the week ending July 7, 1952, was the lowest since records had been kept, and many railroads began to suffer financial difficulty. California growers faced a loss of $200 million because there was not enough steel to make cans for their vegetable crops. On July 22, the United States Army shut down its largest shell-making plant due to a lack of steel. \nPresident Eisenhower used Executive Order 10730 to begin the process of desegregating America's public schools.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:06:34.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
