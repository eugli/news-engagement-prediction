Between a loss of state funding and voters refusing to pay an extra 13 cents in property taxes, the district has been left to devise its own methods of fixing its budget. \nWhen it comes to school budget cuts, it’s rare for there to be an easy or simple solution. However, one particularly interesting idea made its way into Thursday’s brainstorming session: “ reasonable ‘self-service’ programs to reduce custodial needs. ” The suggestion essentially means that the district is being asked to consider having students use time during the school day to take out the garbage.

Students who wish to play sports could be looking at paying $100 to $200 to stay active and play on a team. “ I know people who have two, three, four kids that it would impact and that’s a lot of money, ” local parent Melissa Bradbury told KXAS. \nThe district is also considering having students pay to ride the school bus. \nTeachers and administrators are also on the chopping block for budget cuts. Instead of having students be transported from different schools to take classes, one suggestion includes having students either take online classes or have their teachers travel. Given that Texas is in the lower third of teacher salaries, having to travel could be costly in terms of both time and money. \nLibrary aids could be replaced with volunteers or have their jobs shared with tech support. \nLess troubling measures would include trademarking the schools’ logos, charging for event parking and charging more for tickets to events. However, all of these are only suggestions until the budget is approved in April. \nThe $30 million deficit created by the end of a fund called Additional State Aid for Tax Reduction has already opened a can of worms for the district, however. Four new schools will not open in the 2017-2018 school year to save money, according to the Houston Chronicle.
