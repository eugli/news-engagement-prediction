It might be about the time you were left penniless, or about another time when there was a bloke sat there rinsing everyone of their cash, having every punter gorp at him in awe of his ability/luck. \nWhat you've probably never witnessed in an abundance of trips to Grosvenors or Gentings, is a 96-year-old geezer sitting at a poker table being an absolute boss. \nIf I saw my granddad kicking chills in a casino I'd be 50% made up and 50% shocked. On the one hand it'd be great for my mates to see how much of a badass he is, but on the other hand I'd be a bit worried about whether my nan knew he was there spending all her money. I'd be doubly shocked too, because he died in 2009. \nvia GIPHY \nHowever, even if he was going all out in a Grosvenor, splashing 50s on tables and racking up a huge bar tab, he still wouldn't be anywhere near as cool as Jack Ury. \nThe 96-year-old endured a lot of media attention and became adored by fans. Even at his tender age he used to sit through 14 hour days of poker after being wheeled to tables by his grandson. Being blind in one eye, having limited vision in the other, and deaf in one ear didn't deter him away from his passion. \nPerhaps his defining moment came during the 2009 World Series of Poker, when he openly destroyed Stephen Friedlander. \nAfter falling short on his previous hand, Ury bet 1,000 and Friedlander moved all-in. Calling Friedlander, Ury's opponent turned over a 7 of hearts and a 6 of hearts for a full house. He got a bit cocky about it, thinking he was ending the 96-year-old's time at the tournament. \nUnfortunately for Friedlander, Ury told him \"you're in trouble,\" before finally showing his 7 of diamonds and 7 of clubs for a better full house. \nCredit: World Series of Poker \nIf you thought that was impressive, this amateur poker player bagged himself $1.6million after bagging first prize in a tournament he entered with just $160. The lucky bastard. \nShurane Vijayaram, 33, who had little to no experience among professional ranks, trounced a total of 723 players to take home the Aussie Millions Poker Championships with a lousy pocket fives. \nVijayaram had recently paid $130 to enter an amateur tournament just a week before, winning a $10,600 entry into the Aussie Millions main draw. \n\"I've always just tried to play cards and relax, it's only a game,\" Vijayaram told Age newspaper . \"I just try to play my best game and not think about people that are really good players. It doesn't matter who you are, you just have to get the cards.\" Featured Image Credit: World Series of Poker Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:43:46.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
