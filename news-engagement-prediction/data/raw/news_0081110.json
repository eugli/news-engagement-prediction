But for some lucky elementary schoolers, it's also a thing of the past. The Washington Post reports that the Orchard School in South Burlington, Vermont, which educates students from pre-kindergarten to fifth grade, instituted a no-homework policy six months ago and has seen kids flourish ever since. Advertisement \nPrincipal Mark Trifilio told the Post that he and a unanimous group of teachers came up with the policy because different classes had different loads of homework, and that research found homework in elementary school wasn't necessarily linked to success. The only thing that was proven to work was reading after school. \nSo the new policy was this: No homework, but kids must read \"just-right books\" every night, and have their parents read to them, too. Also, they must pledge to get outside and play (without their screens), eat dinner with their families, and get a good night's sleep. The school provides suggestions for books, but doesn't require written logs of how often kids read. \n\"They're just kids. They're pretty young and they just put in a full day's shift at work and so we just don't believe in adding more to their day. We also feel that we are squashing their other passions and interest in learning,\" Trifilio told The Associated Press back in September. \nNow, six months later, Trifilio says students have not suffered whatsoever, and have not fallen behind in their subjects. Most parents have supported the new policy, and some even say their kids are reading on their own more than before. \nHowever, some parents worry their kids won't be ready when homework hits in middle school. Trifilio says he's working on solutions to that, including assigning bigger projects that require kids to learn long-term planning, like presentations or science experiments. \n\"We have a first grader, and at her age [homework is] as much a chore for the parents as the kids,\" parent Rani Philip told the Burlington Free Press . \"Instead we've been spending time reading. We don't have to rush.\" Loading more articles... ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:20:59.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
