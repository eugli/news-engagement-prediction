Image copyright AP Image caption There have been warm words for Trump in Moscow \nPolitico, Buzzfeed and the Daily Mail were also left out, but CNN was the only major US television network to be denied entry. \nThe Associated Press, USA Today and Time magazine refused to attend as a protest. \nThe BBC's bureau chief in Washington, Paul Danahar, said the BBC has a representative at every daily White House briefing and it was not clear why they were barred from Friday's session. He is seeking clarification from the White House press team. Media caption Where do Donald Trump supporters get their news from? \nDuring the briefing, Mr Spicer addressed reports that White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus had asked the FBI to publicly dispute media stories about contacts between the Trump campaign and Moscow. \nHe said Mr Priebus had little choice but to seek assistance in rejecting what Mr Spicer said were inaccurate reports. The FBI did not issue the statement requested. \nMr Trump has been dogged by claims of alleged links to Moscow since his presidential campaign. \nThe president asked for national security adviser Michael Flynn's resignation last week after he misled Vice-President Mike Pence about his contacts with Russia's ambassador during the transition.
