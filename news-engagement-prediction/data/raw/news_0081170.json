February 28th 2017 7 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Australian Human Rights Commission Race Discrimination Commissioner Tim Soutphommasane has been accused of encouraging the number of complaints. Picture: Glenn Hunt Staff writers News Corp Australia Network Share Share on Twitter \nNINE white men are among a growing number of people lodging claims of racial discrimination with the Australian Human Rights Commission. \nMost of the 71 complaints lodged with the commission in the past year were from Aborigines and Indians but almost 15 per cent were white men, The Australian reports. \nOther complaints, where a race was identified, came from people identifying as Chinese, Maori, Persian, Scottish, Pakistani, Jewish, Arab, Turkish and one who had a “dark complexion”. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull launched the review of the Racial Discrimination Act last year. Picture: Kym Smith Source: News Corp Australia \nThere were just 18 complaints to the Commission in the 12 months to March 2016. \nA parliamentary committee will table a review of Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act today, which will also look at whether the complaints-handling procedures of the Commission should be reformed. \nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull ordered the inquiry after pressure from his party over a string of cases last year, including complaints over a Bill Leak cartoon and university students’ Facebook posts. \nRELATED: Malcolm Turnbull promised 18C changes ahead of Tony Abbott spill \nThe Australian reports one of the inquiry’s recommendations will be for the Turnbull Government to scrap the terms “insult and offence” and replace it with the tougher test of “vilify” or “harass”. Senator David Leyonhjelm last year lodged a formal complaint with the Human Rights Commission under race hate laws for being publicly labelled an “angry white male”.

Deputy Opposition leader Tanya Plibersek says Labor will not support changes to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.
