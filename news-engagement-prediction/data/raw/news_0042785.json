Announced via release, Chef Jean Philippe Gaston will soon introduce six new noodle-based options, and this isn’t going to be your average ramen. In addition to classic miso and shoyu broths, diners will also be able to score a bowl of Mexican-inspired menudo ramen, Korean-inspired kimchi noodles, and mazemen (translation: broth is served on the side for dipping) served with chicken, mushrooms, and brandy-cured foie gras. The ramen menu will make its debut at Izakaya on March 1, at which time bowls will be served at $12-$14 each. But on March 11, the restaurant will serve up each new option for just $5 in celebration of National Noodle Day. Made-up food holidays are generally terrible, but nobody will judge you for taking advantage in order to score a cheap bowl of ramen.
