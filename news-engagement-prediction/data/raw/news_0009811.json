Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!”\nAny negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 \n\nI call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 \n\nThe tweets came after a Seattle judge placed a temporary restraining order on Trump’s immigration executive order . The decision prohibits federal employees from enforcing any part of the executive order. The Department of Justice filed an appeal of the decision on Saturday and the case will head to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.\nTrump was likely responding to a new CNN/ORC poll released Friday that found that most Americans oppose Trump’s immigration executive order banning travel from seven different countries for 90 days, temporarily suspending the refugee program, and cutting back the total number of refugees allowed to enter the country for the year. Fifty-three percent of people polled said they oppose the executive order, and 6 in 10 people said they oppose Trump’s plan to build a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico.\nA Gallup poll taken last week likewise showed that the travel ban is broadly unpopular, with 55 percent of Americans disapproving of the measure while only 42 percent support it. On the other hand, a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken Jan. 30-31 found that a slight plurality (49 percent to 41 percent) approved of the measure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:23:56.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
