Yet for all their beauty and symbolism they are also one of the most notorious suicide spots in the world. \nPhotographer Brian David Stevens has been documenting the area from Beachy Head to Birling Gap for the past year, recording both the changing seasons and the small crosses that dot the cliff tops, each one a memorial to a life. \nWriter Robert Macfarlane commented on Brian's pictures: \"These are special images. I've never seen Beachy Head look like this. You make the billowing earth and the billowing cloud speak to one another. \n\"And those circling birds, aloft in the way that the suicides might long to be, reminded me of a line of Paul Claudel's that I quoted somewhere in Mountains of the Mind: 'We lack wings to fly, but will always have strength to fall.'\" \nBut perhaps the images speak for themselves.
