Could   \nCoronation Street is getting a new business - and the news has sent fans into a guessing frenzy. \nBosses at ITV have embarked on an ambitious extension of the set for the show in Media City, Salford, Greater Manchester. \nIt heralds the broadcast of six episodes a week later this year. \nA police station, a school and a court have already been promised, but now it appears more businesses will be moving into Weatherfield with a new business on a new street; Kitchener St. The news has sent fans into a guessing frenzy (Photo: PA) \nThe new name of the street could be a blind by producers with hints that we could be getting Tile Street as well as other roads often referred to over the years. \nThe planning application - submitted earlier this month - shows the new two storey building with proposed signage on the front which gives little clue to the nature of the business. \nThe location of the set store would also be around the same place as the upcoming construction on Victoria Street.

Corrie is set to broadcast of six episodes a week later this year (Photo: ITV) \nKieron added that it would maximise screen time for a number of lesser-seen actors with additional storylines. \nThe expansion will also lead to more than 40 new jobs for crew and writers, to facilitate the expansion. \n“The street will open up a whole range of new possibilities for the writers to work with,” he said. \n“It’s inevitable that a whole new street of homes will bring new families and drama with it.” \nThere are four main streets currently on the long-running soap, and many more that are often mentioned but not seen on camera. \nRosamund Street used to be the home of cornershop the Kabin, Victoria Street is where Roy’s Rolls is based, and the bistro and garage are on Viaduct Street. \nThe Rovers Return pub, and a number of the main characters’ homes are located on Coronation Street itself.
