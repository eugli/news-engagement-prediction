And, when some are capitalizing on this fear, we are especially inspired by the next generation, who are able to acknowledge the complex system they have inherited while simultaneously vowing to change it. Like DuVernay, they understand that we must come face to face with our past before we can fix our future.” \nThe educational public access is a part of Netflix's extension of the community screening program. The program also includes the 2017 Oscar-nominated documentary shorts Extremis and The White Helmets , along with docs The Ivory Game, Winter on Fire, Audrie and Daisy and Into the Inferno .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T19:56:53.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
