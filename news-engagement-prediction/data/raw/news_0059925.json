Jay Cutler (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:34 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:34 a.m. ET \nAs trade rumors circle around Jay Cutler, the soon-to-be 34-year-old quarterback reportedly is seriously thinking about retirement. \n\"It is no guarantee that Cutler even plays in 2017. [He's] one of several veterans who are still considering whether they want to play, whether they want to not play, retire, walk away,\" Ian Rapoport said on NFL Network . \"A lot of things in play here for Jay Cutler.\" \nMORE: NFL free agency 2017: Top free agents, best players by position, key dates \nRapoport added, \"If it's not perfect, if he can't find the team he wants, or the contract he wants, it's very easy for Jay Cutler to walk away.\" \nIf accurate, that's a pretty strong stance for Cutler, who is coming off of a shortened season in which he required shoulder surgery. The veteran quarterback has shown promise throughout his career but hasn't been able to take that next step. \nA change of scenery could be good for him, but apparently only if it's on his terms. He probably wants to play for a winning team, or at least a team with a chance of winning. The problem is that most of the good teams already have quarterbacks. \nIt'd be surprising to see Cutler retire early, but he might want to save himself the embarrassment of playing for a bottom-dweller the rest of his career.
