As to be expected, these two smartphones continue to offer significant value for money. While the specs have seen a number of boosts and upgrades in various departments, what is the most obvious change this time around is the build quality. On last year’s Moto G4 and G4 Plus, Moto looked to offer an aluminum-like build quality and design. That is aluminium-like, as while it looked as though it sported an aluminium body, it was actually plastic made to simulate metal. This year, Moto G5 buyers will be getting an actual metal unibody build quality. \nWhile this certainly adds an aesthetic improvement to this year’s Moto G smartphones, it also does result in a more durable build. Another notable difference between this year’s and last year’s models is the size, as Moto has cut down the display on both of the new smartphones. While the Moto G4 and G4 Plus came with a 5.5-inch display, the Moto G5 Plus comes with a 5.2-inch display and the Moto G5 comes with an even more compact, 5-inch display. \nIn terms of the other differences between the two new models, there is not a lot really to focus in on. Both of the new Moto G5 smartphones come with a very similar build quality and design and even come with a fairly overlapping spec list. Although, the G5 Plus does come with a different processor, more internal storage and a larger battery. In addition to the already-mentioned, slightly-larger display size. Which does mean that whichever of the two new Moto G5 smartphones you consider picking up, you will be getting a similar experience overall. Both do come with a greatly improved and more durable build quality. Both are equipped with a fingerprint sensor for added security. Both do come with a fairly decent battery capacity and both do come running on Android 7.0 (Nougat). In fact, even their pricing is somewhat similar, although the G5 Plus is the only model which will be available in the US, with prices starting from $229. You can take a closer look at the two new new Moto G5 smartphones in the galleries below. \nMoto G5 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T19:33:02.147+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
