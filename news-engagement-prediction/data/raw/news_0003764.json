The Gunners’ title chances were given a significant blow against the Hornets at the Emirates Stadium, as they failed to recover from an early two-goal deficit. Wenger, who was in the stands due to his ongoing touchline ban, dismissed suggestions his team aren’t up for the fight but speculated his players were lacking the appropriate focus. “I don't think we have a power problem,” Wenger said, per Oliver Todd of the MailOnline. “But we were not mentally ready to deal with the physical duels.” He continued: “You don't win 47 points after 23 games with no physical power but we have to switch it on 100 per cent in the Premier League. That's what it's about. It was obvious we lost duels and were not sharp enough. It looked more mentally that we were not ready for the challenges.” Additionally, the Frenchman was adamant that had a few more breaks gone Arsenal’s way, they wouldn’t have lost, per football journalist Peter Hall: Peter Hall @PeteHall86 Wenger blaming luck: \"It was not good in the first half. We were a bit unlucky. After that we responded. We don't deserve to lose the game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:40:34.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
