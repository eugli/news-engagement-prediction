The music is by AR Rahman.(YouTube Grab) \nTrust Mani Ratnam and AR Rahman to treat us to pure delight on Valentine’s Day. A minute of a new song Vaan from the filmmaker’s upcoming romance, Kaatru Veliyidai, was released on Monday. Featuring Aditi Rao Hydari and Karthi, the song will transport the viewer to the land of pure love and magic. Read more Kaatru Veliyidai: Watch Aditi Rao Hydari’s arresting presence in Mani Ratnam’s next \nBathed in white (shot in heavy snowfall), the song is a celebration of love and romance in all its pristine glory. The lilting melody, Shashaa Tirupati’s vocals and a minimal use of instruments will arrest your attention immediately. Snow has never looked this beautiful. The white sheet is witness to Aditi’s passion as she enchants, dressed in a dark purple sari. The minute-long sequence is sprinkled with the build-up to their romance. Karthi is every bit a Mani Ratnam romantic hero -- a pleasant young man quite hopelessly in love. \nAditi’s beauty, her ardour and Karthi’s love, with snow playing Cupid, will put a smile on your face. Let the love spread. The passion, the ardour ... it’s all there. Karthi plays an air force officer. Aditi Rao Hydari will be seen as a doctor in the film. \nKaatru Veliyidai (breezy expanse) has been shot extensively in Kashmir with some parts being shot in Hyderabad, Ladakh, Belgrade (Serbia). The film, which will tentatively release in April 2017, boasts of seven songs, written by celebrated poet-lyricist Vairamuthu. \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T16:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:33:46.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
