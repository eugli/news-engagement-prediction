Staff members gather for a photo at Ben's Soft Pretzels inside the Meijer store in Homer Glen. (Ben's Soft Pretzels \\ Handout) Bob Bong Daily Southtown \nA new kind of soft pretzel shop opened last month in the Meijer store in Homer Glen . \nBen's Soft Pretzels opened Jan. 18 inside the store at 14169 S. Bell Road. \n\"We're up front on the grocery side of the store,\" said co-owner Lisa Brown, who lives in Orland Park . \nBrown owns the 950-square-foot store with her neighbor Jim Alfini, his mother-in-law Arline Pearson, and her mother, Loma Hall. \nThe group had been wanting to open their own business together and unanimously decided on Ben's Soft Pretzels after Brown discovered them while at a flower show in northwest Indiana. \n\"I couldn't believe how great they were,\" she said. \"I had to have one every day I was there. \n\"When I got home, I hoodwinked my neighbors into getting the franchise,\" she said with a laugh. \nBen's Soft Pretzels is Amish and Dutch inspired. The pretzels are similar to shopping mall varieties but are nearly twice as big \"and more delicious,\" she said. The pretzels are hand-rolled using a special proprietary dough and topped with imported German salt. \nIn addition to their signature jumbo pretzel, Brown said the bakery also offers pretzel bites called Buggy Bites, Pretzel Stix, all-beef Pretzel Dogs, and Pretzel Pockets with 11 different dipping sauces including cheese, mustard, marinara, and a variety of sweet options. \n\"We also have four shake options,\" she said, including Parmesan, cinnamon and sugar, sour cream and onion and garlic. \nThe shop also carries specialty sandwiches such as meatball, Italian and ham and cheese. \nBrown said the pretzels are great for noshing while walking around the store or for taking home. \"They warm up really well,\" she said. \nBrown said the staff is very friendly and interacts with the children who often stand outside the shop and watch as the pretzels are rolled and baked. \n\"We have such a good spot,\" she said. \nIf business is good, Brown said there may be additional ventures for her group. \n\"We might go mobile with a food truck in the future,\" she said. \"To take to festivals and events.\" \nShe also didn't rule out a second bakery in the Meijer store that opened in Mokena on the same day the Meijer store opened in Homer Glen. \nBrown said there are other Ben's locations in the Chicago area, including one in the Meijer in Flossmoor and another one in a Walmart in Forest Park. \nBrown said her location has some daily specials including buy one, get one jumbo pretzels from noon to 6 p.m. on Tuesdays, double dip Wednesdays and Photo Bomb Thursdays. \nStore hours are from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday to Friday, from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturdays and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays. \nFor information, check out their Facebook page at Ben's Soft Pretzels (HG).

LaGrange in the Frankfort Crossing shopping center closed recently after 33 years in Frankfort. \nAldi unveils nationwide remodeling plan \nAldi last week announced that it will spend $1.6 billion over the next three years to remodel and expand more than 1,300 stores in the U.S. including stores in Frankfort and Orland Park. \nThat's on top of its $3 billion plan to open 650 new stores in the U.S. by the end of 2018. \nOne of those new stores will be built at the corner of Archer and Harlem avenues in the Garfield Ridge neighborhood of Chicago across the street from southwest suburban Summit. \nA company spokesman said, \"We are committed to opening an Aldi store in Chicago at Archer Avenue and Harlem Avenue, with construction currently planned to begin in spring 2017 and an anticipated opening by the end of 2017.\" \nThe new store will be built on the former site of Joe & Frank's Market, which will be razed, along with two other buildings immediately south on Harlem Avenue and a couple of nearby homes. \nThe new store will be an L-shaped format similar to the Aldi location at 132nd Street and LaGrange Road in Orland Park. \nAfter the new store opens, a traditional warehouse-style store operated by Aldi at 5775 S. Archer will close. \nBob Bong is a freelancer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:37:17.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
