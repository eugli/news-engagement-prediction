It appeared to be an attempt by Israel's nationalist government to calm settler anger over the court-ordered removal of Amona, which was built two decades ago on private Palestinian land. Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline coalition is dominated by settlers and their allies. \nA late-night statement issued by the defence ministry said Mr Netanyahu and his defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, had approved the new construction. \nThe move followed an announcement days earlier of an additional 2,500 homes in the West Bank and more than 550 homes in east Jerusalem. The Palestinians claim both areas, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as parts of a future independent state - a position that has wide international backing. Watch | US explains why they abstained from UN-Israel resolution 01:42 \nT he international community considers settlements illegal and the United Nations Security Council in December passed a resolution stating stating that \"settlements in Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, had no legal validity, constituting a flagrant violation under international law.\" \nThe resolution, which passed with 14 votes for and one abstention, from US ambassador Samantha Power, enraged Israel and Mr Netanyahu vowed retaliation . \nMr Trump has signalled that he will abandon the policies of his predecessors and be far friendlier toward settlements. He has appointed a prominent US supporter of the settlements to be his ambassador to Israel , and a delegation of settler leaders was invited to his inauguration. \nThis has emboldened Mr Netanyahu, who repeatedly clashed with president Barack Obama over settlements, to announce a series of construction plans over the past week and a half. The Trump White House has remained silent, a dramatic departure from the vocal condemnations issued by Mr Obama. Donald Trump met Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, at Trump Tower in September Credit: Kobi Gideon/GPO \n\"We are in a new period in which life in Judea and Samaria is back on track,\" Mr Lieberman said in a statement using the Biblical term for the West Bank. \nM r Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with Mr Trump at the White House on February 15 , and the two men are expected to seek understandings on Israeli construction plans for the West Bank. \nThe announcement followed a military order, dated Monday, for residents of Amona to evacuate the area within 48 hours. Israeli media said residents could be removed as early as Wednesday morning. \nIsrael's supreme court ruled in 2014 that Amona was built on private Palestinian land and must be demolished . It has set February 8 as the final date for it to be destroyed. \nAmona is the largest of about 100 unauthorised outposts erected in the West Bank without permission but generally tolerated by the Israeli government. \nThe outpost, built in the 1990s, stretches out over a rugged, grassy hilltop and looks out across the valley onto Palestinian villages. \nThe Ynet news site said Israeli forces had cordoned off the outpost, but hundreds of youths managed to infiltrate to resist the impending evacuation. \nIn 2006, Israeli police demolished nine homes at Amona, setting off clashes pitting settlers and their supporters against police and soldiers . Several dozen trailers have remained and the outpost has become a symbol for the settlement movement. \nIts fate has threatened to rupture Mr Netanyahu's narrow coalition, which is dominated by ultranationalists who support settlements. \nMr Netanyahu has struggled to find a balance between appeasing his settler constituents and respecting Israel's supreme court, which has drawn the ire of hard-liners by ruling against the settlers.
