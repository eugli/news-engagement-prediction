During her Grammys performance, though, she took her fashion from fun to somewhat political — though part of it was so subtle, you just may have missed it. \nPerry took the stage to perform her new single, \"Chained To The Rhythm,\" alongside Skip Marley. The song's lyrics and overall message definitely show off a more conscious side of the pop star. \"So comfortable, we live in a bubble, a bubble/So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, the trouble,” she sings. Given the current political climate in the United States, lyrics like that are hard to overlook — especially when you factor in that Perry is a very outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter , and also participated in the Women's March in Washington DC . \nSimply put, Perry seems to have transformed her messaging from the sticky-sweet goodness of \"I Kissed A Girl\" to the nostalgic dance floor jam that was \"Teenage Dream,\" all the way to one that sends a bigger message. All of that considered, it's no surprise that she wore white pantsuit (a symbol of suffragettes and Clinton supporters) as well as an armband that said \"PERSIST.\" In case you missed it during the performance, check her out below.
