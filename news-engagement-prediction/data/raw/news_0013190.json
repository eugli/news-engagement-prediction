What does Dodd-Frank do? \nThe Dodd-Frank Act created new regulatory bodies and added hundreds of regulations through existing agencies in an effort to maintain financial market stability. \nA key new regulatory body is the Consumer Financial Protection Board, which protects retail customers across the financial sector, including banks, payday lenders, credit unions and mortgage services. \nFinancial institutions deemed \"too big to fail\" are subject to more capital requirements, which have forced banks to fund themselves more by raising money from shareholders than by borrowing. \nThere are also tougher rules limiting banks taking on riskier assets, which the industry says has been costly. \nPart of the act is also the \"Volcker Rule\", named after former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, which restricts US banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments, including investing in hedge and private equity funds, using their own money or customer deposits — so called proprietary trading. \nBanks with assets of $50 billion or more also have to have a pre-packaged bankruptcy plan that guides their dissolution and liquidation without taxpayer assistance if they were to collapse. Who are Dodd and Frank? \nThe act is named after former Democratic lawmakers Senator Chris Dodd and Representative Barney Frank. \nOne of the bill's key architects, Mr Frank, explained the law while in Australia last year: \n\"Under our law the Federal Reserve may pay some of the debt as much as needed to prevent this from spiralling downwards. \n\"But only after they have dissolved the institution, that is no bank is too big to fail, there are banks that are too big to be allowed to fail without some attention to their indebtedness.\" What are President Trump's plans? \nRepublican lawmakers have argued that Dodd-Frank is burdensome for financial institutions. \nMr Trump told business leaders — including top Wall Street banking executives, such as JP Morgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon — that he expects \"to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank\". \n\"I have so many friends, friends of mine, that have nice business that can't borrow money ... because the banks just won't let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank,\" Mr Trump said. \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters last week that \"Dodd-Frank is a disastrous policy that's hindering our markets\". \nThe Treasury Secretary set to conduct the review is Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker, who is awaiting confirmation by the Senate. \nUntil Mr Mnuchin is confirmed, the director of the National Economic Council, Gary Cohn, holds one of the most influential White House financial posts, and was the chief spokesman for Mr Trump's banking plans. \nMr Cohn left Goldman Sachs just over a month ago, and was the investment bank's chief operating officer and second-in-charge. \nDemocrats have said Mr Trump's order lacks substance and aligns him with Wall Street bankers. What kind of things are on the chopping block? \nAspects that could be repealed or wound back include: The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has cracked down on mortgage lending, credit cards and pay day loans Richard Cordray, the CFPB's director, who Republican senators are pushing Mr Trump to fire The Volcker Rule, which limits the trading positions banks can take on their own behalf and limits the potential losses when markets go south, but also crimps banks' potential profits Extra monitoring and reporting for \"systemically important institutions\" — ie, the biggest banks and insurers Living wills for banks — the biggest institutions need orderly wind-up plans in the event of failure A less well known Labor Department rule that requires brokers to act in their client's best interest when providing financial advice What has the reaction been? \nWall Street is ecstatic, with the financial sector index climbing 2 per cent on Friday. Banks have rallied 25 per cent since Mr Trump's election win, adding $US460 billion ($600 billion) to their market value. \nConsumer groups, meanwhile, are horrified and Mr Trump will have to watch out for a backlash from some of his base, as financial regulation was very popular following the home foreclosures during the sub-prime mortgage crisis and the President campaigned on an anti-Wall Street platform. \nIt is likely that, if the Dodd-Frank act is emasculated, shares in Australian banks will rally. \nAlready, on news of Mr Trump's initial moves to unwind the law, local banks have made substantial gains. Three of the big four banks have climbed more than 1 per cent each, while ANZ had lifted 0.7 per cent by 12:33pm (AEDT).
