Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has proposed a bill to call for declaring the Brotherhood a terror organization. In the past, it has been accused of supporting terrorist groups around the world, and several countries, including Muslim nations, have banned them. \nIf the U.S. declares the Brotherhood a terrorist organization, it would make it a criminal act for Americans to fund the group, ban banks from processing money for it, bar people with ties to the group from coming to the United States and make it easier to deport immigrants who have worked with the organization. \n“It is time to call this enemy by its name and speak with clarity and moral authority,” Cruz said in a statement introducing the bill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:17:52.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
