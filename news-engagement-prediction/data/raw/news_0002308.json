Moon Time Sisters member Nicole White said they don't work for all women, so the group is collecting donations of all types of menstrual supplies.\n\"I think folks see this as a simple, productive way to support our young women in the north,\" said White. \"I worked in non-profit for many years, so I know feminine hygiene products are a luxury for women and I want to do what I can to support young women.\"\nNicole White is helping to organize an effort to send much needed menstrual supplies to high school girls in northern Saskatchewan. (CBC)\nWhite said that the immediate goal for the Moon Time Sisters is to put together five care packages that can be sent to five different northern communities, with an emphasis of reaching high school girls.\n\"Some of those communities don't even have convenience stores and as women, we've all been there in a pinch when we need that corner store.\"\nThe group does, however, have a much larger goal in mind. White said it would like to develop a system to support girls for as long as there is a need.\n\"We are trying to actually get some commercial suppliers so there is going to be sustainable access [for] these communities,\" she said.\nWith files from CBC Radio's Saskatoon Morning", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/groups/344898739244000/"], "published": "2017-02-01T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:47:49.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
