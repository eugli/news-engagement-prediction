The ‘Logan’ star dropped a snap on his Instagram page sporting a plaster on his nose, following a procedure to remove the cancer. “Another basal cell carcinoma,” he captioned while still at the doctor’s surgery. “Thanks to frequent body checks and amazing doctors, all is well. Looks worse with the dressing on than off. I swear! #wearsunscreen.” This is the fifth time that the 48-year-old actor has been treated for skin cancers, since he had a spot removed from his shoulder in 2013. He blames the recurrences on too much exposure to the sun when he was growing up in Australia. Since then, he’s always documented his procedures in a bid to encourage fans to be vigilant over skin cancers. Speaking to People magazine in 2015, he said: “It’s always a bit of a shock just hearing the word ‘cancer’. “Being an Australian, it’s a very common thing. I never wore sunscreen growing up, so I was a prime candidate for it. “I go every three months for check-ups. It’s the new normal for me. My doctor says I’ll likely have more, and if that’s your cross to bear in life, you should be so lucky.” More than 10,000 cases of skin cancer are diagnosed every year in the UK, but in the US, the number is around three million per year.
