Getty Images 3 Adele laid down in no uncertain terms that she ‘didn’t love’ her father \nInstead, she took the opportunity to praise her long-time manager Jonathan Dickins for his help in creating the multi-award winning album 25 – and compared him to the father she wished she had. \nShe told the audience: “Thank you to my manager because the comeback, as it were, was completely masterminded by him. And you executed it incredibly, and I owe you everything. We’ve been together for 10 years, and I love you like you’re my dad.” Getty Images 3 The singer spent the evening gushing over her ‘husband’ Simon Konecki \nThe star then made the pointed remark and added: “I love you so, so much. I don’t love my dad, that’s the thing. That doesn’t mean a lot. I love you like I would love my dad.” \nAdele’s frosty relationship with her alcoholic father, Marc Evans, has been long documented, after he left her and her mum when she was just three years old. \nIn 2011, he exclusively spoke to The Sun and by his own words revealed his drinking ‘made Oliver Reed look like a teetotaller’. \n\nHe said: “I was a rotten father at a time when she really needed me. \n“I was putting away two litres of vodka and seven or eight pints of Stella every day. \n“I drank like that for three years. God only knows how I survived it. I was deeply ashamed of what I’d become and I knew the kindest thing I could do for Adele was to make sure she never saw me in that state.” Adele tears up as she wins Album of the Year at the Grammys \nHowever, he claimed at the time that the pair had healed their wounds, and that they had started establishing regular contact. \nIt was thought that following a cancer scare in 2015 they had patched things up further - though Adele's new remarks seem to suggest that the bond didn't last.
