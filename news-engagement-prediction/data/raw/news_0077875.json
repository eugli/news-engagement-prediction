Credit Ross Mantle for The New York Times Juliet Evancho, a transgender woman whose sister performed at President Trump’s inauguration, scored a temporary legal victory on Monday when a federal judge ruled that she and two other transgender students at a Pennsylvania high school must be given access to restrooms corresponding to their gender identity. In his ruling, Judge Mark R. Hornak, of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, concluded that the three students had a “reasonable likelihood” of success in arguing that the Pine-Richland School District’s decision last fall to bar them from using those bathrooms was unconstitutional. As a result, he granted a preliminary injunction that they had sought against the policy. “The ruling is a reminder to school districts across Pennsylvania and across America that they have a legal duty to respect the gender identity of all their students,” said Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, a lawyer with Lambda Legal, the nonprofit civil rights group that is representing the three students. The decision came amid renewed national focus on transgender rights. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump rescinded rules allowing transgender students access to bathrooms in line with their gender identity, prompting a strong response from advocates. Among them was Ms. Evancho’s sister, Jackie, who had performed at the inauguration. “I am obviously disappointed,” she said in one Twitter post. In another, she asked Mr. Trump to meet with her sister. On Thursday, his press secretary, Sean Spicer, said the president “would be welcome to meet with her.” . @realDonaldTrump u gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration. Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts ❤ — jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) Feb. 23, 2017 Ms. Evancho, 18, is joined in the suit by Elissa Ridenour, a fellow 18-year-old transgender woman, and a transgender boy who is a minor, Judge Hornak said in the ruling. All three are seniors at Pine-Richland High School in Gibsonia, Pa., and all three have received hormone treatment or therapy. School officials had for some time embraced each student by their gender identity. But early last year, apparently encouraged by a parent, the district superintendent addressed the issue with the whole school community for the first time, according to the ruling. \nAdvertisement After months of discussions, the school board voted in September to reverse the informal policy on bathroom use, limiting the three students to single-user bathrooms or those that do not match their gender identities.
