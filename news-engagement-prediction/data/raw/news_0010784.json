They have pleaded not guilty. \nNews24 previously reported the charges against them stem from the alleged extreme lengths that Mdluli went to between 1997 and 1999 to find out where Buthelezi and Ramogibe were hiding. \nAt his last court appearance, Mdluli claimed that a project was put together to falsely prosecute him. \nHe testified during cross examination there were senior people who were part of a project, Ulibambe Lingashoni, set up to advance their agenda against him. \nHe also said witnesses were found and put in witness protection \"in order to coach them to falsely prosecute me\". \n'Secret marriage' \nMdluli said he paid lobola for Buthelezi and regarded her as his wife, but later heard that Buthelezi and Ramogibe had had a \"secret marriage\". \nMdluli had a long-term relationship with Buthelezi from his school days, but during her relationship with the former crime intelligence boss she met Ramogibe and they began a relationship. They married on July 22, 1998. \nRamogibe allegedly received death threats after marrying Buthelezi and was told to leave her or he would be killed. He opened an attempted murder case before his death. \nRamogibe was shot and killed and no one had been convicted of his murder. Charges of murder against Mdluli and his co-accused were withdrawn \nAt the time, Mdluli was the station commander at the Vosloorus police station in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, and was accused of sabotaging the investigation.
