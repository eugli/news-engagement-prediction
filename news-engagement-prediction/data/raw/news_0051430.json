'Another reason could have been competitive dominance. It's possible the worm evolved to be bigger than its rivals so it could get the most food.' 'We've only found one set of fossils so it's difficult to tell how long they were around for or when they went extinct.' Despite only discovering the jaws of the beast, the researchers were able to work out how the animal might have behaved by studying its closest relatives. The researchers conducted a 3D reconstruction of parts of the jaw apparatus of the animal, pictured, from CT scanning of the fossil specimens The jaws of the new species were found at the bottom of Hudson Bay near Ontario, Canada in 1995 before going on show at the Royal Ontario Museum The new species is related to the 'giant eunicid' worm, nicknamed the bobbit worm, a fearsome and opportunistic ambush predators who use their powerful jaws to capture prey such as fish and cephalopods (squids and octopuses). Mr Parry said: 'Bobbit worms sit in burrows at the bottom of the sea and use their sensory appendages to monitor what food is going by. 'When they sense prey is near, they snatch it up and pull it into their burrow.' The new species is unique among fossil worms and possessed the largest jaws ever recorded in this type of creature, reaching over one centimetre (less than half an inch) in length and easily visible to the naked eye. Lead author Mats Eriksson from Lund University said: 'Gigantism in animals is an alluring and ecologically important trait, usually associated with advantages and competitive dominance. 'It is, however, a poorly understood phenomenon among marine worms and has never before been demonstrated in a fossil species. The new species is closely related to the iridescent Eunice aphroditois, nicknamed the bobbit worm, pictured, which catches ambushes prey using its razor-sharp mandibles 'The new species demonstrates a unique case of polychaete gigantism in the Palaeozoic, some 400 million years ago.' The specimens were collected over a few hours in a single day in June 1994, when Derek K Armstrong of Ontario Geological Survey was dropped by helicopter to investigate the rocks and fossils at a remote and temporary exposure in Ontario. Sample materials from the Devonian Kwataboahegan Formation were brought back to the Royal Ontario Museum, where they have been stored ever since. David Rudkin, from the Royal Ontario Museum, said: 'This is an excellent example of the importance of looking in remote and unexplored areas for finding new exciting things, but also the importance of scrutinising museum collections for overlooked gems.' The findings were published today in Scientific Reports.
