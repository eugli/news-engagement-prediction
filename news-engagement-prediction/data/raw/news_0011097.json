Photo: Pool/Getty Images What, with the absolutely polite reception Stephen Colbert got while hosting the 2006 White House Correspondents’ Dinner and eviscerating George W. Bush in the process, of course he’s jumping to do it again.

I mean, when else are you going to stand next to the President and make jokes?,” he explained. Of course, Colbert may have found a slight dash in his dream: After that first go-round, “no one will ever ask again.” Right, darn.
