Present was Mentri Besar Datuk Seri Mohamed Khaled Nordin.\nTunku Ismail was representing his father, Sultan of Johor Sultan Ibrahim Ibni Almarhum Sultan Iskandar, who attended the celebration at the Murugan Temple in Simpang Renggam last year.\nTunku Ismail stayed an hour for lunch, during which time he was entertained with cultural performances. \nHousewife S. Jeya, 29, said she arrived at the temple early with her family to pray and seek blessings as well as to witness the royal couple’s arrival. \n“I have been coming here for Thaipusam for the past five years, and this time it is much grander with the royal family’s presence,” she said. \nSales representative R. Ravin, 30, who managed to shake hands with Tunku Ismail, described him as a friendly man.\n“I even wished him luck in running for the Football Association of Malaysia presidency,” he added.\nThanking the royal family, Johor Unity and Human Resources Committee chairman R. Vidyanathan said their attendance was in true Bangsa Johor spirit.\nAt Jalan Kuel, best friends Wen Yee and Jia Min, both 22, were among those who turned up for the celebration at the Arulmigu Thendayuthapani Temple. \nThe college students woke up early to see the devotees fulfil their vows. \nWen, who is on semester break from her university in Taiwan where she is studying environmental science, said she was eager to see the rituals. \n“Usually, we would only watch the celebration on television but since my friend and I were free, we decided to visit the temple,” she said.\nWen said she wanted to do something meaningful and different before leaving again for Taiwan next week. \nJia, who is studying law, said being a Buddhist did not hold her back from learning about other religions and cultures. \n“It was a great experience because we got to meet new people, watch them carry silver pots of milk and fulfil their vows.\n“We also enjoyed the food sold at the stalls nearby,” she said, adding that they tried snacks like vadai and spicy muruku . \nMohamed Khaled said the state government agreed to give RM50,000 to the Arulmigu Thendayuthapani Temple for its annual activities, especially in helping the needy and for its educational programmes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:47:27.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
