Why is Nagpur deprived of Oscar nominated films? Eight out of nine Hollywood movies nominated for the 89th Academy Awards were not released in the city... | Feb 5, 2017, 10.07 PM IST The world will eagerly watch the Oscars live on February 26 and root for Academy Award nominated films, including Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone starrer 'La La Land', 'Fences' and 'Hidden Figures' among others. But one thing that will really perturb the movie lovers of Nagpur on that particular day is â€” that except for one, almost all these films have not been released in the city till date. We find out the reasons why most of the critically acclaimed English films are not released here. Not commercially viable Nagpur has five multiplexes and several single screen theatres. While they prefer to screen blockbusters like 'Suicide Squad', with action and special effects, distributors think twice before releasing the kind of films that usually go to the Oscars. Film distributor Mario Fernandez explains, \"We have tested and experimented with the Nagpur market by releasing an Oscar nominated film of 2016, Spotlight. But the audiences here prefer to watch latest Bollywood films or sci-fi and action-packed English movies over serious cinema. Hence these movies are not considered commercially viable in smaller cities like Nagpur. Interestingly, movies like La La Land , Lion, and Arrival, which have been nominated for the Academy Awards, have done quite well in cities like Mumbai, Pune, Delhi and Bangalore.\" Validating this fact, Rashmikant Kandharkar of a city multiplex adds, \"From April 2016 to January 31 this year, we have screened over 30 Hollywood films, including Arrival, but the total occupancy of cinegoers in these months was just six per cent, which is quite less compared to Bollywood films and action or sci-fi English films.\" Film buffs disappointed Avid movie lovers in the city who like to experiment with wider genres of cinema, rue the fact that Oscar nominated movies always release late in the city. \"Many Oscar nominated films first get released in cinemas across the metro cities and not here in Nagpur,\" says city-based filmmaker Piyush Pande and adds, \"All my friends in the metros have watched 'La La Land', but I didn't get to watch the film here in the city since it never released here. Frankly speaking, I don't have patience to wait for these films to release in multiplexes, hence I have subscribed for an online movie site wherein I get to download all the latest films on my computer. If the film is not available online, I wait for the DVD release, which is anytime better than waiting for the films to release on big screens in the city.\" Celebrating the Oscar week While the aspect of commercial viability keeps distributors away from screening critically acclaimed Oscar nominated films in the city, in a first of its kind experiment, a popular multiplex chain will screen Oscar nominated films in the city soon. CEO of a multiplex chain Kamal Gianchandani shares, \"We will screen the Academy Awards nominated films in our multiplex in Nagpur from February 15 to February 26 as a part of our Oscar week celebration. We want that audiences in small cities like Nagpur must get an opportunity to watch quality cinema too.\" Admitting that these films don't find the niche audience in the city, Gianchandani adds, \"I believe that markets grow as we continue experimenting. Audiences like many options in entertainment and I am sure that there are movie lovers in the city who appreciate and wait for such films to release on big screen.\" City Needs exposure Actor of national award winning film 'Court', Vira Sathidar , whose film was selected as India's official entry for the 88th Academy Awards, says Nagpur has a lot of scope for serious cinema, but they need more exposure. \"Unlike metro cities, Nagpur has always been deprived of quality cinema and this is the reason why people don't have a taste for unconventional films here. If film distributors stop worrying about the market and start screening all kinds of films, audience here will be able to broaden their perspective and will learn to appreciate cinema as an art form.\" Academy Awards nominations", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T19:00:11.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
