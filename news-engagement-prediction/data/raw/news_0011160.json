In corresponding roster moves, St. Louis recalled Magnus Paajarvi and Kenny Agostino from Chicago of the American Hockey League.\nFabbri was checked into the boards by Pittsburgh's Carter Rowney during the first period Saturday night and went to the ice. Fabbri put no pressure on his left leg as he left.\nThe long-term injury is another blow to the Blues, who have lost six of their past eight games to fall out of a playoff position in the Western Conference and fired coach Ken Hitchcock last week. The 21-year-old Fabbri had 11 goals and 18 assists for 29 points in 51 games this season.\nFabbri, a first-round pick in 2014, was just eight points short of matching his total from last year, his rookie season. It's another devastating injury for Fabbri, who had a high-ankle sprain during the 2015 world junior tournament. Paajarvi and Agostino were recalled for the first time this season. Agostino leads the AHL with 60 points in 48 games.\nÂ© The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-05T21:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:20:08.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
