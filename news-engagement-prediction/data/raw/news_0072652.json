The last time I saw the police form a skirmish line like that was seven years ago, it was similar issues â€¦ it was an absolute mess.\" \nHe said there were about 20-30 Lawrenson Group staff who worked with police to clear the street by 3am. \n\"This is not an alcohol-related harm incident, this is a gang violence issue.\" \nInspector Karen Henrikson said it was the first time in years she had seen any incident of this scale in central Hamilton. \nThere were 42 arrests during the night in the CBD. \nShe was unsure how many of those arrests had been made earlier in the night but says it was higher than police were expecting. \nShe was reluctant to call it a brawl. She said it was \"pockets of disorder\". \n\"This one-off incident is really disappointing. We will certainly be following up with those involved, unravelling what has happened and initiate other efforts to reduce any opportunity for this to happen again.\" \nDespite the incident occurring at the end of O Week celebrations, she said it had nothing to do with the event. \nIn March 2014, there were 86 reported offences in the city during O Week. Since then there has been an effort to reduce the number of offences. \nPolice had increased presence in the CBD to manage crowds. \nThere was also a safe zone on Victoria St to assist. \nThe safe zone was a multi-agency initiative, it was brightly lit and manned by police, paramedics and Waikato Student Union volunteers. It was set up by the city's CBD Safety Comes First group to help curb the disorder that spikes during O Week. \n\"We will be debriefing the incident to determine if we could have done things better.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:36:01.074+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
