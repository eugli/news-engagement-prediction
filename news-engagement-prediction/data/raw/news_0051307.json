So he hasn’t been able to quit the role cold turkey. \n“I’m uncomfortable saying goodbye,” he admitted. \nWhen asked if he was confident that this would remain his final portrayal of Wolverine—a point that has been hammered down since before the film was even conceived—Jackman was adamant. \n“When I had the script, I was like, ‘Yes.’ And when I was shooting the movie, yes,” Jackman said. “As I sit here today, yes. God knows how I’ll feel in three years. But right now, absolutely.” \nJackman also admitted that though he often fears whether he gave enough, that his portrayal was good enough, on many of his performances, something felt right about this one. \n“There’s been a gnawing turmoil that I hadn’t really nailed it, fully — either story or performance or whatever. Every film I’ve ever done, I’ve had that gnawing doubt. But I have it way less in this one.” \nIf early reviews are any indication , the audience will agree whole heartedly. Logan currently the 4th Most Anticipated Film in our Movie Database based on rankings from ComicBook readers.
