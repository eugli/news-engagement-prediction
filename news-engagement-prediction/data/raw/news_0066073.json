Four known rabbit caliciviruses in Australia RHDV1: escaped from quarantine on Wardang Island, SA in 1995, and officially released following year. Killed up to 90 per cent of rabbit population. Benign calicivirus: not known how long it has been in Australia. Does not kill rabbits but enables immunity against other caliciviruses. More common in cool, wet districts. RHDV2: first identified in ACT in 2016. Not known how it came to Australia. Current vaccine doesn't protect against it. RHDV-K5: Korean strain, to be released nationally next week \nIt will be the first time in more than 20 years that a new rabbit biocontrol agent has been launched in Australia. \nAfter a decade of testing and research through the Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre RHD Boost project, K5 will be released at more 600 sites covering all states and territories. \nThe researchers expect this newest biological control will reduce the overall rabbit population by about 20 per cent. \n\"It's not a silver bullet,\" said Dr Tarnya Cox, who is employed by NSW Department of Primary Industries and heads up the RHD Boost Project. \nShe said the virus was expected to be more successful at eradicating rabbits in the cool, wet regions of the country â€” the districts where the original calicivirus released in 1996, did not work so well. \n\"From a welfare perspective, it is a haemorrhagic disease so there is that concern, but this strain kills rabbits faster than what we already have,\" she said. \n\"We want to make sure that whatever we are using is humane and acts as quickly as possible, so that's why we have also chosen K5, because it's fast.\" \nLand managers in many regions have been doing spotlight rabbit counts so they can compare rabbit populations before and after the virus release.

(Landline: Prue Adams) \nThey have also been laying out carrot and oat baits in a bid to \"train\" the wild rabbits to accept similar virus-laced baits next week. \nIn the week following the release, land managers will be required to check for dead rabbits, take tissue samples to be analysed for cause of death, and log some of their results on a new mobile app called Rabbit Scan. \nThe release of this latest strain of virus is complicated by the prevalence of another strain of calicivirus, known as RHDV2; endemic to Europe, RHDV2 found its way to Australia early last year, and has now reached Canada and Africa. \nIt has been killing rabbits and hares all across Australia. Photo: Land managers collect blood and tissue samples from rabbits during a spotlight count. (Landline: Prue Adams) \nIt is not known how the mystery appearance of this virus will impact the intentional release of RHD-K5 next week. \nOwners of pet and show rabbits have been urged to vaccinate their animals as the current vaccine administered by vets is said to protect most rabbits against K5. \nThere is no vaccine available in Australia for the RHDV2. \nRabbits are Australia's worst vertebrate pest species, causing up to $200 million in lost agricultural production annually and contributing to the destruction of native vegetation. \nFor more on the virus release see Landline this Sunday at 12 noon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:05:11.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
