Both teams also had four extra-base hits. . .LSU pitchers struck out 15 batters. . .Maryland stranded 11 runners – five in scoring position. The Terps were 3-for-9 with runners in scoring position. . .Maryland committed two errors in the third inning when the Tigers scored five unearned runs. . .The Terrapins registered two double plays. . .LSU committed one error – a bobble by Duplantis in centerfield. \nINDIVIDUAL STAT LEADERS \nCole Freeman: 3-for-3, 1 RBI, 1 run scored \nJosh Smith: 2-for-3, 2 RBIs, 1 run scored, 1 double \nKramer Robertson: 2-for-5, 2 runs scored, 1 RBI, 1 double \nGreg Deichmann: 1-for-3, 3 runs scored, 2 RBIs, 1 home run \nMichael Papierski: 1-for-3, 2 RBIs \nRankin Woley: 1-for-4, 2 runs scored, 1 RBI, 1 double \nEric Walker: 4 innings, 7 hits, 3 runs, 3 earned runs, 2 walks, 6 strikeouts \nMARYLAND \nMarty Costes: 3-for-5, 1 RBI, 1 run scored \nZach Jancarski: 2-for-3, 1 RBI, 1 run scored, 1 double, 1 home run \nWill Watson: 1-for-4, 2 RBIs, 1 run scored, 1 home run \nTyler Blohm: 2.1 innings, 4 hits, 5 runs, 2 earned runs, 4 walks, 2 strikeouts \nLSU’S PLAYER OF THE GAME \nDeichmann hit a two-run homer in the bottom of the fourth to put the Tigers comfortably ahead 9-3. But, Deichmann had just as meaningful a defensive play in the seventh. Nickens singled with the bases loaded driving in one run. Deichmann prevented a second run from scoring by throwing out Costes at the plate. If Costes would have scored, the LSU lead would have been down to three runs at 9-6. Deichmann’s only hit was the home run. However, he drew two walks and finished with three runs scored – tying his career-high. He scored three runs against Missouri last season. \nDeichmann’s comments: “Coach (Paul) Mainieri talked about the play after the inning. It was a unique play since there were two outs and a 3-2 count. He told me that it was a risky play and that I had more time to throw the guy out at third base. I saw (Costes) only one step beyond third when I got to the ball. I thought I had a good shot at him. That throw killed their rally and took some momentum away from them. The home run was on a 3-1 fast ball the pitcher left over the middle of the plate.” \nNOTES \nWoley got a second straight as the designated hitter. With a lefthanded pitcher starting for Maryland, Jordan was the starting leftfielder. . .Deichmann has four home runs in LSU’s eight games. His fourth homer last season came in the Tigers’ 25th game on Apr. 2 at Auburn. Deichmann’s homer carried 451 feet. He hit a 486-foot homer against Hofstra last Wednesday. . .Slaughter has a hit in all eight of LSU’s games. Robertson has a hit in every Tigers game except the opener against Army. Papierski extended his hitting streak to six games. . .Freeman tied his career-high with three hits. Freeman has collected three hits in a game five times in his career. . .The Tigers struck out eight times with seven coming from the three hitters in the middle of the lineup – three for Robertson and two for both Deichmann and Slaughter. . .Walker had a rocky outing as he was lifted after four innings. Walker did escape two big jams. He struck out Watson with two runners on base to end the third and retired Dunn on a fly out to rightfield with the bases loaded to end the fourth. . .Caleb Gilbert struck out all six batters he faced in his two innings. The six strikeouts are a career-best for Gilbert, who picked up the victory since Walker did not go five innings. . .Doug Norman left the game with an apparent elbow injury after issuing a two-out walk which loaded the bases. Norman allowed one run and three hits. . .Hunter Kiel got two outs in the eighth. . .Nick Bush walked three batters in the eighth before Hunter Newman came on to get a four-out save. . .Maryland had hit one home run in its first five games. Then, the Terps hit two homers in the first inning off Walker. . .The Tigers have swept seven straight three-game series against non-conference power-league opponents – Wake Forest in 2011, Maryland and Washington in 2013, Purdue in 2014, Kansas and Boston College in 2015 and Maryland in 2017. . .For the fourth time in the last five seasons, LSU has won seven of its first eight games. . .Maryland is 1-5. . .The paid attendance was 10,221. The actual crowd was about 5,200. . .Zack Hess will be the starting pitcher for the Tigers against Nicholls State on Tuesday. \nFROM THE LOCKER ROOM \nCoach Paul Mainieri’s comments: “There were some really good things that happened today. Eric Walker showed a lot of character. He didn’t give up after allowing two home runs in the first inning. He then gave us three shutout innings. Caleb Gilbert was really outstanding. He was throwing 95 or 96 miles per hour and struck out all six batters he faced. Then, it was good for us to have to fight back from a deficit. We tied the game up and got some clutch hits. I like the way we are swinging the bats. We have a very mature approach even though we have three freshmen in the lineup. I like the way (hitting coach) Micah Gibbs is doing things.” \nUP NEXT \nLSU will play host to Nicholls State at The Box on Tuesday. First pitch is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Central. The Colonels (4-3) won two of three games at the Mardi Gras Invitational in Thibodaux over the weekend. Nicholls beat Long Island and Wagner and lost to Hofstra. The LSU-Nicholls State game will be available on the SEC Digital Network.
