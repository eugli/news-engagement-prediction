A South Korean military official told Reuters the military would begin installing fences and soldiers would patrol the area.\nThe Lotte Group said on Feb. 8 Chinese authorities had stopped construction at a multi-billion dollar real estate project in China after a fire inspection, adding to concern in South Korea about damage to commercial relations with the world's second-largest economy.\nAsked if South Korea had demanded the Chinese government suspend any economic retaliation, South Korean Defence Ministry spokesman Moon Sang-kyun said: \"We have continuously persuaded China so far and will keep continuing efforts to do so.\"\nSouth Korean government officials have said THAAD is a defensive measure against North Korean threats and does not target any other country. \nSouth Korea's central bank said this month the number of Chinese tourists visiting the tourist island of Jeju had fallen 6.7 percent over the Lunar New Year holiday from last year, partly because of China's \"anti-South Korea measures due to the THAAD deployment decision\".\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Additional reporting by Ju-min Park in SEOUL; Editing by Paul Tait)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:49:58.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
