(The Dallas Morning News) By David Moore , Staff Writer Contact David Moore on Twitter: @DavidMooreDMN \nThe Cowboys are acknowledged as the team of the 1990s. \nThe group that got it all started will reunite in three-and-a-half weeks. \nTroy Aikman will host a celebration on Feb. 25 for the team that beat Buffalo 52-17 in Super Bowl XXVII. The Hall of Fame quarterback said the teams that won two of the next three titles to cement the Cowboys' claim as the Team of the Decade also will be recognized. \nThe reunion marks the first time this group has gotten together since it won the title 24 years ago. \n\"I'm really excited about it,\" Aikman said. \"I keep up with all of them as best as I can. Like all of us, as we get older, it becomes harder and harder to do. \n\"This will be a great night. It will be a great celebration.\" \nAikman said everyone who was a part of the organization has been invited. He ran off the list of players and coaches who will attend. \nIt all starts with former head coach Jimmy Johnson. Flashback: Relive the Cowboys' 52-17 blowout of the Bills in Super Bowl XXVIIÃ‚ \n\"I get a chance to see Jimmy a few times a year, with him at Fox, and I get back down there to the (Florida) Keys and spend a few days with him each year,\" Aikman said. \"But for a lot of these guys they haven't seen him since the day he walked out of the building. \n\"He is the one guy who I said, 'Hey, I'm going to have this reunion event and you have to come. You're the one guy that this whole event is dependent on.'\" \nJohnson walked away from the Cowboys in March of '94, two months after the team won its second consecutive trophy. \n\"Sometimes it's hard for me to go back to Dallas because it's hard for me to go out in public, to be honest with you,\" Johnson said. \"But Troy said, 'Those guys want to see you. They haven't seen you since we won the Super Bowl the last time.' So I agreed. \n\"I'm looking forward to seeing them.\" \nWhy now? Aikman was struck by how many of his teammates from that first championship team were disappointed that there had not been a reunion to give them a chance to see each other and celebrate their accomplishments. \n\"I said, 'Hey, I'll get it done,'\" Aikman said. \nHe did. \nAnd he landed the biggest fish of all to pull it off. \n\"I'm not much for hooplas,\" Johnson conceded. \"But (Aikman) said, 'Hey, we'll have a little something here for United Way but then we'll have a private session with you and the guys.' That's what I'm looking forward to. \n\"I'm going there for them.\" -- Listen live to Sportsradio The Ticket 1310am/96.7fm and rewind and pause up to 1 hour -- Free access to breaking news, analysis, podcasts and more New Android version soon!
