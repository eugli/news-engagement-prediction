Key points: Scientists sequence genome of Australian pitcher plant to reveal which genes are involved with digestive fluids Comparing with other species reveals genetic make-up of digestive enzymes is very similar Finding suggests all plants took the same evolutionary route towards becoming predators \nThe plants became flesh-eaters as a means of making their own \"fertiliser\". \nFindings published today in Nature Ecology and Evolution show while the three species evolved independently in different parts of the world over time, the biological processes they use to digest insects are incredibly alike. \nCo-author Victor Albert, from Buffalo University, said the finding suggested there were limited evolutionary pathways by which plants could develop flesh-eating traits. \nCarnivorous plants grow in very nutrient-poor habitats and produce carbon through the usual photosynthetic processes, just like other plants. \nHowever, Dr Albert said, because their habitats failed to provide enough phosphorus and nitrogen, nature's equivalent of \"fertiliser\", they had to develop unusual ways to collect these nutrients. \n\"The animals [they prey on] have this in abundance in the form of the proteins and nucleic acids that are released when the plant digests them,\" he said. Australian pitcher plant genome provides clues \nPitcher plants capture insects by luring them into a trap — a cupped leaf with a waxy, slippery interior that makes it difficult to climb out. A \"soup\" of digestive fluids sits at the bottom of this chamber and breaks down the flesh and exoskeletons of prey. \nTo better understand how these flesh-eating plants evolved, Dr Albert and colleagues mapped the genome of Cephalotus follicularis , a pitcher plant that is native to south-west Australia and closely related to star fruit. \n\"Cephalotus was a great plant to study because the plants bear two different kinds of leaves, one being the flat leaves, specialised for light gathering as in other plants, and the other being the elaborate pitchers used by the plants to capture prey,\" Dr Albert said. \nBy mapping its genome the team was able to uncover which genes were expressed only in pitcher leaves, and those related to photosynthetic leaves, or both. \n\"In this way, we were able to discern that several genes encoding digestive enzymes were preferentially expressed in [the pitcher plant] traps,\" he said.

(Flickr: I-saint) \nIn other words, some of the critical enzymes evolved entirely separately, in different places and lineages. \nThese included chitinase, which breaks down chitin — the major component of insects' exoskeletons — and purple acid phosphatase, which enables plants to obtain phosphorus from its prey's body parts. \nDr Albert said the finding was an example of \"nested convergence\" — convergent evolution at several hierarchical levels. \nThese were morphological (pitchers are very similar yet develop totally differently in the three pitcher plant groups); genetic (convergent use of the same or similar enzyme groups); and molecular (amino acids show some convergent changes only in the carnivores). \n\"These plants have a genetic tool kit, and they're trying to come up with an answer to the problem of how to become carnivorous. And in the end, they all come up with the same solution,\" Dr Albert said.
