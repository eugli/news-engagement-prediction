The Time Group is planning to renovate the site at 3100-3200 Falls Cliff Road just off Interstate 83 and turn it into apartments. The building will eventually hold between 90 and 95 units, along with 10,000 square feet of space for artists, said Dominic Wiker , director of development for the Time Group. A manufacturing facility at 3100 Falls Cliff Rd. will be converted into between 90 and 95… more Courtesy of the Time Group Developers received approval by the city's Planning Commission for a planned-unit development on the site, as well as a change in zoning from industrial to mixed-use industrial. The approval means construction can start on the building this summer. Renovations will take between 12 and 14 months to complete, Wiker said. Wiker said rental rates are not set for the apartments or the artist space, but said the apartments would be similar to other rental rates in Hampden. The addition of the space for artists on the first floor will add \"personality\" to the building, Wiker said. \"We had such a great response from people who were really creative and needed a well-apportioned space that they can just kind of plug in,\" he said. Other upgrades to the building include cleaning the building's the facade, installing new windows and renovating a sign on the property that will identify the apartment complex. The project is a collaboration between Baltimore-based Time Group and the family of the late Doug Fox , the founder of Fox Industries. The 130,000-square-foot building started as a manufacturing facility for Noxzema, the famed skin cream made by pharmacist George Bunting, and was eventually taken over by Fox Industries, a maker of epoxies and sealants, in 1969. Fox Industries was acquired by Pleasanton, Calif.-based Simpson Strong Tie Co. in 2011. Simpson Strong Tie continues to occupy the building, but is in the process of moving to a new facility in Illinois and will be out by the end of the year, Wiker said. The 2.9-acre property is still owned by the Fox family, state property records show. The apartment building will be the Time Group's fifth in the city. In Mount Vernon, it recently opened 520 Park, a $32 million renovation of the former Hochschild Kohn warehouse, and is currently working on a sister apartment building at 500 Park Ave. Jonathan Munshaw is the digital editor of the Baltimore Business Journal.
