External Link: Lightning map around Sydney \n\"It's a result of that large lightening storm that came through so quickly this afternoon.\" \nMr O'Brien said the lightning strikes caused damage to infrastructure, and crews were working to fix the problem. \nEarlier in Sydney winds of up to 93 kilometres per hour winds were recorded at Horsley Park in Sydney's west, and hail battered parts of Penrith. \nA severe thunderstorm warning was still in place for areas around Gosford and Wyong, with Newcastle, Wollongong, Bowral, Orange, Mudgee, Bathurst and Katoomba also affected. \n\"The storms have now moved across to the Lower Hunter and the Central Coast,\" the BOM's Rob Taggart said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T09:49:12.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
