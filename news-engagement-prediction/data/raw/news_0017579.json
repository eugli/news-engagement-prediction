Dubai Airports continues to use technology to improve service and boost capacity as part of its DXB Plus programme designed to elevate capacity at Dubai International (DXB) to 118 million by 2023. The latest innovation takes the form of an Intelligent Traffic System (ITS), which optimises the coordination of buses used to shuttle passengers from Terminal 2 departure gates to the aircraft. \"It is another world first for DXB. It is the first time this technology has been implemented and used in this manner,\" said Bryan Thompson, Senior Vice President - Development at Dubai Airports. \"The system is fail-safe, and provides a fully automated solution to coordinate bus scheduling which in turn reduces wait times for departing passengers.\" The new system improves efficiency by ensuring buses are fully utilised increasing the average number of passengers per bus trip from 40 to over 60. It reduces the number of bus trips by 20 per cent which in turn limits fuel burn and emissions. And it alleviates congestion during peak operations. \"DXB Plus initiatives are in line with smart government and proof that technology can be applied to many parts of our business to improve the passenger experience, boost efficiency and help us augment capacity,\" said Thompson.
