Trump is under pressure to reject or change the deal as he attempts to temporarily halt refugee arrivals and ban immigration from several Muslim-majority countries. Turnbull, for his part, has been attempting to secure reassurance that Trump will honor the deal, signed by the Barack Obama administration. Sources told CNN Trump described the agreements as \"a very bad deal\" and complained that Australia was trying to send \"the next Boston bomber\" to the US. What is the deal? Under the arrangement, agreed by Obama and Turnbull in November within days of Trump's election, Australia would transfer 1,250 refugees currently held in offshore detention centers on the Pacific Island nation of Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island to the US. Read More The transfer would be administered by the UN High Commission on Refugees. Only those refugees in the centers at the time the deal was announced would be eligible. In November, Turnbull said it was a \"one-off agreement (that) will not be repeated.\" Australia to send refugees to the US: Why it took so long Who are the refugees? There are currently around 1,250 people being held in the two detention camps, mostly refugees from the Middle East and South Asia. The overwhelming majority are from Iran. Most were detained after arriving by boat, brought to Australia by people smugglers across a dangerous sea route hundreds of miles long. Between 2007 and 2013, when the current Operation Sovereign Borders campaign was launched, the Australian government said at least 1,200 people lost their lives trying to make the journey. According to official statistics , around 80% of people in offshore detention camps whose asylum claims have been assessed have been found to be legitimate refugees. How long have they been there? According to an Australian government report , the average length of time refugees spend in detention is 469 days, and steadily increasing. Conditions in the camps are very poor, which has resulted in immense international pressure on successive Australian governments to solve the issue, though domestic support remains high. In October Amnesty International accused Canberra of turning Nauru into an \" open-air prison ,\" and human rights abuses have been documented at the centers. Last year, a UN committee report found multiple cases of \"attempted suicide, self-immolation, acts of self-harm and depression\" among children who had lived in prolonged \"detention-like conditions.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:46:44.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
