Continent to face CIVIL WAR within 30 YEARS, Belgian historian claims A CIVIL WAR will erupt in Europe in as little as three decades, a Belgian historian has claimed. PUBLISHED: 22:13, Fri, Feb 3, 2017 | UPDATED: 23:19, Fri, Feb 3, 2017 \nDavid Engels, a historian at the Free University of Brussels, drew parallels between Europe and the fall of the Roman Republic to make the alarming prediction.He said: “In 20 to 30 years Europe will have become an authoritarian or imperial state, after a phase resembling civil war and decay.
