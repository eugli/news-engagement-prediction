He’s thinking about swirling it into sweet-and-salty Irish soda bread , to be spread with cream cheese and topped with smoked fish. This is one of many dishes he’s considering cooking when he comes to New York next week. \nHe’ll be here to give us a taste of The Sportsman , his self-dubbed “grotty rundown pub by the sea,” which is also known as the current best restaurant in the U.K. The two-night pop-up will happen at The Four Horsemen in Williamsburg . (You can book a table by emailing info@thefourhorsemen.com, or walk in Tuesday or Wednesday.) \nAt home in Kent, Harris sources ingredients from the marshes and beaches that surround his restaurant, so he’s curious to see what New York will provide in frosty February. “I’m afraid of your immigration if I turned up with dehydrated seaweed powder,” he says. “We intend to come in with nothing but a change of clothes.” \nHarris’s cooking is all about terroir. The Sportsman’s salt comes from the nearby Seasalter waters, the lamb graze nearby and the ham and herring are cured in-house. That’s just the way it’s done by the former history teacher turned self-taught chef. In the last 17 years, Harris and his brother Philip have transformed an old inn into the National Restaurant of the Year in 2016 , one poached oyster and mushroom and celeriac tart (with a hidden egg) at a time. \nOver that same timespan, he’s been toiling away on a cookbook—“We’re a slow burner,” he says—to be released by Phaidon this October.
