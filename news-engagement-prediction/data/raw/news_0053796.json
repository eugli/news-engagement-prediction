Six police officers were also hurt during the riots as they exchanged flash-bang explosives with protesters hurling rocks and firecrackers at them. \nD.C. police have stressed that the vast majority of protesters were peaceful, but that these 214 people -- the other 17 people arrested during the inauguration were released from custody -- showed up specifically to disrupt the event.\n\"Black bloc\" protest tactics, which have been used by some protesters for decades, include dressing in black or dark colored clothing while concealing one's face using scarves, masks and sunglasses. Some of the protesters brought with them hammers, crowbars, bricks, rocks, flares and firecrackers.\nA Florida man, Dane Powell, is accusing of felony rioting and assault on three police officers, but most of the protesters are charged with smashing windows at Starbucks and McDonalds while others torched a limo. Many of the violent protesters threw items at police, as well.\nIf convicted, felony rioting carries a maximum jail sentence up to 10 years, and a fine of up to $25,000.\n  'Not My President's Day': Thousands protest Trump on holiday Dozens fired after 'A Day Without Immigrants' protest Thousands rally for 'Today I am Muslim Too' protest in NYC", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:38:42.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
