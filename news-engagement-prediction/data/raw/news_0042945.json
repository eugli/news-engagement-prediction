The name \"Syonan\" was meant to evoke that dark and traumatic period in Singapore’s history. \nBut quite a few felt that the name itself, used like this, caused them pain. Many Singaporeans of all races suffered terrible atrocities during the Japanese Occupation, or had family members who did. \nMy colleagues and I honour and respect these deep feelings. So we have renamed the exhibition to bear witness to these painful memories. \nThank you all who shared your thoughts and views. Such conversations bring us closer together. \nI hope that Singaporeans will go and see the exhibition. We must never forget the events that so profoundly impacted our lives and shaped our society. – LHL\" Source:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:18:01.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
