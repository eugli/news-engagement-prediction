A.D. Carson in his studio. A doctoral student in rhetorics, communication, and information design at Clemson U., Mr. Carson successfully defended his unusual dissertation project on Friday. \n\"A nd If I’m scaring you brothers, if I’m scaring you. Just tell ’ em I came to do the talking. You just came to listen.\" \nThat’s an opening line in A.D. Carson’s Ph.D. dissertation at Clemson University. Mr. Carson, a doctoral student in rhetorics, communication, and information design, successfully defended his dissertation on Friday. \nIn lieu of the typical paper or project, Mr. Carson created a 34-track rap album, \"Owning My Masters: The Rhetorics of Rhymes & Revolutions,\" for the dissertation committee. His dissertation was more than just an album. His work included a timeline of social movements on campus, a blog, music videos, transcribed lyrics, and a peek into his compositional process. At his defense, he performed a four of his songs and showed one music video. \nHis master’s and undergraduate theses were also about music, but for his final project, Mr. Carson wanted to do something that pushed the boundaries. Drawing samples from several artists like Aretha Franklin and Buddy Rich, his album explores racism, problems in the rap community, and different facets of black lives. It also draws on his experience as a campus activist. “My committee was careful that the work actually does the work that it claims to do.” In April 2016, Mr. Carson was one of five students arrested on trespassing charges after they briefly occupied Sikes Hall, Clemson’s main administration building, during a nine-day sit-in on the steps of the building. The protests were organized by a student group called \"See the Stripes,\" which called attention to the racial climate on the campus and issued a statement of grievances and demands. \nThroughout the sit-in, Mr. Carson says he was working on his dissertation, and hoping that it would not only satisfy the committee but also spark a larger discussion about race, hip-hop culture, and activism. \nMr. Carson spoke with The Chronicle on Friday after defending his dissertation. The following transcript of that conversation has been edited for length and clarity. \nTell me about the different components of your dissertation. \nThere’s a 34-track album, a video channel, a photo gallery, and lyrics that are also transcribed on Rap Genius. There’s also a blog that has some video content. And then there’s a timeline that has multimedia links as well as bibliographical information. \nWhat was defending the dissertation like? \nThere’s no way that I could perform all 34 tracks, or present all of the videos for the interactive timeline, or any of the other components that exist as part of the project. It’s really a matter of trying to explain where I’m coming from by way of different examples and rooting what’s going on in some of the literature that I’ve been engaging with over the past couple years. \nHow what was it like when you presented this idea to your adviser? \nThe program is known for pushing the boundaries and really thinking about the ways that we engage with language and in language. He [Victor J. Vitanza, a professor of English and founding director of the program in rhetorics, communication, and information design] was pretty receptive. \nThe challenge was really for me to find a place for myself to do the kind of work that I would like to do. And then to be responsible about presenting that work in a manner that is going to be respectful to all of the multiple genres and disciplines that are being engaged. \nHow involved was your adviser? \nI’ve had many, many different advisers. My committee members all offered different perspectives in different ways to really make me think long and hard about the ways that my work is going to take in the digital form. \nHow did you get the idea to not just do an album, but a whole multimedia project? \nIt would be one thing to just do the album, but I think that it would be better representative of the kinds of engagement that might be happening in rap to have many of these different components. It’s not simply a matter of rap, but a kind of cultural production. \nWas there one particular moment when you thought, This isn’t just an album, but a cultural production? \nWith the See the Stripes campaign, you realize it’s not just music and poetry, but it’s also engaging in a community. These are things that led up to the nine-day sit-in that occurred last semester and my being one of the five people who were arrested.
