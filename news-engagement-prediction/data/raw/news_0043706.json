Those numbers subsequently improved to sixth and fifth respectively in the year after he joined from Adelaide. \nBut together with Selwood, the pair combined for 34.7 per cent of all clearances won by the side and 20.1 per cent of all contested possessions — too high an amount for just two players. \nAs a result, the difference between the side’s best and worst was pronounced. And the reason for that was the team’s lack of a second-tier through the midfield to aid its impressive double-act. \nAccording to Champion Data , Geelong ranked No.1 in the league against fellow top eight rivals throughout 2016, but the worst of all finals teams against bottom 10 opposition. \nDefeats to the likes of Carlton, Collingwood and St Kilda were low points on the season, but convincing victories over Hawthorn, the Western Bulldogs and Greater Western Sydney showed just how good the Cats could be when they were at their best. \nThe key to Chris Scott building the foundations for a successful premiership run now lies in closing the gap between the good and the bad.

With Dangerfield and Selwood a clear first and second, third place was claimed by the recently retired Corey Enright. \nMitch Duncan (eighth) was the only other out-and-out midfielder to secure a top 10 finish. \nWith that said, the onus now falls on a host of players to take up the slack. \nLive stream EVERY game of the JLT Community Series on FOX SPORTS.

SIGN UP NOW > \nFILLING THE VOID \nFORTUNATELY for the Cats, there are players waiting in the wings to take the next step. \nMitch Duncan, Cam Guthrie and Mark Blicavs are classified as the next tier of midfielders behind Dangerfield and Selwood — and all three have pathways to improve in 2017. \nAll eyes might be focused on Duncan, now 25, taking the big leap next season. \nHe averaged career-high numbers in disposals, tackles and inside 50s last year, but saw his goalkicking output dip. \nHaving kicked 87 goals across his first five years in the AFL system, Duncan showed he was a capable of impacting on the scoreboard from the middle. \nHowever, he hasn’t hit double figures in his last two seasons. \nStill rated at league average by Champion Data , he is looming as the clear candidate to aid ‘Dangerwood’ in 2017 and help bridge the side’s midfield class gap. \nGuthrie is coming off a career year, where he spent his time playing both through the midfield and across half back, averaging 22.9 disposals per game. Cam Guthrie had a career-best year in 2016. Picture: Wayne Ludbey.   \nIn the All-Australian conversation at the midway point of the year, his form plateaued across the second half of the season. However, expected to receive more midfield minutes in 2017, there’s no reason Guthrie can’t be the player to go to another level. \nRemarkably, at 198cm and 100kg, Blicavs evolved into a full-time midfielder in 2016. \nHe averaged 17.8 disposals and 5.8 tackles per game, with his elite fitness levels aiding his mobility around the ground. \nThe competition’s most prolific player from third-man up ruck opportunities, the abolition of such situations from the game will present the versatile Cat with more chances to effect the game on ground level — provided he does not transition into a permanent ruckman. \nHowever, given his ability to play anywhere on the field, don’t rule that out. \nPROVIDING THE DEPTH \nWHILE the next tier of elite midfielders might emerge for Geelong in 2017, depth remains crucial. \nYou only have to look at what the Western Bulldogs achieved last year, despite a host of injury issues, to see the value of building a deep on-ball group. \nScott Selwood, Sam Menegola and Josh Cowan arrived on the scene late in the year for differing fitness reasons, but will hopefully play a more key role in the side’s upcoming campaign. \nSelwood struggled with injury but is an experienced head who will get better with more minutes, Menegola had an immediate impact following his debut, while Cowan was clean on the outside. \nAll three should benefit from a full pre-season under their belts. \nAnd while Josh Caddy’s defection to Richmond — and the missed recruitment of Brett Deledio in return — might hurt initially, the Cats have a batch of young offensive-minded midfielders who will be looking to make their spot in the side their own. \nFormer top 10 draft pick Nakia Cockatoo is one who has shown glimpses of his talent, but has frustrated in equal measure across his short Geelong career. It’s been a similar story for Darcy Lang, who has found himself on the fringes of the best 22. \nSteven Motlop and Daniel Menzel can rotate through the midfield, but will play predominantly forward, while it’s too early to judge what Pick 26 Brandan Parfitt will add in his rookie year. \nAll are capable of making some sort of impact in 2017. Though more than just Dangerfield and Selwood will have to hit the ground running if Geelong is to prove itself the real deal.
