The pledge of support comes as The London branch of the Architectural Conservancy Ontario and the Heritage London Foundation released its 2017 Top Ten ‘Buildings on the Brink’ list.\nThe list brings attention to the state of significant heritage properties in the area that have been vacant for some time or are considered otherwise at increased risk. All of the buildings on this year’s list are heritage-listed or designated under the Ontario Heritage Act, but the ACO says their deteriorating condition means they are not safe from the ravages of neglect, the elements, or a lack of incentive and/or enforcement tools.\n2017 Top Ten ‘Buildings on the Brink’ \nWright Lithographing (c1902) 424 Wellington Street\nDesigned by London architects Hubert Carroll McBride & Frederick W. Farncomb; home to London Life (1906-1927) and Wright Lithographing; landmark red brick building with iconic four-sided public clock mount; vacant for over 10 years.\nLilley’s Corners (1871) 609 Dundas Street & Lilley Livery Stable (c1890) 620 Marshall Street\nFirst commercial structure erected in Old East; named for local businessman, postmaster, and London East’s first mayor Charles Lilley; \"Lilley's Corner: 1867\" date stone refers to when Lilley bought the land, not the date of construction; Hudson’s department store vintage neon sign.\nElsie Perrin Williams Memorial Library (1940) 305 Queens Avenue\nDesigned by London architects Thornton McBride and L. Gordon Bridgman; one of only three Queenston limestone Art Deco buildings in London (others are Dominion Public Building and Bell Canada building); built using funds from estate of Elsie Perrin Williams who also willed her home to the city; provided community educational and cultural facilities including an auditorium, museum, art gallery, and outdoor reading garden; vacant since 2002.\nLondon Psychiatric Hospital (1870) 850 Highbury Avenue North\nDesigned by London architect Thomas H. Tracy; provided care to 1700 patients by 1930s; heritage features include tree-lined avenue, Chapel of Hope (1884), Horse Stable (1894), Infirmary building (1902), and Recreation Hall (1920); vacant for many years.\nLondon and Western Trusts (c1920) 353 Richmond Street\nHome to London's first trust company established in 1896; Neo-Classical Revival facade, interior features original ornate plastered ceiling, wood panelling, and marble trim; vacant since 2003.\nFraser Hotel (c1892) 183 King Street\nBuilt as the St. James Hotel, became the Fraser House hotel & tavern, and then ironically the Young Women’s Christian Temperance Union; Second Empire style building features distinctive two-storey bow window; vacant since 2010.\nThe Cedars (c1880) 1266 Riverside Drive\nServed as a boating/athletic club before Herbert A. Sabine bought it in 1906; Sabine/Lamb family home until 1978; landmark Victorian home features an unusual double arcade verandah; vacant since 2013.\nGranger-McMahen Block / Gardner Galleries (1908) 186 York Street\nDesigned by London architect William George Murray; built as dry goods wholesale warehouse; one of only two remaining glazed terracotta buildings in London (other is McCormick’s factory in Old East); interior features original office partitions; vacant since 2014\nLoew's London Theatre (c1920) 194 Dundas Street\nDesigned by renowned American theatre and cinema architect Thomas Lamb who created over 300 theatres across North America including Toronto’s Elgin and Winter Garden Theatre (1914); Beaux-Arts building hosted vaudeville legends, concerts, and films; main theatre demolished 1990s but ornate hallway remains including terrazzo floors, gilded window mirrors, barrel-vaulted medallion ceiling, brass chandeliers, and marble baseboards.\nNan Finlayson's   home (1896) 100 Stanley Street\nWell-maintained Queen Anne style home with many original interior features; landscaping features award-winning native plant and butterfly garden; proposed for demolition to allow for widening of Wharncliffe Road for additional lanes of traffic.\nThe ACO says the city must find more creative ways of conserving and re-purposing the oldest buildings, and is urging the adoption of Private Member's  Bill C-323 to protect at-risk heritage assets. The bill titled An Act to Amend the Income Tax Act is currently before Parliament. The second reading happened on February 10 th . Only rarely does a private member’s bill become law.\nThis Bill would provide a 20 per cent tax credit on eligible costs for rehabilitation work done to designated historic places. It was inspired by the 40-year-old U.S. Federal Historic Tax Credit Program.\nThe ACO says adopting the bill would result in the numerous jobs for skilled workers, reduce demolition waste, and provide a means to promote heritage tied into the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of Canada’s confederation.\nThe ACO points to some previous ‘Buildings on the Brink’ properties that have since become award-winning success stories, such as the Normal School in Wortley Village, the Capital Theatre / Bowles Lunch, the Buchan House, and the Blackfriars Estate. Others, including Alma College, Locust Mount, and Middleton House at CPRI, have been demolished or destroyed by fire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:29:54.911+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
