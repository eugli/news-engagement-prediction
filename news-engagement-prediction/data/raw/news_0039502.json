While some have said the scandal was a “cover up without a crime,” others are speculating that the odd actions by Flynn are covering up misdeeds by himself or other members of the administration.\nVery soon after the Flynn resignation, the New York Times dropped another bombshell, saying that he wasn’t the only administration official to have interacted with Russian officials before the election. Meanwhile, other reports point to Obama officials and loyalists orchestrating a secret effort against Flynn for the sake of protecting the former president’s legacy in the Iran Nuclear Deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:16:28.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
