He served six months in prison but was then released on parole. \nPele is considered one of the greatest footballers of all time and won three World Cups with Brazil in 1958, 1962 and 1970. adekunle ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T15:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T10:22:55.194+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
