Now, a new report from South Korea is confirming that's going to be the case. \nRefurbished Galaxy Note7 units will hit the market as early as June this year, and will be available in emerging markets such as India and Vietnam. These units will have \"a new smaller battery and outer shell,\" report says, adding that \"other key parts are also likely to be replaced.\" \nThe tech giant announced the outcome of its Note7 investigation last month, blaming the phone's battery. In fact, the South Korean company said that original Galaxy Note7 units and replacement units had different battery defects. The Korean government also blamed batteries for the Note7 debacle. \nSamsung started selling refurbished Galaxy flagships in the US late last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:04:26.113+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
