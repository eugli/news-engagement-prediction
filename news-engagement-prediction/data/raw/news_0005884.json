Then they made a film out of it called \"Manhunter\", starring \"CSI:\"'s William Peterson. And in 1991 they brought Lecter back. Anthony Hopkins is the epitome of evil, with his soft spokeness and coolness, yet it is undeniable that he is one of the most evil characters in history. Jodi Foster also shines as a brave FBI agent trying to track down a ruthless killer. And how does she find him? By playing mind games with Dr. Lecter. I've noticed that many of the reviews have said \"Best Horror Movie Ever\", but is it really a \"horror movie\". I think not. I find this to be one of the most suspenseful Psychological Horror films of all time. So great are the performances that both Jodi Foster and Anthony Hopkins got Oscars (Hopkins' performance was 27 minutes long). This film will go down in history as one of the greatest in any genre. The Best Horror Movie of All Time by tchilds7 I almost never use the word \"best\" it's a must see that has won best picture, actor, actress, screenplay, and director you have to see this. BEST MOVIE EVER! by Nicholas Wilson Anthony Hopkins was only in this for like twenty four minutes and won an Oscar! The way he acts and the suspense he brings is amazing.
