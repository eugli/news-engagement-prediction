But experts pointed out that the court exercised the law as amended, and the punishment was actually at the lower end of the scale. \nThe Criminal Code says: “Where the offender has caused the death of more than one person or where in addition to causing the death of a person the offender has also caused bodily harm to another person or other persons the punishment shall be that of imprisonment of a term from five to 10 years.” \nMr Borg, a non-legal person, made it clear from the onset that he was raising the subject without any intention of influencing the appeal process but solely in a bid to address anomalies and disproportionality of sentences in certain cases. \nHe said there was a difference between an accused with a clean record and another who drove indiscriminately. Furthermore, he called for the competence of the Court, as regarded the suspended sentence, to be widened. There were criminals and victims but there were also victims of circumstances who had to be shown mercy. \nConcluding, Mr Borg called for a legal framework that would ensure real justice based on solidarity and dignity of the person. « No injuries in two armed hold-ups  //ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=12374496366&n=71b04b9b'  //ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=12374496366&n=71b04b9b'  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:18:10.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
