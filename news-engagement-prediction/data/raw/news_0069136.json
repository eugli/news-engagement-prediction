He was taken into custody but “battled all the way,” according to MacDonald. \nThe suspect, a 46-year-old from Surrey, received treatment in hospital and is expected to be charged with assault of a police officer, possession of stolen property and breaking and entering. \nPolice said the man has an extensive criminal record. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:03:02.588+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
