If so, then thanks for reading and now you can take another look at it. If you haven't, then that's why we are bringing this back for another lap before the 2017 OSAA wrestling championships hit the mat Friday at Veterans Memorial Coliseum. \nI put this together last year (with the help of readers, of course) to highlight some of the very best and brightest wrestlers this state has seen in the past 25 years. It was wildly popular a year ago, and so we thought you'd enjoy it again. \nI'm not going to add anybody to the list just for the sake of adding people, but with another year down I think it'd be safe to say that if I tacked on another year, David Douglas' Osa Odighizuwa and Hermiston's Sam Colbray would be there. There are a bunch of talented wrestlers currently competing, so their time to be remembered as one of the greats is coming as well. \nPictured here is Les Gutches, who won three state titles for South Medford from 1989-91, so he's right on the edge of the timeline we're looking at. The picture is of Gutches, right, after he defeated Kevin Jackson for a spot on the 1996 US Olympic team. Kenny Cox, Churchill \nCox was named the nation's top high school wrestler his senior year in 1997, and he won three Oregon titles for the Lancers from 1995-97. He also notched five junior national champions combined in both freestyle and Greco-Roman disciplines, and was named an ASICS All-American his junior and senior years. Cox died in August 2009 at the age of 31. Oscar Wood, Barlow \nWood was named the 1994 national high school wrestler of the year by ASICS, and the Bruin notched three state championships from 1992-94 and four junior Greco-Roman national titles. He compiled a prep record of 124-1, and that loss came in the 115-pound title match his freshman year to Thurston's John Culp. He wrestled collegiately at Oregon State, where he was an All-American twice, and represented the USA at the 2004 Summer Olympics. \n\nSgt.

He was the first Dayton wrestler in school history to claim four championships.
