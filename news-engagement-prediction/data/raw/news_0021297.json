Assigned to the appeal are Judge William Canby Jr., an appointee of President Jimmy Carter; Judge Richard Clifton, an appointee of President George W. Bush; and Michelle Friedland, an appointee of President Barack Obama.\nStory Continued Below\nTrump's executive order has been effectively on ice since Friday night, when U.S. District Court Judge James Robart granted a request from the states of Washington and Minnesota to temporarily ban officials from carrying out the president's directive. The votes of at least two of the three appeals court judges will be needed to lift some or all of Robart's order.\nThe states argued in their appeals court filing that Trump's claims that the travel limits are needed to combat terrorism are a \"sham\" aimed at obscuring a deliberate attempt to discriminate against Muslims, a purpose the states say is evident from Trump's own comments on the issue.\n\nLiberals exploiting anti-Obama tactics to thwart Trump’s travel ban By Josh Gerstein \nThe Justice Department has contended that Trump's authority to restrict foreigners' entry into the U.S. is essentially unfettered and not properly subject to scrutiny by the courts.\nTrump's order, issued Jan. 27, unleashed what the states and at least one federal judge have called \"chaos\" at the nation's international airports. The directive led to hundreds or thousands of travelers being delayed or detained for hours, including so-called green card holders who have lived in the U.S. for years. \nSome travelers were denied entry to the U.S., coerced into signing forms abandoning their U.S. visas, and placed on flights out of the country. The order also sought to shut down all refugee entry for 120 days, and indefinitely in the case of refugees from the ongoing civil war in Syria.\nView DOJ will argue Trump's travel ban An excerpt of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer's remarks on Tuesday.\n02/07/17 05:39 PM EST \nThe actions led to raucous protests and vigils at international airports across the U.S. After an outcry from travelers, their family members and members of Congress, the administration backed off enforcement of the ban against green card holders, initially offering case-by-case waivers, then a blanket waiver, then a memo from Trump's White House counsel saying such permanent U.S. residents were never covered by Trump's order.\nSince Robart's order blocking Trump's directive was issued Friday night, U.S. customs officials stopped enforcing the new rules and instructed airlines that passengers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen with previously issued visas could board U.S-bound flights.\nIn a court filing Monday, Justice Department lawyers insisted that Trump's entire order was legally justified. However, they also offered a fallback suggestion that Robart's order could be limited to visa holders who are already in the U.S. or who have made at least one prior trip to the U.S.\nLegal precedents suggest those individuals may be entitled to greater due process on immigration-related decisions than others who have no established ties to the U.S.\n\nTrump says he hopes 'common sense' travel ban doesn't go to the Supreme Court By Nolan D. McCaskill \nWhile Justice Department lawyers fight in court to restore Trump's order, the president continued to use Twitter and public appearances to wage an unprecedented public relations battle on behalf of his order and against judges standing in its way. One particular focus was U.S. District Court Judge James Robart, the Seattle-based George W. Bush appointee who issued the broadest halt on Trump’s directive.\n“The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy!” Trump wrote on Twitter Sunday. “Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!”\nOn Saturday, Trump appeared to question Robart’s legitimacy, calling him a “so-called judge” and dismissing his decision as “ridiculous” and \"terrible.\"\nTrump was somewhat more reserved on Tuesday, saying he was disappointed that there was a court battle over what he called a \"common sense\" proposal.\n\"We're going to take it through the system,\" he told reporters during a White House event with sheriffs. \"It's very important for the country.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:38:00.820+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
