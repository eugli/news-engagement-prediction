Because apparently she wasn’t quite well enough to come to the Commons yesterday Nick Robinson \nThe Labour MP replied: “She wasn’t very well, there wasn’t going to be a close vote – if there was a close vote they would bring in even sick people, but she wasn’t very well so she wasn’t in attendance.” \nThe radio presenter probed further and asked if the politician had spoken to Ms Abbott, to which he replied: “Not this morning no, to be honest with you.” \nRobinson then asked: “Is it Brexit flu? Some people are wondering.” \nHowever, Mr McDonnell reiterated: “No I don’t think so. I think she’s not very well, we’ve all been down with various bugs over the last few weeks.” Government Loses Brexit Vote Appeal Tue, January 24, 2017 Britain's most senior judges ruled that Prime Minister Theresa May does not have the power to trigger the formal process Article 50 for the UK's exit from the European Union without Parliament having a say. PA 1 of 12 Issued by the Supreme Court of (top row, from the left) Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr, Lord Sumption, (bottom row, from the left) Lady Hale, Lord Clarke, Lord Wilson and Lord Hodge, who agreed with the majority decision that the Government could not trigger Article 50 without Parliamentary approval. \nRefusing to let the topic slide, the host pushed further and asked: “So she’s not made to feel a bit sick by a position she’s uncomfortable with?” \nThe Hayes and Harlington MP said his whole party was \"uncomfortable\" but insisted the Labour Party was comprised of “democrats\". \n“Look, we’re all uncomfortable with the position,” he said. “We campaigned for Remain but we’re democrats, we have to accept the will of the people.” \nThe awkward exchange comes after 47 Labour MPs defied Jeremy Corbyn ’s three-line whip and voted against Article 50. \nDefending Mr Corbyn's decision to impose the whip on the radio station last week, Ms Abbot said it would be “wrong” to vote against triggering Article 50. \nMs Abbott added: “How could MPs vote in a referendum and turn around and say ‘it went the wrong way so we’re ignoring it’? There’s a real democratic principle here and the vote on Wednesday begins the process. \n“It’s not the beginning and the end but of course it’s a challenging situation for Labour.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T12:13:01.355+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
