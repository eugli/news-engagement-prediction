I'm covered in beer - I feel disgusting,\" Khan wrote. \"We weren't doing anything, we didn't actually even initially realise she was talking to us,\" she said.\n\"Once she threw in the line of Muslim b-words that's when we realised she was yelling at us,\" she said.\n\"At this point I decided to start filming her.\" The 27-year-old woman who carried out the attack is shown in the recording ordering Khan and her friends to get back.\nA police spokesman said they were \"aware\" of the video and a formal complaint had been laid. \"Police are assessing the information,\" the spokesman said\nIslamic Women's Council's spokeswoman Anjum Rahman said she was appalled, but not entirely surprised, by the abuse.\n\"A small number of New Zealanders behaved in that way.

I'm still with the police - will try and respond once I'm done,\" Khan tweeted.\n\"My phone is over run with positive messages right now.
