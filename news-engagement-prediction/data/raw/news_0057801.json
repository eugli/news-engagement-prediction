Especially when the IPO was blank, CPIO could not have filled it up as it would amount to tampering with the record,” the court said while staying the three orders of CIC. \nIt also issued notice to the RTI applicants in all three matters and listed them for hearing on April 27. \nAccording to DU’s pleas, in the matter pertaining to Irani, applicant R K Jain had left the PO blank, leaving it to the CPIO to fill it up in whose favour it had to be made. \nIn the other two matters, the POs were made out in favour of the CPIO, who had returned the applications within a few days asking the applicants -- Mohd Irsad and Sanjay Singh -- to make the POs favouring DU Registrar, the varsity said in its pleas. \nThe court noted that in these two matters, the CPIO had “acted with promptitude” by pointing out the problem in the applications and it was the applicants who had “acted in haste” by moving CIC. \nCIC had imposed Rs 25,000 penalty against the CPIO in each of the three cases for denial of information to the applicants. \nThe court stayed the orders of December 22, 23 and 27 last year. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:11:58.764+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
