Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nAlli has become a genuine goalscoring threat for the north London outfit and King believes it is this quality that draws comparisons with Lampard. \nEx-midfielder Lampard, who announced his retirement earlier this month, became Chelsea’s all-time leading goalscorer after spending 13 years at Stamford Bridge. \n‘He has to play sometimes on the left or in the middle but whenever he has performed, he is a bright spark in the team and always looks like a goal threat which is a huge bonus for a midfield player,’ King told the Evening Standard . Chelsea great Frank Lampard (Picture: Getty) Former Tottenham and England defender Ledley King (Picture: Getty) \n‘He is a bit similar to Frank Lampard in that respect, someone you can count on to get a significant amount of goals from midfield in any given season. Players like that are gold dust.’ \nDespite Alli’s impressive form for Tottenham, the 20-year-old has not scored in his last five appearances for the club.
