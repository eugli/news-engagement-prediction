A photo posted by Beyoncé (@beyonce) on Feb 1, 2017 at 10:39am PST \nPosing nearly naked atop a bed of flowers, Queen Bey wore an Agent Provocateur bra (which were quickly identified by lingerie blogger Cora Harrington ), a pair of baby blue silk bloomers and one large piece of green mesh netting. \nNot everyone was taken with the look. The Huffington Post’s own Noah Michelson wasted no time bringing the hard-hitting questions to the forefront on Facebook: \n“I’m having a hard time thinking about anything other than whose idea was it to shoot her in front of a funeral wreath in that awful bra and that pea soup green mosquito net? Is this some kind of coded illuminati message? Can we start a petition to get her art director fired? Help?” \nOthers commended her for doing whatever she damn wants to do at any given moment in time. Beyoncé is so beautifully ratchet. This joint looks like a nativity scene shot at Sears. Definitely the Super Deluxe package. I love her. pic.twitter.com/r0Uc32bqQw — Jermaine Spradley (@MrSpradley) February 1, 2017 \nBut if you, like Ellen Degeneres , wish to recreate this colorful, polarizing outfit, you’re in luck.
