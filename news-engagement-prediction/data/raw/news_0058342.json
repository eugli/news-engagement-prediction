Editor Advertisement \nSad to hear of the news of the body of the man believed to be that of the missing hiker Steward Lee found in a mult-storey carpark. He was finally found in the same neighbourhood as the one he was last seen in. \nSteward Lee had been missing since Friday, and his friends and family members had spared no effort to try and find him. How he had managed to remain missing for three days, no one will probably know. Police investigations are ongoing in this very minute, let's hope they ascertain the cause of death really soon. This will hopefully bring closure to the family of the deceased. \nWe may never know what made him leave on Friday and never came back. Speculation mounting online as to what caused his death, but do spare a thought for the family, and let them grieve privately. \nNeo SW \nA.S.S.
