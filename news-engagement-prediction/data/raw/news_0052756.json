DEREK FLYNN/FAIRFAX NZ \nCraig Harper looks focused as he crosses the Wairau River bridge on State Highway 1 outside Blenheim on Wednesday. \nIn order to achieve his goal he had slept for only short periods of one to two hours along the way. \nSpeaking an hour before the finish support crew member Mark Hawkins said Harper would have to be assessed and begin his recovery once he got off the bike and would not be immediately available to comment. DEREK FLYNN/FAIRFAX NZ \nCraig Harper was able to stop for a few minutes to greet supporters in Blenheim on Wednesday. \nThe ride had gone without hitch, with no rain and only a serious headwind on the first day. \"We haven't even had any mechanicals, not so much as a puncture over some 2000km,\" Hawkins said. \nHarper had found the last part of the ride tough as he faced some serious hills around Dunedin and an undulating road towards Invercargill, Hawkins said. \n\"He has had his highs and lows. It has been absolutely incredible to witness what he has been through.\" SUPPLIED \nCraig Harper some 200 kilometres into his journey after leaving Cape Reinga at 8am on Monday morning. \nA major part of the record attempt was to raise funds for the Kiwi Can programme in Marlborough. The programme, which taught positive values to primary school children, was run by the Graeme Dingle Foundation Marlborough. Ad Feedback \nRegional manager Kelvin Watt said they were in awe of the progress Harper had made. \"It's just incredible. He has been so strong the whole way - he is a machine.\" \nHarper made his way through Blenheim around 3.30pm on Wednesday where he was met by a large crowd of supporters, including his young daughters. \nHowever, he was only able to stop for just a few minutes before continuing on in order to make the cutoff time to use the Rainbow Road to Hanmer Springs. \nHe enjoyed a tailwind along the Canterbury Plains and reached Dunedin early on Friday morning before making the final push to the finish. \nHarper is a respected endurance cyclist having won races such as the 640km Maxi Enduro at the Lake Taupo Cycle Challenge in 2015 and the 1010km 10-lap Mammoth race at the Forrest GrapeRide in 2014. \nThe previous record for cycling the length of the country was set by fellow Kiwi endurance cyclist Colin Anderson in 2007. - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:44:03.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
