The 76-year-old vocalist, whose opening for the Bruce Willis-Cybill Shepherd series Moonlighting was among the 1980s’ most popular and best remembered TV theme songs, was hospitalized in Los Angeles two weeks ago for exhaustion. His death was confirmed via his official Twitter page. “He was in the hospital,” the announcement stated, “kept comfortable by his wife, son, and a few of his family and friends.” Jarreau’s 1981 album “Breakin’ Away,” with its title song and its now-standard single “We’re In This Love Together,” established the singer as a leader of the smooth, jazzy pop then just gaining momentum. Like his friend George Benson, he quickly crossed over into the culture’s musical mainstream, participating in 1985’s celebrity-singalong “We Are The World” and, the same year, lending a breezy sophistication to the comic sleuthing of Moonlighting (“Some walk by night/some fly by day…”). Listen to it below. With nearly two dozen albums to his name, Jarreau won seven of the awards that will, no doubt, pay him tribute tonight. Already, Hollywood has begun its respects. #AlJarreau had a mellifluous voice. Soothing. beautiful. Gone forever may you rest in peace! \n— octavia spencer (@octaviaspencer) February 12, 2017 LEGENDARY Al Jarreau has passed. I was inspired by his music & his voice-so different & so unique.
