(Photo: Mark Dolejs, USA TODAY Sports) 1 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nDURHAM, N.C. — Nearly a month and a half have passed since the infamous tripping incident, the tearful apology and the controversial one-game suspension. \nAnd Duke’s Grayson Allen is finally willing to admit that he’s had a tough season. He won’t go into details — “I mean, right now is not going to be a tell-all,” Allen said Thursday night following a 25-point performance in an exhilarating 86-78 win over rival North Carolina — but he’ll briefly summarize. \nHas he had fun all season? “No,” Allen said, before quickly smiling. “But I’ve definitely felt good lately, and I am having fun now. … It’s never been around the shots falling. I’m playing for this team and nothing else. It’s really as simple as that.” No. 19 Duke hits its stride, shoots past archrival No. 7 North Carolina \nBut it’s worth noting: The shots have started falling, too, as Allen has loosened up. During Duke’s current winning streak which now stretches to four games, Allen is averaging 21.5 points per game. He’s 20-for-41 from beyond the arc and a perfect 14-of-14 from line. His actions have matched his words. \n“I just feel better, getting back into the swing of things,” Allen said. “I’m just playing with a lot of confidence. When Coach tells you to shoot the ball, you shoot the ball.” \nConfident Grayson Allen is exactly the Grayson Allen the Blue Devils need moving forward, as they — finally — try to fit some extremely talented pieces together in the right way to make a deep March run. Sure, Duke has veteran leadership in its captains, Matt Jones and Amile Jefferson. It has arguably the nation’s most improved player in Luke Kennard, and freshmen like Jayson Tatum starting to hit their stride. Even Harry Giles added solid contributions on both ends off the bench Thursday. \nGrayson Allen celebrates with Duke fans after a huge win. (Photo: Streeter Lecka, Getty Images) \nBut in order to take this team from good on paper to great in action, Allen is the key. \nHe knows how to carry the scoring load, which he did a season ago on his way to earning ACC first-team honors. He knows how to step up in limited minutes, which helped Duke win a national title two years ago. \nHe didn’t know, necessarily, how to properly manage the moments his passion and competitiveness became unwieldy — the two apparently intentional tripping incidents last season, and the one against an Elon player earlier this year that ultimately led to the suspension. \nThat suspension and the immediate aftermath were not easy for Allen, who has not embraced nor necessarily thrived in the role of the hated Duke villain. He said Thursday that there were times this season that were “tough,” and it doesn’t take a ton of guesswork to figure out which times those were. \nDuke Blue Devils head coach Mike Krzyzewski celebrates with guard Grayson Allen (3) and forward Harry Giles (1) in the closing seconds of the second half of their game against the North Carolina Tar Heels at Cameron Indoor Stadium. (Photo: Mark Dolejs, USA TODAY Sports) \nThey were the times and days he lacked confidence, games he lacked aggressiveness. He said Thursday that he drove to the basket more and thought shot-first instead of passing, particularly after he noticed early in the game that North Carolina defenders weren’t helping off Kennard. But that quick observation — and adjustment — are parts of the game that don’t come quickly when nothing’s coming easy. \nThat’s not to say Allen is home free, poised for an incredible stretch run, or all of Duke’s problems are solved. Four weeks remain in the regular season, and considering how difficult the ACC is on a nightly basis, no wins will be guaranteed. \nBut a star player’s confidence can be contagious —and it’s time to see what Allen’s can do for Duke. \nCOLLEGE BASKETBALL HIGHLIGHTS Posted!
