Weintraub said Wednesday. “ \nThe grand jury report paints a picture of an elite boarding school -- tuition now costs $35,000 a year for day students and $52,000 for residents -- where rules were loose and relationships were informal: Many teachers live on campus. It was routine for them to take students out on errands or trips. In one alleged incident, a nude model failed to show up for one of the school’s art classes -- so the teacher stepped in and modeled nude for the class, the report said. \n\"No boundaries existed between students and teachers,\" it said, creating \nThe 49-page report noted the school, which now has 220 students, 79 of whom live on its New Hope campus, had recognized the problems under current headmaster Tom Wilschutz and had taken steps to address them.

He could not be reached for comment Wednesday; his only listed phone number was disconnected. \nThe victim who reported the 1968 anal rape, now 62, testified that he’s now afraid to leave his house, is fearful of the dark, and takes medication for severe anxiety disorder. \nA 42-year-old Massachusetts woman who described Solebury as a “free-for-all” said she had a long-term sexual relationship with her 10th-grade English teacher, John Ward Regan, in the 1990s. She claimed the relationship derailed her education and contributed to an eating disorder. Regan, now a college professor in New York, repeatedly invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent during his interview with the grand jury, the report said. \nA Stony Brook, N.Y. phone listing for Regan was disconnected Wednesday. \nAnother victim, a 51-year-old California lawyer, told the grand jury she was kissed by a school trustee and major donor as a Solebury student in the early 1980s. She was allegedly told by the then-headmaster: \"Let it go.\" \nThe oldest victim, now 77, recounted for the grand jury her relationship with Robert Shaw, a now-deceased language teacher whom the students called \"Pop Shaw.\" When she was 15, Shaw began tutoring her, he said, then taking her on short road trips. \nDuring her junior and senior years of high school — from 1952 to 1954 — he allegedly rented a home nearby to have sex with her. \nIt continued until the woman broke it off when she was 22. Over the following decades, the woman contacted various school officials, who told her to forget the incident. She was in therapy for most of her life, she told the grand jury. In 2014, she talked to Wilschutz, who removed Shaw’s name and portrait from the campus. \nShe told the grand jurors: \n“I want people to understand — yes, I’m 77, but I want you to understand this has been with me my whole life.” \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:29:49.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
