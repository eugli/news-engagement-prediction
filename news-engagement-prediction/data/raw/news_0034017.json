He is facing a hearing charged with two counts of common assault. \nThe second charge relates to an allegation he pushed Ms Ting against a wall and knocked her unconscious. media_camera Parramatta Eels player Semi Radradra faces an uncertain future in the NRL. Picture: Troy Snook \nA third allegation that he kicked her in the stomach when he was pregnant has been dropped. \nAn arrest warrant had to be issued for the 24-year-old at the time of his last court appearance in November, after he failed to show Parramatta Local Court while still in Fiji, before fronting to training two days later. \nHis passport was seized on that occasion, however he was given permission to travel to and play in the Auckland Nines last weekend. \nRadradra has already signed a one-year deal to shift to French rugby union at the end of the year with Top 14 club Toulon, with an option for a second season in 2018-19. \nThe NRL and Parramatta will wait on the outcome of the court matter before determining any potential penalty being handed down to the one-time Australian representative. \nThe hearing continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:06:40.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
