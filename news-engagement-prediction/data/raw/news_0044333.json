At $651, the average price of an iPhone is already well above the $208 average cost of an Android smartphone. If Apple adds technology that costs a lot more money to produce, are you ready to foot the bill? | Topic: iPhone Image: David Gewirtz' dark and disturbing nightmares \nAt $651, the average price of an iPhone is well above the worldwide $208 average cost of an Android smartphone. \nLast year, my wife and I bought two top-of-the-line 128GB iPhone 6s Plus models, along with AppleCare. We knew what we were getting ourselves into. Still, after the four hour danse macabre that was buying a phone at the Apple Store , the two thousand dollar price tag for the two phones felt like a kick in the gut. Read More \nWe're paying for them over time, with interest free financing, so it wasn't an immediate hit on the wallet. And yes, after 18 months we still find them very valuable. Even so, the premium Apple charge sometimes seems questionable. \nJason Perlow recently explored whether Apple's prices are worth it . He has a 256GB iPhone 7 for which he, too, paid more than a thousand dollars. But he's also been using a much less expensive ZTE Axon 7 Android phone. The Axon is -- you're going to need to sit down for this -- $600 less expensive than the iPhone. \nHere's the kicker: Jason reports that the app-using experience is virtually identical. Gmail, Facebook, Outlook, and Twitter all feel the same between the two phones. Here's what he says is the bottom line observation: When you start talking about a $400 to $600 difference in price, the mystique and perceived advantages of a brand and OS platform start to look a bit silly (especially when the mainstream apps are the same, behave effectively the same, and provide the same features). \nThat's a lot of money. Because Jason and I need to stay up-to-date on Apple gear as part of our jobs, we'll probably both pay the premium anyway. But will everyone? And what happens if the price of an iPhone doubles? \nI can't imagine Apple would be that foolish, but then again I have two words: \"Touch Bar.\" So, anything is possible. According to an article in AppleInsider , the entry level cost of the iPhone 8 may nearly double, to $1000. \nThe reason cited is that Apple may go to OLED display technology, instead of the LCD technology used on current iPhone 7s. Apple may also expand the screen to include the area of the home button, and implement Touch ID via the OLED display, very much like it does on the new MacBook Pro machines. \nYou'll recall that the base iPhone 7 is $649. If Apple makes the base price over a thousand dollars, then those devices with 128-256GB are likely to cost considerably more. Add in AppleCare, and you're looking at spending $1500 for a phone. Or you could get a solid Android phone for $400. read this", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:20:29.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
