In total, more than 650 pilot whales have beached themselves along a 5 kilometer (3 mile) stretch of coastline over two days on Farewell Spit at the tip of the South Island. About 335 of the whales are dead, 220 remain stranded, and 100 are back at sea.\nDepartment of Conservation Golden Bay Operations Manager Andrew Lamason said they are sure theyâ€™re dealing with a new pod because they had tagged all the refloated whales from the first group and none of the new group had tags.\nThe news was devastating for hundreds of volunteers who had come from around the country to help with the initial group of 416 stranded whales that was found early Friday, many of them already dead.
