The party for 50 people at Hotel Bel-Air was said to be thrown by Tori Spelling’s mother, Candy Spelling. But Eustace, who was married to Dean McDermott from 1993-2006, says that it is hard to believe when Spelling and McDermott cry poverty, that they have such an expensive party for a fifth baby who has not yet been born. \nEustace said that McDermott will have to face her on March 9th in Los Angeles Superior Court at 8:30a.m. Tori Spelling’s $40,000 Baby Shower Pissed Off Dean McDermott’s Ex-Wife – https://t.co/JUAuVAjypF pic.twitter.com/IaCkTPyOwh \n— Fleekist (@FleekistOnline) February 20, 2017 \nIt is well-known that Tori Spelling is the daughter of famed producer Aaron Spelling who was responsible for such shows as Love Boat, Fantasy Island, and Beverly Hills, 90210 , and that his widow, Candy, is worth something like $600 million , but it seems that Tori Spelling was stiffed in Aaron Spelling’s will, says FoxNews . \nTori Spelling and Dean McDermott have reportedly been sued by American Express for $87k, and have also been hit with a tax lien of $259,108 from unpaid taxes of 2014. Spelling has written a few books, including Spelling It Like It Is , where she shared with her fans that she and McDermott have had various financial struggles in an attempt to be relatable. \n“It was one chapter. I thought I was being relatable, talking about how celebrities go through financial struggles, too, we make mistakes, too.” \nSpelling included all of the “behind the scenes” of her reality show with Dean McDermott, and how they handle life with four children. But Mary Jo Eustace sees all of it as a poke in the eye, as no money seems to go towards Jack, who just turned 18.
