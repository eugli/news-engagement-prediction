Ukoette said. \nHe further lamented, “I am also seeing a situation whereby I will team up with other progressives to salvage Akwa Ibom from the grip of a certain few hawks, who have formed an oligarchy in order to enslave and perpetually keep Akwa Ibom in a state of ruin.” More on Politics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:39:43.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
