(Reuters) \nBMC election results 2017: With the Shiv Sena well on way to beating the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) in its Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) stronghold today with the counting of votes putting the party well ahead, it has made one thing clear – Uddhav Thackeray ’s anti- Narendra Modi campaign has paid off handsomely. Before, during and even after the civic election campaign, Thackeray had not shied away from bringing down the BJP and Narendra Modi achievements and promises in Maharashtra and across India. In fact, Shiv Sena had virtually stolen the opposition parties’ ( Congress , and NCP) thunder by saying all the things that they were expected to do. Considering that Shiv Sena and BJP are allies at the Centre in the NDA government led by PM Modi, this had caused consternation initially. But eye-brows were really lifted when the BJP refused to rise to the bait to hit back at their recalcitrant ally. From Narendra Modi to party chief Amit Shah and even Home Minister Rajnath Singh , no one rose up to protest. Even Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis played down the acts of defiance by Shiv Sena. Same applied to Nitin Gadkari who is a powerful Maharashtra leader. At the lower level, Shiv Sena men were seen virtually taking over the streets, strutting about while the BJP men and other parties supporters sticking to the shadows. All of the BJP leaders were unanimous in their reactions, saying all was well with the alliance and that not much attention should be given to the campaign vitriol being spread by the Sena. \nYou may also like to watch: \nThe ultimate result of this open defiance of BJP and of Narendra Modi is clear – defeat in the richest civic body in Asia. This has surely dented the image of Narendra Modi as a strong man who tolerates no defiance and is willing to go it alone unless he gets his way. Playing second-fiddle is not something that the public has seen him do ever and this new avatar of the leader comes as a big surprise. This may also hurt BJP prospects in the future. The Assembly elections will eventually roll around and with Shiv Sena grabbing the higher ground it is likely to run away with the result in future – however, that is still in the realm of conjecture and reality is that Shiv Sena is not strong across Maharashtra. In fact, Sena is not strong even in big cities like Nashik and Nagpur. However, in public perception, if one party acquires dominance in mind space, the chances of it emerging triumphant increase phenomenally. Will that happen? Perhaps. But what is certainly happening is that Modi charisma has been dented in the face of the targetted attack by Sena that it did not repulse in kind. Also, it shows that this kind of personalised strategy can create a win-win situation. Please Wait while comments are loading...
