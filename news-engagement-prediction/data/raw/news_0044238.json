The teacher had a valid visa. (Evan Vucci/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  22 PM \nA British Muslim teacher traveling with his students from Iceland to New York was denied entry to the United States despite having a valid visa, according to a report. \nJuhel Miah, of Neath Port Talbot, Wales, and his students from Llangatwg Community School boarded a flight from Reykjavik, Iceland to New York on Feb. 16, but he was suddenly escorted off the plane by security without an explanation, Britain’s Wales Online reported . \n“It made me feel like a criminal,” Miah, who local authorities say has a valid travel visa, told the website . “I couldn’t speak, I was lost for words.” \nMiah’s removal left his students “shocked and distressed,” but the school trip continued as planned. — South Wales EP (@SWEveningPost) February 20, 2017 \nThe 25-year-old who’s described as a “popular and respected teacher” at the school was also denied access to the U.S. Embassy in Iceland. \nNeath Port Talbot County Borough Council has written to the U.S. Embassy in London condemning its treatment of Miah. \n\"Mr. Miah attempted to visit the Embassy; but was denied access to the building,” a council spokesman said. “Understandably he feels belittled and upset at what appears to be an unjustified act of discrimination.” Juhel Miah, 25, teaches at Llangatwg Community School in Aberdulais, Wales.
