Sources told KDVR that the disciplinary action took months because of her high rank.\nScroll down for video\nKerry O'Grady, a special agent in charge of the Secret Service in Denver, said she wouldn't take a bullet for Trump - she's been suspended with pay\nO'Grady said that civil rights were moving back to the Dark Ages. She never names Trump but it's clear who she's talking about\nO'Grady oversees presidential candidates' and presidential visits to the Denver region. It's not clear how long her suspension will last or if that is as far as her disciplinary action will go.\nIn October, she posted that she would rather go to jail than 'take a bullet' for Trump - although she avoided referring to him by name, prompting public outrage.\nOfficials have now confirmed that she's been suspended with pay, according to CBS4.\nThe post in question said: 'As a public servant for nearly 23 years, I struggle not to violate the Hatch Act,' which refers to the act that bars executive branch staff from engaging in certain political activities.\n'So I keep quiet and skirt the median. To do otherwise can be a criminal offense for those in my position. Despite the fact that I am expected to take a bullet for both sides.'\nShe continued: 'But this world has changed and I have changed. And I would take jail time over a bullet or an endorsement for what I believe to be disaster to this country and the strong and amazing women and minorities who reside here. Hatch Act be damned. I am with Her.'\nO'Grady said this week that she is devoted to her mission to serve her country and that nothing would stop her from doing her job.\n'I hope you understand that's an emphatic no,' she said when asked if he political stance would affect her job, 'and I need to make sure that's resoundingly clear and just reinforces that this job needs to done well.'\n'As a public servant for nearly 23 years, I struggle not to violate the Hatch Act,' she wrote, referring to the act that bars executive branch staff from engaging in certain political activities\nSecret Service employees are covered by the act which bars employees in the executive branch from posting partisan messages on social media, or sharing and disturbing partisan material, according to the Washington Examiner.\nIn operational security training, agents are warned against the use of social media because it can expose their personal information and their movements, sources say.\nThat post triggered at least one complaint to the Secret Service, those sources added.\nO'Grady told the Examiner she took down the post just a couple of days after it was posted.\nShe explained that she wrote the post shortly after learning that Trump was being accused of sexually abusing a number of women. It was just days after the notorious video of Trump telling Access Hollywood' host Billy Bush he could grab women 'by the p***y.'\nAs a survivor of alleged sexual abuse, O'Grady said she had written the message while overcome with emotion by the news.\nO'Grady has also made numerous other posts criticizing Donald Trump during his campaign - and even after his election\nBut she took down the post after realizing 'it was not the sentiment that I needed to share because I care very deeply about the mission.'\n'My government is the most important thing to me,' she said. 'I serve at the pleasure of the president, but I still have the First Amendment right to say things.'\nHowever, that was not the only anti-Trump post O'Grady made.\nOver the past few months, she continued to make political comments online criticizing Trump and his adversaries.\nO'Grady previously shared a Huffington Post story with the headline: 'Scott Baio Defends Trump's Sexism with More Sexism', with her comment; 'One word: douche. How do you like them apples?!'\nA month after her 'bullet' post, she shared a Vox post, headlined 'Donald Trump nominates Jeff Sessions to serve as attorney general' on which Vox commented 'Just a few years ago, this would have been unimaginable.'\nO'Grady, who removed the post a couple of days later, said she wrote it after being overcome with emotion following Trump's 'grab them by the p***y' video\nQuote: : 'We are moving our civil rights into a period of bigotry, misogyny and racism that this country has not tolerated for decades. Dark ages. I am horrified and dismayed beyond words.'\nDuring the Women's March, she posted the logo for the movement as her Facebook cover. She Quote: : 'All of these women represent me! Proud to say it! #nasty,' referring to the phrase Clinton supporters referred to themselves by after Trump labelled Hillary a 'nasty woman.'\nOn Inauguration Day, she updated her profile picture to a picture of Princess Leia with the words, 'A woman's place is in the resistance' - a reference to the rebel alliance in Star Wars, or those opposing Trump's presidency.\nAll political posts have since been removed.", "external_links": ["http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/senior-secret-service-agent-suggests-she-wouldnt-take-a-bullet-for-trump/article/2612814", "http://kdvr.com/2017/02/02/top-denver-secret-service-agent-suspended-over-social-media-posts/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-03T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:47:43.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
