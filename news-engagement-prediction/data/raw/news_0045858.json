Celebrity rogues gallery Monday, 23rd May 2016 Here is a list of famous personalities and disgraced entertainers who have been convicted of sex crimes. 1 / 11 \nKeen sailor Sir Ted – who died in 2005 – offered young boys trips on his yacht, according to a dossier compiled by Labour peer Baroness Castle. \nOne man claimed the Europhile picked him up when he was hitchhiking in Kent as a 12-year-old in the 1960s and lured him to his Mayfair flat. \nBut it later emerged the man was not 12 at that time and Sir Ted never had a flat in Mayfair. \nPA PALS: Sir Ted associated with celeb paedophile Jimmy Savile \nUnverified claims from an alleged victim – which one expert has dismissed as “fantastical”– focus on Sir Ted abusing children in a Satanic ritual. \nAt total of seven police forces – Hampshire, Jersey, Kent, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Thames Valley and the Metropolitan Police – have investigated allegations against the former leader. \nA former brothel owner – who was rumoured to have knowledge of Sir Ted using child prostitutes – has said he was gay and lonely, but not a paedophile . \nSupporters have defended Sir Ted’s memory, claiming he couldn’t have abused children because he didn’t drive and always had a police escort. \nBut photos of the “asexual” politician driving along in 1975 have emerged. \nA source told the Mail: “Mr Veale believes in them 120 per cent and thinks they are totally convincing. \n“There are very close similarities in the accounts given by those who have come forward. The same names used for him, the same places and same type of incidents keep coming up. \n“What stands out is that the people giving these accounts are not connected but the stories and the details dovetail. \n“It contains disturbing stuff. \n“Investigators have been shocked by what they have learned.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T10:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:53:49.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
