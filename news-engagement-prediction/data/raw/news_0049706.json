By HAEYOUN PARK and TROY GRIGGS UPDATED FEB. 21, 2017 Scroll to start The tiny figures here represent the estimated 11 million immigrants who are in the United States illegally. Early in the campaign, Donald J. Trump said he would deport all of them. (Each figure represents about 5,000 people.) After the election, Mr. Trump vowed to quickly deport two million to three million unauthorized immigrants who he said have been convicted of crimes. The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday announced details to expel immigrants more aggressively. Mr. Trump may be basing this number on a 2012 government estimate that there were 1.9 million “removable criminal aliens.” But that number included more than a million immigrants who were here legally, with green cards or temporary visas. Unauthorized immigrants Legal immigrants There are about 820,000 unauthorized immigrants who have been convicted of crimes , according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research group. If Mr. Trump targeted only those with serious offenses, the number becomes even smaller. About 690,000 of the 820,000 were convicted of felonies or serious misdemeanors. It’s unclear if Mr. Trump could carry out the deportations he has proposed without violating due process, especially at the scale and speed he has suggested. The last time the United States carried out mass deportations was when President Dwight D. Eisenhower authorized military-style roundups to expel hundreds of thousands of Mexicans in 1954. What Mr. Trump proposes is much larger than Eisenhower’s deportation program, which was controversial at the time. Mr. Trump would likely need help from local law enforcement, but many cities and counties have limited their cooperation with federal authorities. Counties with policies limiting cooperation WASH.
