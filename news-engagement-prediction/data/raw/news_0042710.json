Andrei Markov scored for Montreal (31-20-8), while Carey Price made 31 saves.\nPerreault broke a 1-1 deadlock just 1:16 into the final frame. He sent a backhand shot over Price's shoulder after a nifty one-handed pass from Dustin Byfuglien.\nLaine added the insurance goal at 18:43 for his 50th point of the season. The Canadiens have only one victory in their last eight games.\nMontreal was sloppy in its first game back following its bye week and it cost the home side on Winnipeg's first goal.\nWith the Canadiens on the power play in the second period, defenceman Nathan Beaulieu skated out of his own zone, then tried to dangle the puck around Armia in the neutral zone.\nThe Jets winger easily stole the puck, skated in on Price and scored Winnipeg's sixth short-handed goal of the season to tie the game at 4:52. Montreal had 18 giveaways in the game.\nIn one of his first coaching decisions since replacing Michel Therrien on Tuesday, Julien put Alex Galchenyuk on the first line with Alexander Radulov and captain Max Pacioretty.\nThat move paid instant dividends on Montreal's first goal on a rarely seen pinch by defenceman Markov.\nThe Russian's forecheck on Blake Wheeler forced a giveaway in Winnipeg's zone, with the puck falling right to Galchenyuk. The centreman then found Pacioretty, who gave it back to Markov in the crease for the easy tap-in at 11:04 of the first period.\nPacioretty has seven points in his last four games.\nPrice did his best to keep rookie Laine off the scoresheet, stopping all six shots he faced from the 18-year-old. But with Price on the bench and Montreal's net empty, Laine scored his fifth goal in his last three games.\nMichael McCarron, recalled from the St. John's IceCaps on Friday, centred the fourth line for Montreal. Davis Desharnais and Sven Andrighetto were healthy scratches.\n\nÂ© The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:23:15.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
