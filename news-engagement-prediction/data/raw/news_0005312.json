It might be Vijay’s 61st project but it’s the production house – Sri Thendal Films’ 100th project. C Sundar’s Sanghamitra was to be their 100th film, but as its pre-production got delayed, they went ahead with Vijay’s film. The makers are planning to shoot across UK, US and north India. They have also roped in AR Rahman to compose the music. We are super excited after all Vijay is teaming up Atlee once again. They delivered the blockbuster film – Their last year. We can’t wait to find out what adventure they will take us on this time. \nVijay’s last film was Bairavaa directed by Bharathan. While the film received mediocre reviews the movie managed to fared decently at the Tamil Nadu box office. However its collections were badly affected around the time of protests against the ban on Jallikattu. It was only because Suriya’s Singam 3 release got delayed, Vijay’s Bairavaa collection got a major boost in the 3rd week of its release. as of now, the movie has managed to rake in Rs 62 crore. While the other films that released during Pongal – Chiranjeevi’s Khaidi No. 150 and Nandamuri Balakrishna’s Gautamiputra Balakrishna fared phenomenally at the box office. In fact the former crossed the Rs 100 crore mark. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:33:50.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
