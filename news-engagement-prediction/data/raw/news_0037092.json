Some Republicans have long claimed that New Hampshire’s same-day registration law, which lets people register on the day of the election, has allowed nonresidents, especially college students in neighboring Massachusetts, to vote. The law requires they show valid identification at the polls. If they do not have such an ID, their picture is taken and they have to sign an oath swearing to their identity and that they are voting legally. After the election, the secretary of state sends out confirmation letters to those voters, who must respond. So far this year, the secretary of state’s office has reported no indications of widespread fraud. What do other Republicans think? Lots of them have emphatically rejected the whole notion of voting fraud, even though some have questioned the state’s same-day registration rules. Steve Duprey, a former Republican state chairman and current national Republican committeeman, wrote on Twitter : “Repeating: there is no voter fraud in NH. None. Zip. Nada. Hundreds of lawyers, poll workers, watchers, press -no buses rolled in.” Thomas D. Rath, a former state attorney general, tweeted : “Allegations of voter fraud in NH are baseless, without any merit — it’s shameful to spread these fantasies.” And Fergus Cullen, a former Republican state chairman, wrote : “I will pay $1000 to 1st person proving even 1 outofstate person took bus from MA 2 any NH polling place last ElectionDay.” What about New Hampshire’s Republican governor? Before the election, Gov. Chris Sununu alleged voter fraud, saying that out-of-state Democrats were being bused in “all over the place.” Asked for evidence, he modified his claim, saying, “I don’t want to imply I see buses coming over.” PolitiFact New Hampshire said Mr. Sununu’s assertion was “ridiculous” and rated it “Pants on Fire.” \nAdvertisement   But unlike Mr. Trump, Mr. Sununu won the state and so for obvious reasons wants to be cautious about asserting fraud. “I’m not aware of any widespread voter fraud in New Hampshire; however the administration has made some strong assertions to the contrary,” he told WMUR.com on Monday. “I take their concerns seriously and look forward to working closely with them to learn of any evidence they may have and help address any concerns that may develop from there.” And Democrats? Not surprisingly, top New Hampshire Democrats roundly reject the claims. “There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of major voter fraud in New Hampshire’s elections,” said Senator Jeanne Shaheen. “President Trump continues to spread a dangerous lie, and it’s long past time for Republican leadership in New Hampshire to stand up and defend our state’s electoral system.” And Ms. Hassan’s spokesman, Aaron Jacobs, said the “completely unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud have been debunked by independent fact checkers time and again.” Articles debunking the claims have been written by The Boston Globe , NPR and The Associated Press , among others. Have others spoken up? A federal election commissioner, Ellen L. Weintraub, said she was so outraged by Mr. Trump’s comments that she was moved to speak out and demand that if he has evidence of fraud, he needs to present it. “This would be a criminal conspiracy involving thousands of people,” she said. She noted that Ms. Ayotte’s race was the most expensive Senate race per capita in the country last year, and that in such a small state, widespread fraud would have been noticed. “It’s not like no one was paying attention to what was going on in New Hampshire,” she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:20:55.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
