But the match was effectively wrapped up for the Stormers by the midway point, when they led 24-0, and after that it really was only a question of whether they’d pick up the bonus point for scoring three more tries than their opponents. \nThat was after as complete a performance from the Cape team as the Stormers supporters in the 35 000 strong crowd could have hoped for, with the Stormers mastering the Bulls at forward, dominating the collisions and the battle for the gainline, and the backs showing off the skills that have been the talk of the camp since the arrival of Kiwi assistant coach Greg Feeney. \nIf the Stormers could be unhappy about something, it could be their failure to grab a try-scoring bonus point. A haul of five log points certainly looked likely at halftime when the Stormers had scored three tries to nil. However, the Bulls struck back immediately after the break through a Hanro Liebenberg try, and while the Stormers did cross the chalk twice more, they ended up with a tally of only five tries to four. This video is not available in your region \nThe tone of the match was set in the third minute, when the Bulls had a ball stolen by Pieter-Steph du Toit at a loose scrum after they had attacked up the left touchline, and the Stormers counter-attacked with interest into the Bulls’ territory. \nThen the first scrum sent out another ominous warning for the Bulls, and it soon became apparent that the Stormers were going to reign supreme in the lineouts too. The Bulls were being smashed backwards by the Stormers in the collisions, and often went backwards in the face of the onslaught, and their skipper Handre Pollard looked jittery at flyhalf, making several mistakes in his first Super Rugby match since 2015. \nThe Stormers might have regretted their decision to twice tap and go from penalties when there were three pointers for the taking, but they made up for that when from a defensive penalty Jano Vermaak tapped quickly and scythed through the Bulls before passing to fullback SP Marais, who wrong-footed the remaining defenders to go over near the posts. The attack took up 60 metres and showed the Stormers' intent. Jean-Luc du Plessis converted and the Stormers were good value for their 7-0 lead after 16 minutes. \nAfter 20 minutes another massive Stormers scrum netted a penalty that made it 10-0 and suddenly the Stormers’ season was well under way and looking impressive. Pollard missed a relatively easy kick for posts after 23 minutes to maintain the pressure on his team, and then it was man of the match Du Toit’s turn to have a say again as he took a long throw at a lineout, new skipper Siya Kolisi rumbled the ball up and it was transferred to the backs going right, and new centre EW Viljoen put Cheslin Kolbe in with a neat little grubber kick. \nDebutant Viljoen, who has good feet and passes well through the tackle, was one of the stand-outs in a Stormers backline that is helped in no small measure by the impressive passing game of flyhalf Du Plessis. \nThe Bulls were making many errors and looked a bit shell-shocked, and it wasn’t too surprising when the Stormers scored again on the stroke of halftime, this time Nizaam Carr going in after another strong Du Toit carry. \nHanro Liebenberg’s try straight after halftime changed the tempo a bit, but the Stormers’ buffer was always going to be too big, particularly as each time the Bulls bothered the scorers in the third quarter, the Stormers would strike straight back with points of their own. \nOne of the most popular tries on the night was scored by Kolisi, who barrelled in down through the short-side to make it 29-5 to the Stormers, and then later it was the turn of wing Dillyn Leyds to cross for the fifth Stormers try in exactly the same corner. \nIn between that Pierre Schoeman had gone over near the posts but Du Plessis had kicked another penalty to retain a 20-point buffer. Lax Stormers defending down the left let Liebenberg in for his second try but Pollard’s failure to convert an earlier try meant that the Stormers were still more than three scores away. That meant that Piet van Zyl’s try on the final whistle was nothing more than a consolation effort.. \nIt was a deserved win for the Stormers set up by a pleasing mix of finesse, skill and brutal physicality, at least in the first half, and certainly on this evidence there is good reason for the Stormers fans to get the Newlands turnstiles clicking in the months to come. \nSCORERS: \nDHL Stormers 37 - Tries: SP Marais, Cheslin Kolbe, Nizaam Carr, Nizaam Carr, Dillyn Leyds; Conversions: Jean-Luc du Plessis 3; Penalty: Jean-Luc du Plessis 2. \nVodacom Bulls 24 – Tries: Hanro Liebenberg 2, Pierre Schoeman and Piet van Zyl; Conversions: Handre Pollard and Tian Schoeman. © supersport.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:49:12.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
