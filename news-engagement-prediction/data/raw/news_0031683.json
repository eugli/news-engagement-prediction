After a five-year trial run, the law would allow similar systems to be installed across California. \nFellow San Francisco lawmakers, state senator Scott Wiener and assemblyman Phil Ting also support the bill, which has drawn opposition from the mayor of San Jose and the Peace Officers Research Association of California, among others. \nOn Sunday, Assemblyman Chiu appeared on KPIX 5 Morning News to discuss and defend his proposed law with Phil Matier. \nWATCH INTERVIEW :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:12:24.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
