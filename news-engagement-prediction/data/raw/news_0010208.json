Metropolitan Police/PA Wire Brizzi, a former Morgan Stanley IT worker at the time of the killing, was found guilty in November of PC Semple's murder \nFollowing an Old Bailey trial, the former Morgan Stanley IT developer was found guilty of murder in November by a majority of 10 to two after the jury had deliberated for more than 30 hours. \nHe was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 24 years in December. \nThe trial was marked by Brizzi’s account of a spiralling crystal meth addiction and tumultuous life in London since he arrived in 2010. Metropolitan Police/PA Archive 59-year-old Pc Gordon Semple was killed by Brizzi after a bondage sex session \nThe court heard that Brizzi was addicted to crystal meth, which had cost him his job at financial giant Morgan Stanley. \nHe had gone to Crystal Meth Anonymous meetings, but upset people by wearing a Breaking Bad T-shirt as the show “glorified” the drug. \nHe told the group he believed in the Devil and liked satanic rituals and he bragged of his bondage sex encounters. \nThe trial heard how Brizzi met his victim on gay dating app Grindr and arranged a “hot dirty sleazy session” at his flat near London’s Tate Modern gallery on April 1. \nAccording to Brizzi, Pc Semple died when a dog leash he had been wearing as part of a sex game slipped. \nBut a pathologist concluded that while strangulation was a possible cause of death, it would have taken minutes rather than moments, as the defendant had claimed. \nIn the days after the killing, crystal meth addict Brizzi was caught on CCTV buying buckets, a perforated metal sheet and cleaning products from a DIY store. He then set about dismembering the body and stripping the flesh. \nMeanwhile, Pc Semple’s long-term partner Gary Meeks raised the alarm and reported him missing when he failed to return to their home in Dartford, in Kent. \nNeighbours complained about the stench coming from Brizzi’s flat and eventually called police who came across the grisly sight of “globules” of flesh floating in the bath, bags containing bones and a part of Pc Semple’s head, and pools of human fat in the oven. \nBrizzi, who was wearing pink underpants and sunglasses, was arrested as officers realised the enormity of what they had found. \nThe court heard there was evidence in the kitchen that Brizzi had chopped up the Inverness-born officer with a variety of utensils and may have even used chopsticks to eat morsels of cooked meat. \nFollowing his arrest, Brizzi admitted killing and trying to dissolve the body of a policeman because “Satan told me to”. \nDuring the killing, he said he had turned away a man on his doorstep who had arrived for a sex party organised on Grindr. \nBrizzi said: “I was right in the middle of strangling Gordon and I said to him ‘Look, this is not the right time now, people are falling ill and it’s a mess’.” \nThe Italian also told police that he had “chucked” some of Pc Semple’s body into the Thames and thrown away his police badge and belongings. \nA human foot was later found by a member of Thames Mudlark Club near Bermondsey Wall.
