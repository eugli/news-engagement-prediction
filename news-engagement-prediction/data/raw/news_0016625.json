The press makes them. Government makes them. I make them, too, and so do you. What's often more revealing about character, however, is what comes after the error is brought to light. \nAnd on that score, the two people that Americans are paying to speak on behalf of their president - presidential adviser Kellyanne Conway and press secretary Sean Spicer - have revealed themselves to be fundamentally ill-suited for the job. \nThey aren't honest, which is a problem only because if they aren't honest, they make our president dishonest. Worse still, when they speak for the president, they are often speaking for the country - and in that way they can make liars of us all. \nOn Thursday night, Conway was on Hardball with Chris Matthews. She defended Trump's controversial travel ban on seven Muslim-majority nations, including Iraq. She seemed to say that folks wouldn't be so upset about it if the press hadn't kept Americans in the dark about the \"Bowling Green massacre\" committed by two Iraqis in 2011. \nExcept as she knew perfectly well, the press covered the 2011 events she was referring to with vigor. They weren't much discussed, however, in relationship to Trump's order because there was no massacre in Bowling Green. No attack of any kind there. Not even a stubbed-toe. \nWhat there had been was the arrests of two Iraqis who admitted that they had been planning to send weapons and money to the Middle East for use there by terrorists fighting U.S. soldiers. The two also admitted that previously, while living in Iraq, they had used IEDs against our soldiers. ( Here are the details from the FBI .) These men -- clearly our enemies -- were sentenced to 40 years in federal prison and to a life term, respectively. 1/2: Honest mistakes abound. Last night, prominent editor of liberal site apologized for almost running a story re: tweet from fake account — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) February 3, 2017 2/2: yet won't name him, attack him, get the base 2 descend upon him. Same with MLKJr bust fake story. It's called class, grace, deep breath — Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) February 3, 2017 \nConway could have said, 'Listen there are dangerous people who come here from Iraq. Even the Obama administration stopped accepting new refugees from there for six months.\" But that wouldn't have made for a good argument for a complete ban on nearly all travel from the seven nations affected by Trump's order. Now when that order was being sold as a way to prevent attacks here in America. Her argument got better when she could say that the men were captured after \"masterminding\" an \"attack\" or \"massacre\" right here in the homeland. For good measure, she tossed in the false claim that they had been \"radicalized\" here in America. \nExcept it didn't happen that way. Not any of it. Lord knows, Matthews should have challenged her right then but he was asleep at the wheel. \nBut like I said earlier, mistakes happen. So why keep harping on hers? Because what reveals her as a dishonest surrogate for the president is the way she responded to her mistakes once they were known. And in that, she has company inside the White House. \nIn her own way, she owned up to the mistake early Friday morning in a two-tweet message on Twitter. \"Honest mistakes abound. Last night, prominent editor of liberal site apologized for almost running a story re: tweet from fake account,\" she said in the first tweet. I guess that counts as an apology from her, even though she didn't actually apologize in the tweet. What she really said was more like ... stuff happens. ... followed immediately by an effort to put the blame on someone else. (I mean, seriously, _ 'almost?') \nWhatever happened to the simple and speedy retraction? Twitter should make it so easy. \"Hey there! I was totally wrong about the Bowling Green events. They were bad guys, but to be clear: There was no attack in Bowling Green.\" \nShe wouldn't have even needed a second tweet. But instead she used another 140 characters to shift from blaming someone else for her mistake to taking credit for doing it in a way that was so classy. \"Yet won't name him, attack him, get the base 2 descend upon him. Same with MLKJr bust fake story. It's called class, grace, deep breath.\" \nAnd what's wrong with that? Nothing, except, deep breath now, it's not classy or graceful. It's not even honest. \nA TIME reporter covering Trump's first day in office made a mistake. Noting other changes in decor, he looked for the bust of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the Oval Office and didn't see it. He added a one-line note about the missing bust to a report sent to hundreds of White House reporters at 7:31 p.m. Friday. People started asking about it right away, and he spent the next 30 minutes trying to get a staffer to confirm whether the bust was or wasn't in the office. \nBy 8 p.m., he had learned he had erred. He sent a correction within two minutes to the White House press corps, and then spent the rest of the evening sending no less than 12 tweets taking responsibility for the error, correcting it, and apologizing. (TIME editor Nancy Gibbs' note to readers is here .) \nFar from letting \"class\" or \"grace\" guide their reaction, the White House -- from Trump to his spokesman -- has savaged the reporter for the error over the past two weeks. Spicer denounced Miller as a liar, without having to use that word or his name, and said the same is true for reporters who -- quite accurately, this time -- reported on the smaller than advertised crowds at Trump's inaugural ceremonies. \n\"Some members of the media were engaged in deliberately false reporting,\" Spicer fumed at an extraordinary press conference on the evening of Trump's first full day in office. \"For all the talk about the proper use of Twitter, two instances yesterday stand out. One was a particularly egregious example in which a reporter falsely tweeted out that the bust of Martin Luther King, Jr. had been removed from the Oval Office. After it was pointed out that this was just plain wrong, the reporter casually reported and tweeted out and tried to claim that a Secret Service agent must have just been standing in front of it. This was irresponsible and reckless.\" \nTo call Miller's mistake irresponsible or reckless is one thing. But to call it \"deliberately false\" is slander. And more to the point, it's plainly dishonest. Thirty-six hours after his tongue-lashing performance before the press corps, Spicer took questions in his first official White House press conference. When asked bluntly by an ABC reporter whether he intended to tell the truth from the podium, Spicer demurred. As much as possible, he said. \nBesides, he said, reporters ought to know that sometimes even honest people get things wrong. \n\"I think sometimes we can disagree with the facts,\" Spicer said, apparently without irony. \"There are certain things that we may not fully understand when we come out. But our intention's never to lie to you ... and you're in the same boat. There are times when you guys tweet something out or write a story, and you publish a correction. That doesn't mean that you were trying to deceive readers and the American people, does it? And I think we should be afforded the same opportunity. \n\"... If we make a mistake, we'll do our best to correct it. But ... it is a two-way street. There are many mistakes that the media makes all the time. They misreport something, they don't report something, they get a fact wrong. I don't think that's always -- you know, to turn around and say, okay, 'You were intentionally lying.'\" \nWell, right. Except 36 hours before, that's precisely what he did say. OK? \nSo when Conway defends her own error by explaining that everyone else gets stuff wrong, too, and cites as an example a story that \"almost\" published and Miller's mistake two weeks ago, she's just reminding everyone not to take her at face value. \nThat wouldn't matter, not even a little, but she's being paid by the American people to work for our president. If she can't be trusted to simply admit when she's wrong, she isn't doing anyone, certainly not the president, any good.
