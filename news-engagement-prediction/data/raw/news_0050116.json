The water was about 15 feet deep in that area. A 9-year-old boy who was skating on the pond  attempted to save the man who fell through the ice, but he also fell into the icy water.\nSeveral bystanders came to the aid of both of the victims. One rescuer was able to pull the boy out of the water. Several attempts were also made to rescue the man, but all were unsuccessful.\nNorfolk County Fire and Rescue Services tried to recover the submerged victim on Saturday. The attempt was eventually suspended due to safety concerns.\nOn Sunday around 12:15 p.m., the OPP Underwater Search and Recovery Unit found the man's body. 68-year-old Jani Daliyanazlou of Hamilton was pronounced deceased by the attending coroner.\nThe OPP are thanking the good samaritans who saved the boy's life.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:10:08.244+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
