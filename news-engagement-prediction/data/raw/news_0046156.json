Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAs a grandmother of nine, former Great British Bake Off winner Nancy Birtwhistle knows that children want food quickly. \nWhether it's a proper meal or some chocolate chip buns, they usually can't be bothered to hang around waiting for it. \nThey can also be very messy in the kitchen - or completely uninterested in eating the food lovingly placed in front of them. \nSo, Nancy, originally from Hull, has revealed her top tips for baking with kids - such as using fondant instead of icing to decorate cakes. \nThe 62-year-old has also unveiled some of her favourite, simple recipes that parents can make with their budding little chefs. \n\"I have always baked,\" she told Mirror Online. \nSCROLL DOWN FOR NANCY'S FAVOURITE RECIPES Faithful Friends chocolate chip cupcakes are \"ultra simple\" to make - scroll down for the recipe (Photo: Nancy Birtwhistle) Read More \n\"I used to bake as a child with my grandmother. We'd make Christmas puddings. In those days, everyone did their own really. \n\"What I find with children is they want things quickly.\" \nNancy explained that, with her own grandchildren, she sometimes makes pizzas, which they are able to decorate themselves. \nThis, she said, makes them more interested in their food. \nThe ex-Bake Off champion described how she makes the dough and leaves it to rise, before tasking her grandkids with rolling it out. \nShe then places sliced-up peppers, grated cheese and any other ingredients in bowls - which the youngsters can use to decorate their dough. \n\"They then know which pizza is theirs and they eat it,\" said the gran, who has just launched a 365-day interactive social media challenge . \nShe added that the kids may not be as interested in a shop-bought pizza. \nNancy, married to husband Tim, also revealed how, when making buns with her grandchildren, she typically uses fondant instead of icing. Nancy also recommends tropical flapjack as a perfect, child-friendly recipe (Photo: Nancy Birtwhistle) \nShe said this means the youngsters can decorate the buns while they are still warm - without having to wait a while for them to cool down. \n\"They can roll out the fondant and put it on the warm bun,\" she said. \"It's also less messy than having icing dripping all over.\" \nNancy said some of her favourite buns to bake are Faithful Friends chocolate chip cupcakes ( recipe at the bottom of this article ). \nThese cakes are \"ultra simple\" for parents to make with their children - and are also fun for little ones to decorate, she told Mirror Online. \nShe also recommends tropical flapjack as a perfect, child-friendly recipe . \nShe said the flapjack, which is \"adored by children and adults alike\", is \"so easy\" to make and a fantastic recipe for those new to baking. \n\"It is a traditional, low cost bake but this one has a fruity taste and is a real favourite in our house,\" she said. \nShe added that the flapjack will keep for a week in a tin. \nNancy was a huge fan of Bake Off when she applied for Series Five on BBC One. \nAt the time, she was bored of retirement, after working full-time for three decades. Nancy was a huge fan of Bake Off when she applied for Series Five on BBC One (Photo: BBC) \n\"When I first retired there didn't seem to be a lot of purpose in anything,\" she said. \n\"You miss the company at work, you miss young people. \n\"They're often where you get your laughs.\" \nBut, since winning the competition, she said 20 years have been \"knocked off\" her. \n\"I have got a lot of what I missed back now in all sorts of environments,\" she told Mirror Online. \"My life is enriched.\" \nDuring the show, Nancy said she took the contest \"seriously\" - and feared the thought of going out in the first week. \nShe said she initially experienced self-doubt, asking herself: \"Should I really be here?\" But her confidence soon grew. \n\"When I got star baker the first week I felt confident about being there,\" she said. \n\"I actually learned a little bit about myself, that I didn't get incredibly nervous.\" \nNancy, a former Practice Manager at a GP surgery, revealed how she and her fellow contestants all gelled very quickly. \nEven today, three years on, they all stay in touch on social media. \n\"We have a WhatsApp group. It's been a great thing,\" she said. \nWhen she discovered she had won Bake Off, months before the result was made public, Nancy had to keep it a secret. \nAnd so did her loved ones. \n\"I knew I'd won at the end of June,\" she said. \n\"My grandson Ethan, who was then 11 or 12, was my biggest fear. It would have done his street cred so much good to say, 'Oh my granny wins Bake Off.'\" \nFortunately, Ethan kept the news quiet. \nSince the programme, Nancy told Mirror Online she has been asked by publishers whether she would like to write a recipe book. \nSo far, she has declined to do so, because there are already \"so many out there\". \nInstead, she has launched an interactive social media challenge, which will see her share her vast knowledge of cooking and recipes on online platforms. \nShe also plans to share a huge array of garden and home tips with thousands of Twitter , Facebook and Instagram users.

And to be honest, before I won Bake Off, neither did I! But it’s such an amazing platform and I am now really embracing everything about it.\" \nShe added: “I have decided to launch my 365 Challenge to share daily my recipes, food, garden and home ideas with everyone. It’s very interactive and I really want to encourage everyone to tweet or message me their questions or thoughts.
