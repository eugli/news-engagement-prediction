Richard Tribou will make an announcement about new exoplanet findings today at 1 p.m.\nThe details of the findings appear in the science journal Nature, and are embargoed until 1 p.m., but regard Earth-like planets in a neighboring star system. \nInvolved in today’s briefing are Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington; Michael Gillon, astronomer at the University of Liege in Belgium; Sean Carey, manager of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at Caltech/IPAC, Pasadena, California; Nikole Lewis, astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore; and Sara Seager, professor of planetary science and physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge. \nThe Spitzer Space Telescope has been involved along with Hubble Space Telescope in the search for exoplanets, planets not in our solar system. Researchers are looking for exoplanets in the habitable zone, meaning those that might have water, the basis for life on Earth. \nOne of the panelists, Gillon, has previously published works on exoplanets using the Spitzer Space Telescope, having found three exoplanets in a system just shy of 40 light years away . \nFollowing the 1 p.m. announcement, a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) about exoplanets will be held at 3 p.m. \nYou can view the announcement at 1 p.m. on NASA TV at http://www.nasa.gov/nasatv Caption Rocket launches set to return to NASA property \nThis weekend's scheduled SpaceX rocket launch will be the first on NASA property in five years. \nThis weekend's scheduled SpaceX rocket launch will be the first on NASA property in five years.
