But even a guy like him could use a break once in a while. \nPerhaps that’s why the New England Patriots quarterback agreed to make an appearance on “Conan,” facing off against Atlanta Falcons defensive end Dwight Freeney for the late-night television show’s “Clueless Gamer” segment. \nThe spot will feature the two NFL veterans attempting to play video games, and if the 2015 “Clueless Gamer” bit with Rob Gronkowski and Marshawn Lynch was any indication, it should be a good time. \nBrady and Freeney gave us a sneak preview of the segment, which airs Thursday night at 11 p.m. ET on TBS. Here's a sneak preview of tonight’s #CluelessGamer featuring #Superbowl rivals Tom Brady and @DwightFreeney .

We’ll see if that changes after Brady’s little jab here — or after the results of Super Bowl Sunday. \nEither way, we hope TB12 is better on the joysticks than teammate Martellus Bennett . \nThumbnail photo via Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports Images \nHave a question for Darren Hartwell?
