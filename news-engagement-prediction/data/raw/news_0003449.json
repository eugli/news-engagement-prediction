PUBLISHED: 08:28,   INSTAGRAM The sister-in-law of Michael Buble has insisted that his son Noah is 'doing well' \nNutritionist Daniela Lopilato, who is the sister of Michael's wife Luisana, posted a tweet last night after an Argentinian journalist claimed he had spoken to her. \n\"Don’t use my name in the media with information and things that I haven’t said. Noah is doing well and his parents will speak when they want to,\" she wrote on her Twitter page, which has 36.6k followers. \nEarlier that day, Tomas Dente alleged that Daniela had told him: \"The cancer has gone,\" after he contacted her for an update on the three-year-old's condition. No usen más mi nombre en los medios con detalles y cosas q no dije. Noah está bien y los papas hablaran cuando ellos quieran!
