Seth Rollins has in fact injured his knee yet again. \nThe wrestling world went into meltdown when the news first broke on WWE.com, with many initially believing it was for storyline purposes to further advance the feud between Triple H and Rollins before an eventual clash at WrestleMania 33. KNEE INJURY \nHowever, as entertaining as Samoa Joe’s Monday Night Raw debut may have been, he played a part in injuring Rollins in the middle of the ring after he locked in his vicious Coquina Clutch.

Article continues below \nThe good news, as of this writing, is that he won’t be missing the same amount of time as he did last time. \nThey’re claiming that based on his medical evaluation on Wednesday, he has reportedly torn his MCL. \nIf that’s the case, then Rollins is expected to miss eight weeks of action which, on paper, means he should be able to make it back for WrestleMania 33 – but it’s going to be close. EIGHT WEEKS \nThe newsletter published: “Rollins was getting an evaluation on 2/1 in Birmingham and the early word was that he’d be out about eight weeks, meaning that ‘Mania was possible but not definite. \n“Obviously, he’ll want to do it under any circumstances when it’s that close of a call but WWE these days, for legal reasons, is far more cautious about throwing talent back into the ring before they are ready has been the case historically.” \nIt looks like the clock is now against Rollins, as he’ll want to prove he’s healthy enough to compete, but it doesn’t seem like WWE will take unnecessary risks, especially at an event of that magnitude. \nShould WWE allow Seth Rollins to compete at WrestleMania 33 if it’s a close call?
