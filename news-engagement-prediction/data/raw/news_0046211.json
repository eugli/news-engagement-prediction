Could there be life on exoplanets? \nNASA and other space agencies believe that exoplanets offer the best hope of finding alien life. \nSpecifically, they are looking for Earth-like planets in the “habitable zone”– the distance from a star which allows a planet to have liquid oceans. \nScientists also take into consideration other criteria such as the greenhouse effect of a planet’s atmosphere. \nNASA says that “the ultimate goal of [its] exoplanet program is to find unmistakable signs of current life”. GETTY An exoplanet is a planet that orbits a star other than the Sun \nIt adds: “How soon that can happen depends on two unknowns: the prevalence of life in the galaxy and how lucky we get as we take those first, tentative, exploratory steps.” \nIt is estimated that the search for signs of life could take decades due to the sheer number of planets and limitations of current space telescopes. \nNASA is currently working on its next-generation planet finder, which will be launched into space in the 2030s or 2040s. GETTY Scientists estimate that there is at least one planet orbiting every star in our galaxy How will we know if there is life on exoplanets? \nScientists analyse light reflected through the atmosphere of an exoplanet to identify signs of life. \nWhen light is sent through an atmosphere, it is split into a rainbow-like spectrum of colours. \nCertain chemicals and gases can absorb slices of this spectrum, leaving behind a narrow black gap. GETTY Scientists believe that exoplanets are the best hope of finding alien life \nThese gaps indicate which chemicals are present in the planet’s atmosphere and could show signs of oxygen, methane or pollutants created by aliens . \nIt is possible that alien life could be completely different from life on Earth, and could create a host of different gases. \nIn anticipation of this scenario, MIT physics professor Sara Seager has come up with a roster of possible chemical combinations that could signal life that is not as we know it.
