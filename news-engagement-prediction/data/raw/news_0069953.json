The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) In his press conference last week , in which President Trump ranted and raved that he wasn't ranting and raving, he answered a question about his wife, Melania. \"That's what I call a very nice question,\" he said, apparently relieved to stop talking about his own policies, before saying the first lady feels very strongly about \"women's issues\" and \"women's difficulties.\" Trump didn't specify what these \"issues\" and \"difficulties\" might be. One presumes that, despite the phrasing, he probably meant things like equal pay and health care, and not what old men usually mean when they cryptically speak about our \"difficulties.\" He then swiftly regressed into thin-skinned indignation, complaining that despite the first lady's strength as an advocate for women, \"she gets so unfairly maligned.\" Donald Trump calls treatment of Melania Trump 'unfair' Observers of this White House may be wondering when, exactly, Mrs Trump became a feminist advocate. Unless you count her general abdication of some archaic and deeply silly first lady duties -- Mrs. Trump prefers her New York penthouse over the White House, prompting concerns she won't adequately oversee flower arrangements and the annual Easter Egg roll -- she isn't exactly a feminist firebrand. In framing her as an advocate for women's rights when there is close to zero evidence she has ever actually advocated for women's rights, Trump told us more about himself than he did about her: Women are good for photo ops, not for real positions of power. Read More You see this as well in Trump's treatment of his daughter, Ivanka (and in Ivanka's own corporate-friendly, faux feminism). Ivanka tweeted a photo of herself sitting at her dad's desk in the Oval Office, flanked by the President and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, along with a caption about the importance of giving women \"a seat at the table.\" Of course, it is Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, who has an actual position on the Trump team, and not Ivanka herself. According to Trump , Ivanka is also a \"great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing.\" It's tempting to hope that perhaps Trump is right and the two leading ladies in his life are stealth feminist forces in the White House. Ivanka has her Women Who Work campaign, which claims to champion the rights of working women. And while Melania may attend the Easter Egg roll after all, she's at least asserting her own desire to be the first lady she wants to be, not the one a sexist history demands. Dig a little deeper, though, and both Melania and Ivanka don't look so feminist after all; they look prototypically Trump. At the rally President Trump held in Florida over the weekend, Melania said that as first lady, she would be supporting initiatives \"dear to her heart\" which would have an \"impact on women and children all around the world\". But in the same rare public address, she borrowed some of her husband's favorite language, describing the media as \"the opposition.\" JUST WATCHED", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:49:53.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
