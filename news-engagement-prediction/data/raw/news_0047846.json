And I haven't shaved my head yet.\" (Photo: Getty Images North America) Read More Grammy Awards 2017 best dressed stars: Adele, Carrie Underwood, Paris Jackson and Heidi Klum steal the show \nRyan then changed the subject, but Katy also made the reference during another interview with CBS. \nAnd following her comments, one angry fan wrote on Twitter: \"OK FINE I turned on the Grammys and Katy Perry was making a snide ‘Britney breakdown head-shaving’ reference & I'm not down with that. \nAnother said: “I just lost all my respect for Katy Perry, well the litle respect I did have for her.” \nA #KatyPerryIsOver hashtag also popped up, much like the one her fans created for Taylor Swift last year.
