And if you were present (sorry) at the event, you got some A+ Cate, as the actress lip-synched several numbers and, watching the clips from the night, it’s all pretty fever-dream, “Wait, this actually happened?” Outfitted in a stylish black jacket, accessorized with some dramatic red lipstick, Blanchett performed Dusty Springfield’s “You Don’t Own Me” (in some staggering earrings), giving it a high-drama treatment that surely has already been mimicked by at least 50 vloggers in tribute videos since.

Loading View on Instagram Cate Blanchett’s life just seems impossibly fun, no? She always seems as if she is having a ball, not taking anything too seriously, while at the same time exuding extreme elegance and intelligence.
