Unfortunately, he’s earned the titles of “irrational” and “volatile” as he once again leads the league in technical fouls, now just one away from receiving his second suspension of the 2016-2017 campaign for going over the NBA’s season limit of 16. \nHowever, Cousins’ reputations does not define him as a player (or as a human for that matter). Whether it’s the millions of dollars he’s donated to charities without parading the act as a publicity stunt, or his relentless involvement within the Sacramento community throughout his tenure with the franchise, Cousins is more than the hothead he may appear on the court.

Before joining his new team, the Kings’ all-star gave a heartfelt goodbye to members of the only NBA organization he’s ever known — warning: grab some tissues before hitting play. My friend got transferred to another city because of his job. He had some things to say.
