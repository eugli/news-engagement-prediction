The final figure of today's voting is still awaited as all those who were inside the polling booths will be allowed to vote, an election official spokesman said here. \n\nShortly before the polling was to end, Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal \"thanked Punjabis for peaceful polling and reposing faith in SAD-BJP alliance.\" \n\nA statement issued by Badal's spokesman quoted him as saying, \"Moved by people's love despite negative agenda.\" \n\nHowever, this time around 70 per cent out of the total 1.98 crore electors exercised their franchise to seal the fate of 1,145 candidates including Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, his son and Deputy, Sukhbir Singh Badal , Cabinet Minister Bikram Singh Majithia and Punjab Congress President and the party's chief ministerial candidate, Capt Amarinder Singh. \n\nThe total number of electors in the state is 1,98,79,069, including 93,75,546 females.
