Gent are rewarded for their victory with a tie against fellow Belgian side Genk - that's going to get very confusing for commentators and pundits alike. \nAnother pick of the ties is an all-German clash between Schalke and Monchengladbach, which should be a cracking set of games. \nHigh-scoring Lyon, who beat AZ Alkmaar 11-2 on aggregate in the round of 32, will take on one of the tournament favourites in Roma - who are currently second in Serie A. \nThat fixture is perhaps best known for Amantino Mancini's step-over masterclass, which you can relive here: \nHere are the ties in full: \nCelta Vigo vs FC Krasnodar \nAPOEL vs Anderlecht \nFC Schalke vs Borussia Monchengladbach \nLyon vs AS Roma \nFC Rostov vs Manchester United \nOlympiakos vs Besiktas", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T15:16:03.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
