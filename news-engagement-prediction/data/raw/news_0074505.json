This year, the late-night comedian is in charge of hosting the annual Academy Awards, and there has been plenty of comic book material for him to play with. Not long ago, Suicide Squad took home an Oscar for Best Makeup and Hair Styling. And, a moment ago, Kimmel namedropped one of last year’s most lucrative superhero flicks. \nYes, that’s right! Kimmel took to the stage and made a pointed joke about Doctor Strange . The film, which is nominated for Outstanding Visual Effects, got a hat-tip from Kimmel that pitted it against the issue of politics. \n\" Doctor Strange was nominated for Outstanding Visual Effects & was also named Secretary of Housing And Urban Development,” Kimmel joked. \nOf course, Doctor Strange would be an interesting choice to take on the secretarial position. While Stephen may not have the temperament for government affairs, the sorcerer supreme could do a lot to a city’s landscape. Audiences watched as characters like Kaecilius and the Ancient One upended bustling cities like London. And, of course, Doctor Strange himself turned back the hands of time to reconstruct Hong Kong after Dormammu was summoned at the film’s end. \nFrom Marvel comes DOCTOR STRANGE, the story of world-famous neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange whose life changes forever after a horrific car accident robs him of the use of his hands. When traditional medicine fails him, he is forced to look for healing, and hope, in an unlikely place – a mysterious enclave known as Kamar-Taj. He quickly learns that this is not just a center for healing but also the front line of a battle against unseen dark forces bent on destroying our reality. Before long Strange – armed with newly acquired magical powers – is forced to choose whether to return to his life of fortune and status or leave it all behind to defend the world as the most powerful sorcerer in existence. Join Strange on his dangerous, mystifying, and totally mind-bending journey. \nThe cast features Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock, Star Into Darkness, The Imitation Game), Chiwetel Ejiofor (12 Years a Slave), Rachel McAdams (Sherlock Holmes), Michael Stuhlbarg (A Serious Man), Mads Mikkelsen (Casino Royale), and Tilda Swinton (The Grand Budapest Hotel). \nDoctor Strange will appear next in Thor: Ragnarok , and is also due to appear in Avengers: Infinity War, which began principal photography this week. Doctor Strange hits digital HD February 14, and DVD/Blu-ray on February 28. \nDid you love the movie? If so, let us know below with our Composite Score below!
