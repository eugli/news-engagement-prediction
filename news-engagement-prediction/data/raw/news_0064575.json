This is not only meanspirited and misguided, but it is also dangerous. Transgender young people already experience bullying and harassment at alarming rates, along with increased rates of depression and suicide. Removing these protections further stigmatizes these students. As a psychiatrist, I have witnessed firsthand the negative effects of such discrimination. Next month, the Supreme Court will also bear witness to them as Gavin Grimm, a transgender student from Virginia, brings his case to the court . Transgender young people deserve our protection and respect. Instead, President Trump has decided that political capital is worth more than the lives of transgender students. JEREMY D. KIDD The writer is chief resident in psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story To the Editor: One consistent theme with President Trump is that when in doubt you can count on him to go after the vulnerable. Whether they are immigrants, refugees, Muslims or transgender people, he relies on bullying to promote himself. In fact, his entire “America first” theme amounts to America bullying the world. Of course, we know that the only way to deal with a bully is to stand up to him, and people are doing just that whether in courtrooms or on the streets. It is one aspect of the political climate that offers hope. People seem up for the fight and are reaching out to one another to offer support. The America that President Trump reaches out to through his bullying is real, but it is not a true picture of America. In a way I feel sorry for him, because the bully is never secure in his own skin and eventually fails and fails badly. He may pick on the vulnerable along the way, but those who may be vulnerable to his tactics today should not be taken for weak. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
