It's just awful to see. \n\"They crumble because all the control in their life has been taken away as well so you have to try, in some way, to give some of that degree of control back to them.\" 'I genuinely wanted to help people' \nDespite the sadness that often accompanies the work, Mr Merrick said he found great satisfaction in helping people through incredibly difficult times. \nOne story particularly resonated with him. \n\"Christine Simpson was the mother of Ebony Simpson, a little girl who was nine when she was murdered some years ago now,\" he said. \n\"I became very close to Christine over the years and the murder was such that I would find it very difficult to understand how a mother would go on and live her life.
