(CBS4) – The hunt is on for whomever broke into the Adaptive Action Sports office at Copper Mountain and stole ski gear, cameras and thousands of dollars worth of prosthetic limbs. \nAccording to the nonprofit’s Facebook page, the burglary happened overnight at their office in the ski area’s village. Images of Brett Botelho’s gear that was stolen (credit: CBS) \nAdaptive athlete Brett Botelho told CBS4 two of his leg prosthetics are missing along with his snowboard bag of gear. They are valued at more than $40,000, he said. \n“I can’t believe someone would do this,” Botelho said. \nThe athletes say if the person returns the things that were stolen they won’t press charges, and no questions will be asked. \nAnyone with any information about the case that might be helpful to investigators is asked to call the Summit County Sheriff’s department. \nMatt Kroschel covers news throughout Colorado working from the CBS4 Mountain Newsroom.
