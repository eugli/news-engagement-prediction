According to the leaked slide seen below, the feature is called \"Motion Eye\", and it looks like it's going to take advantage of Sony's latest camera sensor (which has its own dedicated memory module). Apparently, Motion Eye will let your Xperia phone snap 4 photos in the second before you hit the shutter button, once it automatically detects movement. While this may be new for Sony handsets, it doesn't seem to be something that hasn't been done yet. The feature appears to resemble Apple's Live Photos , which captures motion both before, and after you're snapping a picture, thus creating moving images. As you may know, Live Photos debuted on the iPhone 6s series back in 2015. Another relatively similar feature is Samsung's Motion Photo that's available on the Galaxy S7 family.Sony's Motion Eye may be included on two upcoming high-end phones allegedly called Xperia XZs and Xperia XZ Premium. The XZ Premium could pack a 4K display and a Snapdragon 835 processor , succeeding the Xperia Z5 Premium from late 2015 (pictured above). Sony will host a media event at MWC 2017 next week, on February 27. The company should announce multiple new smartphones then, though the Xperia XZs and XZ Premium might be unveiled at a later date, as they're not expected to hit shelves before June. It remains to be seen if Sony will mention the Motion Eye feature at MWC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:49:09.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
