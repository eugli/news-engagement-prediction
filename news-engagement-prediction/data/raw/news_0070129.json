Bobby Rush on Feb. 23, 2017, to start voting and showing up for work. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) Nick Swedberg Daily Southtown Privacy Policy \nHundreds of protesters from a progressive group taking cues from a Tea Party playbook gathered at congressional offices across Illinois Thursday encouraging elected officials to push harder against President Donald Trump and Republicans . \n\"The Trump agenda and the GOP agenda is so appalling. We feel the majority of American believe that it is time for us to wake up and fight back,\" said Jeff Radue, a Beverly resident and local organizer for Indivisible. \nGroups and groups across the country have been founded to organize around the Indivisible Guide, a manual drafted by former Democratic staffers that borrows heavily from Tea Party tactics. \nLocal Indivisible groups, including ones made up of people from the Illinois 1st and 3rd Congressional districts, rallied and called for action from Democratic congressmen to oppose Trump and adopt more progressive stances on issues. \nRadue, who heads the 1st District group, called for Rep. Bobby Rush to step down due to long absences from Washington. He said it was their top concern with the longtime 1st Congressional District congressman. \nRush has made it publicly known since 2014 that he has been caring for his wife, Carolyn, and has spent much of his time in his Chicago congressional offices to be closer to her. \n\"We do respect Congressman Rush, his history and his service. And we also respect his need to take care of his family,\" said Radue, who heads the Indivisible Illinois 1st group. But if Rush \"is incapable of being present due to family health concerns, he should step down and work with the community to find a qualified replacement.\" \nIndivisible Chicago, a Chicago-area group formed to counteract the Trump administration's agenda, is reaching out to U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush to promote its progressive agenda. \nRush, who did not mention the group's top concern in an interview Thursday morning, said he supported Indivisible \"on the issues, most of the issues, 90 percent of them.\" \n\"As a lifelong organizer, I appreciate them and I respect them and, frankly, I'm inspired by them,\" Rush said. \nThe congressman's office has sent letters to the Trump administration and welcomes a potential sit down, especially to address comments the president has made about ongoing violence and the suggestion of sending troops to Chicago, Rush said. \n\"Get off your rump, Trump, and come to Chicago,\" he said Thursday. \nAbout 150 protesters converged on Rush's office. Many taped form letters bearing their name to the office's windows. \nAbout 50 people gathered on the sidewalk Thursday afternoon on Archer Avenue outside Rep. Dan Lipinski 's office. Members of Indivisible met with the conservative Democratic congressman from Illinois 3rd District on Tuesday. He spent Thursday in Lockport and was not scheduled to be present for the rally.

Osorio / Chicago Tribune) \nSeveral protesters said they were concerned with Lipinski's views on social issues, in particular his voting record on women's issues. \n\"He doesn't promote any of the social issues that affect the civil rights of people,\" said Jim Longino, another local organizer for Indivisible. \n\"We were united in the fact that we want him to stand up and represent us. And if he does that, we will back him. But if he does not, we will be holding him accountable,\" Longino said. \nWhile Lipinski has a conservative record, most of what the congressman supports is in line with what the members have stated they want, said Jerry Hurckes, Lipinski's chief of staff. \nLipinski didn't vote the for the Affordable Care Act, which some members of the grassroots groups are concerned that Republicans will repeal, Hurckes said. \nBut Hurckes said Lipinski has opposed every vote by Republican to repeal the act. He expressed doubts that congressional Republicans will march forward with a repeal based on the \"the yelling and screaming they have heard over the last several weeks.\" \nNick Swedberg is a freelance reporter for the Daily Southtown.
