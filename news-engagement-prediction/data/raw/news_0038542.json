Physical therapy can help you build muscle, improve breathing, and clear your lungs. \nPulmonary patients often do aerobic training similar to what heart patients do. Then, they add additional strengthening and breathing exercises to optimize breathing patterns and oxygen intake. “Another big part is the hands-on care from the chest physical therapist, where they will actually give little taps and percussions and vibrations to the chest wall to help clear the mucus out of a particular segment of lung,” says Dr. Whiteson. For this, a PT who has trained in chest physical therapy is the way to go. 5/7 Getty Images Reduce Jaw, Head, and Neck Pain \nBad posture and excessive stress can contribute to temporomandibular joint dysfunction, or TMD, one of the main causes of jaw pain. Bad posture can alter your bite or force your muscles to work harder, and stress can lead to nighttime teeth grinding . “Most of the males I’ve seen are college students,” says Anthony DiFilippo, PT, DPT, OCS, CSCS, president of the Ohio Physical Therapy Association. “And I’ve seen quite a few pilots. So both sitting quite a bit, high stress.” \nBad posture can also contribute to neck pain andtension headaches. For these problems, DiFilippo typically starts with manual therapy to loosen up muscles and tissue. Then he moves to postural exercises that can treat and prevent the problem. 6/7 Getty Images Ease Your Back Aches \nLow back pain is by far the most common problem DiFilippo treats. Postural exercises can help, but active therapy is the way to go, he says. Depending on the cause of your pain, a PT can lead you through exercises where you bend forwards or backwards to counterbalance your typical postures. “A person who is younger and is sitting quite a lot, we try to get them to avoid postures that mimic sitting because they’re doing that all day anyway,” DiFilippo says. “We put them on the exact opposite.” \nA core stability program comes next to help you engage supporting core muscles more fully. After that, it’s up to you to continue doing the exercises your PT recommends on your own.
