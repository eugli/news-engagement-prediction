Campbell, after being recognized, is expected to hand the game ball to Titans coach Bacari Alexander. \n“It’s a proud moment,” Campbell said this week. “I work for the greatest (police) department in the country, and went to the greatest school in the country. I’m forever in debt to them both.” \nCampbell and her partner, police Cpl. Robert Nill, a field training officer, arrived at the freeway overpass in Detroit around 7:30 a.m. to assist the primary unit, officers Eric Brown and Sean Bell. \nWith Detroit police, firefighters and Michigan State Police at the scene, the unidentified 51-year-old man stood on the overpass ledge, staring down at passing cars on the freeway. \nThat’s when the 24-year-old Campbell, who joined the police department last April, stepped into action. \n“First, I asked him, ‘What’s going on in your life?’ I tried to understand where he was coming from,” Campbell said. “He didn’t want to talk much. He kept saying that he was dizzy from watching the traffic.” \nCampbell continued dialogue with the man. \n“I told him to turn around and grab the fence so he wouldn’t lose his balance,” she said. “He was like, ‘Nobody cares about me. I don’t want to be here anymore. I just want to die.’” \nCampbell was not deterred.

We wouldn’t be here if we didn’t,’” she told the man. “I said, ‘You have a lot to live for. This isn’t going to happen. I’m not going to let it happen.' ” \nAfter nearly an hour, the man came down from the ledge. He was taken to Detroit Receiving Hospital Crisis Center for treatment. \n“She (Campbell) has displayed the type of leadership and valor which has become synonymous with the Detroit Police Department,” read a statement on the department’s Facebook page. “Her actions, and that of her fellow officers, resulted in a man’s life being saved.” \nCampbell's path to service was rooted at an early age. Her father, Charles McCollum, was a pastor, and her mother, Becky McCollum, long had served as an infant teacher at Meadow Montessori School in Monroe. Campbell initially planned to become a social worker, but shifted gears before earning a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and master's degree in intelligence analysis at Detroit Mercy. \n“I never wanted a 9-5 job where you sit at a desk,” Campbell said. “To sit at a desk really isn’t my forte. ... I like being on the streets and helping people. For them to ask for your help is an honor. At the end of the day, we’re all human beings and come from the same cloth. \n“I grew up in a household where you were taught to treat others how you want to be treated. My father would give the shirt off his back for anybody and expect nothing in return. My parents made me into the person I am today.” \nCampbell, a soccer forward, scored 17 goals and had 14 assists while playing for Detroit Mercy from 2010-13. She had five game-winning goals before serving as a graduate assistant coach and earning her master's. \nDetroit Mercy soccer coach Mike Lupenec wasn’t surprised to learn of Campbell’s heroics. Campbell played 68 games for the Titans and was named All-Horizon League Second Team as a junior. She also played lacrosse as a college freshman, and joined the basketball and softball teams as a senior. \n“She was always a very positive young lady, on and off the field,” Lupenec said. “She’s a great role model, and we’re proud of everything she does. We have kids in our program that look up to her. Everything she does in life, she works hard.” \nCampbell, who credits Detroit Mercy for preparing her for life after college, feels blessed to be a police officer. \n“People come to Detroit because this is the best police department in the country. The Detroit Police Department is the gold standard,” she said. “I love Detroit because I’m a Titan. My heart is here and I’m fortunate to have a job here.” CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:21:29.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
