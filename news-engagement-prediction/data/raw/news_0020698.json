Lordsburg, New Mexico - After 27-years coaching football at Lordsburg High School, Louie Baisa has announced his retirement. Baisa coached the Mavericks to 187 victories and two state championships (2006 and 2016). He was the New Mexico High School Coaches Association Coach of the Year during the 2010 and 2017 season.\n\"It's been on my mind for some time now. Really two years in the making of this decision. It's time, I knew it was going to happen, and me being 65-years old now I am not hopping around like I used to,\" Said Baisa on Thursday afternoon.\nBaisa led the Mavericks to the Class 2A State Football Championship this past season going 8-2 and beating Ft. Sumner 34-26 in the finals. In 2006 the Mavericks defeated the Santa Rosa Lions 20-10.\n\"That first state championship really stands out when I look back at my career. That was the first time in school history Lordsburg had ever won a football state championship, this past year's state championship, of course, means a lot, but that first one was special.\"\nBaisa's Mavericks snapped Animas' 69-Game Winning Streak\nIn 1990 when Baisa took over the Lordsburg Mavericks, rival Animas was riding the nation's longest football winning streak of 69 games. The Mavericks defeated Animas 9-8 off a Robert Gandara 34-yard field goal. Animas had not lost since the 1984 season.\n\"That win over Animas really stands out. I had just taken the job that season, so really it was my 6th or 7th career victory and since I'd been around the Lordsburg Program as a JV and Junior High assistant all I heard through all those years was Animas Football. So that victory over Animas was a real highlight when I look back on 27-years of football.\"\nWhat's Next\nBaisa says he'll take it as it comes and plans to stay as the school's athletic director. \"We have a new high school being built and it will be nice to be a part of it for a year or so. I also help out with track and field and will continue that moving forward.\nWhat Will He Miss Most?\n\"Growing up I always wanted to be the head coach at Lordsburg High School. I was blessed to do something I wanted to for 27-years. A lot of the success that we've had comes from the community support, so when we win games, district titles, or a state championship, those belong to the entire City of Lordsburg. I told the players yesterday that I was retiring. I'll miss the connections you develop with young men the most. When you're on a team you have a common goal, so leaving that will be very difficult.\"\nNew Mexico Hall of Honor Bound?\nBeing inducted into the New Mexico Hall of Honor is one of the biggest achievements a high school coach in New Mexico can receive. \"It would mean a great deal to be inducted into the Hall of Honor, but that is not up to me. If it happens, it happens, but yes that would be such a great honor.\"\nAfter 27 seasons of Maverick Football, my Dad, Coach Louie Baisa, announced his retirement. I love these two so much. pic.twitter.com/WFxklgHuQA\nâ€” Sonia Trujillo (@SonTru) February 9, 2017 Edit", "external_links": ["https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/dioarrfhiqcpiyyhjtsd)", "https://res-2.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/dioarrfhiqcpiyyhjtsd", "https://twitter.com/SonTru/status/829579908221325313", "https://t.co/WFxklgHuQA"], "published": "2017-02-09T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:29:04.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
