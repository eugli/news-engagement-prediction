The one thing you can’t do, though, is disrespect the city you’re playing in by getting its name wrong. You can shut your brain off and play the same songs on every night of a tour, but if you don’t take five seconds to learn whether you’re in Milwaukee or Madison, the crowd will turn on you in a heartbeat. \nSadly, that’s exactly what happened to Guns N’ Roses at a recent show in Australia. As reported by the BBC , the band’s guitar technician/announcer (“McBob”) shouted “Sydney” as the band was taking the stage, even though they were actually in Melbourne. The BBC story notes that Guns N’ Roses also got on stage late, so this introduction was “met with a chorus of boos.” \nThe band later apologized on Twitter, explaining that this was McBob’s first mistake in 30 years. Melbourne!Accidentally after 30 years McBob made an error, we’re truly sorry. Thank you for coming out tonight! — Guns N’ Roses (@gunsnroses) February 14, 2017 \nAlso, to make it up to the people of Melbourne, Guns N’ Roses declared that—for that night at least—it was the real “Paradise City”: Thanks for all the love Melbourne 🇦🇺You were Paradise City tonight! — Guns N’ Roses (@gunsnroses) February 14, 2017 \nSubmit your Newswire tips here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:57:58.795+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
