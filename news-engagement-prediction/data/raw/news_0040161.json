No additional details regarding Grimmie's posthumous album were revealed. \nGrimmie's family previously unveiled the singer's four-part Ballad of Jessica Blue in the months following her death. Grimmie's brother Marcus Grimmie talked about the family's emotional decision to release the singer's unheard music on the Elvis Duran Show Thursday. \n\"It's completely and utterly amazing because obviously we were devastated as a family,\" Marcus said. \"For the first three months, we didn't even do anything, and then around August, I would say, we were like, 'Hey, you know, we have so much music that she's been working on.' And close fans, friends and family have asked us about it constantly, and we owe it to her.\" \nMarcus Grimmie estimated that his sister had 50-60 songs with finished vocals at the time of her death. \nProceeds from \"Invisible\" will go towards establishing a foundation named after Grimmie, although the focus of that effort is still under discussion. \"She was super passionate about breast cancer awareness, animal safety, anti-bullying. There are so many things. So, we are just figuring out what's the best way to allocate the funds,\" Marcus Grimmie said. \nIn the Grimmie family's first public statement following the death of the singer, the family wrote, \"Words cannot express what the many memorials, donations and tributes shared by Christina's fans and those in the media and entertainment industry mean to us. She will live on in our hearts forever. We will take our time in determining the best ways to honor Christina moving forward.\" More News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T21:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T17:01:35.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
