Source: AFP \nGiven he is a charming, endearing, humble man in a world full of ego, it is unlikely he will go down swinging. \nInstead, perhaps he has been spared the ignominy of taking the first top flight champions down in eight decades. That responsibility now lies with the players who have abandoned him. \nTHE INCREDIBLE CURSE — FOX SPORTS Football (@FOXFOOTBALL) February 24, 2017 \nFittingly, Jose Mourinho was one of the highest profile names to lend his support to Ranieri; he walked the same road just over a year ago. \nMourinho was pilloried for losing Chelsea’s stale dressing room after clinching the Premier League in 2014-2015, but, as the Foxes players have shown - fresh from pay rises, bonuses and new cars from the club’s owners - these filthy rich millionaires simply can’t conjure the motivation to go again once they reach the Premier League summit. \nIt’s not a recent trend, either. A post shared by Jose Mourinho (@josemourinho) on Feb 23, 2017 at 3:18pm PST \nAntonio Conte, watch your back, or come up with a brilliant idea to keep Chelsea fresh next season. \nIncredibly, the last five Premier League winning bosses have not been able to recapture that success the year after – despite other opportunities, like Champions League or Cup football. \n2012 winner Roberto Mancini was sacked by Manchester City. \nSir Alex Ferguson retired after winning in 2013, bowing out at the highest point before watching Manchester United discombobulate. \nManuel Pellegrini steered Manchester City to the title in 2014, at Chelsea and Liverpool’s expense, but by the end of the next season, knew he was being replaced by Pep Guardiola. \nMost infamously, Mourinho’s Chelsea spectacularly imploded last season, a trait Ranieri’s Foxes have embraced. \nBacking up success in the Premier League is mission impossible. \nTHE PLAYERS GAVE UP THE GHOST \nThe early warning signs were there, too. \nLeicester were beaten in the Community Shield, after returning from a high profile pre-season that looked more like a reward than pre-season preparation, copping eight goals against Paris Saint-Germain and Barcelona. \nKasper Schmeichel, one of the side’s most outspoken critics demanding more of his teammates, is perhaps the only player who can say his pride is intact this season. \nN’Golo Kante’s move was a hammer blow, but he’s replicated his form this season at Chelsea. The other two members of the ‘big three’ - Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez – have been deplorable. Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri Source: AP \nIt hasn’t been all about effort. Execution and quality has disappeared too. \nAccording to stats on the BBC , Vardy is actually covering more kilometres and making more sprints per game this season – but it is all in vain, with the service simply not there. \nFor years, Leicester were a yo-yo club whose fans expected PL campaigns to look just like this – hence, why last year was such a feat. \nBut it is completely unacceptable for the likes of West Morgan, Robert Huth, Marc Albrighton and Danny Drinkwater to revert to type so spectacularly, looking like journeymen they once were, so soon after being so stoic last term. The referee speaks with Leicester's Wilfred Ndidi, left, and Leicester's Wes Morgan. Source: AP \nRanieri has searched helplessly for solutions and his ‘Tinkerman’ moniker from his Chelsea days has returned. Personnel wise, he’s had to juggle European commitments while also losing Islam Slimani and Mahrez to the African Cup of Nations. But he’s also chopped and changed formation in 2017 to spark solutions. Given he used a league low 23 players last season in a rock solid 4-4-2, it’s a stark contrast. The fact he didn’t alter that title winning plan this season until late in December, hints it was probably all done too late, as well. \nIt also hasn’t helped that Ranieri’s re-enforcements - £60m spent on Nampalys Mendy, Ahmed Musa and £30m on Slimani - simply haven’t fired; combine that with last year’s spectacularly executed game plan no longer working, and it has been an unmitigated disaster. \nWHO ARE THE CONTENDERS? \nSpectacularly, Nigel Pearson is the favourite to get the job replacing Ranieri – literally a revolving door, given his sacking paved the way for the Italian’s shock appointment two years ago. Nigel Pearson. Source: AFP \nPearson famously engineered the great escape two seasons ago, before being sacked for boardroom tensions and off-field issues. \nHe would relish this scenario. \nOther names linked are all high calibre unemployed coaches, including Roberto Mancini, Frank De Boer, Roy Hodgson, Mark Warburton, Avram Grant and Guus Hiddink, while PL/Championship career managers like Alan Pardew and Gary Rowett have also been mentioned. Even Harry Redknapp refused to rule out a tilt at the job! \nIS THIS THE PITS? \nMore gallingly for Ranieri, Leicester are a genuine chance to progress to the UEFA Champions League quarter finals, heading home with a 2-1 deficit against Sevilla. Sevilla put Foxes on brink 1:04 \nBut football, as has been said repeatedly today, is a tough business. \nRanieri joins the likes of Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti as sacked Premier League winners (Ancelotti was axed after Chelsea finished second defending their crown in 2011!) to be harshly dealt with. Roberto Di Matteo was axed by Roman Abramovich in 2012 after winning the UEFA Champions League months before, while Harry Redknapp steered Spurs to fourth twice in three years before getting the bullet. \nRanieri is a well-travelled boss. You only have to re-wind to 2004 to when he was axed by Abramovich for finishing second at Chelsea to know he is not a man to be kept down.
