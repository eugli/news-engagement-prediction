One warned people they could even be stopped on the 6 train. \n“Because everybody’s afraid to come, everybody’s afraid to walk on Port Richmond, where there’s been fake news about raids,” he said. \nICE has been targeting criminal, illegal aliens in New York City and around the country , but a spokesperson told CBS2, “reports of ICE checkpoints and sweeps are false, dangerous and irresponsible.” \n“There’s people that are afraid to leave their homes. There’s people that stopped going to work,” said immigration advocate Fahd Ahmed, of Queens. \nAhmed is trying to stop the misinformation. \n“A lot of people are putting up reports about suspected ICE raids online and they just proliferate and spread like wildfire,” he said. \nWith so much confusion and fear on the streets, scam artists posing as ICE officers are targeting immigrants in Woodside, Queens, demanding cash and threatening deportation. \n“First and foremost, no ICE officer, no police officer, no officer, would ever seek money in exchange for not being detained,” said City Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer. \nThe councilman said four suspects dressed like ICE agents conned $250 from a terrified immigrant. \n“We don’t want any immigrants in our community to be so fearful that they have to give their money, as this man did,” Van Bramer said. \n“They have to be more informed about what’s going on around them,” Rodriguez said, hoping his customers will come out of hiding.
