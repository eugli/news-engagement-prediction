Forced to go on the run from a hostile government, the family joins with an underground network of mutants and must fight to survive. \nAlso known as Clarice Fong, Bing is described as sarcastic, lively, and a bit of a tomboy. Her naturally strong exuberance has taken a hit after a sudden and traumatic upheaval of her life. As she adjusts to the new people and places that are suddenly 'home', Clarice is slowly becoming herself again. \nFirst introduced in the X-Men comics in 1994, the character of Blink also boasts the power of teleportation. She was portrayed by Chinese actress Fan Bingbing in 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past. \nMatt Nix ( Burn Notice ) will serve as showrunner and also executive produce alongside franchise veterans Lauren Shuler Donner, Bryan Singer and Simon Kinberg as well as Marvel's Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory. X-Men film franchise veteran Singer will also direct the pilot, which hails from 20th Century Fox TV and Marvel. Chung is the first actor cast in the highly anticipated project.
