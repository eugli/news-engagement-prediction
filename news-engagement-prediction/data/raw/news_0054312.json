when travelling to EU after Brexit \nForeign travellers pay a fee of $14 (£11) to use US automated travel eligibility system ESTA Wednesday 22 February 2017 21:44 GMT Click to followIndy Politics Visitors to the US from a AFP/Getty \nThe EU is considering the adoption of a US-style electronic travel permit scheme – a move which could create a new administrative hurdle for British tourists after Brexit . \nImmigration minister Robert Goodwill told Parliament the EU was discussing the possibility of introducing a version of America's Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA). \nCurrently foreign travellers must pay a fee of $14 (£11) when they complete ESTA , an automated online system which determines their eligibility to travel to the US. Read more This is how the EU will make Brexit as difficult as possible \n“British people are now used to the US ESTA scheme and, therefore, we view with interest how the European scheme might develop and what similarities, and differences, there may be to the US scheme,” said Mr Goodwill. \n“This type of scheme is generally there to help enhance security. To get to know as much as possible about the people who are intending to travel. It isn't just flights, it could be people using ferries, or other border crossings into the European Union.” \nAlan Brown, an SNP member of the European Scrutiny Committee, pointed out that Leave advocates in the referendum campaign had said there would be no need for visa-like travel schemes after Brexit. \n“An ESTA still takes time and costs money and it is something people have to repeat,” he said.

Getty Images 2/26 London to lose status as 'gateway to Europe' for banks \nOne of Germany’s top banking regulators has warned that London could lose its status as “gateway to Europe” for the banking sector after Britain quits the European trading bloc. Andreas Dombret, who is an executive board member for the Bundesbank—Germany’s central bank—told a private meeting of German businesses and banks earlier this week in Frankfurt that even if banking rules were “equivalent” between the UK and the rest of the EU, that was still “miles away from [Britain having] access to the single market”, the BBC reports.
