I was really glad to do it. I was really excited to do it. I’m anxious to just to see how the boy turns out. They say it’s a good success rate and everything like that. So I’m anxious to find out about the boy. But I would do it over and over again,” Veltre said. \nThe recruit also encouraged others to get out and get tested to see if they are a match for anyone in need. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:55:50.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
