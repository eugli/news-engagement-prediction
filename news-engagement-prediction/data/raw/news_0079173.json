But what if a celebrity decided that for this awards season, she would have a higher purpose? Viola Davis was a radiant beam of sunshine as she walked the red carpet at the Golden Globes in a one-shoulder Michael Kors sequined gown . The silhouette was unadorned yet compelling, and the color as bright as her winning grin: She went home with the award for best supporting actress in a motion picture, for her role in “Fences.” (She was also nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award; the ceremony takes place on Jan. 29.) The look defines her red carpet strategy, said Elizabeth Stewart, her longtime stylist. “We wanted to be a symbol of hope in dark times,” Ms. Stewart said. “We wanted to be strong, simple and bold.” As so she was in the sea-foam sequined column with a sporty racer-back cut , also by Michael Kors, that she wore at the Critics’ Choice Awards last month. Once again, the formula was a double winner. Vogue.com hailed the gown as one of the best of the evening, and Ms. Davis nabbed the best supporting actress prize. Though far from a clothes horse, the actress has firm preferences. The white Christian Siriano dress with laser-cut sleeves that she wore to receive her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame this month “really sums up what she likes,” Ms. Stewart said. “She likes fitted, clean and graphic. Also, she zipped right into it; the fitting took five minutes. There’s not a lot of agonizing over choices with Viola.” Given Ms. Davis’s roles on the big and small screens, and her writing and producing projects, Ms. Stewart said that they usually do fittings in Ms. Davis’s trailer on the set of the television series “How to Get Away With Murder,” which stars Ms. Davis. “Almost every major decision has happened in that trailer,” Ms. Stewart said. “We go there on her lunch break, and we fit in 25 looks in five minutes. If people only knew! The look gets parsed so much afterward.” NYT Living Newsletter Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.
