That would affect agencies such as Planned Parenthood, which the state contracts with to provide health care services, but not abortions, for women. \nIt has been illegal to use state taxpayer dollars for abortions since the 1980s and the legislation introduced by Republicans will make sure that no state dollars will go to agencies such as Planned Parenthood even if the dollars are used for health care services other than abortions. \nThe state Department of Health and Human Services acted as a pass-through to get $10 million in federal dollars into Planned Parenthood of Mid and South Michigan to provide family planning and other health services such as cervical screening for women. The contract was a $1.2-million increase from the previous year. \nAnother bill would approve \"Choose Life\" fund-raising license plates as one of the offerings from the Secretary of State. A similar bill was introduced last year, but never got a vote. The state's fund-raising license plate program has shied away from offering politically linked plates. \nAnd a third bill would prohibit an abortion clinic from providing abortions until it got a license through the Michigan DHHS under more stringent rules that were passed by the Legislature in 2012 and defined abortion clinics as free-standing surgical centers. \nOther bills introduced last week include a repeal of the state's controversial fireworks law and a mandate that all schools provide all-day kindergarten classes for students over the age of 5.
