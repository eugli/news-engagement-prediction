Thanaseelan are distraught over his death, claiming they were not even informed of his arrest in the first place.\nHis wife S. Piremilah told The Star Online that the family only knew of his death seven hours after he died at the Bukit Sentosa lock-up and had not even known he was arrested.\n\"We have been separated for over five years now, but he lived nearby and he was close to the children. We saw him often and he was fine and healthy.\n\"He frequently visited my mother's house which is not too far from our house and that's where I last saw him on Feb 21.\n\"It was my daughter's birthday the day before, so I am very sure of the date and I was disappointed that he had not come a day earlier to wish my daughter,\" she said.\nThe police had previously said that Thanaseelan was arrested on Feb 21 and was remanded from Feb 22 to 25.\nDisputing this, Piremilah said her niece had seen Thanaseelan at 10am on Feb 22.\n\"So that means he would have only been arrested after that.\nAsked how she came to know about the arrest, the mother of four said she received a call at 8am on the Feb 25 by an officer known.\n\"I was told that he was serious and that he was in the lock-up. I initially was reluctant to go, but I went eventually only to be told that he was being sent to the Sungai Buloh hospital for gastritis treatment.\n\"Upon arrival there at about 10am, we found out that he had already passed away in the lock-up much earlier at around 1am,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:05:15.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
