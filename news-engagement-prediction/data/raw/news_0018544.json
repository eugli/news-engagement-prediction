While there, she says, she caught a childcare worker breastfeeding her three-month-old son.\nThe angry and disgusted mother recorded a video from the security footage that showed a woman adjusting her top and bringing the baby to her chest to breastfeed him at Carrboro Early School.\nmedia_camera Kaycee Oxendine says video footage shows the worker breastfeeding her three-month-old son. Source: ABC11.\n“THAT’S NASTY. WE DON’T DO THINGS LIKE THAT”\nOxendine explained to ABC11 that her son’s teacher told her the young boy was constipated and offered to breastfeed the boy to see if it would help. Oxendine clearly told the worker no, twice.\n“She said that she had a son and did I want her to put my child to her breast and breastfeed?” Oxendine says.\n“And I said no, that’s nasty. We don’t do things like that.”\nBut Ms Oxendine says the worker ignored her refusal and breastfed the baby as soon as she left the room.\nShe says a video shows the worker picking up her baby and breastfeeding him for several seconds. The woman stopped when another worker who was in the room at the time, left.\n“As a mum, you’ve taken something from me, because I wasn’t able to defend my child,” Oxendine says.\nmedia_camera Kaycee Oxendine is distraught over a childcare worker breastfeeding her baby.

She says her son, who was born prematurely, is lactose intolerant.\n“To me, a criminal act was committed against him,” she said. “Not only did you put your breast to my son, you also made my son sick because he’s lactose. So you’ve put something in his body that his body can’t digest.”\nThe daycare director, Daron Council, told sister station ABC11 that an employee reported what happened and that the worker who did the breastfeeding is no longer there.\nHe said she was licensed, and had been working in childcare for more than a decade.\nKaycee wants her to face criminal charges.\nCouncil said nothing like this had ever happened in one of the facilities. He said as soon as he found out what happened Friday, he reported it to DHHS and informed parents of the children who were under the woman’s care that day.\n“I’m not angry at the childcare centre. I’m very angry at the employee. I do hope that there’s justice for my son.”\nCarrboro police said they were investigating the incident as misdemeanour child abuse. So far, no charges have been filed.\nThis article originally appeared on Kidspot.\n as Daycare worker breastfeeds woman’s son", "external_links": ["http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/parenting/kids/mother-furious-after-childcare-worker-breastfeeds-her-son/news-story/877e97f39c53602cc2ee1b7d9d9b3211", "http://www.kidspot.com.au/parenting/real-life/in-the-news/mother-furious-after-childcare-worker-breastfeeds-her-son", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/622f29cebcc8e5f11e427a79226b9785?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0cf90862057efd174d703fe8c79e22e7?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/877e97f39c53602cc2ee1b7d9d9b3211?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop"], "published": "2017-02-07T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:11:41.314+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
