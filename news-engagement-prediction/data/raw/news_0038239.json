Kenley Jansen says it would have been three times if he had taken the Washington Nationals’ offer. \nJansen, who averaged 42 saves and a 2.32 ERA with the Los Angeles Dodgers over the last three seasons, was the last of the three elite closers on the free agent market to sign. He agreed to a five-year, $80 million deal to return to L.A. on Jan. 10. \nIn mid-December, the New York Yankees signed Aroldis Chapman to a five-year, $86 million contract that shattered the reliever record Mark Melancon had set with his four-year, $62 million contract with the San Francisco Giants 10 days earlier. Giants relieved to turn ninth inning over to Mark Melancon \nMelancon’s departure had left the NL East-champion Nationals without a clear option to close out games, and Jansen said they offered him more than the Dodgers, although he didn’t specify the amount. \n“I probably would have beaten (the record) with Washington, but the best thing for me is to be here,’’ said Jansen, a career-long Dodger. “It’s the best thing for my family. I’m happy to be here, I’m excited to be here. We’re playing for one thing here. We’re playing for winning a championship. It would mean a lot to me to win a championship at home.’’ \nJansen, 29, put on a display of his skill and grit in the decisive Game 5 of the NL Division Series when he threw a career-high 51 pitches in 2 1/3 innings to help preserve the Dodgers’ one-run lead in an eventual 4-3 victory over the Nationals. \nA native of Curacao, Jansen would have been closer to the island had he joined the Nationals, but he lives year-round in the Redondo Beach (Los Angeles County). While the Miami Marlins also pursued the dominant closer, who has averaged 13.9 strikeouts per nine innings over his seven years in the majors, the overture from Washington was the one that really got his attention. \n“That was really serious. They were absolutely aggressive,’’ said Jansen, who is married and has two kids. “It was just a family decision. We wanted to stay here. I wanted to stay here. They gave me a second chance in baseball (converting him from catcher). It feel at home, and I just didn’t want to leave home.’’ \nHe also feels like he has unfinished business to take care of. \nThe Dodgers have won the NL West crown four years in a row but haven’t returned to the World Series since 1988, the last time they claimed a championship. In October they were eliminated in the NL Championship Series for the second time in four years, as the Chicago Cubs bounced them out in six games. \nLos Angeles spent $192 million to bring back Jansen, third baseman Justin Turner and left-hander Rich Hill, and just added former San Francisco Giants reliever Sergio Romo on a $3 million contract that was to become official Wednesday. He’ll set up Jansen. \n“I love seeing him here with us,’’ Jansen said. “It was kind of shocking to see them let him go. It’s exciting to have him here. When they signed him, I called (president of baseball operations) Andrew Friedman and told him how excited I was. He’s a big boost to our bullpen.’’ \nThough not nearly as much as Jansen’s return.
