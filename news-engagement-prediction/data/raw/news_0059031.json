Candice Wiggins (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:49 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:49 p.m. ET \nCandice Wiggins' comments about being bullied as a straight woman in what she said was an almost exclusively gay WNBA are still reverberating. One current WNBA player weighed in Tuesday with a lengthy response. \nMonique Currie of the San Antonio Stars wrote about Wiggins' comments in a post on Currie's personal blog . In it, Currie tried to both chide and support Wiggins, who claimed she was the target of abuse by players. Wiggins retired from the league after playing eight seasons. \nMORE: Openly gay athletes I can say in my eleven seasons in the WNBA I've never witnessed the kind of bullying Wiggins describes in her interview. This does not mean it did not happen but I'm proud to be apart (sic) of a league that supports inclusion and celebrates all players regardless of their race, religion or sexuality. --SNIP-- I feel awful that Candice had these experiences while playing in the WNBA but I encourage her to not only speak out about the negative aspects of her career but also shed light on how we can prevent this from ever happening again. The WNBA gave you a platform to emerge as an advocate for HIV/AIDS in which you have a very personal connection. The WNBA supported you, worked with you, gave you a voice. Why now? Why bring down the league you say you want to be successful? Why not uplift, advocate, and encourage young women to be themselves as you were during your playing days. Let young girls know that it's ok to be \"different\", teach them how to overcome, how to survive and to come out on top. Your voice will be much more appreciated and received that way. \nIn a world where we are already so divided I think it is important for people to tell their stories and to share their experiences. It's equally important for people to listen and to care. I commend Candice Wiggins for telling her story and I look forward to seeing how she uses her experiences to to ensure this never ever happens to anyone again. \nThe \"personal connection\" Currie refers to is the fact Wiggins' father, Alan, a former major league baseball player, died of AIDS complications in 1991.
