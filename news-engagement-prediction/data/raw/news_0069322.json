She said: “I’ve never shared this with anyone, but during that time I was going through a break-up with my ex that I had been with for almost seven years, so the theatre was the most cathartic place for me. On stage: Nicole Scherzinger in the West End production of Cats \n\"It was the only thing that kind of kept me going because I had to keep all that hidden. Every night I just bared my heart and soul on that stage and it was the only thing that really kept me going.” \nShe has since been dating Bulgarian tennis player Grigor Dimitrov, 25, but was tight-lipped about the relationship. “I’m not able to say anything about it,” she said. “I’m very happy where I am.” \nShe was speaking after filming a Müller yoghurt campaign at an athletics stadium in Cape Town. Nicole Scherzinger ‘details Lewis Hamilton heartbreak on leaked song’ \nThe former Pussycat Dolls frontwoman has sold more than 60 million records, but despite her success still feels as if she is an outsider — like her Cats character. \nShe said: “Grizabella had a broken heart and she felt like an outsider, and she was an outsider the way that people treated her, and I identified with her on those levels. I’ve always felt like an outsider my whole life.” \nScherzinger grew up in Kentucky, studied musical theatre at university then joined several bands.

Even when I was in all my groups and stuff I was very alone, I don’t know if that’s just me or what it is, but it’s true.” \nLast summer the star left Lloyd Webber “furious” when she pulled out of the Broadway version of Cats a week before rehearsals began, after she was offered the chance to return as a judge on The X Factor. \nShe said: “I think Andrew was so upset because he’s always been my biggest champion and believer. \n\"But as it worked out, I was really happy to be on The X Factor and Andrew and I and his family, we’ve all made up again and we’re a big happy family and I can’t wait to work with him again.

I think right now it’s a new year so I’m in a very creative space and trying to get back to the artist first that I am, not just the TV personality and judge ... so it’s still up in the air.” Read more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:21:56.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
