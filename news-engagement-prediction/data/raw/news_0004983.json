It took a while, but it finally came. \nIt was a stellar combination between Benny Feilhaber and Jordan Morris in the second half which saw Morris bag the winner on 59 minutes. \nIt was a match that the U.S. dominated when it came to possession, but chances were hard to come by. With Michael Bradley and Jozy Altidore starting the match on the bench, the attack lacked fluidity and precision for most of the game until Feilhaber and Morris took over. \nHere's the winning goal, which was Morris' second for the national team; watch Feilhaber pull off a sick piece of skill to help him out: There it is!ðŸŽ‰ @b_feilhaber22 and @JMoSmooth13 combine for the #USMNT 's first goal of 2017. #USAvJAM https://t.co/EoFOCQuYNp â€” FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 4, 2017 \nJamaica then pushed for an equalizer but the U.S. remained strong in the back to hold on for the win, using two goalkeepers in the match. \nIt's a big win for the U.S. when it comes to momentum and excitement with World Cup Qualifying resuming in March. The U.S. will next play on March 24 against Honduras in San Jose, California in World Cup Qualifying, sitting in last place in the hex after two losses to start off, which saw coach Jurgen Klinsmann fired late last year as a result. \nRelive the match with our live blog below. \nFor news, stories, results and more, follow us:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:48:05.495+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
