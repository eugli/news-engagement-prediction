Remarkably, the man he is tied with, Sydney Barnes, only played 27 matches for England between 1901 and 1914. \nThe former England seamer is followed on the list by Australian leggie Clarrie Grimmett, who took 21 five-fors across his 21 Tests between 1925 and 1936. \nBarnes, Grimmett and Ashwin share the record for the most 10-wicket Tests after 45. All three men have taken seven. 'They'll do their research' \nTHE RACE TO 300 \nAshwin’s next target is to become the 30th player in the 300 wicket club. \nIf he can reach the mark before his 56th Test he will be the fastest to ever take 300 wickets, taking the record from Lillee, who reached the landmark against Pakistan in 1971. \nThe next quickest man to reach the mark was Muralitharan, who took 58 Tests — five fewer matches than Warne, who is the next quickest spinner to 300 wickets. \nMuralitharan holds the record for the quickest bowler to 400 (72 Tests), 500 (87), 600 (101) and 700 (113). \nHe is the only man to have ever taken 800. \nTOPPING THE CHARTS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS \nIt wasn’t that long ago that Ashwin found himself out of India’s Test XI. \nThe tweaker was benched for three of India’s five games in England in 2014 and overlooked for unproven leg-spinner Karn Sharma in the Border-Gavaskar series opener in 2014-15. \nSince then, he has become the game’s most dangerous bowler, topping the wicket-taking charts in 2015 (62 at 17.20) and 2016 (72 at 23.90). \nThanks to those numbers, Ashwin has taken more Test wickets than any bowler in the game since his debut (252 at 25.09) in November 2011. He is closely followed by Sri Lanka’s Rangana Herath (247 at 25.36). Ravichandran Ashwin has taken more wickets in 2015 and 2016. Source: AFP \nTHE CAVEAT \nOf course, as Ashwin’s detractors have pointed out ad nauseam, his numbers have been significantly bolstered by the spin-friendly conditions he enjoys at home, where he has taken 185 of his wickets across 28 matches at 22.14 runs apiece. \nBy comparison, he has only taken 67 at 33.23 overseas. \nThere’s less disparity between his numbers at home (90 wickets at 20.04) and away (48 at 23.25) since the start of 2015, but it should be said that in that time the two series India has played away from home have been in Sri Lanka and the West Indies, where pitches still offer plenty to spinners. \nAshwin’s numbers in Australia (21 wickets at 54.71), England (three wickets at 33.66) and South Africa (108 runs without a wicket) leave much to be desired, though it should be said he has only played two Test in England and one in South Africa. He has played six in Australia. View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
