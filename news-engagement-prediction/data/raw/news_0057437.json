He’s eager to reunite with his childhood friends Joy (Jessica Stroup) and Ward Meachum (Tom Pelphrey), and, it seems, even more eager to live a life away from his mystical duties. \nUnfortunately for Danny, destiny means, well, destiny . “Danny has been told his whole life that there’s a mythological dark force in the world, and he didn’t really believe they were real,” Jones teases as the video cuts to a shot of Madame Gao (Wai Ching Ho) standing on a balcony. A voiceover — possibly Harold Meachum’s (David Wenham), judging by the official trailer ? — then warns Danny “they are very real.” In fact, the voice adds, “they’ve infested Rand,” a.k.a. Danny’s company, now run by the Meachum siblings. \nBut who’s “they”? What’s this “mythological dark force”? And what’s Madame Gao even doing here? Daredevil fans can probably guess the answers to all three: Though the words “the Hand” aren’t mentioned, the nefarious group of ninjas have been key to something brewing in the Marvel-Netflix universe, and Madame Gao had been at the center of an operation that never went away, even after the fall of Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio). Plus, as she once told Fisk himself, she’s from somewhere “a considerable distance further” than China — perhaps somewhere just as unreachable as K’un-Lun? \nEither way, Jones is excited about Danny’s journey. “Who knows who the good guys are going to be?” he says. At least Gao knows who her enemy is. “This city is no place for the Iron Fist,” she declares to someone off-screen. \nWatch the video above for Jones’ thoughts on Danny’s character, a closer look at the tattoo “mark of the Iron Fist” on his chest, and additional footage of the Meachums and Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick).
