I’m talking about freakishly warm air. There’s been a lot of it in areas typically facing bitter cold and deep snow.\nIf you want some numbers to back up the hyperbole, check out the chart. This month there have been a whopping 2,805 record highs across the United States, but only 27 record lows. This pattern of warmth outstripping cold isn’t new, but the ratio in the middle of winter is noteworthy. Chicago had only reached 70 degrees three times in the month of February since 1871. After this week, they could double that.\nAdvertisement\nHere in Southern New England it’s been a snowy month, but not very cold. Cities like Minneapolis and Chicago have been 10 degrees warmer than average this month. In Boston so far, we are just over a degree milder than a typical February, but that gap will grow this week. When February ends, it will mark the 10th straight month of above-average temperatures in the area and the 19th out of the past 20 that have been warmer than normal.\nWeatherBell Analytics\nFebruary has been unseasonably warm over most of the country.\nOn Thursday a southwesterly flow of warm air will propel temperatures into the 60s from Boston to Providence and back to Albany. The question isn’t whether it will feel like spring, it’s just how warm it will become. With enough sunshine and a wind direction that does not transport any cool air off the ocean, Boston could near the record high of 65 set back in 1990.\nDave Epstein\nHighs Thursday afternoon will reach well into the 60s.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. All this warm weather is causing the snow to disappear. The lack of snow is evident all across the upper Midwest and even now here in Southern New England. Folks who would be able to use snowshoes and cross-country skies can’t find any snow at all. The only bright spot for snow fans is in Northern New England, especially Maine, where snow has been abundant this winter.\nNOAA\nSnow is averaging over a foot less than normal in parts of Michigan and Wisconsin.\nAs you might expect, the warmth is causing spring to show up in other ways as well. The cherry blossoms in Washington are on track for their earliest opening ever. The red-winged blackbirds arrived back at my house earlier than usual this week. To the south, buds are breaking ahead of schedule with some trees greening up over two weeks early. If this trend continues and we get a late frost, it could spell big trouble for apple and peach trees. You can be sure farmers throughout New England will be watching temperatures closely in the coming weeks. The early warmth may be enjoyable, but it does have potential consequences down the road.\nNational Phenology Network\nLeaves are appearing weeks ahead of schedule due to all the abnormally warm weather.\nYou can follow Dave Epstein’s forecast on Twitter @growingwisdom", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=It", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Ffebruary-will-mark-straight-month-above-average-temperatures-region%2FzCU5a3lbr8b1eK0G8lC80L%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=It", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Ffebruary-will-mark-straight-month-above-average-temperatures-region%2FzCU5a3lbr8b1eK0G8lC80L%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=It", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Ffebruary-will-mark-straight-month-above-average-temperatures-region%2FzCU5a3lbr8b1eK0G8lC80L%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tIt", "http://twitter.com/growingwisdom", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F22%2Ffebruary-will-mark-straight-month-above-average-temperatures-region%2FzCU5a3lbr8b1eK0G8lC80L%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:52:29.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
