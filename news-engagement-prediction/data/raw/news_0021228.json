NERC Satellite Receiving Station, Dundee University, Scotland \nA gigantic, powerhouse winter storm is charging through the North Atlantic and promises to flood the high Arctic with abnormally mild air. \nThe textbook comma-shape storm is sprawling. The northern part of its core is near the southern tip of Greenland, while its trailing front extends south-westward almost to the tropics. \nREAD MORE: * Can we keep a lid on global warming? \nOn Sunday, the US National Weather Service said it packed winds of over 145km/h (80 knots) near its centre. Computer models suggest the storm has generated towering waves that exceed 14 metres south-east of its core. \nThe storm was most likely near peak intensity early on Monday, with a minimum pressure of 932 millibars - a common reading in category 4 hurricanes and ranking among the top tier of winter storms in this region (the lower the pressure, the stronger the storm). \nThe strongest North Atlantic winter storms on record, from December 1986 and January 1993, had even lower pressure of 900 and 916 millibars. \nA powerful storm in late December 2015, which also sent unusually mild air into the Arctic, had a pressure of 928 millibars. \nThis year's storm is expected to weaken over the next few days but \"is part of an overall pattern that is advecting warm, moist air poleward\", Ryan Maue, a meteorologist with WeatherBell Analytics, said. Ad Feedback \nHe said the storm was teaming with a strong area of high pressure over northern Europe in forcing an onslaught of mild air towards the North Pole through the Barents and Kara seas. \nTemperatures in Svalbard, Norway - an island about midway between continental Norway and the North Pole - are forecast to be 15 to 20 degrees Celsius warmer than normal for much of the upcoming week. \nOn Thursday, areas near the North Pole are predicted to be 10 to 15 degrees warmer than normal (which is about minus-20), which is near the melting point. This may mark the third occasion since November and the fourth time in just over a year that temperatures have warmed to this uncommon winter level near the Pole. \nA recent study in the scientific journal Nature said that, since the late 1950s, warmth of this intensity has occurred only about once or twice a decade. Due to a reduction in sea ice and warming winter temperatures, such warm events are expected to increase in frequency, the study said. \nThe remarkably mild 2016-2017 winter in the Arctic seems to suggest this increase in warm spikes has begun in earnest. - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:22:39.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
