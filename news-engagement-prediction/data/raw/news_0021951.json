But the judges jumped into the larger constitutional questions surrounding Trump's order, which temporarily suspended the nation's refugee program and immigration from seven mostly Muslim countries that have raised terrorism concerns. \nThe hearing Tuesday was conducted by phone - an unusual step - and broadcast live on cable networks, newspaper websites and various social media outlets. It attracted a huge audience, with more than 130,000 alone tuned in to the court's YouTube site to hear audio. \nJudge Richard Clifton, a George W. Bush nominee, asked an attorney representing Washington state and Minnesota what evidence he had that the ban was motivated by religion. The two states are suing to invalidate the ban. \n\"I have trouble understanding why we're supposed to infer religious animus when in fact the vast majority of Muslims would not be affected.\" \nOnly 15 percent of the world's Muslims are affected, the judge said, citing his own calculations. He added that the \"concern for terrorism from those connected to radical Islamic sects is hard to deny.\" \nNoah Purcell, Washington state's solicitor general, cited public statements by Trump calling for a ban on the entry of Muslims to the U.S. He said the states did not have to show every Muslim is harmed, only that the ban was motivated by religious discrimination. \nClifton also went after the government's attorney, asking whether he denied statements by Trump and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who said recently that Trump asked him to create a plan for a Muslim ban. Judge Michelle T. Friedland, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, asked why the case should not move forward to determine what motivated the ban. \n\"We're not saying the case shouldn't proceed, but we are saying that it is extraordinary for a court to enjoin the president's national security decision based on some newspaper articles,\" said August Flentje, who argued the case for the Justice Department. \nThe Economist magazine wrote , “At least two of the judges seemed likely to side with those challenging Mr. Trump’s travel ban, and even the third, Mr. Clifton, might join a ruling against the government.” \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report Advertisement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T13:10:55.765+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
