Le Roux praised the work of investigators that led to the arrests, \"among them three directly suspected of preparing a violent attack against our territory.\" The arrests in Montpellier, Clapiers and Marseillan follow a two-week investigation led by the anti-terrorist division of the Paris Public Prosecutor in collaboration with the judicial police of Montpellier and the national police force, the statement said. French anti-terrorist police on Friday raided this apartment, where suspects believed to be involved in plotting an attack were arrested, in Clapiers, near Montpellier, southern France. The announcement came a week after a soldier shot a man wielding a machete near the Louvre museum in Paris . French authorities opened a terror investigation after police said the man, a 29-year-old Egyptian and a resident of the United Arab Emirates, wielded the knife and shouted \"Allahu akbar,\" an Arabic phrase that translates to \"God is greatest.\" One soldier was injured.
