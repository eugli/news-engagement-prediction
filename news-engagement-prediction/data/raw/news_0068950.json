The vehicles have been handed to Sindh Solid Waste Management Board after being cleared at the port. \nThe trash clearing work will first start in the southern and eastern areas if the city. Work in the southern areas will start from the second week of March. \nThese vehicles can lift up to 10 tonnes of trash. The trash would first be picked up from each and every house and then be taken to garbage transfer stations from where it will be sent to landfill sites. \nSince the vehicles are completely covered, pieces of trash will not fall out, as it is commonly seen happening on the city roads when garbage is carried in vehicles that have been in use. \nNot just vehicles, other equipment has also been sent. These include trash cans. Separate colour trash cans will be placed in different areas. For instance some parts of Gulshan will have blue trash containers. \nThe employees of District Municipal Corporation and sanitary workers will also be involved in the process. \nGiven the growing population in the city, the issue of solid waste management must be dealt with at the earliest and heaps of garbage are the breeding ground of viruses. 0 0 22 of 165 trash cleaning vehicles reach Karachi from China   Areas, Arrive, Cans, China, City, Cleaning, Colours, Containers, Covered, Eastern, Geo News, Geo Pakistan, Latest News, Municipal, Port, Roads, Services, Southern, Trash, Vehicles, Karachi.   \"22 of 165 trash cleaning vehicles reach Karachi from China\" is https://www.geo.tv/latest/132130-22-of-165-trash-cleaning-vehicles-reach-Karachi-from-China  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:53:38.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
