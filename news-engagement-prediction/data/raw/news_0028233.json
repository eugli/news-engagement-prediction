She abandoned me and the children without looking back,” he said \nOlekanma, urged the court to dissolve the marriage, give him custody of their four children and to award him any other consequential orders as the court may deem fit. \nThe respondent (Ibukun) was absent in court, but sent a message that she was no longer interested in the marriage and that the dissolution could go on in her absence. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:09:53.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
