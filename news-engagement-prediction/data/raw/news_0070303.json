The umpire thought he would walk off since it was a clear edge, but he did not. So the finger had to be raised and Wade was on his way. \nAFP \nOf course while it is normal for a batsman to wait for the umpire's decision, in such clear cases does the umpire need to raise his decision at all? \nTwitter was clearly not happy at the decision as fans questioned Wade's integrity.
