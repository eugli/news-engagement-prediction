Small club.\" \nCerezo also believes that Griezmann, who signed a new deal tying him to Atletico Madrid until the summer of 2021 should honour his contract: \"I believe in the contracts that people sign, that goes for Diego Simeone and Antoine Griezmann.\" Atletico president Enrique Cerezo was asked about Griezmann to #MUFC yesterday: \"Manchester United? A small team.\" - Sergi DomÃ­nguez (@FutbolSergi) February 8, 2017 \nAtletico's president then dampened speculation surrounding a Griezmann move by saying: \" Every time I see Antoine I give him a hug. Antoine is a fantastic player and loves life at Atletico.\" \nBut the big question is, will Griezmann push through a move to Manchester United if the right offer emerges? \nTwo days ago, Griezmann's advisor Sebastien Bellencontre hinted that a move to Old Trafford would make sense: \"He would play at David Beckham's former club, which is his idol, with the same legendary number (No.7) on his back.\" \nAway from the Griezmann saga, Atletico president Enrique Cerezo also made some interesting comments on former player Sergio Aguero. \nAguero, who has featured on the subs bench in recent weeks, has been linked with a move away from The Etihad and Cerezo told Marca that the Argentinian was \"stupid\" for leaving: \n\"I said on the radio that Aguero was a fool, but he's not a fool. He is one of the best players in the history of football, and I said he was stupid for leaving Atletico. \n\"He's a great player and a good friend, I wish him all the luck of the world at Manchester City.\" \nAn Aguero return to Atletico? And will Griezmann swap Madrid for Manchester? \nIt's certainly going to be an interesting transfer window in the summer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T15:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T13:14:26.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
