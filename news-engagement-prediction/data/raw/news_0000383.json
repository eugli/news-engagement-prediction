Apparently that made the house affordable, and someone anted up close to $30 mil to seal the deal. \nAll good ... especially for the new owner who gets a sprawling 20,000 square foot oasis that includes 8 bedrooms, 13 baths, a swimming pool, billiards room and card room. \nThere are real winners in this deal ... realtors Mauricio Umansky , David Parnes and James Harris from The Agency repped both buyer and seller, so by our calculation their commission is around $1.5 MILLION!!!
