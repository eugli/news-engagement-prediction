He was 66-years-old. He leaves his adoring and devoted wife, Jocelyn Elise Crowley. He was a great guy, brilliant, hysterical, and moral. He was fiercely loyal, and the only thing he loved more than his work was his life with Jocelyn. He will be missed. The family has asked for privacy during this very difficult time. \nAlan’s colleagues at Fox News, as well as many others, have taken to Twitter to express their condolences. Whoa. Alan Colmes died. We sparred a bunch, but decent guy. RIP. \n— Jonah Goldberg (@JonahNRO) February 23, 2017 So sad to hear of the death of Fox News colleague Alan Colmes. He and I agreed on little, but I liked him immensely. Good guy. R.I.P. \n— Brit Hume (@brithume) February 23, 2017 Heartbroken my friend Alan Colmes has died. He lit up the FNC halls w/his kindness & humor. Incredibly positive force. Prayers 4 his family. \n— Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) February 23, 2017 Alan Colmes was always a gentleman…always kind…a wonderful colleague. pic.twitter.com/VxQimzE3bZ \n— Greta Van Susteren (@greta) February 23, 2017 “I don’t think it’s our business what people do in their personal lives…” – Alan Colmes, R.I.P. https://t.co/NUghugn1wU \n— Adam Baldwin (@AdamBaldwin) February 23, 2017 Just heard of death of Alan Colmes; the kind of liberal I loved-smart, witty, and fair; never backed up, but always backed up his views.
