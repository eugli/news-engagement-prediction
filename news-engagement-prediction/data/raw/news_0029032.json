Brady having just won his fifth Super Bowl, Spieth nabbing the crown at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am by four shots. \nThey each sent one another congratulatory texts – being fellow Under Armour athletes – but only one of them responded to the other. “I still haven’t been able to go through them all and get back to everybody,” Spieth said, via Golf Channel . “One of them that I haven’t gotten back to yet was Tom Brady.” \nHow is it that a 23-year-old can receive a text from arguably the greatest quarterback in NFL history, and not have the time to respond? Well, that’s what happens when you’re one of the best golfers in the world – regardless of age. \nSpieth and Brady have exchanged texts before, though. Spieth texted him after the Super Bowl, congratulating him on the win. “I texted him right after the Super Bowl, obviously saying that was really inspiring what he was able to do,” Spieth said . \nBut why hasn’t Spieth found the time to get back to Brady? For a reason Brady is all too familiar with: He’s focused on the task at hand, which is winning a second straight tournament, this week at Riviera. \nAt least, that was his response when asked if he’s afraid of a celebratory hangover after just winning the Pebble Beach Pro-Am. “I’m very focused on this week and recognize that by Tuesday afternoon no one really cares anymore,” he said. “And that’s fine. It’s on to the next one.” \nSpieth is currently the No. 6 player in the world as he looks to regain his place at the top of the rankings this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T18:01:19.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
