Ten percent said they are undecided on the Jan. 27 announcement.\nThe majority of Democrats, 53 percent, said they \"strongly disagree\" with Trump, while 51 percent of Republicans said they \"strongly agree\" with the policy to block people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.\nThirty-one percent of all respondents said they feel \"more safe\" with the ban in effect, but 26 percent feel \"less safe\" as a result of the executive order.\nSubscribe today to get intelligence and analysis on defense and national security issues in your Inbox each weekday morning from veteran journalists Jamie McIntyre and Jacqueline Klimas.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

Some Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have decried the move as discriminating on the basis of religion since the seven countries are majority-Muslim nations. Trump and top officials said the move targeted countries where they are working to implement \"extreme vetting\" protocols in order to prevent possible terrorists from entering the U.S.\nTrump also said his administration will give preference to Christian refugees, a move that 56 percent of those polled oppose.\nThe poll was conducted in all 50 states with 1,201 respondents, including 453 Democrats and 478 Republicans. The margin of error for the total group was 3 percent and among parties it was 5 percent.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:56:22.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
