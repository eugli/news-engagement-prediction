PUBLISHED: 17:43, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 | UPDATED: 18:21, Wed, Feb 22, 2017 \nSteven Barone has scores of videos on his YouTube channel, UFO s in the USA, that he suggests are alien UFOs or top secret US space vehicles hovering over the Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. \nThe base, like top-secret Area 51 in the Nevada desert, is alleged by conspiracy theorists to be where the US authorities hide the remains of crashed flying saucers and dead aliens, and where secretive technology is developed and tested. \nSome even claim that visiting aliens have been allowed to use the bases to keep them from public view. \nBut, Mr Barone claims to be on to the secret via his YouTube channel. \nHe says he may have filmed space craft developed at the air base on numerous occasions. \nHis latest footage was filmed on February 19 near the base. \nHe wrote about the video: \"If you haven't heard of the USA space fleet I highly suggest you look up Solar Warden or Gary McKinnon. YouTube This is part of a secret space fleet over Nellis USAF base, claims Steven Barone.

He found evidence of a secret space fleet that had been in existence since the 1980s. \n\"It is said that the USA has at least eight tubular motherships and nearly fifty smaller ones. \n\"What really blew him away was a list of non-terrestrial officers and ship to ship transfers. \n\"If you believe this then you have to ask where this secret space fleet is based. \n\"Where better than Area 51 and Nellis Air Force Base. \n\"This is just a theory of mine and I cannot prove it but based on everything I have seen and filmed over a nearly three-year period it is the only thing that makes sense.\" YouTube Steven Barone thinks that there is a secret space fleet over Nellis US Airforce base.
