President Trump holds a rally at the Orlando-Melbourne airport in Melbourne, Fla., on Saturday. (Susan Walsh / Associated Press) Michael A. Memoli returned to campaign mode Saturday with a clear opponent in mind — the media — declaring before thousands of cheering supporters that “fake news” was undermining his nascent administration’s accomplishments. \nThe White House was running “so smoothly,” Trump said in an airport hangar here. He said the rally was about sharing “our incredible progress in making America great again.” \n“I also want to speak to you without the filter of the fake news,” he said. “They’ve become a big part of the problem. They are part of the corrupt system.” \nIn its first four weeks, Trump’s administration has faced setbacks with little precedent, chief among them the resignation of his national security advisor after just three weeks amid a deepening controversy over Russian interference in the U.S. government. \nTrump’s approval ratings are historically low for a new president; one of his Cabinet nominees withdrew despite a new lower threshold for confirmation; and the courts stalled a major early initiative, Trump’s temporary ban on travel to the U.S. from seven majority-Muslim nations. \nTrump painted a far different picture. \n“A great spirit of optimism is sweeping — and you see it — is sweeping across the country,” he said, citing recent stock market highs as his chief evidence. \nThe president has shown frustration with what he considers successes being drowned out by high-profile missteps. That was part of the calculation behind the decision in the West Wing to hold a campaign-style rally so early in Trump’s term. \nTrump has often found comfort in crowds of his passionate supporters, and the 9,000 in Melbourne erupted in cheers throughout his remarks, which lasted about three-quarters of an hour. Their adoration, in the White House’s view, is an important public signal to congressional Republicans who have appeared increasingly wary of Trump’s stumbles. \nWhile President Trump wavered Thursday on whether he will stop shielding from deportation people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, his aides have identified at least two ways to quietly end their protections without his fingerprints. \nAn executive order has already been drafted... \nWhile President Trump wavered Thursday on whether he will stop shielding from deportation people who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children, his aides have identified at least two ways to quietly end their protections without his fingerprints. \nAn executive order has already been drafted... (Brian Bennett and Michael A. Memoli) \nLawmakers are beginning a weeklong recess in which many will head to their districts to confront tough questions from constituents about Trump and the GOP agenda. Many Republicans represent solidly conservative districts where Trump is more popular than he is in the nation as a whole. \nBut gratified as the White House may be from Saturday’s performance, a crucial test looms in just over a week, when Trump will appear for the first time before a joint session of Congress. He’ll give what is typically a speech outlining specific policy priorities. \nTrump campaigned at the same venue in Florida nearly five months ago, on the day after the first of three election debates against Hillary Clinton. \nThen, he touted nonscientific online surveys that credited him for a dominating performance over Clinton, his Democratic rival, when in fact more reliable data showed the public deemed Clinton the clear victor. He described her as “crooked” 20 times. This time, it was the “fake” press. \nHe portrayed his media criticism as, well, presidential. \n\"Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln and many of our greatest presidents fought with the media and called them out oftentimes on their lies,” Trump said. “When the media lies to people, I will never, ever let them get away with it.\" \nSaturday’s rally bore a striking resemblance to the last, with one key difference: the plane. \nInstead of the Boeing 757 private jet bearing his name that was a staple of his campaign, Trump arrived on Air Force One. In September he spoke with his prized jet behind him, but Air Force One was not a backdrop at Saturday’s rally — that would have risked flouting restrictions on mixing political activity with the trappings of the presidency.
