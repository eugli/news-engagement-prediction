Article continues below \nIt seemed like the Balotelli that shone early in his Manchester City career and flourished in spells with Milan was making a comeback, but old habits have come back to bite the forward hard. \nHe has also found himself on the Nice bench recently, mostly because of his stuttering performances.

I've made a commitment and I'll speak with Balotelli,\" Ventura said at a media conference. \n\"We haven't been able to meet yet, we've made a lot of calls, not me but [team manager Gabriele] Oriali. We'll meet, but no-one can argue with Balotelli in terms of his ability, it's all the other stuff. \n\"So far there haven't been positive signs. The facts tell you that Balotelli must change, we hope he does because it would be a shame if he threw his talent away.\" \nNews that Balotelli has to change is nothing new. Since the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, he had only managed to score to score two league goals in 36 appearances before his move to Nice, and when you consider he has three red cards this season, the ratios are not favourable. \nIt seems as though the 33-time Italy international is really running out of chances around the continent now, but after showing he can score goals this season, there will always likely be somebody who is willing to take a chance on him. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
