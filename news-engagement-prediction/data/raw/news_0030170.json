Photo: Mark Zammit Cordina \nFormer PBS presenter Lou Bondì is being paid €22 an hour as a consultant to the government’s arts council, according to his contract. \nHe has also been assigned to act as artistic director of the council’s annual rock festival. \nAfter the Data Protection Commissioner overruled a decision by the Justice Ministry not to publish Mr Bondì’s contract, this newspaper was given access to the employment conditions of the former chairman of the Nationalist Party’s Radio 101. \nAccording to the latest contract, Mr Bondì’s fourth since Labour’s return to power in 2013, he is giving “strategic communications advice” to the Malta Arts Council. \nThe contract stipulates that he receives €22 an hour for a 40-hour week and is entitled to an additional retainer of €8,240, excluding VAT, to cover expenses. \nHis total package amounts to €54,000 a year. He is also entitled to a €8,240 retainer, excluding VAT, to cover expenses \nEngaged on a self-employed basis, Mr Bondì is not required to report for work at the arts council but is paid instead against the issuance of invoices which list the number of hours he worked for the government. \nHe is also free to offer his services to other organisations, including in the private sector. \nMr Bondì’s engagement was made through a direct order issued by Justice Minister Owen Bonnici, who is politically responsible for the arts council. \nThe contract specifies that Mr Bondì will not receive extra remuneration for his role as artistic director of an annual rock festival, although he will be compensated for any expenses paid. \nUntil the last general election.
