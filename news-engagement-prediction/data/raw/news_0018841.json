(Kim Robertson: ABC News) \nAdelaide is in the middle of a heatwave with today's expected top 39 degrees Celsius and Saturday 36C. \nMr van Weenen has warned people not to touch the bats because they could carry deadly diseases such as Hendra virus and Australian bat lyssavirus. \n\"It's really important that people don't pick them up,\" he said. \nNatural Resources SA said the flying foxes were a threatened species and anyone who came one needing assistance should contact Fauna Rescue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:07:25.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
