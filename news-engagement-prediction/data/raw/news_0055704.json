But systematic racism is still alive,” one witness for the Black Lives Matter side will declare.\nThe organization also provides a separate room where people can talk out their feelings after walking through the tunnel. The tunnel can be “exhausting” for everyone involved, one student added.\nA group of students at the University of Wisconsin-Madison demanded free tuition for black students in the name of justice. The Associated Students of Madison called for reparations in the form of free money.
