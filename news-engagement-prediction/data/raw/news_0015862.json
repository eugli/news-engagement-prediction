(Marin Independent Journal/CBS) \nSAN RAFAEL (CBS SF) — Two young drifters accused in a pair of killings in Marin County and San Francisco in October 2015 have pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. \nMorrison Lampley, 24, and Lila Alligood, 19, pled guilty Monday to the murder of 67-year-old Steve Carter, shot and killed while hiking with his dog on a Fairfax trail on October 5th, 2015. Carter’s dog was also shot but survived. \nThe two also pled guilty to the murder of 23-year-old Canadian tourist Audrey Carey, shot dead two days earlier while camping in Golden Gate Park. (L-R) Audrey Carey, Steve Carter \nLampley, Alligood and a third defendant, 25-year-old Sean Angold, had been charged with special circumstances of lying in wait, committing multiple murders and murder during the commission of a robbery. (L-R) Lila Alligood, Sean Angold and Morrison Lampley (Multnomah County, Oregon Sheriff) \nThe Marin County District Attorney’s Office said Morrison admitted to pulling the trigger in both murders and will receive a state prison sentence of 100 years to life. \nAlligood will be sentenced to state prison for 50 years to life, according to the district attorney’s office. \nAngold had testified against his two other co-defendants as part of a plea deal. He pled guilty to one count of second-degree murder and will receive a 15 years to life prison sentence, the DA’s office said. All three waived their rights to appeal their convictions. \nAt the preliminary hearing, Angold testified Lampley shot Carter and Carey. Attorneys for Alligood and Lampley argued Angold lied to avoid life in prison. \nAngold testified he stole the gun used in the murders from an unlocked vehicle in San Francisco and helped plan the robberies of Carey’s backpack and Carter’s vehicle and wallet. \nAngold testified he walked away from where Carey was robbed in bushes in Golden Gate Park and heard gunshots. He testified Lampley told him, “She’s dead dude, don’t worry about it.” \nAngold also testified he was farther down the trail in the park when Lampley killed Carter. Defense attorneys Amy Morton and David Brown said the big question at the preliminary hearing was who had possession of the murder weapon because Angold testified he and Lampley shared its possession. \nAngold testified the three drifters were using drugs he bought, including LSD, heroin and methamphetamaine during the week they traveled together in the Bay Area and to Portland, Oregon. They were arrested in Portland on Oct. 7, 2015. \nAt the preliminary hearing Deputy District Attorney Leon Kousharian argued the three planned to get money to grow marijuana in Oregon. \nLampley was in charge and Alligood participated more actively in the crimes after Carey was killed, Kousharian said. \nLampley and Alligood were held over for trial for robbery, and two murders with special circumstances of murder during a robbery, lying in wait and committing more than more murder. \nMarin County District Attorney Edward Berberian said the disposition of Lampley’s and Alligood’s cases was reached with extensive discussions with the families of the victims who will be given an opportunity at the sentencing to address the court and describe the full impact of their losses. \nSentencing was set for April 18. \n  2016 CBS   rewritten, or redistributed.
