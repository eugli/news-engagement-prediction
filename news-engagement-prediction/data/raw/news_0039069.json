Bayern Munich 5-1 Arsenal player ratings: Ozil & Iwobi go missing as Gunners crumble again \nTrump’s latest moment of bemusement has occurred after former WWE CEO Linda McMahon was confirmed by the Senate to run the federal Small Business Administration. \nLinda donated millions of dollars to Trump during his Presidential campaign, and her generosity has been rewarded with a place in his cabinet. Congratulations to our new Administrator of the Small Business Administration, Linda McMahon!

Two Wrestlemania events were hosted at his venues, while he unofficially took over Raw in 2009, causing stock to fall. \nAfter being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013, many thought that Trump had said goodbye to the world of over-the-top theatrical pageantry, but his successful foray into politics has perhaps proved that a cartoon world is the only one he truly knows. \nWhat other President would celebrate professional wrestling during his time in office?
