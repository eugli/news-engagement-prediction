The current H-1B minimum wage of USD 60,000 was fixed in 1989 and has since remained unchanged. \nSuch protectionist stance by the US could also spell more trouble for IT firms that are already facing strong headwinds from currency fluctuation and cautious client spending. \nThe Ministry of External Affairs has said India's interest and concerns on the issue have been conveyed both to the US administration and the US Congress at senior levels. \nExplaining about the visa issue, Sitharaman said that there are several nuances to the law proposed by the US. \n\"It is a call which is possibly going to happen through an executive order which will mean a few things...Probably, we will have to wait for Congress approval. There are several things which are embedded in that...And since it is so layered it is not right for me to react at one go,\" she added. \nFurther commenting about the increasing global protectionism, the commerce minister said that it is increasing during the time when global demand is also not picking up. \nHowever, Indian exporters are maintaining growth in exports. \n\"We are watching global developments and keep supporting our exporters,\" she said. \nShe also said that the interest subsidy scheme for exporters has great impact on exporters. \nThe ministry has utislised the funds of the scheme nearly 100 per cent, Sitharaman said, adding now exports are recording positive growth. \n\"I think that scheme will continue. We will make sure that there will be good support from the Finance Ministry...During bilateral talks, we are also looking at greater market access of our goods and services,\" she said. \nThe ministry is also ensuring that poor quality and sub standards imports are avoided, she said. \nWhen asked about issues to be discussed during the visit of WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo to India this month, the minister said India would discuss the ways to implement the agenda of the Nairobi Ministerial meeting. \n\"Everything that has been agreed to in Nairobi ministerial should be implemented. We really can not be going over the next ministerial without fulfilling what we have committed ourselves to in Nairobi,\" she said. \nThese issues would be raised by India with the WTO chief, she said, adding it should be ensured that that the processes are completed before \"we reach Argentina\". \n\"Last time the processes were not completed. They were rushed through as a result even the WTO DG has to admit in Davos that the process was incomplete and not really perfect in Nairobi. We do not want that error,\" she said. \nIndia, she said, would reiterate on completion of Doha Round and bringing on new issues only after consensus .
