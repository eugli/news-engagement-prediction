Akhilesh also accused PM Modi of distorting crime data of the state.\"The Prime Minister is saying there is a BJP storm and the chief minister fears that he might be blown off. But we Samajwadis know how to ride a cycle against wind,\" he said.His barb came at a series of election meetings in Sitapur and adjoining Lakhimpur Kheri a day after PM Modi said in Aligarh that, \"...when the wind is so strong, even a young leader cannot face it and seeks help of anything ...even a pole...but this time BJP 'aandhi' (storm) is so strong that the chief minister fears that he might be blown off...\"He said, \"If he (Modi) feels storm in UP, he might have felt some strong winds in Punjab also.\"Akhilesh charged PM Modi with misrepresenting facts and figures about UP.Reacting to PM Modi's remark on poor law and order situation in the state, Akhilesh said, \"God knows from where the PM obtained figures (about UP)...the Prime Minister should have honestly put up correct figures before the people.\"Continuing his diatribe, the chief minister said, \"If there be the worst states in country in terms of law and order - on number 1, number 2 and number 3, these are the BJP-ruled states.\"Akhilesh listed the achievements of his government and said that more development will take place if the SP returned to power.Attacking the BJP, he said, \"This party made people stand in queues outside banks...Many poor people lost their lives but the BJP did not come to their rescue. It was the SP government that announced a financial aid of Rs 2 lakh for the families of such people.\"No one got Rs 15 lakh after all the money was deposited into bank accounts (during the demonetisation drive). Now, they are not telling us how much black money... how much ill-gotten money is there.\"On the SP-Congress poll alliance, the chief minister said, \"It has accelerated the pace of SP's cycle...We did not act like a miser friend. We gave a good number of seats to Congress.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:18:08.155+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
