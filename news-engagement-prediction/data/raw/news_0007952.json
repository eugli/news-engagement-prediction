The state’s housing allowance for single people on public assistance is $215 a month, not enough for much of anything in a city where the median monthly rent is more than $1,300. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “The state is not doing anything to curb the abuses and next to nothing to create permanent housing solutions,” said Paulette Soltani, an organizer with the nonprofit groups Vocal-NY and the Three-Quarter House Tenant Organizing Project. As part of its investigation, The Times profiled one operator of three-quarter houses, Yury Baumblit, whose Back on Track program showed that profiteers can turn the poorest of the poor into cash machines of government money. Mr. Bates was one of his tenants. Photo Tyrone Flowers packing up during an eviction from one of Mr. Baumblit’s houses in March 2015. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times Like other three-quarter operators, Mr. Baumblit charged his tenants only $215 a month — their housing allowance — unless they received federal disability payments, in which case they had to pay more in cash. The homes were crammed with bunk beds. In a room the size of a parking space, four men slept. Even if tenants said they were not addicted to drugs, they had to go to outpatient substance-abuse programs picked by Mr. Baumblit. Even if they had another doctor, they had to go to his clinic of choice. The medical providers then paid Medicaid kickbacks to Mr. Baumblit’s program, residents and employees said. Those addicted to drugs faced a worse fate. Longtime tenants who had nowhere else to go told The Times that once they finished one program, they were told to relapse, so they could test positive and enroll in another picked by Mr. Baumblit. Mentally ill and disabled people often found themselves signing over their benefits to Mr. Baumblit’s employees. One said he was given only $5 a day. Drug use flourished in the homes. People died of overdoses. Bedbugs and mice spread; mold bloomed in bathrooms. Last year, Mr. Baumblit, 66, and his wife, Rimma, 60, were charged with Medicaid fraud and money laundering in two different cases by the New York State attorney general’s Medicaid fraud control unit. Anthony Cornachio, 74, who ran the two outpatient programs detailed by The Times, was also charged with Medicaid fraud and money laundering. They each face up to 25 years in prison. After the initial article, the city formed an emergency task force to inspect the homes and move tenants out of dangerous dwellings. But dozens, if not hundreds, of homes still operate, unregulated, throughout the city, housing advocates say. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Bates, who said he did not smoke, drink alcohol or use drugs, said that in hopes of getting permanent housing, he drank some Fireball whisky just before going to the outpatient program so he would test positive. After more than seven months, Mr. Baumblit gave him nothing. But he was one of the lucky tenants. Now he is working at a restaurant, and volunteering as a leader at the Three-Quarter House Tenant Organizing Project. The task force moved him into a Sleep Inn in Brooklyn. He says the city is now helping him find permanent housing. And on Wednesday, Mr. Bates celebrated his 34th birthday with what he called “an excellent present” of the City Council votes. “I’m just glad to be out, and that other people might not have to go through what I did,” he said. \nNate Schweber contributed reporting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:52:01.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
