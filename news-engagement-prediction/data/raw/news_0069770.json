Our models are just not that good.”\nChief economist of Bank of England admits errors in Brexit forecasting Read more \nThe Bank should continue trying to improve and refine its forecasting models, he said, but it was misguided for MPs to demand that economic forecasts offer a high degree of certainty about events that could happen several years from now.\nVlieghe, a former City economist, was answering criticisms from MPs on the Treasury select committee over a series of forecasting errors in the run-up to the Brexit vote .\nLike the Treasury, the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Threadneedle Street predicted a sharp slowdown in the event of a vote to leave the EU.\nOfficial figures have shown that, far from slowing, the UK became one of the best-performing economies in the developed world and the fastest growing in the G7 in the second half of 2016.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Bank of England was told by MPs it should be more circumspect about forecasts, rather than presenting them as ‘holy writ’. Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian \nGovernor Mark Carney said actions by the Bank itself, which cut interest rates weeks after the Brexit vote, and Chancellor Philip Hammond, who lifted constraints on public spending in November’s autumn statement, had helped to boost the economy in the wake of the Brexit vote.\n\nCarney admitted the MPC had misjudged the resilience of consumer spending following a wobble after the referendum, but it could not include in its forecasts actions that policymakers might take to offset weaker confidence among consumers and businesses.\nMP Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested the Bank should be more circumspect about its forecasts, rather than presenting them as “holy writ”, and then revising them six months later .\nAndy Haldane, the Bank of England’s chief economist, said fan charts showed the probability of the future path of growth and inflation and in most cases the predictions were within a narrow range of the central forecast.\nHowever, he conceded that the economics industry and the Bank found it difficult to convey a sense of uncertainty to the wider world. He said: “We know that people find risk hard to understand; I find risk hard to understand.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:12:05.904+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
