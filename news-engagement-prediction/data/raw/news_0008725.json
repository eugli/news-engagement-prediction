The trip made news because we saw her snaps with husband, Saurabh Devendra Singh. The two have been in a relationship since a long time and tied the knot in a private ceremony last year. This was the first time Saumya made an acknowledgement about her marriage on any social platform. While she had a gala time, it seems the actress suffered an injury due to language issues. \nWell, Saumya and her husband were taking skiing courses in Switzerland. It was a beginner’s course and she was having a lot of fun. But things got awry because of a mix-up in instructions. In a statement to The Times of India, she said, “My instructor spoke very little English while I understood little German. We managed fine during the initial classes as he demonstrated the basic steps. In fact, I had made good progress and both were happy. However, it was in the baby slope that the instructions were lost in translation. I was doing my first solo run and I heard my instructor shout ‘fast’. So, I skied faster, but turns out, he meant the German ‘fast’, which means ‘nearly done’. He was trying to boost my confidence, but I was already skiing at a fast pace and couldn’t control the speed. While trying to stop the slide, I fell with my knees collapsing inwards. I suffered a grade one tear and had a swollen knee.” Ouch!
