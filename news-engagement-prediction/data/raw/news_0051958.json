A 63-year-old woman in Dubai has given birth to a healthy baby girl at Thumbay Hospital on February 19, 2017 at 7.15 am, making her a third-time-mum after a year-long IVF treatment.Last year, the Sri Lankan woman and her Indian husband decided to start a family, but they knew they'd have to deal with a few bumps in the road. To overcome the risks associated with late pregnancies, they saw an in vitro fertilization specialist in Chennai (India) who gave her the go-ahead.The journey, however, was not an easy one, admits the 63-year-old miracle mum. She was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia (hypertension during pregnancy) and placenta previa (the condition when a baby's placenta partially or totally covers the opening in the mother's cervix), following her check-ups at the Thumbay Hospital. By the 36th week, she complained of bleeding, and was therefore led to an emergency caesarean section.Overwhelmed with the joy of welcoming her baby four weeks in advance, the new-mom said, \"Despite the complications in the case, the hospital staff extended special care and provided round-the clock services to make it a smooth delivery and post-natal care. The baby weighed 2.3-kilogram (5.1-pound) at birth and is now doing perfectly well.\"Dr. Jaget Nirmala, Specialist, Obstetrics & Gynecology at Thumbay Hospitals said, \"Women who are healthy enough to have a baby in their later years shouldn't be scared to do so. One should let nature decide. Childbearing at 63-years of age is extremely rare, but not a record. The patient and the baby have responded well to the treatment at our facility and have been doing well.\"The hospital authorities confirmed that the couple will be able to take their newborn home on February 21, 2017.
