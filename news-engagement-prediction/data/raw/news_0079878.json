Wow. Way to go Douglas County. For this to be considered a \"hate crime\" I think the sentencing was fair. https://t.co/uBWMVjB1Ey — Mrs. Hargrett (@TheeMrsHargrett) February 27, 2017 \nTorres received 20 years, with 13 to serve in prison, while Norton got 15 years, with six to serve. In addition, upon their release, the judge ordered them to be permanently banished from Douglas County. They were convicted of violating Georgia's street-gang terrorism law earlier in February. \nThe pair wept openly in court. \nTorres and Norton were members of Respect the Flag, a group that had been demonstrating in defense of the Confederate battle flag. In a drunken, two-county rampage in pick-up trucks laden with Confederate battle flags, the group drove through Paulding and Douglas counties over July 24 and July 25, 2015, according to the AJC. \nDuring the frenzy, the Georgia group threatened African-American motorists, yelled at them and walked up to one of their cars with a gun. They also threatened African-American shoppers at a Paulding County Walmart and at a convenience store. \nThe final stage of the episode was captured on two cellphone videos filmed by party goers when the group parked opposite an African-American 8-year-old's party. Clips show a Douglasville police officer holding off a group of agitated black men and women as at least seven trucks brandishing various flags drive by. \n“Many good people in Paulding County saw you for what you are,” Judge McClain said before he handed down the sentence. “Everywhere you went 911 call centers were flooded with calls.” \nMcClain quoted one of the callers in court: \"'I want to report a hate crime.’” \nSeveral other group members were also indicted by a grand jury for their actions that day, including Thomas Charles Summers and Lacey Paul Henderson II, who pleaded guilty to terror threats and battery charges. Summers was sentenced to four years in prison and Henderson to two, according to Patch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:35:12.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
