Her sister Meera dropped out when she was 15. \nDhivya’s best friend Puvanes was also contemplating quitting school just like her brother, Chandran, did. \nChandran quit three years ago when he turned 17, and today he works as a bouncer at a club in Bukit Bintang. According to Puvanes, Chandran makes a lot more money than their father, who is a Kuala Lumpur City Hall labourer. \n“My mother sometimes goes out to work as early as 6am. I am needed at home to take care of my baby sister and little brothers,” said Puvanes. \n“I no longer like going to school; teachers are always rude to me and my friends from the longhouse,” she said. \n“My mother is okay with me working, it is fun at times, we get to go out and buy things and we also feel important,” Dhivya said. \nThen there is 18-year-old Siti who dropped out after Form Two, to help her mother sell nasi lemak . \n“Most of my friends quit about the same time to go to work or to get married,” said Siti. \n“My older sister, Rose quit school to get married at age 15. By 16 she was already mother to a baby girl,” she added. \nApart from sharing a mutual dislike for school, all the girls share a common address. They were all born and bred in the biggest slum in the city, a mere 11km away from the Kuala Lumpur’s iconic landmarks. \nThe girls are a growing number of children who have to quit school as they are forced to take on adult responsibilities due to poverty. \nTheir parents are the pioneer residents of the Jinjang Utara longhouse in Kepong. They were relocated about 25 years ago from various squatter areas the city; more than 6,000 residents were brought here by Kuala Lumpur City Hall (DBKL) to live in 400sq ft units made from asbestos and zinc sheets. \nTheir transit home was meant to be a temporary solution to their housing woes, but turned out to be nightmare that has spanned over two decades with the casualty being its young children, mostly girls. \nBut parents seem unfazed by the situation. \nVicious cycle \n“You cannot blame the parents for being indifferent (about their children),” said Arumugam Marimuthu. \n“They were not that much older than their own children when they first started living here,” he pointed out. \nThe 54-year-old resident was 29 years old himself when he was among the Segambut squatters relocated to Jinjang Utara longhouse. \n“I had just gotten married, and my wife and I were looking forward to starting a family of our own. We were informed by City Hall that our stay would only be for two years. \n“At that time it was exciting as we came from a slum where we had to draw water out of a well to bathe and cook. So this place (Jinjang Utara longhouse) was almost like heaven on earth in comparison,” he added. \nThe following year, Arumugam became a father to a baby girl. \n“Kumuthini, my eldest girl was born in 1993, a year after we moved in. Today, she is 25 years old, married, and dislikes everything about this place. \n“I do not blame her for feeling that way,” he said, adding that marriage was Kumuthini’s way out. \nBut for others, their escape is through other avenues such as truancy, joining gangs, taking drugs and alcohol, and indulging in unprotected sex. Teenage pregnancy is a norm here,” said Arumugam. \nFor girls like Puvanes, Siti and Dhivya, their tales are symptomatic of their life in the slums and representative of how teenagers easily get involved in unhealthy activities. \n“I saw this all when I was growing up in the Segambut squatter area before moving here,” said Arumugam. \n“But I reached a turning point in my life when Kumuthini was born, I knew I did not want my daughter to have that kind of life,” he added. \nArumugam is president of the Selangor and Federal Territories Community Association (Permas), an urban poor movement that helps poverty-stricken residents of Klang Valley resolve their land and housing issues. He was elected to the post, a few months ago, after having served as committee member and vice-president for years. \nUnlike Arumugam, Jennifer Anthony was only 16 when she came to live in the Jinjang Utara longhouse with her parents and brothers. She was from the Sentul Pasar squatter settlement. \nBy 17, she had given birth to her eldest daughter Lavanya. Today, at age 36, she has five other children ranging between 19 years and 10 months. \nThree of her teenage daughters, including Lavanya have quit school and are currently helping Jennifer with babysitting duties at home. \nWhen asked why her children were no longer attending school, Jennifer simply shrugged her shoulders and said they were not interested. \nNeglected lot \nToday, about 1,000 families with an estimated population of 2,000 to 2,500 still live in Jinjang Utara. \nAccording to Permas records, about 30% of the population are youths and children below 20 years old. \n“What is more worrying is that at least 200 children have dropped out of school in the past year or so, and the number may increase the longer they continue to live in these cramped conditions,” said \n“More than 3,000 children are living in slums across Kuala Lumpur,” \n“ \n“At this point in time, it is crucial for the Government to expedite their move into affordable housing in the city,” \n“Between 1992 and 1998, there was a reduction of 32.4% in squatter population. Many were relocated into People’s Housing Schemes, but there were also thousands who were moved into transit homes in Segambut, Kepong, Setapak and Cheras. And they are still there today, 25 years later, it is unacceptable,” \nFauziah Kundor, 67, who lives in a unit packed with 11 extended family members, said: “I am happy, we have lived in cramped conditions for so long. I am okay with that, to be honest, as I have simply gotten accustomed to it. My children too had to put up with it, but I do not want this life for my grandchildren. \nFauziah’s 33-year-old daughter, Yusniza Mohd Yusof agreed: “I have three sons, aged between five and nine years old. They are too young to know anything yet, but for their sake, I want to get out of here as soon as I can. I do not want my sons to experience the life I endured while growing up. \n“I lost a son who overdosed on drugs here. I wonder if he would still be around if we had gotten out of this place sooner,” \n“I hope my grandchildren will not have to live here,” \n“As a student, the bulk of my work requires me to go online and I spend most of time doing my course work in a cybercafe or at college, so this is really good news to me and other students like me,” \nKepong Community Service Centre head Yee Poh Ping, who has been championing the cause of getting permanent homes for these residents in the past decades, said: “When they moved here in 1992, residents had to fight for basic facilities such as public bus service, consistent water supply and proper waste collection. It is unacceptable that these poor folk are still grappling with the same problems today. \nIn the early 1980s, longhouse residents were promised h \n“ \n“ \n“ \n“The residents must be able to move into their new units with both electricity and water supplies in a month or two,”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:06:33.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
