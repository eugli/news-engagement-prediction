Chris Perkins , sidelined late last season with two sprained ligaments in his left knee, will be ready for the start of the team’s offseason program in April without having surgery on the knee, according to a source.\nTannehill sprained the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in the knee against Arizona on Dec. 11. He missed the final three regular season games and the 30-12 wildcard loss at Pittsburgh. \nBut he is now poised to take part in the Dolphins’ offseason activities. \nThe team first thought Tannehill had a serious knee injury, but it was quickly revealed he’d only sustained sprained ligaments, not complete tears to either ligament. \nThe Dolphins kept Tannehill on the active roster, prompting thoughts he could return before the end of the season. Tannehill was nonetheless a fixture at practice, walking around with a brace on his knee. He was even seen once in the locker room without the brace and walking without a limp. \nAt one point Tannehill even went through some light drills a few weeks after the injury. But it was decided he wasn’t healthy enough to play. \nTannehill had 19 touchdowns, 12 interceptions and a career-best 93.5 passer rating last season under first-year coach Adam Gase. \nTannehill seemed to grow in a number of areas last season, most notably decision-making and accuracy, in what some considered a make or break year in his future with the team.
