They were turned over to the Philippine National Police’s Criminal Investigation and Detection Group. ADVERTISEMENT \nArbitrario was arrested in Tagum City in Davao del Norte province in February last year, but the city’s Regional Trial Court Branch 3 approved his release on bail, along with another NDFP consultant, Eduardo Genelsa, on Aug. 17 last year. \nThe President on Friday lifted the government’s six-month-old ceasefire with the rebels and on Saturday, he scrapped the talks. \nHe demanded that rebel leaders, who were temporarily freed to join the negotiations as consultants, go back to jail, threatening to have them arrested if they refused. \nThe President’s moves came after the guerrillas abandoned their own truce and killed six soldiers and kidnapped two others in fresh violence. \nThe government and the rebels separately declared a ceasefire last year to encourage peace talks, which had steadily progressed in recent months before rapidly deteriorating in recent weeks. \nThe NDFP accused the military of violating the government’s own ceasefire by deploying troops to about 500 villages across the country and continuing counterinsurgency operations like surveillance that it said inevitably led to new fighting. \nBefore Arbitrario’s arrest, the CPP had expressed concern over Mr. Duterte’s threat against NDFP peace consultants. \nLuis Jalandoni, an adviser to the NDFP negotiating panel, said the 17 freed rebels were protected by a 1995 accord under which the government agreed to grant them immunity from arrest while serving as peace talks consultants. \nAll the rebels have returned to the Philippines after joining a recent round of talks in Rome and should not be arrested, he said. ‘Spoiled brats’ \nTold that Jalandoni was insisting that NDFP consultants were protected by the Joint Agreement on Safety and Immunity Guarantees (Jasig), the President said: “I am not his client. I don’t take any orders from anybody.” \n“I tried my best to make peace with everybody. These communists, they are spoiled brats. It’s as if they are in the government when they make demands,” he added. \nMr. Duterte, who called the CPP a “terrorist” organization, then conceded that he could not fulfill his campaign promise to end the communist rebellion during his six-year term. \nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines said it had yet to receive a copy of the President’s official order for the arrest of NDFP consultants. \nCol. Edgard Arevalo, chief of the AFP public affairs office, said the arrest of Arbitrario and Mamuyac on Monday had nothing to do with the President’s order. \nMamuyac has a standing warrant of arrest on murder charges issued by Judge Virginia Tehano of a Davao court, according to Arevalo. \nBayan Muna Rep. Carlos Isagani Zarate said the government should not just arrest NDFP consultants, as there were processes on bail and Jasig that had to be followed first. \nBut Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II said the bail granted to the NDFP consultants was not “indefinite” because it was good for only six months to one year. \n“Unless they get a renewal for their bail, they will be considered wanted persons,” Aguirre said. Formalize suspension \nThe justice secretary said the arrests would be made only after Mr. Duterte had formalized the suspension of peace talks. “Once it has been established that there is no more peace talks and they are back here, they will be arrested,” he said. \nAguirre said the government would ask the court if the NDFP consultants had violated the terms of their bail, which would mean they could be arrested without making any motion to lift their bail. \nMr. Duterte’s sudden termination of the talks will take effect only one month after serving a written notice to terminate the process, as previously agreed upon by both sides, according to Jalandoni. \nThis meant that NDFP holders of safe conduct under Jasig could not be arrested and detained anew during this period, he said. Spur of the moment \nThe CPP said Mr. Duterte’s statement scrapping the talks might be a spur of the moment decision without considering the many gains achieved after the resumption of the negotiations. \n“His decision was made clearly without judicious consideration of the advice of his peace panel, and coming at the heels of a successful third round of peace talks in Rome, Italy, just over a week ago,” the CPP said. \nEven with the gloomy situation, the CPP said it was hopeful that both negotiating panels would meet again this month. \nBoth parties agreed during the third round of talks in Rome last month that they would meet again in The Netherlands on Feb. 22-24 to discuss the crafting of a bilateral ceasefire agreement and on April 2-6 for the fourth round of talks. \nExpected in the fourth round of talks are agreements on major points that will clear the way to the signing of the Comprehensive Agreement on Social and Economic Reforms. \n“We’re saying the peace talks are still possible in the absence of a ceasefire,” Jalandoni told radio dzMM by telephone from Europe. Humps, curves, detours \nDespite his tough stance, the President on Saturday said that he may reconsider his decision if there was a compelling reason. \nHis adviser on the peace talks, Jesus Dureza, suggested on Sunday that the President’s decision may still change. \n“As I always say, the road to just and lasting peace is not easy to traverse. There are humps and bumps, and curves and detours along the way,” Dureza said in a statement. \nOn Monday, Mr. Duterte said the government peace panel would not return to the negotiating table anytime soon as he had “entirely scrapped” the peace talks. \n“I don’t want being played around,” he told reporters. — REPORTS FROM GIL C.
