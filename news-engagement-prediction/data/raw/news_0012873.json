Amma 's spirit asked me to reveal some truth to the people of Tamil Nadu,\" he said, adding, \"When she was alive, Amma called me and said 'pick someone the people will accept'.\" \n\"When Amma was in the hospital and her health was not good, I was told we have the responsibility to save the party and government. I was first told Madhusudhanan should take over as general secretary. I didn't accept it. I opposed it. We all went and asked Chinnamma to take the post of general secretay and she agreed,\" he further said. \n\"I told them I was happy to have stepped aside for Amma when she was alive. I told them they can appoint whoever they want. I accepted the post only after they told me if I don't accept it will bring disrepute to the party,\" he pointed out. \nTalking about the sequence of events Panneerselvam said, \"On the second day of taking over as CM, health minister told me Diwakar wanted to say something to me. After the general council meet, I worked with utmost dedication to fulfill Amma's dreams. It was then that Vardah cyclone came, it was set right in four days. It was done as Amma's wished. This upset them. We also had water scarcity problem. We knew that AP had water. We met N Chandrababu Naidu (Andhra Pradesh CM) to get some water. He immediately gave it.\" \n\"Next came Jallikattu. I met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and explained the situation. While I was meeting PM, on the other side Thambidurai took 50 MPs and came to meet the PM. Revenue Minister RB Udhayakumar said Sasikala should take over as chief minister, when I was the CM. While I was doing my duty, Revenue Minister gave an interview to media that Chinnamma should be CM,\" he went on to say. \nPanneerselvam also said, \"I asked whether it is right that a minister who works for the CM should be saying this. I said that there will be trouble if this keeps up, I was told on phone that Udayakumar has been disciplined. Sellur Raju told me he didn't agree with Udayakumar, then he went to the hills and said the same thing. I'd said the Governor will ask me to prove majority if you give interviews like this.\" \n\"The entire country is shocked with the way the party is running. Why did they make me CM to insult me. I was given the CM post but insulted continuously. I have been told to be patient. I am patient only, always have been. Not even my smallest action should harm the party. Sellur Raju, Sengotaiyann, all spoke the same thing,\" he said. \nThe AIADMK leader maintained, \"The schemes announced in 2011 were praised by everyone. We have to take Amma's legacy forward I came to know that there was a meeting of the MLAs. I didn't have information. I was informed that Sasikala should take over as CM. When I asked what is the necessity, they told me one person should have both posts.\" \n\"Amma's soul told me to inform this to the people of the state,\" Panneerselvam said in the end. \nPanneerselvam had rendered his resignation on February 05 as Tamil Nadu CM citing 'personal reasons', setting the stage for takeover of Sasikala, who was elected as Legislature Party leader earlier that day, as chief minister of state. \n\"Due to my personal reasons, I am tendering my resignation from the post of Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Kindly accept my resignation and relieve the Council of Ministers of Tamil Nadu appointed by me on December 6, 2016,\" he had said in a letter addressed to Governor CH Vidyasagar Rao. \nMeanwhile, in a separate but near identical letter, Panneerselvam thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Governor Rao for all the support and cooperation extended by them during his term. \nPanneerselvam was appointed as Chief Minister on the night of December 5 within hours of the death of Jayalalithaa. \n(With Agency inputs)   22:32 More from zeenews", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T20:12:24.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
