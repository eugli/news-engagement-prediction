Niederreiter’s second goal was an empty-netter. \nDevan Dubnyk made 38 saves for the Western Conference-leading Wild, and Minnesota finished its road trip 3-1-0. \nJoel Armia had a goal and assist and Bryan Little scored his 15th goal of the season for Winnipeg. \nOndrej Pavelec went to the dressing room just over six minutes into the second period after stopping 11 of 14 shots. The Jets announced he wasn’t returning because of a lower-body injury. Connor Hellebuyck made 10 saves in relief for the Jets, who began a four-game homestand. \nMinnesota forward Mikael Granlund’s franchise-record 12-game point streak ended. He had five goals and 12 assists during the span, which had been the NHL’s longest current point streak. \nGranlund had a penalty shot early in the third but tripped over Hellebuyck while trying to go to the backhand. He was awarded the shot after defenseman Dustin Byfuglien pushed a loose stick on the ice toward Granlund when he had the puck in Winnipeg’s end. \nThe Wild led 2-0 after the first period and 3-2 following the second. \nAfter teammate Jason Zucker sent the puck over an open net, Niederreiter got the Wild on the board at 11:51 of the first when Pavelec couldn’t make a quick glove save to stop Niederreiter’s 16th goal of the season. \nWith 41 seconds left in the period, Jets rookie Patrik Laine turned the puck over in the neutral zone, and Pominville shot past Pavelec for the 2-0 lead. \nWinnipeg coach Paul Maurice started changing most of his lines in the second. It didn’t work at first, as Pominville netted his 10th goal of the season at 2:33 and Coyle picked up his 28th assist. \nThree minutes later, Little scored with a backhand shot after a scramble to find the puck in front of Dubnyk. \nShortly after Little’s goal, Pavelec left the ice and went to the dressing room. \nArmia’s high wrist shot on Dubnyk’s glove side squeezed the score 3-2 at 16:42, with the Jets finishing the middle frame with a 29-17 advantage for shots on goal. \nBoth netminders made some close saves in goal-mouth scrambles late in the third. \nNiederreiter’s 17th goal was an empty-netter with 1:19 left. \nNOTES: Earlier in the day, the Jets announced veteran D Tyler Myers, who’s missed 44 games this season, including the past 39 with lower-body injuries, had surgery for a different lower-body injury Monday and is out an additional six to eight weeks. \nUP NEXT \nWild: Host Chicago to begin an eight-game homestand that runs through Jan. 27. \nJets: Host Chicago on Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:47:39.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
