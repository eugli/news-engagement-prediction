Royal Mail said the new installation programme would ensure that more than 98% of households will be within half a mile of a post box. \nPlans to install 280 additional post boxes in England, 46 in Wales and 280 in Northern Ireland have also been announced. Efficient collections \nThe first tranche of installations should happen in spring 2017. \nRoyal Mail's operations Rob Jenson said: \"Access to post boxes is very important to our customers. \n\"This programme underlines our commitment to them and the Universal Service. \n\"The new boxes will benefit rural areas, which have not previously been served post boxes. \n\"We are also installing boxes in urban areas in response to changes in population and in new housing developments throughout the UK.\" \nRather than decommission uneconomic post boxes, Royal Mail says it has made collections more efficient.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T18:07:55.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
