He said “a young man in a suit” was handing the banners out before Trump’s speech. Here's up-close from #CPAC2017 attendee who kept his. Again -- says he just saw red, white and blue and made no connection to Russia. pic.twitter.com/LYdY7gahVU — Tim Alberta (@TimAlberta) February 24, 2017 \nCPAC attendees told Politico’s Tim Alberta they’d thought the person handing out the flags was a staffer. \nNorma McCorvey, Donald Trump and American women today \n“They saw red, white & blue — with ‘TRUMP’ stamped across it — and started to wave them,” he tweeted . “Gave no thought to Russian flag, they all said.” Crowd at CPAC waving these little pro-Trump flags that look exactly like the Russian flag. Staffers quickly come around to confiscate them. pic.twitter.com/YhPpkwFCNc — Peter Hamby (@PeterHamby) February 24, 2017 \nOrganizers reportedly told audience members anyone caught waving or holding the flags would be kicked out. \nAn attendee from San Francisco told The Hill he wanted to hold onto the Trump flag as a souvenir, but said no one has a sense of humor anymore. \nThe Trump administration has repeatedly come under fire for its cozy relationship with Russia. The President’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned just last week after leaks revealed he discussed Russian sanctions with an ambassador before Trump took office, then lied to the Vice President about the phone call.
