By Nicki Grihault, Telegraph Travel's Mauritius expert. Click on the tabs below for the best places to stay, eat, drink and shop, including the best things to do and what to do on a short break. Why go? \nWriter Mark Twain once said: \"You gather the idea that Mauritius was made first and then heaven was copied after Mauritius\". \nThe tropical island, once a haunt for pirates, is now best known as a safe haven with luxury hotels on white sand beaches with volcanic mountain backdrops. It is an island for exploring, with Indian temples, colonial houses, botanical gardens, and opportunities to spot rare birds among soaring ebony trees, walk with lions or swim with dolphins. Mauritians, a fusion of French, Indian, Creole and Chinese peoples, are renowned for their hospitality and visitors to the islands generally rave about the service. \nLuxury here is surprisingly affordable - Mauritius has some of the best value deals in the region. Reassuring remnants of the British colonial era remain in the Gymkhana Club, tea plantations and driving on the left, but gateaux piments and dhal puri stalls at markets, hip-wiggling sega performances and the ubiquitous dodo icon, add a touch of the exotic. \nPlentiful watersports, world class spas, top-flight golf courses and gourmet cuisine make it hard to leave the hotel, but Mauritius has plenty to see and do - from French colonial houses and imaginative animal parks to nature walks, quad biking, zip-lining and horse riding. \nThe tourism hub is in the north around Grand Baie, which has the greatest concentration of hotels, beaches and entertainment. The east coast is most renowned, with some of the most celebrated hotels and stretches of arguably the most beautiful white sand beaches, while the flat, calm beaches of the west coast are favoured by families. The \"beautiful\" south is the island’s wilder, but perhaps more interesting side. There are clutches of hotels in the southeast and more to be found squeezed onto calm stretches near pounding surf and clifftop walks in the \"green\" southwest. \nIt was writer Mark Twain who said: “You gather the idea that Mauritius was made first and then heaven was copied after Mauritius.” With that recommendation, it’s no wonder over 100,000 British visitors go each year. The best hotels in Mauritius When to go \nJust 20 degrees south of the equator, Mauritius promotes itself as ayear-round destination, although most people associate it with winter sun. The island's peak season extends from October to April, which is hot, humid and rainy, with a slight risk of cyclones January to March. The island's winter, from May to September, is warm and dry, with fewer mosquitoes and rates that drop by 30-50 per cent. \nThe north and west are more sheltered in our summer, and the east coast in winter. The north coast can be stiflingly hot in the Mauritian summer. The island has a microclimate - so it can be raining where you are, with the sun shining five minutes away. This is worth bearing in mind when planning activities. Where to go \nMauritius is famed for its white sand beaches, concentrated in the glamorous east and popular north, and on pristine offshore islands, reached by catamaran. It is also biodiverse, offering the chance to spot rare birds among soaring ebony trees on nature walks in the National Park, swim with dolphins off the west coast and encounter imported African animals at Casela, the island’s premier eco-adventure park. History has given rise to French colonial mansions, producing fresh game and artisanal rum, the exotic plants found in one of the world’s oldest botanic gardens and colourful Indian temples and markets. In the rustic south visit Le Morne Mountain, now a Unesco World Heritage Site, which was used as a refuge for runaway slaves in the 19th century. Know before you go \nFlight time: Around 12 hours from London; with a GMT +4 hour time difference, Mauritius is relatively jetlag-free. \nCurrency: The Mauritian rupee (MUR) is the island's currency. It can be purchased before you visit, but you'll get a better exchange rate in Mauritius. It's easy to exchange pounds and credit cards are accepted in hotels, large shops and restaurants. ATMS are found in most towns and tourist spots. The exchange rate fluctuates, but at the time of writing it's £1 = 43.6MUR. \nForeign Office Advice: ukinmauritius.fco.gov.uk Tourist information: tourism-mauritius.mu is the website for the Mauritius Tourism Promotion Authority (MTPA). \nEmergency numbers/contacts: British High Commission: 00 230 202 9400; police: 00 230 208 1212. \nLocal laws/etiquette/other tips: \nHospitality is central to Mauritian culture. Food and drink are always offered to unexpected guests - its polite to accept. \nWith differences in etiquette between communities, locals here are tolerant of a wide range of beliefs and behaviour, but although people appear westernised, Mauritius is a conservative culture. \nWhen visiting religious places make sure you're not bearing too much flesh and remove your shoes. Women should carry a sarong to double up as a skirt or headscarf when needed. \nSome local women still bathe in their saris, and nudism and topless sunbathing are not acceptable on public beaches.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:09:07.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
