Another 30 party MLAs are in another resort at Poonthandalam near Kalpakkam NEW DELHI/CHENNAI: The Madras high court on Friday asked the state police to file an affidavit on the status of AIADMK MLAs who have been lodged at two resorts. Chief minister O Panneerselvam has claimed that these MLAs have been kept hostage by the Sasikala camp. More than 90 AIADMK MLAs have been camping at a beach resort in Koovathur near Mahabalipuram since Wednesday night. Another 30 party MLAs are in another resort at Poonthandalam near Kalpakkam. The MLAs have been kept \"under watch\" as VK Sasikala battles rebellion from chief minister O Panneerselvam. According to sources, the MLAs are not being allowed to use their mobile phones and the television sets in their rooms have been disconnected. The Sasikala camp, however, claimed that the MLAs had willingly switched off their mobile phones as they are getting threatening calls. VC Arukutty, an MLA with OPS camp, has urged the governor to ensure that the MLAs must be released and asked to visit their constituencies and gauge the mood of the people. Meanwhile, former AIADMK MLA from Sankarankoil Muthulakshmi has joined the OPS group. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.
