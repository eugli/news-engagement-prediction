Chris Christie defends President Donald Trump as he said the rollout of the President's executive order suffered from \"terrible\" planning. (Julio Cortez/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, January 31, 2017, 5:44 PM \nPresident Trump “deserved much better” from staff responsible for the rollout of the travel ban targeting seven Muslim-majority countries, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Tuesday. \nThe embattled governor told NJ 101.5 radio that Trump’s executive order — which sparked protests at airports around the country — suffered from poor planning. \n“The rollout of this executive order was terrible — the way people were not involved or consulted,” Christie said. \n“The president deserved much better than the roll-out that he got out of this plan. I think that’s what caused a lot of the mistakes that were made. And those mistakes are unacceptable.” \nCounty prosecutors won't bring charges against Chris Christie \nKey federal officials were reportedly unaware of the ban until moments before Trump signed it into effect Friday. \nChristie — who was ousted from Trump’s transition team shortly after his election — said he knew the president had good intentions. \nThe 90-day ban was aimed at seven countries the White House said had dangerous links to terrorism. Refugees are also barred from entering the U.S. for 120 days. Syrian refugees are banned indefinitely. \n“His intention is to try to protect our country from terrorist attacks from people who mean to do us harm. However, I’ve always believed you need to make those decision based upon decisions, not on generalizations,” Christie said. \nThe governor has mostly stayed out of the spotlight since falling out of Trump’s favor. \nChristie also has fallen out of favor with his constituents in historic fashion. \nA whopping 78% of Garden State voters disapprove of Christie, a new Quinnipiac University poll found. The rating represents the lowest approval rating for any governor of any state in over 20 years of Quinnipiac polls, the university said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:05:51.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
