(Susan Watts/New York Daily News) Port Authority spokesman Joseph Pentangelo said agency brass “will review the request for harnesses and officers’ concerns.” He added that “the agency is seeking to install temporary safety fencing on the bridge as soon as possible.”\nAs part of a major renovation to the world’s busiest bridge, one walkway will reopen with a permanent safety fence in 2020, and another walkway will be upgraded by 2024, officials said.\nGWB Port Authority cops ask for harnesses to safely save lives \nFactors contributing to the cost and complexity of the project include the challenge of designing and installing a fence that is strong, yet porous enough to not strain the bridge’s steel in high winds, officials said.\nA net was placed over a decade ago beneath the Munster Terrace cathedral in Bern, Switzerland, and since then, no suicide attempts have been reported, according to California’s San Jose Mercury News.\nConstruction on a $204 million safety net beneath San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge is set to begin this year.\nRetired FDNY Deputy Chief Joe DiBernardo said he was outraged over the lack of safety gear for the GW Bridge's Suicide Prevention Team.

His son was a firefighter who died, along with three other firefighters, as a result of injuries he suffered in the Black Sunday tragedy of 2005.\nDiBernardo said his son could have survived if he had been equipped with a “bailout system” for escaping through windows.\nCops save two suicidal people on George Washington Bridge \nFDNY firefighters Joseph DiBernardo Jr., left, and his father Joseph DiBernardo Sr. appear in this undated photo.

We’re all looking out for each other,” Port Authority Patrolmen's Benevolent Association spokesman Bobby Egbert said.\nA Port Authority official also expressed gratitude, but said money was not causing the holdup, declining to elaborate.\nEgbert said cops manning the George Washington Bridge first submitted a request for harnesses around three years ago, and made subsequent requests.

That action does not include the officer the luxury of asking the suicidal person to please wait for ESU.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:48:43.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
