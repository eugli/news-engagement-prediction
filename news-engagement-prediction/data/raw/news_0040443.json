Suarez makes it clear with a hand gesture over his top lip. After the derision from his team-mates whether or not Neymar's moustache experiment makes it to kick-off on Tuesday night remains to be seen.

Whether Neymar will opt for a shave before Barcelona take on PSG remains to be seen Barcelona boast an impressive record of three wins in their past three meetings with the French Champions and the main reason for that success has been Neymar. The 25-year-old has scored in each of those victories, while he also netted in the previous match, a 3-2 PSG win.
