Rob Pelinka and Kobe Bryant (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:10 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:10 p.m. ET \nMagic Johnson is turning to the close confidant of another Lakers legend in his first act as president of basketball operations. \nRob Pelinka, a prominent NBA player agent who represented Kobe Bryant during his career in Los Angeles, will be named Lakers general manager under Johnson, The Vertical first reported . The sides were finalizing a multi-year deal Tuesday after Johnson was promoted to head the franchise, according to the report. \nEarlier in the day, Lakers president Jeanie Buss announced the dismissals of her brother, executive vice president of basketball operations Jim Buss, and longtime general manager Mitch Kupchak, with Johnson serving in both capacities for the time being. \nThe Basketball Hall of Famer was appointed to an advisory role under Buss only two weeks earlier. \nJohnson will serve as general manager through Thursday's trade deadline, when Pelinka is expected to take over. \nPelinka, 47, is the founder of Landmark Sports, and has served as an NBA player agent since 2003, with Bryant as his most prominent client. \nLast week, while speaking about his advisory role, Johnson made known his desire to involve Bryant in the franchise. \n“First call I make if I’m in charge? Kobe Bryant,” he said on ESPN's \"First Take.\" “Because Kobe understands winning. He understands, also, these players. So I would call, ‘What role you want? If you’ve got a day, just give me that day. I’ll take that. Whatever time he has, I want him to come and be a part of it.” \nPelinka's hire would seem to pave the way for Bryant's transition as a Lakers executive, should he desire such a position. \nThe 2008 NBA MVP and 18-time All-Star retired in 2016 after 20 seasons with the franchise.
