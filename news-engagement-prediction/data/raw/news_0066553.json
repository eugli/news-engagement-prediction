Last year it was one of the most talked about category that saw big names like Matt Damon, Michael Fassbender, Bryan Cranston, Eddie Redmayne and everyone’s favourite Leonardo DiCaprio battling it out. The ceremony is still remembered as it marked the first time that Leonardo DiCaprio finally won the golden statuette. This year it sees an unlikely contender in Casey Affleck, going head to head with Andrew Garfield, Ryan Gosling, Viggo Mortensen and Denzel Washington. Interestingly, all the films that the actors have been nominated for, have been nominated under the Best Picture category with only the exception of Captain Fantastic. In fact Viggo Mortensen’s nomination is the only nomination that Captain Fantastic has received at the Academy Awards. \nThe awards will be telecasted on February 26, 2017 i.e. February 27 (IST). \nLet’s take a detailed look at the nominations and our predictions for the winner of the Academy Award in the Best Actor category \nCasey Affleck, Manchester By The Sea \nThis is by far the best performance of the year, according to me. Casey Affleck’s grief stricken handyman will haunt you long after the movie ends. To know about his great acting prowess watch out for the scene immediately after the interrogation scene or the scene of his confrontation with his ex wife. No one can play a deeply damaged man better than him. After sweeping almost all the awards this season, he would definitely be eyeing the coveted Oscar. However, certain controversies that have been plaguing the actor might come between him and his award. \nAndrew Garfield, Hacksaw Ridge \nHis was the most understated performance in the film that was filled with blood and gore. But there are more than three performances that are better than his in this category. \nRyan Gosling, La La Land \nHis was one of the most all round performances. He sang, dance and acted and he was exceptional in all the three jobs he did. The film, that celebrates the city of Los Angeles, is by far the best film of 2016. And Ryan Gosling is one of the major reasons that made the film what it is today.

Having said that, it is not good enough when compared to others in the category. Viggo Mortensen should consider the nomination as a victory. \nDenzel Washington, Fences \nHe is the biggest threat to Casey Affleck’s victory. His win at SAGs was rather surprising and suddenly made him the hot favourite for the Oscars. Also, as mentioned above, Casey Affleck’s controversies aren’t helping him either.
