It was really important to me because it felt empowering and it gave me a voice. People were shocked when they read about it all. They couldn’t believe that in the blog I was laughing and joking about it but I just said if you don’t laugh you cry,” she said. \nElise said her first treatment was rough, leaving her with side effects including nausea, diarrhoea and fatigue. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:33:46.687+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
