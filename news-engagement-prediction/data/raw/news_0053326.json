Photo: Apple \nApple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar may have some serious keyboard problems. \nA number of new 2016 MacBook Pro owners are reporting issues with the new keyboard that features redesigned butterfly mechanism that were originally introduced on the super-thin retina MacBook. \nSome users have reported on Apple’s support forums that they’re experiencing random key repeat issues. MacRumors’ support forums have also been flooded with complaints of non-functioning keys, high-pitched sounds and keys with a non-uniform feel. New keyboard, new problems \nYouTube monstermac77 created a video showing how some of the keys on the new MacBook Pro make a high pitched sound when the machine is hot. Other users have experienced worse problems, like keys that are totally unresponsive or enter the same character twice. \n“My 2016 15” MacBook Pro arrived yesterday (as one of the first). 63 of the 64 keys work fine. But the i-key most of the time types the letter twice…With auto-correct it can be easy to think it works. However, my password contains the letter i, and I quickly became super frustrated not being able to get my password right.” \nMost of the complaints have focused on the 15-inch MacBook Pro, but some users are suffering issues with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar as well as the model without a Touch Bar. At this time it’s unclear what is causing the issue. \nMacBook Pro owners who are experiencing keyboard issues should bring their computers into their closest Apple store for repair. A number of owners have reported that Apple replaced their entire MacBook Pro. \nCult of Mac reached out to Apple for comment on issue but did not receive a response.
