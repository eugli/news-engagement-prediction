Miami Beach police said they found these guns in an apartment occupied by Ricky Weinberger. (Source: Miami Beach Police) \nPolice released a photo of the arsenal, which was a mix of assault rifles and handguns. \nBut what got Weinberger into big trouble was threatening Miami Beach city workers and police officers. \nOn December 28, 2016, a Miami-Dade judge Weinberger that he was not to have any contact with any Miami Beach police officers. The injunction included social media, email and text messages. \nYet Weinberger reportedly continued to harass officers with violent and vile threats on the phone to the police station, on social media and on a law enforcement website. \nIn court Monday, Weinberger refused to answer any questions. \n“I need to speak to my attorney before anything happens. I have not met him yet, you are violating my rights, you are violating my rights, you are violating my rights!” he said. \nJudge Mindy Glazer followed up by asking, “Do you have any money or property to pay for an attorney?” \n“I’d like to speak to my attorney before I answer any questions,” he replied. \nAnd though Glazer said he could answer that one question, Weinberger insisted he wasn’t going to answer any questions. \nWhen beach cops took Weinberger down, he threatened to kill them. Those threats led Glazer to recommend Weinberger undergo a psychological evaluation. Hank Tester facebook Follow Hank Tester is a CBS4 News general assignment reporter.
