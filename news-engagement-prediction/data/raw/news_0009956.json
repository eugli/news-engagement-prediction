Adarsh (25) of Neendakara near Kollam and Lakshmi (21) of Haripad succumbed to burns at medical college hospital here later in the evening.\nLakshmi was a final-year Bachelor of Physiotherapy student at the institution while Adarsh had completed the course in 2013. He had reached the campus to appear for a supplementary examination.\nGandhi Nagar sub inspector M J Arun said both of them were in an affair for around six months. Lakshmi had reportedly backed out of the relationship following suspicions about Adarsh's character but he continued to follow her. He had also approached her family with a marriage proposal. The family had lodged a complaint against him with Kayamkulam police a few days ago and a circle inspector had warned him.\nPolice said Adarsh tried to talk to Lakshmi on Tuesday. On Wednesday around 1pm, he reached the classroom where Lakshmi and some of her friends were sitting after pouring petrol on himself. He poured petrol over Lakshmi's body also and tried to set her on fire, when she ran out of the classroom. Adarsh finally set her afire at the library using a lighter he was carrying and tried to hug her.\nWitnesses said Lakshmi managed to get rid of his grip but she fell down soon gasping for breath. The other students doused the flames and rushed both of them to the hospital. \"Lakshmi had 65% burns and Adarsh 80%. Lakshmi had burns on her face too, which affected her respiratory system,\" resident medical officer Renjin R C said.\nTwo other students Ajmal Shahul and Ashwin were also injured while trying to rescue them. There were no regular classes at the institution on Wednesday owing to students' strike. Lakshmi had gone to the campus for some project works.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:51:50.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
