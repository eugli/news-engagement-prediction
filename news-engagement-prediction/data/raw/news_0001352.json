The tour follows no official script or itinerary. Instead, each “guide” offers a personal, first-hand account of what it’s like to live in an anarchist squatter community where decisions are made in assemblies, where cannabis is openly traded, and where there’s an ingenious “architecture without architects”. A genuinely fascinating trip. • About £28pp, book on rundvisergruppen.dk Rafael Gomez-Moriana Copenhagen people’s kitchens Vegan dinner at Kafa-X. \nWhat I like the most about Copenhagen is all its volunteer-run places. My favourite is Kafa-X in Nørrebro. Brunch, language cafe, soup kitchen … what you find there depends on the moment you go. On Tuesday evenings, a vegan dinner is served for only 20kr (£2.30) at 7pm. Whoever wants to help can come around 4pm or after, to first go and pick up food that would otherwise be thrown away at the nearby shops, and a huge amount of bread and pastries donated by some bakeries. Then the volunteers decide what they will make out of what they received that day, and cook for around 50 people who come for dinner. It’s healthy, tasty, cheap, ecological and you can even take home bread and sometimes leftovers too. • Korsgade 19 An island labyrinth Samsø Labyrinten \nWell worth the hour on the ferry from Jutland, the sprawling Samsø Labyrinten is officially the world’s largest maze. A forest labyrinth formed by more than 50,000 trees and bushes, it spans 50 acres on the north side of the wind-powered island of Samsø. It’s great for families: kids love the sense of adventure in this fairytale setting complete with carved toadstools and woodland animals. You can choose to navigate your way to any of the eight end points in the labyrinth (all have varying degrees of difficulty). You must solve riddles and answer questions correctly at the T-junctions along the way, to ensure you are led in the right direction. Should you get a few wrong, the helpful staff will get you back on track. Pretending you’re in a race against time to rescue an infant relation from a spandex-clad David Bowie at the centre of the labyrinth only adds to the experience – but is of course – entirely optional. • Adult £8, child £7, samsolabyrinten.com Ruth Clark Dragør – a taste of authentic Denmark Photograph: BirgerNiss/Getty Images \nJust 12km from Copenhagen is the charmingly quaint and tranquil town of Dragør. Its intricate cobbled alleyways, between pastel-coloured houses and thatched cottages, are the perfect setting for a stroll. The locals are friendly, saying “ hej ” to passersby as they tend their roses bushes or cycle through the town. Free from traffic and off the tourist path, it was lovely to sit by the harbour with a pastry. Just past the harbour on a sandy ridge, you have an excellent view of the Øresund bridge as it stretches across to Sweden. Josh Johns Egeskov Castle and Titania’s Palace Photograph: Manfred Gottschalk/Getty Images \nThis striking moated medieval castle on the island of Funen lies dramatically in landscaped gardens. There are loads of interesting things to do, from a car and aeroplane museum to a treetop walk. A magnificent early-20th century doll’s house, Titania’s Palace, is on display in the castle. It has beautifully created miniature features, including a bible and a working finger-size organ in the chapel. • Entry £20/£12, egeskov.dk Ride the ‘sand worm’ and straddle the seas Grenen beach and the ‘sand worm’ bus. Photograph: Nick Brundle/Getty Images \nCharming Skagen, the town at Denmark’s northern tip, is the starting point for an easy cycle ride to Grenen beach. Enjoy riding through the natural beauty of pine forests and open heathland, before taking the Sand Worm (a tractor-trailer ride) across vast sand dunes to the colliding waves of the North and Baltic seas. Pose for a photo opportunity at this strange, natural phenomenon, with one foot in either sea, before taking time to spot seals on your return. • Cycle hire about £10 a day, skagen-cykeludlejning.dk Mistertod1 Vikings at Jelling world heritage site \nJelling is one of Scandinavia’s most important historical sites but is a refreshingly calm and contemplative place. The site of Harald Bluetooth’s 10th-century stronghold, it marks the foundation point of Denmark, quite literally, with two giant runic stones. It also has two impressive royal burial mounds and a family-friendly visitor centre that provides an immersive introduction to everything Viking, and is free to visit. Easily reached by train (90 minutes from Aarhus), it lies midway on a 1,000-year-old national footpath, the Ancient Road , and makes a great base for exploring Denmark’s rolling countryside.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:54:29.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
