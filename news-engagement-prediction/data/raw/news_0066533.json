I felt like I could never say anything to friends because people feel like it's contagious. \n\"It's a really rubbish thing that happens and it happens to so many people. All you really want in that moment is a hug.

After being worried for so long that it wouldn't be easy it just happened. \n\"And then I miscarried not long after that and I think part of me felt that would happen, because I felt that it was too easy. Because I felt that I hadn't earned it. If that didn't happen I wouldn't have Buzz and Buzz will forever be my silver lining.\" (Photo: Instagram / mrsgifletcher)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:50:05.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
