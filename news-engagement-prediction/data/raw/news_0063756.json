(Romain Maurice/Getty Images for InList) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  56 PM \nSammy Sosa would have been better off sticking to his ruse before Congress more than a decade ago that he doesn't understand or speak English well enough to testify on his own behalf. \nOn the day local PED cheat Alex Rodriguez was welcomed back as a special instructor at Yankees camp and hailed again for his work with the organization's young players, Sosa spoke about still being on the outs with the Cubs and MLB over his alleged steroids usage, taking martyrdom in his supposed pariah situation to an all-time high. \n\"It's like Jesus Christ when he came to Jerusalem. Everybody thought Jesus Christ was a witch, and he was our savior,\" Sosa told Chuck Wasserstrom, a former Cubs media-relations employee, in a blog interview earlier this week. \"So if they talk s--t about Jesus Christ, what about me? Are you kidding me?\" \nNo, Sammy, who are you kidding with this? \nSosa's dumb quotes this week extended past the Jesus comparison, too, including the gem that \"when nobody knew who Chicago was, I put Chicago on the map.\" \nNot to rehash all of them here, but Chicago Tribune columnist Steve Rosenbloom rattled off the top of his head about 25 or so fairly famous Chicagoans — from Halas to Capone to Enrico Fermi to Jordan to Ditka and Payton to Ernie Banks and Harry Caray to Oprah and on and on — who would beg to differ. \nRegardless, Sosa remains on the outs in Chicago. He has not been welcomed back with the Cubs since he was videotaped leaving the final game of the 2004 season in the first inning and then subsequently traded to finish out the final two seasons of his once-legendary career in Baltimore and Texas. \nVarious reports have suggested that the Cubs' owner, the Ricketts family, is still waiting for Sosa to fess up about his PED usage during his career before considering welcoming him back in the organization's good graces. \nOf course, this is the same organization that recently employed Manny Ramirez, who twice failed MLB-administered tests for performance-enhancing drugs. But whatever. \nMark McGwire — Sosa's slugging mate in the juiced-up 1998 assault on Roger Maris' single-season home run record — tearfully admitted in 2010 to using steroids during his career and has been employed as a hitting coach or bench coach with St. Louis, Los Angeles and San Diego since then. \nBarry Bonds is still considered a hero in San Francisco, and he obviously is back in good standing with MLB, despite being fired as Don Mattingly's hitting coach in Miami after one season last October. \nAnd even A-Rod, of course, appears headed by all accounts for an expanded baseball role with Hal Steinbrenner and the Yankees if he so desires despite his admitted past usage and his 2014 suspension over the Biogenesis scandal. While Mark McGwire has been welcomed back into the MLB fold, Sammy Sosa remains on the outside. Perhaps its due to his lack of accountability for his own actions. (TIM PARKER/REUTERS) \nSosa, who once was suspended for using a corked bat, later was outed by the New York Times as being part of baseball's 2003 anonymous survey testing list on PEDs. He added that he would \"never say no\" if the drought-busting World Series champions agreed to welcome him back, but stubbornly maintains he has \"too much pride\" to make the first move, or apparently to admit any guilt. \n\"A lot of people say so many things, but I'm telling you — they have nothing on me,\" Sosa said. \"I'm not going to go out there begging, because they have no case. They had the Mitchell Report trying to find something, but they had nothing on Mr. Sosa.\" \nDespite 609 career home runs, including more than 60 in three of four seasons between 1998 and 2001, Sosa garnered just 8.6 percent of Hall of Fame votes in January, his fifth time on the ballot. \nThat's clearly not happening anytime soon, probably not ever. \nBut now that his ability to speak English has miraculously returned, Sosa would be better off using it to come clean if he truly wants to be welcomed back by the Cubs and by a sport that once adored him. OUTTA BOTTE EXPERIENCE \nPeople are surprised the Yankees are going to gouge fans on the ticket prices for Derek Jeter's number retirement ceremony in May? \nJust wait until they retire $275,000,000 in honor of A-Rod one day. Jeanie Buss, who fired her brother on Tuesday, is cold-blooded. And we like it. (Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) \n— What, you thought Magic/Buss was just another old song by The Who? \nJeanie is cold-hearted, though, and I kind of dig it. Phil, Kupchak and her own brother in the span of a couple of months? \n\"Each time I go a different way. Too much, Magic/Buss. \n\"Every day you'll see the dust. Too much, Magic/Buss.\" \n— If I'm a Mets fan, I can do without the pictures of Steven Matz or any of the other injury-prone pitchers reaching out of a fishing boat to pet sharks. \nThat story has \"Mets gonna Met\" written all over it.
