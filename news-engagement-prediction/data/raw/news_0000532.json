This team just clinched its record-breaking ninth Super Bowl berth and its seventh in the past 15 years. Here’s some fun trivia worth memorizing before they take on the Atlanta Falcons. 1. THEY WEREN'T THE FIRST PRO FOOTBALL TEAM TO REPRESENT BOSTON. \nMassachusetts began flirting with pro football long before the New England Patriots came along. The Boston Bulldogs were created and dismantled in 1929. The Boston Redskins (originally the Braves) came next in 1932, but, after five years, they relocated to Washington, D.C. 2. THEY WERE FOUNDED AS THE \"BOSTON PATRIOTS.\" \nThe Patriots organization began as the “ Boston Patriots ,\" and they were founded as part of the American Football League on November 16, 1959. 3. THEY WON THE AFL'S VERY FIRST PRE-SEASON GAME. \nOn July 30th, 1960, the Patriots won the upstart American Football League’s very first pre-season game by toppling the Buffalo Bills 28-7. 4. A TRI-CORNER HAT USED TO ADORN THEIR HELMETS. \nModern Patriots may wear that star-spangled “Flying Elvis” logo, but their forebears spent the 1960 season rocking a much simpler helmet design—one which consisted of a tri-corner hat sitting atop each player’s number. 5. THEY MOVED A LOT DURING THE 1960S. \nBetween 1960 and 1971, the Patriots changed venues four times. Nickerson Field, Fenway Park, Harvard Stadium, and Boston College’s Alumni Stadium all took turns hosting the team during that stretch. 6. IN 1970, A FIRE BROKE OUT IN THE STANDS. \nIn 1970, the Patriots's final game at Alumni Stadium was rudely interrupted when a popcorn machine beneath the bleachers caught fire, scattering a large section of the crowd. \"Fortunately, nobody was hurt,\" said radio announcer Gil Santos , \"and it wasn't a huge section of seats that were burned. After the fire was out, everybody found a seat, and the game continued. Popcorn sales, of course, went down.\" 7. THEY WERE GOING TO BE CALLED THE BAY STATE PATRIOTS, BUT THERE WAS A SLIGHT PROBLEM. \nUpon leaving for Foxborough, Massachusetts in 1971, they were re-christened as “The Bay State Patriots.” The name was rejected when people pointed out the abbreviation would be “The B.S. Patriots.” 8. IN THE EARLY YEARS, THEIR STADIUM HAD SOME TOILET PROBLEMS. \nSchaefer Stadium (a.k.a. Foxboro Stadium) wasn’t exactly Buckingham Palace. In 1971, the Pats's longtime residence just barely passed a mandatory “flush-off” test —wherein health inspectors flushed every single on-property toilet simultaneously. The test was ordered after hasty repairs were made when it was discovered that the plumbing was insufficiently prepared. 9. A SNOW PLOW OPERATOR BECAME A SPORTS HERO IN 1982. \nOn a harsh, wintry day in 1982, snowplow operator Mark Henderson became a New England folk hero when he cleared a patch of field for Patriots kicker John Smith, whose late field goal slew the visiting Miami Dolphins. Incidentally, at the time, Henderson was there on work release from prison. 10. THE 1990S DID NOT GET OFF TO A GREAT START FOR THE TEAM. \nThe year 1990 was unkind to New England football fans. Not only did the Patriots amass a franchise-worst 1-15 record, but in 11 of those losses, they never even led once. 11. THEY ALMOST MOVED TO ST. LOUIS. \nWhen Missouri native James Orthwein bought the Pats in 1992, he had a single goal in mind: shipping them off to St. Louis. However, at the time, Foxboro Stadium was owned by Robert Kraft, who effectively nixed the idea and purchased Orthwein’s franchise two years later. 12. THEY ALMOST GOT SHIPPED OFF TO CONNECTICUT, TOO. \nNew England escaped relocation again in 1998. Businessmen from Hartford, Connecticut, attempted to lure Kraft's Pats out of Massachusetts by offering a brand-new, publicly financed stadium. This blockbuster deal fell through when Kraft managed to secure $72 million from the Bay State, with which he eventually constructed Gillette Stadium—the squad's current home. 13. TOM BRADY'S COLLEGE CAREER DIDN'T PORTEND HIS SUPERSTAR STATUS. Getty Images \nHe may be a future Hall of Famer, but during his collegiate days , nobody would’ve mistaken Patriots QB Tom Brady for a big-shot. At one point, Brady was the seventh quarterback on the University of Michigan’s depth chart. 14. BRADY COULD HAVE PLAYED PRO BASEBALL INSTEAD. \nSpeaking of Brady: the Montreal Expos drafted him as a catcher in 1995. (He didn't play.) 15. THE TEAM'S SUPER BOWL VICTORIES HAVE BEEN CLOSE. \nEach of New England’s four Super Bowl v ictories was decided by four points or fewer. 16. THEY'VE GOT THE LONGEST WINNING STREAK IN PRO FOOTBALL HISTORY. \nThe franchise claimed 21-straight regular and postseason wins from 2003-2004, an NFL record . 17. IT TOOK NEARLY 30 MINUTES FOR EITHER TEAM TO SCORE IN SUPER BOWL XXXVIII. \nThough the Pats eventually prevailed over Carolina in Super Bowl XXXVIII, viewers had to wait 26 minutes and 55 seconds before either team scored. However, the teams scored 37 combined points in the fourth quarter, the most ever in a single quarter of a Super Bowl. 18. VLADIMIR PUTIN MIGHT HAVE ONE OF ROBERT KRAFT'S CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS. Getty Images \nVladimir Putin: jewelry thief? Kraft claims that, while visiting Russia, he had to bid one of his championship rings “dasvidanya.” Allegedly, President Putin had asked to hold it, remarking “I could kill someone with this ring.” Kraft complied, at which point the statesman pocketed the keepsake and left. Kraft later said it was a gift. Putin curiously said he has no memory of the event. “You know, I do not remember either Mr. Kraft or the ring,\" he told AFP . \"They handed out some sorts of souvenirs.\" 19. GAME OF THRONES AUTHOR GEORGE R.R. MARTIN HAS LIKENED THE TEAM TO THE LANNISTERS. \nGame of Thrones creator and Giants/Jets fan George R.R. Martin has said that, in his mind, the Patriots are the NFL’s Lannisters. 20. BILL BELICHICK RENAMED HIS BOAT AFTER THE 2015 SUPER BOWL. Getty Images \nHead coach Bill Belichick —who won two Super Bowl titles as a defensive coordinator with the Giants and four as head coach of the Pats—owns a boat he calls VI Rings . Up until 2015, it had been known as V Rings , but he renamed it in 2015, after the Patriots won Super Bowl XLIX. Who knows? After this Sunday, he just may have to re-christen it VII Rings . (We’re betting he wouldn’t mind the touch-up.) \nAdditional Sources : Then Belichick Said to Brady…: The Greatest New England Patriots Stories Ever Told, by Jim Donaldson The Patriot Way: The History of the New England Patriots", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:28:02.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
