Editor Advertisement \nAnother news of a very healthy man falling unconscious while doing his own physical training, and subsequently dying. This time, it happened to a regular SAF man, who collapsed at Nee Soon Camp early in the morning yesterday, while doing his own physical training. \nAlthough being in an army camp, and medical facility were available, all efforts to try to revive the man failed. We will never know why a seemingly healthy man can just collapse and die. In fact, a lot of these kind of incidences are happening. Is it because of our hectic lifestyle, that even with regular physical training, our bodies seemingly can just give up on us? \nIf a man in his prime can be taken down so soon, then those of us who are not training regularly have also to be more careful, and try to lead as healthy a life as possible. We never know when it is our time to go. \nSamuel N \nA.S.S.
