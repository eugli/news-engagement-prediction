She was packed, rented a U-Haul and ready to move into her new place. Story continues below \nBut things began to go sideways when the woman who she signed the lease with called to say the place wasn’t ready. \n“She texted me early in the day saying we’re going to have to postpone that,” Magnan said. \nThen Magnan met Austin Hunchak through Facebook and realized they had something in common. \n“We had the identical stories,” Magnan said. \nHunchak and Magnan had rented the same condo from the same person. \nHunchak was supposed to take possession January 1 while Magnan was slated to move February 1. \nStu Lindsdell is the property manager for the unit. He said he’s aware there have been complaints about the occupants renting out the unit to several people at the same time. \nLindsdell said the tenants are actually renters and don’t have permission to sublet. \n“We made a phone call and said if this is happening it’s got to stop now,” Lindsdell said. \nAfter threatening to go to the police, Magnan got her money back. \nBut Hunchak is out thousands of dollars, mostly for hotel bills. \nHe did get a cheque from the leasers but says it bounced. \nDespite being on the losing end of a deal that seemed to be too good to be true, Hunchak hopes others can learn from his troubles. \n“It happens to the best of us. I was just happy to be able contact other people prevent this from further happening.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
