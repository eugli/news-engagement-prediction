Herndon Globe Staff February 17, 2017\nWASHINGTON — President Trump, revealing an unusually high degree of sensitivity to news coverage for a White House occupant, repeatedly excoriated the media in a hastily called, rambling press conference Thursday and pledged to hunt down and prosecute government leakers.\nThe president struck back strongly against negative characterizations of his administration’s early struggles, while disclosing that he has asked the Justice Department to investigate sources of embarrassing, blockbuster leaks about his aides’ contacts with Russia.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough Trump provided few details while responding to questions about Russia, he did say that ‘‘nobody that I know of’’ on his campaign staff had contacted Russian officials.\nIn the freewheeling, hour-and-15-minute session, he also said he has a plan to get his promised Obamacare repeal, which is stalled in Congress, back on track. And he said he plans to reveal next week a ban on refugee immigration to replace his first, ill-fated order that is tied up in federal courts.\nGet Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell. He portrayed himself as battling mightily to clean up the previous administration’s problems.\nView Story Trump campaign sends survey on media bias that is, well, pretty biased A survey e-mailed by President Trump’s campaign on the media tends to lead participants in a certain direction by the way questions are phrased.\nFact check: Trump said he ‘inherited a mess.’ Did he really? Read the full transcript from Trump’s news conference\n“To be honest, I inherited a mess,’’ Trump said.\nTrump sparred with reporters, branding a frequent foe, CNN, as “very fake news” and saying the “level of dishonesty” from the press was “out of control.” At times, he seemed to revel in the spotlight, using a flippant tone on somber topics, at one point off-handedly mentioning and then dismissing the possibility of firing missiles at a Russian ship that is near the American coast.\nAdvertisement\nTrump has has long seemed to have a love-hate relationship with the media, a complicated approach that he has now brought with him to the pressure-cooker of one of the most powerful offices in the world.\nBut he has experienced multiple setbacks in his first weeks in office, from a rocky rollout of his travel ban for immigrants from seven majority Muslim countries; to the forced resignation of his national security adviser, Michael Flynn; to the withdrawl of his Department of Labor secretary nominee Andrew Puzder in the face of Republican opposition. His stream of sometimes inflammatory tweets — which began on Thursday morning, for instance, at 4:58 a.m. — also generate daily news coverage and shock in the nation’s capital.\nWhile the damage has mostly been self-inflicted by a new president and a White House team that has little government experience, Trump made clear Thursday that he sees negative coverage of his administration as a central barrier to his presidency’s success.\n“I turn on the TV, open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine — despite the fact that I can’t get my Cabinet approved,’’ Trump said.\n“The tone is such hatred. I’m really not a bad person, by the way,’’ he added during one of many diatribes in the press conference.\nThroughout the press conference, Trump made clear he watches news shows and reads articles, often citing specific stories and their authors.\nTrump sought to debunk specific reports on his campaign’s contacts with Russia in the “failing New York Times’’ and another in The Wall Street Journal about intelligence officials limiting the content of presidential briefings. He added that he was trying to speak directly to the American people and to bypass the media filter.\n“The public doesn’t believe you people anymore,’’ he told the assembled reporters in the East Room.\n“He was just doing his job,” Pres. Trump says of Michael Flynn’s contact with Russia\nTrump attempted to explain why he demanded Flynn’s resignation after it was revealed that Flynn discussed Obama administration sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to the United States on Dec. 29, while former president Barack Obama was still in office. Many details still remain unknown about the episode, including why Vice President Mike Pence did not learn the truth behind Flynn’s call until The Washington Post reported it last week. Pence had appeared on national TV more than three weeks before the Post report and, based on Flynn’s personal assurances, told the public that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Russia.\n“He didn’t tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn’t remember. And that just wasn’t acceptable to me,’’ Trump said.\nBut Trump said that he saw nothing wrong with Flynn talking to the Russian representative about sanctions in the first place, although a federal law called the Logan Act could prohibit such communications, depending on what was said.\nHe also branded media coverage of Russia — apparently referring to Russia’s hacking and influence on the election in his favor, to his campaign’s reported contacts with Russian intelligence officials — as “fake” and “a ruse.”\n“Russia is fake news. Russia — this is fake news put out by the media,’’ he said.\nTrump raises spectre of ‘nuclear holocaust’ amid questioning over Russia\nTrump also responded angrily to a question about whether he or his administration has inspired a wave of anti-Semitism, citing his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n“I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person,’’ he said. “I hate the charge, I find it repulsive.’’\nBut again and again, Trump’s preoccupation with media coverage seeped into his responses. He dropped more than 35 media-related insults, according to to informal tallies.\nEven when someone asked a softball question about Melania Trump reopening the White House visitors’ center, he denounced the press.\n“She’s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies,’’ he said.\nThe announced subject of the news conference was to name his new pick to head the Labor Department — Alexander Acosta, who would be the first Latino in Trump’s Cabinet.\nImmediately after the press conference, Trump’s campaign committee sent an e-mail — evidently prepared in advance — that doubled down on his line of attack.\n“You know that I don’t trust the media to report on anything we achieve,” said the e-mail, written in Trump’s name and including a survey full of loaded questions about media coverage of Republicans and conservative issues. “Instead, you — the American people — are our last line of defense against the media’s hit jobs.”\nOn the subject of leaks to the media, Trump said he was upset about disclosure of his calls to Mexico and Australia, as well as intelligence leaks about his associates’ contacts with Russia. He suggested the leaks were coming from holdovers from the prior administration, and said he has asked the Department of Justice to investigate.\n“What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information?”\n“Those are criminal leaks,’’ he said. “I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in.’’\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly praised Wikileaks and its founder Julian Assange and, at one point, seemed to encourage Russians to hack his Democratic rivals.\nTrump has some backing for leak investigations in Congress, but it is not uniform support. Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, and Bob Goodlatte, who leads the House Judiciary Committee, wrote a letter to the Department of Justice inspector general calling for an investigation into leaks of classified information.\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan has also called for an investigation into leaks.\n“We have serious concerns about the potential inadequate protection of classified information here,” wrote Chaffetz and Goodlate in their letter. “The release of classified national security information can, by definition, have grave effects on national security.”\nBreaking from members of his party and the White House, Republican Senator John McCain said that, while the scale of the leaks from this White House are unprecedented, he was more concerned with the information they provided.\n“The way this town operates is on leaks, we all know that,” McCain said. The White House “needs to start going through a regular process of decision-making, and that’s what they’re not doing. Who is making the decisions?”\nThe Arizona senator, who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services and a decorated veteran, dismissed concerns that the leaks could endanger national security. The news stories prove, from a national security perspective, that the White House is currently “dysfunctional,” McCain said.\n“We’re in uncharted waters,” McCain said. “We’ve never had a national security adviser tell false information to the vice president of the United States.”\nTrump has plenty of precedent to look to in seeking to stop information leaks. His Democratic predecessor pursued action against about 10 leakers, more than past presidents combined, said Steven Aftergood, the director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists.\n“From a president’s perspective, a leak is often an act of defiance and an obstacle to effective leadership,” Aftergood said. “So the outrage [from Trump] is normal and unsurprising.”\nA reporter called out President Trump on his faulty electoral college math\nRelated Fact check: Trump said he ‘inherited a mess.’ Did he really?
