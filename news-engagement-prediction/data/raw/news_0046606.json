Tommy Livingston \nThis gnome may find his way home after being stolen and sold, likely for meth. \nSergeant Cam Donnison said officers quickly realised some of the colourful items splashed around the property were ornaments which had been reported missing over the past few months. \nREAD MORE: \nCloser inspection revealed all of the items were probably stolen. Tommy Livingston \nSome of the large pot plants which were seized from the property. \nDonnison said there was a growing trend in Hawke's Bay of people stealing garden decorations then selling, or trading them, to get money for methamphetamine. \n\"It was obvious straight away they were stolen. We were aware of the issue. It seems to be the fashion at the moment. They are taking these items to hock off for methamphetamine – it's all meth driven,\" he said. \n\"We are probably looking at three to four hundred different ornaments. They go all through the house as well. These are probably the result of dozens and dozens of burglaries in the last month.\" Tommy Livingston \nOne of the pink flamingos dotted around the garden. \nIt was unclear whether the owner of the property had been receiving the gnomes and statues as a payment for meth, or if they had been buying them. Ad Feedback \nWhat was clear, Donnison said, was the person knew they were receiving stolen goods because they had painted some of the items to disguise them. \nThe massive find came less than a week after Hawke's Bay police appealed publicly for information into the growing problem of garden items being nicked. TOMMY LIVINGSTON \nMore of the gnomes who were stolen from gardens across Hawke's Bay. \n\"This is certainly organised and targeted burglaries to steal items which are worth quite a bit of money,\" he said. \n\"The perpetrators are stealing them to get rid of them easily, and quickly satisfy their methamphetamine addictions.\" \nIt was not uncommon for people to be getting upwards of $300 for large pot plants, Donnison said. TOMMY LIVINGSTON \nThe \"gnominator\" was among the recovered garden ornaments. \n\"Some aren't worth a lot of money, but have been passed down by family members, so it's sad.\" \nDonnison said the growing trend was strange. \n\"Certainly the trend of stealing garden ornaments and where they are going is quite unusual of late ... Usually the theft of ornaments is linked to drunken hyjinx or young people having pranks.\" \nDetectives would be reaching out to the public over the coming days to try and return the items to their rightful homes. \nNo charges had yet been laid in relation to the stolen items, but inquires would be taking place, Donnison said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:55:19.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
