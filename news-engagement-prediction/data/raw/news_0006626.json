Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago said on Sunday it was “a dark moment in U.S. history” and that it was “contrary to both Catholic and American values”. \nLast February, while returning from a trip to Mexico, Pope Francis said then-candidate Trump’s view about building walls was “not Christian”. \n\n(Reporting By Philip Pullella; Editing by Angus MacSwan) Also on HuffPost Pope Francis Washes Refugees' Feet For Maundy Thursday Pope Francis Washes Refugees' Feet For Maundy Thursday 1 of 4 Pope Francis kisses the foot of a refugee during the foot washing ritual at the Castelnuovo di Porto refugees center.
