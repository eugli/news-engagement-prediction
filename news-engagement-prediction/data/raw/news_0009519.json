The leaders of the European People’s Party ( EPP ), Socialists and Democrats ( S&D ), and the Alliance of Liberals And Democrats for Europe ( ALDE ) groupings in the European Parliament railed against Malloch’s “outrageous malevolence regarding the values which define this European Union”, and insisted that he “should not be accredited as an official representative to the EU”.\n open letter has been shared on Twitter by Guy Verhofstadt, described as “high priest” in “the temple of European federalism” and the European Parliament’s chosen representative in the upcoming Brexit negotiations.\nTrump's possible EU ambassador nominee wants to disrupt EU.

Malloch is said to be close to Brexit campaign leader Nigel Farage, who has derided the MEPs plotting to block his appointment as “the real nationalists”.\nMalloch claims that the new president and the former UKIP chief share much the same view on Brussels: “[Trump] doesn’t like an organisation that is supranational, that is unelected, where the bureaucrats run amok and that is not frankly a proper democracy.”\n Breitbart London , ALDE , Brexit , Donald Trump , Donald Tusk , EU , Europe , European Parliament , European People’s Party , European Union , Ted Malloch", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/PES_PSE", "http://alde.eu/en/", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ttip-ukip-lead-dramatic-eu-5858981", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F03%2Feuropean-left-plots-block-trumps-pro-brexit-eu-ambassador%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=European+Left+Plots+to+Block+Trump%E2%80%99s+Pro-Brexit+EU+Ambassador&shortener=bitly", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUCO?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/giannipittella", "https://twitter.com/EPP", "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/jean-claude-juncker-blocked-eu-curbs-on-tax-avoidance-cables-show", "https://twitter.com/GuyVerhofstadt/status/827199163305705473", "https://twitter.com/ManfredWeber", "https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/827208472236277761", "https://twitter.com/eucopresident", "http://www.tedmalloch.com/my-life-behind-the-elite-curtain-as-a-global-sherpa/", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F03%2Feuropean-left-plots-block-trumps-pro-brexit-eu-ambassador%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=European+Left+Plots+to+Block+Trump%E2%80%99s+Pro-Brexit+EU+Ambassador", "http://www.socialistsanddemocrats.eu/sites/default/files/Letter_Pittella_President_Tusk%20170202.pdf", "https://twitter.com/TheProgressives", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Flondon%2F2017%2F02%2F03%2Feuropean-left-plots-block-trumps-pro-brexit-eu-ambassador%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=European+Left+Plots+to+Block+Trump%E2%80%99s+Pro-Brexit+EU+Ambassador", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Trump?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/JunckerEU", "https://twitter.com/TheProgressives/status/827443485162819584"], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T17:14:18.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
