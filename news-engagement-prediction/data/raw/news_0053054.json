The claim was rejected by the judges.\nThe trial opened last May at a military courtroom in Tel Aviv’s Jaffa district, but later moved inside to a tightly-guarded military complex.\nPolice have made arrests over online death threats against a judge and other officials and the army has assigned bodyguards to the three judges who convicted Azaria.\nAnother man was arrested on suspicion of inciting violence against armed forces chief of staff Lieutenant General Gadi Eisenkot, who ordered the prosecution of Azaria, during a rowdy protest immediately following the verdict.\n“Police are ready for any exceptional incident,” police spokesman Luba Samri told AFP. “Police are prepared for any scenario, anywhere in the country.”\nAround 100 demonstrators protested outside the court against the sentence, an AFP photographer on the scene said.\nAzaria entered the packed courtroom around midday (1000 GMT) to applause from friends. Dressed in military uniform and smiling broadly, he hugged family members and his girlfriend.\nBefore the judge entered, his father Charlie told his supporters to respect the ruling.\n“None of us have any expectations, we shall accept the sentence whatever it may be,” he said.\nRight-wing Israelis have argued he has been abandoned by the army and his leadership.\nAround 100 demonstrators protested outside court against the sentence, an AFP photographer on the scene said.\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said he favoured pardon for Azaria and called up his father to express sympathy.\nEducation Minister Naftali Bennett, head of the radical Jewish Home party, also urged clemency.\n“This soldier should not spend a single day in prison. If he is found guilty, he should immediately be pardoned,” he said in a radio interview in October.\nA poll by pro-Netanyahu newspaper Israel Hayom found that around 70 per cent of Israelis favoured a pardon for Azaria.\nThe dead Palestinian’s father, Yusri Al Sharif, says Azaria deserved a life sentence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:57:00.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
