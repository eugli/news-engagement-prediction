Jenny Erikson \nIt's official! David Eason finally put a ring on it , and now he and Jenelle Evans are engaged. The couple announced the news on Saturday, February 11, and the Teen Mom 2 star showed off her stunner of a ring. \nJenelle posted this adorable pic on Instagram, and added the caption, \"We've decided on forever! #PerfectTiming.\" A photo posted by Jenelle Evans (@j_evans1219) on Feb 11, 2017 at 1:02pm PST \nDavid and Jenelle just welcomed their first child together on January 24, and adorable baby girl named Ensley Jolie. It's Jenelle's first daughter, and she joined big brothers Jace, 7, and Kaiser, 2, from previous relationships. \nMore from CafeMom: Jenelle Evans Shows Off Her Already Slimmed-Down Belly on Snapchat \nWe couldn't be happier for Jenelle! It's been a rocky road for her over the years, but it seems like she and David make each other really happy. We're just hoping they broke the news to her mom Barbara Evans before posting about it on Instagram. Everything is going so well for her, we'd hate to see unnecessary added drama in her life. \nCongrats again to the happy couple!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T21:22:23.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
