It said it was now \"deeply sorry\".\nIn December Dodds admitted indecently assaulting four men and a young boy.\nIn the 1970s Dodds, of Cotswold Road, Sheffield, was responsible for providing grants to college and university students.\nThe court heard he had used his position to abuse teenagers, forcing students to engage in sexual acts in order to get grant payments.\nThe five victims were at Sheffield Crown Court to hear him sentenced.\nThe council have said they are 'deeply sorry' that Dodds committed these offences while working for them.\nThe five victims were at Sheffield Crown Court to hear Dodds sentenced Credit: PA Jayne Ludlam, Executive Director for Children, Young People and Families, said: “We welcome the fact that today Roger Dodds has finally been brought to justice, after so many years.\n“Our thoughts go out to his victims, whose bravery in coming forward has resulted in Dodds’ conviction and subsequent sentencing.\"\nWe are deeply sorry that Dodds committed these offences while working at Sheffield City Council decades ago. We are glad to see that, finally, such cases of historic abuse are coming before the courts, justice is being done, and victims are having their voices heard.\nDespite the fact that this happened more than a quarter of a century ago, we have accepted responsibility and would never defend the indefensible.\nIn 2008, a complaint of historic abuse was made to South Yorkshire Police regarding an ex-employee of Sheffield City Council. As a result, we at the council commissioned an in-depth, independent investigation into this allegation, which highlighted how things had happened at the council in the past.\nBy 2008 major changes had already occurred in policies, practices and procedures both at the council and in wider society, but we needed to know if there was anything more that we could learn. This independent report made recommendations, all of which have been implemented fully.\nWe tackle abuse head-on, provide care and support to victims, and do everything we can to ensure perpetrators are brought to justice.\nWe urge all victims of sexual abuse to come forward as soon as possible so they can get the support they need and offenders can be brought to justice.\n– Jayne Ludlam, Executive Director for Children, Young People and Families Investigating officer Detective Constable Stephen Howson said: “Today marks the culmination of a lengthy police investigation into Dodds’ sexual abuse of multiple victims, which spanned the 1970s to 1990s.\n“Our inquiry began in 2014, after we received information from one victim who bravely reported sexual abuse to the NSPCC.\"\nWe launched an investigation, which lead to the discovery of other victims of Dodds’ sexual offending.\nI hope the positive result at court today encourages other victims of sexual abuse to come forward and talk to someone. We will always investigate reports of this nature and will do whatever we can to bring perpetrators of this crime before the courts.\nIf there are other victims out there who are yet to come forward, please know that we are here to listen and support you.\n– Investigating officer Detective Constable Stephen Howson Last updated Fri 3 Feb 2017 Sheffield South Yorkshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T01:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:57:16.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
