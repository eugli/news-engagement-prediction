Rather than using chemical sprays to keep out pests, the project, developed by salad supplier Wingland Foods, will introduce beneficial insects such as ladybirds to eat any bugs that could damage the plants. The fact that the salad is being harvested in Worcestershire, rather than Murcia, in southern Spain, means they are much fresher when they reach customers. British-grown salad leaves will be sold 365 days a year with crops being grown in vast greenhouses under LED lights (file picture) Procurement manager at Wingland Foods, Rob Stevens, said: ‘Our expert team are working on expanding the range of leaves available and bringing in new varieties of leaf, as well as ensuring the consistency in flavour, texture and size that is delivered to customers.’ Head of fresh produce at Waitrose, Nicola Waller, said: ‘It’s great to see the first of our British salad bags hitting the shelves so early in the season. ‘Developing this innovative new way of growing salad leaves means that we can source from the UK all year round, going even further in our commitment to British farming.’ It comes after an appalling run of weather in Spain, including drought, floods and snow, ruined crops this winter. As a result, British stores were forced to ration sales of lettuces, broccoli, courgettes, aubergines and cabbage.
