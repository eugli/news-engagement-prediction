Rec Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports Free agent point guard Deron Williams plans to sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday, according to The Vertical’s Shams Charania . Williams and the Dallas Mavericks reached a buyout agreement on Thursday, per Charania, and he cleared waivers on Saturday. He considered signing with his former Utah Jazz team, but ultimately decided to join the defending champion Cavaliers on Saturday. A three-time All-Star, Williams is set joins a Cleveland team boasting just two point guards: All-Star starter Kyrie Irving and rookie guard Kay Felder. His expected signing comes on the heels of LeBron James ’ public demand for Cavaliers management to add a playmaker via free agency or the trade market. Cleveland’s addition of Williams follows its signing of versatile wing Derrick Williams to his second 10-day contract — one they are expected to extend for the remainder of the season. It also follows a trade to acquire veteran sharpshooter Kyle Korver from the Atlanta Hawks . The Cavaliers are expected to welcome back J.R. Smith (thumb) and Kevin Love (knee) from injuries before the playoffs. Williams enjoyed the heights of his NBA years as a pick-and-roll maestro for Jerry Sloan’s Utah Jazz teams, holding career averages of 16.6 points and 8.2 assists per game. He averaged 13.1 points and 6.9 assists through 40 games for this season for the Mavericks, who have moved rookie guard Yogi Ferrell into the starting slot.
