Workers and retirees learned of the scalebacks to their pension payouts just over a year ago. (CBC)\nThe workers lost medical benefits when the mine went into creditor protection.\nThe company also left the workers' pension plan underfunded by more than $45 million. When the plan was wound up in December of 2015, bargaining unit employees lost 21 percent and staff employees lost 25 percent.\nCliffs needs to better protect Wabush pensioners, Dwight Ball says\n\"For a lot of people, that's quite a substantial amount of money to lose\" Pynn said. \"Especially for widowsâ€¦ left them with a very small pension to live on.\"\nCliffs Natural Resources took the company into creditor protection, leaving the pension under funded by over $45 million. (CBC)\nWabush Mines 'done us very, very dirty,' widow says The group is hoping to recover some of the lost funds through Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) proceedings, now before a Quebec court.\nBut because the pension plan is considered an unsecured creditor, it does not get priority on a list of debtors.\n\"They are last on the list,\" Labrador West MHA Graham Letto said.\n\"Once the CCAA is wound up, all creditors that are owed money from the wind-down of Wabush Mines all would be paid first before the pensioners.\"\nMore protection in N.L. courts Pensioners hoped that stronger provincial legislation in Newfoundland and Labrador would give them priority as a creditor, though the judge overseeing the CCAA case recently ruled to keep the proceedings in Quebec, where the company also had assets and employees.\nThe judge did, however, leave the door open for the issue of \"deemed trust\" to be interpreted in courts in this province, if the government were to ask for it.\n\"We want the government to move forward with that appeal as quickly as possible so this gets heard in the province where we are retirees and we live.\" - Rita Pynn \"We want it heard in Newfoundland. We don't want it heard in Quebec,\" Pynn said.\n\"If we could get it heard [here] then there is a chance we may be able to obtain some funding for our pension plan that we've lost.\"\nDeemed Trust, a clause unique to pension rules in Newfoundland and Labrador, would give the pensioners priority as a creditor. Right now the Department of Justice says it is considering it.\n\"We want the government to move forward with that appeal as quickly as possible so this gets heard in the province where we are retirees and we live,\" Pynn said.\nLabrador West MHA Graham Letto says under current federal legislation the Wabush pension fund is last on the list when it comes to who will get paid back. (CBC)\nLetto said he expects to hear a decision from the justice department on that matter before the end of February.\nGood year for Cliffs While this issue is playing out in court, parent company Cliffs Natural Resources, based in Cleveland, is boasting big profits after a rise in iron ore prices.\nHerb Walsh worked at the mine for 35 years. He says he doesn't understand how Cliffs can get away without honouring its contract with pensioners. (Jacob Barker/CBC)\n\"They're not restructuring, they're liquidating their business in Canada,\" 35-year mine worker Herb Walsh said. \"In the states they're making more money than they ever had. We had a binding contract. How can you just turn around and throw that to one side.\"\nBloomberg News called Cliffs Natural Resources the \"the world's best raw materials producer\". Its stock was up 404 per cent at the end of last year and this year it's continued to rise.\nThe pensioners recently petitioned the federal government, whose legislation trumps provincial rules when it comes to CCAA proceedings, to hold foreign parent companies responsible for their Canadian subsidiaries' debts and responsibilities.\n\"Cliffs is a prime example. To allow them to exit Canada and leave the employees like they did in Wabush is nothing short of criminal, really,\" Letto said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:10:01.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
