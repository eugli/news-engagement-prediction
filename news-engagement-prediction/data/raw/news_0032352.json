In the photo Jenelle also showed off quite the stunning pear-shaped diamond engagement ring. Safe to say Eason has great taste, or just knows what his ladylove likes! \nWhat a time it's been for Jenelle and David, who welcomed their first child together in late January. The couple named their newborn baby girl Ensley Jolie Eason , and told E! News exclusively at the time, \"We are doing great. It was a quick delivery and only had to push twice. We are already in love with her, and she's so beautiful!\" Photos \nTeen Mom Stars: Then and Now \nEvans, who has two sons from previous relationships, started dating Eason in September 2015. Since becoming parents, the lovebirds have shared multiple photos of their newest bundle of joy, and it seems her boys, Jace Evans and Kaiser Griffith , are getting the hang of the big brother life. \nAfter documenting the birth of her first son on the popular MTV series 16 & Pregnant , Jenelle endured years of highly-publicized ups and downs. Despite multiple run-ins with the law, the reality television star has since turned her life around and committed to sobriety. \nCongratulations, you two!
