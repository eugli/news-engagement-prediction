He's extremely competitive, driven by a desire to succeed and an equally powerful desire to watch others fail. He can only be a winner if someone else is a loser ; his victory is void without a \"lesser\" person or entity against which he can juxtapose himself.\nWe know businessman Donald Trump wanted to win the presidential election , but does President Donald Trump actually want to be president ?\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Monday, The New York Times :\nCloistered in the White House, he now has little access to his fans and supporters — an important source of feedback and validation — and feels increasingly pinched by the pressures of the job and the constant presence of protests, one of the reasons he was forced to scrap a planned trip to Milwaukee last week.

He refuses to give up his personal cell phone and his desk in the Oval Office is already a total mess. None of this behavior is particularly shocking if you followed his campaign. And yet...\nWhere is the quiet exhale?\nThe sheer awe and admiration of the awesome responsibility at his fingertips?\nWhy did his tone sound vaguely sarcastic while taking the oath of office?\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Why, after amassing more power and influence than any other person on the planet, does he still seem so deeply insecure?", "external_links": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/esq.h-cdn.co/assets/17/06/1600x800/landscape-1486738445-trump-05.jpg?resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/esq.h-cdn.co/assets/17/06/1600x800/landscape-1486738445-trump-05.jpg?resize=480:*", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/05/us/politics/trump-white-house-aides-strategy.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-administration-leaks_us_589a45f1e4b04061313a1fbb?", "http://bigstory.ap.org/article/97308336a18a4cf8b1028185ca7858eb/trump-lonely-start-life-white-house", "http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/donald-trump-challenges-governing-presidency-234879", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/esq.h-cdn.co/assets/17/06/1600x800/landscape-1486738445-trump-05.jpg?resize=768:*"], "published": "2017-02-10T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:17:18.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
