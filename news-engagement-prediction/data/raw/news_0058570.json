The symbol is usually green and resembles a plant within a circle.\nHealth Canada noted that the United States has permitted the irradiation of ground beef products since 1999. Canada's beef cattle industry has been asking the Canadian government to approve ground beef irradiation since 1998.\nIrradiation is already used in Canada to treat potatoes, onions, wheat, flour, spices and some seasonings.\nMark Klassen, a spokesman for the Canadian Cattlemen's Association, said it's good news for consumers and beef producers.\n\"It is essentially an extra food safety measure. When you add it to all of the other things that we do today ... it could essentially eliminate illness from E. coli 0157,\" he said from Strathmore, Alta.\n\"We are serving hundreds of millions of beef servings. If we can go from a few cases of E. coli 0157 to none -- that is where we want to be as an industry.\"\nKlassen compared the health benefits of irradiated beef to the effect of milk pasteurization at the beginning of the last century.\nThe association renewed its call for beef irradiation following an extensive recall of beef products during the fall of 2012. E. coli linked to a former XL Foods plant in Alberta sickened 18 people in British Columbia, Quebec, Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador.\nKlassen said it will take about a year for the industry to provide irradiated ground beef to consumers. Supply will depend on demand.\nThe association represents 68,500 beef farms and feedlots mainly in Western Canada.\nHealth Canada said irradiated ground beef retains its nutritional value, taste, texture and appearance.\nThe department said it will consider requests to allow for the sale of other irradiated meat products based on the same review rules it used for ground beef.\nRelated Stories Health Canada to propose allowing irradiated ground beef to be sold Food irradiation: What is it and is it safe?
