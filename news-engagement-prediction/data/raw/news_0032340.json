Story continues below \n“Privacy and civil liberties are still important rights in this country, and (the) Ways and Means Committee is not going to start to weaken them.” \nThe Texas Republican was responding to questions about a Feb. 1 letter from Representative Bill Pascrell, a Ways and Means Democrat who asked Brady to obtain Trump’s returns from the U.S. Treasury so the committee could review them in closed session and vote on whether to release them to the public. \nREAD MORE: WikiLeaks issues Twitter plea for copy of Donald Trump’s tax returns \nPascrell’s office had no immediate response to Brady’s remarks. \nDefying decades of precedent, Trump has long refused to release the documents, which Democrats say could show whether his sprawling business empire poses any conflicts of interest as he moves forward with initiatives on issues ranging from tax reform to foreign relations. \nWATCH: Trump addresses ‘alleged tax filing’ claims; report suggests he didn’t pay taxes for 18 years \nExperts say federal law authorizes the House Ways and Means Committee, the Senate Finance Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation to examine individual returns. \nREAD MORE: Alec Baldwin fires back at Donald Trump: ‘Release your tax returns and I’ll stop’ \nThe two other panels are headed by Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who dismissed the idea of seeking Trump’s returns last week. \nHouse Republicans contend that the authority to examine tax returns was meant to ensure the proper administration of the tax code. Brady said his panel was doing just that in 2014, when it released confidential tax data during a probe of IRS treatment of conservative group applications for nonprofit status. \nWATCH: ‘Who knows the code better than me?’: Donald Trump on lowering taxes \nIn his letter, Pascrell said Trump’s business empire involves state-owned enterprises in China and the United Arab Emirates as well as interests stretching from Russia and Saudi Arabia to Taiwan and the Philippines. \n“It is imperative for the public to know and understand his … financial positions in domestic and foreign companies, and his self-reported net worth of more than $10 billion,” the New Jersey Democrat wrote. \nBrady said the letter misrepresented the law’s intent to promote confidentiality and privacy. \n“I’ve read his letter and I disagree with all of it,” the chairman said.
