Her parents initially discouraged her from choosing any form of art as a career as she was excelling academically at school. \nThusi said it took a lot of sacrifice and courage to finally convince them that design was her calling and that she could make a success of it. \n“Design is about breaking barriers, expressing ones’ emotions and doing the impossible,” Thusi said. \nMlambo said he had a difficult start to the year due to a lack of money and hoped the competition could help him. He was inspired by his mother’s love for furniture as a sales lady at a retail store in KwaZulu-Natal. \n“As kids we were also helping my father renovate houses and old buildings. This experience brought creativity and all sorts of ideas to us,” Mlambo said. \nDUT senior digital design lecturer Suzan Barrot said she was delighted that some of their students have been selected as finalists in the competition. \n“They now have to figure out exactly how this product is going to be made,” she said.
