Norfolk saw an increase of 371 per cent and the rise in Lincolnshire was 345 per cent.\nLast summer Barnardo's warned that child on child sexual abuse threatened to become the next major child protection issue. It backed calls for a national inquiry to examine the issue and urged government to develop a national strategy to tackle it.\nBarnardo's also believes that age-appropriate compulsory sex and relationship education (SRE) would better protect children and help them understand consent, respect and what a healthy relationship should look like.\nBarnardo's chief executive, Javed Khan said: 'Barnardo's warned last year that unless child on child sexual abuse is dealt with head on, it may become the next scandal in our society. These results are another wake up call to the extent of the problem.\n'We're deeply concerned more children may be sexually harming other children. We know this can be because they've been abused themselves and may not have received the right support to help them recover.\n'An estimated third of sexual abuse is carried out by children. Rehabilitating children so they don't go on to harm others is vital to preventing further sexual abuse. High quality age appropriate mandatory SRE lessons would help children recognise what a healthy relationship should look like.'\nNational Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection and chief constable of Norfolk police, Simon Bailey said: 'We believe we can attribute these increases to more awareness and greater victim confidence. We also have to look at the possibility that more abuse is being perpetrated and if technology is facilitating this.\nIn total, there were 32,452 reports to police of alleged sexual offences by children on other children over a four year period – an average of more than 22 every day (stock image)\n'These figures highlight the importance of building resilience in young people and educating them about sexual relationships. This can't be left to chance.\n'I know from my own force that we are engaging with schools more than ever to educate and raise awareness of both the different forms of abuse and how to get support. It is clear from the increase in the number of reports we are receiving how vital this work is.'\nNusrat Ghani, the Conservative MP who chaired last summer's cross-party inquiry on Harmful Sexual Behaviour (HSB) said: 'This latest research shows what a problem child on child abuse is, and why we need to tackle it. But it hopefully also shows that awareness of this issue is rising and that people are more likely to report instances of it to the police.\n'Our report was right to put this issue front and centre, because for too long it has gone unreported and not been understood. The Government must work with schools, local authorities, police and voluntary organisations to tackle it.\n'In this smartphone age, parents must also play a vigilant role in protecting their children from harmful sexual behaviour and from harmful sexual images that cause damage they are too young to understand.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:53:30.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
