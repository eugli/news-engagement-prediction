Article continues below \nThe former Chelsea boss was under investigation from the German Football Federation (DFB) after appearing to swear at Hertha fans following the final whistle. \nThe DFB wanted Ancelotti's take on events and understand why he did what he did, but it is understood they have now accepted an explanation and apology from the Bayern boss. Article continues below Man City accused of ‘killing football’ with new feature outside the Etihad \nBayern say the DFB have accepted the club's stance that it was \"an understandable emotional reaction\" after the 57-year-old manager claimed he had been spat at. \nThe statement read: \"We regard Carlo Ancelotti's gesture in response to being spat at as an understandable emotional reaction. \n'The DFB panel has accepted this position and will cease its inquiry. However, as an apology for his gesture Carlo Ancelotti will make a donation of 5,000 Euros (£4,200) to the DFB Foundation.' \nAt the time, Ancelotti was not trying to hide the incident whatsoever and told sports broadcaster ARD Sportschau: \"Yes, I made the gesture because I was spat on.\" \nSpitting at someone is a disgusting action in any scenario imaginable, and despite the fact that Ancelotti is the boss at one of the biggest clubs in the world, he still has the right to defend himself in such situations. \nStill, it's a great gesture from the Italian to essentially fine himself for his actions. \nIt has an air of 'I won't take any rubbish' but, 'I'm a role model' too. \nBayern will travel to the Emirates in two weeks time to try and wrap up their knockout tie against the red half of north London, but they have two league matches on top of a DFB Cup Quarter-final before then. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
