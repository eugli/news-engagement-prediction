It’s stressing me out, I’m trying to move on and I’m sick of Jade trying to ruin things for me. \n“I had hoped the restraining order would prevent this, I live in a different country, have a new job and Jade is trying to ruin this. \n“She has no reason why she can’t move on with her life as well. Some days she sends 50 to 60 messages. She keeps changing her number but I know it’s her because she sends me pictures of herself. \n“I’ve never seen or been to visit her at all since the court case, I can’t understand why she’s so obsessed with me.

JPs said the case was so serious it had to be sent to crown court for sentencing. \nChairman of the bench John Bolton told her: “Our powers are not sufficient to deal with this. Prepare yourself, you could quite easily be sent to prison for this. I don’t know how you feel but saying that anybody committed rape – I’m a man and I find that disgusting. \n“A baby as well, it’s not nice to be faced with that whether you were joking or serious. Your solicitor said that it’s finished with so show that it’s finished with.

It’s caused a great deal of upset. \n“There has been no repeat of this, she appears to have moved on and has found a new relationship, she is engaged. She wants to gain employment in the funeral industry and she appears to have finally let go and is not a danger to the public at large. \nOn her Facebook page, Morgan appeared to make repeated references about broken relationships. One post on Feb 12 this year said: ”Lads walk all over me and expect me to take them back when they treat me like nothing. Us women don’t need men like that.
