The call ended courteously.” \nHe added that Canberra had “very, very strong standards in the way we deal with other leaders and we are not about to reveal details of conversations other than in a manner that is agreed”. \nThe Post’s account is markedly different from the official read-out of the call provided by both governments. \nTurnbull said Monday that Trump had agreed to honor the deal struck with then president Barack Obama to resettle an unspecified number of the 1,600 people Australia holds in offshore processing centers in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. \nThere were fears the new US president would rescind it after he signed an executive order last week to suspend the arrival of refugees to the US for a least 120 days, and bar entry for three months to people from seven Muslim-majority countries. \n– Diplomatic crisis – \nAfter the Post story broke late Wednesday, Trump weighed in on Twitter and threw the agreement into doubt. \n“Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!” he wrote. \nAfter seeing the tweet, Turnbull insisted Trump had already agreed it would go ahead. \n“The commitment made by the president in that call was made and we announced that and it was confirmed by his spokesman a day or so later,” he said. \nReports of the Turnbull-Trump conversation came as the US and Mexican governments were denying claims that the former reality TV star had threatened to send troops into Mexico to deal with drug cartels. \nMexican journalist Dolia Estevez, citing “confidential” US and Mexican sources, said Trump made the threat during an hour-long phone call with President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday. \nMexican and White House officials vehemently denied the report. \nRelations have plunged into the biggest diplomatic crisis between the two neighbors in decades. \nTrump angered Mexicans last week by ordering the construction of a massive border wall and vowing to make their country pay for the wall. \nPena Nieto has pledged that his government will never pay for the barrier and canceled a meeting with Trump scheduled for this week in Washington. \nIn addition to the row over the wall, Trump wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. Mexican officials expect talks to begin in May. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T21:39:01.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
