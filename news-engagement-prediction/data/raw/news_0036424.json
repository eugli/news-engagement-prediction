(Nathan Papes/The Springfield News-Leader via AP) \nJEFFERSON CITY • Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens is headed back to Washington. \nGreitens told the Pathway, a bi-weekly publication put out by the Missouri Baptist Convention, that he plans to meet with President Donald Trump next week. \nAmong potential discussion topics? The defunding of Planned Parenthood, a longtime priority for Missouri Republicans. \nOn Thursday, the U.S. House voted to repeal a rule imposed by the Barack Obama administration that prohibits states from denying funding to clinics for any reason beyond their ability to provide basic family planning services. It’s now headed to the U.S. Senate. \nShould the resolution succeed, it would be easier for states to deny federal family-planning funds to abortion providers, such as Planned Parenthood. \nIn his conversation with the Pathway, Greitens said he supported that effort. \nHe also said he would lead the fight against changes to the St. Louis anti-discrimination ordinance, which took effect this week and bans employers and landlords from discriminating against women who have had an abortion, use contraceptives or are pregnant. \n“We must protect people of faith and we must protect the unborn,” Greitens said. “We must win this and I am proud to lead the fight on this issue.” \nA spokesman for Greitens could not be reached for comment on meeting with Trump or his opposition to the bill updating the city’s ordinance. A spokeswoman for the White House also declined to comment on a meeting at this time. \nState lawmakers are considering legislation that would effectively block the updates to the ordinance on the grounds that it inhibits the free speech and religious rights of alternatives-to-abortion agencies, which counsel women against seeking abortions. \nGreitens recommended more than $6 million in funding for those agencies — sometimes called “pregnancy resource centers” — in his 2018 budget proposal. \nGreitens, a political outsider holding his first elective office, has already visited the nation’s capital twice since becoming Missouri’s chief executive. \nGreitens attended Trump’s inauguration. On another trip in January, he met with Vice President Mike Pence to discuss repealing the Affordable Care Act. Greitens also mingled at the Alfalfa Club dinner, an annual event typically attended by Washington’s elite. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
