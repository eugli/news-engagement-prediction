It took her two hours just to clear up the initial mess, and five days later, she's still finding feathers She then walked into her living room and found a very sheepish looking Yogi, who is one, sitting on the chair, aware he had done something wrong The bartender shared the video on Facebook with the comment: 'So my dog got hold of a feather cushion today #texaschickenmassacre.' She explained that the cushion, the size of a sofa seat, had been left in her room after she took the cover off to wash it, and she didn't realise she hadn't shut the door properly.

'The poor bear had survived 20 years, with four cats, two dogs. It's now sat in a bag waiting to be taken to a toy maker to be repaired!' The bartender guessed that there could be as many as 10,000 feathers covering her house and it took two hours to pick up the main heaps by hand so as not to block the hoover. She said: 'We are still finding them now.'
