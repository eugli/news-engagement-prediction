No one to say ‘This is wrong, this is right.’ No jobs. I had friends but no one to give me advice,” Hussein, who also claimed to have executed about 500 people since joining ISIS in 2013, told Reuters.\n“We shot whoever we needed to shoot and beheaded whoever we needed to beheaded,” declared the terrorist, who has been held captive by the Iraqi Kurds since October.\n Jihad , Middle East , National Security , Daesh , Iraq , IS , ISIL , ISIS , Islamic State , Yazidis , Yezidis", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fnational-security%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fislamic-state-jihadist-admits-raping-200-plus-iraqi-minority-women-saying-normal%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Islamic+State+Jihadist+Says+He+Raped+over+200+Iraqi+Women%3A+%E2%80%98This+Is+Normal%E2%80%99", "https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/02/20/iraq-sunni-women-tell-isis-detention-torture", "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-mosul-prisoners-idUSKBN15W1N0", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fnational-security%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fislamic-state-jihadist-admits-raping-200-plus-iraqi-minority-women-saying-normal%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Islamic+State+Jihadist+Says+He+Raped+over+200+Iraqi+Women%3A+%E2%80%98This+Is+Normal%E2%80%99", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fnational-security%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Fislamic-state-jihadist-admits-raping-200-plus-iraqi-minority-women-saying-normal%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Islamic+State+Jihadist+Says+He+Raped+over+200+Iraqi+Women%3A+%E2%80%98This+Is+Normal%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly"], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:09:31.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
