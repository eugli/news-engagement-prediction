Rodriguez The news that George and Amal Clooney are expecting twins broke nearly two weeks ago. It was confirmed by Julie Chen on The Talk , as well as by Clooney’s close friend Matt Damon . We hadn’t yet heard from either of the Clooneys themselves, though, until a new interview George Clooney did with Laurent Weil on Rencontres de Cinema . Clooney, who will be 56 in May, is entering fatherhood a little later in life, but he told Weil that he and Amal have greeted the news with joy. “Look, it’s exciting,” Clooney said (via People ). “And we’re really happy and really excited, and it’s going to be an adventure. We’ve sort of embraced it all . . . with arms wide open.” Clooney said his friends, whose grown children have all headed to college, were there to lend their best fatherly advice, but they couldn’t help but have a laugh at his expense. “It’s a table of eight guys . . . and we’re sitting there, and they’re all being great, very supportive: ‘It’s gonna be great; you’re gonna love it,’” he described. “And then they got really quiet, and they all started making baby crying noises.” Damon, too, found the humor in his friend’s new journey as a parent—especially when Clooney told Damon the news about four weeks before doctors advise new parents to share that they are expecting. But Damon also got serious about the type of parents the Clooneys will be. “[Amal’s] amazing,” he said on the Today Show . “He hit the jackpot. Just on every level. She is a remarkable woman. They’re gonna be great. They’re gonna be awesome parents. Those kids are lucky.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:11:42.824+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
