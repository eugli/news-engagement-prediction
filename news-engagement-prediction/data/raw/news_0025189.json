Ha! \nStill, others like Kal Penn and Justin Long were quick to point out that Drumpf happened to send out the tweet during his daily Intelligence Briefing! Ridic!!! \nHe's supposed to be paying attention to what his advisers are telling him about the country, not worrying about his grown child! \nJesus Effing Christ.
