When she got divorced in 2012, she left home to work in Batam.\n\"After she went to Batam, we hardly saw her. The last time she returned home was during Chinese New Year last month. She said then that she was working as a salesperson.\n\"We are indeed surprised that she had gone to Malaysia,\" Asria said when met at his home in Kampung Rancasumur, Sindangsari Pabuaran, here.\nSerang is the capital city of Banten province in the westernmost part of Java Island.\nSiti Aisyah is the youngest of three siblings. Her two brothers work as labourers and their parents eke out a living selling potatoes and turmeric.\nAsria said the family members learned of Siti Aisyah's arrest from her in-laws last Thursday, but had no other information since and no visits by any authorities until recently.\n\"Two days ago, a foreign ministry representative came and confirmed that my daughter had been arrested in Malaysia, but we were not told what happened,\" he said.\nAsria spoke highly of Siti Aisyah, saying she was an active child who made her parents proud as she was self-reliant and did not brood over the hardship she experienced.\n\"Despite being poor, Siti Aisyah is a hardworking and friendly girl, but never naughty,\" he said.\nAsria expressed a desire to meet his daughter.\n\"We can only cry thinking about the fate of our youngest daughter,\" he lamented.\nMalaysian police have so far arrested Siti Aisyah, another woman who carried a Vietnamese passport with the name Doan Thi Huong, a Malaysian man said to be Siti Aisyah's boyfriend and a North Korean man. â€“ Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:33:36.111+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
