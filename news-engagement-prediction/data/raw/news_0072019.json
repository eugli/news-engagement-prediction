Most Popular By Kyle Mizokami Feb 22, 2017 Harry Harris, the admiral in charge of American forces in the Asia-Pacific, wants to see the U.S. Army sink ships. That's according to U.S. Naval Institute News , which covered the admiral's appearance during a San Diego conference on seapower. During a speech at WEST 2017 , Admiral Harris said he told his Army subordinate at Pacific Command he would like to see \"Army land forces conduct an exercise to sink a ship.\" The Army currently does not have an anti-ship missile, and Army howitzers and rocket launchers are, for now, anyway, incapable of striking moving targets at sea. Meanwhile, here's Japan's Ground Self Defense Forces demonstrating their Type 12 anti-ship missile system to the public:   Most Popular So the Army would need a whole new capability to sink enemy ships. This would likely come in the form of land-based anti-ship missiles, and candidates include the Boeing Harpoon Block II+ , the latest version of the venerable Harpoon anti-ship missile, a new anti-ship variant of the Tomahawk cruise missile , Raytheon's Joint Strike Missile , and Lockheed Martin's Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile . Why does Admiral Harris want this? In any future conflict at sea, Army anti-ship missiles could help fill the gaps in America's defenses, creating no-go zones for enemy navies. Giving islands a self-defense capability would free up the Navy from having to defend them, allowing that branch to concentrate on taking the fight to the enemy.

HIMARS incorporates six 227-millimeter rockets on an Army Medium Tactical Vehicle (basically, a heavy truck). HIMARS fits inside most fixed-wing cargo transports such as the C-130 Hercules , meaning it can be taken to remote islands with short, unimproved airstrips. Instead of rockets, the new anti-ship missile system might carry four to six missiles. A separate vehicle would carry radar-equipped unmanned aerial vehicles that would loiter overhead searching for enemy ships, spotting targets at a greater range than land-based radars. Once located, the UAVs would provide targeting data for the missiles. The proposal to give the Army anti-ship missiles goes back to the days of the Army Coastal Artillery Corps. Active between 1901 and 1950, the Coastal Artillery Corps protected the United States from invasion via a vast network of fortified artillery outposts that protected both coastlines, Hawaii, and the Panama Canal Zone. The advent of nuclear weapons and the threat of nuclear bombers and missiles shifted the threat to the continental U.S. to the air, and the Coastal Artillery Corps was disbanded.

On one hand, it allows the Army to be operationally relevant in the Pacific where there are not a lot of places for land battles. On the other hand, establishing new Coastal Artillery units would siphon off money and personnel away from the Army's core mission of fighting battles on land. The Army just established six Security Assistance Brigades focused on counterinsurgency and only three of its 58 combat brigades are ready to fight . Army leaders may not be eager to spread the service even thinner than it is now. Sign up for the Popular Mechanics Newsletter Please enter a valid email address. Sign Up Thank You!
