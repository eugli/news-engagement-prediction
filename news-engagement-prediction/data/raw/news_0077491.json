No funding until proposal submitted \nThe project has been dismissed by WA Labor, which has promised to immediately axe Roe 8 and Roe 9, scrapping the Perth Freight Link if it wins office two weeks from now and instead building its flagship Metronet rail project.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:50:09.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
