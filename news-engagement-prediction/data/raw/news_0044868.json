I have a friend, who is definitely a real person and not me, who diligently prepared for the event by asking a trusted accomplice to act out this ritual with him as practice—a dialogue, incidentally, that elicits some very strange looks from fellow coffee shop patrons. EDITOR’S PICK We Just Witnessed the Goddamn Red Wedding of The Bachelor \nThe good part about this conversation is that no matter how nervous you might feel in the moment, it usually ends well, and Lord willing, you only have to do it once. However, this task is complicated considerably for The Bachelor 's Nick Viall, who gets only one opportunity before the show's finale—the contestants'\"hometown dates\"—to meet his potential in-laws face-to-face. Your last headliner, Ben Higgins, dealt with this wrinkle by waiting until the finale to call Lauren's parents and ask for their blessing. Yet Nick, for reasons known only to him and his maker, chose to pop the pre-pop-the-question question to all of his suitors' parents during Monday night's episode. \nYou won't believe this, but this strategy did not go over well. Here's how each of his asks went. Raven: 4/10 \nAfter a long day with Raven spent racing four-wheelers through a swamp—Arkansas looks awesome, by the way—Nick sat down with her father for the first of his ill-fated heart-to-hearts. \nNICK One thing I did want to ask you, run by you—if Raven and I get to the end and we realize that we're two people who can't say goodbye to each other, and in fact we want to go a step further and get engaged, are you comfortable with that? Is that you okay with you, as long as your daughter is okay with it? \nNick, for God's sake, each set of parents is still reeling from the revelation that their daughter, who they haven't seen in six weeks, desperately wants to marry a reality TV star. Maybe don't make it worse by posing this question as a hypothetical! \nRAVEN'S DOPE-AS-HELL DAD: I'm gonna be probably real frank. I didn't expect—don't take this wrong—but I didn't expect to like you. \nRest assured that no one in America faults you for that right now, sir. \nDAD: I have enough faith in her judgment that—I could live with that. That would satisfy me. \nThis is the grimmest possible \"yes\" in the history of this question. Rachel: N/A \nRachel's father, citing work obligations, did not make an appearance during the episode. Yet despite logging some quality time with Mom during the visit, Nick neglected to pose his question to her. (Pro tip, guys: When it comes time, ask both her parents. Leaving Mom out of the loop in the service of outdated gender roles is a very bad way to kick off your relationship with your in-laws.) Yes, it's possible that that Nick met with Judge Lindsay off-screen, but it's also possible that Nick did ask Rachel's mom, and it went so poorly that ABC didn't show it. Neither result is great, obviously. Seriously, can Rachel's The Bachelorette season start yet ? Corinne: 8/10 \nThis was Nick's best attempt of the bunch, which makes sense because he already had a dress rehearsal with another woman's parents, and also because he and Corinne deserve each other. \nNICK: I just want to let you know how much I respect your daughter. I feel very fortunate to have gotten to know her and develop some very serious feelings for her. If I'm lucky enough to have this all end with someone that I'm deeply in love with—and if your daughter and I get to the end and we as a couple decided to get engaged—you would be okay with it? \nDAD: If you can say to yourself, \"I can be happy with Corinne for the rest of my life, and this is the girl I want to offer a ring to, and I know Corinne would be equally as happy,\" that's good enough for me. \nNick thanked him, and Papa Corinne made a too-loud joke about them sharing good Scotch together, and they both immediately downed what remained in their glasses as if the producers had promised to mercifully end the scene once they finished their drinks. Good job, I guess. Vanessa: -3/10, oh God please make it stop \nThis one hurt. \nNICK: I respect your daughter immensely. \nNO-NONSENSE DAD: But you also went to the three other women— \nNICK: Absolutely. There's no denying that. \nThis is the exact point at which Nick should have thrown on the brakes, thanked Dad for his time, and expressed hope that they would talk again soon. Alas, he plunged ahead. \nNICK: If it gets to that point—if Vanessa and I, two adults who are madly in love with each other—decide that we want to take that leap of faith and get engaged, would I have your blessing? Would you be okay with that, if she was happy and she believed it was the right decision to get engaged? \nDon't do this. \nDAD: I just can't give you my blessing, just like this. \nNICK, SHIFTING NERVOUSLY: Um, is there—I respect that. \nDAD: You have three other women and you went to their homes. Did you ask their blessing also? \nNICK, STARTING TO SWEAT: Um, in a way, I ran it by them. \nDAD: What do you mean, \"ran it by them\"? It's yes or no. \nNICK, FRANTICALLY SIGNALING FOR THE EXTRACTION TEAM: Um, in a way, yeah. \nDAD: Well, the same question you asked me— \nNICK, ACTIVELY WISHING FOR DEATH: It was similar, yes. \nDAD: So, you did. \nNICK, WHOLLY DEFEATED: Yeah. \nThis was a devastating sequence, but Dad wasn't done, asking a perfectly reasonable question to which a fully-shook Nick could only respond with vintage Cady Heron word-vomit. \nDAD: So you're telling me you want to get engaged to my daughter. You're asking for my blessing, but what does that mean? When you ask somebody—when you're going to have kids of your own, and you have a daughter, and somebody comes and asks for your blessing, what does that mean to you? I just want you to be honest. \nNICK: I would like to think that means that I would feel comfortable with the young man to make that commitment and honor his commitment to my daughter, that he would respect my daughter and give her the life that I would want for her. I think the most honest thing I can say to you about this very unique and weird situation is that I will never make a decision with your daughter, especially if it's to want to be with her for life, if I don't think it's right. So I want you to know that I do respect your daughter that much, that I wouldn't do that. This is real life for me, and I very much care about your daughter. She makes me very happy. \nShockingly, this was good enough for Vanessa's father, who at that point grumpily agreed to give Nick his blessing, or at least gave up after a horrified team of producers begged him to say yes for the sake of the season's plot. \nStill, for gamely resisting the assumption that he should bless the hypothetical marriage of his daughter and a semi-employed Instagram personality she met on a reality television show, Vanessa's dad wins the inaugural GQ Best Bachelor Dad Award hands-down. His prize is, hopefully, not having to endure this again.
