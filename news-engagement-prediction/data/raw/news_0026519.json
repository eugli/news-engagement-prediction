After all, Democrats know that immigrants tend to vote for the political party they believe helped them enter our country. View Cartoon \nTexas, for example, is a hotbed for illegal immigration, since so many migrants enter the U.S. by slipping from Mexico into the Lone Star State. This month, USCIS used taxpayer resources to place a notice in the largest newspaper in San Antonio: \n“Those in need of emergency immigrations services can contact USCIS at 1-800-375-5283.” \nCorrection: undocumented immigrants are not in an emergency simply because they chose to break U.S. law. If I enter Mexico without proper papers, I’m not in an emergency. I’m a trespasser. \nIf anyone is in an emergency, it’s the American citizens being forced to subsidize the housing, career counseling, medical care, English classes, and now even the votes of illegal immigrants . Especially when migrant pools include migrants from terror hotbeds like Syria and criminals like those who killed Millennials Sarah Root and Kate Steinle. \nIn August, Obama’s 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals claimed that Texas’ voting rules were “discriminatory”—just in time to give Hillary a boost in a state that historically leans Republican. \nIt’s now easier for an immigrant to vote in Texas than to get into a bar for a pint of Guinness. All she needs to do is proffer a paycheck or utility bill and sign an oath claiming an “undue burden.” Obviously, utility bills and paychecks can be obtained (or forged) without being a citizen and anyone can claim an undue burden. \nIt’s (Not) For the Children \n“I am not going to slam the door on women and children,” Hillary sniffed during last week’s presidential debate against Donald Trump. \nNo, she’s not. Primarily because the average Syrian or Iraqi refugee— according to the United Nations —is male . \nSo when Hillary says she plans to exceed Obama’s record of accepting 10,000 Syrian refugees by about 550% to 65,000, she’s not speaking as an advocate for homeless mothers and children. She’s speaking as a politician who knows that just one year after the United States grants a refugee “asylum,” they may seek “permanent residency” status and five years after receiving asylum they may apply for U.S. citizenship. \nLoose immigration policies enable the trafficking of humans, drugs, weapons, diseases and terror into our country—and show disrespect to immigrants who do abide by our laws. Democrats don’t seem to care. After all, a 2014 study by the Center for Immigration Studies revealed that immigration has reconstructed “the nation’s electorate in favor of the Democratic Party.” \nPresident Sends Sheriff to Prison \nLess than one month before the presidential election, the Obama administration’s Department of Justice announced criminal proceedings against Arizona’s Sheriff Joe Arpaio without criminal charges . Arpaio is a popular sheriff who has served six terms in Maricopa County. He now faces up to six months in prison for using “immigration patrols” that were supposedly discriminatory. \nItalian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi at his side for moral support, President Obama held a Rose Garden press conference last week where he laughed off Donald Trump’s allegations of voter fraud and scoffed at the prospect of a “rigged election.” \n“Bridges, not walls!” Renzi chirped in agreement—like a doll programed to blurt Pope Francis’ worst catchphrases. ( Vogue recently did a story on Renzi, revealing his obsession with snapping selfies; monitoring his Twitter and Facebook followings; and keeping a stuffed owl in his office to remind him of his enemies. Confidence is not Renzi’s forte, which explains his willingness to be Obama’s yes-man). \nWhen a sitting president threatens a law-abiding sheriff with imprisonment for enforcing our country’s immigration laws without sound evidence—while illegal immigrants are awarded subsidized services enabling them to live and even vote like normal citizens—and—if such behavior escalates on the eve of a presidential election, then… \nTrump is right.
