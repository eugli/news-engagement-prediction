It's a precarious living. You can have an injury and never play again and I think people realise that now.\"\nStokes's aggressive style has been compared to that of Botham in his pomp and the former England captain said: \"I am very pleased for Ben. He is box office -- that's why he went for what he went for (in the IPL).\n\"His intention is not just to play, but to win, and that's the kind of guy he is.\n\"He is uncomplicated, what you see is what you get and he is a breath of fresh air, so I wish him all the best. And he is very loyal to Durham County Cricket Club.\"\nMeanwhile Botham said cash-strapped Durham would bounce back from last season's relegation to the second division of the County Championship, imposed because of their financial problems.\nDurham's sanction was agreed with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) on Monday as a condition of £3.8 million financial support from the governing body.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T12:56:57.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
