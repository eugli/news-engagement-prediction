She staggered backwards but managed to remain on her feet.” \nA passenger tried to intervene, but Wheelwright shouted at him: “Mind your own business you fat Australian c***.” \nHe then threatened to kill another member of the cabin crew. Flybe has announced new routes to Bournemouth and Bergerac \nMr Wilcock added: “The company has banned him for life from flying with them in the future. This is the first time such an order has been placed by this airline.” \nA victim impact statement from one of the crew, read out in court, said: “In 16 years I have dealt with drunken and disruptive passengers. What I experienced on this occasion was the first time I have ever been spoken to in this manner or been physically assaulted.” \nShe added that there would have been ‘devastating consequences’ if the plane was in the air at the time. \nWheelwright, of Whiston, Merseyside, pleaded guilty to one count of assault, one count of using threatening words or behaviour and one count of using racially aggravated threatening words or behaviour at an earlier magistrates’ court hearing.
