New champions \nThe shocks started early on Sunday night as Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson defeated Cesaro and Sheamus to claim the RAW Tag Team Championships on the Royal Rumble pre- show. \nJOIN THE DEBATE \nWere WWE right to have Gallows and Anderson win the titles?

Article continues below Kevin Nolan signs himself for Notts County \nCesaro and Sheamus had been expected to regain their titles in the match which saw two officials required to oversee the contest. \nHowever a report via RingsideNews has claimed that the decision to have the titles change hands was made very last minute. \nCesaro and Sheamus would both appear in the Royal Rumble match later that night and cracks would begin to show between the pair. \nThe decision to put the titles on Gallows and Anderson could signal the end of Cesaro and Sheamus' run as tag team partners. \nHowever with the new champions almost guaranteed to face the make shift duo in a title rematch, it will be interesting to see who they may end up squaring off against at WrestleMania 33. New challengers? \nGallows and Anderson do have a long history with former champions the New Day while they could also be set to move past Cesaro and Sheamus and look for new challengers. \nFan favourite tag team Enzo and Big Cass will certainly be amongst the top names to challenge the new champions. \nUtilising Enzo and Cass in a title match on the 'grandest stage of them all' would certainly be a way to increase interest for the show, but WrestleMania season is often full of surprises. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
