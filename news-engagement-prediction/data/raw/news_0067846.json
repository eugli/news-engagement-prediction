Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Katy Perry ended up abruptly walking out of a red carpet interview ahead of the BRIT Awards on Wednesday night.\nThe Roar star stopped to chat to Lilah Parsons and George Shelley on the red carpet at London's O2 Arena before she took to the stage to perform her new track.\nDuring the interview, Katy told the duo that she was excited about performing and also said she was taking \"pills\" to help her nerves\n\"It’s chapter two of what I did at the Grammys, I think. It’s the next kind of little storyline narrative and I’m feeling excited about it - very free.\"\nShe was then asked if she was nervous, replying: \"I take pills for that stuff! Hello! No… I have butterflies.\"\nBye then! George and Lilah were left looking a little bemused (Photo: Facebook/Brit Awards) (Photo: Facebook/Brit Awards) (Photo: Facebook/Brit Awards) Read More Mark Wright suffers embarrassing moment with Little Mix backstage at the BRITs Katy then started speaking about how much she wanted to see Ed Sheeran.\nAnd former Union J star George responded with: \"He's in there. Well, we won't keep you too long.\"\nClearly not that amused, Katy jokingly replied: \"Oh, alright. I'm leaving! Fine, I'll leave!\"\nTo make matters worse, she also eventually just ended up walking off as they tried to wrap things up a second time.\nKaty Perry The Brit Awards (Photo: Lia Toby/WENN.com) \"We're going to let you go. We can't keep you any longer,\" Lilah told her.\n\"You're going to let me go?\" Katy replied sarcastically. \"I'm firing you, I'm firing you.\"\nShe then handed her mic back to George and just walked off, leaving the X Factor star looking a little bemused.\nKaty Perry The Brit Awards (Photo: Rex Features) Meanwhile, later on in the night eyes ended up being fixed on the star's performance for all the wrong reasons when a backing dancer spectacularly fell off the stage.\nThe background performer, dressed as a house, stumbled off the stage as the Wide Awake hitmaker performed her new single, Chained to the Rhythm.\nThe blunder was quickly noticed on social media and the unfortunate dancer was dubbed the \"new left shark\" - a reference to Perry's 2015 Super Bowl performance when a backing dancer dressed as a shark fell spectacularly out of synch .\nKaty also lampooned Theresa May during her Brits performance as the Prime Minister was depicted as a skeleton holding hands with Donald Trump .\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in Katy Perry's backing dancer falls off stage Share this video Watch Next Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Celebs Newsletter Follow @mirrorceleb Subscribe to our Celebs newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Katy Perry George Shelley", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3696/4221396001_5333207994001_5333174573001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3064/4221396001_5333287160001_5333258914001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201611/1524/4221396001_5211853587001_5211836713001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove04.o.brightcove.com/4221396001/4221396001_4771741637001_winehouse-brit-THM.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201611/1334/4221396001_5202645638001_5202647970001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201611/695/4221396001_5198458435001_5198444806001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/4221396001/201507/629/4221396001_4383766526001_pez34.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove.vo.llnwd.net/v1/unsecured/media/4221396001/201509/480/4221396001_4472557750001_PERRY.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201602/1306/4221396001_4773309315001_4772985634001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1848/4221396001_5333250525001_5333234680001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=mirrorceleb", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3816/4221396001_5333225909001_5333228952001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1896/4221396001_5333194756001_5333175266001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/MirrorCeleb", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2080/4221396001_5333092150001_5333079823001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-23T03:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:34:56.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
