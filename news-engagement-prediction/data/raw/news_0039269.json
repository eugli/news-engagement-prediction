The Canadian crooner teamed up with rapper Nav for a new song, \"Some Way,\" and many fans think the collaboration disses Justin Bieber 's sex life with his ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez , who's now dating the \"Starboy\" singer. PHOTOS: Celebrity Feuds: The Biggest Ever! \nIn the explicit nearly three-minute track, which was released on Wednesday, February 15, The Weeknd boasts about pleasing an unnamed woman sexually and stealing her from her boyfriend. \"I think your girl, think your girl fell in love with me / She say my f--k and my tongue game a remedy,\" he sings. \nLater in the song, the two-time Grammy winner croons, \"I just took that chick and I know you feeling some way / She just want a n---a like me.\" PHOTOS: Celebs Fight Back on Twitter! \nThe beef between the musicians began shortly after The Weeknd, 26, and Gomez, 24, took their relationship public in January. Days after the new couple were photographed making out in Santa Monica, Bieber, 22, was asked by a paparazzo if he listens to The Weeknd's music. \"Hell no, I can't listen to a Weeknd song!
