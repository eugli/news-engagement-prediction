Comey reportedly refused to do so, because the FBI was actively investigating the matter.\nWhile not illegal, it is a breach of procedure for the White House to communicate directly with the FBI over an ongoing investigation. According to procedural memos from 2007 and 2009, contacts should be limited to the attorney general and deputy attorney general on the Justice Department side, and the president, vice president, counsel to the president or the principal deputy counsel on the White House side.\nPriebus himself vehemently denied contacts between the Trump team and Russians during an interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Feb. 19. “We don’t know of any contacts with Russian agents,” he said, calling the reports “total baloney.”\nDemocratic lawmakers, joined by a growing number of Republicans, have called for a Congressional investigation into charges that Russia intervened in the U.S. election, and many are asking for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a major supporter of Trump during the campaign, to recuse himself from the probe.\nMore from MarketWatch Trump Taps Gen.
