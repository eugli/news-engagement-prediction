She officially makes history as the only artist in Grammys history to sweep the Album, Record and Song of the Year twice. \nAdele, who brought the entire Staples Center to its feet after a stunning performance dedicated to late music icon George Michael , beat out Beyoncé ( Lemonade ), Drake ( Views ), Justin Bieber ( Purpose ) and Sturgill Simpson ( A Sailor's Guide to the Earth ). \nDuring her acceptance speech, the \"Hello\" songstress—looking gorgeous in the forest green-colored gown she rocked on the red carpet—opened up about motherhood and gushed about who else? Queen Bey. \n\"It took an army to make me strong and willing again to do it,\" Adele shared, breaking down in tears. \"Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. Five years ago when I was last here, I also was pregnant and I didn't know and I was awarded that shortly after... In my pregnancy and through becoming a mother I lost apart of myself. I struggled, and I still do struggle being a mom. It's really hard.\"   \nAdele called the unforgettable win a \"full circle\" moment, adding that a \"bit of me has come back to myself.\" \nShe also thanked the \"artist of her life,\" Beyoncé, who also started crying while watching from the front row. \"The Lemonade album was so monumental and so well thought out and so beautiful and soul baring,\" she explained. \"We got to see a side of you that you don't always let us see.\" \n25 skyrocketed to the top of the charts directly after its release in November 2015. Music critics praised the album, which went on to sell 8.03 million copies \nAdele leaves the 59th Annual Grammy Awards with all five of the awards she was nominated for—Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Pop Solo Performance and Best Pop Vocal Album. \nHere's to a night Adele won't soon forget!
