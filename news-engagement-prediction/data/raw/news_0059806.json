The Florida Strawberry Festival, of course! The festival celebrates the area's biggest crop and typically includes all things strawberry — from vendors offering everything from berry-themed crafts to flats of the red fruit. \nThey don't call it the \"Winter Strawberry Capital of the World\" for nothing — because there's nothing like Plant City's strawberries! You won't be able to resist all the tasty treats and delicious delights prepared with mouth-watering fresh strawberries. And, you can even test your limit in the strawberry shortcake eating contest! History \nThe Florida Strawberry Festival was born in the 1930s when the newly organized Plant City Lions Club had the idea to unite communities through the celebration of the strawberry harvest. The Lions Club and other civic organizations have participated in the festival throughout its long history. The American Legion Post #26 is also recognized for its effort in getting the Florida Strawberry Festival reactivated in 1948 following a six year hiatus during and immediately following World War II. Now \"The Florida Strawberry Festival Association\" is governed by a board of directors from the local community and a small staff who work year round to make the Strawberry Festival one of the top 30 of such events in North America. The Festival \nThis family-oriented event features arts, crafts, horticulture, livestock, agriculture, fine arts, rides, entertainment and so much more. Here are just a few of the highlights: \nThe Mighty Bluegrass Show's Carnival features over 60 thrilling rides in the Midway. Younger festival-goers will get their own thrills in the Strawberry Patch Kiddy Corral . \nMany showcase their talents in art and photography, while school children display shoe box floats that they've constructed. Even the wee ones get involved in the very popular baby contests where prizes are awarded in such categories as best decorated diaper and the diaper derby. \nThe agricultural shows and exhibits are a great way for children to learn how farming communities function. Some children get to see animals they've only seen in books, so it is a great educational experience too. Entertainment \nPerhaps almost as famous as its strawberries, is the Florida Strawberry Festival's entertainment line-up. Year after year, the Festival draws some of the finest rock and country music performers for its toe-tappin' concerts. The 2017 lineup will be announced at a later date. \nOf course, there is plenty of free entertainment at various stages throughout the fair property. Also, at 10:30 a.m. each day there will be a free concert. Information \nIf you go, expect a lot of traffic, especially on the weekends and plan your travel accordingly. \nThe 2017 Florida Strawberry Festival will be held March 2 thru 12. Advance admission and concert tickets will go on sale in early December, 2016. \nGeneral advance admission ticket prices are $10 for adults (ages 13+) and $5 for children (ages 6-12).
