It is not known if they were wearing some sort of thin gloves or if washing their hands quickly removed the danger. \nPolice had said earlier that the two attackers rubbed a liquid on Kim's face before walking away and quickly washing their hands. He sought help from airport staff but died before he reached the hospital. \nNorth Korea's official, state-controlled media mentioned the case for the first time on Thursday, saying Malaysia's investigation was full of \"holes and contradictions\" without acknowledging the victim was Kim Jong-nam. \nThe report from KCNA largely echoed past comments by North Korea's ambassador to Malaysia, but the publication of at least some news inside North Korea could be a sign of its concern over growing international speculation that Pyongyang dispatched a hit squad to kill Kim. \nLong estranged from North Korea's leadership, Kim Jong-nam had lived outside the country for years, staying in Macau, Singapore and Malaysia. \nThe two suspected attackers, and Indonesian woman and a Vietnamese woman, are in custody.
