I couldn’t be more proud of him.” \nFreshman guard De'Aaron Fox added 13 points and freshman guard Malik Monk scored 11, keeping his streak alive of scoring in double figures in every game this season. \nDespite the victory, Kentucky’s fifth in a row, Calipari still is not pleased with his team with only three regular season games remaining. \n\"We had guys playing scared,” Calipari said. “If you're afraid of Missouri, how are you going to play in that (NCAA) tournament? Guys not playing consistent. Defensively, having some breakdowns. But we won, we move on. But we've got work to do with this team.” \nMissouri (7-20, 2-13) was led by sophomore guard Terrence Phillips , who finished with a career-best 22 points. Junior forward Jordan Barnett added 13. \nKentucky shot 46.2 percent from the field and Missouri 36.7. The Wildcats outrebounded the Tigers 44-31, including 26-12 in the second half, but committed 17 turnovers. \nThe loss was the 20th for Missouri, it’s third straight years with 20 or more losses for embattled coach Kim Anderson . \n“For a team to be struggling win-loss wise, I just watched them fight like crazy,” Calipari said of Missouri. “I’m going to say it again: That is coaching. They haven’t let go of the rope here. I loved it when the students cheered Kim when he walked in. That means something to me. They had a chance to beat us. They could easily beat us.” \nAnderson appreciated the support. \n\"There’s nobody in America who’s more supportive of coaches than John Calipari ,” Anderson said. \nWith 7:45 remaining and the score tied 52-52, Kentucky ripped off an 8-0 run to lead 60-52. Adebayo scored the first five points and Wenyen Gabriel had the last three. Kentucky stretched the run to 16-6 to build its first double-digit lead of 68-58 with 1:43 to play. \nThe first half looked like anything like a game between one team with two SEC losses and another with only two conference wins. \nMissouri used a 7-0 run to grab a 28-24 lead with 4:20 left. Phillips had a 3-pointer and Reed Nikko and Barnett each scored two points. Kentucky had gone more than five minutes with just one basket during that stretch and had eight turnovers for the half. \nThe Wildcats bounced back to claim a 31-30 at halftime despite missing seven of its last eight shots from the floor before intermission. Isaiah Briscoe and Monk topped Kentucky with seven points each in the first half. Fox added six and Adebayo had five.

Missouri got nine points from Barnett and Phillips in the opening half. The Tigers shot 41.9 percent from the field but had six turnovers and two assists.
