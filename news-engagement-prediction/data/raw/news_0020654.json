The deliveries were going to Syria through organizations identified as ‘Medizin mit Herz’ (Medicine of Heart) and ‘Medizin ohne Grenzen’ (Medicine without Borders). \nThe Prosecutor's Office refused to disclose further details of the operation citing “the ongoing investigation,” but added it ordered the NRW criminal police to carry on with the inquiry. \nThough further details of the searches were not immediately available, the investigation comes on the heels of the German government’s efforts to foil lone-wolf terrorists and underground Islamist networks. \nFollowing the Christmas market attack in Berlin that resulted in 12 fatalities and revealed remarkable security gaps, German police and intelligence agencies have intensified the pace and scale of the anti-terrorism operation. The suspect, Tunisian national Anis Amri, pledged allegiance to Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) in a video message that emerged online after the attack. \nLast Wednesday, around 1,100 police officers conducted surprise raids on 54 flats, mosques, and industrial facilities in several cities, including Frankfurt, Offenbach, and Darmstadt, nabbing 16 terrorist suspects on Wednesday, including a recruiter and human trafficker linked to IS. \nThe operation followed a separate night raid in Berlin in late-January that led to the detention of three suspects with alleged links to IS. All of the suspects were part of a “widespread Salafist network” said to have been planning a terror attack, according to the regional Interior Ministry.
