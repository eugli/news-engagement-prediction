As a video producer at Giant Bomb , a popular gaming website, he features in at least five hours of videos a week for the site, as well as on its podcast.\n“People have passed around gifs of us for as long as I’ve worked at Giant Bomb,” he told the Guardian. \nBut this is the first time he’s been turned into a widespread, pretty much mainstream, meme. \n“It’s certainly a first for me,” he said. \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nThe gif itself is taken from an episode of a Giant Bomb show called Unprofessional Fridays, which was filmed back in 2013 . Scanlon and his colleagues were watching their editor, Jeff Gerstmann, play a game called Starbound. The moment comes just as Gerstmann says: “I’ve been doing some farming with my hoe here ... ”\nScanlon doesn’t remember filming this particular video – it was more than three years ago after all – but it’s part and parcel of what the website does. “I think a lot of our effort in these videos is spent on getting each other to laugh, to provide things for other people to react to or riff off.\n“My reaction was, I think, part of that.”\nDrew Scanlon (@drewscanlon) I do public appearances, birthday parties, and bar mitzvahs.

But this month it sped into the 2017 meme calendar after a viral tweet about a biology class. The gif was eventually dubbed the “white guy blinking” meme and generally used as the punchline to a funny and relatable tweet.\nFans were diligent in letting Scanlon know about this new pocket of internet fame. \n“I first got messaged about that biology tweet – which is still my favourite – a few weeks ago. Since then, pretty much it has been non-stop.\n“A lot of people have said that it’s ‘relatable’ which is a bit weird because of course I am, I’m human!”\nHe also got a weird insight into the Twitter accounts which rip off popular tweets as their own. He said: “I saw that biology tweet so many times, on different accounts.”\na girls thoughts (@FemaIeIdeas) me: ill take a biology class, im smart enough for this just watch me\nteacher: cells\nme: pic.twitter.com/Jn98ivHi2u \nFebruary 7, 2017 As weird as internet fame can be, Scanlon is relaxed about the whole thing. \nHe said: “I like what memes can do for people. They’re such fun, throwaway things I see. These memes have been generally positive.\n\n“It’s a little scary because there’s always the danger someone could change it to something different.\n“It’s not like I’ve a say in what the internet does with a gif of my face. But I’m pleased to see people are enjoying it.”\nInternet blogposts  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:13:59.448+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
