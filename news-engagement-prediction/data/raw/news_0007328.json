I left work, took a taxi and went straight to the school. When I got there she wasn’t handcuffed. She was just sitting calmly as if nothing happened and everyone was just standing around looking at her.”\nAccording to her mother and Jones, the child has been greatly affected by this incident.\nThe mother said that her daughter has not admitted that the situation took place as she is trying to block it out.\n“She was exhibiting fear towards police,” she said. “A little bit after the incident we were driving and (the police) had someone pulled over and she said ‘mommy, mommy, drive slow, don’t look, don’t look, they’re going to arrest you.”\nPolice told CTV News Toronto that this was the third time they were called to the school to deal with this child in particular.\nAccording to the officers, they used their discretion to decide that handcuffing her was necessary to prevent her from harming others and herself.\n“In regards to the kicking and the punching and the violent actions, they had to restrain her to ensure everyone was safe,” Peel Regional Police said.\nThe mother has brought in the African-Canadian Legal Clinic to file numerous complaints against the school board and police, including human rights complaints.\nJones said that if she was not an African-Canadian child he does not believe this incident would have taken place.\nBoth the mother and her lawyer said that this behavior is a rarity for this young girl.\n“This type of behavior that the school described didn’t exist anywhere outside of the school, not at the Boys’ and Girls’ Club, not at church, not at home and not at the new school that she is attending right now,” Jones said.\nThe child’s mother said that she kept her daughter home for weeks after the incident took place.\nThe mother eventually decided to switch her daughter to a new school where she says she is doing very well.\nThe legal clinic said they are looking for an apology and further answers.\nPolice said they are still reviewing the incident.\nPhotos A six-year-old girl was put in handcuffs by Peel Regional Police officers at her school in Mississauga. \nAn image of the school where a six-year-old girl was put in handcuffs by police in Mississauga is shown.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:44:53.575+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
