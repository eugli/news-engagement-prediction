(Courtesy Alex Parker) After more than 23 years at WJLA (Channel 7), most recently in the role of director of sports, Alex Parker is trying to figure out what’s next. Parker, whose position was eliminated in January as part of a series of cutbacks at the Sinclair Broadcast Group-owned station, has stayed busy and kept his skills sharp by field producing for a new Orioles fan blog: “Diamond Diaries — By: A Daughter (and her dad).”\n“I’m big with alliteration,” said Parker, who takes credit for the name of the site launched last month by his younger daughter, 11-year-old Nicole.\n“I really like writing and baseball,” said Nicole, a die-hard Orioles fan from Howard County who collects baseball cards, watches MLB Network and enjoys playing softball.\nOne of Nicole’s first posts was about Orioles FanFest, where she waited in line for an autograph of her favorite player, Manny Machado, at the Baltimore Convention Center on Jan. 28. She had no idea at the time that she’d soon come face-to-face with the Orioles’ third baseman again, in an entirely different setting.\nFree of any work responsibilities, Parker began looking into making a trip with Nicole to Sarasota for Orioles spring training, as fans. He emailed the Orioles to inquire about typical fan things, such as when players sign autographs, and happened to mention Nicole’s blog. Kristen Hudak, the Orioles’ director of public relations, asked Parker to send her a link to the site.\n“I send it to her, and she asks, ‘If you come down, would your daughter be interested in interviewing a player?'” said Parker, who hadn’t booked a flight yet. “Of course at that point, I called my wife and said, ‘Hon, we don’t have a choice. We’re going.’ I wouldn’t want to pass that up.”\nBirds Eye View: Our resident #orioles blogger taking in today's intra-squad scrimmage (noting they drag infield for these too.) #dreamday pic.twitter.com/f4ai6K1xb2 \n— Alex Parker (@ParkerSports) February 21, 2017 \n\nAnd so on Monday, with a notebook and iPad in tow, Nicole and her dad arrived in Sarasota. They were both given media credentials and left their hotel room early on Tuesday to head for the media room at Ed Smith Stadium. Nicole chatted with ESPN anchor Randy Scott , who was in town to shoot a feature with Orioles centerfielder Adam Jones. She interviewed Hudak and MLB.com Orioles reporter Brittany Ghiroli about their jobs, as well as Orioles pitchers Tyler Wilson and Oliver Drake.\n“I kind of like what Kristen does because you get to travel with the Orioles,” Nicole said. “It’s kind of cool that she knows all of the players. She was telling us about how nice they were.”\nWhen Mark Trumbo shattered his bat during batting practice later that morning, he walked over to the youngest reporter in camp and gave her both pieces. “Don’t hurt yourself,” he said.\nMark Trumbo broke his bat & spotted a VERY appreciative recipient.

She had practiced at home with her dad, but that could hardly prepare her for her final assignment of the day, an interview with Machado that later appeared on MLB.com .\n“I asked him, like I asked every player, how spring training was going and they all liked it,” she said. “I asked them what their least favorite part of spring training was and they all said the early mornings.”\n11-year-old Nicole Parker – an aspiring sportswriter – landed a pretty big interview at @Orioles camp: https://t.co/e8JKOoJeX0 pic.twitter.com/5gCua7oXl0 \n— MLB (@MLB) February 22, 2017 \n\nToday we welcomed reporter-in-training Nicole to interview O's players and learn about Spring Training operations. #OrangeSpring ⚾️🌴 pic.twitter.com/XONM2WJgTG \n— Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) February 21, 2017 \n\nParker, who started at WJLA during Redskins training camp in 1993, knows all about early mornings and late nights, working weekends and holidays and all the other times that sports happen. He said he considers Nicole a little version of him and his mom, Judy, who used to watch the Redskins and her favorite player Eddie LeBaron at Griffith Stadium and has come to love the Nationals. Parker would be delighted if Nicole pursued a career in sports journalism.\n“I’ve always said, and I’ll say it again when I get my next gig, that it beats working for a living, and for 23-and-a-half years rarely did what I did at ABC 7 feel like work,” Parker said. “It was like, ‘Are you kidding me? They’re paying me to do this?’ If she loves it, then sure. … She’s frankly inspired me. I should do something like this for me at some point because I like to tell stories. That’s part of what I did for a long time.”\nNicole, who thanked the Orioles’ PR staff with cupcakes on Wednesday before heading back north, certainly loved her first experience as a credentialed reporter. “I am so thankful that I had this opportunity and experience!” she wrote on her blog , which already includes a couple of posts about her time in Sarasota. “A huge thanks to Kristen Hudak and the Orioles for making this all possible!”\n\nNicole Parker thanked the Orioles with cupcakes.
