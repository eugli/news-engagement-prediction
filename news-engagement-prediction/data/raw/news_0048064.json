(Ricardo Ramirez Buxeda / Orlando Sentinel) (Ricardo Ramirez Buxeda / Orlando Sentinel) Tallahassee Bureau Privacy Policy \nTALLAHASSEE – Gov. Rick Scott harshly scolded fellow Republicans on a House budget panel Tuesday after they voted to cut tourism spending and eliminate Florida’s main economic development agency. \n“Today’s vote by politicians in the Florida House is a job killer,” Scott said in a released statement. “I know some politicians who have voted for this job killing bill say they don’t necessarily want to abolish these programs but instead want to advance a ‘conversation.’ This is completely hypocritical and the kind of games I came to Tallahassee to change. Perhaps if these politicians would listen to their constituents, instead of playing politics, they would understand how hurtful this legislation will be to Florida families.” \nThe bill, HB 7005, passed on a 18-12 vote, with just two Republicans, Reps. Holly Raschein of Key West and Bill Hager of Boca Raton, voting against it. It now heads to the House floor, increasing the stakes of an ongoing battle between Scott and House Speaker Richard Corcoran, R-Land O’Lakes. \nThe original version of the bill would have eliminated Visit Florida, the state’s public-private tourism marketing arm, but it was amended Tuesday to put the agency under strict transparency and accountability rules aimed at increasing oversight of spending and capping salaries for staffers. \nIt also funds Visit Florida at $25 million, bringing it lower than 2011 spending levels. Since then, Visit Florida’s funding as increased to $76 million. Tourism has increased from 86 million to 112 million in 2016. \nBut a secret $1 million contract with the rapper Pitbull to promote the state that was revealed last year after Corcoran threatened a lawsuit led the House to push for more transparency at the agency. \n“As the funds have risen the problems have arisen,” said Rep. Paul Renner, R-Palm Coast. “We’re putting them on a leash - a short leash.” \nTourism industry officials and small business owners from around the state packed the committee room to voice their opposition to the bill. Visit Florida helps them market their business around the world and rebound after natural disasters, and would see a decrease in visitors and customers if it were to lose funding. \n“We were able to get more visitors, more guests after (Hurricane Matthew),” said Tom Dolan, owner of Meehan’s Irish Pub in St. Augustine. “Please reconsider.” \nThe bill also gets rid of Enterprise Florida and a slew of economic development programs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:31:27.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
