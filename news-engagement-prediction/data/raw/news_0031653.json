Jarrett Bell , USA TODAY Sports 6:41   CLOSE x Share Six members of the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots have said they won't be making the customary trip to meet President Donald Trump at the White House. Time_Sports New England Patriots free safety Devin McCourty. (Photo: Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAfter assaulting the record book during their dramatic comeback in Super Bowl LI, the New England Patriots are not done yet with the matter of making history. \nThe next “record” poised to collapse under the weight of the dynasty: White House rejections. \nIn a postscript to the thriller that marked the fifth Super Bowl victory during the Bill Belichick-Tom Brady collaboration, six players from the NFL’s freshest champion have already declared they won’t join the upcoming party at the White House to celebrate with President Trump. \nHave six players from a Super Bowl winner ever skipped the trip to the ‘House? \nHardly. \nYet with the Patriots’ three most powerful figures – team owner Robert Kraft, Belichick and Brady – aligned in some form or fashion with the polarizing president this needs to happen. \nEspecially when Brady was a glaring no show – for reason he hasn’t explained publicly -- the last time the Patriots went to the White House and were hosted by President Obama. \nKraft likes to assert, “We are all Patriots!” amid the flow of accepting championship trophies. No problem with that. It’s an ideal sentiment that plays off his team’s nickname. \nLet’s hope that Kraft – a lifelong Democrat – implores Trump to maintain that spirit of inclusiveness during their social visits, like the dinner Friday at the President’s resort in Palm Beach, Fla. \nMORE COVERAGE: LeGarrette Blount adds name to growing list of Patriots who won't make trip to the White House \nIn the meantime, it’s refreshing to see that the “all Patriots” team includes some players with a conscious that illustrates a connection with so many people in the broader society. Trump may openly root for the Patriots and drop the names of Brady, Kraft and Belichick amid his political speeches, but at least there’s some resistance to the “Trump’s Team” narrative. \nLet’s call them the Initial Six: Martellus Bennett. Devin McCourty. Chris Long. LeGarrette Blount. Alan Branch. Dont’a Hightower. \nI’m guessing that by the time the yet-to-be-scheduled affair commences, the number of Patriot no-shows will grow. Super Bowl hero James White maintains he’s unsure if he’ll go, and will decide after the invite becomes official. \nWhat a statement game this is, capping the end of an NFL season that in keeping pace with the nation at large was in many ways, “The Year of the Protest.” \nWhile a couple of the players – Hightower and Branch – offered reasons for pulling out that were apolitical, the others left no illusions about their willingness to take a stand. Or a pass. \nMcCourty, a team captain who might be the most respected Patriot in the locker room outside of Brady, said he doesn’t feel accepted in the White House. It’s a shame the affairs this nation have become so polarized and the rhetoric so vile that a citizen would express that. \n“With the President having so many strong opinions and prejudices,” McCourty explained, “I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won’t.” \nBlount echoed McCourty’s sentiment about not feeling welcomed, while Bennett – the first Patriot to make his intentions known about skipping the White House -- urged people to follow him on Twitter and check out his tweets if they need more of an understanding of his view. \nHow fitting, given all the tweets that have come from Trump. \n“It is what it is,” Bennett told reporters after Super Bowl LI. “People know how I feel about it.” \nLong, meanwhile, didn’t mention Trump by name. But he tweeted that his decision had absolutely nothing to do with an open letter published to him that urged that he join African-Americans by skipping the White House. \nNo, Long, a ninth-year vet, doesn’t need suggestions from any of us. When protests by African-American players ramped up early in the season after Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem, Long offered a response that was largely missing – that he felt it was important for white players to speak out against societal injustice, too. \nThat he won’t go to the White House underscores that sentiment. \nNew England Patriots fan holds a sign referring to Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, head coach Bill Belichick and President Donald Trump during the first half of the AFC championship game with the Steelers. (Photo: Steven Senne, AP) \nBrady, meanwhile, refused to get political during Super Bowl week, telling me, “I have a right to stay out of it,” even though he once displayed a “Make America Great Again” cap in his locker – which has been interpreted by many as a statement in itself. \nThe first quarterback to win five Super Bowls may not owe the world an explanation about his political leanings. But in this climate, you’d think that Brady – who in the past has talked about his interest in following politics – would want to set the record straight about some of views. \nBrady’s had a friendship with Trump over many years. So has Kraft, who points to Trump’s support during an emotional crisis after his wife Myra died in 2011 as a foundation for their bond. \nYet given the issues and the actions by Trump that have sparked protests and various forms of resistance, Kraft by not distancing himself from the politics could have his position interpreted as tacit approval. \nSo Brady has a big opportunity in front of him, too – even if he visits the White House this time. \nIn the meantime, the Patriot Way rolls on as the records keep falling. \nPHOTOS: TOM BRADY THROUGH THE YEARS Facebook Posted!

They're two Lombardis shy of making Pats first to win seven. Matthew Emmons, USA TODAY Sports 2. Falcons (3): Defense couldn't get off field when it had to, and offense couldn't stay there. Will heartbreak drive young Falcons forward or ruin them? Bob Donnan, USA TODAY Sports 3. Packers (5): Aaron Rodgers says they need only reload. But Pack could lose a lot of bullets: Julius Peppers, T.J. Lang, Nick Perry, Jared Cook, Eddie Lacy. John David Mercer, USA TODAY Sports Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott (4) and quarterback Tony Romo (9) warmup before the game against the Baltimore Ravens at AT&T Stadium. Tim Heitman, Tim Heitman-USA TODAY Sports 5. Seahawks (7): Assuming Earl Thomas doesn't follow through on retirement musings, team returns basically intact ... though O-line upgrades still a must. Derick E. Hingle, USA TODAY Sports 6. Steelers (4): Just when defense looks ready to uphold Blitzburgh tradition, questions arise about Big Ben, Bell and Brown that will define offseason. Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports 7. Raiders (11): They seem to be poised to reclaim their position as a perennial power, assuming uncertain future doesn't become unmanageable distraction. Neville E. Guard, USA TODAY Sports 8. Chiefs (6): Andy Reid is standing behind QB Alex Smith heading into the 2017 season. The question being, is Reid's faith misplaced at this point? Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports 9. Dolphins (9): First-year coach Adam Gase lived up to his reputation, revitalizing an offense on the cusp of something special. Defense still needs help. Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports 10. Titans (13): Keep an eye on this bunch, which fell a tiebreaker shy of playoffs. Now they have two of the top 18 draft picks and loads of cap space. Trevor Ruszkowski, Trevor Ruszkowski-USA TODAY Spor 11. Giants (8): As much as they improved, imbalanced team's inability to run ball or stop pass was apparent in postseason. Maybe they were on \"cruise\" control. Jason Bridge, USA TODAY Sports 12. Broncos (14): New coach Vance Joseph arrives with much buzz, promises to sustain defensive dominance. But who's going to tutor the young QBs? Tony Romo? Isaiah J. Downing, USA TODAY Sports 13. Lions (10): Now that the smoke and mirrors have lifted, it's time to remember this team was outscored and outgained in 2016. Lots of work to be done. Kirby Lee, USA TODAY Sports 14. Texans (17): J.J. Watt is fully recuperated from back surgery. But how long will it take Brock Osweiler to recover from his car wreck of a season? Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports 15. Redskins (15): As they presumably prepare to break bank for Kirk Cousins, will they need overdraft protection to get him targets if Jackson, Garcon leave? Geoff Burke, USA TODAY Sports 16. Vikings (16): They have enough defense to host Super Bowl next year but ... whither Adrian Peterson? Whither Teddy Bridgewater (and maybe Sam Bradford)? Bruce Kluckhohn, USA TODAY Sports 17. Buccaneers (12): They're shedding some unfavorable contracts in a few weeks and will have cap space to again become an enticing free agent destination. Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports 18. Saints (19): Drew Brees will probably keep them competitive, but can New Orleans really expect to hang in this division if defense doesn't get makeover? Dale Zanine, USA TODAY Sports 19. Cardinals (22): Believing this season was an aberration, WR Larry Fitzgerald has decided to come back for the 2017 season. But who's throwing to him? Matt Kartozian, USA TODAY Sports 20. Colts (18): Already a hectic offseason with GM Ryan Grigson fired, P Pat McAfee retired and QB Andrew Luck under knife. Work cut out for Chris Ballard. Ed Mulholland, USA TODAY Sports 21. Ravens (21): If you think this team might be getting old, even with Steve Smith leaving, you're right. Fourteen players on roster are at least 30. Evan Habeeb, USA TODAY Sports 22. Panthers (20): One year after clearly being the top quarterback in NFC South, Cam Newton was most decidedly division's worst in 2016. Truth in middle? Bob Donnan, USA TODAY Sports 23. Bengals (23): CB Adam “Pacman” Jones used to be a positive beacon for a team that likes to issue second chances to at-risk players. But now? Sam Greene, USA TODAY Sports 24. Chargers (25): So they're going to build their new Los Angeles fan base by playing in front of 27,000 people at home for the next two years? R ght. Orlando Jorge Ramirez, USA TODAY Sports 25. Eagles (24): Carson Wentz's disturbing finish overshadowed his stellar start. His passer rating over his last dozen games was 72.3, and he went 4-8. Bill Streicher, USA TODAY Sports 26. Jaguars (26): Tom Coughlin had taken them to two AFC title games in five years after starting from Square 1. Team's new czar at least at Square 5 now. Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports 27. Rams (28): Big risk they're assuming by hiring Sean McVay could be substantially offset by coup of also hiring defensive coordinator Wade Phillips. Troy Wayrynen, USA TODAY Sports 28. Bills (29): First-year head coach, no apparent answer under center and a GM who doesn't seem totally plugged into what's going on. Seems encouraging. Kevin Hoffman, USA TODAY Sports 29. Bears (27): Poor Jordan Howard. Rookie finished second in NFL with 1,313 rushing yards but didn't get single ROY vote and about as much publicity. Mike Dinovo, USA TODAY Sports 30. Jets (30): Amazing to think a team this bad -- and with no quarterback carrying a megacontract -- finds itself needing to get under the salary cap. Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports 31. 49ers (31): The job is yours, Kyle Shanahan. After all that Super Bowl criticism, you can now fail to milk the clock, and no one will bat an eyelash. Kyle Terada, USA TODAY Sports 32. Browns (32): If your team had $100 million to spend in free agency and two first-round picks, you'd be excited. But Cleveland's fans know better.
