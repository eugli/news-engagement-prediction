Image caption Thirty of the 38 people killed by a gunman on a Tunisian beach were British \nThe inquest, which began in January at London's Royal Courts of Justice, has also heard evidence that: Tunisian security forces \"wasted time\" before responding to the attack Four unarmed guards manned the hotel where the attack took place, despite the resort being a known terror risk UK officials had been told of security concerns in Sousse six months before the attack, but decided against discouraging all travel to Tunisia TUI's website did not have any reference to a terror attack in Tunisia months earlier in March 2015 at the Bardo National Museum, where 22 people, including 20 tourists, were killed Some survivors \"played dead\" during the attack \nAndrew Ritchie, who is representing 20 victims' families, told the inquest they believed TUI's \"utter complacency\" amounted to neglect. \nHe said the guards at the Riu Imperial Marhaba had not been an effective deterrent and the lack of CCTV had made it a target. \nBut Howard Stevens, counsel for TUI, said even if there had been additional CCTV cameras or guards it \"cannot be said that any of these measures would probably have made a difference\". \nThe travel company maintained it was \"wholly erroneous\" to claim it had been neglectful and there was insufficient evidence of any gross failure.
