Well, parents at one nursery do – although apparently it happens elsewhere. \nBy 'forgetting', we mean they're paying their children little or no attention whatsoever while collecting them at nursery. Instead, they're plugged into their phones , probably obsessing over cat memes and pictures of Beyonce . \nA nursery in Houston, Texas, felt it necessary to tell parents off. Staff there penned a note telling mums and dads that their kids need them, want to show them their work and talk about their days, but are being ignored. \nThe notice was posted to Facebook by mum Juliana Mazukewicz. She feels it's \"relevant,\" and it probably is. The parental criticism has been shared more than 1,000,000 times. \nHundreds of other mums and dads agree. Susie Cox commented. She wanted to remind parents of the importance of listening to kids. \n\"This is so true listen to children and what they say to you - you miss things that they'll never say again and in the end they won't bother to tell you anything which can be dangerous as they go from child to adolescent you may miss something important -nothing on your phone can replace or supersede your children's chatter so listen!\" she fumed. \nMaria Campbell, who said she's worked in the childcare sector, said it's a real problem in modern times.

Unfortunately there is much truth to this statement. \n\"In this day and age with the hustle and bustle of people's schedules it is very difficult to get parents to sit down with their children and focus on doing homework with them and being attentive to what their children's needs are. \n\"I am not saying that all parents are this way but a handful of people are this way and it is very detrimental to a child's development when a parent can not show the child that there is a time and place for everything and that the person should be paying attention to the task at hand.\" Kid want to talk to their parents (Photo: Getty) Read More Beyonce's pregnancy snap is now most liked Instagram image ever – it's easy to see why \nSome called for phones to be banned in nurseries entirely. But not everyone agreed. \nAnd Ronald Killgo made a good point: \"I have seen this happen, but in all fairness parents were ignoring their kids long before cell phones. \n\"I grew up hearing 'Children should be seen and not heard', and always thought that was terrible.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T16:43:04.369+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
