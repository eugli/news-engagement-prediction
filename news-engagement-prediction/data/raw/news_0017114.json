The ban was said to have been because the pair, from Afghanistan, had put on diving goggles and been swimming underwater so that they could put their hands on the private parts of female swimmers. The two men had been taking it in turns to assault each of them German police spokesman Tom Litges At that time the management had decided not to press charges against them. Allowed to re-enter, the victims raised the alarm with the lifeguards, saying they had been stopped when they were using the giant slide and had been held so that they could be assaulted. One of the men had allegedly stopped himself halfway down so that he could grab the two girls and his friend then followed behind them so that they could pin their victims between the them for the sex attacks to take place. Police spokesman Tom Litges said: 'The girls travelled down the chute but were stopped halfway down by the first attacker, and were unable to go any further when suddenly the second attacker then came up behind them and the two men put their hands on the girls' breasts and bottoms. 'They said that the two men had been taking it in turns to assault each of them.' Police were called by the lifeguards and the two were arrested while still in the swimming pool. Two migrants were arrested on suspicion of molesting five girls in this pool in Bad Oldesloe AquaPark spokesman Alexander Hoefer said: 'We will not tolerate anything like this in our swimming pools, and we are filing a criminal complaint against the two men.' After problems last year the management had apparently installed 46 cameras in the swimming pool and car park, and the footage is now being studied following the girls allegations and the arrest of the two men. Meanwhile, two asylum seekers have been charged with molesting five girls between the ages of 12 to 14 at a second German swimming pool. A local police report from the Ratzeburg force states the suspects were two 'southern-looking' men who molested them under the water. The men are 23 and 34 years old and are said to be asylum seekers living in Bad Oldesloe in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein. The town centre of Bad Oldesloe, where the two men were said to be living as refugees The incident was reported to the lifeguards, according to the report , who kicked them out of the pool before calling the police. It is not the first problem at swimming pools in the area. Last year, a secret police document was leaked in Duesseldorf voicing the 'grave concern' of police chiefs about soaring sex crimes carried out by refugees at public swimming baths. A month later, the professional swimming association in Germany wanted to reduce escalating sex attacks by refugees at public baths by training migrants to become pool lifeguards. The Federal Association of German Swimming Professionals (BDS) said in July it would be 'an inclusive measure that would benefit everyone'. There were several reports of rape and other sex attacks committed against women and children at public pools both in Germany and neighbouring Austria last year. Many municipalities, including Munich, displayed charts in numerous languages aiming to teach migrants to respect women and children at the local pool. The men are 23 and 34 years old and living in Bad Oldesloe (pictutured) in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstei Across the border in Austria, the problem is also present. In October, an Iraqi refugee who raped a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool has had his conviction overturned because a court didn't prove he realised the boy was saying no. The rapist, identified as Amir A, 20, violently sexually assaulted the boy in the changing room of Theresienbad pool in Austria claiming it was a 'sexual emergency' because he had not had sex for four months. But an appeal court in the country accepted the defence lawyer's claim that the lower court had not done enough to prove he knew the schoolboy was saying no and overturned the conviction.
