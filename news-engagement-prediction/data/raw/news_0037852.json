There will be a bar session after the Q&A where Shkreli will be available to chat and take photographs. He WILL play tracks from his unreleased music collection (Wu-Tang and more). \nShkreli played clips from Once Upon a Time in Shaolin on a livestream the day after the election, but with poor audio quality. In November, Shkreli also threatened to release his own rap album, so it's possible he pulls a bait-and-switch and treats the audience to his music instead. The tickets range from $15-$50. \nAs of Wednesday, Webster Hall's calendar does not list the event.
