We'll take a decision at the end of the season, because my future is at stake.\" \nIsco became one of Spain's hottest prospects in his second season with Malaga as he inspired his local team's march to the quarter-finals of the 2012/13 Champions League. \nHe joined Real for a reported 30 million euros in July 2013, winning two Champions Leagues and the King's Cup. \nLast April his former coach at Malaga, Manuel Pellegrini, told Marca that Isco had been on the verge of joining him at City before he finally opted to move to the Spanish giants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:49:30.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
