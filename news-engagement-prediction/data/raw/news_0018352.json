The President sacked his interim Attorney General for failing to enforce his immigration ban, with the White House saying that she had \"betrayed\" the Justice Department. \nBut the most recent polling done on the policy shows that most Americans still back the policy. Trump executive order approval ratings \nP olling by Morning Consult and Politico reveals that the travel ban is, at the same time, one of Trump's most popular and most divisive \nA majority of people (55 per cent) approve of the controversial immigration ban , while just 38 per cent disapprove. \nAt the same time, the immigration order had the lowest proportion of people saying that they don't know what their opinion is, out of any of the executive orders signed by Trump. \nFurther signalling the divides in American society after a brutal presidential election, the support for Trump's policy is split heavily along partisan lines. Some four out of five Republicans support the order, while over three out of five Democrats oppose it.
