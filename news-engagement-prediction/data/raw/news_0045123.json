Used to be a Loyd Grossman, 'Now who'd live in a house like this...' 2pm kind of programme. \nLeigh Francis' alter ego Keith Lemon has reinvigorated it, however, making it more post-watershed and humorous. \nAnd this interview with former basketball star Dennis Rodman is absolutely classic. \nFrom not understanding what Keith is saying to taking an age to really explain what 'rebounding' means, it's bloody funny. \nTake a look at the pair of them here. Credit: ITV/Through The Keyhole \nFor the record, at the end of the clip Dennis is asked what his middle name is - it's Keith. \nRodman's basketball career saw him playing for the Detroit Spinners from 1986-93, then joining San Antonio Spurs, Chicago Bulls, LA Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks, among others after. He also went into the Celebrity Big Brother house in 2006, before joining Love Island the following year. Rodman leaving the Big Brother house.

He even explains that his girlfriend thought she had killed him there was so much blood the first time it happened. \nHe told Vice about each encounter. \nHe said: \"I was on a boat one time in Dallas, Texas, and was out in the sun all day long, drinking, drinking, partying, partying then I was out for the night drunk as a motherfucker.\" \n\"My girlfriend, we end up in the back of the boat in a big king sized bed. \n\"She loved sex and she said: 'I think I'm going to try something different, go over there, walk over there'.\" \nShe decided she was going to run and jump onto his manhood, and he complied. Then he heard a crunching sound. \nThen the blood gushed. According to him, she then started shouting: '\"Oh my God he's dead he's dead, I killed him oh my God'. \n\"I said 'no honey I broke my dick'.\" Perhaps a metaphor of some description? Credit: PA \nThe second time a lady called Tracey was giving him oral sex and it must have been pretty vigorous because the next thing, once more, there was blood everywhere. \nAnd the third (and hopefully last time), happened in New York, where, once it had happened, the doctor told him he had a contused penis, which, although I'm not exactly sure what that means, doesn't sound very good at all.
