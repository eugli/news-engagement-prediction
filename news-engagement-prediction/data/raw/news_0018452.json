The long list of enterprises looking to join the fight against Trump are among the country’s biggest, most high-profile businesses like Uber, eBay and Netflix. \n• ALSO READ: 2 States: Reinstating Trump Travel Ban Would ‘Unleash Chaos Again’ \nTrump’s order applied to Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen – countries the administration said raise terrorism concerns. The order sparked nationwide airport protests and caused confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the United States. \nTrump has said he’s trying to protect Americans. The government says the president has the authority to decide who can enter the country. \nHowever the companies, in their court filing, said Trump’s executive order would destroy the entrepreneurial spirit that fuels American businesses. \n“Immigrants make many of the nation’s greatest discoveries, and create some of the country’s most innovative and iconic companies,” the court filing said. “The experience and energy of people who come to our country to seek a better life for themselves and their children-to pursue the ‘American Dream’-are woven throughout the social, political, and economic fabric of the nation.” \n© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
