Philippine — Amid the steady drumbeat rooting for them to miss their shots, the PBA’s back-to-back-to-back MVP alongside its former one refused to let the San Miguel’s season fade away. On the brink of elimination, June Mar Fajardo and Arwind Santos took charge in the second half to carry their team. \nOn Saturday night at the Mall of Asia Arena, the Beermen protracted their bid to repeat as Philippine Cup champions, defeating the TNT KaTropa, 104-88, to force a sudden-death Game Seven. \nFajardo led the Beermen in scoring and rebounding, finishing with 23 points and 21 rebounds. Santos chimed in 21 markers and nine boards to help his team ignite a 13-point assault in the third period to upend the KaTropa. \nTNT managed to close in early in the payoff period, 73-75, and tried to build on it but were turned back by SMB’s Alex Cabagnot and Chris Ross. \n“Despite of a sup-bar first half … lahat sila gustong manalo,” said Beermen head coach Leo Austria. “Naka-focus sila eh. yung mga starters, ayaw magpalabas eh. Gustong manalo talaga.” \n“Nagaroon kasi kami ng momentum. We were down 10 in the third but the players did not give up,” he added. “[We ensured na] by the end-game, may one-fourth fuel pa sa tank namin.”   \nAustria also lauded Fajardo—the league’s current best player—and noted that he was “different” this time around. \n“Kahit ‘yung shots nila sa middle, china-challenge niya,” the mentor noted. \nBut “different” was far from it, as Fajardo again posted a massive double-double to extend his record and the league’s all-time best to 11. \nFajardo also currently leads this conference in the most double-doubles with 14. \nThe KaTropa will have another chance make it to their first PBA Finals since the 2014-2015 Commissioner’s Cup this coming Monday. \nThe scores: \nSAN MIGUEL 104 - Fajardo 23, Santos 21, Cabgnot 19, Ross 14, Garcia 9, Lassiter 7, Espinas 5, McCarthy 2, De Ocampo 2, Agovida 1, Tubid 1, Heruela 0, Reyes 0, Van Opstal 0. \nTNT 88 - Castro 19, Pogoy 12, Fonacier 12, Reyes 9, Williams 8, Rosales 7, Tautuaa 6, De Ocampo 5, Carey 3, Tamsi 3, Rosser 2, Seigle 2, Golla 0, Sumalinog 0. \nQuarterscores: 26-27, 45-53, 70-69, 104-88.
