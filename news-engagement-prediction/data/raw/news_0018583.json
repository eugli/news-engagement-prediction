And his performances aren't going unnoticed. \nThe Portuguese winger is on loan from Porto and attracting plenty of interest from Liverpool's Jurgen Klopp who hopes to secure his services in the summer, according to the Daily Star. \nAnd the club are making the necessary inroads to pull off the signing. Liverpool have reportedly made contact with the players representatives over a possible transfer. \nThe 23-year-old is currently plying his trade in France, and has compiled 83 appearances over two seasons while bagging three goals as Nice mount a challenge for the league title. \nPereira is enjoying a second year at the French outfit with his contract at Porto set to expire in 2019 who are prepared to listen to offers. \nIt's believed a £22 million bid will prize him away from Portugal though the Premier League side will have to fend off competition from Serie A side Inter Milan.
