I'm thankful for the opportunity, that other organizations were calling and still believe in my ability to play this game. I've got a spot at the table. Got a locker, got a jersey with my name, got a job. My sons can say, 'Dad's still a big leaguer.'\" \nâ€¢ Spring Training: Information | Tickets | Schedule | Gear \nRomo, who turns 34 next month, officially signed on Wednesday. As he surveys the free-agent market and sees some colleagues out of work, the former closer is willing to be a setup man for Kenley Jansen . \n\"Some guys are considering retiring,\" he said. \"Makes it easier for me to be appreciative. I know I signed late, but I feel lucky, very privileged.\" \nRomo spent nine seasons with Dave Righetti as his pitching coach in San Francisco, and said, \"It's pretty awesome having Rick Honeycutt as my coach. I grew up a Dodgers fan.\" \nIndeed, even in his first game at Dodger Stadium, Romo recalls leaving tickets for 30 family members, who all showed up in Dodgers gear. \n\"And here I am playing for the Giants,\" he said. \"It didn't really fly well. Now they can bring blue and white out of the closet and wear it with pride.\" Team Mexico ready for WBC 2017 Gonzalez, Romo to lead Mexico in WBC 2017 Adrian Gonzalez and Sergio Romo talk about Team Mexico's mindset in the 2017 World Baseball Classic under their manager, Edgar Gonzalez \nRomo talks about succeeding without being the \"biggest and baddest\" at 5-foot-11. He wears his pride on his sleeve, while acknowledging he plays for more than personal satisfaction or financial gain. For example, he can't wait to make another appearance with Team Mexico in the upcoming World Baseball Classic. \n\"For me it's super special, important,\" he said. \"I believe children are the best examples of their parents. I get to represent that I'm my father's son and my mother's son. They were the best examples I could ever hope for, they showed me what it's like to show respect, so people accept the type of people we are. \n\"To put on a jersey that says 'Mexico,' I know I'm born in the States, but the blood in my veins is Mexican. My morals, my upbringing, my customs, it's all Mexican. I get to show my appreciation for that. I'm happy to say I can give something back and represent what my dad stands for. I only hope it makes him feel good, and proud of me. It's awesome for me, born in the States with Mexican parts, that's the best way to describe myself.\" \nManager Dave Roberts said Romo won't necessarily pitch the eighth inning in a traditional setup role, as the Dodgers often mix and match, depending on game situations. \nBut Romo said he expects to pitch in \"key situations\" and he's eager to show \"what I'm made of and who I am.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:13:20.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
