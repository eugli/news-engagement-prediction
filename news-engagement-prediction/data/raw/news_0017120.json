We also checked before the game that no one had pre-existing illness.” \nNSW and Queensland Shield players at the SCG have agreed upon drinks breaks every 40 minutes, rather than every hour, and Dr Orchard was running out to the middle during these breaks to monitor the condition of players. \nCricket NSW doesn’t have jurisdiction over local cricket, but hopes individual associations will follow their lead in exercising caution. \nCountry and regional competitions are being asked to make decisions based on weather conditions in their local areas. \n“We want men and women, girls and boys, to play as much cricket as possible however duty of care comes first,” said Jones. \n“If there are any concerns about the safety and wellbeing of players and umpires the association should take the sensible approach and cancel play on Saturday.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T13:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T08:48:49.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
