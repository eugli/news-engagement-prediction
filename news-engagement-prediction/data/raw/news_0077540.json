There are so many.” \nNot having it, Kyle couldn't keep quiet. When a TMZ reporter told her about Andy's plan, she replied, \"Oh, please!\" \nThe reporter then asked if she thought Trump's former campaign manager would be a good fit. She replied, laughing, \"I don't know. Which Housewives ?\" Embed from Getty Images \nThe reality star then clarified that she thinks Andy is obiviously joking and Kellyanne won't be coming anywhere near the Housewives empire. \n\"I think that's obviously a joke. I don't think Andy wants anything to do with any of that,\" she said. \nThe reporter reasoned that Kellyanne is good at handling conflict so she'd make a great addition to the Housewives . \nNot believing it, Kyle gave some side eye and responded, \"Is she?\" \nvia GIPHY \nKnowing where her mouth gets her, that's when the Bravo star started to get skittish. \n\"I'm going to leave it at that because I'm going to get myself in very big trouble,\" she said. \"I think you could file that under the more ridiculous rumors with the Housewives .\" \nThen the real question, would she work with her? She hesitated answering with a big umm but eventually gave her 2 cents. \n\"I'd rather not,\" she said with a big laugh. \nComment below if you think Kellyanne Conway would be a good fit for the Housewives .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:26:18.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
