Photo: Getty Images \nThe last World series event is scheduled for June 24-25 in Clermont-Ferrand in France, just six and a half weeks before the start of the World Cup on August 9. \nFor Williams, Parry and other players considering to put their name in the ring to go to the tournament, the ARU has put its foot down, making it clear they will have to fulfil sevens commitments before thinking about training in a XVs environment. \nRugby Union Players' Association chief executive Ross Xenos said Australia should be trying to field its best side in order to strengthen the image of women's rugby as a whole. \n\"If there are some young players in that group who are going to make the Wallaroos more competitive, I think it's got to be on the player to make that decision,\" Xenos said. \"I don't think the ARU can assume that a player doesn't want to play without asking the question. \n\"The absolute best preparation would be if the girls could play in the XVs nationals this year and could actually have some games under their belt before the World Cup. The realistic answer is that sevens will come first. It's definitely a matter of making sure they continue to fulfil all of their obligations to the sevens programs. It's just about being open-minded. \n\"We need to ensure that we have a broader view to growing the women's game than just growing women's sevens. The 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup is a fantastic opportunity for the game in Australia to see the success of our Wallabies side and to add to the leg that the women sevens team has started.\" \nXenos said the ARU's main concerns were the risk of injury and the fact there is a Commonwealth Games and Sevens World Cup next year to prepare for. \nThe fact the ARU will treat each request on a case by case basis indicates some players may be told to stay in Australia and play in the universities competition rather than at a world cup. \n\"We understand the ARU has some concerns around injury and assuring that the women's sevens program is able to perform at its best in 2018 which is influencing some of its decision-making around the Women's World Cup,\" Xenos said. \"We're working quite collaboratively to ensure that where possible those players who would like to play at the Women's World Cup are able to take their profile and experience in the sevens into the Wallaroos environment.\" \n\"There are definitely athletes who have come across to rugby for the lure of the Olympics and have subsequently fallen in love with the sport. If there are athletes in the group who would like to continue to grow that love of rugby through playing XVs, then as a game we should get behind them and support them.\" \nIf sevens players were to make the switch, it is understood their salaries would not change, however this might cause a degree of tension among the ranks given regular Wallaroos squad members are not paid to play for their country.
