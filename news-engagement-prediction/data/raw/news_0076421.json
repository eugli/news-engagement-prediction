The map essentially plots the location of every fossil ever found by scientists, from early mammals to dinosaurs.   To search the map, you can click on different geologic eras, the strata that the organism was found in, or search the specific taxonomy you're looking for. The map shows the continents as they are today by default, but when you click on a different geological era they rearrange themselves, showing how dramatically tectonic plates have shift over millions of years. If you aren't looking for any specific creature, just click around randomly and see what pops up. You can zoom in on any part of the world and see what kinds of fossils have been found there. For example, through the map we learned that Pleistocene-era mollusks have been found in Manhattan. What roamed the Earth where you live millions of years ago?
