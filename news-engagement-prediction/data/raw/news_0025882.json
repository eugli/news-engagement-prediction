A lot of kind words were said. People were very supportive of the Muslim community. And that's great, that's fantastic, that's really heartwarming,\" said Esseghaier.\n\"But where do we go from here? We have to do something. There should be some action taken so that our words are followed by action.\"\nBeyond Motion 103\nMotion 103 will be debated in the House of Commons this week.\nLiberal MP's anti-Islamophobia motion set for debate next week\nThe open letter also calls for cities to fund police training for hate crimes, and for provinces to create anti-racism directorates and a mandatory high school class on systemic racism.\nIt also asks that Parliament declare a National Day of Remembrance and Action on Islamophobia on Jan. 29, in memory of the Quebec shooting victims.\nMORE P.E.I.
