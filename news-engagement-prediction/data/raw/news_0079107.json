I felt bad for [him],” she said, questioning if she should have added a note to the invitations or reached out to the parents of Hart’s classmates. \n“I felt terrible because I was wondering if there was more that I could do.” \nIn the end, Verbakel turned to Facebook to look for advice from other parents who have autistic children on how to handle birthdays. \nThe post got a lot of public support and attention and a group of people started planning a party for him. \nParty organizer Kyle Stewart said he identified with Hart’s experience, as he grew up with ADHD. Stewart and the other organizers who saw the post wanted to try and fix the earlier unfortunate event. \n“It’s sad. Let’s make it happy,” said Stewart. \nEverything from the space at a hotel to the food and entertainment at the party was donated. Hart even got a special birthday message from some broadcasters at TSN. \nWith a report from CTV Kitchener", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:57:01.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
