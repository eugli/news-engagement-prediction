It began using the social media tag #CNNEcensurado, which means CNNE censured. \nVenezuela’s sanctions follow a Feb. 6 CNNE report that said Venezuelan passports and visas may have been sold to individuals with suspected terrorism ties ― including to groups like Hezbollah ― from the country’s embassy in Iraq. Buyers had links to well-placed officials in the Venezuelan government, according to the report. \nA Venezuelan passport has benefits that include visa waivers to some 130 countries. (The United States is not among them.)

This Wednesday, February 15, the Venezuelan government took our TV signal off the air, denying Venezuelans access to information and news from our television network, which they have trusted for twenty years. \nCNN en Español will continue to fulfill its commitment to the public of Venezuela by offering our television signal for free on YouTube and links to our news on CNNEspanol.com, so that it has access to information that is not available in any other way. \nThis happens days after we broadcast our “ Passports in the Shadow “ investigation , which revealed that Venezuelan authorities may have issued passports and visas to people linked to terrorism. \nCNN defends the journalistic work of our chain and our commitment to truth and transparency.
