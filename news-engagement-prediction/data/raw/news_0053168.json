The authorities must immediately take a step to prevent this double execution,\" Shamini said, adding that AIM was not downplaying the seriousness of any crime committed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:46:51.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
