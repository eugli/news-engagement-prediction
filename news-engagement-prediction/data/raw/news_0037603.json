After bullying Trump and colluding with Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election cycle they are finally getting a dose of their own medicine. \nDandy Don Lemon got pissed off when Republican strategist Paris Denard refused to stop calling CNN fake news. That‚Äôs when the host abruptly shut the show down early ‚Ä¶and then walked off his own set! \nAccording to Mediaite , Lemon walked off the set and threw a pile of papers across the studio. \nI think any Republican that goes on CNN should refer to the network as #FakeNews and I am not playing. I think from this point on, any and all conservatives/Republicans should refer to CNN in the context of what they are. This once proud news organization is a shell of itself, and they aren‚Äôt trying to change. HIM FEELINGS HURT? Dandy Don Lemon Walked Off When Republican Called Show \"Fake News\" https://t.co/bSCtLarFjY \n‚Äî üéôWayne Dupree (@WayneDupreeShow) February 18, 2017 \nThis is why Lemon can bring on so many Anti-Trumpers and have a field day bashing the President and not talking about anything substantive. Watch the exchange before Lemon picked up his skirt and ran off. \nIs it any wonder that the face of the Fake News Network was actually named America‚Äôs ‚Äúworst journalist‚Äù in 2014 by the3 prestigious Columbia Journalism Review ?   Trump that CNN has absolutely NO credibility‚Ä¶", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T11:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:53:21.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
