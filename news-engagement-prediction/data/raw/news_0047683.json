Dhanapal asserted that there was no provision in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Rules to allow secret voting on a motion of confidence. \nHe had rejected pleas for secret voting by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the rebel group of the All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League because he had to go by what was provided in Rule 99 [which deals with the method of taking votes]. Under the Rule, a motion could be adopted either through voice vote or division. Considering the importance of the motion [vote of confidence], he had opted for a division. ‘Sinister plan’ \nAnnouncing the voting results, Mr. Dhanapal told the House that DMK MLAs participated in the day’s proceedings with the “plan” of bringing disrepute to the House. He charged them with showing disrespect to the office of the Speaker and his community of Arundathiars.

Stalin] had told the media his version of what transpired. \nAlso View \nUproar broke out in Tamil Nadu Assembly after Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MLAs resorted to violence over trust vote.The legislators turned violent \nOn the marshals evicting DMK MLAs during the second break, a seasoned legislator of the ruling party said he saw nothing wrong as the Speaker had ordered their removal before he adjourned the House for the second time. Disqualification process \nIt is learnt that disqualification proceedings can be initiated against the 11 rebel MLAs only when the ruling party formally gives a petition to the Speaker. \nIf the rebels stand disqualified, their seats will become vacant and by-elections will have to be held within six months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T04:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:12:10.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
