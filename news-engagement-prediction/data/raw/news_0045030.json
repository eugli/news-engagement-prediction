February 21, 2017 11:48 GMT Marine Le Pen with advisors on a tour of Beirut, Lebanon Getty Images \nFrench far-right presidential hopeful Marine Le Pen walked out of a planned meeting with Lebanon's Grand Mufti when she was asked to wear a Muslim headscarf. \nLe Pen, who is leader of the populist Front National party, had been scheduled to meet Mufti Deryan on Tuesday morning as part of her three-day visit to Lebanon. \n\"You can pass on my respects to the Grand Mufti, but I will not cover myself up,\" Le Pen told reporters. \nThe press office for the Mufti told Reuters that Le Pen had been informed of the necessity of wearing a headscarf ahead of the meeting. \nLe Pen is visiting Lebanon to meet key officials as part of her bid to boost her presidential credentials . \nLe Pen is currently leading polls ahead of the first round of the French presidential election on April 23. Polls also show her trailing in the second round run-off in May, though she has in recent weeks halved the lead of her main rival, independent Emmanuel Macron . \nShe has campaigned on an anti-Islam, anti-EU platform, and is believed to have gained support from increasing concern about France's security situation following a series of Islamist terror attacks.
