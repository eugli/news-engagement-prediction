The first thing I do every morning is get up, put my gym clothes on, and work out. No matter what day it is. No matter what’s happening. I have gym clothes right by the bed. So that it’s the first thing I see. And usually I get up around 4:30/5 a.m., usually. Sometimes earlier if I have an early flight or whatever, but it does not get missed. There’s no way I miss my workout. That is a no-no. It just doesn’t happen. \nIt’s such a habit that if it does — if I felt like it wasn’t gonna happen I would feel like something is wrong with the universe. \nSome days it will be an hour to two hours. Usually Monday through Friday are lift days, with Wednesday being a kind of stretch and run and ab day and the whole thing. But I run on the weekends. I run every day. I’m a big big runner. I run almost 4 miles a day. Simply because my brain, the way it works, it needs that kind of energy. I have a lot of energy. I actually need to burn off some. Because if I didn’t get the run in, it just wouldn’t work. \nThere was a time when I didn’t. It was when I retired from the NFL. You have — there’s a depression that happens because you’re not an athlete anymore. And I spent about a few months not working out. And I gained like 25 pounds and the whole thing. And my mood, my attitude, everything about me was down. Once I got back in the gym, it literally changed. \nI never stopped working out again, and it’s been — it’s literally my lifeblood. It’s one of those things where it’s my meditation, it’s my spa time, and I enjoy it. \nYou really need to try a workout that you like and you will see the difference in your life. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
