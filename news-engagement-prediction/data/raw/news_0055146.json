Lopez devoted her adult life to advocating for affordable housing and its tenants. \nIn 1993, she founded Vecinos Unidos Inc., or United Neighbors, a nonprofit that built the first housing development in West Dallas in at least a generation. \nA feminist, she also founded the Lesbian Latinas De Dallas. As a businesswoman, she operated Suenos Sabrosos, or Sweet Dreams, a Bishop Arts ice cream parlor that has since closed. \nLopez, 63, died Tuesday of Hodgkin's lymphoma at her sister's home in Moline, Ill., where she lived the last six days of her life. \nA memorial will be from 6 to 7 p.m. Sunday at the Cathedral of Hope's Interfaith Peace Chapel, 5910 Cedar Springs Road in Dallas. In Moline, a celebration of her life also is planned at 10 a.m. Saturday at DeRoo Funeral Home. \nLopez was born in Moline, where she and her eight siblings grew up in a low-income home, said her niece Angie Moore of Moline. It was difficult for the family to get assistance. \n\"They were always running into dead ends when they were needing things,\" Moore said. \"My grandparents worked so hard for everything. I think that she felt if there was anything she could do to help ... she was going to do it,\" Moore said. \nLopez received a bachelor's degree from Black Hawk College in Moline. She worked with Project Now, a low-income housing center in Moline. \nAfter working several years in Illinois, she moved to New York, where she was supervisor of a nonprofit landlord-tenant counseling program. She also worked on housing issues for Haven House women's shelter and was an activist leader with the annual Women's Coalition marches. \nIn 1992, she moved to Dallas to explore her family's heritage. Her parents were born on either side of the border. \n\"She didn't know much about her culture and where she came from, because she grew up in the Midwest,\" Moore said. \nIn 1995, Vecinos Unidos started Casa Rio, a planned development of 57 brick homes, just off Winnetka Avenue near the Trinity River in Dallas. The project, in an area known as Las Altos, was completed in 2001. \nLopez required that people moving into the housing she helped to build take workshops and classes on how to maintain their new homes. \n\"She wasn't going to hand anything out for free,\" her niece said. \"She wanted people to prove and show to her that they would take pride in what they were receiving.\" \nLopez was an advocate for education. Her Bishop Arts ice cream parlor regularly held poetry readings, hosted musicians and exhibited artists. She also collected books to give to children of low-income families. \nAt Suenos Sabrosos, \"she was a bartender in the ice cream business,\" her niece said. \n\"She always had an ear for everyone,\" Moore said. \"She was very private. She didn't share much about her own life, yet she was there and willing to listen and talk to anybody and help them and give them advice on anything.\" \nLopez served on several boards of directors, including the North Texas Community Development Association, the Dallas Affordable Housing Coalition (now called the North Texas Housing Coalition) and the West Dallas Chamber of Commerce. \nShe retired in December. \n\"Every dream she had she fulfilled,\" Moore said. \nLopez is survived by six sisters, Maria Lopez Animas of Chicago, Gloria Lopez, Rebecca Lopez, Victoria Lopez and Lietticia Uribe, all of Moline, and Norma Lemke of East Moline; and two brothers, David Lopez and Joe Lopez, both of Moline. \nMemorials may be made to the Jesus Chairez & Rosa Lopez Scholarship Fund at LULAC Rainbow, P.O. Box 192336, Dallas, Texas 75210. Checks should be made payable to LULAC 4871, with the memo line noting the scholarship fund in memory of Lopez.
