But the problem is not that they undercover them, as you assert, but that they overcover them. \nBy any count, the number of Americans directly impacted by terrorism is tiny. From 2002 to 2014, for example, 61 people were killed in this country by terrorists, according to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism . Over the same period, 204,753 people were victims of murder and non-negligent manslaughter. \nNo one is more aware of this than the terrorists themselves. The goal of terrorism, after all, is to terrorize. To amply their message and spread fear, they turn to news organizations. In some cases, terror groups have a sophisticated media strategy. In others, a lone killer might simply use the attention in an effort to validate his cowardly acts, leading to frequent complaints that attackers are getting too much attention and inspiring copycats. \nIn any case, some news organizations are more than happy to comply. Cable television channels, in particular, are obsessed with ratings. They are not about to underplay news stories that draw massive audiences. \nCoverage of last year’s Orlando nightclub attack was pretty much wall-to-wall and nonstop. The same was true of the attack in San Bernardino the previous year. And the attacks in Paris and Nice, even though they were far from U.S. shores, also received extensive coverage. Unreported terror attacks? Here are more than 200 articles on USA TODAY covering White House's list \nThe idea that news organizations are undercovering terrorism is laughable, or it would be were it not part of Trump’s agenda. \nIn attacking the news industry, and releasing a list of supposedly undercovered events, the administration ramps up fears about terrorism. That way, voters will be more willing to support the president's programs, including his poorly conceived plan to ban U.S. entry by refugees and by people from seven Muslim-majority nations. \nThe United States has a good example of how not to react to terrorism. The 9/11 attacks led to a number of important changes to make America safer. But fears of another attack also provided a rationale for invading Iraq, which turned out to be one of the worst foreign policy blunders in U.S. history. \nTrump is right that the Islamic State terrorist group needs to be crushed. The best way to do that is to work in concert with other nations, including several that are predominately Muslim, that are threatened by ISIL — not by making baseless assertions about news coverage. \nUSA TODAY's editorial opinions are decided by its Editorial Board , separate from the news staff.
