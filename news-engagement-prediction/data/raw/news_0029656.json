Getty \nThe 37-year-old soprano and her businessman husband Brown married in November 2015 in a ceremony at Harlem’s Riverside Church. \nThey first shared the news of Benanti’s pregnancy in August, in a tweeted photo that showed them each reading copies of What to Expect When You’re Expecting . \n“Doing a little research with @impbrown,” the Supergirl alum wrote. “Coming this winter… #BabyGirlBrown.” Doing a little research with @impbrown ! \n— Laura Benanti (@LauraBenanti) August 11, 2016 \nBenanti was busier than ever in her first trimester — leading the Broadway revival of She Loves Me alongside Zachary Levi and Jane Krakowski , for which she earned her fifth Tony nomination . She also released a single “I Like Musicals,” with all of the proceeds going to Save the Music , which is committed to keeping music education in schools. \nThen there was her headline-making Melania Trump impression on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert . \nShe didn’t calm down much from there on — working hard on a string of concert engagements across the country, including dates during her third trimester at the D.C.’s Kennedy Center in December, and writing her first book of essays: I Stole Your Boyfriend, and Other Monster Acts on My Way to Becoming a Human Woman , out sometime next year.

She’s also been a voice teacher with a studio in Kinnelon, New Jersey, for the past 35 years. The Story Goes On will mark her return to the stage. \nE! News was first to report the birth.
