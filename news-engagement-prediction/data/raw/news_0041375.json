We can hang out,” police said. The girl again kept walking, but the van stopped at the stop sign, waited for the girl and the driver said, “Do you have Snapchat? Maybe we can exchange snaps.” \nThe girl then ran away and notified her mother, who called 911, police said. \nThe suspect is described as a Hispanic male between 17 and 18 years old, with dark eyes and curly black hair on top with shaved sides, police said. He had an earring in his left ear and was wearing a blue hooded sweatshirt. The van had a red football helmet sticker on the back window. \nAnyone with information on the attempted child luring is asked to contact Area North detectives at (312) 744-8200.
