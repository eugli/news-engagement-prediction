PHOTO: AFP \nPakistan’s left-arm fast-bowler Mohammad Irfan on Saturday was suspended from Pakistan Super League (PSL) over spot-fixing allegations. \nIrfan is the third player to be suspended from the league in the past 24 hours over corruption allegations. On Friday night, Irfan’s Islamabad United teammates Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif were suspended over similar allegations. \nFollowing the suspensions, PSL chairman Najam Sethi in a statement issued by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said that the investigation is a clear example of the board’s commitment to drive corruption out of the sport. “It would not be appropriate to comment on the specifics of this case,” said Sethi. “However, this investigation is a clear demonstration of our determination to drive corruption out of our sport.” \n“We will not tolerate any form of corrupt activity and as this investigation proceeds we will not hesitate to take further decisive action as appropriate. The investigation of the PCB Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU) is backed by the ICC ACU, who has been effective in dealing with this case to date and we will continue to work in the closest collaboration as the investigation proceeds.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:07:11.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
