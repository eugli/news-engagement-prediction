Other flight teams have also expressed strong interest and we expect more to follow,” SpaceX said in a statement. \nSpaceX's as-of-yet unidentified astronauts, who have \"already paid a significant deposit to do a moon mission,\"will try to do a trip around the Moon on a Dragon 2 spacecraft, which has largely funded by NASA. \nThe announcement comes after SpaceX fired a rocket from the space agency's platform famously used in the lunar missions, which had not seen a flight since the space shuttle program ended six years ago. The SpaceX Falcon rocket launches from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida earlier this month.
