With Betances not yet eligible for arbitration at that point, the Yankees renewed his contract for the major league minimum of $507,500. Then came the this year’s standoff. The Yankees’ managing general partner, Hal Steinbrenner, said this week that there had not been a settlement with Betances because “the numbers were just too far apart.” Placing a value on Betances will be an interesting case for the arbitration panel, which does not explain its decisions. Betances is a three-time All-Star but has closed games only sporadically. That could suppress his salary even as teams begin to reconsider how to use their best relievers . He also slumped badly for three weeks last September. It would seem not to have hurt Betances’ case that Baltimore reliever Brad Brach won his arbitration case earlier Friday, getting $3.05 million in his second year of being eligible for arbitration. Though Brach has emerged as an elite setup man and was an All-Star last season, he has not been as dominant as Betances. On Friday, Betances arrived at the Vinoy Renaissance shortly before 9 a.m., with a half dozen or so advisers, including his agent, Jim Murray. Several members of Betances’ team carried armfuls of thick white binders, and at one point, someone warned the 6-foot-8 pitcher not to bump his head on a low-hanging ceiling beam. \nAdvertisement A few minutes later, the Yankees’ contingent — about 10 strong, headed by the team president, Randy Levine, and including General Manager Brian Cashman and the assistant general managers, Jean Afterman and Michael Fishman — entered. At just after 9:30 a.m., the doors to the arbitration room closed and the hearing commenced. While the sides made their cases, contestants at a ballroom-dancing competition being held at the resort paraded up and down the hall. Some ducked inside a room adjacent to the arbitration hearing; it was where a masseuse was working. It was an interesting juxtaposition, given the high-stakes nature of the hearing. Some of those who were present on Friday seemed uncharacteristically tense and tight-lipped. Perhaps they could have used a massage, too.
