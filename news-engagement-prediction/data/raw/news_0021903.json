For example, what’s the difference between Labor and the Coalition on asylum seeker policy?\nThe passion had been minimal, the contest often nuanced rather than blunt.\nBy tossing such barbs as parasite, hypocrite and sycophant at Mr Shorten — probably terms rehearsed in private tirades — Mr Turnbull has raised the possibility a genuine contest is in play.\nThere are three problematic areas for Mr Turnbull. One is: Has he nominated for a weight division too high?\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten is a trained insulter, coached by experts through a trade union career in which nicely-nicely never prevailed. And he knows good material when he sees it: he has breached former Tony Abbott adviser Peta Credlin’s copyright on “Mr Harbourside Mansion” to use it often.\nNastiness in debate is all but the default position for Mr Shorten, and he is good at it. Mr Turnbull might find he should have competed in more-polite company.\nThe second, and more important question is: What will voters think?\nMalcolm Turnbull (finally) gets fired up in Parliament yesterday. Picture: Kym Smith Source: News Corp Australia \nThe punters packed the public galleries to watch Prime Minister Paul Keating towel up opponents with stinging invective, but in the end they didn’t want to vote for him.\nOne of the more fascinating documents of 2017 will be the official Liberal Party report on the 2016 election, which saw Mr Turnbull reduced to a one-seat majority.\nIn relative terms, the campaign was a most polite engagement with Labor holding off references to Mr Turnbull’s wealth and Cayman Islands connections and Mr Turnbull making little mention of Mr Turnbull’s union record.\nThe argument within the Liberal Party was that voters would reject a negative campaign. However, the absence of negativity didn’t amount to a major advantage for Mr Turnbull.\nThe context of yesterday’s Turnbull belligerence was welfare policy.\nVoters could be asking whether the Prime Minister was avoiding that issue.\nThird: Will the name calling improve Mr Turnbull’s standing with his backbenchers?\nThere were big smiles on the faces of those sitting behind the Prime Minister yesterday. Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce was hopping with delight.\nThe leader was showing a capacity for attack and engagement which hadn’t been seen before. He was looking like he would fight for them.\nOr, to some, he might appear to have exploded with frustration after a start to the year cursed by political setbacks for the Prime Minister.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:10:34.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
