He pleaded guilty earlier this month to manslaughter in Sinclair's death.\nMichael MacPherson pleads guilty to manslaughter in death of Tanner Sinclair\nManslaughter plea in death of Tanner Sinclair exposes 'flawed system,' father says Yukon Crown prosecutors have asked for a sentence of eight to 10 years jail, while MacPherson's lawyer argued that 4 years would be more appropriate.\nMichael MacPherson pleaded guilty to manslaugher earlier this month.\nSinclair was killed in July 2014 after the two men got into an argument over a truck Sinclair had sold to MacPherson. Sinclair was stabbed five times and later died in hospital.\nProsecutor Eric Marcoux told the court that he considers this to be in the most serious category of manslaughter convictions.\nHe said MacPherson brought a knife to a fist fight, while Sinclair had no knowledge about the knife until he was being stabbed.\nMarcoux also noted MacPherson has previous assault with a weapon convictions in 2001 and 2007. The 2007 conviction stemmed from an incident that saw MacPherson smash a beer bottle in someone's face, requiring 96 stiches and resulting in the victim losing vision in one eye.\n'That's all he can do' MacPherson's defence lawyer Ray Dieno told the Yukon court that 48 months is the right sentence for his client. He said MacPherson never wanted to kill Sinclair, while acknowledging he went too far in that fight.\nDieno submitted letters of reference that described MacPherson as a hardworking and kind person who was always ready to offer a helping hand to those in need. He also detailed how his client is working to control his alcohol and drug addictions and learn skills to help him build a better life in the future.\n\"He's working hard to transform himself, that's all he can do,\" Dieno said.\nMacPherson also stood up in court on Wednesday, to address Sinclair's family and other members of the community.\nHis voice broke slightly with emotion as he spoke of regret for what happened, also saying that he knows what it's like to lose a family member, as his brother died in a car accident in 2002.\n\"I need you to know I never intended for any of this to happen,\" he said.\nWith files from Dave Croft", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:50:47.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
