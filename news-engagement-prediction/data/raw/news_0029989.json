Through the program, employees share in the success they create together through hard work and a focus on the customer. \nDelta employees will be honored for their record-breaking performance on Feb. 14 at events held across its global network. The airline also will thank employees with ad placements in U.S. newspapers, including The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, among others. \nDelta’s profit sharing payouts will have an even bigger impact on local communities than the numbers suggest because of what economists call “the multiplier effect.” \nFor example, in metro Atlanta, where Delta will pay its more than 32,000 employees more than $392 million, the economic impact will actually be more than double: an estimated $957 million, according to a local economist. \nIn addition to profit sharing, Delta's Shared Rewards program pays out monthly bonuses for meeting corporate operational goals throughout the year. In 2016, Delta employees earned more than $90 million in Shared Rewards as the company achieved history-making operational and financial results. \nEmployees will also receive a 6 percent raise in base pay in April, resulting in a total pay rate increase of 25 percent in two years.
