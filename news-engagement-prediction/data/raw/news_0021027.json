I can share my energy with the team in that position. He has been great for me, but not just for me, the team as well. \n“My first two seasons here I played 71 games, so it’s not a bad number of games. But, of course, I cannot lie. This is the time I am enjoying most at Man United. \n“I try to be aggressive, whenever we lose the ball I try to get it back always, but sometimes when the see [read] the football [game], you can recover more possession.

I never want to get an opponent injured, but I am aggressive and always looking for the ball. \n“This season I’m getting a lot of minutes on the pitch, I think I’m the fourth in the team in terms of minutes.” \nU nited are almost certainly out of the title race given they are 14 points behind leaders Chelsea, who Herrera argued, were the only side which has deserved to beat them this season. \nBut having progressed to the knockout phase of the Europa League, which resumes later this month when they take French side St Etienne, and into the last 16 of the FA Cup, Herrera believes Mourinho’s first season as manager is going to be a successful one. \nMuch, though, will ultimately depend on whether they can secure Champions League football, with Herrera suggesting it should be, given United’s history, via a top four finish.

But we’re still alive in three competitions. \n“When we are on the pitch you can recognise a big team playing. OK, sometimes we don’t win but we are always the protagonist team, we are always getting more chances than the opponent. \n“Almost always – I just remember Liverpool away was different, but most games if I am not wrong - we have had more possession than our opponents. \n“Normally the keeper of the opponent has been their best player, so that shows we are a big team. We are playing always attacking football and sooner or later the goals will come. They came against Leicester but I think we deserved to get some victories before that as well. \n“We have three competitions to play for and in the Premier League we have to finish in the top four,” he added. We will not be 100% happy if we are fourth because we want to finish as high as possible, but minimum, we have to be in the top four and fight for the rest of the titles.” \nA nder Herrera was speaking at the unveiling of the TAG Heuer Manchester United Watch Collection.
