Ryan LaFlare vs. Roan Carneiro Round 1 The southpaw LaFlare takes the center of the cage and, after 30 seconds or so, lands a thudding kick to Carneiro's midsection. Carneiro answers with a few leg kicks as he continues to circle the outside. LaFlare closes in again, lands the same body kick to Carneiro's right side. Another body kick connects, and this time LaFlare presses in to push Carneiro against the fence. They disengage after a few seconds, LaFlare closes the gap, but now Carneiro is waiting with a right hand. LaFlare grabs for a takedown but quickly abandons the shot. \"Jucao\" tries a takedown of his own and gets rolled to the ground by LaFlare with an underhook. Carneiro tries to shrimp inside and attack LaFlare's legs, but the New Yorker pushes down on Carneiro's head, and now both men come back to their feet. One minute left as LaFlare stifles another takedown attempt, but Carneiro digs an underhook and turns LaFlare against the wall. LaFlare separates after landing a pair of knees to the gut. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 LaFlare Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 LaFlare Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 LaFlare Round 2 Just as he did in round one, LaFlare attacks Carneiro with heavy body kicks in the opening minute of the second frame. Carneiro slips to the ground at the base of the fence as he backpedals to avoid LaFlare's advance, and LaFlare follows him to the floor. The Brazilian slows LaFlare with closed guard, wrapping up the top man's left arm to limit space for ground-and-pound. The welterweights come back to their feet with 3:00 on the clock; 30 seconds later, LaFlare ducks under a hook and shoots a double. Carneiro threatens with a headlock as he defends the takedown, so LaFlare bails out and goes back to advancing. As he's backed up to the fence, Carneiro takes a left hand to the temple and slides to the ground. LaFlare gives chase again, trying to pound out his wounded opponent, but Carneiro gets a headlock from half-guard to slow things down again. LaFlare pops his head free and postures up briefly to land an elbow, but it's slow going here in the final minute. Referee Dan Miragliotta calls for action, then warns Carneiro for looping his toes in the chain-link fence. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-8 LaFlare Chris Nelson scores the round 10-8 LaFlare Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 LaFlare Round 3 LaFlare begins the final round with more pressure, moving Carneiro backward to the fence. LaFlare whiffs on a spinning back-kick but transitions straight into an effortless double-leg takedown. Unable to establish an advantageous position on the mat, LaFlare backs up and the welterweights come back to their feet. LaFlare is keeping things tighter in this round, giving Carneiro very little space on the fence and now coming back to clinch with just over half the round remaining. Carneiro pushes back to the center, where LaFlare jams a left hand in the jiu-jitsu black belt's face. Carneiro moves backward again, waits for a knee strike from LaFlare and grabs hold of the leg. LaFlare gets pushed backward to the fence but reverses the position. It's \"Jucao\" who wins out in the clinch, tripping LaFlare to the ground, but now LaFlare works on a kimura from the bottom. Carneiro frees his arm with just about one minute left, now working from LaFlare's half guard. Carneiro is looking for an arm-triangle choke, wraps up LaFlare's head and left arm, then steps over to full mount. LaFlare resists the choke and deflects Carneiro's last-ditch ground-and-pound until the horn. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 Carneiro (29-27 LaFlare) Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 LaFlare (30-26 LaFlare) Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 LaFlare (30-27 LaFlare) The Official Result Rick Glenn vs. Phillipe Nover Round 1 Nover swings wide punches over the top and clips the rangy southpaw Glenn, who moves forward and tries to land long punches. Nover scores with a body kick-left hand combo, and a few seconds later lands a left high kick to the side of Glenn's head. Glenn absorbs the kick and strikes back with a short, hard left hand before Nover gets out of the pocket. More circling on the feet through the middle of the round, Glenn looking to close the gap but running into some counter hooks from the shorter man. Nover goes upstairs with the left high kick again, and once again Glenn just eats it. Glenn catches a kick and forces Nover to yank the leg back, then sprint away to avoid being countered. Glenn looks for a late takedown but can only corral Nover against the fence. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 Nover Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 Nover Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 Nover Round 2 Nover lines up southpaw at the start of round two but continues to lob left high kicks at Glenn's head. Back to orthodox goes Nover as Glenn tries to pressure forward; Nover's counter left hook has already landed a few times in the first minute of the round. Glenn sprawls well on a poor shot from Nover, then continues pressuring the UFC vet backward to the fence. Glenn spends the better part of a minute hunting for a takedown, repeatedly switching levels. Nover defends well with his back on the wall, now takes an opportunity to fire a few knees at the leaning Glenn's head. Nover is scoring with short punches in the clinch, too, while Glenn's hands are tied up. The featherweights split with one minute on the clock; Glenn goes under a left high kick and comes back with a flush left hand to Nover's jaw. Glenn puts Nover back on the fence and lands a pair of knees in the Thai clinch; Nover answers with a standing elbow as time expires. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 Glenn Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 Glenn Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 Glenn Round 3 Nover snaps off two or three solid jabs in the first minute of the final round, while Glenn works his opponent's lead leg with kicks. Two more stiff jabs connect for Nover, who has a high kick caught by Glenn, but he whirls around to hit \"The Gladiator\" with a fadeaway spinning backfist. Glenn closes in to press Nover against the fence with an underhook, then drops to try a single-leg shot. As he did in round two, Nover is getting the better of this position, landing strikes to the side of Glenn's head while Glenn is focused on a takedown which doesn't materialize. Referee Yves Lavigne separates the fighters inside the two-minute mark, but Glenn soon goes for another takedown. Nover extracts himself from the position this time, popping Glenn with another jab on the way out. Glenn's face is red from the punches, and now he absorbs another left hook, a right straight. Back to the clinch they go, Glenn on the outside again, now stomping on Nover's feet. Nover gets tripped to the ground but gets right back up; Glenn holds him on the cage and gets the final word with a pair of slashing elbows in the Thai clinch. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 Glenn (29-28 Glenn) Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 Nover (29-28 Nover) Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 Glenn (29-28 Glenn) The Official Result Nik Lentz vs. Islam Makhachev Round 1 Lentz latches on to an early kick from Makhachev and tries to hustle the sambo specialist against the fence, but Makhachev quickly spins him around and then trips him to the floor. Lentz grabs a no-arm headlock but can't cinch the guillotine as Makhachev repositions in half guard and pops his head loose. Lentz uses butterfly guard to elevate, but before he can get up, Makhachev dives back on top to keep the American grounded. Heavy top pressure from Makhachev here as the lightweights hit the midway point of round one. Lentz is shifting and trying to pivot underneath but can't seem to get anything going. Makhachev postures up to land a few punches, gets kicked away again, and this time Lentz is able to jump back to his feet. It's only a matter of seconds before Makhachev hits another trip and has Lentz down at the base of the fence again. Lentz goes fishing for the guillotine again in the final 30 seconds; Makhachev is caught in the headlock but does not seem to be in trouble, and he rides out the remainder of the round. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 Makhachev Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 Makhachev Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 Makhachev Round 2 Makhachev has a left high kick blocked, then goes to the chest of Lentz with a front kick up the center. Lentz answers with a body kick of his own but takes a pair of punches from Makhachev on the counter. Another left high kick from Makhachev buzzes Lentz's head; when Lentz tries to swing punches in return, Makhachev backpedals, stops and wraps up the incoming American in the clinch. Another trip lands for Makhachev, who has Lentz back on the ground with more than three and a half minutes left in the round. Lentz uses butterfly hooks to elevate but can't escape from underneath Makhachev, who's bearing down heavy on top with a shoulder pressed against Lentz's throat. Lentz tries the guillotine again but releases as Makhachev nearly steps over to full mount. Leaning left to right across Lentz's body, Makhachev looks to be framing up an arm-triangle choke. Makhachev steps off to side control, but he's on the wrong side to finish the choke, so he tries to work a shoulder choke instead. Makhachev steps over to full mount with 25 seconds left; Lentz goes belly-down and then rolls to a knee, not allowing Makhachev to land anything in the closing moments. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 Makhachev Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 Makhachev Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 Makhachev Round 3 Lentz comes out aggressive, swinging at Makhachev with power punches and spinning backfists, but it's a body kick from Makhachev that appears to do the first real damage of the round. Lentz wraps up the Russian with a body lock and hugs him against the fence; Makhachev hits a lovely trip and puts Lentz on his back once again. Lentz still appears to be looking for the guillotine from underneath, but it's not there so far in this round. Makhachev works for a quick armlock, gives it up and instead drops short elbows and punches on Lentz's face. Lentz tries to sit up, gets stuffed back down and mounted. Lentz gives up his back, leading to heavier punches from Makhachev, thudding left hands that have referee Kevin MacDonald taking a closer look at the action. Makhachev switches to a rear-naked choke, but Lentz peels away one of his hooks and escapes the choke, then jumps to his feet. Lentz tries to hold Makhachev on the wall in the final seconds, but Makhachev trips him to the ground one last time. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-8 Makhachev (30-26 Makhachev) Chris Nelson scores the round 10-8 Makhachev (30-26 Makhachev) Mike Sloan scores the round 10-8 Makhachev (30-26 Makhachev) The Official Result Wilson Reis vs. Ulka Sasaki Round 1 Sasaki opens with a body kick but gets tagged over the top with Reis' right-handed counter. Reis level-changes beautifully and executes a quick takedown, but Sasaki threatens with a kimura from the bottom to work back to his feet. Sasaki lands a jab and sticks out his tongue at Reis, who grabs for a leg but can't take down \"Ulka\" this time. The long right hand of Sasaki continues to connect with Reis' face until midway through the round, when the Brazilian dives for and completes another double-leg takedown at the fence. Sasaki tries the kimura sweep again, but this time Reis threatens with an arm-triangle choke and stays on top. Reis postures up in half guard and slams Sasaki's face with some short elbow strikes. Referee Dan Miragliotta warns Sasaki for lacing his toes in the fence, and now Sasaki closes his guard around Reis with 80 seconds left. Sasaki absorbs some short punches before kicking Reis away and jumping to his feet, but Reis comes back to hold Sasaki against the fence until the end of the round. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 Reis Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 Reis Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 Reis Round 2 Reis opens with a few low kicks before changing levels and spinning Sasaki to the ground once again. The flyweights are in the center of the cage, Reis posturing up to pass guard, now stepping over to full mount. Sasaki gives up his back, and Reis quickly establishes both hooks. Sasaki peels away one hook, rolls over to take top position, but now both men spring back up. Sasaki tries a double-leg and gets stonewalled by Reis, who forces Sasaki back to the canvas at the halfway point of the round. Sasaki gives up his back again, and this time he's unable to pry away Reis' hooks. Reis tries a neck crank, can't get it and switches to an arm-triangle choke, but there's nothing there either. Instead, Reis reattaches himself to Sasaki's back with a body triangle and goes for the neck crank again. Sasaki won't tap and once again manages to peel Reis' arms away from his face. Sasaki escapes to his feet with 20 seconds on the clock, but Reis takes him down again almost immediately, and the Brazilian finishes the round on top. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 Reis Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 Reis Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 Reis Round 3 Reis is the aggressor as the final round begins, pressuring Sasaki backward to the fence, landing a few low kicks before moving in for the clinch. Sasaki denies a double-leg and pushes Reis away. Reis takes a jab to the grill, swings back and turns Sasaki's head with a whipping overhand right. Seconds later, Reis shoots inside and pushes Sasaki to the fence with a single-leg, now switches to a double and completes the takedown. Sasaki stands up, nearly surrendering his back in the process, and now circles away with two minutes remaining. Reis bobs and weaves for 30 seconds, then ducks under a right hand and plows Sasaki back to the ground. Reis tries back-mount, but Sasaki slips out the back door and takes Reis' back in the transition. Sasaki wraps up a body triangle from the back and goes searching for a rear-naked choke with under one minute remaining. Sasaki drops elbows, now left hands on the side of Reis' head. Reis is concerned only with wrist control, keeping himself out of choke danger until the final horn sounds. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 Sasaki (29-28 Reis) Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 Reis (30-27 Reis) Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 Reis (30-27 Reis) The Official Result Randy Brown vs. Belal Muhammad Round 1 Muhammad uses low kicks to advance on the taller Brown, who snaps off long jabs which redden Muhammad's nose in the early going. Muhammad keeps the leg kicks coming, now picks off a right hand from Brown with a short inside left. Brown forces Muhammad backward with a stiff jab, and both men miss as they load up on power punches. Muhammad's kicks continue to be the most effective strikes in the round, with one shot nearly buckling the leg of Brown as he backs up near the fence. Muhammad presses forward and digs into Brown's body with a left hand before slamming his lead leg with another kick. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 Muhammad Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 Muhammad Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 Muhammad Round 2 Muhammad opens round two with yet another low kick, then another, but his forward momentum is slowed when Brown narrowly misses with a front kick up the middle. Muhammad throws another low kick, now with an overhand right behind it, and he closes in to press Brown against the fence. Moving to a rear waistlock, Muhammad tries to lift and slam Brown, but \"Rude Boy\" slips free and circles away. Brown opens a cut underneath Muhammad's right eye with a punch; seconds later, Muhammad appears to catch a finger to the eye, but it goes unnoticed by referee Yves Lavigne, who has been warning Brown to keep his hands closed. Muhammad brings the fight back to the fence, jamming Brown against a post with head-and-arm control. Brown underhooks and escapes when Muhammad tries to drop for a double, now circles away. Muhammad complains of another eye poke to the ref, but again Lavigne takes no action. Brown blocks a head kick at the 70-second mark; Muhammad ducks under Brown's counterpunch and runs him to the ground near the fence. Muhammad jumps on the kneeling Brown's back and establishes both hooks, now tries to soften up Brown with punches. Brown is using two-on-one wrist control to fend off the rear-naked choke, but it leaves his face open for Muhammad's left hands. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 Muhammad Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 Muhammad Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 Muhammad Round 3 Brown jabs and kicks his way forward on Muhammad, but one of his front kicks lands to the cup. Referee Lavigne asks if Muhammad is OK, and Muhammad gives a thumbs-up to indicate he's good to keep fighting. A few seconds later, Muhammad shoots for a takedown up against the fence, pulls Brown's legs out from under him and takes him down again. Brown throws up a triangle, switches to an armbar attempt but can't get a grip on Muhammad's inside arm. Muhammad tries to punch through Brown's guard, but the longer man is making things difficult from the bottom. Muhammad jumps on Brown's back as Brown tries to stand, now with less than two minutes left to fight. Brown buries his chin, then rolls to his side, while Muhammad peppers his body with punches. Brown spins around and suddenly winds up on top with 15 seconds left. He stands over Muhammad and tries to punch out a late finish, but he runs out of time. Sherdog Scores Tristen Critchfield scores the round 10-9 Muhammad (30-27 Muhammad) Chris Nelson scores the round 10-9 Muhammad (30-27 Muhammad) Mike Sloan scores the round 10-9 Muhammad (30-27 Muhammad) The Official Result", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:10:29.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
