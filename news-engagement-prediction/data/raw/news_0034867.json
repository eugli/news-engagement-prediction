Microwave Depending on the size of your office, the microwave can be used up to 30 times each day, harbouring a combination of meat and vegetable particles, and creating a nest for bacteria. Germs need warmth, food and moisture to multiply, and allowing the internal top to be splattered with food particles can cause a potential health risk. Depending on the size of your office, the microwave can be used up to 30 times each day, harbouring a combination of meat and vegetable particles, and creating a nest for bacteria 4. Soap dispenser You’ve downed your morning coffee, gone for a bathroom break and washed your hands with the soap dispenser. However, you would be wise to be wary of just how dirty the dispensers can be. A study by the University of Arizona found that a quarter of office dispensers are contaminated with faecal bacteria. If you wash your hands thoroughly, that’s fine. However, many people do not and therefore leave themselves vulnerable to infection. 5. Your desk With more than 10 million germs to be found on the average work desk, it accommodates 400 times more bacteria than a toilet seat. To keep your workspace clean and healthy, wipe down weekly with an antibacterial wipe or vinegar-based solution. A study by the University of Arizona found that a quarter of office dispensers are contaminated with faecal bacteria while keyboards are notorious for harbouring bacteria 6. Your keyboard Keyboards are notorious for harbouring bacteria, especially as we press every single key continuously for up to 8 hours each day. Skin cells, food residue and sweat mature and spread in such a small space comparatively. with more than 3,295 bacteria per square inch, shake and wipe down your keyboard weekly with a slightly damp cloth. 7. Your mouse Given that your hand can be placed on a mouse for up to 8 hours each day, they are heavily exposed to bacteria generated from sweat, food particles and dust. With 10% of office workers admitting to never cleaning their mouse, a study found that they can contain up to 1,676 microbes per square inch, a lavatory seat has only a fraction of that number! 8. Printer and copier With everyone battling it out to get their copies printed on time, the average printer and copier machine is touched up to 300 times a day - especially the interface and touchpad. With everyone battling it out to get their copies printed on time, the average printer and copier machine is touched up to 300 times a day - especially the interface and touchpad This makes it a key nesting ground for nasty bacteria. Simply wipe over the surface and keypad with a PC wipe before each use. 9. Your headphones It’s common to see colleagues sharing headphones, but before each use, but it would be wise to find your own and store them for future use. Bacteria spreads like wildfire thanks to hair fibres, sweat and earwax, potentially causing facial and ear rashes as well as lice. After one hour of use, bacteria and germs can increase 700 times! 10. Chewing your pens Again, transfer is the huge problem to the nervous habit of chewing pens or pencils. The pen has been touching germy hands all day - perhaps that were not your own. Chewing on a pen will therefore transfer bacteria and nasty germs to your mouth and, with 1 in 5 office workers admitting to chewing on their pens, you probably want to avoid borrowing one from your colleague!
