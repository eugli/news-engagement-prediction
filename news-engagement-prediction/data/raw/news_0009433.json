The special relationship. Let’s invite him, let’s capture his heart. Let’s make sure we’ve got this great relationship.’ \n“Donald Trump is a shark. He doesn’t know what he did yesterday, he’s not altogether sure what he’s doing today. He’s eating for the day. If Theresa May thinks she’s made a deal with him, she is sorely mistaken.” . @Nick_Hewer says Theresa May has been foolish in rushing to make deals with the new American president #bbcqt pic.twitter.com/MAZ6KlLZ9Z — BBC Question Time (@bbcquestiontime) February 2, 2017 \nOn the ban, he quoted journalist Patrick Cockburn who said Trump “has turned himself into the greatest recruiting sergeant” for extreme Islamist groups. He added: \n“What he has done with that long-winded signature of his is to turn every Muslim in the world to question where they stand in the eyes of one of the greatest nations in the world. And they feel less for the States now and that inexorably leads to recruits joining ISIS rather than fighting ISIS.” \nTrump and Hewer’s former boss, Lord Alan Sugar , have sparred repeatedly on Twitter over the years on everything from ratings to wind farms.
