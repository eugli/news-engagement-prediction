On the heels of raising $15 million , software firm SalesLoft is announcing plans to add 250 jobs over the next five years and relocate its headquarters to Midtown. SalesLoft will move its HQ from a small mid-rise Buckhead office building next to Atlanta Tech Village to Regions Plaza, a trophy office tower at 14th and West Peachtree. The 24-story building stands amid a spate of projects, both planned and underway, including a Whole Foods Market’s flagship store, a new apartment tower developed Miami-based The Related Group, and a $400 million mixed-use project proposed by Selig Enterprises Inc. Regions Plaza. The new development is clustering around MARTA’s Arts Center Station. SalesLoft will eventually house about 300 people at its new Midtown headquarters. It plans to begin moving into the 32,000-square foot space — more than double the size of its current Buckhead offices — this August. Cushman & Wakefield’s Lawrence Gellerstedt and Clinton McKellar represented SalesLoft in negotiations for the five-year lease. SalesLoft also retains expansion rights in the tower. Last month, Atlanta Business Chronicle reported SalesLoft raised $15 million, led by Atlanta serial entrepreneur David Cummings . The Series B investment values SalesLoft at about $100 million. Its move to Regions Plaza continues a turnaround for the tower, which just two years ago saw its occupancy at just 35 percent. SalesLoft will bring that number to about 95 percent. In 2013, Crocker Partners LLC gained controlling interest the building, formerly known as Atlantic Center Plaza. It was renamed after Regions Financial Corp. moved in to the tower and put its name across the top. Stream Realty Partners has been leasing the building over the past few years on behalf of Crocker Partners and helped spur the turnaround in its occupancy.
