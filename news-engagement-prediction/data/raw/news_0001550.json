Griezmann, who is likely to be given the No. 7 shirt if he completes a move to United, has a close friendship with United midfielder Paul Pogba and that is proving an influential factor in the club’s efforts to entice the 25-year-old. Griezmann scored for Atletico against Barcelona in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday night. \nDiego Simeone, the Atletico coach, has already opened the door for Griezmann to leave and Jose Mourinho, desperate to add more cutting edge upfront, has identified the Frenchman as his leading summer transfer target, with United one of the few clubs able and prepared to fund such a deal. Griezmann is one of the most exciting players in Europe \nW ith Simeone expected to leave Atletico in the summer after taking the unusual step last September of shortening his contract with the Madrid club by two years, one considerable barrier to Griezmann departing is expected to be removed. \nIn addition, Atletico are due to move into a new 67,000-capacity stadium next season and it is thought the club will have to consider the sale of at least one leading player to help offset some of the loans they have taken out to fund the Wanda Metropolitano project on the site of the former La Peineta athletics stadium. \nSimeone has had a significant part to play in helping to turn Griezmann into one of the world’s most revered strikers but the Atletico coach was adamant he would not stand in the player’s way if he was determined to leave. How was your teams January transfer window? \nA sked about the speculation surrounding Griezmann’s future, Simeone said: “I don’t tie anybody down. I simply work in order to continue getting better for the good of the club. \n“He [Griezmann] is in an extraordinary moment. He is working well, he has got back on the scoresheet. He is currently in great form and it’s normal that the top clubs in the world want him. I’m not surprised that those that can afford him are seeking him.” \nGriezmann’s release clause was increased from €80 million when he signed a new deal last June that ties him to Atletico until June 2021.
