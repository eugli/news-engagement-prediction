Lots of it . You must be a natural-born citizen and at least 35 years old. You can be a Christian, a Jew or a Muslim ; it doesn't matter if you're of no particular religion at all. It helps to have a college degree . \nBut do you actually need experience to be president of the United States? \nTechnically, no, you don't need any political experience to hold the highest office in the land. In fact the 2016 presidential contest featured several candidates who had never served in elected office — retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former tech executive Carly Fiorina , to name two — and they held their own in the debates and early primaries. \nRelated Story: Requirements to Be President of the United States \nOne of the candidates who had no political experience even turned out to be the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump . The billionaire businessman and reality-television star is the first presidential nominee to never have held political office since Dwight D. Eisenhower won the Republican nomination in 1952. \nStill, the number of people who have served in the White House without having previously served in an elected office is small. Even our most inexperienced presidents — Woodrow Wilson , Theodore Roosevelt and George H.W. Bush — held office before entering the White House. The first six presidents in American history previously served as elected delegates to the Continental Congress. And since then most presidents have served as governors, U.S. senators or members of Congress — or all three. Does Experience Matter for Presidents? \nHaving held an elected position before serving in the White House certainly does not guarantee a president will perform well in the highest office in the land. Consider James Buchanan, a skilled politician who consistently ranks as the worst president in history among many historians because of his failure to take a position on slavery or deal Secession Crisis . Eisenhower, meantime, often performs well in surveys of American political scientists and historians even though has never held elected office before the White House. So, of course, does Abraham Lincoln, one of America's greatest president but someone who had little previous experience. \nHaving no experience can be a benefit. In modern elections, some presidential candidates have scored points among a disaffected and angry electorate by portraying themselves as outsiders or novices. Candidates who have intentionally distances themselves from the so called political \" establishment \" or elite include pizza-chain executive Herman Cain, wealthy magazine publisher Steve Forbes and businessman Ross Perot, who ran one of the most successful independent campaigns in history . \nMost American presidents served in elected office before being elected president, though. Many presidents served as governors or U.S. senators first. A few were members of the U.S. House of Representatives before being elected president. \nHere's a look at the presidents who had political experience before entering the White House. Continental Congress Delegates Who Went On To Be President \nThe first five presidents served as elected delegates to the Continental Congress. Two of the delegates also went on to serve in the U.S. Senate before running for president. \nThe five Continental Congress delegates who ascended to the presidency are: George Washington", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:06:05.432+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
