He has always been protective of Carol, ever since he consoled her when she lost Sophia. It is arguable that he can be overprotective, and perhaps this lie is an example of that. \nHowever, their relationship has always been a weird but solid one, built on mutual trust and respect. That trust may be in jeopardy now with Daryl’s lie, but it was clear in the moment Daryl wasn’t thinking of the consequences. He was simply trying to protect Carol, as he’s always done. \nIt’s only a matter of time before Carol discovers the real truth of the situation. Daryl’s lie may have worked in the moment, to both spare Carol pain and to keep her from getting further involved with Ezekiel, but Carol has proved nothing but resourceful and savvy throughout the course of the show. \nDaryl’s lie simply prolongs the inevitable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:44:51.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
