Article continues below \nHe said : “I think I’m the only person in the world who says no to Joe Root as England captain. \n\"If it was down to me right now I’d give Stuart Broad the job.\" Article continues below Watch: Joe Hart concedes one of the most bizarre goals of his career v Empoli \nSwann played alongside Root during the infant stages of Root's international career and fears that the 26-year old's attempts to prove his leadership qualities for the role of captain have already diminished his game as a batsman. \n“I think Joe is growing into a more mature player and he is trying to be more serious and trying to prove to everyone that he’s got the character to be captain. \n“But I think it is actually affecting his batting already and he’s not the cheeky, dynamic, ‘joie de vivre’-type player that he was two or three years ago.\" \nSwann went on to say that he believes Root has the potential to become the \"best batsman\" England have ever produced, but that the pressure of becoming England captain would only act as a \"burden\" to his development. \n“He’s not scoring the same huge amount of runs, he’s being consistent, but I think he’s just lost a little bit in trying to be this captain material and I really worry. \n“I think we should leave Joe Root to be the best batsman this country has ever produced which he would be without the burden of being the captain. I wish they would leave him alone.” \nWhat do you make of Swann's comments? Who do you believe should be the next England captain?
