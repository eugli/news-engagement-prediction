Heavy rain is expected to return Wednesday night and continue throughout the week. Officials don’t expect that rain to overwhelm the reservoir as crews continue draining water and making repairs.

The rainy season typically continues through March, and spring will bring runoff from melting snowpacks. \n“That will be the challenge at Lake Oroville in the coming months — keeping people downstream safe while managing the dam itself,” atmospheric scientist and Washington Post weather editor Angela Fritz wrote Tuesday. “If the past is any indicator of the future, they should prepare for more precipitation , not less.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:20:46.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
