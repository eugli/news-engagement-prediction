If the Browns hadnâ€™t been awarded that pick, the Patriots would have received a fourth-round selection in the 2018 draft. \nThe Patriots now have a first-round pick (32nd overall), a second-round pick (64th overall), two third-round picks (96th and 103rd overall), a fourth-round pick, two fifth-round picks (one from the Denver Broncos for tight end AJ Derby and one comp pick) and a seventh-round selection ( from the Detroit Lions in the Kyle Van Noy trade). \nThe Patriots could receive additional picks if they decide to trade backup quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo. \nThumbnail photo via Scott R.
