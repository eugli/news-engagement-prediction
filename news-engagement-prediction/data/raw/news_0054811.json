Article continues below \nOver the years, it would be inevitable that Wenger learned to swear like an Englishman, and reading through the report it seems that he has picked up the trait as good as anyone. \nTaylor wrote that Wenger told him to f*** off twice before saying “You are dishonest to your federation.” Article continues below What caused an angry reaction from Antoine Greizmann's vs Bayer Leverkusen \n“Following the award of a penalty kick against his team in approx. 92nd min, Mr Wenger left his technical area to confront me in disagreement at the decision. Before he said anything I said: ‘Think carefully before you say anything,’\" Taylor wrote. \n“He responded by saying ‘you are dishonest to your federation.’ \n\"I considered this to be questioning both mine and the referee, Jon Moss’s integrity and impartiality. I stated to Mr. Wenger that such a comment was not acceptable and he told me to “f*** off” on two separate occasions.” \nNot only was Wenger hit with a four-match ban, he had to cough up a £25,000 fine that related to a push on Jon Moss in the tunnel. \nHowever, the report states that nobody found his behaviour “particularly violent in nature”. \n“Nevertheless, all officials ought to be able to do their jobs without fear of being manhandled and the Commission determined that the sanction attached to the charges levied against Mr Wenger should reflect this.” \nBoth Moss ans Taylor deny that Wenger labelled them a “f***ing cheat,” which had been largely reported at the time. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
