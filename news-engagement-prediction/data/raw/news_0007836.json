People Are Mad That Trump Slammed The Judge Who Blocked His Travel Ban “No one is above the law, not even the president.” Tasneem Nashrulla BuzzFeed News Reporter 1. On Saturday, President Donald Trump slammed a federal judge — nominated by former President George W. Bush and approved 99-0 by the Senate — for blocking his immigration ban. \nThe opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) In his tweet, Trump questioned the legitimacy of US District Court Judge James Robart, who issued a nationwide order in Washington state on Friday, halting enforcement of parts of the immigration ban Trump signed late last month. \n“The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!” Trump said in his tweet.

Chuck Schumer said the president’s attack on the judge showed a “lack of respect for the Constitution.” \nPOTUS's attack on Judge Robart shows a disdain for an ind. judiciary that doesn't bend to his wishes & lack of respect for the Constitution. — Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) In a statement, Schumer said, “With each action testing the Constitution, and each personal attack on a judge, President Trump raises the bar even higher for Judge Gorsuch’s nomination to serve on the Supreme Court. His ability to be an independent check will be front and center throughout the confirmation process.” ID: 10464660 3.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio warned Trump that his defiance of the judiciary might not end well for him. \nWe've seen a president try to defy the judiciary before. His name was Richard Nixon.

Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, had a similar take. \nI'm trying to imagine how people would react if a Judge Robart had called Trump \"this so-called president.\" — Laurence Tribe (@tribelaw) 14. Liberal political commentator Sally Kohn called Trump’s tweet “incredibly worrisome and dangerous.” \n\"so-called\" -- President of the United States challenging the authority/credibility of federal judge. Incredibly wo… https://t.co/u5fQoSTxU8 — Sally Kohn (@sallykohn) ID: 10464705 \nI remember a simpler time when Trump only dismissed a judge's opinion because the judge's parents were Mexican. https://t.co/qpQUXjgW3P — Baratunde (@baratunde) ID: 10464713 16. Some people, including CNN’s Jake Tapper, noted that there was difference between a president criticizing a court’s decision and dismissing the authority of a judge to make it. \nHuge difference between criticizing a court's decision & dismissing the authority of a \"so-called judge\" to make it. https://t.co/E5zn9ifgn5 — Kevin M.

It's a tweet. — Jonah Goldberg (@JonahNRO) ID: 10464758 BuzzFeed News reached out to several members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for their responses. \nAt the time of publishing, only Sen.
