(Photo: Provided by Scot and Dawn Pollard) \nDawn Pollard is a Colorado native, while Scot Pollard, who has lived in many different places during his 11-year career playing in the NBA, considers Lawrence, Kan., home. For now, the couple lives in Carmel. They are active in the community and support the Indianapolis Zoo by serving on the Honorary Committee for Zoobilation, presented by Indianapolis Power & Light Co. This year’s event is scheduled for June 9, and tickets go on sale Feb. 1. When the Pollards enjoy a date night or go out with friends, they can often be spotted (with a combined height of 13 feet, they're hard to miss!) at one of their favorite eateries around town: \n1. Bonge’s Tavern (9830 W. 230 N., Perkinsville) One of our favorite restaurants in Indiana and one of Scot's favorites in the world. We love the tailgating, the building and the story, and Chef Tony always impresses with his small, rotating menu. We always order the Perkinsville Pork (the only permanent entree). \n2. Marrow (1106 Prospect St.) A fantastic and hip place to share food where the emphasis is on creating unique, sexy flavors and pairing ingredients you'd never think would go together. It's one of those restaurants you could spend hours in, enjoying your company and sampling everything. \n3. Kizuki Ramen & Izakaya (2450 E. 146th St., Carmel) We love ethnic food, so this place is fast becoming a favorite — and the kids love it. The spicy ramen is our go-to dish, but don't forget to order the gyoza. Sapporo on draft pairs nicely with the spice of the soup. \n4. Sullivan's Steakhouse (3316 E. 86th St.) Sullivan’s has a wonderful staff and ambiance and delicious steaks that we enjoy. We've celebrated numerous special occasions there. It’s exceptional to frequent a place for more than a decade, and a good portion of the staff has taken care of you throughout the entire span. \n5. Ale Emporium (8617 Allisonville Road) Sometimes we just like to throw on a hat and watch our favorite sports teams on one of the many big screens. With the best wings in town (we like the “no way” sauce on the side), a huge variety of beer and no children allowed (21 and older), need we say more?  //indy.st/2kanIvE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:00:14.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
