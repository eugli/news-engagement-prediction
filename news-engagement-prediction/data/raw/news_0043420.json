The university in Highland Heights said it will partner on clinical practice with Edgewood-based St. Elizabeth Healthcare, TriHealth’s Good Samaritan Hospital in University Heights and Bethesda North Hospital in Montgomery as well as Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Avondale. Dr. William Terry Ray, founding director of Northern Kentucky University's nurse… more Courtesy of NKU Students might also will be able to practice their skills in NKU’s simulation labs within the Albright Health Center. A $97 million Health Innovation Center under construction on the campus of NKU is to open in 2018 . The 36-month curriculum will encompass 106 semester hours and culminate in a doctor of nursing practice degree for nurse anesthesia specialization. Graduates will be eligible to take the national certification exam of the National Board of Certification and Recertification of Nurse Anesthetists and to assume the role of an advanced practice registered nurse as a certified registered nurse anesthetist. The NKU program was developed and will be directed by Dr. William Terry Ray , former director of the University of Cincinnati’s nurse anesthesia major. The first cohort of students will begin taking classes on May 8. NKU will begin accepting applications on June 1 for admission to the next cohort. NKU officials said the program within the fast-growing College of Health Professions will help fill both a local and national shortage of certified registered nurse anesthetists. I previously reported that the health care industry is growing more quickly than Greater Cincinnati’s overall economy, but local colleges graduate only two-thirds of the number of trained workers that will be needed in coming years. NKU, which has a total of about 15,000 students, is the third-largest university in Greater Cincinnati, according to Business Courier research . About 120 universities in the nation have a nurse anesthesia program, NKU said. For information on the NKU nursing program, call 859-572-7964 or click here .
