The March issue of Vogue (on newsstands February 21) is devoted to differences in beauty — what the magazine calls “The Great Beauty Shakeup” — and features models of varying ethnicities lined up on a Malibu beach. Liu Wen, Ashley Graham , Adwoa Aboah, Vittoria Ceretti, Imaan Hammam, Gigi Hadid , and Kendall Jenner . The problem: Although all seven girls are breathtaking, some critics say it’s not diverse enough and that nearly all have itty-bitty bodies, while others noted that Hadid’s hand is partially covering the torso of plus-size model Graham, prompting fans to accuse the magazine of concealing her body.\nSocial media outcry was swift. “Ugh. Do better Vogue,” wrote one Instagram follower. “No chocolate sistas SMH,” wrote another. And: “I guess we can grace these covers only if we blend in but standing out is not an option.” Added Instagram user beautifully_anxious: “I love this, but I’d love to see more plus size models on this line up and darker girls.. just saying.”\nOn Twitter, one user asked , “Am I the only one who thinks it’s hilarious how they’ve used basically the same woman, just slightly less white?” Another criticized the magazine for featuring an Asian-American woman on the cover for first time — with six other models.\nVogue did not return Yahoo Style’s request for comment; however, on Wednesday, Graham defended the cover, posting on Instagram , “I chose to pose like that. No one told me to do anything.”\nAshley Graham in the March 2017 issue of Vogue. (Photo Credit: Inez and Vinoodh/Vogue) More The Vogue cover is well meaning, but it’s not the first time fashion magazines have been under fire for possible airbrushing and homogenous-looking models. In 2015, Kerry Washington appeared on the cover of InStyle with noticeably lighter skin. In 2013, plus-size actress Melissa McCarthy was photographed for the cover of Elle while concealed in a trench coat — a departure from the fleshier covers of the past (although McCartney told E! News that she had chosen the coat). And in 2010, African-American actress Gabourey Sidibe covered an issue of Elle from the chest up with a lighter-looking skin tone .\nHere’s hoping fashion gets more inclusive in the year ahead.\nRead More: \nAshley Graham Is Breaking Gender Barriers and Promoting Body Positivity in V Magazine \nThe Tommy x Gigi Show Hasn’t Even Started Yet, and the Clothes Are Already Selling Out \n13 Inspirational Quotes From Ashley Graham \nFollow Yahoo Style on Instagram , Facebook , and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:36:23.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
