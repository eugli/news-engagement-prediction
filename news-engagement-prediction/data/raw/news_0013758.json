The players will show their tens of millions of fans the true face of Israel. We are leading a campaign against the delegitimization of Israel and part of this campaign is to arrange visits of celebrities in different fields, including sports.”Among those visiting will be former Super Bowl champions Michael Bennett and Cliff Avril, as well as Bennett’s brother Martellus, who was set to play for the New England Patriots in Sunday’s Super Bowl against the Atlanta Falcons.Others in the group include: Delanie Walker, Mychal Kendricks, Kenny Stills, Cameron Jordan, Calais Campbell, Carlos Hyde, Dan Williams and Justin Forsett.The delegation is scheduled to hold an exhibition game against Israel’s national team in Jerusalem on February 18.“Football players are a source of inspiration for the entire US population. I’m sure that after their experiences in the country, they will become loyal tourism ambassadors of Israel,” said Tourism Minister Yariv Levin. Relevant to your professional network?
