Source: Perform O'Keefe bags 12 as Aussies demolish India \nO'Keefe finished with stunning match-figures of 12-70 in Pune, piloting the tourists to a 333-run victory on day three of the four-Test series opener. \nThe 32-year-old match haul is statistically the greatest performance by a visiting spinner in India, making Warnie eat his words from a few days earlier. O'Keefe was huge. Image: Twitter \nWarne, speaking on Star Sports on Friday morning, questioned why selectors didn't pick Mitchell Swepson or Ashton Agar ahead of O'Keefe. \n\"O'Keefe is the safe option because you know he's not going to bowl much rubbish,\" Warne said. \n\"You don't see him as a huge danger with big-turning deliveries. He bowls tight. Close VIDEO Kohli's very costly leave. Source: Fox Sports Kohli's very costly leave \n\"In these conditions, guys like Swepson and Agar could have been more of a danger option.\" \nWarne also criticised Steve Smith's decision to hand O'Keefe the new ball in India's first innings. \n\"When you first start a session you want to set the tone and put pressure on the Indian batsmen and, without trying to be too harsh on Steve O'Keefe, this is the weakest of the Australian bowlers,\" Warne said. Warnie eats his words. Image: Getty \n\"You can understand Steve Smith trying to give him confidence, but there is a time and a place for Steve O'Keefe to get his confidence, right now is the time for Australia to ram home the advantage with Nathan Lyon I believe at that end.\" \nEven after O'Keefe sparked a monumental Indian collapse of 7-11, Warne said O'Keefe \"wasn't bowling that well early.\" \n\"In his wildest dreams I don't think he imagined it could have gone that well, none of us did, but well done to him.\" \nThe social media reaction to Warnie's critique has been incredible: Hey great man @ShaneWarne , do us a favour and write @CollingwoodFC off for the premiership!!

Trouncing India in India, with spin. â€” Ashok Lalla (@ashoklalla) February 25, 2017 \nIt isn't the first time Warne has questioned O'Keefe's place in the team. \n\"To me he is more of a white-ball bowler,\" Warne said after O'Keefe was added to the squad for last month's SCG Test.
