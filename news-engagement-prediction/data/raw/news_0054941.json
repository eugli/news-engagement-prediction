I thought ‘this petition I’ve started could save a child’s life’ and it wasn’t getting any more signatures.\n“So when it finally passed the 100,000 mark I was really excited.\nMark Bridger was convicted of her murder (Photo: Dyfed Powys Police) “It just meant maybe they might listen to us. I know there’s a long way to go, but it’s another small step.\n“We’re hopeful it will get the law out and even if it saves one child’s life we’ll prevent another family having to go through what we’ve been through.”\nBridger was jailed for life in May 2013 after being found guilty of the youngster’s abduction and murder in what the judge said was a “sexually motivated” attack.\nDuring his trial, it emerged he possessed 500 sexually explicit images of children on his computer.\n*This Morning continues on ITV1 weekdays at 10.30am\n Celebs Newsletter Follow @MirrorTV Subscribe to our Celebs newsletter Enter email Subscribe More On April Jones Murder Life sentence Crime Alcoholism This Morning", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "https://www.facebook.com/dailymirrortv", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201608/1557/4221396001_5076932850001_5076922617001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorTV", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2440/4221396001_5332367292001_5332363296001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/32/4221396001_5332247842001_5332213579001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3680/4221396001_5332328515001_5332324615001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201701/2562/4221396001_5271349299001_5271342369001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1480/4221396001_5332291476001_5332262262001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1832/4221396001_5332300491001_5332290594001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-22T13:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:45:44.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
