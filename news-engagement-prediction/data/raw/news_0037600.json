While toddlers played and babies slept nearby, their moms sat on the floor and plotted how they might mobilize into a force for good in the community. It was an activist play date, they called it. \nIt was the beginning of Do Good Indy , a Facebook group organized last fall to spread goodwill and good vibes throughout the city, lifting up marginalized populations along the way. \nThey women even developed a vision statement: \"Through coordinated giving drives and opportunities for deeper connections, Do Good Indy will provide a direct positive impact by championing both the need for support and acceptance of vulnerable populations as a critical component in a civilized society.\" \nChristie Koester, a mother of two toddlers who works from home, is one of five Indianapolis moms leading the charge for kindness as a way to fight fear in parts of this city and others around the country. \nIt started in response to the rancor of the last presidential election, but it's not about politics, she insists; it's about people. \"We are strictly nonpartisan. We accept anyone who wants to do good in Indy.\" \nTo that end, Do Good Indy has been busy the past few months, collecting and donating carload after carload of clothing, toiletries and books to local organizations serving vulnerable populations, including the Immigrant Welcome Center , Exodus Refugee , the Julian Center , which supports abused women, and Damien Center , which helps people with HIV/AIDS. \n\"There are so many amazing organizations doing amazing work in Indy,\" Koester said. By hosting supply drives for some of them, Do Good Indy also aims to connect people to these organizations, whether to volunteer or write a check. \n\"Glorified middle women\" is how she describes the group, working to make it easy for people to clean out their closets or garages and donate to an organization maybe they haven't heard of before.

The Southside center was seeing more people coming in needing referrals for basic supplies. \n\"We needed more help, more hands,\" he said. \"They are doing a very great thing for us and for immigrants and refugees.\" \nLast month, the group collected coats and toys and set up a giveaway at the center, attracting more than 40 families. \nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, 8.3 percent of Indianapolis residents are foreign-born, and in 11.8 percent of homes, a language other than English is spoken. \nThe Indianapolis metro population grew by 15.2 percent in the past decade due in large part to an influx of foreign-born residents. \nNearly half of the newcomers to Indianapolis come from Latin American countries. The top five countries of origin for immigrants to Indiana as of 2012 were Burma, Mexico, India, China and the Philippines. Mom came from Cuba \nEmily Miller is the daughter of a first-generation immigrant from Cuba. Her mom came to the U.S. with her parents as a toddler in 1960. After weeks in a refugee camp in Miami, the family of five was resettled in Chicago with help from organizations that provided furniture, clothing and toiletries, the same things Miller and the Do Good Indy group provide for people in need here. \n\"My mom still keeps in touch with the family that helped them when they moved to Chicago,\" Miller said. \"Growing up with that background, being able to continue that cycle of helping people resettle means a lot to me.\" \nOn Wednesday morning, the five Do Good Indy founders, a few of their friends and about a dozen babies and toddlers crowded into Katie Swaney's home, where a stack of donations was waiting to be sorted.
