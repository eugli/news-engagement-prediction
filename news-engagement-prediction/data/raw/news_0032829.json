New product claims to bust through border blocks TurboBeacon uses its own Wi-Fi connnection to gain access to U.S. Netflix By Sophia Harris, CBC News Posted: Feb 12, 2017 5:00 AM ET Last Updated: Feb 12, 2017 5:00 AM ET Taylor Campbell shows off her company's new device called TurboBeacon. She claims it can bypass Netflix's border blocks. (Turbo VPN) \nSophia Harris Business reporter sophia.harris@cbc.ca \nSophia Harris has worked as a CBC video journalist across the country, covering everything from the start of the annual lobster fishery in Yarmouth, N.S., to potash prices in Saskatchewan. She now has found a good home at the business unit in Toronto where she produces for national TV news and writes and shoots and edits video for CBC.ca. Twitter: @sophiaharrisCBC How to cut down your TV, phone and internet bills in perfectly legal ways \nA Canadian-founded company claims it has found a way to bust through Netflix's border blocks. Its secret weapon — an electronic device called TurboBeacon . \nAfter Netflix launched a big crackdown on border hopping early last year, many Canadians found they could no longer stream content restricted to other countries. That meant no more access to shows only available in Netflix's vast U.S. library — including favourites like CSI Miami and Nurse Jackie. \nThe company Turbo VPN claims its TurboBeacon contains technology that makes it \"unstoppable,\" enabling customers to once again freely access U.S. Netflix. \"Can't block the Beacon,\" it promises. \nCBC News has not independently tested the product. Try and try again \nTurbo VPN was founded in Canada and is now incorporated in Barbados, but still has an office in Burlington, Ont. It also offers an unblocking service called TurboFlix which provides users with the technology needed to hide their location and sneak across virtual borders to watch content not available in Canada. \nFollowing the Netflix crackdown, TurboFlix, like many unblocking services , had trouble helping its subscribers access Netflix in other countries. \n\"Rather than throwing in the towel, we put our heads together, drank lots of coffee, and came up with TurboBeacon,\" said Taylor Campbell, general manager of TurboFlix, in an email to CBC News. Customers connect the TurboBeacon to their wireless router and their chosen streaming device. It then uses its own Wi-Fi network. (Turbo VPN) \nThe product is a small box, a bit bigger than a deck of cards. \nYou connect it to your wireless router and then connect your streaming device like Apple TV to a Wi-Fi network called TurboBeacon. The company says you can then easily watch U.S. restricted content using streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and HBO Now. \nCampbell says TurboBeacon geo-locates the user to the U.S., just like unblocking services do. But she says how it actually works is \"fundamentally different.\" She wouldn't elaborate further, telling CBC News that the device uses proprietary technology. \n\"A big part of why we are so confident, and haven't been blocked, is due to the private and secure nature of this technology,\" said Campbell, who is based in Burlington. \nCustomers can order the device online for $24.95 US. They pay a monthly subscription of $7.95 US for as long as they use the box. That's on top of your streaming service charge. \nCBC News asked Netflix for comment about TurboBeacon. The California-based company did not respond to our request. Customers give it a try \nLouise Cowden from Hamilton, Ont., bought a TurboBeacon and says she's happy with it. She previously used unblocking technology to access Netflix's U.S library. \nBut following the crackdown, Cowden found that she was frequently blocked from watching U.S.-restricted shows like Criminal Minds and Sons of Anarchy . \n\"Every now and again I log on to watch something and it wouldn't work,\" she says. \"It was becoming more of a pain than anything else.\" This is the message many Netflix customers now see when they try to watch shows restricted to other countries. (Allana Mayer) \nCowden says TurboBeacon was easy to set up and that she can now enjoy easy access to Netflix's U.S. library. \n\"It's awesome,\" she says. \nCowden also has no qualms about using the TurboBeacon to defy Netflix's geo-restrictions. The company is enforcing its border blocks because it has signed country-exclusive licensing agreements for much of its content. \n\"If it's out there for one country to watch, why am I not able to watch it?\" says Cowden. \"It just doesn't make much sense to me.\" HBO tells Game of Thrones pirates it's easy to pay for show \nUmar Ahmed says he has also tried the TurboBeacon and found that he could easily access U.S. Netflix. But he says one disadvantage is that the system, which uses its own Wi-Fi network, can be slow at times. \n\"You kind of get hit if you're trying to stream a lot of HD content,\" says Ahmed who lives in Oakville, Ont. Others want in on the game \nCampbell wouldn't reveal sales figures. But she says, since the company started shipping the TurboBeacon in August, interest has grown, mainly from customers in Canada, Australia, and the U.K. \nThe device may soon face some competition. A Vancouver company, Betternet Technologies, appears to be set to launch a similar product called Betterspot . Betterspot is another device that's being promoted with the claim that it can bust through Netflix's border blocks. (Betternet Technologies) \nThe device is also being promoted as a way to bypass Netflix blocks and freely access content \" without regional blackouts or restrictions.\" \nBetternet Technologies has launched an Indiegogo campaign to raise funds for its project. People can pre-order a device with a one-year subscription for $135 US. \nThe company did not respond to questions from CBC News. Will Netflix stop the 'unstoppable'? \nToronto tech analyst Patrick O'Rourke says he's never tried either of the devices but suspects their one advantage is that they have their own Wi-Fi connection. So when Netflix tries to block the service, the unblocking service can quickly find workarounds. \n\"The developers of the device can push out updates automatically,\" suggests O'Rourke, a writer for the tech site MobileSyrup. \"They're able to stay one step ahead.\" \nBut he cautions that this may not always be the case. He points out that Netflix found a way to crack down on many unblocking services. So the day may come when it finds a way to stop an \"unstoppable\" device like the TurboBeacon, he says. \n\"It's just a matter of Netflix catching up to them,\" says O'Rourke, who believes the devices are already on Netflix's radar.
