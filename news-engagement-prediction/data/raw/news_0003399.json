he could outsmart Trump Rita Panahi: Why you have to admire Trump’s powers of perception James Campbell : President Donald Trump is not a normal politician Trump ‘doesn’t care about Australia’ FORMER Foreign Minister Bob Carr believes the highly charged telephone call between US President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is “healthy” for Australia.\nSpeaking on ABC TV’s 7.30 , Mr Carr said Mr Trump’s rudeness on the call between the two leaders and his “highly offensive tweet” that followed was a reminder that Australia was simply another alliance partner with the USA.\nMr Carr also said President Trump’s “unprecedented rude treatment” was also a reminder of Australia’s status as an independent nation.\n“This is a healthy thing for Australia, the response of Donald Trump to the phone call made by our PM,” Mr Carr told 7.30 host Stan Grant.\n“I think it’s a reminder to Australians that America is different, America has changed. America is declaring it’s America first from now on. That’s a Quote: from the inauguration speech by the President. And I just think it’s healthy if we absorb that fact.\nEveryone supports this alliance in Australia, there’s a consensus on that. It’s one of the pillars of Australian foreign policy but it’s not the be all and end all of Australia’s international character. That’s the point I’m making.”\nmedia_camera Former Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr says the spat between Donald Trump and Malcolm Turnbull is “healthy” for Australia. Picture: Colin Murty The Australian\nMr Carr, who served as Labor’s Minster for Foreign Affairs from March 2012 to September 2013, said Australia did not have a special relationship with American as many assumed.\n“Stan, take that point on the notion that somehow we’ve got the most special relationship with America in the world,” the former NSW Premier said.\n“I could easily give you a list of 20 countries that hold that belief. America is the proud possessor of an alliance system, it’s one of the things that distinguishes the US and advantages it over any other contenders for global leadership. And it’s useful if Australians understand that Poland, for example, would regard itself as having every bit a special a relationship with the US as Australia. That Barack Obama on his farewell tour to Europe was talking about Germany as America’s most important partner in the world. In Britain, the Trans Atlantic Alliance is regarded as the apostles’ creed.\n“We have to be practical about the alliance. It is not the only path of our international personality. And if this rude dismissal of the representations by an Australian PM altogether legitimate representations by President Trump serves to remind Australians of that\ngreat truth, then it’s a good and healthy thing.”\nUS PRESIDENT Donald Trump hit back on Twitter after details of his shocking phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were revealed, slamming the refugee deal as ‘dumb’.\nIn the scathing tweet, he said: “Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!”\nThe tweet was posted around 11pm Washington time and once again throws the refugee resettlement deal into limbo.\nDo you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 It comes after a report in The Washington Post , where senior US officials briefed on the conversation said President Trump hung up on Mr Turnbull after 25 minutes, when their call was meant to be an hour long.\nPresident Trump reportedly criticised Mr Turnbull over his refu­gee agreement formerly made with president Barack Obama, and boasted about his electoral college win.\nAfter a series of phone calls made on Sunday, Mr Turnbull was the last call President Trump took.\n“This was the worst call by far,” he is Quote: d as saying.\n“This is the worst deal ever.”\nIt is understood the President complained that he was “going to get killed” politically and accused Australia of seeking to export the “next Boston bombers”.\nAt one point, Turnbull suggested that the two leaders move on from their impasse over refugees to discuss the conflict in Syria and other pressing foreign issues.\nBut President Trump demurred and ended the call, making it far shorter than his conversations with Shinzo Abe of Japan, Angela Merkel of Germany, François Hollande of France or Putin of Russia.\nCNN’s White House Correspondent Jim Acosta also tweeted today that according to one of his sources, President Trump pulled the phone away from ear and wanted to get off the call.\nSky News Australia sources also claimed today that President Trump “yelled” at Mr Turnbull in the heated exchange.\nDuring call with Australian PM on refugees, Trump pulled phone away from ear and says he wants off call, which ends abruptly per source.\n— Jim Acosta (@Acosta) February 2, 2017 media_camera US President Donald Trump speaks on the phone with Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, alongside Chief Strategist Steve Bannon and National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Picture: AFP TURNBULL WON’T REVEAL DETAILS\nMalcolm Turnbull has refused to go into details of his discussion with President Trump on Sunday morning but denied one aspect of the reports this afternoon.\n“The report that the president hung up is not correct, the call ended courteously,” he told 2GB radio this afternoon.\nHe backed this statement up during an interview with 3AW radio, saying he was “disappointed” about the leak but some information had not been accurate.\n“It was a 25-minute call, it covered a number of issues but the bulk of the time was spent on the refugee resettlement deal,” he said.\nThe Prime Minister also responded to President Trump’s tweet, saying the facts were President Trump had given an assurance during their conversation that the deal would go ahead, White House press secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that in a briefing on Wednesday and the US embassy in Canberra reconfirmed it this afternoon.\n“I do stand up for Australia but I can assure you the call was courteous,” Mr Turnbull said.\nHe said the deal had always proceeded on the basis that the United States would do security checks on any individual that would be resettled in the US, as was their right.\nMr Turnbull also refused to comment on the conversation earlier at a press conference.\n“I’m not going to comment on a conversation between myself and the President of the United States other than what we have said publicly,” he said.\n“You can surely understand the reasons for that. I appreciate your interest, but it’s better that these things - these conversations are conducted candidly, frankly, privately. If you see reports of them, I’m not going to add to them.”\nTurnbull - I'm not going to comment on conversation with Trump 2:26 Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull refuses to comment on his conversation with US President Donald Trump amid reports of disagreements and Trump hanging up the phone\nFebruary 2nd 2017 13 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Turnbull - I'm not going to comment on conversation with Trump The details come as the White House and US State Department are sending mixed messages on whether President Trump will still honour a deal with Australia to resettle refugees in the US.\nToday, the White House confirmed President Trump has not made a final decision on whether to honour a refugee deal with Australia.\n. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump - speaking with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull from the Oval Office. pic.twitter.com/6rDjoygXDD\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) January 28, 2017 DEAL OR NO DEAL? A spokesperson for the US Embassy in Canberra said this afternoon President Trump would honour the refugee agreement.\n“President Trump’s decision to honour the refugee agreement has not changed and Spokesman Spicer’s comments stand,” the spokesperson said.\n“This was just confirmed to the State Department from the WH and on to this embassy at 13.15 Canberra time.”\nBut in a statement provided to ABC today, the White House press office confirmed President Trump might still torpedo the deal made between Mr Turnbull and President Obama.\n“The President is still considering whether or not he will move forward with this deal at this time,” the statement read.\nMeanwhile, a statement from the State Department appears to contradict the message coming out of the White House.\n“Out of respect for close ties to our Australian ally and friend, we will honour the agreement to accept some refugees from resettlement centres on Nauru and Papua New Guinea,” a State Department official said in a statement provided to the ABC.\n“Any refugees coming to US shores would only come to the United States in accordance with the recently signed executive order.”\nMr Turnbull yesterday brushed off reports from an unnamed White House source that the agreement was not yet finalised.\nmedia_camera US President Donald Trump still on the phone with Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Picture: AFP TRUMP WAS ‘UPSET’ BY THE DEAL\nOne of the journalists behind The Washington Post report, Philip Rucker, told Sky News Australia that his sources told him that President Trump “got angry on the call” with Mr Turnbull.\n“He blasted the Prime Minister,” he said.\n“The Prime Minister and President Trump agreed that the number of these refugees would be allowed to be part of the screening process.”\nHe also said the President was “upset” by the agreement and said it was his “intention” to keep it, which gave him room to negotiate on it.\nMr Rucker also told the ABC he and his colleague Greg Miller had been briefed on some of the exact quotations from the Trump-Turnbull phone call by senior US officials.\nMr Rucker said sources had told him President Trump’s phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin was much longer.\n. @PhilipRucker speaks to @vanOnselenP about his report for @washingtonpost on @POTUS blasting @TurnbullMalcom pic.twitter.com/oD04XKJs8M\n— Sky News Australia (@SkyNewsAust) February 2, 2017 President Trump “doesn’t really care” that Australia has been a long-term ally of the US, he is more concerned about his domestic refugee policy, Mr Rucker said.\n“The thing you have to understand about Donald Trump is that he is not a natural diplomat, he is not a politician,” he told the ABC.\n“He has a career in real estate, in business and deal-making, and he ran for President as somebody who was going to disrupt the world order.\n. @gregpmiller : @TurnbullMalcolm 'taken off guard' by @POTUS 's tone during their terse discussion over the US-Australia refugee deal pic.twitter.com/m4r2dGoJvJ\n— Sky News Australia (@SkyNewsAust) February 2, 2017 “He was going to make changes and he was going to blow up the system, literally, and disrupt what he sees as a world order that is failing the world and making it more dangerous and less safe.\n“And so he doesn’t really care so much that Australia is an ally over many, many years.\n“What he cares about is the refugee policy that ... he views as dangerous for the United States.\n“So he didn’t let diplomatic niceties get in the way of how he felt about that refugee policy.”\nASSURANCES ON RESETTLEMENT DEAL Mr Turnbull told reporters in Canberra yesterday President Trump had given an assurance that the deal would go ahead in their phone conversation on Sunday.\n“The Trump administration has committed to progress with the arrangements to honour the deal, if you like, that was entered into with the Obama administration,” Mr Turnbull said.\n“That was the assurance the president gave me when we spoke on the weekend.”\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said on Wednesday morning the deal to resettle refugees held on Nauru and Papua New Guinea’s Manus Island would be honoured but the individuals would be subject to “extreme vetting”.\n“The deal specifically deals with 1250 people that are mostly in Papua New Guinea being held,” he said.\n“Those people, part of the deal, is they have to be vetted in the same manner that we are doing now.”\nmedia_camera President Donald Trump up close while on the phone with Prime Minister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull in the Oval Office of the White House. Picture: AAP LABOR: TURNBULL MUST CONFIRM OR DENY\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten told media today: “I think Mr Turnbull needs to confirm or deny the accuracy of that report.\n“He made it clear that he had a constructive discussion and that the refugee deal, which Labor supports, was on track.\n“But now it appears another different version of the same conversation has emerged. I just say to Mr Turnbull, ‘talk straight to the Australian people. Tell us what’s going on’.”\n“We want to see the refugee deal happen, but clearly President Trump and his people are saying one thing happened in this conversation, which is completely at odds with what Prime Minister Turnbull has told the Australian people. They both can’t be right and I think it’s in the interests of the Australian people for Mr Turnbull just to be straight with the people and tell us what’s really going on.”\nmedia_camera Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull under fire today about his call to President Trump. Picture: AAP HOW TURNBULL DESCRIBED THE CALL\nOn Monday, Mr Turnbull told media in Canberra that he had had a “constructive” call with President Trump on Sunday.\n“The President and I acknowledged the already strong and deep relationship between the United States and Australia and committed to making it stronger still,” Mr Turnbull said.\n“We also recommitted our common determination, our united purpose in defeating ISIL which continues to have an impact - a dangerous, terrorist impact - not just in the Middle East but right around the world, including in our own countries.\n“We discussed the importance of border security and the threat of illegal and irregular migration, and recognised that it is vital that every nation is able to control who comes across its borders.\n“We discussed the very principles that I raised at the United Nations last year when I made the point there that our strong border protection - which the Coalition Government, under the leadership of PM Abbott in 2013, continued under my Government and enhanced under my Government - our strong border protection gives Australians confidence in the immigration system, gives them confidence in our humanitarian programs, underpins the commitment in our - the most successful multicultural society in the world.\nmedia_camera Malcolm Turnbull assured Australians the deal was still on yesterday. Picture: Kym Smith\n“We also discussed the resettlement arrangement of refugees from Nauru and Manus, which had been entered into with the previous administration, and I thank President Trump for his commitment to honour that existing agreement.”\nMr Turnbull and Immigration Minister Peter Dutton announced the “one-off” deal to resettle an undisclosed number of asylum seekers in Australia’s offshore detention centres just days after President Trump was elected in November.\nPresident Obama and Mr Turnbull had made the agreement earlier in 2016.\nIt has been touted as a way to close the detention centres on Nauru and Manus Island.\nTURNBULL WON’T ATTACK TRUMP BAN Mr Turnbull has been criticised for his refusal to comment on President Trump’s executive order to ban the citizens from several countries from entering the US.\nWhile other world leaders including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Theresa May had publicly criticised the travel ban, Mr Turnbull said Australia’s national interest was best protected by giving private “frank advice” to “our number one ally”.\n“When I have frank advice to give to an American president, I give it privately, as good friends should, as wise prime ministers do, when they want to ensure they are best able to protect Australians and Australians’ national interest,” Mr Turnbull said.\n“I don’t comment on American policy publicly. My job is to get results for Australia.”\nOpposition leader Bill Shorten said an Australian leader needed to stand up for the nation’s values.\n“I absolutely support the American alliance but let’s be clear, sometimes there are issues where if the nation’s leader is silent, it can be interpreted as agreement,” Mr Shorten said on Tuesday.\n“If the Germans can speak up, if the English can speak up, if the Canadians can speak up, then why are we silent?”\nmedia_camera Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and former US President Barack Obama revealed the deal last November.
