But coach Rick Barnes knows it will be a much different story when the rematch is held Tuesday in Lexington. \n“We talked about it with the team yesterday,” Barnes said Monday. “When we won here we were coming off a good win against Mississippi State and we were at home. Now we’re coming off a tough loss and we’re on the road. So our mindset is really important, being able to get on to the next game.” \nTennessee is reeling from Saturday’s 76-75 loss to Georgia, blowing a 14-point lead at Thompson-Boling Arena. It’s been a damaging trend as the Volunteers held leads of 19, 15, 13 and 13 only to lose to Mississippi State, North Carolina, Arkansas and Ole Miss, respectively. \n“Win or lose, you have to let it go this time of year and get ready for the next game,” Barnes said. “Hopefully, we’ll do that. Our players know full well what we have to do to compete at the level we need to compete at in Lexington.” \nKentucky (20-5, 10-2 SEC) hosts Tennessee (14-11, 6-6) at 7 p.m. at Rupp Arena. Barnes is wondering aloud if the Wildcats might try to replicate Georgia’s success as guard J.J. Frazier torched Tennessee for 20 of his 29 points in the second-half comeback. \n“I’m sure they’re looking at the tape seeing what J.J. Frazier did to us off ball screens and thinking they can do the same thing,” Barnes said. “But they have a number of players that can take over a game. \n“ Malik Monk leads the SEC in scoring, De'Aaron Fox leads the SEC in assists,” Barnes said. “You saw what Bam Adebayo did to us here, I think he had four or five dunks. Isaiah Briscoe is one of the great competitors you’ll play against. So they have a number of guys who can have spectacular nights against you.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:13:17.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
