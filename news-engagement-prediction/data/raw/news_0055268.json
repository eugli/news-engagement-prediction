The ad featured a severed finger, chopped in little pieces and doused in seasoning. Let's just say it wasn't even the grossest of the bunch. Look, it's too early— we'll just link to them . Trump is expected to roll back protections for transgender students \nThe Trump administration is expected to reverse an Obama initiative that gives transgender students the right to use bathrooms that match their gender identity , according to multiple reports .

Send NASA is closer to locating a second Earth \nThanks to new insights from the Spitzer, an infrared space telescope, NASA has discovered seven Earth-sized exoplanets , that is, planets orbiting a star outside our own solar system. This particular collection of planets orbits a dwarf star called the Trappist-1, which is 40 light years away. \nHere's a video on what we know about Trappist-1 by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory: \nBut while our telescope technology has advanced, allowing us to see far reaches of the universe, we don't yet have vehicles that would get us there in a reasonable time frame. To get to any of these planets with our current vehicles would take about 44 million years. NASA has already released a poster about this planetary system, imagining a future in which we might visit the planets for a vacation. \nThat said, the scientists at a NASA briefing today believe that it is very likely that there is life elsewhere in the solar system. Verizon 5G trials are coming to 11 cities but don’t get too excited yet \nThis summer, Verizon will kick off the largest U.S. trial yet for 5G wireless, offering it as a replacement for wired Internet in 11 cities. Data speeds could be 10 to 100 times faster than current cellular connections. \nThe telco industry has been hyping 5G's transformative potential for years, with promises of ubiquitous, blazing-fast connectivity. Verizon's trial is much more modest–it basically lets the company install internet in homes and businesses without running fiber to each building–and CNet notes that it will only cover several thousand customers. True 5G wireless isn't even an industry standard yet, and widespread adoption faces major obstacles . JN 02.22.17 | 3 hours ago Is Slack safe for journalists? \nIf you work in media (or most other tech-oriented jobs), chances are you've come across Slack once or twice. It's an easy way to chat and collaborate with fellow employees. But with the future of press freedom growing murkier every day, are chatroom apps like Slack really the best way for journalists to communicate? The short answer is: If you care about things like security and confidentiality, probably not. Read my latest feature to find out why . CGW 02.22.17 | 3 hours ago Now your Instagram posts can be mini-albums of photos and videos \nEver since Instagram added its Snapchat-inspired Instagram Stories last August, it's concentrated on building out that feature , which has become a runaway hit . Today, however, it's announcing a major upgrade to Instagram in its classic form: the ability to upload multiple images and videos—up to 10 of them—in one album-like post. \nThis being Instagram, the new feature has been implemented in a straightforward fashion: a new button lets you select multiple items . Once you've made your choices, you can apply a filter to all of them en masse or one at a time; only the classic Instagram square format is currently supported. People who view your feed can swipe to see them one by one, like a slideshow. Though there are some conceptual similarities to Stories, which also involve multiple pieces of media, there's nothing particularly Snapchatty about this new capability—especially since everything stays available forever rather than going poof after 24 hours.
