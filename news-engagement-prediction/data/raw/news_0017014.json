He later accused mainstream Democrats of inciting some protesters. \nAdvertisement   Denying this, Ms. Stewart-Cousins suggested that the defectors were pursuing perks like larger offices, staffs and committee memberships. Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, the leader of the independent Democrats, said on Monday that the idea that his group was siding with Mr. Trump “couldn’t be further from the truth,” adding that his members had voiced opposition to many Trump policies. Any assertion that his members were merely after perks were, he said, nonsense. “I think it’s a real problem, and I think it’s sort of a problem with leadership, that all of the sudden when a Jesse Hamilton or a Jose Peralta or a Marisol Alcantara want to be part of the Independent Democratic Conference because they want to get things done and they want to get things from their districts, somehow it’s some unsavory trade,” he said. Ms. Alcantara has said that she joined the conference after it offered support that was not coming from the mainstream Democrats. Over the weekend, she called the backlash racist: She and Mr. Peralta are Hispanic, and Mr. Hamilton is black. They also represent districts in New York City that are more liberal than those of the five other members of the conference. While no protests against Ms. Alcantara have emerged, constituents have met with her to press her to fight for liberal legislation on abortion rights and education funding, among other issues. “People have sort of this nascent political awakening happening now after President Trump was elected, and they’re learning these things, and they’re really unhappy about it,” said Lisa DellAquila, an Inwood lawyer and activist who has urged Ms. Alcantara to join the mainstream Democrats. “I think she’s got a lot to prove to her district.” One of Ms. Alcantara’s opponents in last year’s Democratic primary, Robert Jackson, may challenge her in 2018, according to a person close to him. Asked on Monday whether he had heard any complaints about his defection, Mr. Hamilton said no. He then began listing his accomplishments, like stints on the school board and his local block association. \nAdvertisement “I’ve been on the ground for a long period of time and getting things done,” he said. He hastened to add, “I have problems with the Trump administration.” A version of this article appears in print on February 7, 2017, on Page A18 of the New York edition with the headline: Breakaway Democrats Feel Trump Backlash.
