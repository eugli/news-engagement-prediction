Sergeant Brian Wood speaks for the first time on lies spun about troops in Iraq by Phil Shiner ITV Sergeant Brian Wood led his men into hand to hand combat in the Battle of Danny Boy in Iraq in 2004 ITV Today he spoke on Good Morning Britain about what he and other British troops have been through since ITV 11 He said lawyer Phil Shiner being struck off for concocting lies about troops committing atrocities against Iraqi soldiers was a 'small win' \nAppearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain, an emotional Sgt Wood said yesterday's decision by finding the tank-chasing legal aid lawyer guilty of a dozen misconduct charges during a shameful spree that saw him personally pocket millions was a \"small win\" but had come too little too late. \nThe “human rights” solicitor, 59, cost taxpayers tens of millions by pursuing concocted claims on behalf of Iraqis. On Thursday he was condemned by his profession’s watchdog. \nSpeaking on the programme today, Sgt Wood said: \"It was a mixture of emotions. I was shaking with the adrenaline. It is a small win in the bigger picture because the damage has been done and will always stay. It helps to know now that there has been something put in place to stop this happening to our troops going forward.\" ITV In the emotional TV interview he spoke for the first time about the battle and what happened when they returned home ITV The war hero said he and others were 'punished' by Shiner's dogged pursuit of them with the made-up claims Simon Jones/The Sun 11 Human Rights solicitor Phil Shiner has been struck off following his claims against Brit war heroes \nThe soldier said Phil Shiner 's cooked up stories have had a devastating effect on his pals' careers and many have since suffered Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). \nOn May 14, 2004, Sgt Wood, then a commander aged just 23, led his men into battle in \"probably the most violent situation in contemporary warfare\". \nHe said the enemy were close, and were heavily dug in, when he got the command to leave the 33 tonne armoured vehicle they had some relative protection in and face the militia in hand to hand combat - the first time troops had had to do so in such a situation since the Second World War. \nHe said: \"In my last position before we went into the main position there were 15-20 militia with serious weapon systems engaging us and I realised these were human beings but I had to do my job. \n\"As we went in it changed from full violence to a number of them surrendering very quickly.

I took on young kids' sports coaching, I cycled across America to raise funds for injured soldiers. But he punished us. In a way, no-one will ever know what he did to us.\" \nLast night Shiner, who claimed he was too ill to attend the probe, was facing ruin. ITV Sgt Wood said the battle had left him scarred and the 'damage has been done' by Shiner's lies Reuters After Shiner was found guilty by his professions' watchdog, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon slammed him for 'making soldiers' lives a misery' Getty Images 11 Lawsuits pursued by Shiner against Brit troops were found to be 'wholly baseless' and 'calculated lies' for which he pocketed \nHe has been ordered to pay £250,000 towards the costs of the hearing. And the Ministry of Defence and Legal Aid Authority are free to demand their cash back. \nThat is just a fraction of the bill he landed taxpayers after his fake claims of murder and torture fuelled two massive inquiries. \nOne, the Iraq Historical Allegations Team (Ihat), has cost £57million to date probing 3,281 allegations against vets. \nNot a single prosecution has resulted — after lawsuits Shiner pursued were rumbled as “wholly baseless” and “calculated lies”. YEARS OF DECEPTION \n1999: Public Interest Lawyers set up. 2004: British troops kill 28 insurgents at the Battle of Danny Boy. Rumours surface that soldiers murdered farmers. Shiner sends Iraqi Mazin Younis to find cases of abuse. 2009: Leigh Day pays Shiner £1.6m for passing on clients. Al-Sweady inquiry begins later that year. 2010: Ihat looks into 1,490 cases, most passed on by Shiner’s firm. 2014: Al-Sweady inquiry finds Shiner’s claims “calculated lies”. 2016: Public Interest Lawyers closes after losing legal aid contract. 2017: Shiner struck off. \nAnother probe, the five-year Al-Sweady public inquiry, cost £25million. It focused on claims made against Brit troops after the Battle of Danny Boy, when they were ambushed in 2004. \nHeroes he accused of murder and mistreating captives were found to be innocent. \nYesterday Tory MP and former Army officer Johnny Mercer said: “For too long we have been dancing to Phil Shiner’s tune. \n“It’s about time we refocus on the soldiers who have been dragged through the mud. That should now close down.” Alamy Tory MP and ex-Army officer Johnny Mercer praised the watchdog's verdict \nShiner was also slated by Gen Sir Mike Jackson, ex head of the British Army. \nHe said: “A lot of soldiers and their families have been living under a dreadful shadow of his creation.” \nThe lawyer’s convictions came after he admitted nine misconduct charges. The watchdog heard he recklessly touted for business in Iraq. \nHe also acted dishonestly by paying his chief fixer “sweeteners” to change evidence to the Al-Sweady inquiry. PA:Press Association 11 Ex-head of the British Army General Sir Mike Jackson said soldiers and their families had been living under a 'dreadful shadow of Shiner's creation' \nThe Iraqi — Mazin Younis, 59 — had been paid £500 for every case he could drum up against British soldiers. \nMore than £3million was forked out in legal aid to Shiner’s now-defunct Birmingham firm Public Interest Lawyers. \nAnother law firm accused of cashing in to the tune of £4.3million — Leigh Day — faces a Solicitors Regulation Authority hearing this year. \nMeanwhile Shiner could face fraud charges. \nAndrew Tabachnik, counsel for the SRA, described his antics as of a “criminal standard”. \nDefence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said after the verdict: “Justice has finally been served. Phil Shiner made soldiers’ lives a misery.” \nWe pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?
