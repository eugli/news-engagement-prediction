Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The messages have been criticised for degrading women \n\"[The slogans] include 'it's easier to apologise than ask for permission', and 'I can already imagine the gaffer tape on your mouth'... and for any member of our society these slogans are sickening and perverse,\" Ms Bates said. \n\"These vans promote rape, encourage sexism and incite violence and control.\" \nThe new powers can be enforced if slogans are not removed within 14 days of a complaint being upheld by the nation's Advertising Standards Bureau.
