This ThankUObama clothing line will keep you close to the Obamas forever \nWhether it’s labelling sizes as smaller than they are to flatter their customers or making their ‘largest’ sizes physically tiny for some mysterious reason, it can sometimes feel like clothing stores have it in for us. \nAnd as one teenager from East Yorkshire recently discovered, it can also get totally out of hand, as she figured out that one pair of size 18 jeans she bought from River Island were smaller than her size 14 pair from New Look. \nSo on New Year’s Eve, she took to Facebook to point out how ridiculous that was. \nShe wrote: Lucy works at a dressage yard and at her local pub<br />(Picture: Lucy Horsley/Facebook) \n‘So the black jeans are a size 14 from new look and the blue ones are a size 18 from river island [sic]. \n‘How on earth can the bigger size be smaller?! \n‘No wonder so many girls have confidence issues and hate buying new clothes, why can’t the sizing be the same in every shop??’ \nShe also explained that the jeans were a similar design too: \n‘NOTE – as this seems to be causing arguments, both of these jeans are high waisted, super skinny and super stretchy with the exact same fastening,’ she said. \nLucy has a point. In a world in which women often – however hard we try not to be – feel defined by their shape, being made to feel we can’t fit into our regular sizes could be damaging indeed. \nThe post has since gone viral, with more than 20,000 Facebook reactions and almost the same number of shares. \nShe apparently discovered the disparity when she found she couldn’t fit into her regular size 14 in any of the high street shops she visited, such as H&M, Topshop and Peacocks. \nWhich for many of us, could be quite a knock to the self-esteem. \nShe told Mail Online : ‘I accidentally ripped my jeans one day and my mum repaired them. ‘They kept on splitting due to wearing them so much and after my mum refused to repair them anymore, I went out to buy some new ones. ‘I tried a size 14 on in them all and I couldn’t get any of them past my bum cheeks. ‘So I got the bigger sizes but still none were comfy enough.’ Us if stores actually sold clothing in our one size (Picture: Pexels) She soon realised that her body wasn’t the problem, but the sizing. ‘I realised it wasn’t me and it was the clothing itself,’ she continued. ‘I was so shocked by the difference, it’s disgraceful. ‘From being a girl who has always fluctuated with weight, it really hurt me. ‘I felt embarrassed buying size 18 jeans.
