That's a lot of looks (granted, it was two shows in one). On average, the number of looks a designer will show in a fashion show hovers around 45, maybe more if he or she is feeling especially inspired. But Michele is a creative director who made his name in the high fashion world by going big, whether it's been slapping tigers and serpents on everything from horsebit loafers to tuxedo jackets or bringing excess back to menswear (more color! more embroidery! more Donald Duck!). \nToday's massive tally doesn't also account for the fact that each of the looks was a madcap mash-up unlike anything we've seen, and for the more-is-better direction the brand has taken under the guidance of designer Alessandro Michele, that's saying something. \n“Fashion is the most beautiful illusion you can have,” Michele told us last year of his wild, poetic, and philosophical creative process. But if all that sounds high falutin, just look to the show he presented for the insanity that it produces. Here's just a few of the things that we saw: Wallpaper floral-print tailoring, dog collars, PVC-slick leather pants, studded motorcycle jackets, leather cropped overalls, flared '70s trousers, bedazzled fanny packs, nose rings, bowling shoes, green shimmering unitards with torso cutaways, 18th century style breeches, rock concert T-shirts, Gucci-logo thermal underwear sets, bags worn as necklaces, pirate boots, one AC/DC tee, one screen-printed kitten tee—and that's just the beginning. It's as much a collection of ultimate luxury goods as it is a game of \"Guess the Inspiration.\" \nAnd the crazier thing than people's reaction to the clothes from the Gucci Fall 2017 collection is how they'll sell—and fast. Because somehow, Michele is breaking every rule of design and reaping in the rewards for it—last year, Kering, the parent company of Gucci, saw the brand saw a 17% rise in sales . \nPure insanity? Yes, most certainly. Will you every guy with the means to buy it be rocking the appliquéd topcoats, web stripe sweatbands, and attention-grabbing tailoring? Absolutely.
