Government grants \nSeveral big cities around the world have said they want to ban diesel cars within 10 years, because of the pollution they cause. \nA group of doctors has called on the Mayor of London to ban them in the capital, while Westminster will hit some diesel drivers with extra parking charges from April. \nThe government is also thought to be planning a diesel scrappage scheme, to encourage motorists to ditch cars which are the heaviest polluters. \nHowever, the SMMT figures show that overall sales of vehicles in the UK last month were at their highest January level in 12 years. \nIn total 174,564 cars were sold, a rise of 2.9% on January 2016. \nMotorists who buy electric or hybrid petrol/electric cars still enjoy a grant from the government, worth up to 35% - or Â£4,500 - of the total value.
