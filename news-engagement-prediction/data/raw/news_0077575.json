'Important for Iraqis' \nThe Wikimedia Foundation states on its website that it does not pay mobile phone providers who sign up to the programme and they do not get any editorial control over the platform. \nSarmad Saeed Yassen and his wife Ravan Jaafar Altaie are volunteer Wikipedia editors based in Iraq, editing in Arabic and Kurdish. \nMr Yassen is a telecoms engineer in Erbil, Iraq. \n\"Mobile internet is available everywhere but the price can be expensive,\" he told the BBC. \n\"Having Wikipedia free is going to be very important to people and also to companies.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:40:01.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
