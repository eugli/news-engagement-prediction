Theskaters promptly dove in to help get them out.\n\"I look over, I saw six heads just trying to get to the shore,\" Bennett Jonas, one of the skating Samaritans told the broadcaster. \"The back one was probably a good 20 yards from dry land.\"\n\nJonas and the other skater, Ethan Turmbull, had successfullyrescued all the kids by the time the New York Fire Department arrived at the scene. Six of the seven would-be selfie-takerswere treated for hypothermia at nearby hospitals, and the FDNY posted a picture of a diver investigating the pond to ensurethere were no other victims in its icy depths. There'sno word on where the kids' parents were when they were potentially drowning in Central Park.\nIn 2015, more people died from selfies than shark attacks, including people who fell off cliffs, were shot posing with guns, and one man who had a heart attack after falling down the stairs at the Taj Mahal. Things got so bad in Russia they launched a campaign for \" safe selfies .\" The city of Pamplona, Spain, even outlawed them during itsannual running of the bulls, and Mumbai, India, banned them at 16 of the city's major attractions after a spike in deaths.\nMaybe regulations for Central Park aren't far behind, or maybe kids should just think twice beforegoing out onto a frozen pond on a 50-degree day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:00:20.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
