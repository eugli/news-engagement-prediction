Minkler announced Tuesday that at the end of the five-day trial, 38-year-old Duprece Jett, Indianapolis; 38-year-old Damion McKissick, Fort Wayne; and 38-year-old Earl Lee Walker, Fort Wayne, were each found guilty. \n“The reign of terror for these three men is over,” Minkler said in a statement. “Those who put our citizens in harm’s way and disrupt commerce in Central Indiana will be held accountable.” \nJett and McKissick were called the \"Rick James robbers\" because of the long hair and sunglasses they used as a disguise. In surveillance footage released shortly after one of their robberies, one man was seen dressed as James, while the other was dressed like Youngblood Priest from the classic '70s movie \"Super Fly.\" \nAccording to court documents, they started in September 2015 with the robbery of the Advanced America Check Cashing Service in the 5600 block of Georgetown Road in Indianapolis. \nThat was followed by the robberies of the Indiana Members Credit Union on Wesleyan Road in Indianapolis on Sept. 19, 2015, and in Avon on Nov. 19, 2015. \nOn Dec. 12, 2015, Jett, McKissick and Walker attempted to rob the IMCU near East 96th Street and Grey Road in Carmel, court documents said. Police intervened and the trio fled, sparking a car chase that went through Hamilton, Marion and Boone counties. \nOfficials said the men led officers on a pursuit that reached speeds in excess of 100 mph while swerving in and out of traffic and running traffic signals. The chase eventually ended near the intersection of U.S. 421 and Ind. 32 where all three suspects were arrested. \nAccording to Assistant U.S. Attorneys Bradley P. Shepard and Peter Blackett, the defendants could face up to 40 years behind bars. Sentencing for all three is scheduled for May 2017. \nCall IndyStar reporter Justin L. Mack at (317) 444-6138.
