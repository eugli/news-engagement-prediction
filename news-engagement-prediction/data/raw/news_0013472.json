Singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus taking coke. F***ing joke.” \nBlasting the honours committee, Beckham, who won an OBE in 2003, said: “I expected nothing less. It’s a disgrace to be honest and if I was American I would of got something like this 10 years ago.” \nIn another leaked email he appears to refuse to donate $1m to an event run by UNICEF, declaring “it’s my f***ing money”. \nThe revelations caused a storm on Twitter, with users tearing into the global icon, believing his UNICEF work was just glory-seeking. \nAmong those attacking him was TV presenter Piers Morgan. He branded the multi-millionaire “repulsive” for his rant against singer Katherine Jenkins. \nHe added: “Oh. My. God. RIP Brand Beckham…” \nAnd later he tweeted: “Nobody will be envious of David Beckham by tomorrow. They will all be sickened by him”. Piers Morgan has been critical of Beckham over the emails (Photo: Rex Features) \nBut a close friend of Beckham said: “He is very calm at the moment because he knows the great work that he has done for UNICEF. But he is just saddened that people would question all of that work. \n“Genuinely, he wasn’t as vitriolic as that, but you do say some things in private and in the heat of the moment. \n“To be honest, he does feel that he has given so much to his country. And sometimes you say things in private that anyone would say and you don’t really mean it.” \nReferring to an email about honours in which he is alleged to have written “unless it is a knighthood, f*** off”, the pal said: “While he was frustrated in those emails, he was over it the moment he sent them. \n“Getting the knighthood is not what his work is about. He doesn’t care if he gets a knighthood or not.” \nUNICEF figures largely in the emails, and those are the most damaging to his image as a caring children’s ambassador.

To pour this million into the fund, is like putting my own money in. Beckham meets Sebenelle, 14, in Makhewu, Swaziland, last year   AsiaPac) \n“If there was no fund, the money would be for me. This f***ing money is mine.” \nBut a friend of the star said: “The one thing David is very proud of and feels can’t be faulted is his work for UNICEF. He has not only donated his own money, he has raised millions to help vulnerable children around the world. \n“More importantly he has worked with the charity over the last 15 years. \n“The fact that there are these hackers who are selectively in some instances cheekily doctoring some of that information saddens him.

He has got work commitments coming up and he has constant work with UNICEF. \n“There is always work he is doing with the charity, whether that is dinners or field trips. There are always a lot of things planned. \n“Nothing will deter him or stop him from continuing with UNICEF. He is incredibly proud of what he is doing.

It’s the first time an ambassador in UN history has his own fund. Why these people want to detract from such great work is unbelievable.” \nA statement released by the charity on Saturday said: “UNICEF has become aware of media reports relating to 7: The David Beckham Unicef Fund. \n“Some reports relate to alleged private correspondence between our ambassador and other parties, which we have not seen and cannot comment upon. \n“David Beckham has been a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2005. \n“As well as generously giving his time, energy and support to help raise awareness and funds for UNICEF’s work for children, David has given ­significant funds personally.” Read More UNICEF defends David Beckham after claims leaked e-mails show he demanded charity pay for £6,685 business class flight \nAs the scandal threatened to engulf the star, it was business as usual for his wife, Victoria who tweeted her 11.3 million followers about her latest fashion range just hours after the emails surfaced. \nBeckham left the US on Thursday afternoon aboard a British Airways plane after partying with Poppy ­Delevingne at the West Hollywood hotspot The Friend. \nTravelling first class on the flight, alongside The Voice coach Will.I.Am, he landed at Heathrow shortly after 11am on Friday, hours before the story broke. \nAirport onlookers said he looked “relaxed”. And he seemed unperturbed on Saturday as he watched Brooklyn, 17, in action at a skateboard park. \nLast night PR expert Mark Borkowski said: “If you’re being flown all over the world the costs will rack up and the basic problem is that these things have slipped out. \n\"It’s not helpful but, then again, people don’t realise the complexities that go into celebrities being involved with charities. \n\"Even these game shows that you see on TV, where people play for charity, they still get paid.” \nMeanwhile Vicky Browning, chief executive of the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, said: “His relationship with Unicef has been incredibly helpful for the charity in terms of raising money and raising awareness.” \nShe added: “It’s not unreasonable for people whose time is highly valuable to get sensible recompense for their expenses.” David Beckham lights The Empire State Building blue in honor of UNICEF's 70th anniversary last year (Photo: WireImage) \nA spokesman for Beckham said last night the leaks were “outdated material taken out of context from hacked and doctored private emails from a third party server giving a deliberately inaccurate picture”. \nHe added: “David Beckham and UNICEF have had a powerful partnership in support of children for over 15 years. The David Beckham 7 Fund specifically has raised millions of pounds and helped millions of vulnerable ­children around the world. \n“David has given significant time and energy and has made personal financial donations to the 7 Fund and this commitment will continue. \n“He and UNICEF are rightly proud of what they have and will continue to achieve together and are happy to let the facts speak for themselves.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:07:51.427+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
