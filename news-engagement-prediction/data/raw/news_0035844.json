Panneerselvam alleged that the floor test conducted after the eviction of Opposition members went against democratic norms. \n“Dharma has been momentarily eclipsed but it shall win finally”, the former Chief Minister said. \n“MLAs were confined in resorts. Since the Governor had granted 15 days to prove majority, we said the MLAs should be allowed to go to their constituencies and talk to the people before they exercised their vote. We also sought secret ballot but the Speaker refused”. \n“DMK MLAs were forcibly evicted from the House. They were also injured. Now people will judge them. When these MLAs go to the people they will realise the opposition. The voters will certainly question them”, Mr. Panneerselvam said. \n“We all belong to Amma's (Jayalalithaa) faction. We will win with the people's support in the future”, Mr. Panneerselvam said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T17:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T12:42:17.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
