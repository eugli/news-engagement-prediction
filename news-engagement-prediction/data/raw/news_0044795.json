Eat kale! Clean up the gear room! — are probably not going to magically stick this week. But instead of telling you a bunch of good habits to pick up (hey, that takes work), we’re focusing on six really bad ones you should break before your next trip. Habit 1: Overloading your schedule \nTrying to do too much? It’s a trip ruiner. Photo: soft_light/ Shutterstock If you have every page of your travel guide dog-eared and highlighted, chances are you’re going to run yourself ragged by the end of your trip and miss out on the nuances of being in a new place. \nRELATED: Advice on how to avoid an overambitious travel mistake \nYou don’t want to spend your vacation running through a new city “Home Alone” style when you could be admiring the architecture instead. \nBreak it: Nail down one main hike, tour or attraction you want to experience on each day of your trip and let the rest happen naturally. Habit 2: Being too damn cheap \nNickel-and-diming every aspect of your vacation? It’s a natural reaction to dropping hundreds of your hard-earned dollars on airfare. \nRELATED: Flight booking hack: Keep your searches top secret \nBut you aren’t going to recoup your losses by eating peanut butter and jelly for a week — and nothing ruins a trip faster than stressing out about money. \nBreak it: Book the trip you can actually afford. Spend less on airfare and reserve some budget for a handful of dinners, tours, campsites and souvenirs. Don’t forget to account for emergency costs, like late-night cab fares and surprise baggage fees. Habit 3: Taking too many pictures \nPut down the camera and live the experience instead of just documenting it. Photo: Maridav/ Shutterstock How many times have you jumped out of the car on a road trip with camera in hand, ready to shoot an epic sunset or mountain vista? \nNew research says you may want to take in the scene with your own two eyes before you start clicking. Taking too many pictures can actually alter the way your brain processes an experience: You’ll forget it faster because you rely on your camera to remember it for you. \nBreak it: Set up your camera to take a quick burst of photos, then put it back in your camera bag and take in the scene with nothing but your five senses for at least 10 minutes before pulling the camera back out again. Habit 4: Sticking to the familiar \nYes, Applebee’s makes a killer wonton taco, and it would certainly be easier to order off a menu you recognize while in a foreign place, but when you opt for an experience you can have back at home, you miss out on one of the best effects of travel: being uncomfortable. \nRELATED: Here are 3 adventure combos you need to try immediately \nThat feeling of unfamiliarity is what leads to new discoveries (and maybe even a new favorite appetizer). \nBreak it: Put yourself in pint-sized unfamiliar experiences daily, like testing out your Spanish skills at the restaurant where no one speaks English. Habit 5: Having someone else’s trip \nTraveling right is an important skill to have. Photo: Tom Eversley/Unsplash With a myriad of resources offering crowd-sourced information about a destination — TripAdvisor, Yelp and even Pinterest — it’s easy to form assumptions about a place before you’ve even stepped off the plane (and to plan accordingly). \nRELATED: 5 amazing under-the-radar travel destinations to explore this year \nBreak it: Ask friends for advice on a place if they’ve been there before, but don’t mimic their experience minute by minute. Instead, write down a list of their must-do activities, restaurants, surf spots and hikes, and aim to experience the top three. Leave the rest up to your own judgment when you arrive. Habit 6: Playing tour guide \nJust because you’ve been there before, that doesn’t mean you should call the shots. Photo: Nicram Sabod/ Shutterstock If you’re making a return trip somewhere with companions who have never been there before, don’t attempt to make all the decisions for the group — at least not the entire time. \nOf course you want to show your friends that great shop you visited on your last sojourn, but this is also an opportunity to have brand-new experiences together. \nBreak it: Let the newbies lead the trip, offering a few suggestions along the way. Never attempt to recreate your last vacation — no matter how much fun you had.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:38:49.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
