Mr Lasker said an autopsy had begun. \nThe couple’s oldest son Jake, 19, who had Asperger’s syndrome, was stabbed to death in 2012 by Max Peter Smith, who was jailed for life in 2014. \nKyle Mitchell Dumesny, who had plotted the killing with Smith, pleaded guilty to manslaughter last October and was jailed for seven years. media_camera Jake Lasker, 19, was stabbed to death in 2012. \nMr Lasker said the couple yesterday had been surrounded by close friends. \n“It’s rocked our world to lose both sons in five years,” he said. \n“You don’t ever expect to have a funeral for your 19-year-old son and then to have another one for your 21-year-old son. \n“I’m so lost.” \nFamily friend Damien Kampf raised money for Jake’s funeral costs five years ago through donation tins and the generosity of the Toowoomba community. \nHe has now created a GoFundMe campaign to help the couple prepare to bury another child. \n“No parent should have to bury their child, let alone two,” he said. \nPolice last night were unable to comment on the matter.
