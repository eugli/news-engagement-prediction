In a video for the 2017 Makers Conference released on Monday, the former Secretary of State addresses the year’s theme (“Be Bold”), and reiterates how important it is that the conference “shares women’s stories and celebrate women’s vital roles in the past, present and future of our country.” She then offers her own take on why girls and women everywhere have the power to do anything they set their minds to, giving a subtle jab at President Trump by again reaffirming her support for the Women’s March. “Despite all the challenges we face, I remain convinced that, yes, the future is female,” she said. “Just look at the amazing energy we saw last month as women organised a march that galvanised millions of people all over our country and across the world.” Clinton then called for women around the world to keep the momentum going, and to remain bold—now more than ever. “We need strong women to step up and speak out,” she said. “We need you to dare greatly and lead boldly. So please, set an example for every women and girl out there who’s worried about what the future holds, and wonders whether our rights, opportunities, and values will endure.” “And remember, you are the heroes and history makers, the glass ceiling breakers of the future,” she continued. “As I’ve said before, I’ll say again, never doubt you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and every opportunity in the world.” You can watch the entirety of Clinton’s statement below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T17:29:10.557+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
