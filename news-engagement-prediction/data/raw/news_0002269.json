Robert Heath, who represents Isbell and the city, said he was disappointed with the ruling, although he noted that the court found he had one strong argument -- questioning whether a plan that produces proportional representation of all demographics in an election can be discriminatory. \nFour out of eight seats went to Hispanic-preferred candidates in 2015 under the 6-2 plan, and he argued before the panel that Hispanics would only do better in future elections. \n\"The Hispanic population is steadily growing,\" he said. \"It's just going to get better going forward.\" \nAs of Friday, 14 candidates have submitted their names for the eight city council positions. The mayor's seat is also on the May ballot; Isbell is facing term-limits and cannot seek re-election.
