Our checks revealed that Premium Steel and Mines Limited are set to begin the revamping process of the plant which cannot be except the former staff, who are lurking at the corner waiting for their entitlements to be settled. \n‘’Our contention is that Premium Steel and Mines should be given the chance to prove that they are capable of turning around the fortunes of DSC in the interest of all stakeholders.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:03:24.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
