They planned it together, and it is IMPOSSIBLE she fucking forgot and SO conveniently booked a staycation THAT AFTERNOON, in the evening with her \"mother\". \nFucking bitch you think we all stupid is it. Who goes on a dinner and then a staycation with their \"mum\" on Valentine's Day with that kind of caption on their pictures. My friend actually bothered to go and buy a present for her y'know and booked the tickets to the movie. He had to go watch the movie alone while she was off frolicking with her fucking BOYFRIEND in some fancy hotel. Advertisement \nAnd when I messaged her? All the excuses come out. I can't even. DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS INTERESTED? WHY WOULD ANYONE ASK A GIRL OUT ON VALENTINE'S DAY FOR DINNER AND A MOVIE THEN? OH COULD IT BE PERHAPS HE WANTED TO START A LIFELONG BEAUTIFUL FUCKING FRIENDSHIP WITH YOU? OR MAYBE IF YOU USE YOUR COMMON SENSE YOU'LL REALIZE THAT FEB 14TH IS A COUPLES DAY. \nIM SO ANGRY WHY DO THESE PEOPLE EXIST JUST SAY IF YOU NOT INTERESTED LA == PEOPLE'S FEELINGS NOT FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT Y'KNOW. \nEdit: I wanna tag her but I can't since she's not my fb friend but here's her name - Lucille Wong (SHE DEACT HER ACC) \nEdit edit: I originally censored her identity because I didn't expect the post to go so viral, but since everyone is now a CSI investigator like fuck it expose her. \nEdit edit edit: For more info on her pls refer here --> http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/lucille-wong-fl...
