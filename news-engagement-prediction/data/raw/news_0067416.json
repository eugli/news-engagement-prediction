Mr Pietryka said that when Webster arrived at Lincoln Station he was told he would not be allowed to travel without a ticket. He then vaulted the barrier and got on the train only to be removed. ‘At 7.43pm the train left the station. As it was doing so the defendant was seen to be hanging on the back of the train as it pulled out of the station,’ he said. ‘The driver was informed and it was brought to a halt. The guard and the driver got off and walked down the track. Idiotic James Webster, 38, climbed on top of the busy passenger service in a bid to get home from Lincoln ‘They saw the defendant sat on top of the train. The police had been called out and they arrived. ‘The defendant started to run off down the tracks to avoid being detained. He jumped over a fence into the university campus and was chased by the police. He was caught and arrested.’ Webster, 38, admitted obstructing the Northern Rail train and being drunk on a railway on January 30. His lawyer Dean Bower said his client apologised for what happened, adding: ‘Since he has sobered up the word he has used to describe his actions is idiotic. ‘He has asked me to apologise on his behalf particularly for the inconvenience he caused to the passengers. ‘On the face of it he was trying to get back to Gainsborough. He didn’t have any money. ‘He thought that if he didn’t get the train he would have to sleep on the streets. He didn’t really think what he was doing. ‘Had he thought rationally he wouldn’t have done it. He plainly put his own safety at considerable risk.’ Magistrates sentenced Webster to a 12 month community order and a three month night time curfew. He was also ordered to pay £85 costs and an £85 victim surcharge. The photo of Webster sitting on the train went viral on social media after it was posted online. One Twitter user alerted a stranded friend with the message: ‘The cause of your delay!’ David Pullen joked: ‘It beats Jeremy Corbyn sitting on the floor when not enough seats.’ Chef George Smith added: ‘Don’t worry, it’s just Bond!’ and Lee Townhill said ‘Was it Steven Seagal?’ Obstructing a train is an offence under the Malicious Damage Act 1861, while being drunk on a railway is not permitted by the Railways Act 2005.
