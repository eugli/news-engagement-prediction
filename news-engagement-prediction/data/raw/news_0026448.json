In the circumstances, the vice president will continue to act on my behalf. \n“Please accept, Distinguished Senate President, the assurances of my highest consideration.” \nMr. Buhari had on January 18 written the National Assembly, notifying the legislature that he was proceeding on a 10-day leave and temporarily transferring presidential power to Vice-president Yemi Osinbajo. \nThe leave was supposed to last 10 work days, between January 23 and February 6, according to the letter transmitted to both chambers of the National Assembly. \nThe President, whose real medical condition remained unknown, was expected to arrive the country on February 5 for resumption of work on February 6. \nBut the extension of his vacation means Mr. Osinbajo will continue to exercise presidential powers for days or weeks to come. \nThis is the third time Mr. Buhari has transferred power to Mr. Osinbajo since the two leaders were inaugurated in May 2015. \nThe first time was on February 5, 2016 when the President embarked on a five-day vacation; and the second was in June 2016 when Mr. Buhari travelled to the United Kingdom for treatment of what the Presidency described as ear infection. \nA formal notice to both chambers of the National Assembly on the president’s intention to proceed on leave and hand over power temporarily to the vice-president is in compliance with Section 145 (1) of the Nigerian Constitution.
