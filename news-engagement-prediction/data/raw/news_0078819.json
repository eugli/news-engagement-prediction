Trees are cut down for heating and illegal timber sales. \nStatements from the Taliban on environmental issues are rare. \nAkhundzada, who became leader of the Taliban last May, has a stronger reputation as a religious leader than a military chief. \nSunday's \"special message\", carried on official Taliban outlets, was in stark contrast to the more familiar fiery rhetoric against the Afghan government and its Nato coalition backers. \n\"Tree plantation plays an important role in environmental protection, economic development and beautification of earth,\" the Taliban leader said, in a report carried by the Afghan Taliban Voice of Jihad website.
