I thought the fan-base was great. Never thought he'd fight in the UFC. Everybody wanted to see this fight and I picked him because I like the guy. \nFrank then doubled back on his comments, and suggested that CM Punk doesn't deserve to be in the UFC, before arguing that this fight is being demanded by the fans: \nSo I was just thinking the fan-base would love it, then I talked to them about it and he's like, 'Yeah' and then started saying he's a purple belt in jiu-jitsu and I started believing him and all this stuff started to come out. I don't know if he was just saying that to impress me at the time, or if he never thought this could possibly ever happen with us. It was very possible. I like the guy, I like CM Punk, I'd just like to show the world who is the best in the world and that's why he and me should fight, to see who's the best in the world.\" Do Fans Want To See This Fight? @UFC 208 Jason David Frank vs CM Punk it will put asses in the seats and draw big money make it happen @DanaWhite #UFC207 #UFC208 pic.twitter.com/PPeHeJPSOD — $ROB$ (@GULLYKING82) December 31, 2016 \nLet’s face it, it’s hard to take Jason David Frank seriously when he's constantly posting self-aggrandizing motivational pictures on Twitter, but the truth is that he can fight. He’s already has a few victories under his belt - he won his first MMA match in 22 seconds against Carlos Horn – and even though he's 43 years old, Frank is in amazing shape. \nCM Punk on the other hand, is a character that people love to hate. They hated him when he was in the WWE, and his actions since his departure have made him even less popular. CM Punk left a bad taste in the mouths of WWE fans when he left and aired a lot of the company’s dirty laundry. His UFC career has been a disaster – with his staggering loss to Mickey Gall – and the controversy on whether he belongs in the UFC at all. I would genuinely still like to see Jason David Frank knock CM Punk on his ass. That would be grand. #ItsMorphinTime #TeamGreenRanger — Patriarchy Demon (@DemonPatriarch) February 19, 2017 \nPer the fan response on Twitter, they want this match to happen as badly as JFD said they did. The following tweets are from fans that are really excited to see the JFD vs. CM Punk match – and most of them want JFD to kick the shit out of CM Punk: @danawhite I think it's stupid to not give CM Punk another fight in UFC please \"CM Punk V.S Jason David Frank\" #ListenToTwitter — Josh Amiss (@xAMISSx) October 15, 2016 #UFC207 CM Punk vs. Jason David Frank. Book it Dana White — Anthony DiGrande (@AnthonyDiGrande) December 25, 2016 @TMZ @TMZ_Sports Jason David Frank would knock CM Punk out or tap him in first round — Matthew Dudley (@TheMattDudley) October 15, 2016 \nThe idea for this fight has bounced around since 2015, and it’s about time that it happens. Jason David Frank is more than up for the challenge, but it’s up to Dana White and CM Punk to make this match happen. The tweets listed above prove that the fans really want to see this fight– if nothing more than to see CM Punk get his ass beat again. \nAt this point, nothing has been confirmed, but the challenged has been thrown down. In the meantime, if you want to see modern Rangers throw down, you can catch Power Rangers in theaters on March 24, 2017. \nSound Off! Do you want to see JFD fight CM Punk?
