She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!” 9:51 a.m. ET \n“If the U.S. does not win this case as it so obviously should, we can never have the security and safety to which we are entitled. Politics!” 6:03 a.m. ET \nBackstory 1 : It’s extraordinary for a sitting president to attack a company because of its business ties with a family member, in this case daughter Ivanka. Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, have moved from Manhattan to Washington to take on roles in the Trump White House. Ivanka has no formal White House title. \nNordstrom told the Associated Press in a Feb. 3 statement, “We’ve said all along we make buying decisions based on performance.” \nBackstory 2: On Tuesday a three-judge 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel heard from Trump administration lawyers seeking to overturn an emergency stay of the Trump’s travel ban, acting after a Seattle federal judge issued a temporary restraining order. \nTrump has jabbed at that Seattle circuit judge, appointed by a Republican president, calling him a ‘so-called’ judge. \nTrump has a light day ahead. He’s speaking in the morning at a conference, has an intelligence briefing and then has a legislative affairs strategy session. \nTrump very soon will have to focus more on Congress. House Speaker Paul Ryan invited Trump to address a joint session of Congress on Feb. 28. \nThe use of the words ‘joint session’ have a special meaning. New presidents by tradition do not deliver formal ‘State of the Union’ speeches in the weeks after taking office because they have not had a chance yet to assess the state of the nation.
