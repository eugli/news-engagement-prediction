Shocked and frazzled, she quickly called up her friend, Sushma Sathyanarayana, who was in the same building. \nbangaloremirror \nIn the next few minutes, the two women found a clean cloth to wipe and cover the freezing newborn and asked around for her parents. Nothing came of it. A small crowd had gathered and the hollering baby had started to become quieter, which worried the two women. \nThey dialled 108 for an ambulance and asked some of the bystanders if they would accompany them to the hospital. Nobody wanted to come. \n“We asked the people in the apartment, especially the men, if they could accompany us to the hospital. But nobody wanted to get involved in the case. They just stood there clicking photos,” Mythri told Mirror. \nAbout 45 minutes later, the pick-up arrived and the women and the baby left for the hospital. \nThe ambulance driver took them to Indira Gandhi Institute of Child Health Hospital, near Nimhans. By the time they reached and admitted the baby, it was 12.30 a m. \n“The doctors were very helpful. They immediately started treating the baby and told us that we had brought her just in time, which had saved her life. Those words made all the effort worthwhile. We were so happy to know the baby would be fine,” said Sushma. Hunt For Mother \nWith baby safely in the hospital, the two were taken to the Siddapura police station nearby where the police took their statements. They were then asked to file a complaint with the Electronics City police, which they did. \nOn their way back home, they got a call from the police, who had found the mother. “We reached the apartment and the police informed us that the woman who gave birth to the baby lived in a slum next to our apartment. The woman had told the police that she didn’t want the baby and, so, had left her at the apartment,” said Mythri. \nbangaloremirror Don't Miss ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T18:54:02.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
