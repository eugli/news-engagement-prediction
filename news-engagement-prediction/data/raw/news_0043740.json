He never really embodied any political movement other than one that sought his own self-aggrandizement as a way to undress some of the absurd pieties of political correctness. Indeed, his shtick was shunned by much of the conservative movement even if he spent plenty time attacking Liberal pieties involving race, immigration and gender. \nNo, the lesson that can be gleaned here is one about the left, which through its fundamentalist orthodoxy, known as political correctness, created a vacuum of Conservative thought in our cultural establishments including much of the mainstream media, and of course in academia. \nMilo in all his outrageousness became the voice of opposition, or at least the one that sucked the most air out of the room. \nConservatives have long complained about being denied access to university lectures (or when they were invited to speak, being shouted down by left-wing agitators), the creepy Stalinist nature of speech codes in various cultural institutions (ie academia but also the media, and the arts) not to mention the obviously left-wing slanted coverage of news. \nIn his dystopian classic “1984,” George Orwell may not have totally predicted the insanity and totalitarianism sweeping our cultural institutions, but he came pretty close. After years of excoriating conservatives as bigots and troglodytes for believing in such \"hot button\" issues as low taxes and of course the teaching of Western civilization, the left has nullified the true meaning of racism and many other \"isms\" to include anything that deviates from their stated orthodoxy. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nA swastika painted on a building is clearly a police matter and should never be tolerated. But at the University of Missouri (my alma mater) such an incident led to weeks of protests, hunger strikes and the resignation of the university’s president for a reason that no one can fully articulate. After the election of President Donald Trump, a Yale professor allowed students to skip an exam so they could grieve. \nAll of which gave Milo his opening. He may or may not believe the crazy stuff he often says (I’m not going to catalogue the litany, which is easy to look up) in his columns at Breitbart News, or his many speaking engagements. But he knew how to get under the skin of the totalitarian left and as his adversaries went low, Milo went lower on those taboo issues such as race, immigration and a lot more. \nThe left ridiculed religious conservatives, who believed that marriage is between a man and a woman, as bigots. Milo, as a gay man, once wrote on his Facebook page that “Gay marriage is not a ‘civil rights’ struggle. Stop comparing gays and blacks. When gay men are slaves it’s because we begged to be.” More from FOXBusiness.com...
