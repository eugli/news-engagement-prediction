But as powerful as the truck’s twin turbo 3.5-liter V6 is, the sound just isn’t as boot-shakingly badass as the last generation’s V8. I thought a MagnaFlow exhaust might change that but, well, why don’t you listen and decide for yourself? \nI guess sound quality, like design, is largely objectively appreciated. But I know I’m not the only one who thinks the 2017 Raptor sounds a little dinky, or Ford wouldn’t have bothered augmenting the truck’s engine noises through its speakers.

I’m hearing lots of drone and rasp, but not enough guttural breathing that makes a big truck sound like a lurking monster. \nFrankly, I think modifying a Raptor is silly to begin with. Why throw off the brilliant cohesive package that so many OEM engineers spent so much effort dialing in unless it’s somehow truly not worthy? If you must start throwing parts at it... maybe stick to lights and tire carriers instead of louder pipes.
