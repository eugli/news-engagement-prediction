(Michael Ares / AP) Perry Stein, David A. Fahrenthold The Washington Post \nThe Saturday evening march began at Trump Plaza, a high-rise apartment building. President Donald Trump hasn't actually owned since 1991. Fine. It still has the name. It was a good place to start. \nFrom there, the marchers headed south, walking along the Intracoastal Waterway that separates West Palm Beach from ritzy Palm Beach island. They stopped shortly after 7 p.m. when they reached the bridge across from Mar-a-Lago. \nThey brought signs and glow sticks to wave, hoping they'd be visible across the dark water and the great green lawn of the club from up in the private apartment that is now the \"winter White House.\" \nIf Trump sees those green lights, he'll know that his critics have followed him home. \n\"He likes to think that everybody loves him. We're showing him that we don't,\" said Lisa Wright, 53, an IT consultant from Broward County who was marching along the waterway Saturday night. \nBy sunset, about 1,000 people were marching single file in places to avoid waterfront construction fences but chanting as they went. \nAcross the street, a few dozen pro-Trump people waved American flags, but the spectacle was the protesters, beating drums, singing and chanting. \nThis is the reality of Trump's honeymoon-free presidency.

(Brennan Linsley / AP) \nHaving sought to create unprecedented disruption in Washington, his critics will now seek to bring unprecedented disruption to his life as president - including demonstrations that follow him when he travels and protests that will dog his businesses even when he doesn't. \nAlready this week, Trump - the most unpopular new president in modern times - canceled a trip to the Harley-Davidson factory in Milwaukee, where local groups had planned to protest his appearance; the White House said the protests were not the reason for the cancellation. \nAnd, around the business empire that Trump still owns, his critics treat each location as an avatar for the president. \nThere have been small gestures of pique: lipstick graffiti on the sign at Trump's golf course in Los Angeles and a plan for a mass mooning of his hotel in Chicago. There have also been more organized efforts to take time and money away from family businesses - a boycott of stores selling Ivanka Trump's clothes and a campaign to flood Trump businesses with calls demanding that the president divest from his holdings. \nFor Trump's opponents, these demonstrations are a way to change his behavior by denting the president's own self-image as a popular man with a successful business. \nThe risk, for them, is that protests meant to shame Trump will consume energy that could be used to beat him by winning elections and swaying votes in Congress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:52:53.450+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
