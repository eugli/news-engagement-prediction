Joseph Schmidt   \nDespite the departure of music teacher Miss Grundy—or rather, Jennifer Gibson— Archie ’s budding songwriting career might not take a big hit. \nIn Riverdale Chapter Five: Heart of Darkness, Archie nearly found a new mentor to help with his music, courtesy of Valerie from Josie and the Pussycats . \nIn the episode, Archie struggled with dividing his time and efforts between a promising football position and making music. He found himself in a head-to-head competition with Reggie Mantle over a captains position on the squad, along with the expectation of living up to Jason Blossom’s status on the team by wearing his number. \nAnd even though Archie won the captainship, he turned it down so he could focus on his music, opting to remain on the team while pursuing songwriting. \nBut the potential mentor that Valerie steered him toward wasn’t keen on helping Archie, and told him to move on. With all of the doubt and mixed desires, in the wake of being left behind by the teacher he was sleeping with, Archie seemed to be overwhelmed. \nAnd then Valerie assured him that the only person holding him back was himself, and she became his guiding force. Now there’s just one question… \nWhat will Josie say? \nFrom the first episode, Josie has had a domineering presence, only assisting Archie when he’s most pathetic. She doesn’t want to take his suggestions and only does at insistence. \nSo what will she do when she finds out her back-up singer and keyboard player is assisting Archie with his own songwriting? \nIn the comics, Archie and Valerie entered into a relationship pre-reboot. So even though that storyline has been reset in the Archie universe, there’s also a precedent for their partnership to move past songwriting and into something more romantic. Plus, we all know Archie has a thing for people who help him out with his music. \nWill Archie drive a wedge between the Pussycats and break them up? The CW ’s adaptation of the classic comics have shown a willingness to alter storylines drastically. We wouldn’t be surprised if Archie comes between them, but we hope Riverdale keeps the awesome musical numbers intact. \nThe next episode of Riverdale , Chapter Six: Faster, Pussycats! Kill! Kill! airs Thursday March 2. Riverdale Thursday at on The CW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:50:35.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
