This simple truth informed the Moody Blues vocalist/bassist as he recorded last year’s solo album “10,000 Light Years Ago.” \nThe album represents a career spent in pursuit of sound. At turns deeply psychedelic and simplistically folklike, “Light Years” represents different facets of Lodge’s songwriting prowess while holding to his progressive rock roots. \n“I really wanted to write about who I am today and what’s brought me to where I am,” says Lodge, who will be in Central Florida this weekend before taking his band on the prog-rock-focused Cruise to the Edge, a five-day outing featuring groups such as Yes and Kansas. \nThe past may be gone, but Lodge, 71, was certainly able to reach back and pull some key parts of it into the present for this latest project. In setting out to record his first solo album since 1977’s “Natural Avenue,” Lodge called upon original Moodys Ray Thomas and Mike Pinder for the track “Simply Magic.” His touring 10,000 Light Years Band includes keyboardist Alan Hewitt, flute player Norda Mullen and drummer Gordon Marshall, all from The Moody Blues’ vast catalog of current and former members.

In addition to streaming and CD, “Light Years” is available on high-grade vinyl “because the sound is so good,” he says. \nBut Lodge is certainly no stranger to the future, and he likes where the age of recording has gone. Rather than the old way of getting a band together in some location for a couple weeks to record everything in the studio, Lodge chose his musicians and then simply sent them the files. “If I make the demos first, then send them to my keyboard guy … he could put a basic keyboard track on them,” he says. “Then I could send the files to my drummer who lives in London.” So with only a recording of guiding vocals and a sample bass riff, each player was able to build on the tracks in their own home studios at their own paces. \nLodge was a fan of the process. “It was a totally different experience and I loved it,” he says. “For me, it’s the way to work.” When a schedule forces members into a studio at a particular moment, “sometimes it’s not the exact right time to be creative.” \nThe patience of this new process is reflected in the epic songwriter’s musical taste. “A lot of the hit songs today … you can be done with them in 15 seconds,” he says. “It’s quick and disposable.” \nLodge says one of the big themes of this recent album is commitment. “If you commit in life, you’ll get the reward that comes with commitment,” he says. “I think people who don’t commit never get that reward and their always complaining why not.” \nJohn Lodge performs Saturday at the House of Blues in Disney Springs. Tickets are $19-$35. Details at livenation.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T12:13:25.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
