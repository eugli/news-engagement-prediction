Uday Chopra invites Nargis Fakhri to join him in Rome Uday Chopra just asked Nargis Fakhri out to join him in Rome in April. What is going on? IndiaToday.in | Written by Devarsi Ghosh A + A - \nUday Chopra and Nargis Fakhri somehow manage to hit the headlines together. Kudos for that! \nAt one point, their rumoured relationship was the talk of Tinsel Town even though Uday and Nargis never admitted of being involved with each other. \nWATCH: Nargis Fakhri conned off Rs 6 lakh through fraudulent credit card transactions \nIn fact, it was earlier reported that Nargis had even quit Bollywood because of a broken heart but later, the actor denied it. \nTo be fair, it was Uday and Nargis's Twitter banter which led people to believe that there's something going on between them. \nNow, just a while ago, Uday Chopra invited Nargis Fakhri to join him in Rome in April! I wanna go to Rome in April @NargisFakhri wanna join me? â€” Uday Chopra (@udaychopra) February 2, 2017 \nIs it just one of those usual Uday-and-Nargis conversations on Twitter or is it something more? We can't wait to find out. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:32:00.655+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
