Source: Tweet \nThe second-placed Victory's two-goal lead evaporated in the 90th minute when Adelaide's Tarek Elrich pounced on some loose defending by Jason Geria. \nThe Reds continued to press their case but ran out of time to claim an equaliser, with Victory climbing to within eight points of ladder-leaders Sydney FC. \nâ€” Hyundai A-League (@ALeague) February 25, 2017 \nVictory had dominated most of the game but were unable to break through until the 65th minute, when Marco Rojas coolly converted a free kick. \nRojas sent a curling shot into the top corner from just outside the box after being brought down by Dylan McGowan, who was booked for the late challenge. \nThe star winger continued to cause headaches and almost scored again minutes later with a header that hit the crossbar. \nGun striker Berisha made it 2-0 in the 81st minute with a sublime finish off the outside of his foot from 12 yards. \nAlready the competition's leading goalscorer, Berisha also celebrated his 50th goal for Victory and 98th in the competition. \nHe had been kept quiet earlier but didn't waste his only clear opportunity of the game. \nA Victory goal had seemed inevitable in the first half but United's teenaged goalkeeper Daniel Margush saved his side's skin on several occasions.
