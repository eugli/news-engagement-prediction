And they hired a big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place. And we know how that turned out. The ratings went right down the tubes. It’s been a total disaster. And Mark will never ever bet against Trump again and I just want to pray for Arnold if we can — for those ratings, OK?\nIn response to the criticism, Schwarzenegger has posted a message to Twitter suggesting the two switch jobs.\n“Hey Donald, I have a great idea,” he said. “Why don’t we switch jobs as you’re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, so people can finally sleep comfortably again,” he said.\nThe National Prayer Breakfast? pic.twitter.com/KYUqEZbJIE\n— Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 2, 2017\nSchwarzenegger, who served as the Governor of California from 2003 to 2011, is known to have had genuine presidential ambitions.
