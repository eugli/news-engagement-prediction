Face your constituents. Hold town halls,” she said.\nThe Arizona Democrat’s statement refers to a letter Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, sent to his constituents, invoking the Giffords shooting as a reason not to hold a public town hall.\nGiffords, who survived a gunshot wound to the head, said town hall and constituent meetings were a “hallmark” of her tenure in Congress and that listening to her constituents was “the most basic and core tenant” of her job.\n\"I was shot on a Saturday morning,” she said. “By Monday morning my offices were open to the public. Ron Barber — at my side that Saturday, who was shot multiple times, then elected to Congress in my stead — held town halls. It's what the people deserve in a representative.”\nTown hall meetings this week have turned rowdy in some cases as constituents and activists are using them as a venue for protesting President Trump’s agenda. Some members have opted for telephone town halls or decided against holding them.\nGohmert told constituents that after Giffords was shot, the House Sergeant-at-Arms advised members that “civilian attendees” stand the greatest chance of being harmed or killed at congressional events, KLTV reported Tuesday . Telephone town halls allow him to communicate with more constituents, he wrote.\n“Unfortunately, at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety,” he wrote.\nThe 2011 shooting at Giffords’ “Congress on your Corner” event killed six of her constituents and wounded 12 others. It was the first assassination attempt on a member of Congress meeting with constituents.\nFollowing the shooting, Giffords and her husband, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, who are both gun owners, co-founded the gun-control group Americans for Responsible Solutions. In the past year, she has held more than 50 public events across the country to campaign for gun safety.\n“Many of the members of Congress who are refusing to hold town halls and listen to their constituents concerns are the very same politicians that have opposed commonsense gun violence prevention policies and have allowed the Washington gun lobby to threaten the safety of law enforcement and everyday citizens in our schools, businesses, places of worship, airports, and movie theaters,” her statement says.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/22/town-halls-republicans/98250238/", "http://gohmert.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398419", "http://www.kltv.com/story/34557384/gohmert-responds-to-group-calling-for-town-hall-meeting", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/14/some-congress-keep-angry-public-phone-lines-distance/97889920/", "http://americansforresponsiblesolutions.org/2017/02/23/townhall/"], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:30:13.276+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
