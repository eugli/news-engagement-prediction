While this was only the second time Weidman has stepped in front of the camera as an actor, Rutten admits he’s been very impressive thus far. \n“I love Chris,” Rutten told FOX Sports about his appearance on the show. “I was blown away by the first appearance from Chris, a guy that’s never acted before. I was tweeting about it, that’s how impressed I was. He was smiling, relaxed, having fun on camera, which is a very hard to do. It’s like going to a fight and not being nervous. You learn that over time but to do that as the first gig that he has and he pulls it off like that, he did a great job. \n“I was literally blown away. I remember my first acting job and it was not like that!” \nRutten says that Weidman was a natural in the role and it didn’t hurt that he had a comedian and actor like James by his side as he tried out acting for the first time. \nJames is a huge fan of the UFC and mixed martial arts in general and even did a fight-themed movie with “Here Comes the Boom” in 2012. \n“He had the best acting coach on set and that was Kevin James,” Rutten explained. “The reason I was shining in ‘Here Comes the Boom’ that was Kevin. If you have great people around you, great teachers, who make you aware of those little things that go wrong, those little criticisms and you take those because a lot of fighters have egos and nobody can tell you what to do but if you take that constructive criticism, it will make you a better actor.” \nGiven Weidman’s success through two episodes of “Kevin Can Wait” it looks like he might end up being invited back for a third at some point in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:06:48.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
