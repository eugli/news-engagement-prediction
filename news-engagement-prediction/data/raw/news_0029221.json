I understood why he had to go, though; he wants to save money, he wants to go home with his family, so I totally respect that. But I’m sure I’ll see him soon, He’s writing his music and I’m writing mine, so as soon as he’s free we’ll definitely catch up,” he told Reveal.

We got on really well, which was good.” \nHe also laughed off the idea his new bachelor pad would be the focus of wild parties now he’s living alone. \n“It’s more of a little safety zone,” he said. “It’s where I go back to chill out, but I do have friends over.” The pop wannabes have been forced to deny a romance between them (Photo: Copyright unknown) He and Freddy simple enjoy a \"bromance\", Matt insists \nExplaining their decision to move in together, a source said at the time: “The boys get on so well and were both planning on moving into London anyway so decided to move in together. \n“Matt’s not shy about telling people. He’s moving in with his best mate so he doesn’t see it as a big deal.” \nAnd Matt himself told Loose Women in December: \"I said 'I need someone to live with,' and he said 'I need someone to live with.' I said 'Are you clean?' and he said 'Yeah' and that was all I needed.’\" \nBut less than a month later, Freddy had moved out.

He’s doing his writing and he’s a bit far away. But at the moment we’re all so busy I don’t get to see anyone. We haven’t had a housewarming yet, just a few friends over for fajitas.” \nThe guys met on the 2016 series of X Factor , which wrapped in December with Matt being crowned the winner. Both of them are now pursuing solo music careers. \nMatt had a hit over the festive period with winner's song, When Christmas Comes Around, penned by Ed Sheeran, and is now working on his debut album. \nFreddy, meanwhile, is promoting a solo gig in London on 2 April.
