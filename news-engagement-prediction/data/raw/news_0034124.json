Modern politics is also about humanitarian assistance and development, not only “raising defence spending,” he added. \n“It [increasing military spending] has been the American message for many, many years. I am very much against letting ourselves be pushed into this,” Juncker said, speaking on the sidelines of the international Munich Security Conference on Wednesday. \nJuncker added that he does not like “our American friends narrowing down this concept of security to the military.” \nAccording to the EC president, a “modern stability policy” is made up of several parts. \n“If you look at what Europe is doing in defence, plus development aid, plus humanitarian aid, the comparison with the United States looks rather different. Modern politics cannot just be about raising defence spending,” he said. \n“Europeans must bundle their defence spending better and spend the money more efficiently,” he added. . @JunckerEU \"Don't accept that US narrows down 'security' to military expenses. #DevelopmentAid helps peace & stabilisation too\" #EuropeFirst pic.twitter.com/VzdAvrGQYY \nREAD MORE: Jean-Claude Juncker: ‘We will need to teach Trump what Europe is and how it works’ \nHis remarks came after US Secretary of Defense James Mattis warned NATO member states to increase military spending, otherwise Washington may “moderate” support for the alliance. \n“America cannot care more for your children’s future security than you do,” Mattis told NATO defense ministers, Reuters reported on Wednesday.

In November, the EC president fired a volley of criticism across the Atlantic, saying: “we will need to teach Trump what Europe is and how it works.” \n“I think we will waste two years before Mr. Trump tours the world he does not know… The election of Trump poses the risk of upsetting intercontinental relations in their foundation and in their structure,” Juncker said, addressing students at a conference in his home state, Luxembourg.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:26:04.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
