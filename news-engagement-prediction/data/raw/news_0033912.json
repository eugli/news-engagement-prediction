Bard corrected him: The police officers were in fact guests at the hotel, and the junkie was vacationing abroad. The tenant, it seems, had been misled by the stretcher, the corpse and the body bag.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The filmmaker Milos Forman, appearing in Abel Ferrara’s 2008 documentary “Chelsea on the Rocks,” teasingly asked Mr. Bard on camera whether any guest had ever died at his hotel. Mr. Bard cited just one, in 1988: the portrait painter Alphaeus Cole, who lived to be 112. He neglected to mention, among others, Dylan Thomas, who drank himself to death and was rushed to a hospital emergency room from the hotel in 1953, or Nancy Spungen, the girlfriend of Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, who was stabbed to death in their room in 1978. (He was charged with her murder but died of a heroin overdose while free on bail in 1979 before the case went to trial.) While Mr. Bard presided over it, the Chelsea was also home to Viva, the Andy Warhol film star; the artists Larry Rivers, Christo and Jeanne-Claude (Christo wrapped Jeanne-Claude, his wife, there); the singer-songwriters Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen (who wrote a song about it, “Chelsea Hotel #2”); and the punk rock musician Dee Dee Ramone (who caricatured Mr. Bard in a horror novel he wrote). The Chelsea was where Jack Kerouac worked on “On the Road,” where Arthur C. Clarke wrote “2001: A Space Odyssey,” where William Burroughs wrote “Naked Lunch” and where Bob Dylan wrote “Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.” Mr. Bard lent long-term tenants money and tolerated their overdue bills; he embraced their eccentricities and encouraged their cultural ambitions. When Timur Cimkentli, a photographer, owed back rent, Mr. Bard hired him as a bellman. Mr. Cimkentli told NPR in 2011 that Mr. Bard “was kind of like a huge leaf that kids could go under away from the storm, and that was the rarity of this hotel, that he would keep you on, he would see you, and you would owe him two months’ rent and you would cry to him and he would say, ‘Don’t worry, keep painting, keep painting.’” Arthur Miller, who wrote his play “After the Fall” there, recalled in the literary magazine Granta in 2002 that when he moved into the Chelsea in 1960, “I did not know quite what to make of Mr. Bard.” Photo The Chelsea Hotel.

Clary/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images “A blue-eyed Hungarian Jew,” Mr. Miller continued, “short and with a rather clear, delighted round face, full of energy, he waved a hand over the room saying: ‘Everything is perfect. All the furniture is brand new, new mattresses, drapes. Look in the bathroom.’ \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “As we walked to the bathroom, I noticed a worn path down the middle of the carpet and what felt like coal dust crunching under my shoes. ‘The carpet,’ I started to say, but he cut me off. ‘A new carpet is coming tomorrow,’ he said with raised index finger, and one knew he had not thought of replacing the carpet until that very minute.” Mr. Bard, Mr. Miller wrote, had a “talent for overriding probability, an emotional fluency which sent his thoughts on swallow loops from subject to subject, a progressive, enthusiastic view of life.
