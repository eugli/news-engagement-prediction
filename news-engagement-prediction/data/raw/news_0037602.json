The way the people are attending my rallies, I can say that I am going to form the next government. The people of the state want change as they are fed up with the misrule and goonda raj of SP,\" she said. \n\nIn a similar refrain, Singh, after casting his vote here, claimed that the BJP would secure an absolute majority in UP. \n\nAt Saifai, Akhilesh said, \"The voters have made up their minds in favour of the SP-Congress alliance.\" \n\nPolling in this phase began slowly but picked up pace later. There were reports of minor skirmishes between the supporters of the candidates at some polling booths. \nSP leader and Akhilesh's uncle Shivpal Yadav complained that his supporters were attacked by the \"political opponents\" in his Jaswantnagar constituency. \n\nIn the 2012 Assembly polls, the SP had won 55 of these 69 seats, while the BSP, BJP and Congress had secured only six, five and two seats respectively. One seat was won by an Independent. \n\nThere were 826 candidates in the fray in the third phase whose fate will be decided by 2.41 crore voters, including 1.10 crore women and 1,026 people belonging to the 'third gender' category.
