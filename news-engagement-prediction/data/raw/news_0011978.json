She played a 45-minute set of her hits, including the super-romantic ballad, \"Fall For You.\" Next up, Grammy-nominated singer Eric Benet, who boasted about being fit at 50 (and he is), thrilled the nearly 250 guests with his early hits, like \"Spend My Life,\" and \"Georgy Porgy\" and a few new ones from his upcoming album.\nThen DJ Biz Markie, who catapulted to fame with the 1989 hit \"Just a Friend,\" turned up the energy with an infectious set of old hip-hop hits from Prince to LL Cool J that got the grown and sexy crowd dancing like they did back in the day before careers and kids.\nPARTY TIME: Celebrations about around Houston ahead of Super Bowl\n\"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" reality stars NeNe Leaks and Cynthia Bailey, who slid into the VIP area undetected, eventually joined the dancing in the hotel's main ballroom. Actress LisaRaye McCoy (of VH1's \"Single Ladies\") worked the red carpet and then spent much of the night on the dance floor with NFL great Ray Lewis. (Lots of sparks there!)\nYes, it was a Super Bowl celebration, but the party also called attention to a greater cause - the fight against HIV/AIDS. Proceeds went to The T.R.U.T.H. Project and the American Foundation for Children with AIDS. Also, Pastors Rudy and Juanita Rasmus of St. John's Downtown church and Dr. Joseph Gathe were recognized for their work in the community in fighting the disease.\nThe event was produced by the family owned Pomp & Circumstance Extravagant Events, headed by Charlene Shackelford and Claudette Foreman, with Endicott & Company handling publicity.\nThe Super Bowl halftime show is on Sunday and Lady Gaga will be performing with hundreds of drones incorporated into her performance. Bruno Mars performed at the pre-Super Bowl show on Friday night where he performed an amazing concert that matched the energy he showed when he took the stage at halftime last year and in 2014. Performing on Club Nomadic in Houston, Mars danced and sang impressively while also rocking out on guitar throughout his high energy 90-minute set.\nMedia: Brandpoint >>>Click through the above
