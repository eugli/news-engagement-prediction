Use values from the periodic table: \nH is 1.01 grams per moleO is 16.00 grams per mole \nGet the molar mass by adding up all the masses of elements in the compound. The subscript after the hydrogen (H) indicates there are two atoms of hydrogen. There is no subscript after oxygen (O), which means only one atoms is present. \nmolar mass = (2 x 1.01) + 16.00molar mass = 18.02 \nNow, divide the mass of each element by the total mass to get the mass percentages: \nmass % H = (2 x 1.01) / 18.02 x 100%mass % H = 11.19%", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:41:46.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
