Meningitis and glandular fever. \nAccording to Dr Reynolds, these are two of the most frequently transmitted pathogens via kissing. You don't always know where they've been (Photo: Getty Images) \nGlandular fever is still referred to as the \"kissing disease\", so high is the risk of contagion. Its symptoms - often long-lasting - include extreme fatigue. \nWith meningitis , \"the inflammation of the membranes surrounding your brain and spinal cord, can last up to 10 days, sometimes causing permanent and even life-threatening damage.\" \n\"Neither conditions are remotely desirable.\" Glandular fever symptoms can hang around for up to sixth months (Photo: Getty) STIs \nSex Education may seem like a dim and distant memory, but as a refresher, microbes that cause gonorrhea, syphilis, herpes, and HPV can be transmitted through saliva. \nWhat makes this worse is that these infections can often be asymptomatic, meaning they get passed on easily and continuously between partners through just kissing. It may be worth talking about food allergies before you pucker up (Photo: Getty) Cavities \nWith dental plaque and cavities harbouring bacteria aplenty, Reynolds says the latter should be considered as being contagious. \nDon't let a partner's minty fresh breath fool you either, as anyone can have an oral infection, regardless of how pleasant their breath smells. Cavities can host all sorts of bacteria (Photo: Getty) Allergic reactions. \nA Swedish survey recently revealed how 12 per cent of people with a food allergy will kiss someone who triggers a reaction owing to the food they've eaten. \nThe likelihood of this is greater is your partner has just eaten that item of food, but it also depends on the severity of the allergy, which can include hives, facial swelling, shortness of breath, and vomiting that can occur within minutes of exposure. \nIt's not the most romantic conversation in the world, but it might be advisable to bring any allergies to your partner's attention.
