According to TheWrap , the director is now set to helm Bubbles , a stop-motion animated feature about Michael Jackson’s pet chimpanzee Bubbles. “It’s an idea that fascinates me and one I want to develop further,” Waititi said in a statement. “Most people know I’m a huge Michael Jackson fan, so the main thing for me is to make sure it’s respectful of him and his legacy. I’m not interested in making a biopic; I want to focus on telling a story that blends fact and fantasy, about an animal trying to make sense of the world.” “It’s about an animal trying to make sense of the world.” Bubbles was Jackson’s pet and companion from the 1980s into the ‘90s, accompanying the singer on trips and tours and even joining him for tea with the likes of Elizabeth Taylor and the mayor of Osaka, Japan. However, by the time he’d grown into an adult, he was proving too much to handle, so he eventually moved to the Center for Great Apes in Wauchula, Florida, where he lives to this day. All this must sound too weird to turn into a movie, but Waititi is building a name for himself as a director with a particularly off-kilter sensibility. He earned critical acclaim for 2014’s What We Do In the Shadows , a mockumentary about four vampires living in a New Zealand suburb. His upcoming take on Thor in Thor: Ragnarok promises to be equally far out . For instance, it features Jeff Goldblum as the Grandmaster, one of the oldest beings in the universe. We’re looking forward for how he approaches this weird corner of the King of Pop’s life.
