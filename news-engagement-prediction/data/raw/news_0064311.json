However, the law expired on September 13, 2004, after Congress failed to reauthorize it. 1997 \nThe U.S. Supreme Court, in the case of Printz v. United States , declares the background check requirement of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act unconstitutional. \nThe Florida Supreme Court upholds a jury's $11.5 million verdict against Kmart for selling a gun to and intoxicated man who used the gun to shoot his estranged girlfriend. \nMajor American gun manufacturers voluntarily agree to include child safety trigger devices on all new handguns. 1998 - June \nA Justice Department report indicates the blocking of some 69,000 handgun sales during 1977 when the Brady Bill pre-sale background checks were required. 1998 – July \nAn amendment requiring a trigger lock mechanism to be included with every handgun sold in the U.S. is defeated in the Senate. \nBut, the Senate approves an amendment requiring gun dealers to have trigger locks available for sale and creating federal grants for gun safety and education programs. 1998 – October \nNew Orleans becomes the first U.S. city to file suit against gun makers, firearms trade associations, and gun dealers.
