It's always the Florida man. This time it was 75-year-old Tony Aarts who was playing Magnolia Landing Golf & Country Club in North Fort Myers recently when he was dragged into the water by an alligator. \nI repeat, a 75-year-old man trying to get a round of golf in was dragged into the water by a 10-foot alligator. \n\"As I was walking about 5 to 6 feet away from the water I heard a splash, and as soon as I heard that splash I knew it was an alligator, and he got me,\" Aarts told WPTV.com . \n\"I remember having a club in my hand, and as soon as he had me in the water up to my waist, I started hitting him over the head. I seen (sic) the size of him, you know you can just see the claws as he was pulling me back and I'm heeling in trying to go the other way and he's just looking at me and I'm looking at him. So I started hitting him in the eye socket, I hit him three times and he let go of my foot. So I crawled back and by that time the guys ... they were there.\" \nAarts went on to say that he used a Cleveland putter to deliver the beating and that the gator was dragged out an hour after the incident. He had some damage done to his foot, but he will be fine. Hopefully Cleveland gives him a lifetime contract to play its clubs.
