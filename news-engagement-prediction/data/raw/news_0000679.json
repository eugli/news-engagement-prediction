In the recent past, we have so many examples of how B-town divas have opened up about their pregnancy and haven’t shied away from the eyes of paparazzi. Take Lisa Haydon and Shveta Salve for example. They used social media and flaunted their baby bump as they announced that they were expecting. Even Kareena Kapoor Khan has done several photoshoots before Taimur Ali Khan was born. She actually became a revolution as she was the first actress to have stepped out so often and done chat shows, attended red carpet, done an ad shoot and even featured on several magazines! \nAnyway, what are your thoughts on Beyonce’s steamy pregnancy photoshoot?
