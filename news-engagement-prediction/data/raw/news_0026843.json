The Suits actress, who also runs a lifestyle brand and blog called The Tig , explained on the site how she prefers to spend the romantic holiday. \"I think you need to be your own Valentine,\" Markle wrote. \"I think you need to cook that beautiful dinner even when it's just you, wear your favorite outfit, buy yourself some flowers, and celebrate the self love that often gets muddled when we focus on what we don't have.\"\nGetty The post was originally published in 2015 and shared again today, but her message of self-care is nonetheless important. Later in the essay, the actress reveals how she plans to spend the day (though this was written two years ago), which included spending time with her girls and treating herself.\n\"This Valentine's Day I will be with friends, running amock through the streets of New York, likely imbibing some cocktail that's oddly pink, and jumping over icy mounds in my new shoes through the salted snowy streets of the West Village,\" she added.", "external_links": ["http://thetig.com/", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/45/980x490/gallery-1479067525-prince-harry-meghan-markle3.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/45/768x384/gallery-1479067525-prince-harry-meghan-markle3.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/49/1600x800/gallery-1481135870-hbz-meghan-markle-index.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/45/640x320/gallery-1479067525-prince-harry-meghan-markle3.jpg", "http://hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/45/480x240/gallery-1479067525-prince-harry-meghan-markle3.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-15T07:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:23:03.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
