Garry McCarthy and two other former cops in the couple’s contentious divorce case.\nThat’s the argument lawyers for former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. made this week, disputing former Ald. Sandi Jackson’s argument that the subpoenas her husband issued to McCarthy and the other two men were harassment and “a fishing expedition.”\nThose three subpoenas were issued last month because of “admissions made by Sandra to Jesse, statements made to Jesse by multiple family members, close friends and former colleagues of both parties, and other information in his possession,” the former congressman’s attorneys said in a Tuesday filing in Cook County Circuit Court.\n“Jesse’s discovery was targeted, tailored, and has a more than sufficient nexus to the factual disputes in this case to survive Sandra’s Motion,” the filing stated.\nSandi Jackson is aiming to block Jesse Jackson Jr. from getting information from former Chicago top cop McCarthy and two others as part of the couple’s divorce — but the former congressman is fighting back, the latest filings show.\nJesse Jackson’s lawyers this week sought to discredit her motion, which objects to the validity of the subpoenas Jesse Jackson Jr. issued to McCarthy; Rick Simon, a former Chicago Police sergeant who now runs a cleaning company with city contracts, and former Chicago Police Officer James Love.\n“Sandra does not specify, beyond her categorical and dogmatic assertion, any facts (competent or otherwise) that would provide the necessary good cause to quash the aforementioned subpoenas,” Jesse Jackson Jr.’s attorneys said in the latest filing.\nSandi Jackson’s attorneys filed a Jan. 26 motion to quash the three already-issued subpoenas as well as another subpoena Jesse Jackson’s lawyers have said they planned to issue.\n“The issuance and filing in the public record of unwarranted subpoenas full of unsupported innuendo can serve no constructive purpose to the parties or their children,” the Jan. 26 filing states. “Instead, this deliberate course of conduct reveals an improper intent to try this case in the media rather than before this Honorable Court.”\nBoth McCarthy and Simon have said they see no reason why they’ve been dragged into her divorce case. McCarthy’s lawyer has said McCarthy has nothing to do with the case.\nOn Jan. 31, Judge Carole Kamin Bellows issued stays to all three men who were subpoenaed “until further order of the court.”\nA hearing is set for Feb. 27 to rule on Sandi Jackson’s motion to quash the subpoenas, as well as Jesse Jackson’s motion to issue another subpoena. In an order Tuesday, Bellows extended the “discovery” period in the case — the period in which both sides exchange evidence — to March 1.\nSandi Jackson, a former 7th Ward alderman on the South Side, and Jesse Jackson Jr. both pleaded guilty in August 2013 to various schemes relating to the looting of his congressional campaign fund. The former alderman and the former 2nd Congressional District lawmaker each went to prison for diverting $750,000 from campaign funds for their personal use between 2005 and 2012.\nThe former congressman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit false statements and mail and wire fraud; his wife to filing a false federal income tax return.\nThe Jackson divorce case is playing out in two jurisdictions. Sandi Jackson filed for divorce in Washington, D.C., where she is living with the couple’s two children.\nLawyers for Jesse Jackson Jr. earlier this month said they’ll fight to keep his divorce case in Illinois, arguing former Ald. Sandi Jackson committed “acts” in Illinois that gave rise to the divorce.\nCb Domestic Relations – 2-21-2017 – Certificate of Mailing Filed – Answer to Motion Filed – Notice of Fili… by Scott Fornek on Scribd", "external_links": ["https://www.scribd.com/document/340051926/Cb-Domestic-Relations-2-21-2017-Certificate-of-Mailing-Filed-Answer-to-Motion-Filed-Notice-of-Filing-Filed-1#from_embed", "https://www.scribd.com/user/259863564/Scott-Fornek#from_embed"], "published": "2017-02-22T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:27:35.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
