All SeaWorlds have since agreed to not breed the creatures, making those in captivity their last generation. Long been an issue: Almost as soon as she posed the video, hundreds of people flooded her Instagram with comments about the cruelty of forcing the animals to perform for the star's amusement, something SeaWorld has been criticised for The changes follow a public outcry about the treatment of the aquatic mammals fanned by documentary film Blackfish, which was released in 2013 and told the story of Tilikum. Tilikum - who died this month - was involved in three human deaths and was kept in isolation. Despite all this, the singer and her football star husband took her son Future for a private orca show.

Despite thousands of comments, Ciara - who is expecting hers and Russell's first child together - did not remove the video or explain why she decided to attend the orca show.
