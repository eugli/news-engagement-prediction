Why include a visual of the fighting pits in the blink-and-you’d-miss-it trip to Earth-2’s African locale if not to use them someday? \nOver the course of the next two episodes, The Flash will grant that wish, taking viewers inside Gorilla City during Tuesday’s episode, where we’ll get a chance to see how Grodd (voiced by David Sobolov) has fared since falling under the rule of Solovar (voiced by Keith David), a fellow sentient gorilla and the leader of Gorilla City. \n“We saw, at one point in season 2, a little tease of Gorilla City,” Grant Gustin tells EW. “A lot of people probably didn’t even see it, but off far in the distance, you see hundreds of gorillas marching in Gorilla City, so we’re going to see a little bit of that.” \nAfter Harry Wells (Tom Cavanagh) is abducted by Grodd, Jesse Quick (Violett Beane) enlists the help of Barry (Gustin), Caitlin (Danielle Panabaker), Cisco (Carlos Valdes), and Julian (Tom Felton) on a voyage to Gorilla City to get him back. But this isn’t a vacation by any means. “The viewers can always expect Cisco to have one of a handful of reactions,” Valdes jokes. “I’ve got it down to a formulaic science now, but I think the path that’s being chosen for these Grodd episodes is definitely one of fear, because when you suddenly find yourself in the cold African jungles of Earth-2 and you hear the sound of omnipresent gorillas roaring at you, it kind of makes you shake in your boots. So, there’s definitely some fear to be played with there. It’s scary.” \n“There are lots and lots and lots of gorillas, more than we’ve ever seen before,” Gustin adds, teasing that the fighting pit may finally be put to good use. “We have this really, really, really cool gladiator moment for Barry in this really cool arena that the gorillas have.” \nHowever, it may not be Grodd with whom Barry is fighting. According to the logline for Tuesday’s episode, Grodd has lured Team Flash in to get help in preventing Solovar from invading Earth-1 — whether that’s true, however, remains to be seen. “We’ve always had that element with Grodd,” Gustin says. “Like him and Caitlin have that connection, and there’s some really vulnerable qualities there with Grodd where he was manipulated from a young age and set on this path that made him this insane villain telepathic gorilla. He’s had his reasons for all his choices as well. You do see a different side of Grodd, but still Grodd.” The CW \nThe trip may also provide an opportunity for some dual Wells moments, as Valdes promises as much in upcoming episodes — though he didn’t specifically say which. “There’s an episode coming up that has a lot of Harry-HR interplay, and it’s not just entertaining for the audience, but it’s also entertaining for me to watch Tom Cavanagh play two different characters, literally shoulder to shoulder with me, and me having to play with both of these figures,” Valdes says. “It’s one of those moments where you have to step back, not just as an actor, but also as a character, and say, ‘This is weird, right? This is weird.'” \nThe Flash airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW.
