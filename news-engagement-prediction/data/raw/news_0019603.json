Jha Feb 7, 2017 - 10:48 am IST 0 0 \nIt’s okay to poke good natured fun at the judiciary. But not ok to name the city. This is the message that the censor board has sent across loud and clear to the makers of Jolly LLB 2 . \nThe film is set in Lucknow. But all dialogues taking light-hearted digs at the city of cuisine and courtesy have been asked to be removed. In spoken lines referring to the city that go, “Lucknow kachahari mein koi cheez time pe hui hai kya?”(has anything in the courts of Lucknow happened on time?) and “Baahar Lucknow ke lawyer mujhe kya bulaate hain” (what do lawyers outside Lucknow call me), the name of the city has been replaced by ‘Local’. \nIn another line of dialogue, “Yeh Delhi nahin Lucknow hai”, Lucknow has been ordered out and replaced by ‘Awadh’. \nThe name of the city has also been muted from the Holi song Go paagal . A source close to the development says, “The censor board wanted ‘Punjab’ removed from Udta Punjab. The makers had to go to court to keep the same. Now it’s ‘Udta Lucknow’. They’ve deleted ‘Lucknow’ from Jolly LLB 2 . At this rate our filmmakers would have to set all their films in a no man’s land.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:02:30.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
