Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nIt's the best flippin' news of the week - a Manchester restaurant is about to throw a week long pancakes and prosecco party. \nThe humble pancake usually gets just one day a year in its honour - Shrove Tuesday , which this year falls on February 28. \nBut one Manchester restaurant is extending its moment of glory by laying on a decadent week of indulgent pancakes served up with a glass of prosecco. \nThe Annual Pancake Party event is hosted by national chain Bill's, which has a restaurant on John Dalton Street, and features a variety of new toppings and fillings all served with a pile of buttermilk pancakes. \nYou can get free prosecco and beer at Common in the Northern Quarter \nAt brunch, lunch, and dinner time, the pancakes and prosecco combinations available will include the Lemon Cheesecake with vanilla ice cream and maple syrup, and the Banana Split stack of caramelized banana, a trio of strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream, three sauces (dark chocolate, salted caramel, and strawberry sauce) and a whipped cream topping. \nThe pancakes and prosecco event begins on February 20 and runs until February 28, and diners can bag themselves this feast from £10 with a voucher from the official Bill's Restaurant website (not valid February 25-26).

They are available with prosecco daily from midday. Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:05:37.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
