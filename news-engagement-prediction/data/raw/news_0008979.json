I know exactly where I put it,” Brady said, according to USA Today , from the Patriots’ locker room. \nBrady said he alerted the security staff and the Patriots team managers, and was still feverishly looking for it as he was talking to the outlet.

Not good.” \nBrady left the locker room without finding the No. 12 he wore during the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history, leading the Patriots back from a 28-3 second-half deficit. \n“It is going to be on eBay soon, I guess,” Brady said.
