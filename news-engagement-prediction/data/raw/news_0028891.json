Money transfer company WorldRemit analyzed internal data of who sends money to its top 10 recipient countries. It said Monday that Filipinos in Germany were the most generous, sending home on average $32.5 more than usual before or after Valentine's Day week last year. Following closely were Filipinos in Norway who sent $24 more, and New Zealand, who remitted $12.5 more. Comparative government data isn't available.
