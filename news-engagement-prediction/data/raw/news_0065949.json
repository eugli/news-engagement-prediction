Getty By Gina Mei Feb 22, 2017 Shortly after the election last November, Allan Lichtman — the American University professor who has accurately predicted every presidential election since 1984 — appeared on CNN to offer a very different kind of prediction: that President Donald Trump would be impeached before the end of his first term . Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Now, to prove just how dedicated he is to this prediction, he's decided to write a whole book about it, called The Case for Impeachment . Throughout the book, the political historian — who once predicted Trump's surprising victory — will map out why he thinks the president is destined for failure. Citing everything from his many potential conflicts of interest to his potential ties to Russia, Lichtman hopes to argue \"that it is not a question of if President Trump will be impeached, but a question of when,\" HarperCollins spokesperson Shelby Meizlik HarperCollins said in a statement on Tuesday. As multiple sources point out, Lichtman has voiced his belief that Trump would be impeached even before he was officially elected. “I'm going to make another prediction,” he told The Washington Post in September. “This one is not based on a system; it's just my gut. They don't want Trump as president, because they can't control him. He's unpredictable. They'd love to have Pence — an absolutely down-the-line, conservative, controllable Republican. And I'm quite certain Trump will give someone grounds for impeachment, either by doing something that endangers national security or because it helps his pocketbook.” Professor who predicted Trump would win, now says \"there's a very good chance\" he will be impeached https://t.co/RgWZNMwMqu During his interview with CNN in November, he echoed these beliefs again.

He is a loose canon. Nobody knows what he really believes or really where he stands. He can't be controlled. The Republicans would vastly prefer to have Mike Pence, an absolutely predictable down-the-pipe conservative Republican.\" The Case for Impeachment is set to be published by Dey Books on April 18.
