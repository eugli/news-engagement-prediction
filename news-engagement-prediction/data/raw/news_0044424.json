By Diana Nelson Jones / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nYou can pick a seat in the church pew or in the row of auditorium seats along the window to wait for a haircut at the Humble Barber in Brighton Heights. \nYou can study the retro memorabilia while you’re waiting — a framed photo of Ernest Tubb, a TV console from the ’60s, a stack of LPs, the barber products in the nooks of antique wooden cubbies, the 1968 barber chair no one sits in, a register of attendance and offering from a church that lists the prices of a shave, a beard trim and a haircut ($15, $10 and $15, respectively). \nYou can listen to your own music through ear buds while you wait, but no one does. Bradly Richards, the guy with the scissors, has the best playlist. \nYou might listen for 20 or 40 minutes or an hour before it’s your turn, but of the many hours spent waiting in life, this is one of the good ones. \nMy hair had gotten scroungy by the time I finally found some time on a recent weekday. The shop, which opened two years ago Tuesday, is closed on weekends. When I walked in, Mr. Richards was cutting a lustrous head of hair and talking to its owner about stuff. \n“There’s coffee,” he said. \nTwo thermoses and a row of mugs sat on the table in front of the pew. Two people were waiting ahead of me for a trim and soon another customer, Brad Kovach, walked in. \n“Hat’s on backward and no coat!” Mr. Richards said. \n“Left it at my buddy’s.” \n“Well take one from the rack.” \nTwo coats hung on an antique coat tree near the door. \nSoon, Craig Paris, a regular who lives nearby, walked in. \n“There’s coffee,” Mr. Richards said. \n“Magic word,” Mr. Paris said. \nThere’s a thing about barber shops that attracts men, even if they aren’t getting a haircut. It’s an excuse for a social session that a lot of guys don’t carve out for themselves otherwise, but, as Mr. Paris said, “the aesthetics alone make this place worth it.” \nI’ve always been the only female waiting for a haircut there, and it’s a fair assumption that the few females who go to barbers would say the same. We are few, but we are smart. \nOn a friend’s recommendation, I went the first time, tired of paying much more for a trim of my very short hair than men pay for theirs, and have been back for every subsequent trim. \nMr. Richards used to be a barista at The Vault, a cafe in a former bank building in Brighton Heights. It closed around 2008. \n“I was always looking for a traditional barber, but so many had died or retired,” he said. \nHe decided to be the barber he was always looking for. He left his job at The Vault to go to barber school. \nMr. Richards uses a barber chair from 1932, in a shade of green that isn’t found in nature, with an iron foot rest that rocks like the treadle of an old sewing machine. \nPaul Barnard was sitting in it when a song came on that gave me a teeny-bopper flashback. \n“Hey Brad,” I asked, “What’s that song?” \nAffecting an announcer’s tone, he said, “‘When Love Comes Knocking at Your Door’ by the Monkees.” \nAnd I thought my playlist was all over the map. \nWhile waiting for a haircut last year, I listened in on a conversation the barber had with a nearby resident about his garden. Another time, I eavesdropped on a conversation about a guy’s family, and, most recently, discussions about Las Vegas and a customer’s upcoming job interview. \nThere was a group discussion about what society is going to do about fake information, a musing about which Monkee was singing lead on that song. More coffee offered, more poured. \nWhen Mr. Kovach finally got in the chair, I was talking to Mr. Paris. \n“I used to go to salons for the color,” he said. “I’m a regular here now, but not as regular as I’d like to be” because of the limited hours. “I wouldn’t care if someone charged $5, I’d still come here. It’s the people.” \nDiana Nelson Jones: or 412-263-1626.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:48:20.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
