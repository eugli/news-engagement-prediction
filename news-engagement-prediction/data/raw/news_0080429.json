And that was 25 years ago,” said Daugherty. \nBut then, renewed hope arrived in the mail January 5. \n“Congratulations. We’ve confirmed there is a match in the Florida Adoption Registry,” said Daugherty. \nThe match she received was for her younger sister, Rhonda Rast. \nThe two sisters have been talking over the phone everyday since Daugherty received the letter. \nRast drove from Florida to Texas to meet her sister. \nMore good news filled the meeting of a lifetime. \n“We’re moving to Texas!” exclaimed Rast. “I’m very happy. Very satisfied. I get to meet the sister I’ve been wanting to meet for many years. I get to learn about my family and where I come from.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T07:09:01.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
