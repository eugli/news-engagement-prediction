(Photo: NBC, Will Heath/NBC) \nHere's something you don't expect from a Totino's pizza rolls commercial: a French lesbian love story. \nBut that's the turn that Saturday Night Live 's skit takes after a housewife (Vanessa Bayer) meets her husband's friend's sister ( SNL host Kristen Stewart). Instead of serving snacks as planned, the women embrace, spray each other with water, say sweet nothings in French and make out. So, no, the \"hungry guys\" never get their Totino's. \nThe commercial is the third in a series of Super Bowl-timed Totino's parodies SNL has done starring Bayer. \nIn 2015, the commercial had a \"Super Bowl Activity Pack\" that was \"full of fun little puzzles and games to keep my mind active,\" said Bayer. \nIn 2016, the ad took a creepy, X Files -style turn when Bayer realized her guys were watching a blank screen.
