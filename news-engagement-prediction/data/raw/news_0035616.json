Among moves since his inauguration, Trump has restated his campaign pledge to build a wall at the Mexican border and issued an executive order — now stalled by the courts — that puts a travel ban in place for those from a list of countries that are predominantly Muslim. \nLast week, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency arrested more than 680 people, including 253 in the Midwest and 50 in the Chicago area. The agency claimed the effort was routine and that 70 to 75 percent of those brought in had been convicted of committing violent crimes. Elgin Fresh Market Mike Danahey / The Courier-News \nA sign on the door of the Elgin Fresh Market on the city's east side noted the business was closed Thursday for the \"Day Without Immigrants.\" \nA sign on the door of the Elgin Fresh Market on the city's east side noted the business was closed Thursday for the \"Day Without Immigrants.\" (Mike Danahey / The Courier-News) \nGarcia said that reports he read stated that just one of those taken in by ICE last week was from Elgin. \nWhile the raids might seem routine, how they differ from past ones are the stories popping up of others beyond violent criminals and gang members being arrested and deported, Garcia said. \nHe noted the story of an Arizona woman who was deported after appearing for her routine ICE check-in. According to reports, Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos had been caught using a false Social Security number eight years ago and had been checking in with the agency since then but was sent back to Mexico recently after spending 21 years in the United States. \nAs for how many people and businesses took part in \"Day Without Immigrants\" in the Elgin area, Garcia said that was not easy to determine. \n\"One of the problems is the day came about very suddenly,\" Garcia said. \"There hasn't been much time to get the word out.\" \nOn Elgin's east side, closed places included Velasquez Mufflers & Brakes; restaurants Los Comales, Las Gorditas De Don Angel and Cilantro Grill; La Michoacana ice cream parlors; Armando's grocery store; and the two Elgin Fresh Market grocery stores. The Fresh Market in Carpentersville closed at 1 p.m. Thursday, according to a sign posted on the door.

They were willing to take that risk.\" \nMary Fergus, director of school and community relations for Elgin School District U46, said districtwide attendance was down 8 percent from Wednesday, when it stood at 93 percent. \nA few schools saw attendance drop close to 30 percent, Fergus said. Garfield Elementary in Elgin dropped from 93 percent to 63 percent. In Hanover Park, Laurel Hill Elementary saw attendance drop from 93 percent Wednesday to 63 percent Thursday, and Ontarioville Elementary went from 96 percent to 67 percent. \nThe principals with whom Fergus spoke told her that some parents mentioned their kids weren't going in because of \"Day Without Immigrants.\" \n\"It's always the parent's right to make that call\" as to whether or not their child will go to school on a given day, Fergus said. \nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2010, 43.6 percent of Elgin's population identified as Hispanic or Latino, and another 5.4 percent identified themselves solely as being of Asian descent. \nSince the end of 2007, the number of foreign-born workers employed in the U.S. has climbed by nearly 3.1 million to 25.9 million; they account for 56 percent of the increase in U.S. employment over that period, according to the Labor Department. The foreign-born — who include American citizens, green-card holders and those working without legal authorization — tend to be younger and to take jobs in fields that have been growing fastest, including restaurants, hotels and stores. \nRoughly 12 million people are employed in the restaurant industry, and immigrants make up the majority — up to 70 percent in places like New York and Chicago, according to Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, which works to improve working conditions. An estimated 1.3 million in the industry are immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, the group said. \nThe construction industry also employs large numbers of immigrants. \nAs for how many immigrants are living in the United States, the Pew Research Center put the number at about 11.1 million in 2014. Mexicans made up about 52 percent of those 2014 numbers, but their numbers have been declining this decade. Pew reported that from 2009 to 2014, 1 million Mexicans left the United States for Mexico, while 870,000 Mexicans came to the United States. \nThe Associated Press and Courier-News reporter Rafael Guerrero contributed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:49:43.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
