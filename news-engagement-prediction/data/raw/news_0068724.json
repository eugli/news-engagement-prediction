What's more it has helped to improve the safety for border agents.\nThe GAO found that older, \"legacy\" fencing, has been easily beaten by illegals. Sometimes they dig under it or cut a hole in it. Some lower fences are breached by the construction of makeshift bridges, allowing cars and trucks to flow over. Parts of the fencing is so old that debris has build up at the bottom, making it easy to climb over. And finally, the GAO said that huge groups of illegals can beat older fencing.\nOne section of the report, filled with photographs of damaged fencing, revealed the disrepair:\nWhile contractors provide routine maintenance and address urgent repairs on tactical infrastructure (TI), certain TI assets used by Border Patrol become degraded beyond repair and must be replaced. For example, in the Yuma sector, Border Patrol officials identified portions of primary legacy pedestrian fencing that had become so degraded by illegal entrants digging underneath the fencing and land erosion in the area that it required additional support to remain erect. In addition, Border Patrol officials in the El Paso sector stated that while CBP provides routine maintenance and repair services to the primary legacy pedestrian fencing in Sunland Park, New Mexico, significant weather events have eroded the foundation of the fencing. In addition, the erosion in the area has caused damage to nearby roads used by agents to conduct border security operations. Sector officials identified, and we observed, primary legacy pedestrian fencing that leans toward Mexican territory and that required additional support to prevent the fencing from collapsing. Sector officials noted that that due to the erosion and terrain in the area, they have been limited in their repair efforts. \nPresident Trump and Republicans in Congress are planning to push for plans to repair and finish the border wall, a price that could reach $16 billion. \nAlso from the Washington Examiner Paul Ryan mixes border tour with district visits, fundraisers He attended fundraisers, roundtables and meetings with community members in Florida, Texas and California.\nBy Susan Ferrechio â€¢ 02/22/17 11:30 PM   \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:00:40.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
