CEN 1 A family found this naked woman asleep in bed next to their toddler in their house \nCasma, whose husband was out at the time, told how she put her kids to bed at 9.15pm before going to sleep herself. \nBut she said she soon awoke to a chilling surprise. \nCasma said: “My youngest child is four years old and she sleeps in our room on a separate mattress. \n“She was sleeping peacefully until my husband arrived home and woke me up – asking who the person sleeping next to our little girl was.” \nThe mysterious intruder – who was naked – gave no response when they asked her how she had got into the house or what she was doing there. \nThe family were left baffled after insisting all the windows and doors were closed and securely locked. \nSome in the community have blamed witchcraft for the unexplained intrusion. \nDr Sylvester Hlathi, Southern Africa Development Community leader of traditional healers, said he could not be sure if the woman had mental problems or was being used by witches.
