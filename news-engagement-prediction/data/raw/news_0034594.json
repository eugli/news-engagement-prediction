The blades glow with 900 vibrant colors, which are curated based on text messages from passersby.\n“We’re delighted to again commission New American Public Art to work with us on an activation that achieves our goal of providing engaging wintertime entertainment for Bostonians and visitors,” said Jesse Brackenbury, the Greenway’s executive director, in a news release. “Color Commons provides a terrific opportunity to pair The Greenway’s free wifi network … with an innovative local design studio as passionate about interactive experiences as we are.”\nThe “Color Commons” exhibit opens tonight, and will be on display throughout the winter.\nThe Color Commons exhibit. —Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy", "external_links": ["http://www.newamericanpublicart.com/", "http://www.rosekennedygreenway.org/"], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:19:20.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
