As indicated by earlier reports, the next iPhone’s screen will go edge-to-edge, lacking a bezel, meaning more screen space in the same physical form factor. \nBut because of the lack of a Home button, Kuo says that Apple is preparing some still-mysterious alternatives to the TouchID fingerprint lock common to current iPhone models. \nOtherwise, new features expected in the next iPhone include an energy-efficient high-resolution OLED screen, a bigger battery , and wireless charging . All of those features will carry a hefty price tag, as the new iPhone could cost as much as $1,000 . \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
