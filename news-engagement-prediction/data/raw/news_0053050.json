The order requires Brown to stay at least 100 yards away from Tran, her mother and her brother. \nEarlier this month, Brown posted a telling video on Instagram shamelessly revealing his propensity to not let his exes go . \n“Ladies, y’all be complaining about n—as being, like, stalkers and in love with y’all, kinda crazy and s–t and you get tired of them. Well, guess what? I’m one of them n—as! If I love you, bitch, ain’t nobody gonna have you. I’m gonna make you miserable. I’m gonna chase that n—a out. I’m gonna chase your ass around,” he said. \nBrown, who seemingly shot the video poolside, said he just can’t let go. \n“If I love you, bitch, ain’t nobody gonna have you. F–k that!” he added. “I’m tearing up everything.” \nBrown’s reps did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
