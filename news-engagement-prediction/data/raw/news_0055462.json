Peters, Eric Lichtblau and Jo Becker twitter TWEET More \nWashington : Republican President Donald Trump's administration is expected to revoke landmark guidelines issued to public schools in defence of transgender student rights, despite a fight over a draft order that pitted Attorney General Jeff Sessions against the secretary of education, Betsy DeVos. \nMrs DeVos initially resisted signing off on the order and told President Donald Trump that she was uncomfortable with it, according to three Republicans with direct knowledge of the internal discussions. The order would reverse the directives put in place last year by the Obama administration to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice.

The order must come from the Justice and Education departments. \nMr Trump sided with his attorney general, these Republicans said. And Mrs DeVos, faced with the choice of resigning or defying the president, has agreed to go along. The Justice Department declined to comment Wednesday. SHARE Betsy DeVos, secretary of education, argued against the change. Photo: Bloomberg \nThough an official order from the administration was expected to be released as early as Wednesday, the two secretaries were still disputing the final language. \n\"We are hearing that it will be rescinded today,\" said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality.
