Norbert Reiser \nReiser's home-built controller system. \nThe couple moved from Bavaria in Germany in 2001 and it took Norbert eight years to reconfigure his home's power circuit.

Murray Wilson/ Fairfax NZ. \nThe $15,000 system converts sunlight into power and servicing all household appliances. \n\"It was one of my main reasons to come to New Zealand, not only is it a lovely place, but I could live my dream to be self-sufficient with my own electric energy,\" Reiser said. \n\"The rising power consumption from a rising Kiwi population creates a lot of stress to our hydro generators and water resources. \n\"The price of petrol and energy will never go down anymore so being self-sufficient helps. From my perspective this is the same price, on investment, than you would get on the grid.\" \nThe unit converts energy from sunlight into electricity, which is then stored in two batteries under Reiser's house. Ad Feedback \nIn winter a wetback heats the hot water cylinder so power can be preserved. Water is circulated through pipes and is heated using heat from the fire. \nReiser, an industrial electrician by trade, said the couple cooked on a gas stove with only the fridge and freezer running full-time. \nIn case of an emergency they have a back-up generator. In six years they've only had to use it three times. \n\"It's for if the weather is really bad – if we have maybe five, six days of constant rain,\" he said. \nResier intended to build a 3sqm garage where he could install more solar panels. The aim was to rely less on two storage batteries. \n\"I can prove that it is possible to build a self-sufficient house off the grid,\" he said. \n\"I built my own controller circuits and got the main parts from the electronic shops, like inverters, power meters for inlet and outlet. \n\"It is like being the conductor of an orchestra – all these components then get alternated to my specific needs.\" \nLiving off solar energy required people to be on their toes and thinking all the time with an understanding of how to use energy wisely, he said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:38:41.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
