I think they're waiting for me to offer a hot dog too.' Ranieri made the offer to his players before they finally kept their first clean sheet of the season in a 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace in October. 'I pay for pizza, you pay for the sausage. I am the sausageman.' Ranieri after being told a Leicester butcher had created a sausage in his honour. 'Before I was 'The Tinkerman' and now itâ€™s too much the same!' Former Chelsea manager reacted with incredulity to reports that he was not rotating his players enough. Ranieri had been backed by the club earlier this month, but has now been sacked 'This is not a footballer. This is a fantastic horse.' How Ranieri described Vardy in an interview to US website the Players' Tribune. 'Robert De Niro would be good!' Ranieri's was asked who he would like to see play him in a movie about Leicester striker Jamie Vardy. 'Why can't we continue to run, run, run? We are like Forrest Gump. Leicester is Forrest Gump.' In December, Ranieri compared his side to a memorable Tom Hanks film character. Ranieri has been dismissed with Leicester just a point outside the relegation zone 'I say my team is like the RAF, it's fantastic - whoosh whoosh! - I love it.' Marc Albrighton, Jamie Vardy and Jeff Schlupp were named as three of the fastest players in the Premier League. 'It's important not to look down or behind you. Like a climber, you need to look up. If you look down, you go, 'Oh! My God, look where we are!'' Ranieri told his players to remain focused as Leicester continued to set the pace. 'From the beginning when something was wrong I've been saying: 'Dilly-ding, dilly-dong, wake up, wake up!' So on Christmas Day I bought for all the players and all the staff a little bell. It was just a joke.' The Italian gave his squad bells as a Christmas present to remind them not to slip up in training. Leicester's players look dejected after conceding during Ranieri's last game, a defeat in Seville 'It's fantastic when you see before the match, an old lady with a Leicester shirt outside the stadium. I say: 'Unbelievable. They come from Leicester to support us.' This is my emotion.' Ranieri explains why he shed a tear following Leicester's 2-0 win at Sunderland in April which put them 10 points clear. 'Now we go straight away to try to win the title. We are in the Champions League, dilly ding, dilly dong - come on. We are in the Champions League, it is fantastic, terrific. Well done to everybody. Ranieri finally admits, with four games left, Leicester are going for the title after sealing a Champions League group stage spot.
