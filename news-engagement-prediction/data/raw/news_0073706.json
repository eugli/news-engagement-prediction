Rubio’s opinion comes as several Congressmen have faced major pushback as they held open forums in order to engage constituents during the Congressional recess. \n“They’re instructed to boo no matter what answer I give,” Rubio said about protesters. “They’re instructed to interrupt me if I go too long, and start chanting things, then at the end they’re also told not to give up their microphone when they ask questions.” \nWhen DeFede asked Rubio about town hall attendees with real concerns and political questions, Rubio said those “real people” are “real liberal activists and I respect their right to do it but it’s not a productive exercise.” Rubio went on to say that he has no problem defending his positions, though doing so amid town hall protests is mostly pointless. \n“They are designed to basically heckle and scream at me in front of cameras so that Channel 4 and other networks and other stations at night will report,” Rubio said. \nSome GOP Congressmen have argued that these demonstrations were concocted by paid protesters from outside of their congressional districts, and Rubio’s statement echoes what President Trump had to say about “liberal activists” who were protesting. \nWatch above, via CBS Miami. \n[Image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:28:00.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
