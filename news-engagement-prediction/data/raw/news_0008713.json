The news came on the heels of Uber CEO Travis Kalanick's announcement that he would leave President Trump's economic advisory council. \nShannon Coulter, one of the co-founders of the #GrabYourWallet campaign to boycott Trump family businesses, rejoiced at the news. Big news everyone. You did this. I am in awe. https://t.co/q9vwmyfpbn — Shannon Coulter (@shannoncoulter) February 2, 2017 One customer reached out privately to Nordstrom via Twitter to verify the news and received this response. Daily Dot Some customers have critiqued the store for targeting Ivanka Trump's brand. Nordstrom, however, insists the decision was not political and was based solely on poor sales performance. @JuliaGulia809 We didn't buy the brand for this season based on its sales performance, Julia. This was not a political decision. — Nordstrom (@Nordstrom) February 3, 2017 Some have cited the unusual timing, but Nordstrom has responded that the choice was business as usual. @bendynaa It's not political for us. Our buying decisions are guided by brand performance, based on sales we decided not to buy this season. — Nordstrom (@Nordstrom) February 3, 2017 The company also points out that there has been no public announcement. Rather, it has responded to questions from individual customers as well as the media. @Libertyhound1 We didn't make a formal announcement. We've been responding to questions that we've received including from media sources. \nWhatever the store's motivation for pulling the line, weak sales performance may in itself be an indicator that the boycott tactics are in fact effective. \"Ivanka's low sales may be evidence that the boycott is working.\" https://t.co/lMJbzqifuI — Shannon Coulter (@shannoncoulter) February 3, 2017 Boycotters are continuing to take aim at retailers that still carry Trump products.\nSuch as Macy's. — Monica Parker (@monicacparker) February 3, 2017 T.J.

It's TIME -I miss my weekly visits you miss my $$ #GrabYourWallet — Catherine Cobb Ryan (@ccryannyc) February 3, 2017 And retail giant Amazon. @amazon Don't let @Nordstrom & @neimanmarcus leave you in the dust.
