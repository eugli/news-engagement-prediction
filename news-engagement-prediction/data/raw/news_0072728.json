Maybe... \nHarvey Milk was assassinated in 1978 after becoming the first openly gay person to run and be elected to major public office in the United States. \nHe became a LGBT icon in the 1970s when running for public office as an openly gay man in San Francisco but faced fierce homophobic opposition and received regular death threats. \nOn November 27, 1978, former city Supervisor Dan White snuck into City Hall and killed Milk and Mayor George Moscone, who had supported Milk’s appointment to public office. \nMilk predicted his own assassination and recorded a message he wished to be played out upon his death which said: “If a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door”. Harvey Milk (Getty Images) \nThe jury found Dan White non-guilty of first-degree murder and he was instead convicted of voluntary manslaughter, a verdict which sparked the historic “White Night riots” in San Francisco. \nHarvey Milk’s nephew, and gay rights activist, Stuart Milk, told to the Standard about his uncle’s legacy: “Essentially my uncle was the first openly gay person to run and be elected to major public office in the United States. \n“His election really gave hope to people around the world. When he ran, it was illegal to be gay in the United States, and in California, and it was also considered a medical illness. \n“They were still doing electric shock therapy. But here you had someone who wasn’t just simply saying ‘I’m gay’ but he said: ‘I’m gay and I’m asking other people to come out and I’m not going to hide it, and you need to know who we are and we need to be visible’. \n“His message was that unless we were visible, we would never achieve any success in terms of our equalities. \n“He knew that he was going to be assassinated. He was only in office for 11 months but he knew he was going to be assassinated because he got death threats every single day. \n“In fact, we keep copies of some of these death threats because many of these were not even anonymous – they were signed. \n“He didn’t know who and he didn’t know when but he knew he was going to be killed. Stuart Milk, Harvey's nephew \n“So it wasn’t Sean Penn and it wasn’t Hollywood that came up with that recording, he actually did record that if he is shot, let this message be played: ‘let the bullets that smash through my brain, smash through every closet door’. \n“He was hoping that would be the last violence that would be perpetrated against the LGBT community and that that be a wake-up call that we have to be visible, and that really was – it was a turning point in point in the United States. \n“There was an amazing candle lit vigil that was spontaneous the night that he was killed, where 40,000 San Franciscans came out with candles in silence. Complete silence. 'The night of gay rage' (Getty Images) \n“It was one of the most eloquent responses to violence that any community has ever done. \n“A year later, the person who assassinated my uncle was found not guilty of murder even though he snuck into City Hall. \n“The jury cried – not for my uncle, but for Dan White because he was portrayed as a good Catholic Christian, former policeman, former fireman, who killed a gay person. \n“It was called the night of gay rage. San Francisco lost most of its police cars, City Hall was attacked, people were angry. Harvey Milk (Getty Images) \n“My uncle wouldn’t have wanted violence to have followed in anything that he did but that was another wake-up call that our justice system was just if you looked a certain way, if you behaved a certain way, or if you were of a certain colour. So that also created tremendous change.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:48:37.782+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
