As we find out more details about the swap that sent Cousins to the Pelicans , the common theme continues to be that the Kings really love Buddy Hield . I mean, they really love the guy. Kings owner Vivek Ranadive let Hield know it too. In his 2 games in Sacramento as a member of the Pelicans, Buddy Hield said Kings owner Vivek Ranadive would say: 'we're still gonna get you' — Sean Cunningham (@SeanCunningham) February 23, 2017 “We’re still gonna get you” is absolutely one of the creepiest things I’ve ever heard. I want no boss to say that to me ever, and especially don’t want to hear it on two separate occasions. It’s great for Hield that a team has so much confidence in him moving forward, but it’s hard to have much confidence in the Kings’ front office making the right choice when it comes to personnel. So here’s to hoping Hield somehow salvages this bizarre trade. Just to recap all the weird ways the Kings love Buddy Hield: There were objectively better deals available for the Kings, but since they think so highly of Buddy Hield, that's the direction they went. Hield could be Stephen Curry. Source familiar w/ Kings’ thinking: \"Vivek thinks Buddy [Hield] has Steph Curry potential.” Am told that fixation was a key driver in deal. — Baxter Holmes (@BaxterHolmes) February 20, 2017 And just for fun. — Sam Vecenie (@Sam_Vecenie) February 20, 2017 Next Up In NBA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T10:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:56:47.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
