Trump, meeting with organizations that deal with victims of trafficking, said \"I want to make clear today that my administration will focus on ending the absolutely horrific practice of human trafficking and I am prepared to bring the full force and weight of our government\" to fight what he called a \"horrific problem.\" Trump added \"It's a very, very terrible problem, it's not talked about enough. People don't know enough about it and we're going to talk about it and we're going to bring it out into the open and hopefully we're going to do a great deal to help prevent some of the horrific, really horrific crimes that are taking place.\" Globally, nearly 21 million people are victims of human trafficking, according to the U.N.'s International Labor Organization. An estimated 4.5 million of them are forced into sex work. More cases of human trafficking were reported in California than in any other U.S. state last year, according to data from the National Human Trafficking Resource Center's hotline. Some 5,500 cases of sex trafficking were reported to the center's hotline nationwide last year, according to its website.
