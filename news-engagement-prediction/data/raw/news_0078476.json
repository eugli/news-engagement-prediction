We condemn it and whether it is the ABVP or the another group that is being instigated by so called anti-national elements it`s imperative to sit down debate and discuss and come up with a solution. We don`t spoil the future of our youth,\" Shaina NC said. \nMeanwhile, Kargil martyr’s daughter Gurmehar Kaur, who came under harsh criticism from BJP members and certain sections of the society for her campaign against violence in the name of nationalism, today announced that she is 'withdrawing from the campaign'. \n\"I'm withdrawing from the campaign. Congratulations everyone. I request to be left alone. I said what I had to say,\" she tweeted this morning. \n\"I have been through a lot and this is all my 20 year self could take,\" she added further while venting out her frustation.

Venkaiah Naidu came down heavily on Opposition parties including Congress for slamming the government on Ramjas college incident. \nHe asserted that the government does not support any violent activities.Naidu said the difference opinion is agreeable but not disintegration. \n\"Certain misguided sections are trying to mislead young population, create social tensions and hurt the sentiments of the people.Naidu said freedom of expression cannot be used to advocate separatism,\" Naidu said. \nThe minister alleged that the opposition parties are not able to digest growing popularity of Narendra Modi government. \nLast week, Left-affiliated AISA and the BJP backed ABVP clashed with each other causing injuries to many. The reason of the clash was an invite to JNU students, Umar Khalid, who is facing sedition charge, and Shehla Rashid to address a seminar. \nThe seminar was withdrawn by the college authorities following opposition by the ABVP. A few policemen and journalists were also roughed up during the violence.
