In Vietnam, a modified M2 was used by a U.S. sniper to kill an enemy combatant 2,500 yards away , a record that stood until 2002.\nRelated: The Army’s New State-of-the-Art $580 Million Handgun\nThe military has thousands of M2s, including versions mounted on Humvees, M1 Abrams tanks, Navy ships and Black Hawk helicopters. The ground model costs about $14,000. The machine gun-grenade launcher hybrid would presumably be more expensive.\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times: 6 Dumb Mistakes Trump Has Made -- and 6 Dangerous Ones 5 Attack Planes That Could Replace the A-10 Warthog The 10 Most Expensive Weapons in the Pentagon’s Arsenal\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.scout.com/military/warrior/story/1696176-army-merges-50-cal-grenade-launcher-into-1", "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2017/02/16/6-Dumb-Mistakes-Trump-Has-Made-and-6-Dangerous-Ones", "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2017/01/23/Army-s-New-State-Art-580-Million-Handgun", "http://www.marines.com/operating-forces/equipment/weapons/mark19", "https://warisboring.com/the-mother-of-all-machine-guns-3c6e09ec4a33#.1quq7z5iz", "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/14/5-Attack-Planes-Could-Replace-10-Warthog", "http://www.military.com/equipment/m2-50-caliber-machine-gun", "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Media/Slideshow/2016/03/22/10-Most-Expensive-Weapons-Pentagon-s-Arsenal"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:09:18.778+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
