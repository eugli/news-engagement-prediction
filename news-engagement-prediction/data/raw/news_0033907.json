He brings into clear focus how awesome it is that there are kids in high school who’ve only ever had stuff from 2010-on as a reference point: his 2016 album, Longest Day, Shortest Night , was a late summer treat filled with hoarse, wet raps about K2, borough-wide indictments, and being too broke to go to SUNY Purchase. MIKE’s latest offering (and first foray into making beats) is “years/Alone,” a pair of miniature loosies that strike different tones of the same color. On “years,” a maroon loop of fuzzed-out piano bubbles up under itchy snares, and MIKE scoffs at newfound daps, asking, “Why do you care that I rap?” before laughing to himself. On “Alone,” cherry horns from a cassette bin sample hiss by, and Mike lumbers along with heavy-tongued lines about the 5 and L train. His best lyrics unwrap slowly, like the coda, “We cooking up until we burn the house down/ Every course is like the fucking last round/ I stand up, I don’t fucking back down.” He's dishing solid stuff and we're ready for another plate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:36:52.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
