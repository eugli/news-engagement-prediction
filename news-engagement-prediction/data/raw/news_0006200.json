His Tuesday night nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court triggered well-rehearsed protests but also some unexpected support.\nBoth of Trump's actions were in line with his campaign promises and were executed without the leaks so common in Washington. Both elicited outraged reaction, including some transparently spurious arguments. But Trump seems likely to come out the winner, politically and on substance.\nThe immigration order was widely and inaccurately labeled a \"Muslim ban\" — a policy Trump advocated on the campaign trail, but abandoned many months before he was nominated and elected.\nMany protesters argued that any limit based on nationality or religion is \"un-American.\" But American law has long given preference to those persecuted for their religion. And asserting that discriminating by nationality is verboten is only a short step from the proposition that everyone in the world has a right to move to the United States.\nThat open-borders position is simply wrong as a matter of constitutional and international law. And it's politically untenable.\nInitial polling shows a plurality favoring the order—a better score than Trump's popular vote percentage. Poll results may vary considerably depending on question wording and opinion may change based on events. But it's clear the rage expressed by Trump's critics is not indicative of wider public opinion, just as the giant turnout for the \"women's\" marches Jan. 21 isn't typical of the nation. Analyst Nate Silver estimates that 80 percent of the turnout occurred in states carried by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton . Democrats' \"fight in the streets\" (Sen. Tim Kaine 's phrase) is playing to the base, not the wider public.\nThere's no polling yet on Judge Gorsuch's nomination, but even liberal elites are impressed. Obama administration acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal, writing in the New York Times , warmly endorsed the nominee, his \"sense of fairness and decency,\" his \"temperament that suits the nation's highest court,\" and expressed confidence that he \"would help restore confidence in the law.\"\nDemocratic senators are still smarting over Republicans' refusal last year to even consider Barack Obama 's highly qualified nominee, Judge Merrick Garland. But they overstate their case. A majority of senators clearly indicated their constitutionally authorized refusal to consent to his nomination, and no justice has been nominated and confirmed in a presidential election year since 1940, 77 years ago.\nAlso   Mattis warns North Korea: US will counter nuclear attack North Korean nuclear tests have been regarded with growing alarm by foreign policy leaders.\nBy Joel Gehrke • 02/03/17 5:11 PM After the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last February and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's assertion that the Senate would not confirm an Obama nominee, candidate Trump promised to nominate a justice in the Scalia mold, and presented two lists with 21 possible appointees, including Gorsuch.\nIt's as clear as such things can be that the Supreme Court nomination was critical to his election. The exit poll showed that of those who picked the Supreme Court as a major consideration, 56 percent favored Trump over Hillary Clinton . The issue undoubtedly helped this worldly candidate win the votes of 81 percent of white Evangelicals, a higher percentage than voted for previous Republican nominees.\nWill Democrats try to defeat the Gorsuch nomination as they can, under current Senate rules, with a filibuster? Minority Leader Charles Schumer, listening to the baying crowds beneath his Brooklyn apartment, raises that threat. But at least eight Democratic senators, including three from Hillary Clinton states, have come out for \"a hearing and a vote.\" That's one way to square their protests over Judge Garland's rejection with avoiding negative feedback from trying to stop an obviously superbly qualified nominee.\nIt's also a way to preserve the filibuster for a later nominee. Harry Reid, then the Democratic Majority Leader, set a precedent in 2013 by abolishing the filibuster for lower court and executive branch nominations. It's clear that McConnell would do the same for the Supreme Court , and would be on solid political ground, if Democrats actually do filibuster.\nSolid political ground, despite the fact that Trump's approval rating is far lower than those of other incoming presidents. He won the election despite low favorable ratings (just as many who considered her dishonest voted for Hillary Clinton ), because voters favored what he promised to do. On the poorly-vetted immigration order, as on the well-executed Supreme Court nomination, he's followed through.\nAlso   Ryan: Iran deal not going away, new sanctions 'make a lot of sense' Ryan also called for the new administration to \"rigorously enforce\" the nuclear agreement.\nBy Al Weaver • 02/03/17 5:03 PM Top Story Pelosi loses in 2-1 vote upholding ban of 'cops as pigs' student art The controversial painting was selected as part of a student art competition in Rep.
