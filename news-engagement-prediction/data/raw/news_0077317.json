IS SG SAFE FROM CYBER ATTACKS?   \nDear A.S.S. Editor Advertisement \nOh my goodness! What is this news about MINDEF Internet System breached? Just recently, our dear PM had come out and said quite strongly that we must protect ourselves from online data theft, for this is the new wave of cyber attacks that we should be security conscious about. \nAnd of all the agencies to have their system breached, it is MINDEF? The breach, which happened earlier this month, has resulted in the personal data of 850 national servicemen and employees being stolen. No classified military data were stolen in the breach of the I-net system, MINDEF said. Classified military information is stored on a separate system that is not connected to the Internet and has more stringent security features, it added. Even so, to have data of your employees and national servicemen stolen is not a good way to shout out about your strong defenses. \nIf our very own military defense cannot keep its security data from being breached online, then what hope do we have? The big question now is, is security as tight as it's cracked up to be? MINDEF Internet System so easily breached, what hope does others have then? \nPatrick Koh \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
