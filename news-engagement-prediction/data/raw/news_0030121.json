Khoza said the quest to find a replacemet on a full-time basis for Muhsin Ertugral‚ who quit in early November‚ has been hampered by candidates being contracted elsewhere. Pitso: Only Pirates can go toe to toe with Sundowns \nHe said one particular candidate Pirates have their sights on has current contractual issues. \n\"This afternoon we will be meeting with the technical team to identify the problem‚ because clarly there is a problem‚\" Khoza said. \n\"The candidate we have indentified‚ as promised to make an announcement at the end of January‚ is currently contracted elsewhere. \n\"What I can gurantee is that next week Monday we will be announcing a new coach.\" \nSaturday's 6-0 defeat was a record loss margin for Pirates. It followed SuperSport United thrashing Bucs 6-1 in November to equal the previous record‚ resulting in Ertugral's resignation. \n- TMG Digital/TMG Sport", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T18:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:01:52.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
