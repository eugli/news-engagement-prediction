Ryzen thermals \nWhat will be really interesting is to see how far the 1800X can be pushed using air cooling. \nThe 8-core chip has a base clock of 3.6GHz with a boost to 4GHz, so we can realistically hope for around 4.4GHz with air cooling, depending on the exact cooling solution and, of course, the CPU lottery (there are always slight variances when it comes to overclocking tolerances with processors, and you just have to hope you get lucky). \nAt any rate, 4.4GHz will be plenty enough for some storming performance levels. \nRemember that the 1800X will be going on sale for $499 (about £400, AU$650), which is less than half the price of Intel’s Core i7-6900K. AMD has already claimed that its flagship processor beats the latter in Cinebench R15 multi-threaded, and by a considerable margin: 1,601 to 1,474. \nHence all the excitement regarding AMD’s new chips – it certainly looks like the processor world is about to become a far more competitive environment, which is great news for the average consumer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:47:48.156+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
