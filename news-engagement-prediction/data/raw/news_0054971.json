When they use social media to pass along dubious anecdotes in support of a political position, they contribute to a damaging atmosphere of mistrust and uncertainty. \nExhibit A: The indictment last week of two Texas hunters who fabricated a tale of being shot by a murderous band of \"illegal aliens.\" In reality, they shot each other in what appears to have been a stunning violation of routine gun safety protocol. \nAfter the incident in early January, one of the injured men accepted more than $26,000 in charity money donated to help pay his medical expenses. Yet U.S. Border Patrol officials and Presidio County Sheriff's investigators quickly found evidence that no \"border jumpers\" were involved , and that members of the hunting party had been responsible for each other's injuries. \nTexas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, never shy about passing along dubious tales that support his own political leanings, posted the hunters' account to his Facebook page , adding the comment, \"This is why we need the wall and to secure our borders.\" \nThe item was later deleted, but not before it had been shared by Miller's followers more than 6,500 times, according to The Washington Post . \nLikewise, Gov. Greg Abbott eagerly responded to a claim over the weekend by a Rio Grande Valley woman that her grandfather had been robbed at gunpoint by \"illegals\" in the parking lot of a fried chicken restaurant, which she said showed the need for improved border security. \nAbbott quickly tweeted in response: \"Let him know that Texas is coming to his rescue. We'll work to protect him & put an end to this.\" Let him know that Texas is coming to his rescue. We'll work to protect him & put an end to this. #txlege https://t.co/Xmv6nmSAjo — Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) February 18, 2017 \nWhat the governor did not also tell his 152,000 followers was that law enforcement investigating the holdup has no idea whether illegal immigrants were responsible. \n\"There's nothing in this report that would indicate any other matter than a robbery,\" a spokesman for the McAllen Police Department told KGBT-TV in McAllen . \nPoor Sid Miller (\"bless his heart,\" we're often tempted to add) has actually said he should not be held responsible for assisting in the spread of \"fake news.\" \nAfter a December Texas Tribune investigation found 10 provably false \"news\" tales — mostly from conspiracy-minded or obscure right-wing Internet sites — repeated (and often enthusiastically commented upon) on his Facebook page, Miller said plaintively that it's not his job to make sure the information he passes along is, well, true. \n\"I'm not a news source,\" he complained in a subsequent interview with Austin NPR radio affiliate KUT-FM. \"Y'all are holding me to the same standards as you would a news organization.\" \nWhile it's heartening to know that Miller apparently respects the standards of professional journalists and news organizations, we can't agree that public officials shouldn't be held to an obligation to stick to the facts. \nOpinions must be bolstered by truth, especially when they are expressed by our elected leaders. Otherwise, we're all in the dark. View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:59:07.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
