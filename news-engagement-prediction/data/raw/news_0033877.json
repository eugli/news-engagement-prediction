Credit Suisse ( CSGKF ) lost 2.9 billion Swiss francs ($2.9 billion) in 2015. \nThiam was hired in 2015 and announced a major overhaul and cost cutting program just a few months into his tenure. He wants the bank to focus on wealth management and emerging markets. \nThe bank will cut between 5,500 and 6,500 jobs over the coming year, CFO David Mathers said on a conference call with investors. \nOn Tuesday, Thiam said that 2016 -- the first full year of implementing the new strategy -- was \"challenging and busy 12 months.\" \nThe company said it achieved 1.9 billion Francs ($1.9 billion) in savings in 2016 -- more than 500 million Francs ($500 million) above its target. \nIt also shed more than 7,250 jobs over the course of last year. \nWhile losses were greater than analysts had anticipated, the bank's stock climbed 3% following its earnings statement on Tuesday.
