READ MORE: Famine declared in part of South Sudan's Unity state \nIn South Sudan, over 270,000 children are malnourished and a famine has just been declared in parts of Unity State in the north of the country, where 20,000 children live. \nAid agencies only describe a crisis as a famine when at least 20 percent of the population has access to fewer than 2,100 kilocalories of food a day and acute malnutrition is affecting more than 30 percent of the area's children. \nAnother reason to declare a famine is when there are two hunger-related deaths per 10,000 people, or four child deaths per 10,000 children every day. \nUNICEF director Anthony Lake appealed for quick action. \"We can still save many lives,\" he said. \nUN Security Council ambassadors are due to travel to northern Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger next month to draw international attention to the humanitarian crisis triggered by the conflict with Boko Haram fighters.
