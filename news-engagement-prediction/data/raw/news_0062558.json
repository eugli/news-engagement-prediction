We had no idea what was going on.\nThen we saw a United fan, two rows in front of us, who had been surrounded by a group of Blackburn supporters. They were all shouting at him and threatening him.\nIt was incredibly intimidating. A number of kids, including a six-month-old baby, were right in the middle of it and everyone was screaming at the stewards to get the guy out.\nThe stewards were stood on the edge of the crowd trying to make their way in, but struggling because of all the pushing and shoving. The Blackburn fans were desperate to get hold of the United supporter and there was no doubt what they wanted to do to him.\nEventually the stewards got to him, and dragged him along the row of seats by his neck. As they did, a number of Blackburn fans punched and hit the United fan on the head.\nAs they dragged him away, police appeared and the United fan was escorted out of the stand, with another man. He was lucky in a way, because if the Rovers fans had got hold of him it could have been so much worse.\nIt looked as though one boy, maybe aged about eight or nine, had been with the ejected United fan as he was left on his own, crying. The stewards then took him out, presumably to reunite the two of them.\nIt’s rare to see any violence at Ewood Park, even at games against our biggest rivals, Burnley.\n– Blackburn fan and witness The footage has been handed to Lancashire Police, who are understood to be investigating.\n Sport Manchester United Blackburn Rovers", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:53:32.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
