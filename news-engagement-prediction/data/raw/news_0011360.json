She is very psyched. Because, along with some cyberpunk regalia and flame-tinged swords, it’s Lemieux’s bubbles that make this epic video really, you know, pop. Her bubbles are not normal bubbles—in the clip released via Tidal last week, Lemieux’s creations fill with smoke, burst into flames, and envelope Grimes’ entire body. And Lemieux is not a normal bubble lover—she is a self-proclaimed “bubbleologist” who has studied her unique craft for nearly a decade. \nKnown professionally as Miss T the Bubble Queen, the Ontario-based artist has brought her trademark Bubbleology Show to Canadian TV, festivals, schools, children’s cancer camps, along with plenty of birthdays and weddings. So when Grimes’ team reached out to her a few months ago, she was ready. \nPitchfork: What did you think when you got the offer to do this Grimes video? \nTeena Lemieux: I was honored to demonstrate my art with someone else who appreciated it. Bubbles are special—they’re like smiles. I’m the only one in Canada who does this. There’s no book out there, it’s all practice. I heard Grimes loves bubbles and she saw all these scientific marvels that I do with them—I could do everything she wanted. She was excited to have a bubbleologist in her video. \nWere you nervous on set? \nNot really, but everything relied on the bubbles working—every scene had bubbles in it. Bubbles only last a second, so I had to get this one massive bubble—or millions of floating things—in the right position at the right time. \nThere’s one scene where Grimes sets fire to a bubble in her hand. It looks dangerous. \n[ laughs ] It’s not dangerous at all, you don’t even feel it. It only ignites the gas for a second. \nHow do you make a bubble like that one? \nIt’s top secret! It’s based on my own scientific studies! \nHow did you teach Grimes to work with your bubbles? \nIf you wet your hand you can hold a bubble. That’s it. If your hand is dry, you’ll pop the bubble. Everyone knows that. \nAre your bubbles more durable than normal bubbles? \nMine are totally different—do you want to be a bubbleologist? \nI am curious about it. When I saw your name listed under that title in the credits, I was like, What the hell is a bubbleologist?! \nIt sounds scientific! What are you? \nI’m a writer. \nSo you’re a writerologist! \nHow do you think the bubbles factor into the video conceptually? \nBubbles represent moments, or other worlds, or ideas or thoughts floating around, so you gotta go get ’em, otherwise they’ll float away or pop. So those bubbles were all Grimes’ moments. \nWould you want to do more Grimes videos? \nOf course, I could see bubbles in all of her videos! And I’d like to be onstage during a Grimes concert. Do you think the people who love her music would like to see the bubbles? \nYes, I do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:22:39.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
