Author Jennifer 8. Lee investigated the popular biscuit in her book, The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, and found that the cookies are likely of Japanese origin, but they became associated with Chinese cultures after World War II. \n“When Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps, their bakeries that produced the cookies were shuttered,” Rhodes writes of Lee’s findings. “Chinese entrepreneurs stepped in to fill the void and by the end of the war they were indelibly associated with fortune cookies, whose popularity had spread nationwide.” \nLau tells NBC News in the video above that when he arrived working at the company, his English was best among the group, so he was given the job of writing the cookies’ fortunes. \n“I guess I got the job by default,” he said. \nOver the years, Lau said he wanted his fortune messages to make diners happy, a sentiment he’s passed onto his successor, James Wong. Diners can always take matters into their own hands ― Wonton Food Inc. offers custom fortune cookies that allow customers to write their own fortunes.
