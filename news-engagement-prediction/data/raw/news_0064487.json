Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA businessman 'was acting reasonably to defend himself' when a suspected gangster was killed with his own gun during a fight, a coroner has ruled. \nSecurity worker Stephen “Aki” Akinyemi, 44, was shot in the left temple during the tussle with his friend Arran Coghlan on February 9, 2010. \nThe fight took place in Mr Coghlan’s home, a converted chapel in Alderley Edge , Cheshire, where he had arranged a meeting to try and end a feud between Mr Akinyemi and another man, who cannot be named for legal reasons. \nMr Coghlan, 45, who is 6ft 4in, and the muscular Mr Akinyemi, who was 5ft 10in and had been on the verge of becoming a professional boxer, fought in a small and dark ensuite bathroom, the inquest at London’s Royal Courts of Justice was told. \nMr Akinyemi, who had studied martial arts and been a competitive body builder, was wearing body armour under his clothes, but Mr Coghlan would not have had time to be aware of this as they grappled, Coroner Bernard Richmond QC said. \nAt the end of the inquest on Thursday, the coroner rejected short form conclusions of misadventure, lawful or unlawful killing or accidental death to deliver a narrative conclusion. Stephen 'Aki' Akinyemi \nHe told the court: “Stephen Akinyemi, in an attempt to coerce a third party into a course of action, produced a gun to reinforce his demand. \n“During the struggle for control of the gun, in which the third party was acting reasonably to defend himself, the gun - which was at all times held by Mr Akinyemi and whose finger was on the trigger, was discharged four times. \n“One of those discharges caused a bullet to go into Stephen Akinyemi’s head, fatally wounding him.” \nMr Coghlan told a previous inquest in October 2011 that Mr Akinyemi pulled a gun on him and it went off during a struggle in which he got stabbed several times. \nCheshire Coroner Nicholas Rheinberg recorded an open verdict, saying he had 'difficulty' accepting Mr Coghlan’s version of events. The Alderley edge home of Arran Coghlan \nBut following an application by Mr Coghlan for judicial review to the High Court in February 2012, that inquest was quashed and a fresh one was ordered with a different coroner. \nMr Coghlan was initially accused of murdering Mr Akinyemi. \nBut the Crown Prosecution Service dropped the charge because it could not prove Mr Coghlan, who suffered stab wounds to his arms and neck, was not acting in self-defence. \nDelivering his conclusion at the end of the second inquest, Mr Richmond said he was satisfied that Mr Akinyemi and Mr Coghlan, who had known each other since the 1990s, had been on good terms when the fatal fight occurred.

Arran Coghlan \nHe had texted him saying 'Don’t pick up' before calling him, and pretended he had not got through when the man answered the phone, the inquest heard. \nMr Richmond said that Mr Coghlan’s conduct had been 'necessary and reasonable' in response to a sequence of events that unfolded 'unexpectedly and very quickly' seven years ago. \nHe also found that the businessman was someone who valued his friends and was loyal to them. \nMr Akinyemi could be violent and a bully, and had a propensity to carry knives, the coroner said, but was also a “lovely and much-loved” family man.
