He makes massive cash withdrawals. \nAffairs aren't cheap, and credit and debit card transactions, which show up on your statement, are basically a huge, flashing sign saying, \"I am a love rat.\" \nA cheater's way around this, according to JeanMarie, is to use cash only. \nThat way, there are no damning mentions of fancy restaurants and lingerie shops to explain to your other half. JeanMarie also suggests ways of testing your partner - if you feel up to it (Photo: Getty) 2. He loses interest in sex. \nIf your partner seems to have lost interest and enthusiasm in this area, JeanMarie has a blunt warning. \n\"He's getting it elsewhere.\" \nHow you can find out, is by kissing them, apparently. \nOther advice includes, \"Give him a massage, make his favourite meal and see if those actions make any change. \n\"If he has sex with you, then theres still hope. If not, he might not be attracted to you anymore.\" \nThough, in fairness, you might not feel like making the effort - or rewarding his behaviour. The sex has stopped - is he cheating? (Photo: Getty) 3. He checks his phone a lot. \nIt's not just the phone checking which should trigger alarm bells - but if he's secretive with it too. \nSuddenly putting a lock on his phone or pass code, and hiding the screen from you when he uses it are indicative of someone who's playing away. Especially if this behaviour is a new thing. \nIf you want to go one further, JeanMarie says: \n\"My favourite thing to do is search the computer history and see what he’s been looking at. \n\"Another method I tend to enjoy is making a profile on Instagram or Facebook, pretending to be that person, and see if he replies or tries to make plans. \n\"Make sure the girl’s photo is really hot,\" she adds. \nBut also bear in mind, \"it's best to ask a girlfriend so you have her permission to use her intellectual property and photos).\" Watch out for what he does on his phone (Photo: Getty) 4. He makes changes to his appearance. \nOf course, it's entirely possible your partner may just feel like having a bit of re-vamp. \nJeanMarie, on the other hand, warns it could be cause for concern. \n\"Men are simple,\" she explains. \"Once they feel they 'have you,' they will stop impressing you and start impressing someone else.\" Is he dressing to impress...someone else? (Photo: Getty) 5. He suddenly needs to work all the time. \nThis is an oldie but a goodie. \nWork trips and late nights in the office are such a popular foil for cheaters, they've achieved cliché status. \nHowever JeanMarie asserts that any changes to his usual work routine could very well be a sign he's being unfaithful. Working late should act like a red flag (unless they are just really busy and have a very stressful, demanding job) (Photo: Getty) Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T15:49:21.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
