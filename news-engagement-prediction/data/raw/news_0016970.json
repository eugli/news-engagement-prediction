Although, arguably, many of these foibles apply equally to the more experienced skiers and snowboarders among us. \nThe film catalogues typical clangers you might see from Brits in French ski resorts , from being obsessed with ticking off every black run to overdoing it at après time. \nIt got us thinking about the most annoying things that British skiers and snowboarders do in the mountains – and once we started, it was hard to stop. Here's our round-up of 15 of the worst offences. 1. Forming a human wall \nHuge groups of Brits congregating all the way across the piste instead of stopping at the side. Usually on a roller. An accident waiting to happen. 2. Making a huge scene trying to work a GoPro \nYou can spot these a mile off – and can't help but wonder what they're actually filming half the time... What's so fascinating about your mate making a few tortuous turns down a blue run? 3. Men chivvying their partners \nOverheard on the slopes of St Anton this year on Sunday morning at 9am: “Oh, come along Fi. I’m not going to have to wait for you all week am I?” They’d probably been on the slopes for precisely half an hour. Poor Fi. \nEqually, guys trying to teach their long-suffering girlfriends how to ski . Look, if they need lessons, they should be in ski school. If they don't, they probably don't appreciate a patronising tone and unhelpful, unasked for \"tips\". \n• Rant: Stop pretending you're a ski instructor 4. Onesies \n“Has anyone seen the kiddie dressed as a panda, he was with a tiger and a leopard when we last saw him?” So said the sopping wet, six-foot tall zebra in the midst of a blizzard. Arguably his friends should be easy to spot in a whiteout, but adults dressed in “ironic” animal onesies en masse is just, let’s whisper it, sad . Not to mention totally impractical. Wearing onesies is not as cool as you think it is, guys Credit: getty images 5. Shouting loudly and slowly in English \nThis is typical bad behaviour of Brits abroad in any case, but in ski resorts it's particularly galling considering that much of the time the waiter/bartender/lift attendant in question will speak near perfect English – you're just giving them (and everyone else) a headache. 6. Boy (and girl) racers \nOverheard from a guy in his twenties, after he'd collided with a child who'd been below him on the slope: \"She cut me up! She shouldn't have been skiing slowly across the piste like that!\" 7. Exaggerating skiing ability \n\"I'd say I'm advanced.\" Translation: \"I can ski a black – as long as it's not too steep, is impeccably groomed, is fairly wide, it's a clear day, there's no ice, there are no moguls, and there are no other people on the piste.\" \n\"Yeah, I do some off piste.\" Translation: \"I will occasionally ski round the other side of the piste marker, before immediately returning to the run.\" things no one tells you about doing a ski season 8. Exaggerating skiing ability (part two) \nOverestimating ability in the equipment hire shop and getting inappropriate skis and boots that are set up wrongly. Then complaining that the bindings don't come off on the sixth fall of the morning. Then blaming the skis for said falls. Then dragging everyone back to the hire shop to change both skis and boots. 9. Waiting for each other in lift queues \nYou will survive if you sit on different chairlifts. Don't hold the queue up by letting chairs go up half empty. 10. Lack of spatial awareness \nStanding five yards in front of the exit to a lift, getting out a piste map, and ignoring the pile-up behind seems to be a particularly British trait. 11. Asking for steak well done… \n…especially in France. Just no. Britons can sometimes overdo it come après time 12. Skiing drunk \nNo one gets hammered quite like the British. It's never a particularly charming quality – but when you do it on the slopes, you could severely injure someone. 13. Sending someone to bag a restaurant table… \n…And then not turning up for an hour. 14. Stupid hats \nGrown adults wearing spongy spikes and fleecy dreadlocks or \"fun\" helmet covers with ears and tails. Wrong, wrong, wrong! 15. Stag dos \nWell, the ones where the groom is dressed as genitalia. No one, but no one, wants to see a six-foot phallus obscuring the view of a beautiful mountain valley.
