He claimed that Hillary Clinton had somehow gifted to Russia an astonishing 20 percent of the United States uranium supply. \nUranium is the fissionable material used in some types of nuclear weapons , as well as in nuclear power reactors. \nIf true, the claim — made by Trump repeatedly during his presidential campaign — would appear to paint the former secretary of state and Democratic presidential nominee in a worse light with regard to Russia than anything Trump himslef has been accused of. \nHowever, the claim is false. \nHere’s what Trump said on Thursday morning . \n“We had Hillary Clinton try to do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? It’s this thing called nuclear weapons. And other things. Like lots of things are done with uranium. Including some bad things,” Trump said. \n“But nobody talks about that. I did not do anything for Russia. I’ve done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 pecent of our uranium,” he continued. “Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember with the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks?” \nTrumps’ reference to a “plastic button” recalled a 2009 incident in which Clinton, then Secretary of State, presented Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov with a red plastic button with the printed word “reset.” The attempt at a lighthearted gesture reflected President Barack Obama’s belief that newly elected Russian President Dmitry Medvedev represented an opportunity to “reset” soured U.S.-Russia relations while Putin served as prime minister, a theoretically lower-ranking position.

Bannon — who now serves as a top White House counselor to Trump, and guided Trump’s presidential campaign as CEO. \nThe facts that gave rise to the false claim restated by Trump on Thursday involve the 2013 sale of a Toronto, Canada, uranium mining company, Uranium One Inc., to the Russian state-run nuclear energy company Rosatom. \nBy purchasing the mining company, Russia came to effectively control 20 percent of the U.S. capacity to produce uranium — uranium that has not been mined yet and may never be mined. Even more importantly, Russia has no license to import uranium from the United States. In other words, none of the uranium mined by the Toronto company may be legally sent to Russia — unless the current administration or a future one changes course and issues the necessary license.
