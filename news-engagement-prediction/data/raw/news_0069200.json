(AFP) 'Ali! Ali!' - The Greatest makes his final journey \nWashington – A son of boxing legend Muhammad Ali was held for questioning for two hours at a Florida airport upon returning from Jamaica because of his Arabic-sounding name, US media reported late on Friday. \nMuhammad Ali Jr, 44, who was born in Philadelphia and has a US passport, was travelling with his mother Khalilah Camacho-Ali, the late sports icon's second wife, friend and lawyer Chris Mancini told the Louisville Courier-Journal. \nMancini told the newspaper that both were held for questioning at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport on February 7 because of their Arabic-sounding names. \nCamacho-Ali however was released after she showed US Customs agents a photo of herself with her ex-husband. \nAli Jr however, had no such photo – and according to Mancini was held for nearly two hours and repeatedly asked \"Where did you get your name from?\" and \"Are you Muslim?\" \nWhen he said that he, like his father, was a Muslim, the agents asked further probing questions. \nTrump’s Muslim travel ban \n\"To the Ali family, it's crystal clear that this is directly linked to Mr Trump's efforts to ban Muslims from the United States,\" Mancini told the Courier-Journal, a reference to President Donald Trump's late January executive order imposing a 90-day entry ban for citizens of seven Muslim majority countries. \nThe travel ban has since been halted by a US federal court. \nMancini said that he and the Ali family are trying to find out how many other people were stopped for similar questioning, and are considering a federal lawsuit. \nAirport and Customs officials did not answer queries from the newspaper about the case. \nMuhammad Ali, one of the iconic 20th century sports heroes, died after a long battle with Parkinson's disease on June 3. He was 74. \nAli was celebrated as much for his three World Heavyweight titles as for his civil rights battles outside the ring. \nIn 1964, Ali dropped his birth name of Cassius Clay when he converted to Islam. \nHailing from Louisville, Kentucky, Ali was married four times and he was survived by seven daughters and two sons.
