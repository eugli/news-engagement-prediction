Source: Perform O'Keefe bags 12 as Aussies demolish India \nWith a resounding 333-run victory in Pune, the Aussies made a mockery of the former Test spinner's pre-series prediction of an Indian whitewash. \n\"I have played against some of the best Australian sides. In my opinion, looking at the composition, this is the weakest Australian side to tour India,\" Harbhajan told PTI last week. Harbhajan in 2010. Image: Getty \n\"I don't think this team has the wherewithal to cope with a quality Indian side in the Indian conditions. \n\"It can again be 4-0 like 2013 season.\" \nHarbhajan also took aim at Steve Smith and fast bowler Mitchell Starc. \n\"Most of Smith's centuries are against spinners on Australian pitches,\" Harbhajan said. \n\"The length varies, there's less turn and the bounce makes it easier for strokeplayers. In India, Ashwin and Jadeja on these tracks will pose far bigger challenge for Smith. Close Steve Smith's incredible century on Day Three UP NEXT VIDEO Steve Smith's incredible century on Day Three.

Also how many overs will Starc bowl in an innings? 20 overs. So how much his body will hold during the third or fourth spell will be key.\" \nBut instead of praising the tourists, Harbhajan laid blame on the Pune pitch after Steve O'Keefe set up Australia's victory with a record 12 wickets. \nHe took to Twitter after India could only muster 105 and 107 to lose inside three days: Take a bow @stevesmith49 that's an outstanding inn on that pitch actually no pitch..where it looks difficult to play every ball..IndvsAus — Harbhajan Turbanator (@harbhajan_singh) February 25, 2017 Credit to @CricketAus 4 playing unbelievable well on tht wicket.let's hope we play on good tracks frm here onwards nd get th right results — Harbhajan Turbanator (@harbhajan_singh) February 25, 2017 \nFormer India cricket captain Sourav Ganguly also predicted a series whitewash for India. \n\"It will be very difficult for Australia,\" Ganguly told reporters at Mumbai. \n\"I predicted before the England series that it would be 5-0. It became 4-0. Australia will go the 4-0 way against India. \n\"I will be very surprised if India don't win 4-0.\" O'Keefe was huge. Image: Twitter \nAustralian captain Steve Smith said he believed the wicket played into the tourists' hands. \n\"It was certainly a wicket that would more likely suit the India players,\" Smith said after play. \n\"I think it evened up the contest a lot more. We saw the way our spinners bowled on that, they were able to generate good spin and good natural variations. \n\"It was up to them to prepare a wicket and they prepared a wicket that played into our hands. \n\"It will be interesting to see how they prepare in Bangalore.\" Close ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T08:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:23:44.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
