Share your videos at the bottom of the article \nThe name Shrove Tuesday comes from 'shrive', meaning absolution for sins by doing penance. \nThe day gets its name from the tradition of Christians trying to be 'shriven' before Lent.

It's still rung today. \nIn the US it's called Mardi Gras aka 'Fat Tuesday' in French mainly because we use up the fatty foods before Lent. \nPancake Day itself came much later as a way of using up rich foods, like eggs, milk and sugar before the 40 days of fasting - Lent .

Eggs for creation, flour sustenance or the staff of life, salt for wholesomeness and milk for purity.
