Share Everything you need to know about tonight's lunar eclipse Independent.ie Stargazers in Ireland will be treated to a partial eclipse tonight. http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-tonights-lunar-eclipse-35441381.html \nFebruary's full moon will grow a little darker and appear as a deep red. \nThe eclipse will begin at 10.32pm and peak at 12.34am. \nThe phenomenon appears when the sun, Earth and moon are aligned with the earth in the middle. The moon's surface will shine because it is reflecting the sun's rays. \nThe spectacle should be visible across Ireland, as well as most of North and South America, Europe, Africa and most of Asia. \nAlthough less spectacular than a total lunar eclipse, or a Blood Moon, people nationwide should be able to get a good glimpse with Met Eireann forecasting a clear, cold night. \nThe penumbral eclipse is often mistaken for a normal Full Moon but, according to Astronomy Ireland, the next total lunar eclipse will be visible from Ireland on January 21st, 2019. \nThose lucky enough to own binoculars or a telescope can also keep an eye out for the New Year comet, which will also be visible in our skies tonight. \nThe comet will be 7.4 million miles away, the closest it's been to Ireland since 2011. \nTemperatures are set to drop to below minus three degrees tonight with severe frost and icy patches. \nBrace yourself for the weekend, as Saturday will be very cold with highest temperatures of four to six degrees. \nThere will be coastal showers with the possibility of hail storms. \nSunday will again be cold with coastal showers and temperatures between four and six degrees.
