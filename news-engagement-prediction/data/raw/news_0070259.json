Susan Collins of Maine is calling for former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn to testify before the Senate Committee on Intelligence in the wake of Flynn stepping down from his role earlier this month.\nFlynn resigned after it was revealed he misled Vice President Mike Pence about a call that took place with the Russian ambassador pertaining to sanctions.\n“All of us are determined to get the answers, to say, ‘Yes, I’m confident,'” she told Maine Public Wednesday. “I am going to request, and many of the members will, that we call Mike Flynn to come testify, the former national security adviser to come testify before us.”\nCollins assured voters that the Senate Intelligence Committee was conducting a broad investigation into Russia’s interference in the U.S. election and expects they will conduct public hearings in addition to the private hearings being held. A comprehensive report is also anticipated.\n“We’re not going to exclude anyone from our review and it will be thorough, accurate, bipartisan and in-depth,” she continued.\nCollins said they have not ruled out the possibility of subpoenaing President Donald Trump’s tax returns if the committee feels it’s necessary to the investigation.\n“I don’t know whether we will need to do that, if it’s necessary to get to the answers, then I suspect that we would. The initial decision would be made by the chairman and the vice chairman,” she said. “My hope is that we’ll have a lot of voluntary cooperation, and keep in mind that in some ways this is a counterintelligence operation, in many ways, and that’s what our committee specializes in.”\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter \nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
