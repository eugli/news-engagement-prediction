The PPUTRC involves the states of Alaska, Oregon and Mississippi, as well as Iceland, and is one of six official Federal Aviation Administration test sites in the U.S. \n“We are pleased to have Ted Ralston onboard to develop, test and evaluate UAS technology to determine standards for safe and reliable integration into both Hawai‘i and our nation’s airspace,” said Margo Edwards, interim executive director of ARL/UH. “His experience and knowledge in the aerospace industry is a perfect fit to conduct UAS operational tests in Hawai‘i’s unique and challenging environment involving heat, humidity, high winds and rugged terrain.” \nRalston currently serves as a part-time advisor to the National Disaster Preparedness Training Center in Honolulu and was a major content contributor to a FEMA course on UAS use in disaster management. Over a 42-year career in aerospace, Ralston has held various management and director positions with the Boeing Company and McDonnell-Douglas Corporation and previously served in various engineering and project management positions with Pratt & Whitney’s Aircraft Division. He received his bachelor’s degree in aeronautical and astronautical engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1968 and completed his master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1971. Ralston is a 1963 graduate of Punahou School. \n“It’s exciting to see new aerospace-oriented technology advancing in Hawai‘i,” said DBEDT Director Luis P. Salaveria. “As we move our innovation economy forward, testing and developing this type of technology is ideally suited to help expand and diversify future business development opportunities statewide.” \n\nAbout ARL/UH \nThe Applied Research Lab at the   was established in July 2008 as a Navy sponsored laboratory to provide research, development, test and evaluation, system engineering and other engineering capabilities essential to the Navy and the Department of Defense. It is one of 13 University Affiliated Research Centers (UARC) within the Department of Defense and the fifth of five centers contracted with the Navy. \nThe contract with the Navy is a sole-source mechanism that the Navy and other government agencies can use to fund ARL researchers at UH in approved research areas.
