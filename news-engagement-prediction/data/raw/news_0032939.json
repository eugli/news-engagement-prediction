It's a very long flight, without water too.\" External Link: Roses from Kenya \nKenya is one of the world's biggest exporters of roses, and according to the Kenya Flower Council (KFC), the nation's floriculture industry earned Kenya shillings 62.9 billion ($AU792million) in 2015. \nThe Council's website said flower farms in Kenya employ more than 100,000 people and are on track to expand greatly over the next five years. \nEarlier this year, Kenya Airways Cargo (KQ Cargo) entered into an agreement with QANTAS to export flowers to Australia. \nIn its press statement, KQ Cargo said it was aiming to freight over 30 tonnes of flowers into Australia every month. \nKQ Cargo sales manager Patricia Odida said Kenya Airways' relationship with the Australian airline had enabled the success of the new service to uplift flowers via Johannesburg into Sydney and Melbourne. \n\"This is a major game changer for Kenya in terms of increasing trade exports of flowers to non-traditional markets,\" Ms Odida said. \n\"This partnership opens up the Australian market for exporters and is a business opportunity for us to generate revenue.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T09:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:42:55.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
