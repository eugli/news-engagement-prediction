Here's why: Toni Erdmann is by nature a lovable prankster whose sense of humour shines through above all else. Essentially — his personality mirrors that of Jack Nicholson. The visual similarities are quite frankly, uncanny (see above). While Toni Erdmann is a joker, he also has a heart of gold and is desperate to connect with his corporate daughter, similarly, for all his roguishness, Jack has a good heart beneath the layers of prankster behavior.

However, beneath the cold, corporate exterior lies a hidden sense of humor which makes a rather dramatic appearance in the movie — something which Kristen will absolutely excel at. Like Sandra Hüller who plays Ines, Wiig is a recognizable name, but she's not a super A-list star, which allows her to play more fringe, exciting roles such as Toni Erdmann's daughter. Poll Will you go to see the American remake of Toni Erdmann? Yes, the cast looks amazing! Erm, no. I am able to read subtitles so will stick with the original thanks. \n(Poll Image: NFP Marketing & Distribution) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:36:10.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
