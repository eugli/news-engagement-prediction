Low barramundi catches in recent years \nWith dry weather in recent years, barramundi catches have been down, and last year fishermen returned to port early because it was not worth fishing. \nMr Lane said he had to cut down on costs to pull through the past years. \n\"We've been down on catch quite significantly compared to the rain periods,\" he said. \n\"But we've managed to survive by just cutting costs and doing things like that.\" \nJames Cook University professor Dean Jerry said long periods of dry weather restricted barramundi habitats. \n\"Often if you've had a couple of years of dry spell, there hasn't been the opportunity for the interconnection of waterholes and lagoons which may house barramundi,\" he said. Big wet in the west External Link: Fitzroy River flowing \nCommercial barramundi fisherman Mark Douglas, who is based out of Wyndham in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, said his fishing grounds had experienced one of the biggest wet seasons on record, which would make for a great 2017 on the water. \n\"We've had some significant rain over the last two months which is breaking records all around the Kimberley, so it's looking like being a good season,\" he said. \n\"The last few years have been a bit of a drought on land, which is a drought at sea, so I'm expecting a cracker season.\" \nMr Douglas said orders from customers were flooding in and he was keen to get out on the water as soon as possible. \n\"I haven't seen so many prawns in the waterways like this for at least five years,\" he said. \n\"Prawns usually equals plenty of fish, and there's salmon everywhere at the moment, so everyone should be getting into it.\" Restocking waterways on east coast to increase catch \nOn the eastern seaboard, commercial and recreational fisherman have taken to restocking their waterways with barramundi fingerlings to increase their catch. \nTerry McGeachin, from the Townsville Barramundi Stocking Society, said the society relied on a great deal of help from the local council. \n\"I think they see the benefit in doing it. It's a fishery, it keeps local industry going and I think the place needs all we can get,\" Mr McGeachin said. \nThe restocking program also received a boost from a group of commercial net fisherman and seafood retailers who donated $1,500 to the society to put into barramundi fingerlings.

(ABC) \nCommercial fisherman Nathan Rynn said the money had been donated to take some pressure off Mother Nature to spawn new barramundi fingerlings. \n\"We've had four consecutive dry years up here. This is just going to take a bit of pressure off Mother Nature in producing barramundi for us,\" Mr Rynn said. \nHe said it was important that commercial and recreational fishermen gave back to the barramundi stocks. \n\"It does show a lot of unity among all sectors and uses a resource here in Townsville which important,\" he said. \n\"We all take from the resource so it's important, especially from a commercial point of view, that we put fish back into the water.\" Best catches could take time \nProfessor Jerry said barramundi catches normally peaked about two years after a big wet season. \n\"Basically because it takes about that amount of time for the barramundi to become legal size to catch both commercially and recreational,\" he said. \nHowever, he said there could be some handy catches for fishermen early in the season this year. \n\"A big wet opens up and interconnects those habitats and allows those barramundi which may be a couple of years in age to move down into the main river systems,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:47:18.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
