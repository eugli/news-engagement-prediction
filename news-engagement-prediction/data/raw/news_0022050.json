Conrad for The New York Times The archdiocesan spokesman, Joe Zwilling, said that the archdiocese would “probably” sell the property at some point, perhaps when the real estate market picks up. But Ms. Bowman said there was a stipulation in its deed: It must be maintained and cannot be sold. “And if for any reason they want to get rid of it, they have to give it back to us,” she said. Mr. Zwilling said, however, “There is nothing in the contract or any addendum that says that the house can’t be sold.” Ms. Bowman said that Cardinal Dolan had continued to assure her over the past year that the house was being used as she intended. “I’m in touch quite a lot with the cardinal,” she said. “And he always says, ‘We are so grateful for the gift; it’s wonderful.’ And there has never been any hint that they are going to sell it.” The cardinal spent about five days between Christmas and New Year’s and an August vacation at the house. He has also “been joined by priests and seminarians there,” Mr. Zwilling said. Mr. Zwilling said he was not sure if priests had gone there when the cardinal was not present, but he added: “It’s not his house. Yes, he has been there a couple of times, but he wants other people to be able to use it as well.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In 2016, the archdiocese registered the house with the Town of Ramapo as a clergy residence, exempting it from its annual tax bill of approximately $90,000. Mr. Zwilling said the original idea was that it would replace Trinity Retreat House in Larchmont, N.Y., a more spartan residence with space for 14 priests that is not “in the best physical condition.” Photo Cardinal Cooke Catholic Center, the archdiocese’s headquarters, on 1011 First Avenue in New York.

On Monday, the archdiocese announced further cuts, saying it will close six schools at the end of the school year because of enrollment and money problems. The schools are Saint Gregory the Great in Manhattan; Saints Peter and Paul, Saint Ann, Visitation and Saint Mary in the Bronx; and Saint Peter’s Regional in Sullivan County. The archdiocese closed 30 schools in 2011 and 25 schools in 2013. The archdiocese has been having trouble raising money from parishioners because of an “overarching problem of mistrust and antagonism toward the archdiocese,” Cardinal Dolan wrote in a biting letter to priests in November. “Why are we afraid to urge our people to sacrificial generosity?” he wrote in that letter, first published in January by The National Catholic Reporter . “The Evangelicals sure demand stewardship!
