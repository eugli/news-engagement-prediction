The idea was to help the participants relax and raise money for the Small Animal Rescue Society of B.C. The bunnies roamed free on the yoga mats as participants went through poses during hour-long classes. Participants were allowed to pet or hold the bunnies during the class.\nThe yoga bunnies are available for adoption, but it’s unclear how they’re handling the Downward Dog poses in the meantime.\n \nBunny yoga is about to start! Another session coming up at 11am in the VIP room.\nPosted by SFU Recreation on  Monday, February 27, 2017 Simon Fraser University isn’t the first place to host a bunny yoga class.
