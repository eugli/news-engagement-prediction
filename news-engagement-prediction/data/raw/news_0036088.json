Advertisement \nHe said the panel had found the greyhound industry can continue to operate in NSW provided its recommendations are adhered to. \nThe changes would ensure that \"in essence NSW becomes best practice for greyhound racing and for animal welfare when it comes to the greyhound racing industry\". \nRacing minister Paul Toole said the government would respond to the report's 122 recommendations in due course. \nThe panel report was commissioned last year by then premier Mike Baird after he backed down on an initial push to close down the industry after concerted industry and media pressure. \nThe proposed new three-commissioner Greyhound Welfare and Integrity Commission would act as regulator and operate independent of government. \nIt would have \"a broad range of investigative powers\" to enter and search public and private premises and use in prosecutions evidence gathered by covert surveillance authorised by a court warrant. \nThe panel says Greyhound Racing NSW should be stripped of regulatory functions and oversee the sport's commercial operations. \nThe regime would introduce \"strict controls on euthanasia\" and restrictions on small animals such as rabbits and possums that could be used as lures being kept where greyhounds are raced or kept. \nThe chief executive of the NSW Greyhound Industry Racing Alliance, Brenton Scott, highlighted a recommendation that the industry should receive a greater share of TAB racing turnover under the inter-code agreement. \nBut the NSW Greens rejected the panel's report as \"just a political compromise\". \n\"There is no way any regulator can reform an industry so rotten to the core,\" said Greens MLC Mehreen Faruqi.
