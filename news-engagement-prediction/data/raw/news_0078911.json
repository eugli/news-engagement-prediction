It is a delight to be able to share with others his great generosity.\" \nThese random acts of kindness which also include volunteer work in a homeless shelter, a £25,000 donation to a stranger who was in debt, and millions of pounds of donations to Childline, did not come as a surprise to Mr Edmonds who hailed Michael \"one of the most generous people to ever walk the planet\". George Michael fans were left heartbroken following the star's death last Christmas Niklas Halle'n/AFP \nAppearing to imply that there could be other tales, the 68-year-old urged those lucky recipients to \"respect\" Michael's wish for confidentiality following his death last Christmas. \nSpeaking exclusively to IBTimes UK , he said: The fact that George was a massive fan of the show is not a secret. Likewise, the fact that he was one of the most generous people to ever walk the planet is indisputable. \n\"In life, he conducted many acts of extraordinary kindness without seeking any public acknowledgement. Even though he has departed I personally feel his wish for confidentiality should still be respected,\" said Edmonds.
