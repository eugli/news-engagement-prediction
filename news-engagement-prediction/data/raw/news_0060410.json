Korean community fed up with attention In the spotlight: S. Korean owners of outlets like the ones in Desa Sri Hartamas say the assassination of Jong-nam has got nothing do them. They just want to go about their business as usual. \nKUALA LUMPUR: While the country, if not the world, is gripped by the unfolding saga of Kim Jong-nam’s murder, some among the South Korean community here are groaning about the unwanted attention on them. \nSince the North Korean’s death last Monday, business operators of the South Korean enclave of the upscale Solaris Mont Kiara have found themselves under the glare of the foreign media. \n“Leave us alone. This has nothing to do with us,” said one irate restaurant owner when approached. \nHis reaction reflected the general feeling of his counterparts, although business went on as usual. \nAt around noon yesterday, many of the Korean restaurants and hair salons were doing brisk business. \nAsked about the highest-profile killing on Malaysian soil involving a relative of the top leader of their country’s hostile neighbour, most of the business owners said they were fed up with the media attention and declined to comment. \nThe manager of a South Korean mini-mart said members of the foreign press, including their compatriots and the Japanese, had visited the area to get feedback but were turned away. \nA restaurant owner, Shim, 35, said Jong-nam’s death had no impact among the South Korean community here. \n“Most of the people around my age are too busy working and do not talk about it,” he said. \nBut he admitted that the incident was a hot topic among his parents’ peers back home. \nShim added that his business had not been adversely affected following the assassination and the subsequent diplomatic fallout as most of his customers were locals. \nFormer president of the Korean Association in Malaysia Datuk Bryce Kwon said the South Korean community was not worried about a possible backlash from the murder. \n“The police are conducting their investigation so we will leave it to them. So far, none of the residents here have expressed concern about the situation nor have businesses been affected. \n“We feel safe in Malaysia. There is nothing for us to worry about,” he said when contacted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:58:38.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
