(Uncredited/AP) \nThe New Horizons mission has broadcast stunning pictures of the would-be planet back to Earth, but a proposal to the IAU says “many members of the public, in our experience, assume that alleged ‘non-planets’ cease to be interesting enough to warrant scientific exploration.” \nScientists such as New Horizons leaders Kirby Runyon and Alan Stern say the term “planets” should roughly mean “round objects in space that are smaller than stars.” \nThe new definition would simplify the one thought up in 2006, which disqualified Pluto based on its size and the fact that it is not alone in its orbit, but enmeshed in the Kuiper Belt at the edge of the solar system. Alan Stern, principal investigator of NASA's New Horizons mission team, believes Pluto should be called a planet. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) \nHowever, the recent proposal would not just save Pluto from its current state of embarrassment, but create an entire new crop of non-asteroid “planets” including the Moon. \nSpaceX postpones rocket launch with just 13 seconds to spare \nRunyon and Stern’s paper says there would be at least 110 planets in the solar system, including the Moon, the moons of planets such as Jupiter and “dwarf planets” such as Ceres and Eris. \nUnder the new proposal, teachers would not require their students to learn all of the planets, but pick a small number, such as nine, to have pupils memorize.
