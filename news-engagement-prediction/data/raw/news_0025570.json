Naming the spider after a new friend \nDr Baehr named the pollardi species after Queensland microbiologist and Griffith University Associate Professor Peter Pollard. \nThe two crossed paths when she was trying to sell her vintage bike.

(ABC Radio Brisbane: Jessica Hinchliffe) \n\"I put it on Gumtree and a day later I met Peter Pollard,\" Dr Baehr said. \n\"I did some research on him and discovered he was a microbiologist and he had changed how we thought about the waterways here in Queensland, so I thought he was a great match. \n\"I wanted to name a species after someone who had done great things for Queensland as I wanted to honour them.\" The next best thing to being named Australian of the Year \nAssociate Professor Pollard said he was \"flabbergasted\" when Dr Baehr asked if she could name a spider after him. \n\"You can only have one Australian of the Year, but to me this is the best next thing,\" he said. \n\"I'm a water person and I had spent my whole life studying virus and algae in water, so the fact that this spider is only found on Lord Howe works. \n\"Being honoured with a named species of spider was amazing.\" \nHe said the description of his career written by Dr Baehr that sits within the research paper was touching. \n\"The way Barbara wrote the etymology that goes with the species name was such a beautiful summary of what I had spent my life doing. \n\"I hope it starts a life-long friendship.\" Giving science a human touch \nThe spider was one of eight new species discovered by Dr Baehr during her research. \nShe said they demonstrated the diversity Australia held. \n\"Australia has half a million species of animals and 70 per cent of them are not described or known,\" she said. \n\"I'm a bit of a spider woman and I see this as my contribution to the knowledge to the country's wild state.\" \nShe said she hoped more scientists would look at highlighting achievements of others when naming new species.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:57:46.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
