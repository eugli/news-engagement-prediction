But Ashley Hardacre, from Michigan, US, found herself scared late one evening after an apparent ploy to lure her out of her vehicle. \nAshley, 19, works at a retail store at her local Genesee Valley Mall. She was on a closing shift on February 17. When she got to her car having closed up for the night, she found a shirt wedged under her windscreen wiper. \n\"I got to my car and locked the doors behind me immediately as I always do and noticed that there was a blue flannel shirt on my windshield,\" Ashley said in a Facebook post. The flannel shirt was wedged under her windscreen wipers (Photo: Facebook / Ashley Hardacre) Read More \nShe wrote: \"There were two cars near me and one was running so I immediately felt uneasy and knew I couldn't get out to get it off. \n\"At first I thought maybe someone had just thrown it on my car for some odd reason.\" \nIt seems that the shirt could have had a more sinister and dangerous purpose. Ashley told Mirror Online that there have been other incidents nearby in which women have found objects placed on their cars in a bid to get them to get out and remove them. \nShe told us: \"It made me feel very uneasy and shocked. For the future I plan to spread awareness and do what I can to prevent this from happening to others.\" Ashley wants to warn others (Photo: Facebook / Ashley Hardacre) Read More Man gets revenge on ex who 'destroyed' their relationship by grading her apology letter and posting it online \nThankfully, Ashley, having heard about the distraction tactics, took precautions: \"Luckily I knew better than to remove the shirt with cars around me so I drove over to a place where I was safe and quickly rolled down my window and got the shirt off. \n\"I don't know why the shirt was on my car but it had to have been intentional the way it was put on there. I really can't think of another reason as to why someone would put it on my car.\" \nAshley informed security at her place of work, but also wanted to highlight the issue on Facebook , as a warning to other women who might be travelling alone. \n\"It definitely frightened me a little bit,\" Ashley added.
