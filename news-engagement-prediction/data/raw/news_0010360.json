If we see wrong results, it means the raw data was misleading from the very beginning. Maybe an advisor provided misleading information or some conflict emerged,” al-Jaafari told RT. \nWhile the controversial decision was unlikely a simple “mistake,” it was quite hard for the Iraqi authorities to understand the reasons behind it, as Iraq not only actively battles international terrorism but had “suffered the most from terrorism” in the past. \nREAD MORE: Iran to impose restrictions on US individuals, entities in retaliation for new US sanctions \nYears of cooperation between Iraq and the US was disregarded by those who adopted this measure, al-Jaafari believes. \n“We had a meeting with the US Ambassador in Baghdad and presented him the Iraqi position,” al-Jaafari said. “It was quite surprising for us that Iraq, a victim of terrorism, was categorized in such fashion, despite the closest US-Iraqi cooperation, presence of US military advisors and the framework of our strategic cooperation. All these factors were disregarded, and I still can’t understand what was used to justify such position. I believe the decision was premature and misled, regardless of whom made it.” Read more Trump's immigration order temporarily halted nationwide \nIt’s not a time for a hot-headed response, though, and Trump’s restrictions should be thoroughly studied “before making any decision or taking any stance.” But “mirror” countermeasures are definitely out of question at the moment, according to the Iraqi foreign minister. \n“We won’t adopt the same countermeasures. Iraq is a constitutional state, we have our government and parliament. We have separation of powers,” al-Jaafari said. “Every situation is thoroughly studied. A decision cannot be adopted immediately and easily.” \n“A state like the US should better act in a similar manner. We won’t act like that and won’t take any snap moves. We’ll carefully study this issue and then adopt corresponding counter-measures, without haste and emotions.” \nMeanwhile, a federal judge in Seattle granted a nationwide temporary restraining order on enforcing President Trump’s immigration ban. \nPresident Trump issued an executive order that banned citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the US last Friday. The controversial ban sparked mass protests across the US and has resulted in confusion and deportations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:40:21.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
