Many have no treatment options but Ella was lucky to receive a liver transplant. Picture: David Kelly Brisbane surgeon suffered fierce vilification over liver transplant unit that has saved thousands of lives Janelle Miles, The Courier-Mail February 24, 2017 1:00am \nTEARS well in Amanda Wrigley’s eyes and her voice quavers as she quotes a line from the latest Star Wars movie, Rogue One : “Rebellions are built on hope”. The 32-year-old Star Wars tragic has just dropped her youngest daughter, Ella, at school for the first time. It’s an emotionally fraught life event for many parents and their children but for Amanda, and Ella’s dad, Ken Wrigley, it’s one they feared would never come for their blue-eyed, blonde five-year-old. \nNicknamed “the Belly Monster” by her family, Ella was born with a life-threatening metabolic condition – propionic acidemia. The disorder is so rare it only occurs in about one in 80,000 births – equating to one person in a city the size of Rockhampton, in Central Queensland. In simple terms, Ella lacks a crucial enzyme, mainly found in the liver, needed to break down proteins. Common foods that are nourishing to most people are poison to those with the rare disease – even a few mouthfuls can cause brain damage and death as dangerous toxins build up in the bloodstream. \nTwo days after her birth in Cairns Hospital, in far north Queensland, Ella teetered so close to death a priest was called in to perform a bedside baptism. As she lay in a coma, her tiny body dwarfed by machines and surrounded by tubes, holy water was drizzled over her forehead before her emergency flight to Brisbane. \nBut here she is, more than five years later, her ponytail swinging in the breeze and clutching her school bag – with a Darth Vader lunchbox packed inside – on her first day of Prep at St Anthony’s Catholic Primary School in Alexandra Hills, a suburb of Redland City, southeast of Brisbane. media_camera Ella Wrigley as a newborn. Ella was born with life-threatening metabolic condition propionic acidemia. Picture: Supplied Ella Ruby Wrigley is among up to 10 per cent of ­Australians who have a rare disease – 60 to 70 per cent of them children. Many have no treatment options. But in early 2014, she became the first person with propionic ­acidemia in Queensland, and one of only a few dozen in the world, to receive a liver transplant. Her life, and that of her family, including older sister Ava, 9, has been transformed by the skill of her medical team and a rebellion that took place not in a galaxy far, far away, but in Brisbane, more than 30 years ago. \nThe medical uprising that changed Ella’s life – and those of thousands of other child liver transplant recipients worldwide – began with a surgical revolutionary, Professor Russell Strong, in the 1980s. Strong, who turns 79 in April, is the medical equivalent of Star Wars character Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise Jedi Master. Before his retirement from the operating theatre in 2005, Strong wielded a scalpel to fight liver disease with the same skill and dexterity as Obi-Wan brandished a lightsaber. \nBut the analogy is lost on the revered surgeon, a father of two, who spent so much time in the operating theatre as a younger man he confesses he’s never watched a Star Wars movie. “Obi-Wan Kenobi? I don’t know what the hell you’re talking about,” he says with a wry grin. \nMore than a decade after retirement, Strong is still ­lauded worldwide for his pioneering liver transplant ­surgery. His former colleague at Brisbane’s Princess Alexandra Hospital, Associate Professor Daryl Wall, describes him as Australia’s greatest living surgeon, “without a doubt”. “Russell has a strong personal faith,” says Wall, now the highly respected director of trauma services at Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital. “He’s deeply, ­deeply Christian. He didn’t verbalise it, but he showed it. I believe he had a gift from God, a skill and judgement used to its fulfilment for society and the future.” media_camera Professor Russell Strong. Picture: John Gass \nBut in the early 1980s, as Strong strived to set up Australia’s first liver transplant unit in Brisbane, he was subjected to fierce vilification from within and outside the medical establishment. In the lead-up to him performing Australia’s first child liver transplant on two-and-a-half-year-old Rhonda Natera in March 1985, a scathing editorial ­appeared in the Medical Journal of Australia , the country’s premier scientific publication for doctors, known for its usually conservative tone. The editorial, headlined “Surgery runs amok”, likened organ transplantation in children to the torturous medical experiments of notorious Nazi physician Dr Josef Mengele during World War II at the German concentration camp, Auschwitz. \nThe then MJA editor, Dr Alister Brass, wrote in Sep­tember 1984, six months before Strong’s successful transplant of Natera: “The medical profession in the Western nations must act to curb the extravagant behaviour of its super technologists, whose manual dexterity has far outgrown their vestigial sense of judgment, proportion and compassion.” Brass concluded: “We should all remember the past, to prevent our having to relive it in one way or ­another. No doubt the surgeons … are really nice people, kind to dogs, cats and their own children – once they take off their masks and leave the supercharged atmosphere of the operating room. But then away from the laboratory, probably Dr Mengele was kind to children too (as long as they were Aryan), and he surely had spotless hands.” \nThe hostility continued when a Brisbane-based medical ethicist, a lawyer, proclaimed in January 1985, two months before Natera’s life-saving surgery, that the immuno­suppressant drugs required by patients to prevent organ ­rejection would seriously retard the growth of children. He foreshadowed that 10-year-old survivors of the operation would look like three-year-olds – fears that turned out to be unfounded. \nDecades have passed since those days of fierce controversy, but Strong still vividly remembers a meeting at the now closed Royal Children’s Hospital at Herston, in Brisbane’s inner north, before the establishment of the liver transplant unit. “They blasted me,” he says bluntly. “I copped it. There was enormous opposition.” Desperate for donations 2:41 \nLast year we saw the highest number of organ donors and recipients in Australia since records began, but sadly that figure is still shockingly low February 18th 2013 /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Desperate for donations \nAcross the river at Princess Alexandra Hospital, where he was based, the reaction to a liver transplant service was no more positive among many of his colleagues. “They ­believed that resources would be taken away from their areas to do it,” Strong says. “There was very little support. It’s in so many areas that people have ideas or innovations and they get subjected to abuse and derogatory remarks.” \nStrong forged ahead despite the doomsayers and went on to transform liver transplantation in children internationally. Dozens of surgeons from across the globe ­travelled to Brisbane to learn from him. \nHe’s had many years to ponder how he found the strength to continue on despite such vehement resistance, but he still struggles to find the words. Maybe a Force, a higher power, was within him. “One can have deter­mination to do something you believe is right,” Strong says. “Against that, there’s always the thing about: ‘Am I being stupid? Is it going too far?’” \nBut then there were the desperate families, with hope and pleading in their eyes, whose children would have died if he had given in to self-doubt. The idea to cut down an adult liver to fit into a child had its origins in Pittsburgh, in the US, where Strong spent three months in 1983-84 learning from Dr Tom Starzl, who performed the world’s first liver transplant in March 1963. “What I realised when I was in America was that there would never be enough child donors to meet the need – and that’s a good thing. No one wants that many children to die,” Strong says. \nHe remembers doodling the idea for his cut-down liver technique on a scrap of paper one day while he was at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, surrounded by some of the world’s best liver surgeons. “They said, ‘You’re mad, you’re crazy’,” Strong recalls. “But Mark Twain once said, ‘A crank is a man with a new idea – until it catches on’, and to me that’s what it was.” \nNext month will mark 30 years since Strong successfully cut down a liver from an 80kg deceased adult donor to fit into a 6.5kg, six-month-old baby girl. In a highly complex procedure, he took two segments from the eight-segment liver and adapted the adult-sized blood vessels so they could be joined to the baby’s. \n“She was going to die without it,” Strong says. “I remember telling the parents at the time: ‘This has never been done before. But there’s no way she will live without it’.” Cordelia's cry 1:33 \nIT could save this child's life - see why organ donation is more than just ticking a box. Produced by Rebecca Sleeman. February 18th 2008 /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Cordelia's cry \nThe procedure he used that day has since been dubbed the “Brisbane Technique”. “Approximately 75 per cent of all children are transplanted by that method now,” he says. \nIn the 1990s, Strong adapted the procedure to be able to transplant a single segment from an adult liver – the largest internal organ in the body – into the tiniest of babies. “Some of the children we transplanted were less than 5kg,” he says. “The smallest baby we did was flown from interstate with acute liver failure of unknown origin. She was 24 days old, and is now 13.” \nThe procedure is technically complex, with more than a quarter of the blood supply from the heart passing through the liver, which is difficult for surgeons to access, sitting ­behind the right ribcage. Because the liver regenerates, Strong was able to use the Brisbane Technique to perform the first transplant using part of the liver from a live donor – a Japanese mum – and giving it to her son in Brisbane in 1989. More than 15,000 similar operations have since been performed internationally. \nThe ability to successfully split the liver for transplant also led to organs from deceased donors being divided and transplanted into two patients, which is what happened in Ella’s case. \nStrong, who grew up in the tiny northern NSW town of Alstonville and graduated as a dentist before studying medicine, says he feels “very fortunate” to have achieved what he did in his career, despite the naysayers. “Some men are born too soon and some men are born too late and ­others are born at just the right time,” he says. \nStrong still pops into the DonateLife Queensland office at the Princess Alexandra Hospital most weekdays. As he stands chatting to manager Tina Coco, on a wall behind him is a whiteboard with a Spanish proverb written in black. “Traveller, there is no path. A path is made by ­walking,” it reads. \nCoco explains: “You don’t follow in somebody else’s footsteps. You make your own path.” It could not be more apt as a description of Strong’s contribution to organ transplantation. Over three decades, the path Strong forged has led all the way to Ella Wrigley, one of more than 500 ­recipients of split livers in Australia since records started to be kept on the technique in 1989. Figures provided by ­DonateLife Queensland show that from its inception in 1985 to the end of last year, the Queensland Liver Transplant Service performed 1309 transplants. \nIn 2016, a record 70 people received new livers in Queensland, including 14 children. media_camera Ella before her transplant surgery. Picture: Supplied It’s June 24, 2011, and Amanda Wrigley is on a commercial flight from Cairns to Brisbane wearing pyjamas, a dressing gown, slippers, and hospital stockings designed to prevent deep vein thrombosis – the formation of a potentially ­deadly blood clot. It’s only three days since she gave birth to Ella via an emergency caesarean and there’s no time to go home for a change of clothes before the 4pm flight, wanting to spend every moment possible with her baby. Before leaving for the airport, Amanda carefully folds the clothes Ella had been wearing that morning, and packs them away, wanting to preserve her daughter’s smell for as long as possible, in case she dies and she never gets to hold her again. \nAs Amanda and Ken board the plane to Brisbane, ­doctors prepare Ella for an emergency medical evacuation to the Royal Children’s Hospital. \n“On the flight, I just remember thinking, ‘I don’t know how to organise a funeral’,” Amanda says, tears rolling down her cheeks. “Because of the shock of it all, I’d written her off as dead. That’s something I’m not very proud of. I’ve never shared that with anyone before. I think it was a ­defence mechanism.” \nElla had started having seizures and doctors struggled to stabilise her before flying her to Brisbane. She was hooked up to a ventilator to help her breathe. “The whole time we were in the air we didn’t know if she was alive or dead,” Amanda says. By the time she and Ken arrived in Brisbane, she had stopped focusing on a funeral and started clinging to hope. “Something snapped and I just went, ‘You idiot, if she hasn’t got her mum fighting for her, what’s she got to fight for?’” says the young mother who recounts the ­family’s story to provide Queenslanders with a small portal into the rare disease world. \nElla had shown no signs of illness when she was born 10 days overdue and weighing 4.1kg at 1pm on June 21, 2011. But three days following her birth, as Amanda tried to breastfeed, she noticed Ella’s breathing was laboured. Later that day, she and Ken, her mum, Tracy Petith, and Ella’s sister Ava, who was three at the time, were seated in a room with Cairns pediatrician Dr Alison Tigg being given some dire news. “She was saying how unwell Ella was, that she had a metabolic problem and she’d been in touch with ­specialists in Brisbane,” Amanda says. “I just looked at her and said, ‘She’s going to die, isn’t she?’ The reply was gentle, but ­honest: ‘Yeah, we think so’.” media_camera Pediatric metabolic specialist Professor David Coman. Picture: Mark Cranitch \nWhen the Wrigleys met geneticist and pediatric metabolic specialist Professor David Coman that evening at the Royal Children’s Hospital in Brisbane, he was more hopeful, giving their little girl 50-50 odds for survival. Ella was put on hemodialysis to cleanse her blood of toxins and within days was diagnosed with severe propionic acidemia – a genetic disorder caused by inheriting a defective gene from each parent. From that moment, the Wrigleys ­entered a world no education could have prepared them for – the isolating, life-changing domain of rare diseases. \nThey were warned many marriages do not survive the journey and, almost six years later, Amanda and Ken are no longer together. \n“You don’t come out of something like this the same people you were going into it,” Amanda says. “We’re still very good friends. We still very much co-parent our children. We’re both very happy and supportive of each other. But had we kept going as we were, we wouldn’t have been able to maintain a friendship and we didn’t go through everything we went through to end up hating each other.” On a wall in Coman’s office at the Wesley Hospital in Auchenflower, in Brisbane’s inner west, where he is director of pediatrics, is a quote: “Always be yourself! Unless you can be Batman. Then always be Batman,” it reads. Star Wars figurines are scattered across his desk. To enter Coman’s realm is to enter a world of superheroes. “Batman’s the coolest superhero of all. I’m Batman,” he says with a grin, when questioned about the reference on his wall. “Have you ever seen me and Batman in the same room?” Dressed in a loud shirt, he looks nothing like a ­superhero on this day. “I’ve got bad dress sense,” he admits. \nComan, who divides his time between the Wesley and Lady Cilento Children’s Hospital, in South Brisbane, is acutely aware the real superheroes are the families he sees every day with children who have rare diseases – families such as the Wrigleys. “It’s only rare until it affects someone you love,” he says. “A lot of people don’t realise up to one in 10 Australians has a rare disease. But statistics are stupid because if it’s you, it’s 100 per cent. \n“Having a rare disease has a big effect on the child but it affects whole families. It affects the parents, the quality of their relationships, it affects grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles; it affects siblings in a significant way.” \nIn about a third of patients he sees, Coman can ­accurately diagnose a child’s rare disease; in another third, he can be fairly sure of what’s wrong but testing is not foolproof, and in the remainder, he can give parents no ­certainty about what is affecting their child. \nDiagnosis is improving rapidly with advances in genetic testing. But the 44-year-old pediatrician says what’s ­desperately needed is advances to provide more therapies for those patients with rare dis eases. “For most of them, we don’t have a treatment option,” Coman says. For many families whose children have been diagnosed with life-­limiting degenerative disorders, his role is to walk with them through the toughest of journeys – and to provide hope in circumstances where it can be difficult to find. \n“You can’t live without hope. It’s vital,” he says. “But some of these families have to learn to live with a different type of hope.” Hope for some can be their child living long enough to see Christmas. For others it’s them being well enough to enjoy a family holiday. While it clearly brings joy to his heart to see Ella doing so well, he says his work with the families of children who have no treatment options is “equally important”. \nComan says attracting more research dollars for rare diseases is crucial to being able to provide more treatment options for patients, many of them children. Rare diseases have to compete with health issues such as obesity and smoking cessation for a share of scarce medical dollars. \n“It’s pretty hard to say that a person with a lifestyle issue has a greater requirement for health funds versus a child who has a genetic disease through no fault of their own,” Coman says. “With some of our rare diseases, the child might have an unusual look to them, which people might not have the same sympathetic approach to as with a child who doesn’t have hair from leukemia treatment. A child’s life is a child’s life, and it’s valuable no matter what the ­illness. Being a pediatrician, I would argue that it’s very valuable to put money into rare diseases.” \nThe father of two boys, who is part of the Metabolic Diseases Unit at the Lady Cilento Children’s Hospital, says having a team of specialists including psychologists, ­dietitians, social workers, physiotherapists and nurses, as well as pediatricians, is vital to optimise care for children with rare diseases and their families. “As long as I’ve been in pediatrics, that’s been the ethos of how you approach these disorders – it’s family-centred care,” Coman says. He says parents are an integral part of the team. “It’s rare, but a couple of times a year I will see a patient where the parents have made the diagnosis for their child and they should be congratulated,” he says. \nAmanda Wrigley was at home with Ella when she got the call telling her a compatible adult liver – capable of being split and transplanted into two patients – had ­become available and to bring her daughter, then aged two-and-a-half, to the Royal Children’s Hospital. Ken was in Papua New Guinea, where he works as a fly-in, fly-out airline engineer. After a “blubbering” phone call to him, the second person Amanda contacted was Coman, the spec­ialist fondly dubbed by Ella as “Dr Doofus”. He spent the rest of the day by Amanda and Ella’s side at the hospital as the toddler was prepared for surgery. media_camera Ella is a huge Star Wars fan. It had taken months to convince Amanda and Ken that a liver transplant was the right path for their daughter, particularly after being told 10 per cent of patients fail to survive the surgery. They were already acutely aware of what could go wrong. A school friend of Amanda’s had an 18-month-old daughter with biliary atresia, a disease of the bile ducts, who had died of liver transplant complications. “My only knowledge of a liver transplant (was that it) wasn’t successful,” Amanda says. But the Wrigleys’ life revolved around an exhausting regimen of counting every gram of protein Ella consumed, making sure she had enough for her growth and development, but not too much to ­potentially kill her. It was a ­precarious balancing act. “If she didn’t eat all of a meal, I’d have to weigh it and calculate how much protein she’d left behind so we could catch it up in the next meal,” Amanda says. “And if she vomited, what do you do? We had a rule – if she had two vomits, then it was straight to hospital.” In her 30 months of life before her transplant, Ella was in hospital dozens of times. Many of her veins had collapsed after being accessed so frequently to pump her with intravenous drugs. Her first haircut at 18 months old was to allow doctors to insert a cannula into a blood vessel in her head. “A nurse and I cut her hair with a razor so they could access a vein. It was the only one she had left,” Amanda says. \nIn an emotional email to family and friends to explain their decision to put Ella on the liver transplant list, ­Amanda and Ken wrote: “While we do manage her con­dition extremely well, the odds are stacked against us. At any sickness we could lose her and/or severely impair her brain function. We are extremely lucky that she has made it this far without impairment. It hasn’t been easy and our life is hard.” \nThe email went on to detail the severity of Ella’s ­propionic acidemia. “Ella is an early onset case; the long-term prognosis of any early onset case is not good. The mortality rate within the first decade is high and those who have managed to live up to and past that are not in good shape. They have vision and hearing impairment, mental and growth retardation (low IQ, less than 55).” media_camera Ella Wrigley (centre) with mother Amanda and older sister Ava. Picture: David Kelly \nAs Amanda carried Ella into the operating theatre for her liver transplant at 5.30pm on a summer’s day in 2014, Coman put on a surgical gown and went in with them for emotional support. “All day, I’d been sitting around ­crying,” she says. “At that point, I was still thinking, am I doing the right thing? I was freaking out the whole time. I remember thinking, is this the last time I’m going to feel her little arms around my neck?” \nBut the transplant was so successful Ella was sent home 11 days later, heralding a new life for the little girl and her family. In the months afterwards, with no prompting, she named her new liver “R2-D2”, after the Star Wars droid. \nEvery year since Ella’s surgery, the Wrigleys mark her “liver-versary” with presents, cake and food that she was never able to eat before her transplant, including chocolate. Although it’s a celebration, it’s also tinged with sadness as they remember the life that was lost for Ella to receive her new liver. \n“There are no words to express our thanks,” Amanda says, tearing up again. “It’s not really a second chance for Ella, it’s a whole new life for her – and us.” \nThe years since have not been without challenges. Ella and Amanda were referred to a pediatric psychiatrist when the little girl started having separation anxiety. She needed to learn how to live without her mother being a “helicopter parent”. Ava also saw a psychologist to deal with anxiety related to her sister’s illness. “I’ve always said, Ava doesn’t have the disease but she’s suffered from it,” says Amanda, who has started studying nursing at Griffith University and hopes to eventually specialise in rare diseases. “Ava has seen more than any child her age should see. Unfortun­ately, she’s had to grow up quicker than I would have liked her to.” (She could pronounce “propionic acidemia”­perfectly from the time she was five.) \nSo few children with propionic acidemia have had liver transplants, it’s impossible to predict what the future holds for the Wrigleys. Ella requires regular testing for signs of her body rejecting her donated organ. She’s also at ­increased risk of skin cancer and kidney failure because of the immunosuppressant drugs she takes. But the effect of the transplant on Ella’s health – and the flow-on benefits to her family – has been so profound, they say they would “do it all again in a heartbeat”. “Who knows what’s around the corner? Hopefully, it’s only good stuff,” Amanda says. \nThree years post-transplant, they can be certain of only one thing. The Force – of Ella’s family and her medical team – will be with her. ■ Tuesday is Rare Disease Day.
