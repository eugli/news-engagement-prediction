A + A - These books should be turned into epic web series. Pictures courtesy: Amazon/Goodreads \nAdaptation is a very serious business, especially when you're transforming the written word into cinematic excellence. But it's also something that has been done with great success. And when it comes to today's digital viewership, we really need more options. \nWhat the audience in love with everything from Netflix and Hotstar to TVF and Voot is looking for, is this--an engaging storyline, relatable or inspiring characters, and concise content. There's no better place to get these than with well-written books. And while audio books never really took off in India, web series have actually caught our imaginations. \nHere are seven books that we think will make for great web series. Picture for representation purpose. Picture courtesy: Amazon/Goodreads \nNine Lives by William Dalrymple \nWhat a great docu-drama this book would make! Travelling through the length and breadth of India, Dalrymple's seventh book traces the lives of nine Indians--a Buddhist monk, a Jain nun, a lady from Calcutta, a prison warden in Kerala, an illiterate goatherd in Rajasthan, a Devadasi in Karnataka, a Muslim woman at Lal Shahbaz Qalandar dargah, an artist from Tamil Nadu, and the Baul singers of Bengal. Such diverse backgrounds and stories could be captured in a mini-series with nine, beautiful episodes. Picture for representation purpose. Picture courtesy: Amazon/Goodreads \nThe Alchemy of Desire by Tarun Tejpal \nIf you're sick and tired of the many (or maybe, around fifty) shades of cheap sex sold by some movies and web series, try this one on for size. This book has a good take on modern sensuality and sexual encounters. With the breathtaking background of the Himalayan foothills adding to the mystery of the story, a web-adaptation of Tejpal's book can be nothing short of dramatic with a contemporary twist. Picture for representation purpose. Picture courtesy: Amazon/Goodreads \nShort stories by Premchand \nMost Premchand stories, whether they're short or novels, are remarkable because of the depth of human behaviour and interactions that they capture. This celebrated author's stories are a treasure trove for modern screenplay, especially thanks to their contemporary relevance. Whether it's stories like Kafan or Boodhi Kaki, Premchand's short stories would make for great web content. Imagine watching a story as spine-chilling as Anisht Shanka as a web series! Picture for representation purpose. Picture courtesy: Amazon/Goodreads \nSatyajit Ray \nIf science fiction is your thing, and you can't get enough of Dr Who and the like, give this amiable Indian scientist's world a try. Not many would know that Satyajit Ray can write such amazing sci-fi stories about UFOs, mystery islands, or telepathy. But these brilliant stories deserve to be read and watched. Professor Shonku could be just the face of modern Indian science that millennials will fall in love with--especially as a web series. Picture for representation purpose. Picture courtesy: Amazon/Goodreads \nAlmost Single by Advaita Kala \nJust another light and fluffy rom-com? Maybe it is. But in its light-hearted way, Almost Single touches upon the everyday struggles faced by a young woman looking for love and stability in an urban setting. Aisha's job and personal life might just be another take on yours, and who wouldn't fall in love with such a relatable character. If ever made into a web series, imagine the laughs you'll have every time she engages in a witty banter with her mother, or have a mishap during a date. Picture for representation purpose. Picture courtesy: Amazon/Goodreads \nThe Enchantress of Florence by Salman Rushdie \nFrom the great emperor Akbar to Italian Renaissance characters like Macchiavelli, Salman Rushdie's novel has the scope for a multi-national cast and setting. If not just the way this book travels across the world and plays with time, you'll be taken by the wit and wisdom of Akbar. The mystery surrounding the claims of an interloper would make for brilliant web content, especially in the hands of a talented screenplay writer. Picture for representation purpose. Picture courtesy: Amazon/Goodreads \nDevi Chaudhurani by Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay \nWhy did we just step back in time? Well, it's because some classics can make for brilliant web stories! If you've never heard of this novel written by the man who gave us Vande Mataram, you should, for the journey of a woman it traces. From being the shunned bride called Prafulla to the freedom-fighting pirate Devi Chaudhurani, this story has the power to take you back to the early days of our struggle against the British. While this book was banned by the British in 1884, it deserves to be retold in web-series format just so that you can relive the times again.
