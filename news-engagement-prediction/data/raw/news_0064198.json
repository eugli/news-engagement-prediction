Meanwhile, conservatives are concerned that Trump’s plan would result in more federal intervention and force a kind of standardization for schools previously influenced by nonprofit groups (i.e. religious denominations).\nThe prospective tax credit initiative could be included on a more substantial tax reform bill that has been delayed by the pending Obamacare repeal.\nFollow Rob Shimshock on Twitter \nSend tips to [email protected] . \nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
