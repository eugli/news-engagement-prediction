Every season brings along a new set of models whose style is every bit as interesting as what they wear during the collections. Taking to the street in self-styled pieces that demand attention, the next generation of fashion-conscious beauties brings the expertise they’ve picked up backstage or on shoots and applies it to their personal wardrobes. Insta-girls like Kendall Jenner, Gigi Hadid, and Emily Ratajkowski may garner the bulk of the attention, but these well-dressed stars are giving them a run for their money when it comes to off-duty looks. Photographed by Phil Oh Instagram: @mckennahellam Georgia-bred beauty McKenna Hellam has mastered all-American style with a closet filled with unique denim pieces and understated classics that make an impact. Throughout the NYFW snowstorm Hellam kept things chic with Sies Marjan jackets and colorful faux furs as her winter gear. Photographed by Phil Oh Instagram: selahmarley The well-dressed daughter of music icon Lauryn Hill, Selah Marley made an impact this season in the front row at shows like Michael Kors Collection and Coach where her sporty-meets-sophisticated outfits stood out. Photographed by Phil Oh Instagram: leomieanderson Blessed with the fearlessness required to tackle any trend, Leomie Anderson keeps things interesting by mixing it up. Unexpected designer wares fill Anderson’s closet from a vintage Chanel puffer coat to embellished Gucci backpacks—she knows a statement piece when she sees it. Stepping out in Acne Studios or Yeezy, Anderson gave photographers head-to-toe looks that didn’t seem contrived. Photo: Getty Images Instagram: mulan_bae Consistently cute and capable of pulling off everything from punk looks to delicate florals, Yoon Young Bae has fun with fashion on and off the runway. Embracing leather jackets, denim on denim, and luxury hoodies she and pals like Sohyun Jung create a sensation wherever they go. Photographed by Phil Oh Instagram: @cochon_j With her buzzcut, beanies, and oversize outerwear Sohyun Jung brought the energy of her Alexander Wang debut to New York with a little help from her wardrobe of edgy athleisure. She managed to provide a few style lessons girls and guys can appreciate. Photographed by Phil Oh Instagram: @frederikkesofie Though she’s already well-known for her editorial work and hair envy-inspiring mane of blonde curls, Frederikke Sofie’s ensembles are equally appealing. With the best glasses collection around and a love of minimalist essentials, Sofie is consistently elegant. Photographed by Phil Oh Instagram: @b.y.o.s.d Artsy and eclectic, photographer turned model Radhika Nair brings cool to just about any outfit. Stepping out in pattern overcoats worn with ripped denim, and novelty T-shirts accessorized with one of the latest J.W.Anderson bags, Nair has a low-key style that’s refreshingly authentic.

Documenting her of-the-moment style on Instagram Hamlin allows followers a peek at her chic ensembles from Baja East and others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:47:27.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
