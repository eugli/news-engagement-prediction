That money will also help ensure facilities are run correctly and train water system operators. \nThe budget also included over $141 million in new funding for water monitoring and testing.\nBut opposition critics say the Liberals are over-optimistic about their deadline to solve a decades-old problem.\n\"In my view that's not fast enough,\" said NDP Indigenous affairs critic Romeo Saganash. \"They've been here for a year and a half, almost. And at that race and that pace, I don't think we will get to the finish line with the remaining three and a half years.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:55:14.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
