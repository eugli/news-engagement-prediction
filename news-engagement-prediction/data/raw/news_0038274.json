But England's all-rounder Ben Stokes can become the new million-dollar baby of IPL . \n\nLast year, it was India's little-known all-rounder Pawan Negi who stole the limelight at auctions when he was bought by the Delhi Daredevils for a whopping Rs 8.5 crore. \n\nAn all-rounder fetches the maximum amount during the auction as he can help his side maintain balance and give his skipper an option to field a full-time batsman or a bowler. \n\nStokes is likely to emerge as the star of IPL auctions. According to reports, three IPL franchises will look to include the English all-rounder in their squad. \n\nStokes, who has never played in the earlier versions of IPL, has been in terrific form of late in the shorter formats of the game. He is the perfect go-to guy for several teams as he has got enough pace as well as slower delivery to confuse the batsmen. Add to that his ability to hit the ball out of the stadium. All these make him a good package for the annual cricketing extravaganza. \n\nKolkata Knight Riders (KKR): Gautam Gambhir's Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will be the team that would want to bring Stokes into its squad the most as its maverick all-rounder \n\nAndre Russel has been banned from playing competitive cricket for a year for doping code violation. The team has a settled spin attack and a stable batting order. \n\nBut it would want to strengthen its pace bowling department since it has released a couple of pacers ahead of the auction. Getting Stokes will definitely boost KKR's pace attack. But it might face tough bidding from other franchises, especially Rising Pune Supergiants and previous year's finalist Royal Challengers Bangalore. KKR has Rs 19.75 crore in its war chest. Expect some aggressive bidding as it cannot afford to miss Stokes. \n\nRoyal Challengers Bangalore (RCB): The one trophy that Virat Kohli would definitely like to have in his cabinet is the IPL. After coming so close in 2016 and finishing as runner-up will surely charge up Kohli who will make a powerful grab for it this time. \n\nRCB's Achilles heel has been its bowling. Despite having all-rounders like Shane Watson in the squad, Kohli will definitely like to have Stokes as he can be Kohli's hope in the death overs when RCB had leaked most of the runs. Inclusion of Stokes will make the side more balanced as RCB has remained over-dependent on its batting. However, with just Rs 12.82 crore in its purse, it will have to bid judiciously. \n\nRising Pune Supergiants (RPSG): One of the latest entrants in the IPL bandwagon made a disappointing debut last year when it was the wooden spoon holder. \n\nThough led by India's most successful skipper MS Dhoni , RPSG found the going tough. Dhoni will try to build a stronger squad as he had done with Chennai Super Kings (CSK) franchise before it was barred by Supreme Court. Dhoni, who has the Australian all-rounder Mitchell Marsh in his side, will like to bring Stokes as he needs another all-rounder to support Marsh. \n\nStokes will also provide stability in the lower batting order. RPSG has enough money—Rs 17.5 crore—so it will make a strong bid for Stokes.
