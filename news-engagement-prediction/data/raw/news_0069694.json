Today voters battled their way to windswept polling stations amid fears of low turnout. \nTonight political reporter Dan Bloom is at the count in Stoke while Deputy Political Editor Ben Glaze makes the journey to Copeland.\nFollow their updates all night with results, analysis and reaction below. For candidates, odds and more, read our guide to Copeland here and our guide to Stoke here. \nKey Events Compare to the results in 2015 20:54 What time is the result? 20:51 21:12 Dan Bloom Claim and counter-claim... will turnout be 30%? Now’s the time of the night for fevered speculation as the polls enter their final hour.\nOne Labour source claims turnout in Stoke is looking to be around 30%, which they actually describe as OK - considering Stoke Central had the lowest turnout in the country in 2015.\nAn earlier source said they’d be surprised if it rose above 28%.\nThe lower the turnout, the fewer votes one party needs to cause an upset.\nMeanwhile, a source claims confidently that Ukip could be knocked into third place in Stoke behind the Tories. But a Ukip source insists they’d be very surprised if that happens.\n20:54 KEY EVENT Compare to the results in 2015 Labour won both seats at the 2015 general election - it’s held Stoke since the 1980s and Copeland since the 1950s.\nIn Stoke Ukip won second place around 5,000 votes behind - and the Tories were in third, 33 votes behind them.\nCopeland is a simpler two-way fight with Labour winning a 2,500 majority over the Conservatives.\n20:51 KEY EVENT What time is the result? These things are not an exact science, but it’ll be in the wee hours.\nStoke has told us to expect a result between 3am and 4am, but it could be as early as 1am if there’s a clear result and low turnout.\nCopeland has given us a rough guide time of 3am.\n20:45 Dan Bloom Hundreds of activists flood Stoke amid fears for turnout amid Storm Doris Hundreds of activists battled Storm Doris today for a last-minute push for votes in the race to win Stoke-on-Trent Central - a Labour seat since 1950.\nLabour and Ukip each had more than 200 people knocking on doors and manning polling stations despite rain and wind battering the Potteries.\nBut Ukip leader Paul Nuttall, who was bidding to overturn Labour’s 5,179 majority, admitted: “It’s obviously going to affect the turnout.”\nThe tweed-clad candidate was forced to change his clothes after one downpour.\nHe added: “It could go any way.”\nTory candidate Jack Brereton joined his party chairman Patrick McLoughlin in Stoke to meet voters hours before polls closed:\n(Photo: PA) Labour’s candidate Gareth Snell joined MPs and activists for canvassing while other Labour activists called voters from a London phone bank.\nCampaign organiser and MP Jack Dromey claimed more than 500 Labour activists were involved on polling day.\nHe said before the result: “I think the turnout is bound to be low because of the extreme weather. This is one of the worst storms of the last 50 years.\n“I think if we win tonight Ukip are likely to end up in crisis because they would have thrown everything at their one objective and failed.\n“We’re not taking anything for granted because it remains tough and tight, but we’re cautiously optimistic.”\nStorm Doris saw a woman in her 60s hospitalised for a “serious head injury” after being hit by a carport roof in Hartshill, Stoke.\n\nA Ukip spokesman also witnessed a tree crush a children’s play area:\n(Photo: PA)   Share More On Storm Doris Politics Labour Party UKIP Jeremy Corbyn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:45:22.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
