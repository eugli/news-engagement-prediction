My sister Helen, 19 when Mum died, has the same fear. We don’t have a precedent for 53. Over the years, we’ve occasionally rung each other out of the blue, unaccountably sad, flummoxed by an intense, unprompted outburst of mum-missing grief. But reaching 52 is different. The tears lurk nearer the surface, and I find myself clutching my squirming, uncomprehending children just a little too close. Julie Stokes, a consultant clinical psychiatrist with a lifelong specialism in grief, and founder of the charity Winston’s Wish, which supports bereaved children, tells me I’m suffering from a classic case of ‘acute empathy’. We experience ‘acute grief’ after a bereavement, she says, but ‘acute empathy’ is a disenfranchised form of grief, which many people struggle to rationalise if it appears so long after the event. ‘We are always correlating our own mortality,’ says Julie, ‘and it is very typical for bereaved children to calibrate against the age when their parents die.’ I wonder if I’d feel like this at 60 if my mother had lived a little longer, or 70, or even 80, if she’d made it that far? Louise as a teenager with her mother. Louise was just 21 when Tricia died Julie says the younger the age of the parent, the more intense is likely to be the sense of loss. Certainly, when my father died eight years ago, aged 79, it felt a more natural — and somehow acceptable — age to go. He had cancer, too, but there was a longer decline and more time to prepare. Julie says, in many cases, the significant factor is the age you are when your parent dies. I feel I have no right to complain — I was 21 and an adult. But, according to her, the years between 18 and 21 are crucial formative years. ‘This is such a significant transition period, from child to adult, and the impact can be huge if you’re suddenly catapulted into adulthood with little time to prepare,’ she says. That’s what makes it so hard to deal with. I’m grieving my mother and I feel I am still her child, yet I am a mother myself and soon will be older than she was. The inventor James Dyson was just nine when his father died and has said: ‘When a parent dies, part of you grows up very quickly and part of you never grows up at all.’ That’s exactly how I feel. According to Julie, Dyson’s success, attitudes and ambitions may well have been shaped by this early bereavement, which can often create a fundamental urge to make our lost parent proud. Winston Churchill, for instance, lost his father when he was 21. Theirs had been a torturous relationship, which, historians have argued, he battled to appease all his adult life. Even as an old man, after one of the most impactful lives in history, he allegedly still worried whether he had lived up to his father’s expectations, apparently asking an aide: ‘Do you think I have done enough?’ We are always correlating our own mortality and it is very typical for bereaved children to calibrate against the age when their parents die When the aide started to list his many achievements, he interrupted: ‘No, have I done enough to make my father proud?’ Is it any coincidence that a number of other Prime Ministers also lost a parent at a young age? Theresa May lost both her parents at 25, and Tony Blair’s mother, Hazel, died of cancer when he was 22. He is quoted as saying: ‘Life was never the same after that. That was when the urgency took hold, the ambition hardened, the recognition grasped that life was finite and had to be lived in that knowledge.’ Both my sister and I have almost obsessively followed a ‘seize the day’ calling to squeeze every last drop out of every minute — something which, Julie reassures me, is common. But as my 52nd birthday approached last June, I found myself further ramping up the volume. I booked an epic long-haul trip with my daughter, took up yoga, mastering headstands and even handstands, and arranged a second honeymoon with Jon. I felt tormented by the drive to leave nothing undone, nothing unsaid, determined to wring every last drop out of every day — to make double, triple good of the days my mum had been denied. If she were still alive, my mother would be 83. I sometimes ease the agony of loss by forcing myself to imagine a shrunken, doddery version of the mum I knew, so I can be grateful my only memories are positive. When so many of my friends are trapped in the ‘sandwich generation’ between dependent children and vulnerable, ageing parents, I send a quiet whisper of thanks to Mum for checking out so soon. Julie says my struggles this year are likely to be part of a natural, protracted grieving process, which many people don’t recognise or understand. She recommends writing a letter to the parent who long ago died. This allows grown-up children to reconnect with the person they grieve for and fill them in on everything they have missed. ‘It’s not about closure,’ she says. ‘It’s about saying “Hello” again.’ I can see the appeal. If I’m honest, my real beef is not the injustice that my mother didn’t reach 53, it’s the sadness of her not seeing me graduate, not following my career (she had very low ambitions for me, which I was resolute about elevating), not meeting the love of my life, not helping me step into her wedding dress to walk up the aisle, not holding my children in her arms... She missed all of that, and it’s really cruel — for both of us. I will probably never stop craving my mother’s approval, her comfort, the soft touch of her hand sweeping the hair away from my forehead, but I think I probably have done enough. Deep down, I know she’d be proud.
