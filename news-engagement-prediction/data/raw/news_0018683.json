Their daughter Meredith was born three months early and weighed only two pounds at the time of her birth!\nAfter ten years of trying for their own baby to no avail, and dealing with a failed adoption, Nicole's unexpected pregnancy was the blessing they always hoped for! Nicole told ABC News how amazing the experience of finally being pregnant was for the two of them!\n\"We had given up all hope. I had stopped using any fertility medication and then without any help except for God, we found out I was pregnant on the day after Mother's Day.\"\nDespite their joy, doctors determined something was wrong just a few weeks into the pregnancy. The month before Meredith's birth was rough for Nicole - she was put on bed rest and spent her days in a hospital room nearly two hours away from her home.\nThree months before her due date, Nicole suddenly went into labor and little Meredith was born into the world! The terrified mother explained the toll her daughter's extremely premature birth took on the family.\n\"The doctors gave us all the scenarios of what could go wrong. We stayed with her around-the-clock as much as we could and she had nurses with her 24-7.\"\nIn the weeks at the hospital, Meredith suffered from pneumonia, an intense heart surgery, collapsed lungs, and near blindness. Nicole recounts that there was a night where doctors thought she wasn't going to make it - so she and her husband prayed nonstop and took a trip to the hospital's chapel to be closer to God.\nThey knew at any moment, He could call their tiny daughter up to Heaven and there was nothing they could do to stop it.\nScreenshot via ABC News\nMiraculously, Meredith pulled through and was released from the hospital shortly after that terrifying night. One of Meredith's NICU nurses, Loren Crews, was there through the thick and thin of Meredith's birth and her turbulent first few weeks on Earth.\nShe told ABC News that there was talk of a big celebration to welcome Meredith home, but she doubted it would really happen. Little did she know the plans that were in the works!\n\"[Meredith's] parents and her grandparents talked about how the entire community had been praying for her and rallying around her and that there was going to be a parade when she went home. We kind of took it with a grain of salt that it would happen, but it did.\"\nWhen Meredith, Blaine and Nicole were finally able to drive home, they were followed by 75 cars (filled with family and friends) waiting to escort them, streets lined with strangers holding \"welcome home\" signs, Mickey and Minnie Mouse, as well as pink fireworks that lit up the sky.\nAs they pulled into their driveway after what felt like months away, two giant teddy bears in their lawn were propped up to greet them! Their community in Middlesboro, Kentucky rallied around Meredith's homecoming and her stable health in a big way!\nScreenshot via ABC News\nSponsored\nWatch Meredith's heartwarming homecoming in the video below!\nThey say it takes a village to raise a child and that's certainly true in Meredith's case! She's going to have a support system of 12,000 loving Middlesboro residents.\nSources: ABC News , KCWY News / FB Image Credit: Screenshot via KCWY News\n\"Like\" Our Page :)", "external_links": ["http://abcnews.go.com/video/embed?id=45094501", "http://www.kcwy13.com/content/news?article=411874205", "http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/premature-baby-welcomed-home-hospital-parade-fireworks/story?id=45063396", "http://images.lifeaspire.com/2017/02/2-4.png", "http://images.lifeaspire.com/2017/02/1-5.png"], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:45:43.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
