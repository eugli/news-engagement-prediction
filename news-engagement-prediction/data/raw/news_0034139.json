There is a sense of optimism that government is leaving no stone unturned to rejuvenate the PSU segments. \n\nThe government plans to merge 13 government oil companies (to name a few ONGC , IOC , HPCL , BPCL , GAIL , MRPL, Chennai Petroleum , Numaligarh Refinery and Oil India), would not only give these companies capacity to bear higher risks, benefit economies of scale and take higher investment decisions, giving much stronger bargaining power with suppliers, and greater financial clout to secure oil resources. \n\nMoreover, at the same time would create more value for their shareholders and bring much-needed transparency. These conglomerates, post-merger, would be able to compete with domestic private sector oil and gas companies and with international players. \n\nBeside oil and gas companies, the government is considering the merger of half a dozen state-owned consultancy firms, PSU banks, government telecom companies and construction companies, which may compete with global giants. \n\nConsolidation of banks (post-SBI's merger with its five associate banks, along with Bhartiya Mahila Bank) is expected to increase capital efficiency, apart from improving their lending ability to recover bad loans which are swelling at present. \n\nThe consolidation of the construction companies such as NBCC with Hindustan Prefab, Engineering Projects India Ltd, NPCC Ltd, and HSCC is likely to unlock value and make investments in new projects. \n\nThe government is pushing consolidation within these sectors as part of one of the reforms it intends to undertake to boost the said sectors and the economy as well. \n\nThe creation of integrated firms would benefit consumers as there would be competition among players in order to provide better services to improve the performance. \n\nGovernment's move to create am 'oil major' would enable India, which is world's third largest oil consumer, to meet its energy requirements to some extent, help mitigate the rising oil prices in India and at the same it would bring down the price of other commodities too. \n\nThe government is doing its best to restore the faith and it is expected that in the days to come we may see consolidation like activity in sectors such as power, chemicals, diversified manufacturing, mining, and steel. \n\nOn the flip side, as the PSU companies are larger, more diverse, vertically integrated into operations and with overseas presence as well, the merger may face significant execution challenges. \n\nIt is expected that government would announce more policies with respect to supporting the strengthening these companies' post-merger. \n\n(The author is Chairman and MD, SMC Investments and Advisors Ltd.
