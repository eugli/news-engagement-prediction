He's much happier than he was, and now we have a great relationship with him.\" \nJethro was non-verbal, had high needs and could be very active, but \"had very little understanding of the world we know\", Sim said. \nTwo carers looked after Jethro fulltime, living on-site, at a cost to the Ministry of Health and disability charity IHC. Ad Feedback \n\"The idea [of a host family] was to place him in a family so he could develop social skills, but for someone like Jethro, he needs staff, rather than a family,\" Sim said. \nIn contrast, the Sim family had fought to keep Jesse, 35, at home, believing he would have a better quality of life staying with his parents. \nIt meant quitting their fulltime jobs to look after him. \n\"But life is valuable. We want him to experience as much as possible. We try to give him the life experiences we all take for granted,\" Sim said. \n\"We couldn't do that with Jethro. He wouldn't know what he was experiencing.\" \nSim's partner Cathy said people had criticised them for putting Jethro in care, saying they \"took the easy option\" and it was \"cruel\". \n\"People have got a thing about residential care. But you couldn't get better for our son now. They are trying strategies all the time to try and get him outside and improve his moods,\" she said. \n\"It's hard to give up your child, I cried. But we knew he would have a better life in care than what we could give him. Sometimes you have to step back from your emotions and listen to what the agencies are saying.\" \nAutism New Zealand chief executive Dane Dougan said he was disappointed to hear the Sim family had faced criticism. \n\"Autistic people are all different, and what works for one doesn't always work for the other. I've heard really good stories about adults in residential care. If the environment is right for them, it can be really positive. \n\"To criticise them for trying to make the best decision for their son, that's totally wrong.\" - The Marlborough Express", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:54:45.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
