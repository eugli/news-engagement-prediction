(THE CANADIAN PRESS/HO) The Canadian Press Published Sunday, February 5, 2017 10:25AM EST Last Updated Monday, February 6, 2017 3:58PM EST \nWINNIPEG -- A judge has found a woman guilty of disposing of the remains of six infants in a Winnipeg storage locker. \nAndrea Giesbrecht was charged with six counts of concealing the body of a dead child. \nThe judge said Giesbrecht was aware that the children were likely to have been born alive and she wished to conceal their births. \nGiesbrecht was arrested in October 2014 after police found the remains in garbage bags and other containers inside a U-Haul storage locker. \nMedical experts testified the infants were at or near full term, but were so badly decomposed it couldn't be determined how they died. \nThe Crown argued that Giesbrecht took great pains to hide the remains and her pregnancies. \nThe defence said she was saving the bodies -- not disposing of them.
