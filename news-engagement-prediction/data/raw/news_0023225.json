Photo: Port Macquarie News \nIf Dr Gillespie was referred to the High Court and subsequently disqualified it would spark a byelection in his seat of Lyne. \nThe Nationals would be likely to retain the seat but it would still be an enormous political headache for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. \nConstitutional law expert Anne Twomey, from the University of Sydney, agrees the outcome of the Bob Day case will be critical in determining whether arrangements such as Dr Gillespie's are allowed. \n\"It will depend very much upon the principles the court applies,\" Professor Twomey said. \n\"For example, it might limit the application of the provision to cases where there is a risk of the government using the pecuniary interest to influence the member or where the member is using his or her office to obtain benefits from the government. We will not know until the Day case is decided.\" \nHowever Professor Twomey says contracts that don't personally involve the MP are less likely to breach section 44(v) \"as it would not be likely to fall within the mischief that the provision was directed at\". \nSection 44(v) of the constitution says any person who \"has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than 25 persons shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives\". \nThe section is an anti-corruption measure, designed to stop people sitting in Parliament and at the same time making money through contracts with the Commonwealth. But it's also imprecise, and the limits of what's meant by \"indirect pecuniary interest\" have never been tested by the full bench of the High Court. The court is considering whether former Family First senator Bob Day was ineligible to be elected because he had an indirect financial interest over a taxpayer-funded electorate office leased to the Department of Finance. The government was given legal advice his arrangements could have breached the section. The case returned to the High Court on Tuesday. Comment on Dr Gillespie's case has been sought from Attorney-General George Brandis.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:57:33.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
