But what is the price of refined oil based on? Isn't the price of refined oil based on price of crude oil? \nSo, how can the price of refined oil go up when the price of crude oil goes down? \nKim Quek: Has PM Najib Razak’s cabinet degenerated to such an extent that it must now use its propagandists to cook up a cock-and-bull story to hoodwink the public over its petrol price hike? \nCiting the world’s refineries as being on fire as justification for jacking up petrol price is the height of stupidity and absurdity. \nWill the prime minister please explain to the nation why the relevant ministry has abdicated its duty of public accountability to the ruling party’s propagandists? \nCommentable: Yes, why is it not the government official channel that's giving the explanation instead of this so-called ‘BN Strategic Communications Team’? \nYou will know they are bluffing their way out when they start accusing legitimate and logical questioning (as to the price increase) as works of the opposition leaders and their propagandists. \nI'm not convinced, so let's have the real facts and figures please. \nClongviews: It’s always the Ministry of Domestic Trade or Ministry of Finance that makes the announcement or provide the explanation. Are they running short of excuses and therefore have to find another mouthpiece? \nAn increase of 20 sen a litre for the past two months is hard to take. It’s stupid to say that our oil prices are the \"cheapest in Southeast Asia\". We are a producer and exporter of oil! \n6th Generation Immigrant: This is just a bad carpenter (government) blaming the tools - chisel, mallet, glue, etc. The furniture (citizens) is still wobbling though. \nThere are no sudden increases in prices in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand or the US due to the shutdowns, maintenance or fires of the oil refineries. \nAt the rate this government is going, they are going to run out of excuses and start to believe in their own lies. \nJames_3392: Publish the formula for computation of retail prices of petrol and diesel once and for all. \nWe were originally told the retail price fluctuates with crude price. Since when you have added in the refining cost? You keep shifting goal posts. \nPetrol prices up 20 sen from midnight \nHardboiled: The government knows that the people are going through hard times. The prices for goods and services have increased steadily over the past year through a combination of a falling ringgit, tightening of the economy, and the raising of taxes for the ordinary folk. \nEven our reserves have shrunk. Since they know this already and yet they continue to increase prices of petrol, which will further dampen the economy, it can only mean one thing and one thing only - the government is running on fumes. \nMoney has disappeared and it has to be replaced. Borrowing and raising prices are their only recourse. \nCFH Political and Economic Studies: The hike in retail price for all petrol grades is a positive indication that the global economy is heading towards recovery after years of sluggish to negative growth for many countries. \nOther indicators such as precious metals, agricultural commodities are beginning to witness some recovery. \nInvestments and opex (operational expenditure) are poised to increase in second half of this year, which means more jobs will be created. More liquidity is expected in coming months, which will lead to increase in retail spending. \nHence, higher Brent crude prices will bring back vibrant economies like what many have experienced during the previous bull runs. \nGE14Now: Now if a certain MO1 (Malaysian Official 1) had not allegedly stolen RM2.6 billion, we could have subsidised 13,000,000,000 (13 billion liters) and not have this sort of increase. \nBut the needs of the MO1 outweighs the needs of the rakyat in this country of grand corruption. \nFairman: Why does the PM's Department need about RM20 billion for this year? Part of the money can be channelled for the well-being of the rakyat. \nAs MO1 said, this is going to be a very \"interesting \" year. \nTangling: US$56 per barrel – RON 95, RM2.30 per litre; RON 97, RM2.60 per litre. \nIf US$100 per barrel – what will RON 95 and RON 97 prices be? \nBandar Tun Razak BN to provide free petrol monthly \nPDev Anand Pillai: As long as the handouts and the dole is meted out to the peasant class, the Malays will continue to vote as directed. \nIt happens in many other democracies, especially in countries like India, so it is no surprise that our politicians are following suit. It is all for the damn vote. Who cares for these poor folks? \nWarrant Addict: This is chicken-feed and nothing to shout about. Please do what the Sungai Petani cikgu (teacher) did – giving out petrol, cooking oil, rice and much more; not only for two hours but five hours. \nJaycee: Bandar Tun Razak BN division head Rizalman Mokhtar does not get it. Instead of \"teaching these people to fish\", the government continues to give handouts. \nSurely these motorcyclists know that the free petrol given is a miniscule amount compared to the billions that the government had allegedly stolen from the rakyat. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers.
