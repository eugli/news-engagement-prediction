Albinos are being hunted in Africa and 'harvested' for their body parts \nThe constitutional referendum was hotly contested and Prime Minister Renzi resigned after he lost to the No side. \nFrom the city of pizza, Paola of Naples, is apparently delivering on her promise despite having ‘jaw ache’. \nShe said that so far she has far donated her oral services to 400 voters who rejected reducing the number of MPs, limiting the operating costs of the institutions and giving greater power to the PM amongst other measures. Saulino needs to know there is a demand before she extends her tour (Pictures: Paola Saulino) \nThe Pompa Tour captured headlines and many’s imagination and was split into a 10-date jaunt followed by a second 12-date journey through Italy. \nBeing a ‘woman of her word’ Saulino is aiming for ‘one million’ blowjobs. \n#SwedenStrong trends in response to Donald Trump's 'made up' terror attack Now the more than 100,000 Italians who live in the UK can look forward to her arrival as she promises a trip. \nRevealed by the Daily Star Online the Italian wants to pleasure the ‘smart’ voters who rejected the constitutional reforms. \nShe told the paper: ‘The British Italians who voted ‘No’ in referendum are very smart.
