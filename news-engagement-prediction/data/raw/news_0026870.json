Then-national intelligence director James Clapper and then-CIA chief John Brennan agreed with Yates, fearing “Flynn had put himself in a compromising position,” the Post reported.\nThe Associated Press and New York Times also reported the Justice Department’s warnings Monday. It is unclear what, if anything, McGahn did with the information. Yates was fired Jan. 30 after refusing to defend President Donald Trump’s temporary immigration ban.\nFlynn reportedly had a number of phone calls with Russia’s ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, both before and after Trump’s November election victory. Flynn, the White House and Vice President Mike Pence all publicly denied that Flynn discussed easing recent U.S. sanctions against Russia in those conversations, but Flynn has recently admitted that the subject may have come up before Trump’s inauguration. If so, such conversations could have been illegal.\nFlynn has since reportedly apologized to Pence and other White House officials.\nTrump and his top aides are said to be “evaluating” Flynn’s status , though senior Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said Monday that Trump had “full confidence” in Flynn.\nHouse Democrats have called for an investigation, and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) said Monday that Flynn should be fired since he ”cannot be trusted.”\nI want to be very clear: President Trump must fire National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. #FireFlynn https://t.co/iHZH1Pfkcz\n— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) February 13, 2017 Michael Flynn has proven he cannot be trusted to serve America’s best interests and national security instead of Russia’s. #FireFlynn\n— Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) February 13, 2017 More from MarketWatch Kellyanne Conway Accused of Ethics Violation The Best Ways to Use Your Smartphone in the Car Marathon Pharmaceuticals Charging $89,000 for Muscular Dystrophy Drug", "external_links": ["https://www.yahoo.com/news/embattled-national-security-advisers-fate-uncertain-082522705--politics.html", "https://t.co/iHZH1Pfkcz", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FireFlynn?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/NancyPelosi/status/831212449844051968", "https://twitter.com/NancyPelosi/status/831214581909446656", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-evaluates-the-fate-of-adviser-mike-flynn-1487034018", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/13/us/politics/donald-trump-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/justice-department-warned-white-house-that-flynn-could-be-vulnerable-to-russian-blackmail-officials-say/2017/02/13/fc5dab88-f228-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_flynn-0818pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory&utm_term=.c112f094c9b1"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:38:27.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
