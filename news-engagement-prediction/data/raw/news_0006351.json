In order to make absolute sure on retaining power, there will be more propaganda to come. \nBN will make sure it gets its way. After all, the billions are in their hands. \n6th Generation Immigrant: Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Daim Zainuddin, Anwar Ibrahim, Musa Hitam, Najib Abdul Razak and many more should now all sue one another. \nCleanse Umno of 50 years of abuses. Let this be settled once and for all (hear ye! hear ye! all you so-called Umno nationalists who would like to join the bandwagon, the time has come and is now ripe). \nAll in all, whoever ends up the winner from amongst these top echelon leaders and members, Umno's true colours and philosophies will be an open book from there on. \nMalaysians waiting on the sidelines are waiting to lament \"we told you so\". The rural Malays will finally be convinced that they had been taken for a real ride. Malaysia shall be saved. \nThe Analyser: Listed off here is every possible reason why Mahathir's crimes are less awful than Najib's... and some pretty damning evidence to suggest that they are as bad, if not worse. \nThe bottom line for people with flexible principles is that a scandal is a scandal, incompetence is incompetence. It is not a matter of scale, but a matter of fact. \nWhile you are debating the pros and cons of financial scandals, you are overlooking the real crimes against this society. In that regard, Mahathir far outperforms Najib, who is a mere amateur who did not learn much from his mentor. \nCrimes against the constitution, the royals, Islam, human rights, democracy, egalitarianism... even human dignity. \nIt is a measure of how truly shallow the Malaysian society is that one places money crimes above crimes against one’s democratic rights and one’s rights as human beings. \nPg People: Even if it is true that Mahathir is involved in the BMF (Bumiputra Malaysia Finance) scandal, that doesn't allow MO1 (Malaysian Official 1) a free ticket to whack the rest. \nHe should instead file a lawsuit against Mahathir without bringing up other scandals, as one plus one does not equal two. \nFiq Rayyan: I can see why people are very appreciative of Mahathir, especially when he vowed to fight PM Najib Razak. \nThere are so many things that we don't know about him because before this he controlled everything, including the media. \nI don't want to be a person who support someone blindly. In my opinion, I think there are no one we can put our trust in right now. \nRick Teo: Twenty years ago, Najib was part of the cabinet. If there was any misdeed committed, he would also be an accessory to the crime. \nAziz Kader: Umno accepted the forex (foreign exchange) and BMF imbroglio from day one. Now they claimed they were scandals. \nIf 20 or 30 years from now, should Najib be still alive and support the opposition, 1MDB would also then become a scandal for Umno. \nRes Ipsa: Do we really care since the prime concern of most Malaysians is the present state of affairs and how to get food on the table for our loved ones. \nOf utmost concern is also the immediate future of our children. So, is it really necessary to dwell on past issues that are not going to have any effect on the current state of affairs? \nAnonymous 2411361459930771: The cabinet would be spitting on its own face if it consents to probing BMF but not 1MDB, which is a clear and present danger. \nOdin Tajué: Yes, Jordan ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ Belfort knew the 1MDB imbroglio was a \"fu**ing scam\" and called Jho Low, Riza Aziz and the rest of those involved \"fu**ing criminals\". \nI agree with him, of course. \nGerard Lourdesamy: The Malaysian authorities are not interested in investigating 1MDB but rather are attempting the biggest cover-up in legal history just to protect MO1, his stepson and Jho Low. \nThe former attorney-general (AG) was sacked, Bank Negara and the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) had their officers retired or removed. \nThe police were intimidating and harassing all the other agencies. The special task force on 1MDB was disbanded. And a new AG was appointed just to exonerate everybody. \nUnfortunately, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and other foreign governments exposed the lies and the wholesale criminality of those involved. The rakyat know better whom to trust. \nRick Teo: Indeed, when you spend money without a care in the world, it’s likely that the money was stolen. \nAnonymous_1377321471: MO1 is the root of all evil and becoming bolder and bolder by the day with the presence of his allegedly criminal cohorts at the expense of the rakyat and nation. \nHe is seen every day and night on the prowl and yet invisible to all of Malaysia's authorities of law and enforcement. \nIt must be the ‘honey coat’ he is wearing that makes him a ghost. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers.
