Stowe’s reputation as a premiere ski destination is regularly affirmed with the priciest lift tickets in New England, reaching $124 for the 2016-2017 season. Vail Resorts’ flagship Vail ski area regularly boasts the most expensive lift tickets in the country, reaching $189 a day this season. \nThat high pricing pushes more skiers toward its industry-shaking Epic Pass. The company sold 650,000 of the passes this season. The addition of Stowe gives East Coast skiers a reason to join the expanding Epic Pass club and travel West to visit more Vail Resorts hills. Stowe will be part of the Epic Pass program for the 2017-18 ski season, which will reduce season pass prices at Stowe — which reached $2,000 for 2016-17 — by about half. \nLast year was painful for Stowe, which saw its worst natural snowfall in its 80-year history on the east face of Vermont’s towering Mount Mansfield. Skier visits plummeted. Across the Northeast, skier visits fell 28 percent while visits to Colorado reached a record 13 million. Vermont’s 20 ski areas reported 3.2 million skier visits in 2015-16, down 1.4 million from the record-setting season of 2014-15. \nStowe’s 70-year owner, insurer American International Group’s global real estate arm, has been divesting assets in recent years and Stowe seemed a likely property to jettison. The company will retain majority ownership of the base area property, including a 312-room lodge and a country club anchoring the mountain’s Spruce Creek community. That fits Vail Resorts’ mountain-first approach to recent acquisitions, where it operates the ski area and lets partners handle base area residential and commercial development. It also fits the AIG strategy of retaining some financial connections to assets it sells. \nDouglas Tymins, the head of AIG Global Real Estate, said in a statement that Vail Resorts would grow Stowe’s reputation as a top ski destination. \n“AIGGRE is looking forward to combining Vail Resorts’ tremendous mountain operations capabilities with our continued commitment to the development of the Spruce Peak community,” Tymins said in the statement.
