The ball should bounce the same for everyone. Worth should outshine color. 'If we can be equals here, we can be equals everywhere.' The majority of responses to the add was positive, despite it being able to potentially be seen as political. 'This one actually gave me goosebumps. Well done @Nike,' Abby Milloy tweeted. Continuing the aerial theme, the commercial then shows a soccer field as people play near a busy road Soccer star and LGBT activist Megan Rapinoe is one of the athletes in the ad who is given a prominent role Basketball star Kevin Durant also features in the 'Equality' campaign, and is seen walking through the streets Durant, who plays for the Golden State Warriors, crouches down and spray paints a white line across the road in the commercial 'This isn't a response to @UnderArmour - @Nike has been pushing equality and social justice for a minute. Bravo,' another fan said. 'Definitely applauding the new #Equality video by @Nike,' one person wrote. 'How long before white conservatives attempt to boycott @Nike for their #Equality campaign? Love this campaign,' Anthony Nicodemo added. But, as with all things - especially those that are perceived to be political, others took shots at Nike over the commercial. A young woman wearing a head-dress is shown running during the commercial, as well as in the still shot Olympic hurdler Dalilah Muhammad is seen in the ad leading a group of women as they run along a road during the commercial 'Here, within these lines, on this concrete court, this patch of turf, here, you are defined by your actions. Not your looks or beliefs,' Jordan says in the ad 'No Asians. No Europeans. No Africans. No Australians. Yes, we can be equals in sport. Just not in a @Nike ad that claims so,' Jonathan Rego tweeted about the North American campaign. 'This is a STUPID commercial..we have Title 9. Also @Nike how equal do you pay the folks that make your products???' another person said. Nike said in a statement that campaign is a continuation of the organization's desire to create a fair and respectful world - both on and off the field. 'Nike believes in respect and equality - and that these values are worth standing up for and supporting,' the statement read. Alicia Keys performs in the campaign, and can be heard throughout the spot singing Sam Cooke’s 'A Change Is Gonna Come' Alicia Keys is seen playing the piano and singing while stood in front of a wall that reads: 'equals everywhere' The commercials ends by again showing LeBron James, who says: 'If we can be equals here, we can be equals everywhere' A huge crowd of people is filmed rushing towards the basketball court in the final moments of the ad, before the slogan, 'equality has no boundaries' is shown The last image from the commercial is a young girl on her father's shoulders among the diverse crowd of people gathered around the court Nike, LeBron James, Serena Williams, and other stars from the commercial promoted it on social media after the campaign was launched 'EQUALITY follows Nike’s recent announcement of its partnerships with MENTOR and PeacePlayers International, to drive change within communities. 'Building on these partnerships, Nike will donate $5 million in 2017 to numerous organizations that advance equality in communities across the US, including MENTOR and PeacePlayers.' MENTOR is a program that encourages people to work with their local community and to help young people, while PeacePlayers is a foundation: 'bridging divides, developing leaders and changing perceptions'. The reaction to the ad on social media was largely positive, however some people seemingly took offense to it as well Share or comment on this article 141 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T13:30:28.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
