Maybe once a week, at most, the Carmel High School basketball team will run it in practice. \nDoes it work? \n“No, not usually,” admitted P.J. Baron. “Some of the time we hit it. But no, not usually.” \nIt worked on Friday, to perfection. With 2.1 seconds left on overtime against Class 4A top-ranked Warren Central, Carmel sophomore Luke Heady launched a 65-foot pass to Baron at the top of the key. Baron turned and found a wide-open Sterling Brown on the right wing. \nBrown let the 3-pointer fly, finding nothing but net. Final: Carmel 70, Warren Central 68 in overtime. \nWhew. \n“Basically, it’s a football pass,” Brown said. “We’re in the bonus and just trying to make something happen. Luke made a great pass and P.J. made a great catch and read it well. I got a clean look off of it.” \nIt appeared that Warren Central (18-2 overall, 5-1 Metropolitan Interscholastic Conference) might escape with win – and the outright MIC title – after trailing almost the entire night. The Warriors took their first lead in overtime after battling back from a 14-point fourth-quarter deficit with leading scorer Mack Smith on the bench with five fouls. \nAfter Baron tied the score 67-67 on a pass from Brown with 58 seconds left in overtime, Warren Central played for a final shot. After Warren Central coach Criss Beyers called a timeout with 14.7 seconds remaining, David Bell grabbed an offensive rebound and was fouled with 2.6 seconds left.
