Princes William and Harry said in a statement: \"It has been 20 years since our mother's death and the time is right to recognise her positive impact in the UK and around the world with a permanent statue.\" They continued: \"Our mother touched so many lives. We hope the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on her life and her legacy.\" \nPHOTOS: The best royal hugs \nIn an exclusive interview with HELLO! last May, Prince Harry said he and his brother were determined to create a \"permanent memorial\" to their mother. He said: \"We want to make sure that there's something that she's remembered by and there's certainly not enough on the right scale in London or anywhere in the UK that she's remembered for. And I think myself, William and a few other people, we all agree on that.\" The fifth-in-line to the throne added: \"Something needs to be put in stone or in place as a memory. Lots of people still talk about her. Every single day we still think about her, so it would be very fitting on the 20th anniversary to have something that is going to last forever and is actually a proper recognition of what she did when she was alive.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T12:55:44.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
