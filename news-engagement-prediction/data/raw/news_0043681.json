Markus and Maria launched Viking Coffee last year and plan to open a public roastery in Invercargill. \nAn Invercargill business couple have launched a coffee roasting venture to fill what they call a need in the city for quality, speciality coffee. \nViking Coffee owners Markus and Maria Hirner are looking for an Invercargill premises for a public roastery and hope to start training new baristas. \nMarkus said changing perceptions of barista work as \"just another job\" could improve New Zealand coffee. SUPPLIED \nROAR coffee co-director Steve Taylor and head roaster and company director Kelly Taylor. \n\"In Germany, Sweden, some states in America and Australia, they have got training facilities there and they consider it as a career option. \nREAD MORE: \n\"In New Zealand I think we feel that it's just another job,\" he said. \nInvercargill needed to support its hospitality culture, he said. \n\"We need to be a bit more of a thriving hub, and to get some noise going on.\" \nThe couple noticed the city had no speciality coffee roasters and started Viking Coffee in a private premises in August last year. \nThey also manage Global Byte cafe. Ad Feedback \nWhen Bill Richardson Transport World's cafe The Grille and Meccaspresso Cafe opened, city activity soared, Markus said. \nPeople seemed to be getting out and about more and Global Byte had more customers through the door. \n\"My drive was I wanted something better in coffee,\" Markus said. \n\"We were at the point where we said, \"We need to advance this in Invercargill'.\" \nThere was a \"100 per cent\" gap in the speciality coffee market in the city, Markus said. \nThey noticed a migration of Aucklanders to Invercargill, which they said could be because of cheaper housing. \n\"We definitely notice the people from further away, they know coffee really well, and they can tell the difference.\" \nWithin six months they hope to open a public roastery, which could double as a training ground for new baristas. \n\"We find in Invercargill that it's hard to find baristas. We often have to get them from out of town.\" \nAuckland, Wellington and Dunedin were the coffee hubs, and the regions needed to catch up, Markus said. \nROAR coffee head roaster and company director Kelly Taylor said she too saw the need for locally roasted and supplied coffee in Southland. \n\"Anyone can distribute coffee but when it's the roaster that's personally delivering it and coming to say hi, it's about building relationships and looking after each other.\" \nThere was room for improvement in the region's barista training, she said. \n\"It's often lacking because it's sometimes not considered to be as important as it needs to be,\" she said. \n\"Successful cafes employ the right people who create the passion around their coffee.\" \nIn terms of quality coffee, Southland was starting to align with other parts of New Zealand. \n\"Now that the quality product is becoming available and readily supplied locally, it's up to the consumer to also demand more from their cup.\" \nIndustry and Batch cafe co-owner Donna Hamilton said they trained all of their baristas in-house, which would take about six months full-time on the coffee machine. \nShe said getting the right barista in Invercargill depended on whether the person had passion. \n\"But it can take a long, long time to find that spark,\" Hamilton said. \n\"People under-value them, it's an amazing profession.\" \nHamilton said Invercargill's coffee scene was no better or worse than other places. \n\"No matter what city you go to, there's good coffee and bad coffee,\" she said. \n\"Invercargill people really appreciate good coffee and they know what good coffee is.\" \nInvercargill was growing, getting busier, and new cafes were opening, she said. \n\"We should be proud of it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:42:21.423+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
