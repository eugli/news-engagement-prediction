(Picture: Getty) \nThe north/south divide is real and it’s going as strong as ever. \nSure, we’re all part of one nation – one global community, if you want to go the whole hog. 10 things southerners do that make northerners want to fight them \nBut how can we ever hope to achieve world peace when the northerners and southerners of one small island can’t even figure out how to get along? \nThe solution, obviously, is for northerners to give up and just do things the southern way – the PROPER way. \nHere are 10 things northerners do that drive southerners mad. Have a go at our southern pronunciations \nWe southerners don’t really care how northerners want to pronounce words. \nCertain words sound better with a northern accent, like basically all swear words (unless you’re Danny Dyer-levels of southern, in which case you obviously swear the best). \nBut, northerners, stop using the whole ‘bath doesn’t have an ‘r’ in it’ excuse when the town of Marske in North Yorkshire DOES have an ‘r’ in it, and yet you still pronounce it the northern way. \nYou don’t have a leg to stand on, I’m afraid. Chips and gravy/curry sauce \nThe whole point of chips is that they’re crispy on the outside, so why the hell do you want to make them soggy?!? \nMadness. Ugg boots and a mini skirts in winter At least this person is appropriately dressed for northern weather (Picture: Getty/Metro.co.uk) \nWhile it’s nice that you want to keep your tootsies warm, maybe you should sling a coat on as well? \nOr at least some tights? \nA jumper, maybe? \nYou make us feel cold just looking at you. Calling strangers by weird names \nDown south, a taxi driver might call you ‘darlin’. That’s about it. \nUp north, you get ‘pet’, ‘duck’, ‘hen’, ‘poppet’, ‘chuck’… it’s too much. Being too friendly Please stop talking to me, I don’t know you (Picture: Getty) \nWe view your over-bearing friendliness towards utter strangers as, at best, nosy, and, at worst, threatening. \nA nod and a hello in the street is pleasant, but asking us about our entire family lineage while telling us in detail about your recent divorce is taking it too far.
