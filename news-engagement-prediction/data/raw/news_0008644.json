The event celebrates religious freedom and Muslim women‚Äôs right to wear a head covering. \nThe intention behind the tradition is to give non-Muslims and non-hijab-wearing Muslim women an opportunity to experience the hijab for a day, said founder Nazma Khan on the World Hijab Day website . \nNot all Muslim women agree that such solidarity actions are effective in combating bias. Some argue that the media‚Äôs focus on the hijab only serves to further marginalize Muslim women, many of whom take issue with the hijab‚Äôs complicated social and political history. \nBut for many Muslim women, National Hijab Day offers a chance to celebrate the religious freedoms enshrined in the U.S. Constitution ‚Äï especially at a time when it seems some of the country‚Äôs leaders have lost sight of them. \nOlympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad tweeted her support of the event on Wednesday, ending her comments with hashtag the ‚Äú#resist.‚Äù Blessed to live in a time where I have the freedom to wear what I want.
