Joe Burke The newly-painted Leeds Freedom Bridge \nAlthough first proposed in 2012, it took some time to get the bridge’s new look approved. \nWork was completed on it shortly before Valentine’s Day. \nThe bridge, dubbed the Leeds Freedom Bridge, looks rather more colourful that it did before its facelift: \nLGBT campaigner Thomas Wales came up with the idea for the bridge, which carries trains across the city’s Lower Briggate. \nAccording to the Yorkshire Evening Post , the repaint was funded by money from cash donated by people from city’s LGBT community and Leeds City Council. \nPink News reported that Wales said: “Each colour represents something different, from Life and Harmony to Nature and Spirit. \n“It is also a scheme that has been adopted internationally to celebrate freedom in sexuality and gender identity in our city. \n“It is destined to become a landmark we can all be proud of.” \nHe told Gay Star News he saw the bridge as a “a shining beacon that brightly highlights the fact that the LGBT community don’t have to hide away”.
