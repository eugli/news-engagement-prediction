We wonder why he could say that clearly first up.... By Rajat Tripathi | Updated: February 3, 2017 6:43 pm comments \nAnd almost a week after hundreds of speculations doing the rounds, Bigg Boss 10 winner Manveer Gurjar has finally admitted, on camera, in clear cut words, that he is in fact married. You know what..the problem has just began. \nManveer Gurjar along with the co-contestant Manu Punjabi made a brief exit from the Bigg Boss 10 house, and entered a mall in Vashi, to interact with fans and ask for votes. I, along with my colleague, reached the mall to witness the madness with my own eyes. And madness is a small word. It was a frenzy. 90 episodes later, I came to know about the enigma that Manveer was. I finally saw how made fans were over him. There was hardly any square inch left on the floor, where I could stand properly. And the majority of attention was being directed at Manveer, and in that moment I knew he will win Bigg Boss 10. So, when you win the biggest reality show in India by winning people’s hearts because fans bared their heart out to you – you don’t get to hide such crucial fact about your life. But in Manveer’s own words, and delayment, he didn’t think it was important. That is called duping your audience, my dear friend.

In one of initial episodes of Bigg Boss 10, when contestants were getting to know each other, Manveer told,Bani J, hesitantly, that he is married. And this too came after Bani probed him a little. After some more probing he said that he has a daughter too. And went on to say ‘Hi’ to his daughter on camera, after Bani asked him to. How did we all miss it? \nManveer – Nitibha’s friendship After Manu Punjabi left the home to attend to his mom’s last rites, Manveer became friends with Nitibha Kaul . The two’s friendship got everyone talking and they were seen as the second ‘couple’ after Manu Punjabi and Mona Lisa. Buzz is that Nitibha’s eviction was delayed as people were liking their chemistry. When she came back on the show, she said that Manveer’s fans were calling her bhabhi. Well, it was the Nitibha Kaul who indirectly triggered off all the shaadi talk.

They said Nitibha was far too outgoing for their homely boy. If was said by Manveer’s bhabhi who clearly forget her devar’s marital status in the excitement of the moment. \nVideo alert and reactions Things were awry when a wedding video of Manveer surfaced in a regional website. The Bigg Boss 10 winner looking younger was dressed as a groom riding the horse. We also saw pictures of his bride. The news went viral and everyone was stunned. Manveer’s mother Mala Devi said that the report was false and that her son was unmarried. She said people should not believe such reports coming out from anywhere. Co-contestants like Rohan Mehra expressed their shock. \nManveer’s denial The man himself said in a statement, “I am not married. Shaadi jaisi cheez aise chhup nahi sakti. I have been in the Bigg Boss house since October. Agar yeh sach hota toh ab tak kisi ne toh issue raise kiya hi hota. This has just been done by someone for cheap publicity.” Ohk! \nUncle’s confirmation However, his uncle told a daily that he was indeed married for three and a half years and father to a daughter, Aashi. Manveer’s maternal uncle, Karan Singh Nagar told The Times of India, “He was married three years ago. He also has a one-and-a-half-year-old daughter named Aashi. He never hid the fact on the show. He had shared it with Nitibha, who was trying to get close to him as well as with Lopamudra and Manu Punjabi. Even Salman bhai was told about it. There were too many intelligent people there. How did a common man rise amid them?” \nKnot a great idea A cousin of his told the paper that the marriage was hidden for a reason. Manveer had been preparing for Bigg Boss 10 and confirming that he was a married man with kids would have dented his popularity. We had heard of celebs hiding their marital status but here was a common man who played the card even before he became a celeb. \nFinal admission We guess that Manveer finally understood that everyone would badger him with queries on his actual married status and said, “Whether I am married or no has nothing to do with the show. If people are wondering why I didn’t mention about my marriage then let me tell you, my terms with my wife were itself so horrible. Blame it on emotional blackmail, or family pressure, I got married in 2014. Everything was good until the first 5-6 months but soon things started falling out from her end. Now you can say she dumped me and left or decided to stay apart. Eventually, I started preparing for Bigg Boss 10 so nowhere I could sink in that feeling of being married or I will use this as a strategy on the show. You have watched me on the show. I have never tried to take advantage of anybody, or shown any kind of jealousy. I have played as Manveer and whatever I was inside the house is the real me. I didn’t play the game as a game but lived there like a housemate.” \nHe further explained it saying that he was not living with his wife for the last one and a half year. But now, after his return from Bigg Boss, her family has dropped her to their place. He said, “As of now, even I don’t know what are the terms and what should I do, what should be my next step. But as soon as I find a closure to this, I will inform you guys. But please don’t feel I have used this to gain sympathy or any of those sorts.” \nAll this drama and fuss makes us wonder, did we fans make a mistake? Did India made an idol out of a wrong person? Was India fooled? Where exactly is this wife we all are wondering about? Well, seems like the controversy has just begun. Keep watching Bigg Boss 10: The Aftermath. \n(Additional Text Courtesy: Urmimala Banerjee)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:02:24.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
