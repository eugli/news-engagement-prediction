Read More \nIraqi forces, with the support of Western allies, have been engaged in a major offensive against ISIS in the city for months. ‘HIGH THREAT’: Jamal Al-Harith was held in Guantanamo Bay \nIS claimed on Tuesday that Abu Zakariya was one of two militants involved in the attack on a Shiite army outpost. \nIS said the attack caused a number of casualties. \nThere has been no official confirmation of the death, and it is unclear when the attack took place. \nThe Britani suffix has been used regularly for militants from the UK. \nA Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, and against all travel to large parts of Iraq. \n“As all UK consular services are suspended in Syria and greatly limited in Iraq, it is extremely difficult to confirm the whereabouts and status of British Nationals in these areas.” \nAround 850 individuals of national security concern have travelled to join the conflict, according to figures published by the Government last year. \nOf those, just under half have returned to the UK and approximately 15 per cent are dead. \nIraqi forces launched a huge offensive on October 17 to retake the city - Iraq’s second largest. \nThey retook control of the eastern side of Mosul last month. \nIS fighters of a variety of nationalities, including Britons, have carried out suicide attacks on many occasions in Iraq and Syria in the past three years.
