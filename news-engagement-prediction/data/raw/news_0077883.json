I've been enjoying incredibly diverse culture in Ashbourne learning a historic game called Shrovetide football and everyone has been amazing Nonetheless we all can't wait to play out here @NFLUK next season!!! Gonna be crazy experience and I'm excited about it! I ❤️ England! — Mark Ingram II (@MarkIngram22) February 28, 2017 \n“We pull up to Cirque le Soir where we have reservations and this is what they tell us. \n“They told us they were \"six big guys\" that are too \"urban\" but nobody taller than 5'11!” \nThe player, who is due with his team to play the Miami Dolphins at Wembley Stadium on October 1, specified this had been an isolated incident and added: “Nonetheless we all can't wait to play out here @NFLUK next season! Gonna be crazy experience and I'm excited about it. I [love] England!” They’re in London, sadly, getting the same BS they get back home. ☹ https://t.co/2ZiKbpdrE7 — Crimson Clio (@CrimsonClio) February 28, 2017 Londons pretentious nightclub policy has hit peak level when NFL players can't get in. On a Monday 😭😂 @MarkIngram22 @TheVonnBell7 #toourban — David Howells (@Thaidai3) February 28, 2017 \nAfter Ingram’s series of tweets, the hashtag “too urban” began trending on Twitter - with people using it to hit out at the club and accuse it of “racial profiling”. \nOne person tweeted: “@CirqueLeSoir define #toourban? Oh, you mean too Black. In my experience, London has never quite taken to diversity well.” So what is the definition of #TooUrban , @CirqueLeSoir ? Curious minds want to know? Looks like 6 smiling men to me. 🤔 https://t.co/gHP23hOiKE — ⚜️Denise Hunnings⚜️ (@DeniseHunnings) February 28, 2017 \nAnd other person said he had the same experience at the central London club, writing: “@DrinkysPA bouncer also told me and my college educated friends we were #toourban when we tried to go there. I feel your pain @MarkIngram22.” Exclusive: The Soho club (Google Maps) \nOne Twitter user wrote: “Reading @MarkIngram22's story about being #TooUrban only reminded me of a myriad of experiences I encountered in my lifetime. Sad to hear it.” \nThe club has previously come under fire after it emerged in 2015 that a promoter allegedly sent out messages to guests telling them “do not bring any fat girls/guys. Cirque will turn people away.” \nCirque distanced itself from the incident, saying it did not represent company policy. \nIt describes itself as “one of the most successful clubs in the world” and claims that guests are “treated to a thrilling assault on the senses from every angle.” \nCirque le Soir was contacted by the Standard but declined to comment.
