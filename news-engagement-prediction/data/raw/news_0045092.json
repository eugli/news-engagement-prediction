Gruber came. The full exchange \nL ena’s mother, Molly Draper, said she didn’t believe her daughter had actually messaged the police for homework help until she saw proof of the exchange. \nShe shared the photo on Facebook, thanking the police for their response: “My daughter. Cause... She's my daughter. Thank you, Marion, Ohio Police Department, for truly building relationships with the community.” \nIn an interview with ABC News she explained: “I didn’t believe her and asked for a screenshot. I though it was pretty funny. And I love that they went ahead with it. \n“I was happy, but not surprised that they responded so quickly. They are wonderful with their communication with the community.” \nThe police force posted on Facebook: “Happy to offer her some help. Next time we will use one of our ‘lifelines’ for the math questions.” \nThey added: “Thanks for the kind comments. We loved Marion but especially true with our kids…” \nUnfortunately, many Facebook users were quick to point out that the police officer actually got the answer to the maths question wrong.
