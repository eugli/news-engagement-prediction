The neighborhood of Westpoint, in the capital city of Monrovia, was ground zero for Ebola and was also the area where most of Katie Meyler’s students lived.\nMeyler, an American who had moved to Liberia years earlier as a recent college graduate, turned her school into an emergency response headquarters and raised money to buy two ambulances. She also bribed her way into the quarantined Westpoint so she could provide emotional support to the families of her students.\n“Our plan was to do everything you can to keep everybody alive and then when you can’t do anything else, bring dignity in death. Singing to people, praying with people while they died.”\nAnd at a time when many Westerners had left the country, Meyer used social media — especially Instagram — to let people around the world know what was happening. She said she knew that by staying in Liberia, she was risking her life, but she felt it was her duty to stay.\n“I’d rather die at 30 years old, living for what I really believe from head to toe in every single way possible, than to live to be 90 years old and not really fulfill what I was born to do.”\n“I’d rather die at 30 years old, living for what I really believe… than to live to be 90 years old and not really fulfill what I was born to do.” For her work, she was named a “person of the year” by TIME magazine, along with other Ebola fighters. Meyler says watching so many people die has forever changed her.\n“I don’t want to get over it…. Remembering what it felt like and to see that national emergency, it motivates me and fuels me to fight to ensure it doesn’t happen again.”\nEleven years ago, Meyler packed her bags and set off for Liberia for a six-month internship with a charity.\n“I didn’t even know where Liberia was on a map. I had to Google it,” she says with a laugh.\nHer experience running a literacy program in a small, rural Liberian community was transformative. She was shocked to discover the lack of education and extreme poverty that children faced. She knew immediately that she had to stay.\n“There’s a saying that nobody chooses Liberia, that Liberia chooses you. I think part of it is, you come here and you see the amount of need the place has and the people are very warm and open and you realize you can make a big difference.”\nMeyer initially raised money for scholarships to send children to school. But she became so disenchanted with the existing school system, she decided to start her own. It’s called the More Than Me Academy , and it provides free education, meals and health care for girls in kindergarten through sixth grade.\nMeyler believes that improving the education system is the first step to preventing another such catastrophe. Last year she began working with Liberia’s minister of education to help overhaul the entire public school system. Her organization is one of seven private organizations that have taken over nearly 100 public schools in a pilot project.\nMeyler, who writes and performs poetry in her spare time, composed “Never Again” as a response to the Ebola epidemic.\n\nNever Again \nThank You, Thank You my Lord\nMen in moon suits shovel corpses like their rubble\nBodies piled high in the back of pick ups\nCrowds across the street keep their distance\nThe sounds of mourning screams are constant\nPeople lie like dogs on the street\nTheir cries for help go unanswered\nThe world’s afraid to come too close\nIn my rubber boots on bended knee\nThe stench of death was mixed with feces\nHis soft baby checks were against the dirt and dust\nThere was no ma for his hand to cup\nAlone\nIn a bath of his own blood\nHis big brown eyes looked at the world with love\nI asked him name\nHe could barely speak\nSoftly he tells me “I’m Charlie”\nHe reached for my arm\nBut I back up\nas much as I wanted to hold him\nthis is an enemy that preys on love\nIf only my songs\nCould hold his face\nEncircle him in a warm embrace\nThe soft notes down his back they’d trace\nThank you, thank you my Lord\nDeath tolls rising like the tide\nTension is more tangible than touch\nBodies are being buried in mass graves\nWhile experts sip coffees and lattes\nHave cocktail parties and all day debates\nOn the best strategizes and philosophies\nThat determine the fate of these communities\nThat they have never even frickin’ been to?\nSo I beg you now please help!\nBoots on the ground is what we need\nWe are out of water and PPE’s\nNo bleach, no beds, and no IV’s\nWages for employees??\nHospitals transmitting more disease\nA country that lacks complete capacity\nAnd there was Esther\nHairnet on her head\nIn a woman’s oversized flower dress\nAll the people around her sang\nWith arms stretched to the sky in praise\nThey were thanking God for their lives.\nThis was a survivor’s party\nExcept there was nothing about Esther that was happy\nShe survived Ebola, but when she woke up from a coma\nShe learned that her entire family didn’t.\nShe was about to be released\nExcept there was nobody there to get her\nIn a country without adoption and with no foster care system\nWhere will she go? And the world leaves her in the hands of the Liberian Government that is vividly broken as you freak out about an outbreak in\nAmerica that will never freakin’ happen\n“For God sake get a grip”\nSarah was stronger than any human being I’ve known\nI gave her two teddy bears and a telephone\nWe stood outside the Ebola treatment unit\nI looked into her eyes\nI told her she was going to be okay.\nI lied.\nShe walked down that dark hall\nAnd she never came back out\n“Are you sure? She seemed so strong?”\n“Sometimes they just drop dead”\nI couldn’t get the words out\nI just looked at her mother\nMy lips quivered\nI dropped my head and sobbed\nShe got the message\nAnd collapsed\nShe flung her arms in the air and shook\nno place to say her last goodbyes\nno “I love you baby”, no tears to wipe\nno hand to hold throughout the night\nSarah’s life is gone.\nThe world doesn’t stop, the debates go on, the blame goes on, the fight for attention the corruption.\nThis circus goes on.\nSarah’s life is gone. Gone, gone.\nWe let this go on. And now her precious life has slipped gone.\nI’m not okay and no one gets it\nNo one\nThese images won’t go away\nThey stain my mind and keep me awake\nI think about the little girl just dead on a bench\nor Sarah’s mothers face\nI sometimes weep thinking about what an inhumane, lonely death small Charlie had\nIt’s sad and dark but then I think about all of the survivors\nLike Esther. All she has lost but she has life\nI have life. And you have life.\nAnd we must use it to the max.\nThis will never be okay until we make sure it never happens again.\nSHARE ON FACEBOOK SHARE ON TWITTER SHARE VIA TEXT ebola Katie Meyler liberia MoreThanMe poetry PREVIOUS POST Read poems from the 7 countries affected by Trump’s immigration ban Are you aware of our comment policy?
