And that’s a disgrace too. \n“Films can do many things - they can entertain, they can terrify, they can take us to other worlds, they can make us laugh and they can tell us something about the world we live in. \n“In that real world it’s getting darker as we know. In the struggle that’s coming between the rich and the powerful, the wealth and the privilege, and the big corporations and the politicians that speak for them, on the one hand, and the rest of us on the other, the film makers know which side they are on. \n“And despite the glitz and the glamour of occasions like this, we’re with the people.” More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:39:10.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
