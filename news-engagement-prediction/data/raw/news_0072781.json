(Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTCU was a free throw away from upsetting West Virginia on Saturday and as a result could now be one free throw away from being an NCAA tournament team. The Horned Frogs were positioned to pick up a marquee victory that likely would have shifted them on the right side of the bubble and stood out as necessary eye candy for the selection committee come Selection Sunday. Instead, the 61-60 loss will stand as a crucial missed opportunity to boost the their résumé. \nDown by one with 10 seconds remaining, TCU's Alex Robinson had a chance to give the Horned Frogs the lead with two attempts at the charity stripe. Instead he split the free throws to knot the game at 60-all. Then West Virginia's Daxter Miles, as a result of a controversial foul call, split a pair of free throws himself and TCU's three-pointer at the horn missed. \n\"We didn't' get the break down the stretch,\" TCU coach Jamie Dixon said after the game. \"We've got to start making breaks.\" \nSimply put, the uneasy life of a bubble team means one possession — or bricked free-throw — could alter a team's postseason fate. TCU (17-12, 6-10) really needed that victory to put it over the top. Instead, there are just a few decent wins — against Illinois State and Iowa State — to like about the Horned Frogs' mediocre profile that features an RPI in the 50s and a non-conference strength of schedule in the 100s. Their two remaining regular-season games pit them against fellow bubble team Kansas State and the only dreadful team in the Big 12, Oklahoma. Lose either of those and they're done. Although, losing to WVU means a big win the Big 12 tournament is needed. Without it, there's just not enough there for Dixon's team. \nHere's a look at the rest of Saturday's winners and losers among bubble teams (This list will be updated throughout the night). WINNERS Michigan Wolverines \nMichigan Wolverines forward D.J. Wilson (5) celebrates after he makes a three point basket in the second half against the Purdue Boilermakers at Crisler Center. Michigan won 82-70. (Photo: Rick Osentoski, USA TODAY Sports) \nIf someone told Michigan players \"beat Purdue and you're in,\" they got that message on Saturday by emphatically rolling past the first-place Boilermakers to inch way on the right side of bubble and into the safety zone. They had decent wins before this — against SMU and Wisconsin. But this one will hold more weight. Sitting at the No. 10 line in bracketology before the win, the Wolverines will shoot up and are very secure for an at-large bid, although not 100% at this point. In road games against Nebraska and Northwestern next week, they probably need to win one of those to comfortably put on their dancing shoes. Vanderbilt Commodores \nVanderbilt steamrolled Mississippi State by 29 points to further enhance its credentials. The Commodores sport wins over Florida and Iowa State and are 6-5 against teams in the top-100. Then factor in the country's best non-conference strength of schedule. These are all features the committee will be impressed with to the point where a so-so record and loss to Missouri aren't that big of a deal. Ole Miss Rebels \nOle Miss (18-11, 9-7) has the most work to do of SEC bubble teams because it hasn't really beaten anyone. Its best win is ... Vanderbilt. And the RPI is in the high 60s. So this victory was surely necessary, but it won't push them in yet. Wins this next week against Alabama (March 1) and South Carolina (March 4) could do that. Providence Friars \nProvidence got the best of Marquette in a bubble showdown. (Photo: Stew Milne, USA TODAY Sports) \nIn a clash between two bubble teams fighting for a bid, Providence out-dueled Marquette, 73-69. The Friars (18-11, 8-8) now has four consecutive wins, all against likely NCAA tournament teams. This team has a really good chunk of notable wins, Butler and Creighton being the biggest, but it also owns some absolutely horrendous losses to St. John's Boston College and DePaul. Wichita State Shockers \nA weak bubble is the Shockers' best friend this season, as their at-large chances more so depend upon what bottom-of-the-pack ACC and Big 12 bubble teams do than what they've been doing on the hardwood — which has been drubbing opponents. On Saturday, the Shockers took down Missouri State by 19 points to claim a share of the Missouri Valley Conference title with Illinois State. At 27-4 and no bad losses, it's going to be tough for the selection committee to put a team six games below .500 ahead of Wichita in the tourney field, even with a lack of a marquee wins for the Shockers. Illinois State Redbirds \nThe Redbirds have been winning in less dominating fashion than their MVC rival but Saturday's 21-point road win against Northern Iowa, a team that had won nine of 12, was pretty impressive. It clinched them a share of the Valley regular season title, which of course doesn't mean much to the selection committee. The weak bubble could also pave way for Illinois State (25-5, 17-1) to reach the Dance if it were to lose to Wichita State in the Arch Madness final in St. Louis. Any other loss would likely be too staining due to a down year in the Valley (more than half the league is outside the RPI top-100). The Redbirds' RPI could sneak in the low 20s by season's end, making that stat very hard to ignore. The only thing worse about their résumé as compared to Wichita is two bad losses outside the top-100 to Tulsa and Murray State. How the committee values Wichita State, No. 25 in the coaches poll this week, will matter for Illinois State because it's rare that a team with bad losses and no real marquee victory make the cut. Plus, ISU's ugly loss to the Shockers came without one of its best players, MiKyle McIntosh. LOSERS Pittsburgh Panthers \nThe Panthers needed this one, against a likely NCAA tournament No. 1 seed, but ultimately fell to North Carolina, 85-67. Missed opportunity, but the only thing that really does for Pitt's resume is make the loss department look even uglier. The Panthers are 4-12 in the ACC, and yet, they're not completely out of the mix. Credit a horrendous bubble field and the strength of the ACC. What Pitt has that teams like Illinois State and Wichita State don't have are wins against Florida State, Virginia and Maryland to go along with a top-10 strength of schedule. Don't let the 15-14 record deceive you. \nClemson Tigers guard Shelton Mitchell (4) reacts during the second half against the Florida State Seminoles at Littlejohn Coliseum. Seminoles won 76-74. (Photo: Joshua S. Kelly, USA TODAY Sports) Clemson Tigers \nAlso 4-12 in the ACC is Clemson. The Tigers were right there, and poised to get a signature victory against Florida State, but fell short in a 76-74 decision. That loss drops Clemson to 14-14 on the season and takes away a chance for them to get an eye-popping win tacked onto their underwhelming credentials which feature wins against the best win against South Carolina. That gets negated by resume-staining loss to Oklahoma. Clemson's last two regular-season games are against bottom-feeders Boston College and N.C. State. They're likely already out barring a late surge, and if they lose either of those two games their at-large hopes are all but eliminated. Tennessee Volunteers \nThe Volunteers (15-14, 7-9) were already reeling, and then lost by 27 points to South Carolina on Saturday. Tennessee is one of the SEC's many weak bubble teams and losing to fellow borderline squad Vanderbilt earlier in the week really hurts its tournament cause. With a bevy of losses — and a chunk of them to other SEC bubble foes — there's only so much a top-10 strength of schedule can do, especially considering Vanderbilt's SoS is top-five. Marquette Golden Eagles \nSaturday's loss to fellow bubble team hurts Marquette quite a bit, especially since it's trying to pretend its non-conference strength of schedule in the 230s doesn't exist. Wins agains Villanova, Creighton and Xavier are tough to ignore. So is a loss to St. John's and an RPI of 69. \nNCAA TOURNAMENT BUBBLE TEAMS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:48:47.377+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
