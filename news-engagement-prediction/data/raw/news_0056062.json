She also champions the estate where all this unfolded, challenging claims it was — or is — a ‘real life Beirut’. That’s no easy task, however. It transpires other residents on the estate have been offering guided tours of the streets where the ‘famous’ Shannon Matthews lived, for £30 a pop. HAUNTED AND UNABLE TO FORGIVE The doubting friend, Natalie Brown THE BOYFRIEND WHO HAD TO FLEE VIGILANTES 5 TIMES The mother’s boyfriend, Craig Meehan Craig Meehan, Karen’s seemingly hapless young partner No one could have predicted the repercussions the case would have on Craig Meehan, Karen’s seemingly hapless young partner. While Craig was not deemed involved in either the abduction plot or the elaborate cover story, the ensuing investigation tore his life apart, nonetheless. Police examined computers at the house and found images of child porn on his. He was then convicted of possession of child porno-graphy and sentenced to 20 weeks’ imprisonment —although he was released on the same day as he had spent longer on remand. Now 30, he lives the same sort of miserable existence as Karen. He, too, is living under a new name, but it’s believed he has moved five times.His first move took him to Keighley in West Yorkshire, but after being attacked, he tried another address, but horrified locals there drove him out. While it may seem like he is free to live a normal life (last weekend he was pictured shopping for groceries), it’s not an easy one. A report this week claimed he’d been set on by three men as publicity for the TV series grew. They attacked him near a supermarket and one called him a ‘pervert’. Natalie Brown lived next door to Karen Matthews, considered herself a close friend and was first to offer support after Shannon went missing. Natalie threw open the doors of her own home when Karen needed somewhere to stay while police were searching her property, and treated Karen’s other children as her own. Yet she was the first of the inner circle to express doubts about Karen’s odd behaviour — and her growing sense that something was very wrong led to her joining Julie in a confrontation that prompted Karen’s confession. While Julie still professes friendship, however, Natalie cannot forgive her former friend. She moved away from the estate in the immediate aftermath of the case and is still haunted by the events. Her doubts started, she said this week, when Karen did the very first interview with reporters outside her house. ‘I was there when the family liaison officer told her not to do the interview until they had as much information as they could gather. It was owing to previous cases when a child has gone missing and it could put their life in danger. ‘But Karen did the interview. To me, as a mum, why would you do that when you’ve been told it could put your child’s life at risk?’ STILL MISSING THEIR GRANDDAUGHTER The heartbroken grandparents The fact Shannon’s grandparents keep their treasured photos of her in a biscuit tin, carefully out of sight, speaks volumes about the gaping hole left in their lives. June and Gordon Matthews say it is simply too painful to see the pictures every day. Although the pair had a fractured relationship with their daughter (they did not approve of her lifestyle and were horrified by her parenting approach, even before the kidnap), they stepped into the breach early in Shannon’s life, helping to raise their granddaughter. Her disappearance, and the subsequent discovery that their own daughter was behind it, shattered them. ‘What Karen did to Shannon is unforgivable,’ Gordon says. ‘That poor mite. That poor girl. And what she put us through almost killed us. I can’t forgive her. She is dead to me.’ Gordon is not a well man. He has lost almost 3 stone and been in and out of hospital with anxiety-related issues, something his wife blames on the trauma of the past nine years. Sian Brooke as Natalie Brown and Siobhan Finneran as DC Christine Freeman in The Moorside DAD WHOSE WORLD WAS SHATTERED Shannon’s father, Leon Rose Shannon’s father, Leon Rose pictured leaving Dewsbury Court, Yorkshire in 2008 One of the most upsetting moments in the drama came when police find Shannon had scrawled on her bedroom wall that she wanted to live with her Dad. Her father, Leon Rose, had been in a new relationship since 1998, but Shannon was a regular visitor to the Huddersfield home he shared with partner Tracey Goldsmith and their two children. ‘Shannon would stop over every other week,’ Tracey told us. ‘He thought the world of her.’ When Shannon was reported missing, Leon drove to Dewsbury each day to help in the search, initially believing she had run away. Tracey, however, had her suspicions. ‘Things didn’t add up. Karen was doing TV appearances, doing appeals and smirking. She was eating in front of the cameras. We couldn’t eat because we were sick to the stomach. We felt we were in a horrible dream.’ She says Leon was ‘over the moon’ when Shannon was found. ‘It was like he had won the lottery, but it was better than money. He had his daughter back.’ Then the truth emerged — shattering the happy ending. Leon was devastated. His ex-partner claims they split in 2008 and ‘it was the stress (over Shannon) that caused the break up. What Karen did led us to split up’. Leon, who now works as a photographer, remarried in 2014. THE PARTNER IN CRIME WHO VANISHED The accomplice, Michael Donovan Michael Donovan, the uncle of Karen’s boyfriend Craig Meehan, was Matthews’s co-conspirator. Guilty of kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice, he was also sentenced to eight years in prison, but had already been released by the time Karen got out of jail. Although Karen has always been presented as the main perpetrator, Donovan’s role was vital. It was in his home, trapped and drugged under a divan bed, that Shannon was found. Born Paul Drake, he changed his name to Michael Donovan after a character in Eighties sci-fi TV series V. Michael Donovan, the uncle of Karen’s boyfriend Craig Meehan, was Matthews’s co-conspirator Neighbours called him a ‘weirdo’ and even his sister branded him a fantasist. He had been charged with abducting his eldest daughter prior to Shannon’s kidnap but the case was dropped. His IQ is so low that he is classed as mentally impaired. When he was jailed, there were fears Donovan would take his own life andwas moved to a suicide watch unit at Wakefield Prison. He was also assaulted and at one point refused to eat, dropping to 8st. In 2012, while on parole, his actions were called into question again when he was spotted acting suspiciously while sitting on a bench in Leeds. He was returned to prison for a period, and it’s not know what happened to him after that. Of all the key players, he alone has slid out of public view. NOT FORGETTING POOR SHANNON The victim, Shannon Matthews Ironically, we know least about what’s become of Shannon, the girl at the centre of this astonishing saga. She never did come home, but was placed with a new family. She is 18 now and was not consulted on the drama about her life. Did she watch it, though? That is the most chilling question of all.
