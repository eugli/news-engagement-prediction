He has been removed from the primary membership of the party,” Sasikala said in a statement. He was replaced by former minister and Gopichettipalayam MLA K A Sengottaiyan. \n\nSasikala requested the cadre to not have any truck with the leader. The statement said Sengottaiyan was appointed as organising secretary of the party only last week. \n\nReacting to his ‘expulsion’ from the party, Madhusudanan told TOI: “She cannot expel me as I have already expelled her from the party.” \n\n“The bylaws framed by our founder M G Ramachandran always wanted a person to be elected general secretary only by cadre of the party. By that scale, the election of Sasikala is null and void and therefore she is not the party’s general secretary,” said Madhusudanan. \n\nThe MGR loyalist on Thursday visited caretaker chief minister O Panneerselvam’s Greenways residence and offered support. Panneerselvam described him as “permanent general secretary of the party.” \n\nHe accompanied OPS to Raj Bhavan in the evening to appraise the “prevailing situation” in the state. Incidentally, Madhusoodanan was one of the leaders who first visited Sasikala to persuade her to take over the mantle of general secretary and carry forward Jayalalithaa’s legacy. \n\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T13:56:42.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
