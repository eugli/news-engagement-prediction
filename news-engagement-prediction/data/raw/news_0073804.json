The new models come with a refreshed design that features 2.5D curved Gorilla Glass 5, an all-metal backplate with a sandblasted finish and Huawei's hyper-diamond cut on the edges. Both devices come in a range of colors including new green and blue options.\nWith a dual-camera that combines a 12MP color sensor with a 20MP monochrome chip the specification of the Leica-designed camera in the Huawei P10 is the same as in the Mate 9. Both lenses have an F2.2 aperture and the color variant also features optical image stabilization. As before, color and monochrome image information is combined for better image detail, higher dynamic range and lower noise levels in the Huawei P10 images. There is also a laser-assisted autofocus, two-tone LED flash and 4K video recording.\nNew on the camera is the 'Leica-style' portrait mode that uses 3D face detection and applies a combination of fake bokeh and adjustable illumination and 'beautification' effects to your portrait subjects. It works on both the main camera and the 8MP front camera that comes with an F1.9 aperture. The front camera can also automatically adjust the framing for individual or group selfies.\nImages can be viewed and framed on a 5.1\" IPS display with 1080p resolution and the Android 7.0 operating system is powered by Huawei's HiSilicon Kirin 960 octa-core chipset and 4GB of RAM. 64GB of internal storage can be expanded via a microSD slot. Compared to the P9 the battery size has increased from 3,000 to 3,200 mAh and fast charging is supported as well. The Huawei P10 will launch in March in Europe and many other regions at 649 Euros (approximately $685). Unfortunately US comsumer will have to wait a little longer for the new device.\nThe P10 Plus comes with a very similar design to the P10 but ups the display specification to 5.5\" and Quad-HD resolution. Like the P10 it is powered by the Kirin 960 chip, but in addition to the 4GB RAM/64GB storage version you can opt for a 6GB/128GB variant. In addition the P10 plus comes with slightly faster F1.8 apertures in the lenses of the dual-camera and a larger 3,750 mAh battery. The 64GB option will be priced at 699 Euros ($740), the 128GB model will set you back 799 Euros ($845).\n\nHuawei P10 key specifictions: Leica-branded dual-camera with 12MP color and 20MP monochrome sensors F2.2 aperture OIS on the color sensor 27mm equivalent focal length On-sensor phase detection and laser-assisted AF Daal-tone LED flash 4K video 8MP front camera with F1.9 aperture Manual camera control 5.1\" IPS display with 1080p resolution Android 7.0 HiSilicon Kirin 960 octa-core chipset 4GB RAM and 64GB storage microSD support up to 256GB 3200 mAh battery Stereo speakers Fingerprint reader", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:24:11.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
