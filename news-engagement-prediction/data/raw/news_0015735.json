(ABC Western Queensland: Andrea Crothers) Bright future for college \nAs the college celebrates its 50th anniversary, board chairman Richard Pietsch said it was a significant milestone for the institution. \n\"Fifty years of doing anything and still being operating is great,\" Mr Pietsch said. \n\"It's cause for real celebration that we're still up and running, and we're successfully training students.\" \nMr Pietsch said the future was bright for the college, particularly with the prospect of large numbers of sheep returning to western Queensland . \n\"It's a wonderful time to be in agriculture,\" he said. \n\"We're now actually making real money and we're being able to put that back into infrastructure and all sorts of things as producers, and also into the training of people we use and need in industry.\" Photo: New students Laura Greenfield, of Marree, South Australia, and Chelsea Kerr, of Kingaroy, on their first day of college. (ABC Western Queensland: Andrea Crothers) New students start learning \nThis week the college once again welcomed students from across the country for the start of the college year. \nLaura Greenfield made the 1,500-kilometre trek from Marree in South Australia to study a certificate III in horse breeding and training. \nShe was attracted by the opportunities for working with horses and all the facilities the college provided. \nChelsea Kerr, from Kingaroy, is one of many students starting one of the college's most recent courses, the Northern Beef Industries Program. \nMs Kerr said the hands-on approach at the college suited her learning. \n\"It's a prac-based course and it gives you the skills you'll need to go off on a station or pursue a career in the ag industry,\" she said. \nWith the historic year in the college's history now underway, Ms Champion said it was just what the founders would have hoped for. \n\"These young people that we're educating now, as we did back then, is to get on the big stations and make them work ready,\" she said. \n\"I think my dad, his brother Lloyd, and John Hoist-Lewis, I think they'd be incredibly proud.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:31:49.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
