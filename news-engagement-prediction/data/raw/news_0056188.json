Feb 22, 2017 1:17 PM \nSo glad my team isn’t overpaying for a mediocre QB Feb 22, 2017 1:18 PM \nMAKE IT HAPPEN LYNCH! Let’s get a QB that knows the system DAY one. deneb1973 says: Feb 22, 2017 1:20 PM \nAnd go with Colt McCoy and Nate Sudfeld at QB? Those are the in house options so this is silly speculation. Gruden’s offense takes time (1-2 years) to learn so a new QB would destroy the 2017 season and possibly the 2018 season dooming Gruden and his staff (not to mention the front office). Where are you going to find an upgrade to Cousins? Jay Cutler? One of the big three backups (Glennon, Garoppolo, McCarren)? Taylor if the Bills cut him loose? Would Dan Snyder absorb the negative fan reaction if the team goes 5 and 11 next year? We will know the answer shortly. sidepull says: Feb 22, 2017 1:21 PM \nWhat a hot mess. I cant wait until the real story comes out. If the Redskins lose the only viable QB they had in years, cannot sign him to a LTD, its pretty poor job by the management. Somebody should get fired over this, yet maybe the guy whose responsible cant be fired. Aw what the the heck, fire Bruce Allen just on principal. \nOr….they are all on the same page and dont think Cousins is worth what hes asking. In either case, fire Bruce Allen. weepingjebus says: Feb 22, 2017 1:23 PM \nThe real question is whether Kaepernick will accept a large sub sandwich, or half one plus a spot to sleep out of the rain. lonespeed says: Feb 22, 2017 1:23 PM \nWouldn’t this set Washington back at least two years? It looks like they may not keep Jackson, Garçon, or Cousins? Not saying long term it might not work out, but going to be a rough couple years for ‘skin fans with no guarantees they’ll get better. starrfavrerodgers says: Feb 22, 2017 1:27 PM \nThe Redskins are on the bubble of playoff teams in recent years, and seem to be putting pieces in place for the future. So with no viable in-house replacement, why on earth would they deal away Cousins? Even if they believe in a QB at #2 in this draft, that still sets trajectory of their ascension back considerably by having to teach your system to your most important player. Feb 22, 2017 1:28 PM \nSwap 6th round picks. cryeaglescry2020 says: Feb 22, 2017 1:29 PM \nHey PFT, how come no mention of the Cousins shoving the volunteer ref at a charity flag football game story? Showed his 1st class jerk true colors there jackedupboonie says: Feb 22, 2017 1:38 PM \nRedskins should find a trade partner, give Bears a 6th for Cutler, and let Mclouglan find his next young QB star. Cousins is Dave Krieg. Serviceable , but low ceiling. karlcuba says: Feb 22, 2017 1:41 PM \nAbsurd suggestion. \nThe difference in value between the 2nd pick and the 17th is worth the sixth overall pick, throw in their second and it’s worth the 3rd overall pick. \nFor right to pay $25 million a year to a qb who’ll turn 29 before the season starts. \nI think I’ll just take Trubisky, he’s probably going to be much better, he will be cheaper and the niners get to keep their second round pick. theimmaculatedeception says: Feb 22, 2017 1:42 PM \nScott McLoughan is most likely in the bottle according to published reports. Do any of us trust him to pull off any portion of the above scenario? Leave a Reply \nYou must be logged in to leave a comment. Not a member? Register now!
