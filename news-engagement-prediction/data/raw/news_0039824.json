(AP Photo) \nWASHINGTON • At one point in a contentious news conference Thursday, President Donald Trump claimed that his electoral victory was larger than that of any president since Ronald Reagan. \nThat is false. In five of the seven elections before Trump’s, the winner got more electoral votes than Trump did. \nCalled on the misstatement later in the news conference, the president said: “Well, I don’t know, I was given that information. ... But it was a very substantial victory. Do you agree with that?” \nThe answer was illustrative for two reasons: \nFirst, facts count. In an era when Trump has made “fake news” an attack line, getting the facts right should be a minimal expectation of all officeholders, including the president. \nSecond, the exchange illustrates Trump’s view of his governing mandate. He did not win the popular vote in November, but he still believes his victory was “very substantial.” \nThat explains why Trump has had trouble getting his cabinet approved, why his immigration executive action is getting rejected in federal court, and why protesters are showing up at Republican town halls months after the election. \nTrump is governing as if he had a “very substantial” Reagan-like mandate, when in truth he leads a very divided country, as he acknowledged on Thursday. \nHe has responded with a fast and furious first month. \n“I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done,” Trump said. \nThat statement would get little opposition from anyone, but it carries widely divergent meanings. \nTrump has put forth cabinet nominees so controversial that some Republicans are having trouble supporting them. Nervous Republicans sank Andy Puzder , a former St. Louis lawyer and Washington University law graduate, who withdrew Wednesday as labor secretary nominee. \nAnd by Trump’s own admission, former national security adviser Michael Flynn sunk himself by not being truthful with Vice President Mike Pence about a conversation with the Russian ambassador. \nAverage Americans may have looked at Thursday’s 75-minute news conference and saw what Trump means by going to war with the media. He was combative, playing defense as well as offense, and at times self-contradictory. \nHe talked more about the November election than promised Republican tax and health care reform plans. He mentioned Hillary Clinton 11 times. \nHe acknowledged the accuracy of the leaked conversation that helped doom Flynn, while simultaneously labeling the reporting of those conversations “fake news.” \n“You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real,” Trump said. “The news is fake because so much of the news is fake.” \nHe said questions about his potential Russian connections are “a ruse,” even though Republican-led committees in Congress are probing them. He again declared he had no loans and no business in Russia. \n“You tell us there is nothing to worry about,” Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told CNN. “Please show us your tax returns. We will know what the truth is.” \nAverage Americans watching may wonder why the combatants were not talking about their concerns: jobs, what replaces a scuttled Obamacare, the deficit, how the divide over illegal immigration can be bridged. \nHis war with the media is crowding out other stories Trump could be telling. \nMany of his supporters like that he wants to build a border wall. While talking heads on TV were using terms such as “unhinged” to describe the president, radio host Rush Limbaugh described it as “one of the most effective press conferences I’ve ever seen” in rallying Trump’s political base. \nEven as the Flynn and immigration controversies swirled, the Republican Congress has passed measure after measure fulfilling Trump’s promise to peel back regulations he says hurt business. \nOver the past month, they’ve voted to roll back former President Barack Obama’s regulations on mining runoff, oil and gas companies’ financial disclosures, pay discrimination among federal contractors and expanded background checks for some Social Security recipients who want to buy guns. \nBefore the inauguration last month, Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., described Trump’s style in scientific terms. \n“You are trying to create something where you drop a different element into that formula [and] you get a different result,” Blunt said. “I think he brings that synergistic impact to what we do here. People want to see change. I think he is more likely to be an agent of that change than anybody else.” \nNow, after a first month in which one top adviser has resigned, a cabinet nominee has withdrawn, questions of Russian influence persist, and sweeping plans on taxes and health care are unclear, the question is what degree of “synergistic impact” Blunt and his Republican colleagues on Capitol Hill will appreciate, and for how long.
