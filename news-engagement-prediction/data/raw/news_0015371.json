But the official said that the administration doesn’t view Russia as the same existential threat that the Soviet Union posed to the U.S. during the Cold War and that Mr. Trump was committed to constraining Iran. \nTRUMP SAYS PENCE TO LEAD VOTER REGISTRATION FRAUD PROBE, LEAVES DOOR OPEN ON IRAN DEAL FUTURE \nSuch a strategy doesn’t entirely explain the mixed signals Mr. Trump and his circle have sent regarding Moscow, which have unnerved U.S. allies and caught Republican leaders in Congress off guard. \nMr. Trump himself spoke again about wanting to mend relations with Mr. Putin in an interview that aired before Sunday’s Super Bowl, saying “it’s better to get along with Russia than not.” After Fox News host Bill O’Reilly said Mr. Putin was a “killer,” the president responded: “What, you think our country’s so innocent?” \nBut those involved in the latest policy discussions argue there is a specific focus on trying to drive a wedge between Russia and Iran. \nThe Kremlin has said it aims to mend ties with the U.S. under the Trump administration but in recent months has also signaled its intent to continue to build on its cooperation with Iran. \nMoscow and Tehran have formed a tight military alliance in Syria in recent years. The Kremlin is a major supplier of weapons systems and nuclear equipment to Iran.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:12:58.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
