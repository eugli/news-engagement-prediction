Bears fans knew it was over halfway through this year, the national media now knows its official with the story being leaked that Ryan Pace is actively trying to trade him. We can talk forever about what went wrong. Obviously Jay Cutler didn’t turn out to be the guy we all wanted him to be when the trade was made with Denver in 2009. Inconsistent play, turnovers, injuries, you name it. I’ve also never been the blame Cutler for everything guy. This organization from top to bottom has been a joke since the Super Bowl against the Colts. The Offense was ignored for years, then when the team tried to invest in skill players the Defense got old overnight. They’ve consistently missed on draft picks and hired the wrong people, that’s not Jay Cutler’s fault and to blame him for that is foolish. He was a part of the problem but he wasn’t the biggest problem by any stretch and I’ve always thought he got an unfair percentage of the blame. Such is life as an NFL Quarterback. The one thing I will always stand up for him for though is his toughness. Dude got his ass kicked year in and year out with bad offensive lines and worse Offensive Coordinators. One game that will always stick out to me is that 2011 game in New Orleans when Cutler got sacked over and over again. Mike Martz calling 7 step drops with Chris Williams, J’Marcus Webb, and Gabe Carimi protecting Cutler. OC calling bad plays with a bad line and Cutler stood in there and got the snot beat out of him. That was a large part of the Cutler era. \n\n\nWhich leads me to the point of this blog. I have no insider information, I haven’t talked to Cutler in over 2 and a half years now so I have no idea what he’s thinking. But from the outside looking in, it wouldn’t shock me if he retired. At this point what is left? Go get your ass kicked some more with the Jets or the Browns? He’s made his money, he’s played at the highest level for a lot of years, unless the perfect situation comes along, a team that is ready to win now, why keep going? I know the Bears as a formality will say they’re trying to trade him but we all know it will end up in Ryan Pace cutting him and I wouldn’t be shocked if that’s it. No goodbye or see ya later. Just poof, 6 is gone from football. I’ll probably be wrong because I have a knack for having awful predictions but I haven’t seen anyone throw this out there so there it is. Now hopefully the Bears can find their franchise quarterback, they’ve only been looking for that guy for 20+ years now.
