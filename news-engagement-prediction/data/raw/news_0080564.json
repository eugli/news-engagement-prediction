He remained, to those who only had eyes for English soccer, a curiously and uniquely continental phenomenon. His poor record against English clubs in the Champions League — or, a far lower bar, on his occasional sallies against the English national team — was always trotted out as the case for the prosecution. Ibrahimovic scored goals, great avalanches of goals, against lesser teams in lesser leagues, but always for sides on which — as the former Manchester United and England star Paul Scholes once put it — it was “easy” to score. \nAdvertisement   His travails against English defenses were seen as proof that, across the Channel, he would ultimately amount to little beyond ordinary. By extension, his sustained success in the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and France simply served as proof of the superiority of the Premier League. Ibrahimovic might have given the criticism short shrift in public, but in private, he resented it. In his autobiography, “I Am Zlatan,” he described using the haughty dismissal of the English news media as a motivational tool before playing — and scoring, twice — for Barcelona against Arsenal in 2010. \nAdvertisement   Two years later, as he was deluged with praise after scoring four goals, the final one extraordinary, for Sweden against England in a friendly in Stockholm, he suggested that “that’s the way it is with the English: If you score against them, you’re a good player. If you don’t, you’re not.” Sweden vs England 4-2, Official Goals and Highlights | FATV 14/11/12 Video by England Football Official In hindsight, those two games acted as significant staging posts in Ibrahimovic’s relationship with England. After a decade of doubt, a country was suddenly converted. \nAdvertisement   “Last night, the world woke up to the mighty Zlatan,” the former Liverpool midfielder and omnipresent talking head Jamie Redknapp wrote after the latter match. The world, of course, had been alert to Ibrahimovic’s ability for quite some time because of all those goals and trophies. Only in Britain had eyes, and minds, been closed. \nAdvertisement What has happened in the seven months since he disembarked at Manchester United has, then, seemed to be an attempt to make up for lost time, conducted with all the ardor of a late-in-life romance between star-crossed lovers. \nAdvertisement   Ibrahimovic has reveled in his chance to show the Premier League precisely what it was overlooking: 26 goals in 38 games under Manager José Mourinho, including winning goals in the Community Shield and, on Sunday at Wembley, the E.F.L. Cup, the first major trophy of the season. HIGHLIGHTS: Manchester United 3-2 Southampton (EFL Cup Final 2017) Video by Southampton FC At 35, he has played more minutes than many of his far younger teammates. As much as his efficacy in front of the goal, and the characteristic imagination in his play, his undimmed appetite for the battle has impressed. \nAdvertisement   On match day at Old Trafford, jerseys bearing his name and number dominate the stands. Behind the scenes, he has relished working with Mourinho again, and he has forged a firm friendship with his teammate Henrikh Mkhitaryan, often dining with him, and Paul Pogba, in the city. That trace of English exceptionalism has not been absent from all of the tributes that have flowed in his direction — the former Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard said in December that Ibrahimovic is a “world-class player, and now he is proving it week in, week out” — but that England has fallen, and fallen hard, for its Swedish paramour is beyond doubt.
