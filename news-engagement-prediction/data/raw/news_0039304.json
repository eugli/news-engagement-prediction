Paul Pogba shows brotherly love after Florentin is forced off injured \nThe France international has been inconsistent in his second season at Old Trafford, but showed what he’s capable of in his first year when he finished as top scorer on 17 goals. \nUnited will now hope the 21-year-old can rediscover that form after a strong return to the first-team fold against Watford at the weekend, when he scored one and set up the other in a 2-0 win. Anthony Martial has 7 goals so far this season (Picture: Getty) \nScholes believes confidence is key for Martial, and once he gets going he could be the consistent source of goals the Red Devils need. \n‘We’ve seen that he’s capable of scoring goals, beating players, but we’re not seeing it enough,’ Scholes told BT Sport. \n‘He’s still a young player, we have to remember that and when you look at wide players they’re always the most inconsistent on the pitch anyway.
