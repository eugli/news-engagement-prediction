Many Republicans have been urged by town hall attendees to vote in favour of such an investigation.\n\"Unless the resolution is reported by the committee within 14 legislative days, either favorably, unfavorably or without recommendation, then it can be brought up on the House floor immediately thereafter, so the committee plans to address this resolution next week,\" said one House Judiciary Committee aide in a statement to Politico. \nThe panel vote on Tuesday has been planned for a busy news day, just hours before President Trump will give his first address to Congress, effectively burying the vote among a sea of headlines.\nGraphiq Blocking the resolution next week might be tough for certain Judiciary Committee Republicans. One of them is Jason Chaffetz, the Chairman of the committee on oversight and government reform, who has been criticised for not investigating Mr Trump.\nHe has only pursued investigations against Counselor to the President, Kellyanne Conway, for pitching Ivanka Trump’s brand during a television interview.\nHe is instead focused on looking into media leaks about Mr Trump's ties to Russia, as opposed to the President's alleged ties themselves.\nThe vote will come shortly after a wave of town halls which were flooded with angry, frustrated voters, who shouted down politicians like Mr Chaffetz, Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn and Senator Tom Cotton.\nRead more Donald Trump faces more ethics questions after China trademark win Trump’s latest Twitter battle fuels conflict of interest concerns House Oversight Committee ‘unlikely’ to investigate Trump The President insisted the protests were organised by \"thugs and liberal activists\".\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said some people were \"clearly upset\" but added that there was a \"bit of professional, manufactured base in there\".\nThe President has also been accused of corruption as his real estate empire has not been liquidated and put into a blind trust.\nInstead, his two sons are running the business and he retains branding rights and royalties for existing business which he will return to after the Presidency.\nHe has still not released his tax returns, and Ms Conway said in a recent interview that he had no plans to do so because he won the election.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:15:49.305+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
