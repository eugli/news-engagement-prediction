The other two men were described as being of slim build. \nThey were all wearing dark shorts. \nPolice are urging the men to return the dog to the nearest police station. \nSocial media has gone into overdrive in an attempt to locate the dog. \n“That’s like stealing a wee baby, pugs are literally like little babies, they’re very loyal to their owner, I couldn’t even leave mine to go into a shop or she would cry. Poor pug will be so upset,” one woman said. \nPhotos of the dog have already been shared hundreds of times on social media in an attempt to help return the dog to its owner. \nPolice said they will address the media regarding the theft at 10am", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:34:50.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
