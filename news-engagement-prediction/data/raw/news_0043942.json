Perhaps because it is technically demanding, it seems to attract more than its fair share of talented musicians too. Alto saxophonist Glen Manby is a case in point. Fully at home in the idiom, with a polished technique and mature tone, he’s an eloquent player. Normally based in Cardiff, he appears here with four of Britain’s A-team: trumpeter Steve Waterman , pianist Leon Greening, bassist Adam King and drummer Matt Home. Most of the 10 numbers are Manby originals, plus pieces by Wayne Shorter , Quincy Jones et al. All round, it’s a stylish session, with a good variety of mood and tempo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:07:44.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
