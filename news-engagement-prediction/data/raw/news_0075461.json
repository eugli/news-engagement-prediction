It’s a very cool thing. \n“Richard got in touch about a month ago and mentioned he had something in mind. I’m shooting some time in March.” Andrew as Mark, who's hopelessly in love with Keira Knightley's Juliet (Photo: Universal Studios) Andrew Lincoln and Keira Knightley in the famous scene from the film (Photo: Rex Features) \nOther stars of the original film involved in the new project include Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Rowan Atkinson, Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. \nComic Relief Actually will be a ten minute short for Red Nose Day, and will air on BBC One as part of their Comic Relief coverage on 24 March. \nThe short film will revisit the characters from the much-loved British movie and Richard had a great time working on the script. \n\"Over the years I've enjoyed doing Red Nose Day specials of TV things I've worked on - Blackadder, The Vicar of Dibley and Mr Bean. \n\"It seemed like a fun idea this year to do a special sketch based one of my films, since Red Nose Day is now in both the UK and America.

Who has aged best? - I guess that's the big question... or is it so obviously Liam?\" \nSadly Emma Thompson is one of the stars who won’t be returning - and it’s because she can’t face filming without her on-screen partner, Alan Rickman, who died last year. \n\"Richard wrote me out and said, 'Darling we can't write anything for you because of Alan', and I said, 'no of course, it would be sad, too sad,’” Emma told PA.
