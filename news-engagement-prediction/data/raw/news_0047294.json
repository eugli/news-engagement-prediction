Racist man spat in baby's face and shouted 'white people shouldn't breed' \nBut it’s so much of a steal investors might be able to grab a £1 million profit – with the two-bed apartment offering an en-suite bathroom and cellar – and even has world renowned restaurant Claridge’s on its doorstep. \nEstate agent Wetherells says it’s the ‘cheapest flat currently for sale in posh Mayfair and the West End.’ SWNS \nThe average two-bed property in the area costs £2.8 million. \nThe catch? The lease expires in 12 years, and it’ll cost another £150,000 to extend it. SWNS \nBut even that isn’t too bad – it works out at £866 per week over the life of the lease in an area where renting a similar property costs £1,300 per week. \nPeter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell Estate Agents, says it could be worth between £1.8 and £2 million – netting the buyer a potential £1 million pre-tax profit. \nMr Wetherell said: “This flat has forced me to ‘eat my words’ and retract a bold claim I made last year. SWNS \n‘We forecast the extinction of the sub-£1 million flat in Mayfair. Well this flat clearly proves that mega-bargains can be snapped up in Mayfair. We expect it to sell extremely quickly.’ \n‘This apartment would be perfect for a student – the spare room could be for a colleague on their course or for family who visit them.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:10:41.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
