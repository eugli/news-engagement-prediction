Shortly before taking office, he vigorously criticized the Obama administration for not vetoing a United Nations Security Council measure condemning settlements. \nBut in a statement Thursday, the White House said, \"While we don't believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal.\" \nThe White House said the administration \"has not taken an official position on settlement activity\" and the president would discuss the issue with Netanyahu when he travels to Washington later this month. The two leaders are scheduled to meet at the White House on Feb. 15. \nThe U.S. statement came hours after Netanyahu vowed to establish the first new West Bank settlement in over two decades \"as soon as possible,\" promising to make up for the court-ordered demolition of an illegal settler outpost. It was his latest step to expand Israeli settlement construction in the wake of Trump's inauguration. \nNetanyahu repeatedly clashed with President Barack Obama during the Democrat's eight years in office, and Trump has vowed to be a better partner for Israel. But he's already appeared to slow his promises to move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem -- a promise often made by presidential candidates, but never carried out in office because of fears the move would inflame tensions in the region. \nNewly sworn-in Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke by phone Thursday with Netanyahu. \nThe prime minister's vow to establish new West Bank settlements came as Israeli security forces were completing the evacuation of Amona, where they broke into a synagogue to remove dozens of Israeli protesters who had barricaded themselves inside. \nNetanyahu's pro-settler government had unsuccessfully tried to block the evacuation of Amona, but Israel's Supreme Court rejected all appeals after determining the outpost was built illegally two decades ago on private Palestinian land. \nSpeaking at a ceremony in the West Bank settlement of Ariel, Netanyahu expressed \"great pain\" over the removal of Amona. \nAccording to the Israeli anti-settlement watchdog Peace Now, Israel has not officially broken ground on a new settlement since 1992. \nSince that time, however, it has greatly expanded its existing settlements and allowed dozens of unauthorized outposts to sprout up, in some cases subsequently legalizing them. In all, some 400,000 Israelis now live in West Bank settlements, in addition to 200,000 others living in east Jerusalem. \nThe Palestinians claim both areas, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as parts of a future independent state. The international community has opposed the settlements, built on occupied lands sought by the Palestinians, as obstacles to peace. \nBritain and Germany, close Israeli allies, as well as the European Union criticized Netanyahu's approval this week of 3,000 new settlement homes in the West Bank. \n\"This spike in settlement activity undermines trust and makes a two-state solution -- with an Israel that is safe from terrorism and a Palestinian state that is viable and sovereign -- much harder to achieve,\" said Britain's minister for the Middle East, Tobias Ellwood. \nAmona has emerged as a symbol of settler defiance. On Thursday, Israeli police completed the evacuation of the wind-swept community, where hundreds of Jewish activists joined residents in resisting the pullout. \nPolice began the evacuation Wednesday, but dozens of activists remained holed up in the synagogue. Police initially said 200 had barricaded themselves inside but later revised the number to about 100. \nOn Thursday, several hundred Israeli forces surrounded the building, and officers wearing goggles and wielding plastic shields broke through the doors and sprayed water to push back defiant protesters. \n\"The officers faced especially tough and violent resistance,\" police said in a statement. Protesters sprayed fire extinguishers at police and threw rocks, paint bottles and wooden planks, police said. \nSlogans including \"Death to Zionists\" and a swastika comparing the Israeli police to Nazis were scrawled on the synagogue walls. The police later began dragging young protesters out of the building. \nSpeaking to Israel Radio from inside the synagogue, the rabbi of Amona said the protesters were peacefully resisting the uprooting of the outpost. He spoke above loud noises and shouting in the background. Earlier Thursday, police removed protesters holed up in a small home nearby. \nPolice said 24 officers were lightly injured throughout the evacuation, and 13 young protesters were arrested. \nAmona is the largest of about 100 unauthorized outposts erected in the West Bank without formal permission but with tacit Israeli government support. It witnessed violent clashes 11 years ago when police demolished nine homes found to have been built on private Palestinian land. \nThe Supreme Court last year determined that the entire outpost was built illegally and ordered it demolished.
