Mr. Trump has criticized Boeing over the cost of a new Air Force One project, but it is also a major employer and exporter, as well as a military contractor — one that Mr. Trump has pitted against Lockheed Martin in seeking price savings on fighter jets. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Boeing has roughly 7,500 workers in South Carolina, primarily in North Charleston and Ladson, of whom a little over 3,000 are eligible for the union. There are about 30,000 unionized workers at its facilities in the Puget Sound area, where it turns out other aircraft models as well. The machinists made a similar union push here nearly two years ago, but called off a vote a several days before the scheduled election, complaining of a deluge of misinformation from management and pressure from local politicians. Two Boeing officials, who would not speak for attribution, expressed confidence that the company would turn back the unionization effort and suggested that the union was racing to act before Mr. Trump appoints two members to vacant seats on the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees union elections, and overturns its Democratic majority. If the union were to win, Boeing would have to file any objections to a regional official of the agency within days, with any subsequent appeal going to the board in Washington. Mike Evans, the machinists’ lead organizer in South Carolina, rejected that suggestion, saying the union believes it has the votes to prevail. “If we weren’t ready, we’d still be down here sharing information, getting up the facts of the benefits of collective bargaining,” he said. “We feel we’ve reached that and have a significant amount of support. That’s what dictates, ‘Why now?’” Under rules overseen by the labor board, unions can call an election once at least 30 percent of eligible workers have signed up to authorize one, but the unions typically wait until they have a substantially higher level of support to improve their odds of success. The machinists may also benefit from two years’ worth of accumulated frustrations among workers. Mr. Evans said workers felt their evaluations were frequently arbitrary, an issue that the company promised to address before the first scheduled vote. “Whatever changes were promised it’s been more of the same,” AJ Russo, a production coordinator at the Boeing plant in North Charleston, said in an interview after a pro-union rally Monday, at which he spoke. How workers are treated “depends on where you’re standing, what day it is.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The issue is all the more salient because the company recently announced it would undergo a round of job reductions that will affect its South Carolina operations amid intense competition from its chief rival, Airbus. Management has not ruled out involuntary layoffs if the company is unable to hit its goal for cost savings. While the cuts discussed so far would not affect union-eligible workers, they are a source of anxiety, Mr. Evans said. In addition to making the evaluation and layoff process fairer in the eyes of workers, a union could bargain for higher wages. The average wage for unionized Boeing workers in Washington State is about $31 per hour, versus about $23 per hour for union-eligible workers in South Carolina, according to data from the company and the union. Boeing has said the difference is driven partly by the local cost of living and labor market conditions, and partly by the longer average tenure of workers in Washington. The union says pay tops out at a certain point, making additional tenure relevant only to issues like benefits and job security, not wages.

Credit Travis Dove/Bloomberg Even if the union prevailed, it wouldn’t necessarily restore the leverage it enjoyed before the Dreamliner plant opened here. South Carolina is a “right to work” state, meaning workers do not have to join the union or pay union fees as a condition of employment. According to Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va., this was an important consideration in Boeing’s decision to locate here. “If you have just enough folks who will cross the picket lines, you can still get certification and testing work done,” Mr. Aboulafia said, alluding to the possibility of a strike. “That can make a difference in keeping some revenue coming in.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
