REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \nMSNBC host Joe Scarborough was not impressed by the television performance of one of President Donald Trump's top advisers on Sunday. \nIn a major appearance on four Sunday political talk shows this week, top adviser Stephen Miller struck an aggressive tone, standing by Trump's baseless claims about massive voter fraud, condemning a recent court ruling against Trump's immigration ban , and blasting media coverage of the new administration. \nMiller's comments about why the administration's authority \" will not be questioned \" appeared to strike a nerve for Scarborough, who said that the comments sounded \"autocracy for young politickers 101.\" \nThe MSNBC host also noted that former President Andrew Jackson, a US leader admired by the current White House leadership, was a major advocate for a strong judiciary. \n\"He talked about judicial independence. He talked about the importance of the judiciary. You really need to go back and read the Constitution,\" Scarborough said. \"And seriously, the White House has got to stop embarrassing themselves by putting this guy on.\" \nHe continued: \"That is the worst performance of anybody — that made Susan Rice the Sunday after Benghazi look smooth. That was horrendous, and an embarrassment.\" \nScarborough urged Trump to rein in Miller, saying that the adviser's dismissal of the judiciary was the \"talk of a dictator, not somebody who is president of the United States.\" The MSNBC anchor predicted that if the administration ignored the court, the president would be impeached. \n\"If that sort of thinking were enacted into policy, we would have impeachment proceedings in the next six months. Donald Trump would be impeached if they did not adhere to...what the courts were saying,\" Scarborough said. \nHe continued: \"He's sounding like an autocrat when he doesn't have to. They are creating something so he can go out and say it. Are they testing us to see if we're like sheep and say nothing?\" \nFor his part, Trump publicly touted Miller's performance on the Sunday shows, praising the adviser's performance in a tweet on Sunday. \nCongratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017 \nWhile \"Morning Joe\" was a media staple for former White House officials like Valerie Jarrett, the show has taken on new significance during the new administration due to Trump's own fondness for the show. \n\"Morning Joe\" segments seem to inspire tweets from the president, while Scarborough has occasionally offered advice to Trump both publicly and privately. \nLawmakers and advertisers alike have also taken to addressing the president directly during the show.
