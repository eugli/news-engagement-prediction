Yorke, 45, said he was prevented from entering due to an Iranian stamp on his passport which required him to get a visa in advance. He was due to travel from Doha in Qatar to Trinidad and Tobago where he has a home but was stopped in transit at Miami. Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke says he was 'made to feel like a criminal' when he was denied entry to the United States on Friday 'I couldn't quite believe what was happening', Yorke told the Sun. 'I have lost count of the number of times I have been to America, I love the country, yet I was being made to feel like a criminal. 'I had bought my ticket and checked in and was about to get on the flight when I was stopped by two officials. I thought \"what is happening here?\". 'They told me there was a visa problem and a red flag had come up against my name because of an Iranian stamp in my passport. I went there to play in a legends match to open a stadium and didn't even stay overnight. 'The two officials told me if I got on the flight I would simply be deported back to Qatar once I arrived in the States. I tried to explain I didn't even live in Qatar and was just trying to get to my home in the Caribbean.' Yorke, 45, said he was prevented from entering the USA due to an Iranian stamp on his passport Last month US President Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily barring those from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen entering the country. But Yorke was banned under a rule brought in by the Obama administration which prevents people with a stamp from those seven countries from being able to enter America without first obtaining a visa from a US embassy. He had an Iranian stamp after visiting Tehran in 2015 to play for 'World Stars' in a charity match against 'Iranian Stars'. On Thursday, Trump's administration said in court documents that it does not want a larger appeals panel to review a ruling keeping its travel ban on hold and will instead replace the ban. Yorke was a pundit on beIN Sports on Thursday night for United's 3-0 win over St Etienne Ex-Sky Sports presenter Richard Keys tweeted about Yorke's border issue on Friday morning Somalia-born British Olympic champion Sir Mo Farah called the travel ban 'deeply troubling' and has fears over his return to America. Farah lives and train in Portland, Oregon and is currently in Birmingham for the Indoor Grand Prix. Asked if he had concerns when he returns to the US he said: 'Yes, I've had issues before. But hopefully it will be fine, I always try and look on the bright side of life. I'm not going back yet.
