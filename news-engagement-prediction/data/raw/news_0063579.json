Unexpected comeback \nThe repackaged devices will then be sold in emerging markets such as India and Vietnam. \nWhether the report is accurate or not is currently unclear (there's no specific source cited by the article), but it does sound like a way to use the leftover tech from the Galaxy Note 7 problem. \nIt's unlikely Samsung will be selling the phone under the Galaxy Note 7 moniker though – the report suggests the company will make new cases for the phones and just reuse the core components. \nYesterday news broke that Samsung's reputation – measured by Harris Poll research – in the US has fallen 42 positions from seventh place to 49 after the Note 7 scandal. \nBefore the Galaxy Note 7 started to catch fire we gave it a great score of four and a half stars out of five, so it’d be great to see this technology used again in other devices. \nWe’ve spoken to Samsung to get an answer on whether the Note 7 will be making a comeback, and will update this article if and when we receive a response.
