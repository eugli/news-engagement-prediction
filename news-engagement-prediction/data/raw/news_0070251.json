Both leaders are co-chairs of the JCBC, which provides a platform to discuss ways to deepen cooperation between Singapore and China. \nThis would be the 13th JCBC meeting which has been held every year since 2004, with the exception of last year. Channel NewsAsia understands that it had to be postponed as Vice Premier Zhang had to attend an important domestic meeting. \nIn a statement on Saturday, the Prime Minister’s Office said the meeting in line with the agreement between Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2015, for an \"all-round cooperative partnership\" that progresses with the times. \nBesides the JCBC, Mr Teo will co-chair other meetings with Mr Zhang on Singapore and China's three flagship Government-to-Government projects, such as the Suzhou Industrial Park and Tianjin Eco-city. \nThe Joint Steering Council for the latest project, the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative, will also meet for the first time since the project was launched in 2015. \nThe leaders will review the progress made on the three projects and discuss the direction of future bilateral cooperation, said the Prime Minister's Office. Several agreements are also expected to be signed. \nMr Teo will be accompanied by a high-level delegation which includes seven ministers. Among them are Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Trade and Industry (Trade) Lim Hng Kiang, Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu and Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong. \nDuring his three-day visit, Mr Teo will have separate meetings with other Chinese leaders. He will also meet Singaporeans at a Ministerial Dialogue which is organised by the Singapore Embassy in Beijing and the Singapore Chamber of Commerce and Industry in China (SingCham), which is marking its 15th anniversary. - CNA/gs", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:32:35.346+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
