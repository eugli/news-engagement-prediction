So to say that “Everybody Loves Somebody” is predictable is no real criticism, as being able to foresee the ending — almost from the beginning — is exactly what most viewers expect.

Watch in Times Video » embed Our messed-up heroine is Clara (Karla Souza, clearly delighted to escape the constraints of her lugubrious character on “How to Get Away With Murder” ), an OB-GYN by day and a drunken karaoke singer by night. Fumbling hookups with random men temporarily banish her loneliness without extinguishing her torch for Daniel (José María Yazpik), the lover who abandoned her eight years earlier. Guess who shows up, though, to a family wedding to derail Clara’s fledgling bond with a cuddly Australian co-worker (Ben O’Toole)? And guess whose clothing soon evaporates in the heat of Daniel’s twinkling attention? Toggling between Los Angeles and Mexico, English and Spanish, this sophomore feature by Catalina Aguilar Mastretta asks Clara to choose between naughty and nice. The setup is commonplace, but the scenery is delicious, the dialogue refreshingly tart and the keen supporting cast frisky or affecting, as the occasion demands. Indeed, the movie’s most authentically romantic moment occurs not between Clara and her suitors, but between her sister and brother-in-law (Tiaré Scanda and K. C. Clyde), whose marriage might be showing some strain. In a single, brief conversation, they reveal more about the nature of long-term love than Clara will ever comprehend.
