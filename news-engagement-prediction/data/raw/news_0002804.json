The Blank Space seemed to have missed Ariana Grande's Break Free, Missy Elliot's WTF, Kesha's We R Who We R, and Miley Cyrus's Dooo it! to name but a few, although in Miley's case in was more a full glitter make-over. BTS: The 90-second vid gives another look into her new single with Zayn - I Don't Wanna Live Forever - from the Fifty Shades Darker soundtrack First: 'What we’re doing right now is a glitter lip that I’ve seen on shoots and on the runway and stuff, but I haven’t really seen people do it in a music video or anything,' she declared Taylor may have been joking about her make-up trailblazing, as she went on to laud her acting skills too. 'Did you catch that? Did you see that last take, what I did there? The way that I was able to emote with the back of my head,' she asked the camera after strutting dramatically down a hallway for a shot. 'See, that’s what 12 years of experience gets you.' Miss-ed it: Taylor obviously hadn't caught Missy Elliot's WTF Been there: Kesha's We R Who We R tried it as far back as 2010, while Ariana Grande also rocked the look in 2014's Break Free Did it! Miley Cyrus also did it in Dooo it! although in her case in was more a full glitter make-over Earlier in the vid, Swift bemoaned her early call time on the London shoot, with her co-star was still in bed. 'It’s earlier than I care to really even say. We’re starting to shoot the video for I Don’t Wanna Live Forever,' she groaned. 'And I’m first because clearly I don’t demand late enough call times because Zayn’s asleep somewhere in London, I imagine, under some kind of silk duvet.'
