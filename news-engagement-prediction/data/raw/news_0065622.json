The McGill University has published a study in the journal Scientific Reports that proves the feeling we get from listening to good music is the same as an orgasm or when you are high. It was discovered that the brains of the subjects in the study lit up when listening to music. The brain patterns during this experience were similar to those during sex and when doing drugs. \nMusic is just like sex and drugs (sexandviolins) When listening to music, the human brain releases pleasure-inducing chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin. These chemicals are also released by the brain during sex and when doing certain drugs such as heroin, cocaine, and molly. \nMusic gets you high as drugs according to new findings (globalmusicperspectives) This new finding puts a spin on the popular Scarface quotable, \" don't get high on your own supply. \" Apparently, we have been getting high on our own supply when listening to our favourite songs, albums and playlists.
