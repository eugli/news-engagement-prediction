While the PS4 Pro will be available for buying in mid-February, the PS VR bundle will be available in March. The bundle is available for pre-ordering at select stores now, the company announced. Sony has also announced another PS VR bundle without the camera for Rs 37,990 and it will be available for buying sometime later during the year. \nThe PS4 Pro comes with an upgraded CPU, an improved GPU and greater bandwidth over the original PS4. Here's a lowdown of what's inside the new console from Sony: \n-- CPU: 8 Jaguar cores at 2.1 GHz as opposed to 8 Jaguar cores clocked at 1.6GHz in the original \n-- GPU: Improved AMD GCN, 36 CUs at 911 MHz up from 18 Radeon GCN compute units at 800MHz in the PS4 \n-- RAM: 8 GB GDDR5, 218 GB/s which is a 24 per cent boost to bandwidth in comparison to the previous model \n-- Storage: 1TB \nEssentially, we are looking at higher (and more stable) frame rates, enhanced visual (graphical) fidelity, additional graphics features and not to forget, the ability to upscale 1080p content to 4K provided you have a 4K-ready monitor. \n\"PS4 Pro will sit alongside the standard PS4, which will also be available in a slimmer and lighter model starting at Rs 27,990 and provide consumers with more choice. Users can play every PS4 game on both PS4 Pro and the standard PS4,\" the company said in a statement. \nClearly, Sony wants both the PS4 and the PS4 Pro to co-exist. That's probably why it wants developers not to build PS4 Pro-exclusive games. At the same time, there will be no PS4 Pro-exclusive in-game content or VR-exclusive PS4 Pro modes. All PS4 Pro-based games will run on the PS4 and vice-versa. The PS4 Pro will just be able to squeeze better graphics out of these games. As for existing games, developers will have the option to integrate PS4 Pro support into them via patches. \nThe PS VR will (also) be compatible with both the systems. The PS VR is a game-ready virtual reality headset from Sony that \"leverages technologies, such as 360-degree head tracking, wide field of view, high refresh rates, and a binaural 3D audio technology.\" The PS VR is different from a certain HTC Viva and Oculus Rift, in that it doesn't require a high-end PC to function. All it needs is a PlayStation Camera and/or the Move motion controllers and quite obviously a PS4/PS4 Pro.
