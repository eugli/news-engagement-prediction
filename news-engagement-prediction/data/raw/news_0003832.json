Some 8.8 million die of cancer each year.\nThe WHO acknowledged that the challenges were greater in poorer countries, where diagnostic services such as imaging, laboratory and pathology skills are rarer.\nThe health agency urged such countries to prioritize \"basic, high-impact and low-cost cancer diagnosis and treatment services.\"\nIt said it was important to reduce the number of cases where patients have to pay for care out of their own pockets — which stops many from seeking help.\n© Thomson Reuters, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.who.int/cancer/en/", "http://thomsonreuters.com/"], "published": "2017-02-03T19:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:53:42.902+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
