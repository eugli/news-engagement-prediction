But than you see it, and the rest, as they say, is history; it is a masterpiece. Spike Lee has crafted a film that is emotionally draining, but ultimately rewards the viewer in the end. It's not as preachy as you may be lead to believe, so give it a chance, and, though this can't be said about very many films anymore, it will change your life. This is one of the greatest film of all time And is one of my favorite films dealing with serious issues A Must See by NYJ~MA Spike Lee's best film ever created. It's ability to travel across time with powerful messages about race, hate, and love; along with hilarious comedy, crowns this film an automatic Classic. It was the first movie I bought with ITunes.
