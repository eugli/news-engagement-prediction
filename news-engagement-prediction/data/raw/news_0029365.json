Thank You 4 Your service . \nBut it was Consequence and Busta Rhymes ’s entrance that kicked off the performance’s most powerful moment. Clearly fired up, Busta addressed President Donald Trump (whom he called “Agent Orange”) directly, rebuking his \"Muslim ban\" and calling on the audience to fight against hatred and bigotry. That’s when the whole crew — joined onstage by people wearing hijabs — launched into ATCQ’s “We the People.” The performance ended with Q-Tip passionately chanting “Resist! Resist! Resist! Resist!” \nSee clips from the rousing performance below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:49:24.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
