For those punters who are aiming to land a huge priced winner, Betfair's latest new customer offer could be of interest. \nThe online bookmaker are going 25/1 (26.0) on Manchester City, Atletico Madrid, Sevilla and Juventus all winning the first legs of their respective matches. That's double the price currently available which stands at a shade over 11/1 (12.0). \nTo take up this offer simply register using the link provided, back the four teams to win their matches at the usual odds on site and if they all oblige then the returns will be topped up to the value of 25/1 (26.0). Winnings paid as free bets. T&C's apply. \nAtletico Madrid's (6/4) impressive European pedigree sees them as the usual dark horse pick in this year's competition, but their credentials are well and truly out in the open after topping their group which included Bayern Munich and drawing more German opposition in the knockout stages in the form of Bayer Leverkusen. \nManchester City (4/7) are well fancied to take a first leg lead in their clash with Monaco at the Etihad Stadium in what could be the game of the week as two top heavy teams go head-to-head. \nJuventus (13/10) visit Porto and, with the Turin club already boasting an imposing lead in Serie A, Max Allegri will hope to enhance his impressive reputation which sees him as the favourite to replace Arsene Wenger at Arsenal. If this game is expected to be a tight, low-scoring affair, then the other game on Wednesday night could well be a polar opposite. \nSevilla (2/5) are the shortest price on the midweek coupon by a significant distance. Not only are they putting up a string of impressive domestic performances after a turbulent summer but the Europa League holders have plenty of experience in high pressure European clashes, unlikely their debutant opponents Leicester City. \nGiven their group stage results, the chance to back Claudio Ranieri's men at a best price of 9/1 (10.0) might have caught the eye but the Foxes' domestic form has gone from bad to worse and with the Italian boss seemingly the only top flight manager in danger of losing his job in the immediate future, this game could be a tipping point for the club's Thai owners. \nThe four matches offer a tasty acca at 11/1 (12.0) but anyone without a Betfair account will surely be tempted by the prospect of landing a 25/1 (26.0) winner courtesy of this offer.
