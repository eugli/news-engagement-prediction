Mamta is a saleable star and has the acting chops to back it up as well, so she was the first on our list. Her role is as significant as Prithvi's in the film,\" says Nirmal. \"As much as it might sound cliched, the audience have not seen her in this avatar before.\"\nMamta confirms that she's part of the cast. \"We will start filming in May, if all goes well. Also, we have an extended workshop in April before we start shooting,\" says the actress. Mamta and Prithviraj had previously teamed up in Anwar, which was directed by Amal Neerad, and Celluloid, which was directed by Kamal.\nPrithviraj's character is part of a Tamil street gang in Detroit in the movie, which is a neo-noir film with violence as part of the plot. Nirmal says, \"We are trying to show that there's a big immigrant community in Detroit and how everything ties in to Prithvi's character. The city has a lot of importance.\"\nOn the English and Malayalam versions of the movie, he says, \"We are in talks for releasing the English version in the US. The Malayalam film will have a bit of Tamil as well to keep it authentic.\" The director also says that the Malayalam version will have another title that will be announced soon.\nJakes Bejoy will be handling the music department. \"The soundscape of the movie is also another important element in the film and the development of the characters, and Jakes is currently busy with the work,\" he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T18:18:28.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
