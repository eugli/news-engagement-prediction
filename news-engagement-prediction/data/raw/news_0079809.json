Just look at his bow tie: the dude has style. So it only made sense that Jimmy Kimmel tried to steal some of his star power by recruiting the 8-year-old actor for a bit where he lifted above his head like he was in the Lion King. Move over, Donald Glover . There's a new Simba in town. Your browser does not support the video tag. ABC Mahershala decided to share his Academy Award Mahershala Ali made history by becoming the first Muslim to win an acting Oscar , earning a statuette for his supporting role in Moonlight.

Hey @realDonaldTrump u up? — Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) February 27, 2017 Jimmy Kimmel trolled the President In addition to taking a few one-liner jabs at President Trump in his monologue, Kimmel pulled out his phone halfway through the ceremony and sent a few messages to our nation's Tweeter-in-Chief. \"U up?\" Kimmel asked, before sending another one with the hashtag #MerylSaysHi.

That's what friends are for. Kevin Winter / Getty Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty read the wrong envelope Beatty got kinda confused when he saw the winner for Best Picture; the envelope read \"Emma Stone, La La Land ,\" after all. Afterward -- once the La La Land crew had to give their statuettes to the real winners, Moonlight -- he said he wasn't trying to be funny. But he kinda was. That, and insane. As Kimmel appropriately said, \"Personally, I blame Steve Harvey.\" Sign up here for our daily Thrillist email, and get your fix of the best in food/drink/fun.
