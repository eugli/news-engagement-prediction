The photographs and videos of seven artists contain glimpses of their social environments, reminding us that performance art comes out of attempts to bridge the gap between art and life. SHARE Khvay Samnang's Rubber Man #2 , 2014. Photo: Supplied \nViewers familiar with Western body and action art of the 20th century would do well to remember the importance of the living theatrical and choreographic traditions of our Asian neighbours. Works drawing directly on those traditions include Cambodian Khvay Samnang's Where Is My Land? (2014), featuring the powerful body of Nget Rady​; and F'n'F (Face and Fingers) (2008-09), by Khmer artist Moe Satt​. \nWhile Satt's sensuous semaphore gestures towards what cannot be said in a repressive society, a productive irony (meaning what is conveyed contradicts the ostensible message) is visualised in his T he Bicycle-Tyre-Rolling Event From Yangon (2013). With its seemingly incidental background of city monuments to power, the suggestion of \"revolution\" is inescapable in the turning circle in the work's foreground, guided by an apparently freewheeling Satt in traditional formal attire. Given the decades-long government genocide of Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine province, we marvel at the insouciance of this artist born to a Buddhist mother and a Muslim father.

Photo: Supplied \nApart from demands for gender and racial equality, it's been decades since anything other than art for art's sake has motivated Australian artists, and we might question the political imperatives of some of the work in this show. A case in point is the work of Melati Suryodarmo, born in Indonesia in 1969 and a former student of – and assistant to – endurance-art superstar Marina Abramovic​. Her 12-hour performance I'm a Ghost in My Own House (2002) is characterised by introspection and a taste for abjection. \nAlso unproductive, because merely illustrative, are works by the Indonesian-born Australian resident of Chinese descent Dadang Christanto​; and by Malaysia's Liew Teck Leong. SHARE Liew Teck Leong's Body+Dots+Politics (Yellow) , 2016. Photo: Supplied \nIn contrast, for Chinese-Singaporean Lee Wen, cultural identity and the frailty of the ailing human body generate images of great poignancy. Wen describes himself as an \"image-maker\" – as indeed did the US performance artists of the 1950s and 1960s whose happenings and staged events took the artist out of the studio and invited audience participation, in attempts to politicise the artistic experience. The crucial difference in the lived experience of contemporary artists in Southeast Asia is that politics may have to be aestheticised to be practised at all. \nA music video by Vietnam's Tran Luong​ features a mesmerising repeated hammer strike. It juxtaposes the harmony with the \"natural\" world that Samnang achieves when he lends his body to the environment. We see the Cambodian artist up to his neck in dirty lake water, or doused in the milky sap of the rubber tree in attempts to visualise the effects of urban development or the dispossession of communities by global financial interests.
