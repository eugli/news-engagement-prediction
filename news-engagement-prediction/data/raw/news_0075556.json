Picture: Facebook\n“Rest easy Amir, you were one hell of a brother man, can’t believe you were taken from us. This still doesn’t feel real, this just feels like a big nightmare and I really want to wake up. I miss you man, you were one brave soldier. Allah Yerhamo, taken too young.”\nDetective Inspector Brad Ainsworth from Wollongong Local Area Command told AAP the situation was tragic for the family and his friends.\n“It’s tragic. He had his three mates who watched on, that witnessed everything — they pulled him from the water. You can only describe it as horrific, really, and I suppose, if we want to put a warning to it, watch where you swim and be aware of your surrounds.”\nSuburban Islamic Association publicity officer Tamrez Khan said the local Muslim community was in mourning at the tragic loss and said the Minto Mosque would welcome members of the community over the weekend to pay their respects.\nmedia_camera Tributes placed at Robert Townson High School for Amir.
