This time, the Australian pace spearead pulled out of the IPL, leaving a big void in the team. \nThe Royal Challengers undoubtedly, have the most daunting batting line-up with the likes of Chris Gayle , Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Shane Watson, Lokesh Rahul and Kedar Jadhav. \nAll they needed was an explosive pacer and RCB spared no effort in signing on Mills, who is one of the most exciting young pacers in the shortest format today. \nIn four T20 Internationals so far, he has picked three wickets and has a decent economy rate of 7.25. At 24, he is very experienced in T20 cricket, having played 55 matches over four years. \nRCB coach Daniel Vettori said his team needed something different and exceptional to succeed and hence their aggressive bid for Mills.
