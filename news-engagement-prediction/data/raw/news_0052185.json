Wells has no hesitation; Chester comes first. \nWells' temporary accommodation did not allow dogs, so with an advance on her benefit from Work and Income she has moved into a motel with Chester. Kevin Stent \nKapiti Coast woman Diane Wells, who has brittle bone disease and cerebral palsy, and has spoken about her love of her dog Chester, and her battle for accommodation support. \nBut she is only booked in for a week and Work and Income has said while it could advance her more cash, it will not give her an emergency housing grant. \nOn Wednesday afternoon, some relief was in sight for Wells when, after media inquiries, a Work and Income manager rang her to say they would do everything they could to find her accommodation. \nThe case has seen the Social Development Minister, Anne Tolley, say she expects her staff to do \"their very best\" to meet the individual circumstances of clients. Chris Skelton \nSocial Development Minister Anne Tolley. \nWells said on Wednesday that she was born with a form of brittle bone disease and cerebral palsy. \nShe had never let the disease hold her back till about three years ago when a wheelchair collapsed on her. \n\"It broke my femur, my tibia and my spine ... that accident dropped me back a little bit.\" Joel Maxwell \nDisability advocate Paul Curry. \nNow on good days she can get herself out of bed, otherwise she waits for a caregiver to arrive. Ad Feedback \nWells' decision to adopt Chester in 2006 had changed her life over the past decade. \n\"He's the world to me. I've lost a lot of people close to me in the last few years. I just want to be with Chester to the end. That is so important to me.\" \nShe was now paying back vets in instalments for surgery that would extend his life. \nShe would never forgive herself if she couldn't be with him. \"I've suffered bad depression over the last few years. If it wasn't for my Chester, I wouldn't be here probably.\" \nWith her health declining, Wells had been forced this month to move from Otaki Beach to temporary accommodation in Paraparaumu so she had access to after-hours caregivers. \nDogs were not allowed in the new accommodation so Chester, a kelpi-corgi cross, went into a boarding kennel. \nBut during tests on Chester before a planned move by Wells and the dog to Australia, it was found he had terminal cancer. \nWells set about trying to find a place where she and Chester could stay together. \nShe said the Ministry of Social Development's Work and Income agency initially told her that she would qualify for an emergency accommodation grant. \nBut last week at the Paraparaumu Work and Income office she was told they had checked, and there was no reason she had to leave her accommodation. \nShe could stay there but she had \"chosen\" to be homeless, they said. \nREAD MORE:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:24:45.436+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
