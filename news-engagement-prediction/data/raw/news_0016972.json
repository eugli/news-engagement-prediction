Deaths due to traffic accidents jumped 33 per cent in January this year, compared to the same month in 2016, Dubai Police has said.This was revealed by Brigadier Saif Mohair Al Mazroui, who said 12 deaths were recorded in January 2017, compared to nine deaths in January last year.He attributed this spike in road deaths to repetition of traffic violations despite imminent danger, such as not leaving enough distance between vehicles and sudden lane changes.There were more deaths in the last week of January than any other week, which led to the overall rise in road fatalities.He said the current death rate is 1 per cent of overall population, and Dubai Police wants to bring this ratio down to zero by 2020.The last year saw a 19.3 per cent increase in deaths on the road (198 deaths in 2,999 accidents), compared to 166 deaths in 3,090 accidents in 2015.
