From the day of her engagement when a luckily-timed 'upcoming beauty' Lord Snowdon photoshoot for Vogue triggered a nationwide binge on pink chiffon blouses, Lady Diana Spencer's fashion choices were a global obsession. SHARE Outfits on display at \"Diana: Her Fashion Story\" at Kensington Palace. Photo: Richard Lea-Hair/Kensington Palace \nAnd for the next two years visitors to Kensington Palace in London can relive that obsession, at a collection of dresses notorious, glamorous and poignant, culminating with a small sample from the 79 cocktail and evening dresses sold at that auction just two months before she died. \n\"At the time, it was seen as her closing a chapter,\" says exhibition producer Poppy Cooper. \"Sadly, we don't know what the next chapter would have been.\" SHARE Twenty-five dresses will be on display for the two-year exhibition. Photo: Richard Lea-Hair/Kensington Palace \nThat packed Christie's auction in Manhattan broke a house record for a piece of clothing: the off-the-shoulder, ink-blue velvet dinner dress she wore when she danced at the White House with John Travolta went for US$222,500 ($288,600). \nThat dress is part of the Kensington Palace display, along with 24 others, stretching from the demure outfits of the early days, to the confident glamour of her later life.

SHARE Share on Twitter Link Princess Diana, wearing an evening dress designed by Victor Edelstein, dances with movie star John Travolta during her visit to America at the White House on November 9, 1985 in Washington, DC.

As Roland Klein, one of her favourite designers put it, \"when she was wearing something that was photographed it had an immediate effect\". \nDiana took it seriously. The exhibition includes several of the sketches sent to her by British designers – some she returned with a note or a request (\"Please!\" her excited handwriting says on one sketch). She would spread the sketches about her on the floor, comparing fabrics and styles. \n\"She was a real boon to the fashion industry,\" Ms Cooper says. \"She learned the rules of royal dress, but then she started taking risks, being experimental.\" \nSome were mistakes (for example, the infamous green tartan 'horse blanket' worn on an official visit to Italy in 1985, then never seen again). \nBut most were lauded. In 1986, at the America's Cup Ball at the Grosvenor House Hotel, she wore a black velvet bodice with red silk taffeta skirt, paired with one red and one black glove. It was riotously successful. And in 1989 a black and white silk satin cocktail dress, worn to a night at the Barbican, was a playful interpretation of a masculine tuxedo. \nFor charity she went practical, with children she went floral, and when shopping on Bond St she was spotted in an executive-style, sexy blue shift dress. Her influences ranged from Grace Kelly to Madonna. \nShe wanted to be known as a \"workhorse not a clotheshorse\", Ms Cooper says, but she was acutely aware of the attention on her wardrobe, and hoped to exploit it to draw attention to the charitable causes she cared about. \n\"She understood her image was powerful,\" Ms Cooper says. \"She wanted to use that. \nMs Cooper said Diana's sons have not yet visited the collection – but the royal household kept a close eye on the development of the exhibition. \nDiana died on August 31, 1997. This spring, Kensington Palace, where she once lived, will also put on a special display for Diana. Many of the palace's gardeners knew the princess, and remember her fondness for walks in the sunken garden, which will be transformed into a memorial 'White Garden'. \nThe flowers and foliage are inspired by memories of the Princess's life, image and style: tulips and scented narcisii through a carpet of 'forget me nots', then pots of classic English white roses in the summer around the reflective pool. \nWhen the flowers bloom, it will be another tribute to a princess who was well aware of the power of beauty.
