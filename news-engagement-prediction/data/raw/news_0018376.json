The case was brought by the state governments represented in the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat.\nThe court ruled that the party did not have the potential to overthrow democracy in Germany.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2B77/production/_85172111_028696798-1.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-09T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T01:20:35.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
