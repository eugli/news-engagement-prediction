Regardless, just because you're spending Valentine's Day alone this year doesn't mean you have to miss out on all the holiday-themed fun. Show yourself some love by making this delicious heart-shaped pizza. \nWhy this recipe? Well, first the obvious: The pizza is shaped like a heart. It's vaguely appropriate for Valentine's Day, but it's more about self-love in the form of pizza (the best form of self-love, if you ask me). There's also the fact that you can eat as much of it as you want (sharing can be such a drag sometimes, right?), and you don't have to worry about the garlic, Brussels sprouts, and caramelized onions having any, um, adverse effects on you later in the evening. \nIf you want a cooking project — to pass the time, to take your mind off things, or just because you prefer to make everything from scratch — the authors of this recipe give you two homemade pizza dough options (one for the stand mixer, and one for the food processor). But you can also just pick up a pre-made dough from your grocery store or favorite pizza joint. The most important thing is that you shape it into a heart! \nTop the dough with crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, shredded mozzarella , shaved Pecorino, caramelized onions (another great cooking project that requires your attention for a better part of an hour), and thinly sliced Brussels sprouts before baking. \nOnce your pizza is ready, all you have to do is pour yourself a glass of red wine, queue up your favorite movie on Netflix, and dig in. \n→ Get the Recipe : Heart-Shaped Caramelized Onion and Brussels Sprout Pizza from A Couple Cooks More posts in Delicious Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:23:13.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
