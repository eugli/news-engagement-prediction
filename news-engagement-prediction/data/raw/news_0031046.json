With the win, the Warriors improved to an NBA-best 46-8 on the year, while the Thunder fell to 31-24. \nThe game was out of hand from the first quarter onward, and despite the loud boos from the Oklahoma City crowd, Durant left the stadium with his head held high. \nAfter the game, it wasn’t Durant, but it was his Warriors teammates that made headlines, though. \nThe reason? Check it out below. \nThat’s right. Draymond Green and Steph Curry wore cupcake t-shirts, completely trolling Westbrook and the Thunder fans in the process. \nSay what you want about Green on the court, but off the court, he’s electric in media interviews. \nGolden State’s outspoken defensive anchor didn’t have much to say about the shirts after posting six points, eight rebounds, eight assists and three steals in the win, but you could tell that he was fighting back laughter when asked about it. \nCurry, who posted 26 points, eight rebounds and nine assists in the victory, explained that he traded his warmups to a fan for the shirt after the game. \nWhile you can’t call it a rivalry (because both teams need to compete in order for that to happen), the drama between the clubs is arguably more intense than between any other matchup in the NBA. \nThe cupcake t-shirts just added to that drama in a hilarious way.
