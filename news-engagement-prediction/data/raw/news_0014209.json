Sure, they don’t show up in the most thrilling aspects of our lives, but their utility is undeniably integral to everyday tasks, whether you’re typing up a resumé or number-crunching in an Excel spreadsheet.\nWhen you set out to buy the best keyboard, you’ll notice a striking amount of variety – there are keyboards that cover only the basics and others with 50g of actuation force that last for 80 million keystrokes . There are mechanical and membrane, wired and wireless, wacky and ergonomic and even those that are best paired with giant trackpads .\nFor that reason, we've narrowed down our picks to ten of the best, designed to satisfy the needs of both you and your wallet.\nDon't skimp on the best mouse pads for gaming in 2017 How to select the right keyboard for you It goes without saying that if you demand the look and feel only mechanical switches can provide, rather than keys that press a membrane, we suggest perusing our top 10 best gaming keyboards round-up instead.\nGamers more or less demand the actuation and clickety-clacks of mechanical keys, but not everyone does, especially those who need to work in silence. That’s why many of the best keyboards on this list take the membrane approach, opting for flatter, more compact keys muted by the design of their switches.\nNote that the keyboards below were provided to TechRadar by UK-based keyboard re-seller The Keyboard Company:\nTopre Realforce 87U Tenkeyless Topre Realforce 104 UBS Silent variable Filco Majestouch-2 Tenkeyless Unicomp Classic 104\n1. Topre Realforce 87U Tenkeyless A low-profile speed machine\nInterface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: No | Switches: Topre electrostatic capacitive (30/45/55 grams variable, 45 grams, 55 grams)\nIncredible typing feel High-quality PBT keycaps Bulky chassis Awkward cable position Made by the Japanese Topre Corporation, the Realforce is, as its name suggests, a force of nature in the keyboard world. It's all down to the Topre switches inside, which in contrast to Cherry's MX switches, are super smooth to type on and are often compared to playing weighted piano keys. The RealForce comes in both 45- and 55-gram configurations, though which one you buy depends on the importance of key weight. Oh, and we should probably mention that neither come cheap.\n2. Topre Realforce 104UBS Silent variable For a quieter Topre experience\nInterface: Wired | Switches: Topre electrostatic capacitive silenced (30, 45 and 50 grams)\nSmooth typing action Very quiet Typing can feel 'sandy' Expensive So long as you don't mind losing some of the \"thock\" sound associated with a regular Realforce keyboard, opting for a silenced model like the 104 UBS lets you reap real benefits. Hitting the 104 UBS's keys produces sound on a par with membrane keyboards, so it's perfect for busy offices or shared bedrooms. The \"dampened\" feel of Topre's silenced switches can feel a little bit like typing on sandpaper compared to non-silenced Topre, but we found that it's worth the trade-off if you want a much quieter keyboard.\n3. Filco Majestouch-2 Tenkeyless Built like a tank and compact\nInterface: Wired | Switches: Cherry MX (Brown, Blue, Black, Red)\nSolid build quality Compact No media functions Filco's keyboards tend to be built like tanks, and the Majestouch TKL is no different. This space-saving mechanical keyboard features a compact tenkeyless design that has less than 1cm of space between the edge of the keys and the keyboard. Its durability doesn't simply allow it to stand up well to knocks and scrapes – it has a positive impact on its typing feel too. You can hammer away on it at speed, even bottoming out to your heart's content, and the Majestouch 2 will take every bit of punishment.\n4. PFU Happy Hacking Professional 2 (HHKB2) A coder's dream and typist's treasure\nInterface: Wired | Switches: Topre electrostatic capacitive (45 grams)\nIncredibly portable Lightweight Key layout not for everybody No arrow keys Somewhat legendary in keyboard circles, the PFU Happy Hacking Professional 2 (or HHKB2 as it's usually referred to) is that rare beast - a 60% Topre keyboard. Aimed at coders but fantastic for document warriors too, it foregoes traditional arrow keys, instead making use of function keys and key combinations to provide such functionality. It only takes a short while to get used to, once you've got there the huge benefit is that the HHKB2 is small and light enough to take anywhere, giving you access to that sweet Topre \"thock\" sound and feel anywhere, anytime.\n5. Leopold Fc660c Has just enough keys to be useful\nInterface: Wired | Switches: Topre electrostatic capacitive (45 grams)\nCompact, but with arrow keys Satisfying typing feel Heavier than HHKB2 Leopold's Fc660c is more portable than the Realforce 87u, but less so than the lighter and more compact HHKB2. However, the Fc660c benefits from its extra heft and feels like the more solid board. Despite having the same 45 gram actuation force as the HHKB2, the Leopold's keys feel slightly weightier - somewhere nearer to 50 grams. It results one of the most satisfying \"thock\" sounds on a Topre board.\n6. Unicomp Classic 104 The ultimate keyboard for typing nostalgia\nInterface: Wired | Switches: Buckling spring\nSnappy buckling spring switch Retro design Can lead to tired fingers Big and bulky Remember IBM's legendary Model M keyboard? That's what the Unicomp Classic 104 sets out to imitate. Available in USB and PS/2 versions, it uses a buckling spring switch that takes more effort to depress than just about every other switch type. You're rewarded with a tactile response that recalls the classic mechanical keyboards of old, along with a noise that would drive your co-workers insane.\n7. Cooler Master NovaTouch TKL Topre switches with a Cherry MX twist\nInterface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: No | Programmable keys: No\nTopre switches great for typing Cherry MX compatible keycaps Compact Bland design No backlighting Cooler Master has achieved a number of firsts with the NovaTouch TKL. It's the first affordable keyboard to use Topre switches, a hybrid variation that feels halfway between using a membrane and mechanical keyboard.\nThough linear, rather than tactile, the NovaTouch TKL's keys have a typewriter-like quality and make 'bottoming out' (striking the key so it depresses all the way down) curiously satisfying.\nIt's the first affordable Topre keyboard, with other models retailing at twice the price. It's also the first of its type to use stems compatible with Cherry MX keycaps, allowing you to chop and change keycaps at your leisure. We're quite keen on the stock ones, funnily enough, but the choice is great to have.\n8. Das Keyboard Prime 13 Mixing minimalistic style with premium quality\nInterface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: White | Switch type: Cherry MX Red or Brown switches\nCherry MX switches Solid, minimalistic design Pricey No volume rocker Some keyboards just ooze class, and the Das Keyboard Prime 13 is one of them. Its features a solid aluminum top panel for added rigidity and a very minimalistic look. With Cherry's MX Red or Brown switches under the keycaps, you're given a choice between linear and non-linear offerings with a range of actuation points.\nIt's a great option for media enthusiasts thanks to side lit media control and the inclusion of white backlighting is another bonus. It's not the most affordable keyboard on our list, but if you're looking for something a little bit more premium, Das is the way to go.\n9. Logitech K780 A great option for mobile device owners\nInterface: Wired | Keyboard backlighting: No\nPairs to three devices Cradle holds smartphones and tablets AA, rather than rechargeable battery According to a government survey, the average British household owned 7.4 internet-connected devices in 2015. Logitech is targeting smartphone and tablet owners who prefer to see their device's display while sat at a computer with its latest keyboard, the K780. If you liked its predecessor, the K380, there's more to love here. (Literally thanks to its added numberpad.)\nThe K780 can still pair with up to three devices using Bluetooth or wireless, allowing you to chop and change between them, and it features the same comfortable rounded keycaps that remain a pleasure to type on. The star of the show, however, is the keyboard's base, which can hold mobile devices up to 11.3mm thick in an upright position. This places them within arms' reach to make anything from replying to WhatsApp messages or reading a digital magazine easy as pie.\n10. Microsoft Universal Foldable Keyboard A compact, Surface-like keyboard\nInterface: Bluetooth | Features: Compact, USB charging, works with Android, Windows Phone and iOS\nCompact Comfortable keys Unsuitable for laps Like a Surface Pro 3 Type Cover that can convert to a tent, Microsoft's Universal Foldable Keyboard is among the most \"fun-sized\" on our list. Fold it closed and you have one of the most travel-friendly Bluetooth keyboards around, barely larger than a pack of cards.\nAlso reminiscent of the Type Cover, the Universal Foldable Keyboard is equally uncomfortable for typing on your lap (then again, most keyboards are). Nevertheless, USB charging and simple Bluetooth syncing makes the Universal Foldable Keyboard a preferred option over touchscreen display inputs – so long as you have a flat surface handy.\n ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3004dbe881393a46f811edb5c75d684b-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5917a600046e59101eca155f7cf7ce45-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5f692f67865fc6874967835d7f867718-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3004dbe881393a46f811edb5c75d684b-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5f692f67865fc6874967835d7f867718-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f0c33dd4f78331187dab3356b4324749-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/1848a82e430c927920a7bfc21f2b2a21.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f0c33dd4f78331187dab3356b4324749-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/1d2a4e1f39172b759c31ce0f99d877ce.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5f692f67865fc6874967835d7f867718.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4a95f6c2b361608b53b81c30ee6f2ad5-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn0.static.techradar.futurecdn.net/media/img/missing-image.svg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/75549704b3d25142fb2a988a1758e7b2.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/662fd36e6e838f246c6d26b4d3e57cab-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/1d2a4e1f39172b759c31ce0f99d877ce-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/75549704b3d25142fb2a988a1758e7b2-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/662fd36e6e838f246c6d26b4d3e57cab-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5917a600046e59101eca155f7cf7ce45.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/1848a82e430c927920a7bfc21f2b2a21-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4a95f6c2b361608b53b81c30ee6f2ad5.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/1848a82e430c927920a7bfc21f2b2a21-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5917a600046e59101eca155f7cf7ce45-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/603faa4a5cf14c6a6406f1026553479c.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/75549704b3d25142fb2a988a1758e7b2-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/603faa4a5cf14c6a6406f1026553479c-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3004dbe881393a46f811edb5c75d684b.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/1d2a4e1f39172b759c31ce0f99d877ce-320-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/603faa4a5cf14c6a6406f1026553479c-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/662fd36e6e838f246c6d26b4d3e57cab.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4a95f6c2b361608b53b81c30ee6f2ad5-650-80.jpg", "http://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f0c33dd4f78331187dab3356b4324749.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-03T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T14:56:02.082+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
