Ad Feedback \nHouse told the court he killed the kangaroo for food because he had fallen on hard times and used the metal bar because his gun license was confiscated two years earlier. \n\"I tried to put out the roo in the most humanely way I could,\" House told the court. \nThe magistrate disagreed with House claiming there were \"large elements of animal cruelty\". \n\"In my view, you were having fun tormenting that kangaroo,\" he said. \nRSPCA WA chief executive David van Ooran told ABC it was it was \"incredibly rare\" for someone to be given a jail term for animal cruelty. \n\"I can't think of a time in recent years and decades where this has occurred,\" van Ooran said. \n\"This is a very strong penalty and a very appropriate penalty ... it was clearly a horrific and sickening act against a defenceless animal, behaviour like this is completely unacceptable. \n\"It's excellent to see that the magistrate in this case has awarded a prison term.\" - The West Australian", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:05:46.303+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
