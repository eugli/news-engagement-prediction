Long Story \nAhh, girl fights, there’s nothing quite like them. Don’t believe us? Wait until you see this video shot on the drunk streets of Austin, Texas. It stars quite the array of young ladies (we’ve managed to count six) who, for one reason or another, really want to beat the crap out of each other. \nFilmed by a bystander who has some shockingly good camera skills (seriously, kudos to you, sir… or lady), the video clocks in at over two minutes and shows off a vicious brawl that went down on 6th Street in downtown Austin. As the girls tumble to the sidewalk, there’s a lot of hair pulling, breasts popping out of dresses and more crotch shots than we can count. See, this is what happens when you start a fight in your best club attire and no underwear. #rookiemistake \nCops try to break up the fight by spraying the girls with mace in their faces and, for whatever reason, right in their lady parts, but even that’s not enough to stop them and the police soon retreat. Presumably to watch the insane action unfold. Just check how long it takes them to react to the obnoxious (but totally genius) kid who jumps in for a photo opp. New Tinder profile pic, anyone? \nAs one viewer points out in the comments section, \"Can we take a moment to appreciate the cinematics in this thing? This has to be the best camera work i've ever seen film a street fight.﻿\" Like we said, forget Arrival and La La Land , this is the best performance of 2017.

Drop This Fact \nA national survey found that, in 2010, one in four girls aged 12-17 was involved in a serious fight or attack and those numbers are on the rise.
