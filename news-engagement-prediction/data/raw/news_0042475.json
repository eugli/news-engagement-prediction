Kids have been lining up outside the brand’s Lafayette store for almost a week, patiently waiting to get their hands on the new Spring ’17 collection , which includes a few candy-colored windbreakers, a cherry red faux fur, and an anorak printed with Barack Obama’s portrait. This afternoon, those hypebeasts were also flooding a less likely spot: the subway station. Supreme just released its hotly anticipated collaboration with the MTA, a limited-edition MetroCard stamped with Supreme’s red and white logo. After my boyfriend saw the news on Twitter, I walked to the Prince Street N/Q/R station (just a few blocks from the Lafayette Street store) to investigate; underground, there were enough kids with Bape shark hoodies and skateboards to figure out why they were huddling around the MetroCard machines. As far as I could tell, none of them had scored a Supreme card yet; one guy was begging the attendant in the booth for information, but she simply smiled and shrugged. As usual, we have social media to thank for the frenzy. The @NYCTSubway Twitter account broke the news this morning, and a few hours later, it followed up with a list of locations that are selling the cards: Broadway-Lafayette, 125th Street/Lenox Avenue, Prince Street, Spring Street (the 6 line), and Union Square in Manhattan; Queensboro Plaza in Queens; and Marcy Avenue and Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. The account has also been responding to inquiries about the cards; one person asked if you had to buy it at a booth or a MetroCard machine, and @NYCTSubway responded: “Majority of them are in the machines but there may be some in the booth. However demand is high.” Like with any Supreme collab, the resale market is heating up, too. The cards, which come with $5.50 (just more than enough to cover two subway trips) are fetching upwards of $100 on eBay . Of course, it’s likely that whoever buys the cards won’t actually be using them for the morning commute tomorrow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:34:53.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
