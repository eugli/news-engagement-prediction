'Previous studies reporting links between cat ownership and psychosis simply failed to adequately control for other possible explanations.' Up to a third of people in Britain are expected to be infected by T gondii at some point in their life, although most will fight it off without noticing. Around 350 cases are reported in England and Wales each year, but the actual number could be as high as 350,000. And relax: Up to a third of people in Britain are expected to be infected by T gondii at some point in their life, although most will fight it off without noticing Cats are the primary host of the bug, also found in undercooked and raw meat, which lives in their brains and is passed to humans who are bitten or infected through cat litter. The message for cat owners is clear - there is no evidence that cats pose a risk to children's mental health Dr Francesca Solmi, from University College London Four years ago a study by the University of Michigan, based on data from a million people, found that more than 40 per cent who had suffered a cat bite went on to suffer from depression, although authors suggested possible reasons other than the parasite, such as that lonely people are more likely to have both a cat and symptoms of depression. Previous studies had suggested the parasite may contribute to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder and other personality changes. However this prior research often relied on asking people with and without mental health problems to remember details about their childhood, which were vulnerable to error. The UCL study looked at nearly 5,000 people born in 1991 or 1992, whose families were followed up until they reached the age of 18. WHAT IS T-GONDII? Toxoplasma gondii is a single-celled parasitic organism that can infect most animals and birds. Domestic felines are the parasite's ultimate host. When a person is infected, the parasite forms cysts that can affect almost any part of the body — often the brain and muscles, including the heart. If you're generally healthy, your immune system keeps the parasites in check. They remain in your body in an inactive state, providing you with lifelong immunity so that you can't become infected with the parasite again. But if your resistance is weakened by disease or certain medications, the infection can be reactivated, leading to serious complications. Source: Mayo Clinic The researchers had data on whether the household had cats while the mother was pregnant and when the children were growing up. The population looked at was larger than for previous studies, although it was not able to measure directly whether people were infected by the parasite. However the results suggest that if the parasite does cause psychiatric problems, then cat ownership does not significantly increase exposure. The study, published in the journal Psychological Medicine, could provide reassurance for mothers who are cat owners and concerned about their children. But physical health risks still exist for expectant mothers' unborn babies. Senior author Dr James Kirkbride said: 'Our study suggests that cat ownership during pregnancy or in early childhood does not pose a direct risk for later psychotic symptoms. 'However, there is good evidence that T. Gondii exposure during pregnancy can lead to serious birth defects and other health problems in children. 'As such, we recommend that pregnant women should continue to follow advice not to handle soiled cat litter in case it contains T. Gondii.'
