Garnett went back in time, explaining what made the 2007-2008 Celtics such a special group. The title-winning team had a closeness that Garnett—having played his entire career before that season in Minnesota—had never experienced. \n“We were like brothers,” Garnett explained. “We’d be arm-wrestling at dinner, talking stories…playing cards. It was a different feel. Now when I’m with Sam, Malik, you know Sam Cassell, Sprewell, we were like family, but it wasn’t like everybody. The whole team.” \nHere’s Garnett’s full answer: \"Anything is possible!\" \n— KG's Area 21 (@KGArea21) February 22, 2017 Advertisement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:52:41.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
