There is no conflict of interest, there is only convergence of interest,” he said at a press meet in Mumbai. \nSeshasayee also defended CEO Vishal Sikka’s pay package and said the compensation was related to a high level of target achievements. \nSeshasayee also said it is the job of the company’s board to listen to everyone. \nRead | Why Vishal Sikka has everyone’s support at Infosys \nThe press meet comes in the wake of Infosys founders, including NR Narayana Murthy, questioning the board’s willingness to be flexible with Sikka’s $11 million compensation. \nMurthy and other co-founders Nandan Nilekani and S Gopalakrishnan, had reportedly written to the Infosys board asking why Sikka’s compensation was raised and hefty severance packages offered to two top-level executives who quit the company. \nInfosys, however, has denied any corporate governance lapses, and has emphasised that its board is fully aligned with the strategic direction of Sikka and is very appreciative of the initiatives taken by him in pursuance of this transformation. \n(With inputs from agencies) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:29.372+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
