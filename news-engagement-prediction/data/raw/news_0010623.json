The last thing I want her to do is something potentially dangerous with surgery, so non-invasive liposuction would be the perfect solution.\" She showed off a slimmer figure in November (Photo: FameFlynet) \nLast year, Chantelle sparked concern after showing off a huge pout and dramatically bigger lips just days after having her lips plumped up again. \nAddressing the controversy at the time, she explained: \"I know thy look insane. They're settling down, but they were very swollen. People tell me I look like a fish and that I look ridiculous - 'trout pout', 'Donal Duck'... I get it all. But I like them.
