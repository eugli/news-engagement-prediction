NBA Australia \nPublished on Jan. 29, 2017 \nJan. 29, 2017 \nWith 6:00 minutes left in the third quarter, Paul George drove past his defender, going headlong into the teeth of the Rockets defense. With Clint Capela rising up to challenge the attempt, George saw no defender at all, cramming it home in a submission for the dunk of the year. \nMORE: NBA players potentially affected by Trump's new immigration order \nThe play extended the Pacers' double-digit lead as the home crowd at Bankers Life Fieldhouse rocked with energy. On the next possession, George hit a three-pointer, pushing the Pacers (25-22) to their eventual 120-101 win over the Houston Rockets (35-16), one of the Western Conference's elite teams. \nThe win gives the Pacers their third consecutive victory, quickly erasing the sting of their recent three-game losing streak. It was also the fourth consecutive game in which George scored 30 or more points, tying the longest streak of 30-point games in his career. \nBut while George's offense was on full display as he knocked down shots from deep and rocked the rim while crashing the paint, it was his defense that was the most critical for Indiana, as he hounded James Harden to just 3-of-17 shooting on the evening. Harden, who had scored 51 points on Friday against Philadelphia, finished the night well below his season average of 29.1 points per game. \nAside from George's defense, the Pacers were helped by yet another table-setting performance from Jeff Teague, whose game-high 15 assists had Indiana's offense breaking out in transition and moving the ball around the perimeter to the open man. \nThe bench received powerful boosts from Robinson III and Lavoy Allen, who each posted double-digits in the scoring column to keep Indiana's lead safe while Harden rested. \nThe victory is arguably Indiana's most impressive of the season, both because of the opponent and the final margin. After the game was knotted at seven, George hit a three-point shot to give the Pacers a lead that they didn't relinquish for the remainder of the game. \nIn the first half, the Pacers stifled the Rockets defensively, holding one of the league's best offenses to just 30.2 percent shooting. Harden, who sits at third in the NBA in scoring, was limited to 1-of-10 shooting through the first two quarters as the Pacers brought a 14-point lead into the halftime locker room. \nFrom the start, George stayed tethered to the hip of Harden, not allowing the MVP frontrunner any separation to create for his team on offense. With Harden effectively removed, the Rockets offense slumped while Indiana's soared, piling up 33 points in the first quarter to establish an early lead. \nIn the second quarter, the Rockets began to resemble the offense that has made them one of the league's most feared units. Houston whittled the deficit down to just six points, which only seemed to ignite Indiana's attack. \nFirst it was a lob to Robinson III who slammed it in with both hands. Then on a fastbreak, Teague evaded the defense with a deceptive dribble before lobbing one up for George, who thundered in a dunk to send the crowd at The Fieldhouse into a frenzy. \nThe electrifying plays allowed Indiana to end the half on a damaging run, scoring eight unanswered points and taking a 57-43 lead into the locker room. \nThe third and fourth quarters were more of the same for Indiana, as the Pacers managed to keep their lead near 20 points for nearly the entire second half. \nBy the time crunch time arrived, the Pacers were able to give their young players some run as the starters took a well-earned rest on the bench, watching as the team finished out its 19-point victory. \nHome Court Gift Shop Game Night Special \n50th Season Long Sleeve Tee - $16.
