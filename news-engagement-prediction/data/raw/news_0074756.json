Hosted by The Fader editor-in-chief Naomi Zeichner, the series look at the impact of music on television through interviews with the music supervisors for Girls , Stranger Things , Being Mary Jane , The O.C. and others. \nAnother series, Unpacked , will follow Broad City music supervisor Matt FX and Spotify Studios' Michele Santucci as they travel to music festivals around the United States, interviewing musicians, filmmakers, chefs and other creative people along the way. The series premieres March 14 starting at the SXSW festival in Austin. \nSpotify will also be the exclusive home to a podcast that explores the life and career of music industry executive Chris Lighty, who worked with 50 Cent, Missy Elliott, Puff Daddy and others. The series, which has the working title The Chris Lighty Story , will be hosted by Reggie Osse and feature commentary from Russell Simmons, Fat Joe, Warren G, Troy Carter and others. Produced in partnership with Gimlet Media and Loudspeaker Network, the series will premiere in April. \nLed by CEO Daniel Ek, Spotify has made a push to grow beyond its music streaming roots.
