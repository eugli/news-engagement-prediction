They do a lot for us.”\nThe Carseland fire hall has been at its current location for as long as anyone can remember and it was also built by volunteers , many even donated money to its construction.\nVander Velde says he and his colleagues were shocked to learn the fire hall was too close to the tracks and the costs associated with moving it.\n“It was a pretty big gulp but it had to be done,” he says. “We were under a directive that this had to be moved. There’s nothing wrong with this building.”\nThe county will be buying the old fire hall from the community for about $100,000.00 and that money will go toward building the new fire hall.\nIt’s hoped construction on the new fire hall will begin this fall.\nPhotos Conceptual drawing of Carseland's new fire hall\nThe graph showing how much money Carseland needs to raise to rebuild their fire hall", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:36:06.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
