USA TODAY Sports Susan Dunklee of the United States poses for a picture at the victory ceremony of women's 12.5km mass start competition during the IBU World Championships Biathlon 2017 at the Biathlon Stadium Hochfilzen on Feb. 19, 2017 in Hochfilzen, Austria. (Photo: Jan Hetfleisch, Bongarts/Getty Images) 12   \nThree years ago, biathlete Susan Dunklee watched as Lowell Bailey got his first World Cup podium. A week later, she did the same. \nSo when she watched Bailey win gold at the IBU World Championships on Saturday, she could only hope to repeat history. \nHer silver added to the Americans’ drought-breaking competition in Hochfilzen, Austria, giving the program momentum as it heads into an Olympic year. \n“I think part of it was just seeing Lowell break that ground and feeding off that positive momentum that the team gets,” Dunklee said. \nBailey won the men’s 20-kilometer race, making him the first American to win a biathlon world championship. The sport was the only Winter Olympics discipline in which the USA had not won an Olympic or world title, a drought that dated back to 1958 for world titles and 1960 for the Olympics. \nRELATED: \nA day later, Dunklee took silver in the women’s 12.5-kilometer mass start, making her the first American woman to win an individual medal. \nThey became the first athletes to qualify for the U.S. Olympic team. \n“For team morale, we’re at an all-time high, obviously,” said Bailey. “There is just this unbelievable feeling of optimism and the feeling that hard work and the coordinated efforts of hugely dedicated staff, that’s finally paid off.” \nAmerican Lowell Bailey celebrates on the podium after winning the men's 20km biathlon at the IBU World Championships in Hochfilzen, Austria on Thursday.

Last year, the veteran biathlete planned to retire after world championships. He and his wife, Erika, had loan papers waiting to be signed to start a grass-fed cattle business on her parents’ farm in Upstate New York. \nBut Bailey, 35, got a call from Crosscut Mountain Sports Center in Bozeman, Mont., seeking help fund-raising to build a facility. \n“That was an out-of-the-blue call that changed our lives,” Bailey said. \nBailey saw coaching as one of the few paths forward after retirement, but the opportunity to work with the center altered course. It meant he had to keep competing, though, so he and Erika decided they would travel together with their now 8-month-old daughter, Ophelia, rather than spend six months apart. \nBailey started preparing for the world championships in May, so by the time he lined up on Saturday, he’d had hundreds of dress rehearsals. He’d also finished fourth and sixth in the 10K sprint and 12.5K pursuit, respectively, before the 20K race. \n“It felt weird to be coming off some of the best races of my life and still wanting and wishing it could have been more,” he said. \nBailey shot clean in the competition and crested the final climb with about 800 meters to go when he could hear one voice rise above the crowd. It was Erika, who was wearing Ophelia on her chest, shouting that Bailey was winning. \n“It’s logistically challenging,” Bailey said. “It’s financially challenging, but I’m 100% sure that that’s the reason I was able to do what I did at world champs. \n“Having Erika and Ophelia there was really everything to me because I feel like they’re the reason … that I work as hard as I did and they inspire me to do that.” Facebook Posted!
