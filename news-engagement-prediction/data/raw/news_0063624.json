Mr. Schaller found that ridership in New York of Uber and other apps had tripled to about 16 million passengers in October 2016, from about five million in June 2015. Mr. Schaller is a consultant and said the report was an independent analysis to help inform the debate over for-hire vehicles. On the subway, annual ridership fell about 0.3 percent last year to 1.756 billion trips, according to the authority. But don’t celebrate roomier trains quite yet — the system is still teeming with more than six million riders on some weekdays. The new figures come at a time when both the subway system and Uber are facing problems that could influence how New Yorkers make transportation decisions. Subway delays have more than doubled in the past five years, and trains are more frequently breaking down. As riders fume over worsening service, on Thursday several members of the transportation authority board criticized Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo , who effectively controls the agency, for cutting $65 million in state aid to the M.T.A. in his executive budget. But Mr. Cuomo’s office has argued that overall state funding for the authority, including tax revenue, would increase by about $30 million. Officials at the authority said the funding changes would not lead to fare and toll increases or service changes. At the same time, some New Yorkers have deleted Uber over concerns that the company tried to profit during airport protests last month against President Trump’s immigration order, as well as the ties the company’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, had to Mr. Trump. This week, a former Uber engineer called attention to sexual harassment and other problems at the company , leading to more negative headlines. Uber has said it is investigating the accusations. One Uber user, DePaul Vaughn, said that after the airport controversy he deleted the app from his phone. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
