The reason the Pacers would consider dealing George now, according to a report from The Vertical’s Adrian Wojnarowski , is that the Celtics have also been linked to Chicago's Jimmy Butler. A trade for Butler would take the Celtics -- the team with the most to offer in a deal -- out of the trade market. \nThe Pacers, however, are also looking to make a trade to bring more talent to the roster to help George, Myles Turner and Jeff Teague in the second half of the season, which begins Friday against the Memphis Grizzlies. \nIf the Pacers do trade George to the Celtics, it would signify an abrupt change in their initial plans to build a team around their star player that could compete in the Eastern Conference. Instead, a trade sending George to Boston would start a rebuilding process around Turner, the Pacers’ 20-year-old phenom center. \nMultiple sources Tuesday told IndyStar the Pacers would not consider any trade discussion that involved George. \nIn January, Pacers President Larry Bird told IndyStar , “Before the year started, I told Paul, ‘Look, if you want to sign a long-term deal, we’re willing to do that max (contract) and if you want to wait, I understand.’ But this year, we’re not going to worry about it, we’re not going to talk about it and he’s going to make the decision that’s best for Paul when it comes down to it.” \nGeorge has made no public comments this season that he is favor of a trade. George said Friday on ESPN radio that he wants to lead the Pacers to their first NBA championship. But he also has made it clear he wants to see the supporting players that Bird surrounds him with before making a decision on a long-term contract. \n“As I told Larry, I always want to play on a winning team,” George said on the program . He later added: “Man, I want a chance to play for a chance to win a championship.” \nGeorge can opt out of his contract at the end of the 2017-18 season, which he is expected to do. \nThe Pacers can’t offer the new designated player exception – which allows a team to offer a sixth-year on contract extensions, an extra 5 percent of the salary cap (35 versus 30) and larger raises (7.5 percent versus 4.5 percent) – unless George makes one of the three All-NBA teams after the season. \nIn 50 games this season, George has averaged 22.3 points, 6.2 rebounds and 3.3 assists per game. \nIf the exception applies, the Pacers can offer George a contract worth roughly $212.3 million over six seasons ; another team could offer approximately $123 million over four. \nIf George is not traded, the Pacers’ best asset is their first-round pick. Bird is willing to trade the pick if it allows him to add another veteran who could help the Pacers in the playoffs. As far as acquiring talent, the Pacers have reached out to multiple teams to gauge who is available. \nIndiana entered the All-Star break last week on a six-game losing streak and currently holds the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference at 29-28. \nCall IndyStar reporter Nate Taylor at (317) 444-6484.
