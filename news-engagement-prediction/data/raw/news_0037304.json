Silvana Salcido Esparza of Barrio Cafe, Barrio Urbano and Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva in Phoenix has returned to the Best Chef — Southwest list for the fifth time, following a string of nominations in the first half of the decade. Jeff Smedstad of Elote Cafe in Sedona has received his first nomination, alongside Badman and Salcido Esparza. Sam Fox of Fox Restaurant Concepts is listed in the Outstanding Restaurateur category for the 10th year in a row. Chris Bianco’s restaurant, Pizzeria Bianco , has been nominated for Outstanding Restaurant for the fourth year running. FnB in Scottsdale has earned a nomination for Outstanding Wine Program, its first in the category. Phoenix’s Fry Bread House was honored by the foundation as one of America’s Classics in 2012, but Texas chefs have won the Southwest category five of the past six years. The last time an Arizona chef was honored was in 2007, when Nobuo Fukuda was recognized for his work at Sea Saw.\nThis year, three chefs made the list of 20 semifinalists in the Best Chef — Southwest category, derived from more than 24,000 public entries. About 600 judges across the nation will select the five finalists, who will be named on March 15 . The same judges will vote on the winners, to be announced at the James Beard Awards Gala in Chicago on May 1 .\nNominees' reaction Smedstad, on the cusp of his 10th anniversary at Elote Cafe, is thrilled to have received his first nomination and is excited that a smaller town like Sedona has caught the attention of the James Beard Foundation.\nChef Jeff Smedstad.

I’m blown away,” Smedstad said Wednesday morning. “Sometimes, it feels like we’re living on a little island up here, and it’s just amazing to be recognized. I’ve been cooking for 30 years, so this is definitely a highlight.”\nThe two trademarks at Elote Cafe are vibrant Mexican cuisine and lengthy lines of patrons who happily wait hours to sample it, testament to Smedstad’s reverence for Mexican food and culture.\n“Once I got down to central Mexico and southern Mexico, I thought the food was more vibrant than anything I was cooking in culinary school,\" he said. \"My career has been bent on trying to bring that out to more people and share it with them. I share postcards of my vacations, basically, on plates.”\nSmedstad joins Salcido Esparza, the revered chef and regular fixture on the James Beard nomination list, who was excited to learn she’d have some local company to represent her culture.\nChef Silvana Salcido Esparza   (Photo: The Republic) \n“Yay! Big high five to Jeff! Right on! I’m so glad to hear that, he deserves it,” Salcido Esparza said.\nShe has long worked to educate the public about Mexican food and culture. A nod from the James Beard Foundation can only help.\n“I said to myself, 'well, I’m getting old, and I’m going to teach these young kids how to do Mexican food my style.' I’m in great company, and I’m sorry that (Kevin) Binkley’s not there, but I’m sure he will be,” Salcido Esparza said.\nBinkley is a perennial nominee whose acclaimed Cave Creek restaurant, Binkley’s, was closed for much of 2016. Binkley retooled and relocated his restaurant, opening in Phoenix in December in the former Bink's Midwtown.\nFnB's Badman, another perennial nominee, was happy both about the nomination and the work it helps her do.\nChef Charleen Badman.

I’m pretty stoked. I can’t believe it.”\nMilic, who has long championed Arizona wines , feels FnB’s first nomination for Best Wine Program is as much for the state as it is for the restaurant.\nSam Fox has become a regular fixture in the \"Outstanding Restaurateur\" category for the James Beard Awards.

I’m just providing a platform where people can form their own opinions about what’s happening in Arizona with wine.”\nFox similarly deferred, crediting his staff for helping him earn his 10th consecutive nomination for Outstanding Restaurateur .\n“It’s awesome. It’s still great. It confirms all of the hard work everybody is doing in the organization,” Fox said. “They’re all working their ass off making me look good.”\nAnd Bianco, who has led Pizzeria Bianco to a fourth straight Best Restaurant nomination, captured a feeling expressed by all of his fellow nominees. His acclaimed new restaurant, Tratto, opened in Phoenix last May .\nChris Bianco's restaurant, Pizzeria Bianco, has been nominated in the \"Outstanding Restaurant\" category for the fourth time.

It makes us work harder and try to make things better every year.”\nThe full list of semifinalists can be found here .\nA previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nobuo Fukuda was honored with a James Beard award in 2006.
