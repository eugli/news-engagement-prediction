(Getty Images) \nUpdated at 2:16 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 2:16 p.m. ET \nThere’s no way to be certain if Kevin Garnett was hoping to create headlines with his assertion that the NBA is dying and his decision to frame the usual suspect, AAU basketball, as the lone assailant. He chose wisely, though. \nAAU basketball is such a convenient target for blame it’s a wonder this hasn’t spread beyond the boundaries of the sport. Like: AAU basketball is to blame for Beyonce not winning the best album Grammy. Or, AAU basketball is the reason it’s 65 degrees on Valentine’s Day in Indianapolis. \nMORE: Reggie Miiler blames millennials for lack of defense \nI mean, if you restrict AAU basketball merely to what Garnett said in an interview with NBA TV — “AAU has killed our league” — you’re denying its full potential. \nOf course, Garnett’s headline statement isn’t meant to be taken literally. The NBA’s popularity never has been greater, with primetime television games, star players who rank among the most popular athletes worldwide and television contracts so lucrative they can’t find places to hide all the money. \nHe is talking about specific concerns about the state of the game, and he may have a point, but blaming AAU for the decline he perceives is misguided at best and disingenuous at worst. \nThe full context of KG’s money line: “Our league is now at a point where you have to teach more than anything. AAU has killed our league. Seriously. I hate to even say this, but it’s real. From the perspective that these kids are not being taught anything. They have intentions and they want things, but the way they see it is not how our league works. You have to earn everything in this league. You’re not entitled to anything. And it’s more entitlement than anything.” \nIn fact, that is more or less how players have entered the league for nearly 22 years, since the NBA decided it no longer wished to pay premium prices for well-trained rookies and since a young man named Kevin Garnett — quite the coincidence — decided to enter the draft with no training beyond what he’d picked up in high school and, indeed, AAU. \nGarnett certainly is intelligent enough to understand that when he talks about poorly-trained players entering the league, he was the harbinger for all of them. He was the first American player for more than two decades to join the NBA directly from high school, and every preps-to-pros and one-and-done prospect since had his example to follow. \nIf players act entitled, it’s because they are. Washington point guard Markelle Fultz has been hearing all winter he will become the No. 1 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft even though UW might not win 10 games. NC State point guard Dennis Smith will be chosen not long afterward. His college coach just got fired because of the team’s poor performance. \nIt’s not AAU basketball that’s leading these players to be “entitled,” and it’s not the college game, either. It’s the NBA. That’s the level at which players aspire to be, and getting there in style no longer requires a great deal more than abundant talent. \nAs much as Garnett stood as an example to players seeking the quickest route to the league, this is far less to blame for that contagion than the league’s enduring addiction to the rookie salary cap. It seemed like such a clever idea to fix the wages of players entering the league to reduce holdouts and avoid monstrous entry-level contracts. But it also destroyed the incentive for players to enter the draft when they were more fully formed and capable of commanding high-dollar deals. And it reduced the risk for teams to gamble on pure potential. \nBefore the rookie cap, players in the early 1990s commonly remained in college basketball for multiple seasons to assure they were ready for the league’s elite competition and prepared to deliver value on contracts that paid them roughly three times as much as today’s rookies. \nThere always was the risk a player signed to one of those deals would become a bust. Now, NBA teams invest far less in their rookies — and get far less in return. From 1992-1994, 27 of the 30 players who were top-10 draft picks averaged double-figure scoring as rookies. From 2015-2017, it was only seven. \nAAU basketball is easily blamed for all of this, because the NBA is strong and popular, college basketball has been cut out of the equation and high school seems to have less influence than ever. But even the most active players in AAU play essentially three months of the year: April, May and July, and even then it’s largely on weekends. It’s not an inconsequential part of a player’s development, but it’s not enough to bear so much of the responsibility. \nThe current AAU structure, pioneered by Nike’s Elite Youth Basketball League (EYBL) and now adopted by most prominent competitions, has been more oriented toward team success and less to a culture of individual matchups. There is a value for exceptional talents getting the opportunity compete with and against one another. \nThe most valuable aspect of AAU basketball, though, remains its utility as a scapegoat for whatever one doesn’t appreciate about the direction of the sport. Blast AAU and most everyone will just nod along, and no one ever will get around to fixing what actually might be broken.
