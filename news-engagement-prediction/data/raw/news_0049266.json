The duo took the show by storm with their exceptional candour. \nWhile host Karan Johar heaped praises on Kangana, the episode began with him asking her to bear with the “unapologetic frivolities” of the show’s format. Kangana credited her success to KJo’s rejection and derision, the filmmaker constantly tried to make it up to her by saying he underestimated her ability as an actor. \nSaif Ali Khan, on the other hand, was a pleasant charmer throughout the episode. The actor, however, confessed that he isn’t as calm on the sets of his films. RT if you love Kangana’s unbridled candour! #KoffeeWithKangana pic.twitter.com/S5d4n1IsnB — Star World (@StarWorldIndia) February 19, 2017 \nAfter two serious sessions with the guests, the host moved on to a more raunchier segment, Koffee shots with Karan, whose primary focus was sex. The situational round had Saif and Kangana saying a “yes” or “no” by drinking coffee shots. \nThe segment was a revelation. With Saif’s confession of cheating on a partner and Kangana opening up about a lesbian encounter, it made for a controversial episode. \nThe much-hyped rapid fire round towards the end of the episode kept the momentum going. While both Saif and Kangana gave tough competition to each other, the coffee hamper went to the 29-year-old. In an attempt to form a new relationship, KJo congratulated Kangana on her KWK victory. A post shared by Shahid Kapoor (@shahidkapoor) on Feb 15, 2017 at 9:12pm PST \nAs the episode neared its end, Shahid Kapoor turned up to complete the Rangoon trifecta. Talking about his “simple” relationship with Saif and a “complicated” equation with Kangana, the 35-year-old definitely spilled some beans on the rumoured cold war that is brewing between them. \nYou can stream the full episode here Read more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:12:33.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
