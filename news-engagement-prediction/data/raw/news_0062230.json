(PTI) \nThe two-day talks between India and China failed to end deadlock between two countries on issues related to Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar’s listing as a global terrorist and India’s membership into the elite Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a report by ‘The Indian Express’ has said. \nForeign Secretary S Jaishankar said that even as China was “open to India’s application” for membership in NSG, and it was stuck to its “view of procedures and processes”, which is different from others in the grouping. He further said that India had informed its neighbouring country over its rationale on the listing of Azhar under UN 1267 sanctions committee, and added that it is being pursued by other countries — the US, the UK and France — and not only India. \nJaishankar’s underlying theme was that on both issues with Beijing, there was a “broad international support” for India’s case, but Beijing remained the lone roadblock. \nSpeaking to reporters in Beijing, Jaishankar said, “On the NSG issue, the Chinese side underlined that they were open to India’s application for membership but they had their view of procedures and processes, and these were somewhat different from where we are at the moment and where we think most of the group is at the moment.” \nOn the Chinese Foreign Ministry calling for “solid evidence” against Azhar Jaishankar said, “In the case of Azhar, Jaish itself is proscribed under 1267. So the proof is in (the) 1267 Committee action. In this case what he has done (and) extent of his actions are well-documented.” \nApart from this, the proposal was not moved by India, he said. “It is not that the burden of proof is on India to convince. The sponsors seem to be very well convinced, otherwise they would not have taken the initiative to move the proposal.” \nOn China suggesting that that there is no consensus on the issue, Jaishankar said there is no agreement “because China has not joined it”. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nSince the 1267 Committee proceedings are not public, he added, “Our understanding is that there is overwhelming support in the 1267 (Committee). This (is) what we are told. Other countries should be asked. The 1267 Committee is not for public. ” Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:36:32.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
