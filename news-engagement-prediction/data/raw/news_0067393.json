[Michael Schlow] Opening Alert Restaurateur Michael Schlow last night exported his brand of Italian dining across the river with the unveiling of Alta Strada in Fairfax County’s Mosaic District (2911 District Ave., Suite 150). The restaurant will be overseen by Matt Adler, the newly minted executive chef at Alta Strada and Casolare, and chef de cuisine Nicole Belverd, an alum of the Inn at Little Washington and Zaytinya. The 120-seat restaurant, designed by Edit Lab at Streetsense, debuts with a slate of dishes that should be familiar to those who’ve visited the Mt. Vernon Triangle location, including crunchy meatballs ($11), cavatelli with broccoli rabe ($18), and wine-braised short ribs accompanied by polenta ($28). Beverage director Chris Baliles has arranged a cocktail program featuring custom negronis, mules and effervescent punches. The restaurant opens for dinner nightly at 5 p.m.; lunch, happy hour and weekend brunch service are projected to follow in the coming weeks. Community Building Upscale diner Community Thursday is hosting it’s inaugural Founders Club Happy Hour. Curious parties are invited to poke their heads into 7776 Norfolk Ave. in Bethesda, Md., between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m to see what’s doing. “Enjoy a sampling of our craft cocktails, yummy bar bites and, of course, DONUTS — all on us!” management promises in an email blast. Potential attendees are encouraged to RSVP by Wednesday. Bird is the Word Chicken and beer is not just a rap album: it’s a way of life. Hence the reason 3 Stars Brewing Company has teamed up with celebrity chef Bryan Voltaggio for a “Fried Chicken Party” featuring crispy bird, frosty brews and specialty cocktails. Tickets to the informal feast — happening Feb. 28 from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. at 6400 Chillum Place NW — are $30 per person , which covers food, fixings and the first beer. The Shutter Adega Wine Cellars & Cafe closed over the weekend. The neighborhood spot, best known for its wine tastings and comfort foods (gourmet burgers and pizzas figured prominently), signed off with very little explanation. “Due to unforeseen circumstances, Adega will be closed indefinitely on February 19, 2017,” management said in a farewell note posted on the locked door. “”We thank all of you for your years of support and patronage!” In this Storystream", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:08:23.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
