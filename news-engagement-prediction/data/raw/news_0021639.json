(File photo) NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has castigated the government for failing to prevent terrorist attacks on security camps and installations, stating that it had not learnt any lesson from the Pathankot attack. Mentioning the attacks at Uri, Handwara, Nagrota, Pampore and Baramulla that took place much after the Pathankot strike of January 2016, the panel noted that there was an urgent need to beef up the security network and plug the gaps in intelligence gathering and sharing. The observation of the department-related standing committee on home affairs came despite the home ministry, in its action taken report on the panel's view expressing anguish over the \"grievous breach of security in Pathankot and Gurdaspur\", listed a long list of measures put in place to strengthen security at the border and counter infiltration in Punjab border areas. Among the measures listed by the home ministry are conduct of special operations along the border in in-depth areas, fabrication of 45 additional laser and intrusion detection systems for installation in Punjab; vulnerability mapping of border outposts along Indo-Pak border; sanctioning of pilot project for deploying technological solutions in two patches of 5-6 km of riverine gaps; and sensitive areas of Jammu frontier and upgradation of intelligence network and coordination with sister agencies. However, the reply of the government explaining the extra security measures taken in the wake of Pathankot attack was not accepted by the standing committee, which has former home minister and Congress MP P Chidambaram as its chairman. In a further recommendation in a report laid in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, the panel said: \"Despite the several steps reportedly taken by the government to strengthen the security measures, it has comprehensively failed to prevent recurrence of such attacks that took place at Pampore, Uri, Baramulla, Handwara and Nagrota. \"The committee observes that the government has not learnt any lesson from the Pathankot attack. The committee, therefore, recommends that there remains an urgent need to further strengthen the security network and plug the serious gaps in security establishment and intelligence gathering/sharing that have come to fore in the recent attacks.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T20:16:43.288+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
