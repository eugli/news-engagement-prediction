Gelisa Riddles, 28, of Delray Beach, was arrested Sunday for biting off the tip of a woman's finger during an argument over shoes. (Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office) Adam Sacasa police said.\nThe fight happened in the front yard of a home along the 100 block of Southwest 11th Avenue shortly before 8 p.m. on Feb. 15. Sharmeize Lillie, 47, of Delray Beach , told investigators that a woman she knows, Gelisa Riddles, 28, was in a chair on the lawn and attacked her when she tried to look behind her for a pair of shoes, an arrest report said. \nRiddles popped up from the chair, grabbed Lillie by the hair, bit her forehead and ---when Lillie tried to push her away--- chomped down on the index finger of her right hand, biting the tip off, Lillie told investigators. \nLillie was treated for her injuries at a hospital. When reached by telephone Thursday, she refused comment. \nIt’s not clear why the two women were arguing about the shoes or why the confrontation became violent. \nRiddles has a history of run-in’s with the law. State records show convictions in 2009 and 2015 on various drug, prostitution and theft charges. \nIn the current case, Riddles faces an aggravated battery charge and was being held in the Palm Beach County Jail on $20,000 bond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:12:31.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
