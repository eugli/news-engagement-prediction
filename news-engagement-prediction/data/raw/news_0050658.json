Photo by Martin San Diego/Rappler \n  Three women judges will handle the 3 drug-related charges filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) against opposition Senator Leila de Lima, the Muntinlupa City Regional Trial Court (RTC) announced Monday, February 19. \nDe Lima is facing 3 criminal complaints for allegedly violating Section 5 of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, which penalizes the \"sale, trading, administration, dispensation, delivery, distribution and transportation of illegal drugs.\" \nEach judge will decide whether there is probable cause to issue an arrest warrant against De Lima: RTC Branch 204, under Judge Juantina Guerrero, will handle the case against De Lima, former Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) officer-in-charge Rafael Ragos, and De Lima's former driver Ronnie Dayan (Criminal Case Number 17-165). RTC Branch 205, under Judge Amelia Fabros Corpuz, will handle Criminal Case Number 17-166, involving De Lima and her nephew Jad de Vera. Criminal Case Number 17-167 will be handled by the RTC Branch 206, with Judge Patria Manalastas de Leon presiding. Respondents for this case include De Lima, former BuCor chief Franklin Jesus Bucayu, Bucayu’s former staff Wilfredo Elli, inmate Jaybee Sebastian, Dayan, De Lima’s former security aide Joenel Sanchez, and De Lima’s nephew Jad de Vera. \nDe Lima immediately filed motions before the 3 branches, questioning the RTC's jurisdiction. \nDante Jimenez, chairman of the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC), which was one of the complainants in drug cases filed before the DOJ, went to the Muntinlupa RTC on Monday to observe the raffling of cases. \"We’re happy about this development. Despite some people's opposition, we must follow the rule of law,\" Jimenez said in a mix of English and Filipino. Senate rules on arrest Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III said that law enforcers had been briefed about Senate rules should the warrant of arrest be served against De Lima while she's inside the Senate. \"We go back to basic principles: no arrest during session, no arrest inside the Senate premises. But definitely, with the proper coordination with OSAA ( Senate's Office of the Sergeant-At-Arms) , it can be done immediately outside the premises,\" Pimentel said on Monday. De Lima's ally in the Senate, Liberal Party acting president Senator Francis Pangilinan said they are one with De Lima in questioning the jurisdiction of the regional trial court over her cases. Pangilinan clarified they will not be making any formal motion and will just support De Lima's own legal appeals. \"We are questioning the filing of charges before the regional trial court instead of the Ombudsman. We believe the evidence and testimonies against her are not credible, the testimonies who came from drug lords who have just been cleared of charges in connection to their illegal drug activity,\" he said in Filipino.
