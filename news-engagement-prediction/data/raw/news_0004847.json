Credit: ITV News \nDr Srivas Chennu, a computer scientist from the University of Kent who works with patients in a minimally conscious or vegetative state, said that the the more information doctors and scientists could get about the thinking or moods of their patients, the more those patients could have a say in their care. \nEven if their mode of communication was nowhere near as complex as a normal conversation, it would be immeasurably helpful. \nThose tantalising ideas are still many years away from reality, according to Prof Birbaumer. \nIt’ll take several more technological steps and will most likely need electrodes implanted into the brain, to read a patient’s thoughts more precisely than is possible with the optical sensors used until now by the Wyss Center team. \nBut that is the remarkable direction in which this profound work is heading.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:56:07.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
