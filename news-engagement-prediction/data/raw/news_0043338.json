The Federal Government Constituency intervention borehole project being constructed at the Community was facilitated by the Chairman of House Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, Honourable Oladipupo Adebutu. \nMr Wale Oshinowo, Ogun State Commissioner for Finance, who incidentally is an indigene of the community had led some hoodlums to the site in an attempt to demolish the project on the excuse that the contractor handling the project did not obtain proper approval before commencing work but he met stiff resistance in the people of the community. Mr. Oshinowo had to abandon the plot and flee the scene as many restive youths were threatening to mob him. \nSome residents of the community who spoke with our correspondent rained abuses on the commissioner and the APC government which they described as “insensitive and too destructive”. \nA community leader, the Oloritun of Ilugoke, Chief Aliu Fatoye wondered why a government that never did any project for the people of the community would find joy in destroying a project that is supposed to make life comfortable for them. \nAccording to him, “For the past six years, we have had issue of lack of water, APC government did nothing and now that Honorable Ladi has brought this project to our community, the state government wants to stop it. This is unacceptable.” He lambasted Mr Wale Oshinowo for choosing to be used to suffer his own people. \nMeanwhile, Honourable Adebutu has described the attempt of the Ogun State government to demolish the borehole project as wicked, childish and immatured. \nHe made this statement on Friday while addressing members of the community who had gathered to express their anger and displeasure on the act of the State government. \nThe lawmaker dismissed Mr Wale Oshinowo’s action as unfortunate and retrogressive. He said that the intervention project was to bring government closer to the people and improve the basic needs of the people. “This project is brought to the constituency so that the people, irrespective of their party affiliations, will have a sense of representation”, he said. \nThree of such intervention projects have also been cited communities in Sagamu and Remo North Local governments.
