While it initially looks like he's just serenading her, she soon joins in on the duet as the pair wax nostalgic about good times gone by. \nFilmed with retro lighting effects, the video hits that sweet spot between cute and ever so slightly unsettling. But if anyone can pull off a duet with a giant puppet in a video for a song about a bygone relationship, it's Chance.
