Murrow, who attacked Joseph McCarthy and his Communist witch hunts in an impassioned speech from 1954: “We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine and remember that we are not descended from fearful men.”\nHe then concluded with a quote from Cassius in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar : “The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.”\nIn an interview published earlier this week in the French tabloid Paris Match , Clooney spoke about director Roman Polanski, who stepped down as this year’s César Awards president amid controversy and planned protests from French feminist group Osez le Feminism.\nRead More: France’s César Awards to Proceed Without a President After Roman Polanski Withdrawal \nIn the interview (translated into French), Clooney said that “Polanski needs to put an end to this story so that it can finally be behind him.” He continued: “I don’t know enough about the Polanski affair to talk about it in detail. But what I understand is that he had an agreement with a judge and that the judge didn’t respect. I also know that the victim now supports him.” And he concluded: “When you think about all that this 83-year-old man has been through, it’s awful to imagine that they’re still after him.”\nThe honorary César Award has traditionally been handed out to Hollywood stars in the past years, with Michael Douglas, Sean Penn and Scarlett Johansson receiving the award during the last three editions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:13:50.202+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
