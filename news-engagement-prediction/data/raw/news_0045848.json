In fact in 2015, the amendments to Kelantan's Syariah Criminal Code 1993 was passed with the unanimous support of BN assemblymen, an act that was not criticised by Gerakan at all. \nThe Act 355 amendment, which may be debated in the upcoming parliamentary sitting, is a federal matter now, which is being taken over by the federal government that Gerakan is part of. \nDAP has no reason to resign from the Selangor government (as Ivanpal has suggested ) as the bill is being tabled in Parliament and not the Selangor state legislative assembly. \nAlso there was a major mandate given to DAP to be part of the Selangor government, compared to Gerakan (in the federal government) when it only has two parliamentary seats. \nAdmit Umno role in Hadi's bill \nGerakan has to stop denying that Umno has a hand in the current amendment which is also supported by Minister in the Prime Minister’s Department Jamil Khir Baharom, who also appeared in the recently concluded rally in Padang Merbok to support Act 355. \nGerakan and other BN component parties such as MCA, MIC and others should be ashamed that they’re subservient to ‘big brother’ Umno over this matter, which may just polarise the nation in the long run. \nThey should be collectively responsible over this whole matter. \nThe latest ‘romantic’ relationship between Umno and PAS has already proven how Umno treats its own allies in the BN. \nNevertheless, political parties such as Gerakan has been spineless all along, which caused them to get decimated to irrelevance in Penang back in 2008. \nSHAKIR AMEER is MBSA councillor and DAP Youth executive secretary (publicity). \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:41:14.758+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
