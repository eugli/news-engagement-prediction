The Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 – model number SM-G390F – will reportedly hit the shelves in early March when it will be available for purchase from retail partners for the price of €260-280. \nThe Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 has reached the headlines several times since January. Throughout the past few weeks, the device has been spotted in a couple of benchmarks too, namely GFXBench and Geekbench , where most of its characteristics have been unveiled. In any case, history shows that the Samsung Galaxy Xcover series accommodates dust and water-resistant mid-range smartphones, unlike Samsung’s “Galaxy Active” series designed to bring ruggedness to the premium market. With that in mind, the idea that the Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 will be launched in the 260-280 EUR price range is not unusual, and given that the previous model – the Samsung Galaxy Xcover 3 – was introduced in March 2015, a market release for the sequel sometime next month sounds fairly plausible. \nThe source also adds that the Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 will be available in black but makes no mention of other color options, so only time will tell if there will ever be one. As for the device’s specifications, according to previous leaks the ‘SM-G390F’ should house an Exynos 7570 System-on-Chip (SoC) integrating four Cortex-A53 CPU cores operating at 1.4 GHz, as well as a Mali-T720 graphics chip. The device should also make use of 2 GB of RAM and feature a 4.8 or 5-inch display with a resolution of 1280 x 720, all the while running Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. It’s also worth noting that smartphones in Samsung’s Galaxy Xcover series were usually treated with an IP67 certificate for dust and water resistance, however, given that many standard, non-rugged smartphones nowadays take advantage of an IP67 certificate, it remains to be seen whether the Korean tech giant will attempt to differentiate its device through increased ruggedness, or by adding more features designed for an active lifestyle. Either way, the Samsung Galaxy Xcover 4 is likely to adopt an industrial design language much like its predecessors.
