Metallic muse: Counteracting the chilly weather, the reality star wrapped her petite frame and blossoming bump in a padded metallic jacket Sky-high: Billie flaunted her toned pins in the thigh-grazing number as she sashayed to her bash in a pointed nude Christian Louboutin heel Dazzling display: The ITVBe darling dazzled in the ribbed knitwear dress that highlighted her buxom bust with its choker detail and scooped neckline The blonde beauty carried her Prada tweed overnight bag as she held her jacket closed while she accentuated her ever-growing stomach by tying her cosy coat's belt around her tummy. Joined by her other half, she worked her golden tresses into a soft wave, while sporting a dark smokey eye and nude lip. Decked out in all white, Sam put her best fashion foot forward as she donned a stylish suit for her sister's bash. The up-and-coming photographer slipped into a pair of skintight cigarette pants, which showcased her pert derriere and toned pins. She teamed her demure look with a belted blazer and stoned coloured body as she strutted out of her car in her pointed suede heels. Making a number of runs to her car, the mum-of-one let her glossy locks be tousled by the February breeze, while carrying her camera equipment inside. Sam recently revealed she gets a little help from her boyfriend Paul Knightley when it comes to clothing choices. In an interview with MailOnline alongside her sister Billie, Sam said: 'Paul loves fashion and he'll send me pictures of women's clothes and say, \"I like this\".' When asked if her beau was like Kanye West when he styles Kim Kardashian, Sam added: 'He really likes me in casual clothes, like a tracksuit. He's not as bad [as Kanye].' Billie said: 'We are both quite casual in the day. I am pregnant at the moment so I am wearing a different styles. 'Both our boyfriends love it when we are sexy. I still try to be quite glam and Greg [Shepherd] calls me \"Sexy mamma\" when I dress up. 'Greg is the opposite to Paul. He would never send me pictures because he just wouldn't know what to suggest. 'He compliments me and he wouldn't dare say I shouldn't wear something.' Billie got engaged to Greg in 2014 and they are expecting a brother for Nellie, two in a month. 'It's gone so quickly,' she said. 'I will be resting for the next two weeks, but when you already have a toddler, you're always on the go.' Sam has made no secret of her desire to tie the knot with Paul, they have a son called Paul Tony, aged one - but will she or Billie walk down the aisle first? 'Well Billie is engaged, so probably her...' said Sam. 'But you never know...' interjected Billie. 'We would never consider a joint wedding though as we wouldn't want to steal each other's thunder.'
