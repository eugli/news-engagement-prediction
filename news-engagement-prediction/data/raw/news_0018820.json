And their responses to his cancellation tweets are always pretty great.\n‚ÄúHigh school kids are clever and often very funny,‚Äù he told HuffPost. ‚ÄúI love our Bethlehem students, they are down to earth and just good kids.‚Äù\nRoy also explains that the reason why this particular cancellation is getting traction online is because his daughter, Jessica Roy, who works for New York Magazine and has a large social media following tweeted about it:\nit's time for my favorite thing about snow days: teens replying to my dad about school being canceled https://t.co/0dc8TwBMUf\n‚Äî Jessica Roy (@JessicaKRoy) February 9, 2017 And her followers adored the kids‚Äô responses.\n@JessicaKRoy this is so genuinely delightful, thank you\n‚Äî Nicole Chung (@nicole_soojung) February 9, 2017 Roy also says that all this positive energy surrounding his weather-cancellation tweets has helped strengthen his relationships in his district.\n‚ÄúIn this big district, kids now know who their superintendent is through Twitter,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo when I visit schools they have a connection. That‚Äôs cool.‚Äù\nBut they may not think he so cool after HuffPost asked him whether or not there would be school on Friday. ‚ÄúYes! It‚Äôs been sunny all day. Roads look good,‚Äù he said.\nBut, for all the Bethlehem students out there reading this, there is still a glimmer of hope. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt ruled out a delayed opening if roads freeze up,‚Äù Roy said.\nFingers crossed!\nAlso on HuffPost NYC Snowstorm NYC Snowstorm 1 of 15 Share this slide:\ndenisesantoro1/Instagram More: U.S. News Arts And Entertainment Twitter Power Of Humanity Huffington Post Suggest a correction Comments On a budget?
