Someone already destroyed Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and the sign at the Trump National Golf Course in Rancho Palos Verdes, CA. \nDave Aronberg , the State Attorney who handles Palm Beach prosecutions, tells TMZ Trump's political leanings have no bearing on his decision to prosecute vandalism cases. Aronberg is ensconced in the Democratic Party, but says his job is to follow the law, and that is what he will do. \nAronberg says there's no room for political statements when it comes to vandalism. If anyone vandalizes Mar-a-Lago they will be treated as a criminal, and not a hero.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T11:32:38.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
