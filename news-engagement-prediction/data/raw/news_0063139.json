Denver needs to add a new starting left tackle after declining to pick up Russell Okung’s option. \nWhitworth (6-7, 330 pounds) is a 35-year-old veteran with three Pro Bowl selections on his resume. Though he appears willing to return to Cincinnati, Whitworth would like to play for a contender , according to Alex Marvez of Sporting News. \n“At this point in my career it’s about the challenge, the excitement of trying to win that Super Bowl . . . hopefully it’s in Cincinnati,” Whitworth told Marvez on SiriusXM NFL Radio on Monday. \nAfter being selected in the second round out of LSU in the 2006 NFL draft, Whitworth has started the last 11 seasons with the Bengals. Starting in all 16 games last season, Whitworth allowed zero sacks, according to STATS . \nThe league’s 2017 free agency signing period will begin March 9.
