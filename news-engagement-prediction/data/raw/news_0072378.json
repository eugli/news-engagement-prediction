Violence, 2. Fear, and 3. Intimidation - and at each element the ‘terrorists’ who carried out the daylight kidnapping of Feb 13 has met its objectives, to inculcate fear and intimidate peace loving and law-abiding Malaysians. \nThe kidnapping of the pastor has already gone viral and world leaders and diplomats are anxiously watching its developments therein, as it will certify whether we are after all, a moderate country and followers of a Federal Constitution which paved the way for a peaceful transition and independence from our colonial masters in 1957, or slipping into anarchy engineered by a rogue group, certainly with a political and religious agenda, out to wreck whatever our founding fathers achieved? \nThis is why I am appealing to dear friends, the no-nonsense tolerating home affairs minister and deputy prime minister, the competent and passionate inspector-general of police and his team, who are truly professionals to address and allay the fear and anxiety that has gripped minorities and especially Malaysian Christians, following this violent act of terror, exerted by a team of highly-skilled, competent, committed, dedicated, passionate, highly-motivated and financed team of actors. \nI pray this is not the alpha of a secular nation with laws, and with a proud history of governance entering a period of summary judgments, death squads, kidnappings and terror by a clandestine group of actors/terrorists? \nMay the Almighty help us as we cry out in helplessness to Him. \nDR JACOB GEORGE is president, Consumers Association of Subang & Shah Alam, Selangor (Cassa). \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T17:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T12:46:12.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
