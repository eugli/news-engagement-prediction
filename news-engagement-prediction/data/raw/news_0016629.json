This post contains spoilers for Santa Clarita Diet. Santa Clarita Diet faced one creative challenge right from the beginning: How could the show make it look like Drew Barrymore , playing a suburban realtor turned ravenous undead creature, was chowing down on raw human flesh? The Netflix series, which premiered Friday, is not the first show to depict cannibalism—but it may be one of the most graphic. Luckily, the show’s Make-Up Effects Designer, Christien Tinsley, is not one to shy away from a challenge. “The thing about Drew is, Drew doesn’t eat meat,” Tinsley said—meaning that whatever she ate on the set would have to be vegetarian. So when it came time for Barrymore to, say, gnaw on what appears to be a human foot, Tinsley’s team crafted what was essentially a foot-shaped gummy bear. The team used “all kinds of different things” in its mix, Tinsley said, adding various colorings and painting them with candy pigments and dyes. Then, the edible parts were attached to a rubber piece, so Barrymore could “pull on them and tug at it” as though she were struggling to eat a real piece of human flesh. Yum! This was no new task for Tinsley: he’s got 20 years of experience, research, and books collected and stored for just these purposes. He’s also got what’s called a “morgue” of images, compiled from a wide variety of resources: medical research books, forensic pathology books, various people he’s come across over the years, and, of course, the Internet, which Tinsley noted “has become this absurd resource where you can find pretty much anything.” “The odd part of the job I do is trying to explain to people I haven’t seen too many bodies shoved into a freezer and chipped away at with hammers and chipping stones, so this is my best guess,” he added with a laugh. In developing effects for scenes that involve Barrymore gnawing on a foot, or feasting on one of her colleagues or neighbors, Tinsley said the goal isn’t always to simulate what the gory deed might actually look like—sometimes, it’s actually more about capturing what viewers might imagine the scene would look like. “You look for that one element, and sometimes we’re looking for a feel. It may not always be exactly what happens in death or in dismemberment, but we always try to play with that line of cinematic design, as well: what would look impressionistic of what people think it would be. . . It’s always a morbid process getting to that point.” Going into Santa Clarita Diet, Tinsley wasn’t sure exactly what approach the show would take: were he and his team working to juxtapose some seriously visceral gore against comedic dialogue, or would the series have a lighter touch? (For example, he wondered, “Is the blood going to be less red and more light pink? Are we going to see the violence, or is it going to be more implied?”) As anyone who has watched even the first episode of Santa Clarita Diet knows, the series definitely took the first approach , leaning into realistic gore as much as possible—and using it as just one more element of absurdity to push its humor over the top. “I was shocked at how willing they were to push forward with something that in most cases for a television show, they would have pulled back on,” Tinsley said. “They pushed those boundaries back much farther than I expected. . . I didn’t have to be as restricted as I usually am.” That's no small compliment from a guy who’s worked on gory tales like Westworld and American Horror Story. So, what other effects did the team have to cook up? (Here come the real spoilers. ) The blood used throughout the show was actually a special formula developed for Tinsley’s company, rather than the typical corn syrup formula used in many films and TV productions—which, though, cheap, tends to be sticky, bleed, and attractive to bugs. As for the fleshy elements—for instance, the human fingers Barrymore’s Sheila carries in a snack bag—those are made from silicone, which is somewhat translucent, Tinsley noted, so it “looks and feels and photographs like flesh.” One scene that took much more work than you might imagine? The one in which Sheila and her husband Joel ( Timothy Olyphant ) have to push an un-lidded storage container filled with the remains of smarmy real estate broker Gary ( Nathan Fillion ) across desert sand as the goopy viscera within sloshes around. “That, as simple as it was, took us about two and a half weeks of research and development,” Tinsley said. Why? Because the container would be heavy—potentially way too heavy for two actors to push if it were really filled to the brim with fake blood. A few possible solutions were considered: a teflon coating for the bottom of the container, or placing a track underneath it, for instance. Ultimately, the team made sure the body parts inside were filled with airbags to keep the weight down. And the containers’ bottoms were built with slants to reduce the amount of liquid required to make them look full. The kicker? To make sure they wouldn’t need to clean up and rearrange the containers between takes, the team had to produce four tubs of viscous viscera. “That was a much harder effect than I would have ever have thought going into it,” Tinsley said. And then there’s Dan ( Ricardo Chavira ), Sheila and Joel’s annoyingly suspicious cop neighbor, whom Joel kills by accident. In a hilarious set of sequences, Joel and Sheila find themselves dragging Dan around, trying to hide his body from the police. Eventually, the two hatch a plan: Sheila can eat him before the cops turn up in the morning. Unfortunately, even after a night of binge eating, Sheila finds that there’s just way too much meat on Dan’s bones to finish in one sitting. Those scenes took months and months of preparation. The team literally had to make a duplicate of Chavira—which involved inspecting, touching, and photographing every inch of the actor, whom Tinsley complimented for being a “trooper.” They ended up with a dummy that looked and moved like a person—one that could be dragged, thrown over a fence, folded, collapsed, seated—but weighed half as much as an actual body. Of course, Dan isn’t the only unlucky victim Sheila eats. There’s also Gary, whom Sheila makes her first victim in she and Joel’s own back yard. Fillion, Tinsley said, brought up a concern most male actors broach when the subject of having a full nude double made of them: “The question always comes around to the, ‘What’s my junk going to look like’—referring to the male anatomy, Tinsley said. “In this case and other cases through the show, we decided that Drew's character—for reasons we didn’t need to explore—decides to eat the ‘mid section’ quite quickly. There really is no reason as to the why but regardless, the issue of what it was going to look like or ‘how big will it be’ didn't matter. It was going to be consumed before the audience ever gets to see it.” Ah, the joys of Hollywood. Tinsley noted that the scene in which Sheila tries to eat Dan overnight in the bathroom might not be out of place in a Quentin Tarantino film—but in this show, the comedy is distinct. “You put on Drew Barrymore coughing up a piece of hair . . . suddenly, it’s something completely different.” And “different,” as it happens, is probably the best one-word description for Santa Clarita Diet itself.
