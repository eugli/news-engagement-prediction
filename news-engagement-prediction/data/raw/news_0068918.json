However, even as they agreed that they were anxious about travelling to the US, they confessed that the lure of the fat salaries on offer there was too hard to turn down. \n\n\"If the choice is between security and money, the latter always wins,\" said techie Ekalabya Patnaik, a member of the city-based Forum of IT Professionals. \"These unfortunate incidents do affect us deeply. It feels like we have lost one of us. But while we do feel a sense of fear, it doesn't deter anybody from latching on to the first opportunity that comes their way from the US. It's where the future lies,\" he added. A few techies drew a comparison between the salaries on offer in India and the US, saying that while a staffer with 10 years of work experience draws Rs 12-20 lakh annually in India, they earn upwards of Rs 50-60 lakh per annum in the US. \n\n\"Such occurrences aren't new; they have been happening for years. But that hasn't impacted the footfall of professionals and students from here to the US,\" said Ramesh Loganathan, a former president of Hyderabad Software Enterprises Association. \n\nEstimates suggest that 40% of India's IT business dealings are with the US. Considering the mammoth population of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh techies living in the US, it isn't tough to guess that the two states contribute significantly to that figure. \n\nBut the threat is all too real for Indian professionals based in the US. \"My brother, who recently moved to Dallas ... has been receiving warning letters with messages such as 'go back to your country'. Other Indians in Dallas have also received similar notes,\" techie Pavan Komaragiri said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:51:46.455+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
