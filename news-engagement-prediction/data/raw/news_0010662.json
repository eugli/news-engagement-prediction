Coca-Cola offers to double-match its employees’ individual donations; the soda titan donated $117.3 million in 2015. Home Depot prioritizes in helping veterans, and has improved 2,500 homes for vets since 2011. \nVolunteer rate: 15% \nIncome donated: 1.8% An 8-year-old practices reading a book to a golden retriever in a program called Paws to Read in Alexandria.\nKatherine Frey/The Washington Post via Getty Images \nSix miles from downtown Washington, DC, Alexandria is, by some standards, the charity capital of America. The nation’s three largest charities—United Way, the Salvation Army, and Catholic Charities USA—are all based here. For a city with a population of less than 150,000, there are 1,300 public nonprofits, covering fields like disaster aid, military family service, and global child welfare. \nWhile its proximity to Washington doesn’t hurt, the fact that Alexandria is among the wealthiest cities in the country certainly has something to do with its residents’ generosity. The median household income in Alexandria is $89,134, almost 65% higher than the national median. \nVolunteer rate: 10.5% \nIncome donated: 2.9% \nWithin days of the Louisiana floods last summer, truckloads of bottled water, dry food, and clean clothes were already making their way to Baton Rouge from Birmingham. The same community-wide response also helped Birmingham get through disasters ranging from the 1873 cholera epidemic to the 2011 tornadoes that swept through the state. \nBirmingham is located in the heart of the Bible Belt, and its inhabitants’ charitable impulses are influenced by a religious sense of duty. More than half of its population read the Good Book regularly, according to the American Bible Society. The altruism is needed here, since almost one-third of the population lives in poverty. \nVolunteer rate: 12.5% \nIncome donated: 2.1% \nNestled in Central Oregon’s river valley and surrounded by lush forests, the outdoor lifestyle in Oregon’s Emerald City not only breeds sociable folks but also a number of conservation-minded charitable organizations. A perfect example is Northwest Youth Group, a job-training program that educates young people who risk falling through the cracks, and teaches them life skills through nature conservation work. \n“Eugene has an enormous number of nonprofits. People who are supporting nonprofits don’t just support one, but three to eight organizations at the same time,” says Natalie Whitson , development officer of Northwest Youth Group. \nSocial equality is so close to hearts in Eugene that it’s written into the city government’s guidelines. Rural Development Initiatives, an economic development group, was formed in response to the downturn in farming, helping to provide badly needed financial assistance and job training.
