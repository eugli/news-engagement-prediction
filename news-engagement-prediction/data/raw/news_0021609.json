Reason? \nCPF & MOM have not done anything since 3months ago and not a single cent being paid from this ex-empolyer till today. He is still happily travelling scot free! \nEveryday this poor employee has been calling CPF Board & MOM but nothing has been done. MOM advised him to file a Writ Of Seizure against the ex-employer! What a joke! Since there are so many awareness campaign going around why is the outcome of complaints being handled in such a manner? I really hope the outcome will be favorable as this poor employee has outstanding unclaimed expenses of more than 20k plus default in 3months salary and CPF. \nArticle published in The Straits Time April 1, 2014 at 8.32am SGT.
