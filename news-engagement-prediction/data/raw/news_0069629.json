I no longer have to worry about my granddaughter’s safety.” \n\nShe continued, “I would like to thank the U.S. Marshals and the Tallahassee Police department. \n“They worked tirelessly to bring justice to my family. I would also like to thank my family and friends for keeping me sane in the midst of it all.” \n\nT-Pain shared his reaction to the murder of his niece last fall via Twitter, saying their family needs privacy and will stop at nothing to find her killer.
