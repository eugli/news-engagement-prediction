The Croat was soon patched up and able to continue. \nToni Kroos whipped a deep free-kick into the Espanyol area and Morata clipped it over the crossbar, but the offside flag had already gone up. \nOn the half-hour, Ronaldo was put clear into the right side of the area but his low shot across the face of goal was touched behind with Morata ready for a tap-in at the far post. \nFrom the resulting corner, Ronaldo thought he had put Real Madrid in front but his finish at the near post was ruled out for offiside. \nReal Madrid’s pressure eventually told as they took the lead in the 33rd minute. Isco was given time on the right to look up and send over a looping cross, which Morata dispatched into the bottom corner with a flying header. \nEspanyol remained under pressure as the first half drew to a close, with Morata blocked by David López as the striker looked set to slot in a second. \nOn 55 minutes, Ronaldo shaped up for a free-kick in a central position 25 yards out, but could only hit his effort into the wall. \nEspanyol thought Hernán Pérez was through on goal after getting the better of Varane on the edge of the Real Madrid penalty area, but the referee called the substitute back for a handball in the tussle, which looked somewhat harsh. \nWith 20 minutes left, Bale replaced Morata, to make his return after 88 days on the sidelines. \nBale gave the home fans just what they wanted after being released by Isco into the left channel, where he held off Pérez’s last-ditch challenge before slotting the ball into the far corner past Diego López from a tight angle after 82 minutes. \nIn stoppage time, Ronaldo looked to have been bundled down by Aaron Martin as he arrived at the far post, but instead the officials called up incorrectly for a offside.
