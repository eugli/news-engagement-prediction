IndiaToday.in | Edited by Shreya Biswas A + A - Zealandia. Source: Twitter \nEverything that you learned about the world having seven continents might be going out the window soon, thanks to Zealandia. \nWhat is Zealandia, you wonder? \nWell, it is this vast stretch of landmass near Australia that is almost completely submerged in the southwest Pacific. Researchers are of the view that this landmass \"qualifies as a continent\". \nSo, if everything goes right, we might soon have Zealandia approved as a brand new continent. \nHere are a few things you must know about Zealandia: In 1995, American geophysicist Bruce Luyendyk gave the name Zealandia to this south-west Pacific continent for the first time. New Zealand geologist Nick Mortimer, along with other scientists, published a paper in the Geological Society of America's Journal today, calling Zealandia \"distinct enough to constitute a separate continent\". The GSA report says that Zealandia is around five million sq km in size. That would be about the same size as the Indian subcontinent. Almost 94 per cent of Zealandia is underwater in the Pacific Ocean. It encircles New Zealand, New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, the Lord Howe Island group, and also the Elizabeth and Middleton reefs. As it so happens, New Zealand's North and South Islands, and New Caledonia are actually parts of Zealandia. These are the few bits of the landmasses that remains out of water. Despite being mostly underwater, Zealandia meets all the criteria to be qualified as a continent: it is elevated above the surrounding area, has distinctive geology, well-defined area, crust thicker than the usual ocean floor, etc. It is believed that Zealandia sank some time between 60 to 85 million years ago, after it broke away from Gondwana, the landmass that Australia was once a part of. Geologists have been researching and pitching for Zealandia to be recognised as an independent continent for over 20 years now. If approved, Zealandia will become the world's seventh and smallest continent, joining the crew of Asia, Europe, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, and Australia. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T13:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:48:20.537+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
