(Peter Thomson / AP) Andy Nguyen \nShe said people in direct contact with a bat are at risk of being bitten and may not even realize it because their teeth are so small â€” even a superficial wound could still transmit the rabies virus. \nDespite the danger, Middleton said there has been no reported case in the county of a person contracting the virus from a bat. And only one to three such cases are reported annually nationwide. \nIf a person or pet does come into contact with a bat, she said they should immediately get tested for rabies. People should also refrain from touching a bat in any way, even if it's found lying on the ground. \n\"If a bat is found flying inside a home, the room it is flying in should be vacated to prevent contact with it,\" she said. \"Live bats found inside homes should not be let out unless it is certain that no one was in contact with it.\" \nPeople are encouraged to call their local animal control agency in the event that they encounter a bat.
