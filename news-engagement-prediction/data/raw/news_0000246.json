I think your military is scared. Our military isn’t, so I just might send them down to take care of it,” Mr. Trump said, according to the debunked report. \nThe AP’s description of the transcript doesn’t contain the Mexican president’s response or indicate the tone or context of Mr. Trump’s remark. \nBut reporting on the call has nevertheless fueled online headlines and social media commentary that portray Mr. Trump’s comments as a threat to invade Mexico. \nOne Mexican website, Aristegui Noticias, described Mr. Trump as humiliating the Mexican president, an allegation Mexico’s foreign relations department said is based “is based on absolute falsehoods.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:38:24.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
