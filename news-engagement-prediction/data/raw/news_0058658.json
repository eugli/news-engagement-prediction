A post shared by Kayla Itsines (@kayla_itsines) on Feb 11, 2017 at 9:32pm PST \nPearce, 24, was found with four tablets of Cabolin, a brand name for the drug known generically as cabergoline, when he was stopped by police in an alleged reckless driving incident in Black Forest, in Adelaide's Inner South.

A post shared by Kayla Itsines (@kayla_itsines) on Nov 30, 2016 at 7:54pm PST \nIt is not Pearce's first brush with the law on the road. Last July, it was reported the Bikini Body CEO's $500,000 Lamborghini Huracan had become a viral sensation after it was spotted - and shamed on social media - while parked in a variety of disabled parking spots in Adelaide. \nPearce did not confirm if he had a disabled parking permit at the time. \nAs for Itsines, the social media fitness queen (she has more than six million Instagram followers) has remained quiet about the incident, posting her usual slew of motivational quotes and before-and-after pictures to her social media channels without pause for comment.
