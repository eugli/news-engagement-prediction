This translates into less time, effort and costs consumed by watering, fertilizing and insecticide use. \nLikewise, native Missouri wildlife has evolved to coexist and use native plants for cover, food and habitat. So increasing native plants also tends to increase desirable wildlife, like birds, butterflies and pollinators. \nThe Partners for Native Landscaping Reception and Workshop for Landowners is part of MDC’s commitment to work with homeowners to sustain healthy and greener communities for both people and wildlife.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:58:25.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
