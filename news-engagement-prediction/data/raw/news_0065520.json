He is 5’10” and weighs about 150 lbs. He has short, dark brown hair and speaks French.\nSome fraud prevention tips from Montreal police:\nDo not lose sight of your bank or credit card Handle your card yourself when paying for the trip If you do lose sight of it, always ensure the driver gives you your own card back Personalize your credit card by, for example, placing a sticker or other distinctive sign on it Anyone with information that can help identify and locate the suspect should contact Info-Crime Montreal at 514-393-1133.
