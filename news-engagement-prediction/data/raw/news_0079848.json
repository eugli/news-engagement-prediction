Credit: PA \nLibel proceedings have begun against controversial newspaper columnist Katie Hopkins over tweets a food blogger say accuse her of supporting the vandalism of a Second World War memorial. \nJack Monroe, who also campaigns over poverty issues, is reportedly suing Hopkins for £50,000 , over claims she was \"defamed\" by the former Apprentice contestant. \nThe High Court hearing relates to a Twitter posting Hopkins made in May 2015 during a debate on the social media site after a memorial to the women of the Second World War in Whitehall was daubed with the words \"F*** Tory scum\" during an anti- austerity demonstration. \nWading into the debate Hopkins - who has 680,000 followers on Twitter - posted: \"@MsJackMonroe scrawled on any memorials recently? Vandalised the memory of those who fought for your freedom. Grandma got any more medals?\" \nMonroe says the tweet meant she had either vandalised a war memorial, and \"thereby desecrated the memory of those who fought for her freedom and had committed a criminal act\", or that she \"condoned or approved\" of the criminal vandalisation of a war memorial.

Credit: PA \nThe 28-year-old, from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, also claims that a second tweet by Hopkins bore a \"defamatory innuendo meaning\" that she \"approved or condoned the criminal vandalisation of the women's war memorial in Whitehall during an anti-government protest\". \nHer lawyer William Bennett told Mr Justice Warby: \"The claimant's primary case is that by reason of the seriousness of the allegations and the scale of publication, serious harm to reputation has been caused. \n\"A widely published allegation that someone has either vandalised a war memorial or approved of such an act will inevitably cause serious damage to reputation.\" \nMr Bennett said \"the libel was a particular affront to her because part of her identity is as a member of a family closely involved with the armed forces\". \nMonroe, who has more than 87,400 Twitter followers and runs a food blog, initially demanded Hopkins apologise and donate £5,000 to a charity supporting migrants. Katie Hopkins has 680,000 Twitter followers. Credit: PA \nWhile Hopkins, who has previously likened migrants to \"cockroaches\" in a column that generated international condemnation, deleted the tweet, she failed to offer an apology. \nMr Bennett continued that even after Hopkins deleted her tweet \"she did not apologise or retract the allegation even though she knew it was false\". \nJonathan Price, for Hopkins, told the judge in written argument that her case was that \"this relatively trivial dispute arose and was resolved on Twitter in a period of several hours\". \nHe argued that \"no lasting harm, and certainly no serious harm\", to Monroe's reputation resulted from it. \nMr Price said her case was that \"these proceedings are an unnecessary and disproportionate epilogue to the parties' otherwise forgotten Twitter row\". \nHe continued that Hopkins had \"mistakenly\" used Monroe's Twitter handle, instead of that of another columnist who had tweeted about the memorial incident. \nMr Price added that the \"novelty\" of the case was that \"the publications complained of and the harm particularised all took place on Twitter\". \nSorry, this content isn't available on your device. \nMonroe rejected Mr Price's suggestion that rather than it being the worst thing to happen to her on Twitter, which was her evidence, it was in fact the best thing because it gave her the opportunity to bring the proceedings. \nShe told the court: \"These proceedings have been a nightmare. It has been an 18-month, unproductive, devastating nightmare. \n\"I did not want to be here today. I have offered several times though my lawyer to settle these proceedings outside court. This is the last thing that I wanted to be doing.\" \nThe hearing continues on Tuesday.
