Backlogs at immigration courts have delayed hearings for more than a year. \nThe provisions also allow federal authorities to prosecute the parents of unaccompanied minors who enter the country illegally if they are found to have paid smugglers. \nImmigrant rights groups have expressed concern that the new policies will lead to widespread enforcement raids and abuses by federal authorities as they seek to ramp up deportations of the nation's 11 million immigrants without documentation. The memos are intended as an implementation blueprint for DHS to follow through on three executive orders Trump signed in January to pursue construction of a border wall, beef up patrols along the southern border with Mexico and escalate enforcement inside the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:53:13.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
