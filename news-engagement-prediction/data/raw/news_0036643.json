This fire-spewing drone is probably nothing to worry about \nHe was facing prison time when he pleaded guilty to the offence but the judge claimed it had not reflected his ‘true character’. \nJudge Alexander Horneman-Wren said: ‘You had many distressing family insults that resulted in a number of unfortunate events and one particular tragedy was used in quite a horrible way by your peers to bully you which might provide some context about how this matter came about. \n‘You were the subject of quite horrible harassment.’ \nHe was sentenced to two years probation and avoided jail.
