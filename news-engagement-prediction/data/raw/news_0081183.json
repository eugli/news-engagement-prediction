They include: Australia has one of the best healthcare systems. In the UK, the NHS is deteriorating, while in the US the mandated healthcare insurance has not turned out well for wealthy and middle class patients. Australia’s location makes it a good base for doing business in emerging Asian countries such as China, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Vietnam and India. Australia is relatively immune to the turmoil in the Middle East and the related refugee crisis in Europe. Australia was recently rated as the safest country in the world by New World Wealth. Australia is a particularly safe country to raise children. Australia is a good base for wealthy retired yacht owners who wish to sail the South Pacific Islands. Australia has lower inheritance taxes than the US and much lower inheritance taxes than the UK. Lifestyle: wildlife, beaches, scenery. \nNew World Wealth says Australia’s superior economic growth over the past decade has no doubt had an impact on confidence and business opportunities. \nOver the past 10 years, total wealth held in Australia has increased by 85% compared to 30% in the US and 28% in the UK. \n“The average Australian is now significantly wealthier than the average US or UK citizen, which was not the case 10 years ago,” says New World Wealth.
