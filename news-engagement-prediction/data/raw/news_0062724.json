recently arrested 17-year-old Orlando David Delgado who is charged with shooting and killing a bald eagle with two of his friends.\nA resident in North Harris county said he heard a \"loud pop\" near his home and observed three males standing near a tree where the symbolic bird had nested for a few years.\nSURVIVING TEXAS: How to stay safe vs. the Lone Star State's biggest threats\nWhen the witness approached, he saw the eagle's body and dialed 911-- but not before the three males nabbed one of the eagle's feathers and took off in a white colored truck.\nAfter identifying the vehicle, police arrested the teen, who told them he shot the eagle several times with a high-powered Gammo Pellet rifle.\nThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service chose not to prosecute Delgado due to his age, authorities said. Instead, Game Warden H.R. Volschenk of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department charged the minor with a class A misdemeanor for hunting without a landowner's consent.\nREPEALED: Endangered Species Act may be heading for the threatened list\nClick through above to see endangered species of Texas.\nPhotographer Tasha Hall captured the incredible moment her family helped save a bald eagle trapped in a hunterâ€™s snare on January 26.Hall wrote that she had been on a snowmobile expedition in Kootenays, British Columbia, to photograph moose when she stumbled across the stricken eagle. The video shows they freed the eagle from the snare and used a jacket to calm and restrain the injured raptor. CTV News reported that the eagle was treated for dehydration and a wing hematoma at the BC Wildlife Park, and staff hoped the bird can eventually be released back into the wild. This video shows the rescue.
