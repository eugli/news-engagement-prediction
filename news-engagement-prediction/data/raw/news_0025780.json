And by the sound of it, he never will. Marshall’s problem doesn’t seem to be with Brady. It’s seems to be a quarterback thing. \nThe floor is yours, Brandon… \nVia NJ.com : \n“He’s not the best player ever,” Marshall said. \nOK, not the hottest of takes. Sure, Brady has a good argument for being the best, but there are many other reasonable choices, including Joe Montana, Jerry Rice and Jim Brown. \nContinue on… \n“We get caught up in that whole discussion, that when a quarterback is playing really well, he’s probably the best in the business, and we think he’s the best player. And that’s not true. When I think about [a] player, I think about a guy that I can put at corner, safety, defensive end, a guy that I can put back on punt return, chase down kicks.” \nUm, Brandon, that player has literally never existed. Defensive ends aren’t also playing corner and returning punts. \n“That, to me, is the best player. J.J. Watt, that can play defensive end, tight end, put him at tackle, make him lose some weight and he can probably play linebacker and safety. That’s the best player.” \nWait, so now J.J. Watt is the greatest of all-time? I’m very confused. Sure he has caught some touchdowns in his past, but he’s still only a defensive end. A very good defensive end, sure. He may very well go down as the best ever. But just because he played another position a few times does not make him any greater than the best player at the sport’s most important position. \nMarshall threw some other names out there, too. \n“I would put J.J. Watt in that discussion. I would put Reggie White in that discussion. I would put Deion [Sanders] in that discussion. I would put Jerry Rice in that discussion. That would probably be impossible [to pick one].” \nAll fine choices, but those players, save for Sanders, also played only one position during their careers. So if you are using the versatility argument against Brady, you can’t then go out and pick other players stuck playing one position. \nBrady may or may not be the GOAT, but he’s certainly in the discussion, and Marshall seems to have an odd take on what it takes to be the best player ever. Let’s just all agree to never ask him this question again. More NFL!
