Variety also reported that Kristen Wiig is lining up to star, with Adam McKay set to produce along with Wiig, Will Ferrell and Jessica Elbaum of Gloria Sanchez Productions. \nAde also commented that she was looking forward to seeing Jack Nicholson in the role. \n“I mean Jack Nicholson is one of the best actors that has ever been alive. I have to say there are so many films with him that I love so much,”Ade said. “It’s also surreal that someone else is playing the role because it’s like introducing a new father to me… but I actually think I will enjoy sitting and watching a remake of ‘Toni Erdmann.'” Filed Under: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T03:39:52.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
