He is not welcome, the family hate him. Heaven help him if he turned up. \n“Fadi was not really his boyfriend. No one has spoken to him and he just seems to be getting on with his life. It makes my stomach turn.” George Michael's chidlhood friend, Andros Georgiou (Photo: BBC) \nThe Ambulance Service are currently probing the release of the 999 call at the weekend made by Fadi upon finding George’s body. \nThe Sunday Mirror told how George’s family condemned the leak of the audio in a statement \n“George’s family and friends are extremely upset and truly appalled that such a personal, painful and clearly confidential recording has been leaked to the media,” the family’s lawyers. \n“On their behalf we will be ensuring that a full investigation takes place to establish how this material was made available and we will expect the culprit(s) to be dealt with appropriately. \n“We firmly believe that anyone contacting the emergency authorities in situations such as this should be entitled to expect that recordings will not be released to the media and it is deeply distressing to the family that this transcript, and audio recording, has been made public.” \nCops are treating George’s death as unexplained but non-suspicious. They are preparing a report to the Oxfordshire Coronor and have quizzed Fadi twice in order to put it together. \nThe Mirror has previously revealed how Fadi claimed to have slept the night in his car on Christmas Eve – leaving George to die alone.
