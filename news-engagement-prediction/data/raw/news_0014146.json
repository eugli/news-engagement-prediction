He and other bookmakers said there was such strong action on both teams that the line hasn’t moved off three points since it was first set nearly two weeks ago. \n“We’re pretty balanced, with 53 per cent of the money on the Falcons,” Simbal said. \n“It seems like everybody else is in a similar position, too.” \nPODCAST!

That was in line with the 10 per cent books charge bettors as the vigorish, or “vig” as it’s known in the industry. \nBettors can wager on hundreds of so-called props, or proposition bets at most books that include everything from who will win the coin flip to whether the game will go to overtime. \nThe props have taken on a life of their own in recent years, with books trying to outdo each other with new offerings. At the William Hill string of books, one punter wagered $US500 that the Patriots would score exactly 46 points. The odds against it were 150-1, meaning the ticket would cash for $US75,000 if it hit. \nAnother wager was $US100 someone put on there being no touchdowns in the game at 500-1 odds, which would pay off $US50,000. \nVaccaro, who has been running sports books in Las Vegas since the late 1970s, said he can’t remember a Super Bowl where there was almost no movement on any of the lines. \n“This is as good as it gets for us,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:32:39.020+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
