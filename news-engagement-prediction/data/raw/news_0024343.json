I dance in a troupe based in Stoke-on-Trent called Crystal Shandelles, and they danced for Collettes in Oldham .

No amount of money can bring her back but I thought it would be one less thing Kirsty would need to think about. \n“No one should have to bury their child, or worry about how they can fund the best send off their baby deserves. \n“Money shouldn’t have to be an issue at a time like this. However they choose to spend the money I would be happy knowing I’ve been able to do a little something for my friend and her family through this heartbreaking time.” \nOn Sunday Crystal Shandelles released more than 100 balloons into the sky in memory of the youngster. \nTo donate, visit www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/Layla-rose-x ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:47:07.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
