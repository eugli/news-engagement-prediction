Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Rep. Chellie Pingree (D-Maine) introduced legislation that would standardize date labels and food donation laws. They're expected to reintroduce the bill in the coming weeks. In mid-December, the USDA also published nonbinding guidance that encouraged manufacturers to switch to the \"Best if Used By\" phrasing. \nThis all delights Broad-Leib, who made similar policy recommendations in a 2013 report with the Natural Resources Defense Council. According to NRDC, Americans throw away $218 billion worth of food each year. The anti-food-waste coalition ReFED estimates that 398,000 tons, or $1.8 billion, could be saved through standardized date labels. \nOf course, that is just a drop in the waste bucket: To make a real dent in America's food waste problem, Broad-Leib said, more will have to be done. The Food Law and Policy Clinic is arguing for several federal interventions, including policy changes that make it easier for companies and farms to donate food and incentives to encourage them to do so. (Some of this appears in the Food Donation Act of 2017, which Rep. Marcia Fudge , D-Ohio, introduced a week ago.) \nBroad-Leib would also like to see the Department of Agriculture designate more funds for local composting and anaerobic facilities, as well as education campaigns for consumers. The Natural Resources Defense Council and the Ad Council are currently running one such campaign, called \"Save the Food.\" \nAfter all, Broad-Leib points out, if Americans don't understand food waste, the new labels won't help. And ultimately, neither will anything else. \nCaitlin Dewey is a food policy writer for the Washington Post. \nMORE BUSINESS NEWS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:09:19.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
