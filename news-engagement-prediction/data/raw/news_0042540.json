The company introduced the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz SHVS in India on 1st September, 2015 and later in October, 2015 expanded its Smart Hybrid range by launching the Ertiga SHVS. The Maruti Suzuki Ciaz SHVS has a certified fuel economy of 28.09 km/l, while the Ertiga SHVS delivers ARAI rated fuel efficiency of 24.52 km/l.\nSHVS is a technology which uses an Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) and an advanced high capacity battery that supplies power to the engine. The SHVS technology is more fuel efficient than the conventional set-up as it saves energy when the drivers decelerate or apply brakes. This is done when the driver shifts the gear lever to neutral and releases the clutch while the engine is idle. The engine stops automatically and restarts when the clutch is pressed. The saved energy is used in the process. The saved energy then helps the engine during acceleration, thus, improves the fuel efficiency of the vehicle by preventing wastage of fuel. When braking or decelerating, ISG charges the battery and provide energy to the engine's idle start-stop function and helps the engine during acceleration.\nSince the Government of India has extended the incentives under the FAME (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric) scheme, many car manufacturers in the country are introducing more hybrid and electric vehicles. These also include upgrading of products to End of Life Vehicle (ELV) norms of Europe, adoption of BS-IV and E-10 compliant engines and the introduction of factory-fitted CNG vehicles with i-GPI technology. Maruti Suzuki has sold around 6 lakh alternate fuel vehicles and 1 lakh Smart Hybrid vehicles cumulatively, which, in turn, has reduced about 4 lakh tons of CO2 emissions cumulatively.\nCelebrating the success of SHVS sales, R S Kalsi, Executive Director, Marketing & Sales, Maruti Suzuki said, “As we move towards hybrid and electric cars, we see this as a first important step in this space. Both Ciaz SHVS and Ertiga SHVS are high on fuel efficiency, come with reduced running costs and lower levels of CO2 emission, thus making these popular among customers. The response we have received for SHVS equipped Ciaz and Ertiga encourages us to continue to invest in new technologies that support the environment while benefiting the customer.”\nAlso read: Best car Discounts in India in February 2017 on Maruti, Hyundai and Tata vehicles\nWith the introduction of SHVS vehicles by Maruti Suzuki, the company was able to reduce 15 percent of the CO2 emissions. This has been made possible through various initiatives such as improved fuel efficiency, new technologies and development of alternate fuel products. The company's model lineup, including the Alto 800, Alto K10, Celerio, WagonR, Eeco and Ertiga are offered with i-GPI CNG engine technology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:15:31.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
