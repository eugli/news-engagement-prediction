From there, police say, the scammers recommend more tree work and home improvement jobs — charging elderly victims for services barely performed or never performed.\n“People who just don’t know what they’re doing. They have dementia. They’re trusting,” Montgomery County Circuit Judge Robert Greenberg said from the bench last week. \nBank surveillance photos were used in building a case against Ryan Butler. The tattoo on his neck reads: Virginia’s Finest. (Montgomery County State’s Attorney’s Office) He then sentenced one of the crew members, Ryan Butler, 26, to seven years in prison.\n“To take advantage of them, sir, I can’t give you any mercy,” Greenberg told Butler, adding, “You just don’t do that in a civilized society to elderly people.”\nGreenberg was scheduled to sentence two of Butler’s associates Wednesday.\nWhile sentencing Butler, the judge allowed that on some level, he could comprehend how someone might rob a middle-aged person. But to target the elderly — given how many people have seen their own parents age and become vulnerable — was something that left the judge struggling for words.\n“What would possess somebody to take advantage of an 80- or 90-year-old person is just beyond me,” Greenberg said.\nThe cases against Butler and his associates date back to early 2015 and involve an operation that called itself two names, printed on each side of its business card: “Our Family Tree Service” and “Our Family Home Improvement.”\nIn February 2015, according to Montgomery County police reports, the daughter of the 94-year-old man called police to her father’s home in the Colesville area, about four miles north of the Capital Beltway. Detectives reviewed the victim’s checking account records and the work that was purportedly done.\nAround that time, a similar call to police was made by the daughter of the 82-year-old woman, according to court records. Detectives determined that over a four-month period, starting in November 2014, the victim had paid nearly tens of thousands in purported tree work and home improvement, according to police records.\nMontgomery Police Lt. Mike Hartnett said the schemes are on the rise.\n“These suspects are well-known among fraud investigators throughout the region as ‘woodchucks,’ ” Hartnett wrote in a report about the case.\nHe said the frauds grew out of more well-intentioned efforts of Virginia-based crews to offer tree service after storms.\n“Over the last three years, there has been a prolific increase in cases — not associated with weather events — that have drawn ‘woodchucks’ to the region primarily to defraud elderly victims, using the tree business as cover,” Hartnett wrote.\nThe crews “then migrate towards home improvement fraud by alluding that other issues were found while doing the tree work such as chimney repair, missing roof shingles, leaky attics, damaged insulation, rotting wood or perceived ‘emergency’ roof repairs. Very rarely were [any] of those cases legitimate.”\nButler, the defendant sentenced last week, had earlier pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy to exploit money from a vulnerable adult. A deal with prosecutors limited his sentence to seven years. His attorney, Melanie Creedon, spoke Friday about his rough childhood and his early drug use — using marijuana by age 12, crack cocaine by age 14 and heroin by age 17.\nButler spoke briefly in court as well.\n“I do apologize for the crimes I committed. I know it doesn’t make it right,” he told the judge, saying he intended to pay restitution to the victims. “I just ask that you have a little bit of mercy. I’m just trying to get home to my daughter.”\nMontgomery County Assistant State’s Attorney Jessica Hall told the judge that, at one point, one of the victims was charged $2,300 for insulation that was valued at no more than $100. “The victims are, each and every one of the three of them, either vulnerable in a physical sense or vulnerable in a cognitive and mental sense,” she said. \nThe two defendants expected to be sentenced Wednesday also are linked to Our Family Tree Service and Our Family Home Improvement.\nSteve Frazier, 62, earlier pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy to exploit money from a vulnerable adult. He faces up to five years in prison, according to court records.\nKim Butler, 50, earlier pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit theft. She faces no jail time but five years of probation, according to court records.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:33:15.243+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
