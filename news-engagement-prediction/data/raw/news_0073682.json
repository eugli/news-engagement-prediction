What was on the cards was what would be a remarkable victory in arguably the most inhospitable touring conditions in world cricket. The visitors completed the win soon – by a humongous 333 runs – even as Indian fans were left thoroughly disheartened after watching their own batsmen gasp for breath in the dust bowl. \nThis was a clear case of India receiving a dose of their own medicine, in their very own backyard. It was also a classic example of one’s strength turning into one’s biggest weakness. \nSuch was India’s spineless capitulation that it surprised even the man who had orchestrated it. Australian captain Steven Smith , who ‘thought it was going to be hard work’ was handed a victory inside three days of test cricket. \nSo, how did India’s 19-test winning streak finally snap? \nThe Indian spinners, who had done no wrong this season, missed out on few key tricks in Pune that their Australian counterparts were quick to catch on to. \nThe proven and tested left-arm off spin of Ravindra Jadeja failed to make any impression on a rank first day turner. Jadeja didn’t do the thing he does best: bowl the ones that skid off the track. He, thus, ended up spinning every delivery and gave no room to the surprise element contained in a straight-on variation. \nOn the contrary, his counterpart, the slow left-arm orthodox bowler from New South Wales, man-of-the-match Steve O’Keefe, reaped the benefits of the odd ball that held its line. \nO’Keefe’s verbal volleys too had as much spite as his performance on field. Before the start of the series, he had been quick to issue a stern warning to Team India . \n“They are a class team, they are exceptional batters at home and it’s going to be a big job. But I have got no doubt if we get it right for sustained longer periods then we can do some damage.” \nIn fact, strangely enough, the fact that Australia’s spinners were turning the ball to a lesser degree than India turned out to be the differentiating factor between victory and defeat. \nIn India’s second innings, skipper Virat Kohli played for turn, but when the ball held its line, he saw it crashing into the stumps. \nEven more hurtful to India’s cause was Kohli’s poor judgment of when to opt for DRS during Australia’s batting. It can be safely said that here it was the overenthusiasm of the man behind the wicket – Wriddhiman Saha – that bled India, so much so that the review quota was exhausted in the first few overs itself. \nThis hasty approach was not confined to just the captaincy. \nThe Indian batsmen seemed to be in a particular hurry when their turn came. Across two innings, they batted for just 73 overs, even as the Australians played the waiting game and ground out India’s bowlers. The lowest point of the match was when the home team lost 7 wickets for 11 runs in the first innings. \nSo, the wild predictions of a 4-0 series defeat to Australia have been snipped in the bud. In a way Australia have paid India back in the same coin, for it were India who had terminated the Aussie’ magnificent 16-match unbeaten run nearly two decades back. \nNow that Kohli’s air of invincibility has taken a hit, what lies ahead? As much as learning to win, India’s captain needs to learn to lose. As was evident from his post-match presser, where he said he would take the defeat “on the chin”, Kohli looks to have wised up already. \nWith three more Tests to go, Australia will underestimate Kohli’s wounded tigers at their own peril. @YahooCricket on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Matches ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T11:33:51.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
