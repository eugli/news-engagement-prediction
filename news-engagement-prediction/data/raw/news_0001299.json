As she handed him an energy drink, she said, “Don’t flirt with the female customers and don’t talk with the female part-time workers.” \nShe confessed during her interview, “There has been an increase in women who are taking an interest in him [Sleepy]. Though it makes me a little green with jealousy, it also makes me feel good because he’s getting more love.” \nLee Guk Joo also added, “People tell me that they’re envious of us and we make them want to get married. When they ask for photos, they want to take it with both of us, and that makes me feel good.” \nDuring his time at Lee Guk Joo’s restaurant, Sleepy worked hard to keep up his wife’s reputation, and she watched over him with a proud expression on her face. The comedienne stated, “He was very careful with the customers. I didn’t have to worry about him because he did so well on his own.” Sleepy revealed that he felt a lot of responsibility, as if the restaurant was his own. \nCatch up with the latest episode of “We Got Married” below!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T16:50:17.658+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
