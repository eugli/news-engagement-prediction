They’re offended, damn it, and they want everyone to know about it.\nYesterday the Bureau released its judgments on three separate ads, where all the complainants accused advertisers of promoting a culture of bullying.\nFor context, the true definition of bullying is “the repeated and habitual use of force, abuse or intimidation against others”. Examples include making threats, spreading rumours, attacking someone physically or verbally, and excluding someone from a group on purpose.\nOf course these three ads - for sunscreen, road safety, and car insurance - do none of those things.\nIf you’re looking for reassurance that you’re not an uptight loser with no life, take a read through these ridiculous complaints and the Bureau’s hilarious, dismissive responses.\nAD NUMBER 1: FROM ALDI, PROMOTING SUNSCREENA \nA man with a noticeably sunburnt face opens the boot of his car, and a loaf of bread talks to him, telling him he should have used sunscreen. The loaf of bread says he is “pink as a littlelamb cutlet”, and refers to him as a “shiny, shiny lobster face”.\nThe Complaint: “Where there is such emphasis on bullying in society I find the final comment ‘shiny, shiny lobster face’ made to the man is condoning bullying and is not something that should be promoted.”\nThe Board’s Response: \n“The Board noted that the man in the advertisement is referred to as a pink lamb cutlet and a lobster, which is a temporary condition caused by the man himself, and considered that these comments, made by a computer animated loaf of bread, are clearly in the context of the man not using sunscreen.\n“The Board considered that the advertisement is humorous and lighthearted and in the Board’s view the unrealistic, fantasy situation would not be seen as bullying rather as humorous.”\nAD NUMBER 2: FROM THE ROAD SAFETY ADVISORY COUNCIL \nThe whole point of the ad is to differentiate between “mates” and a “real mate”, with the message being that “real mates” don’t let you drink drive. It shows a series of situations where the “mate” and “real” mate are pitted against each other.\nThe final scenario shows the mate indicating his friend shouldn’t drive after drinking, but the “real mate” takes the car keys from him and drops them down the drain so he definitely cannot drive. The final onscreen text reads, “Real mates don’t let mates drink drive”.\nThe Complaint (it’s long, but it’s worth it): \n“These ads show a real mate tickling his friend while he is lifting weights. This is tremendously dangerous as the friend could drop the weights smashing his face or worse breaking his neck. I would hate to see a young person copy the actions in this add (sic) and hurt his friend and possibly ruin his own life as well.\n“Firstly it is sexist. Women would never be depicted in such a negative manner, even though they have an increasing problem with alcohol abuse. Secondly, the so called “good mate” repeatedly demonstrates bullying behaviour, such as pushing a meat pie into his “mates” (sic) face.\n“Thirdly, he drops his mate’s keys into the drain. This looks like a full set of keys, probably including the house keys. Imagine the problems this would create. He could have just pocketed them. You can bet your boots that some of these behaviours have been copied because the ad says it’s OK.\n“I have not had a problem with earlier campaigns as they made the point without being offensive or negatively provocative.\n“If the drunken mate was a woman, would it be OK for the same guy to drop her keys down a drain, or to push a meat pie into her face? Let’s drop the double standard that says it’s OK to take the piss out of men but not out of women.”\nThe Response: \n“The Board noted in particular the scene showing a man dropping his friend’s keys down a drain and considered that while this is not behaviour to be encouraged, in the Board’s view the slapstick nature of the advertisement lessens the impact of this behaviour and it is relevant to the important community message regarding not drinking alcohol before driving a vehicle.\n“The Board acknowledged that the cumulative effect of the behaviour of the ‘real’ mate could amount to bullying behaviour if this were to take place in the real world but considered that in the context of an advertisement trying to highlight the role of a ‘real’ friend in order to promote an important community message, the advertisement does not depict, promote or encourage bullying behaviour.”\nAD NUMBER 3: PROMOTING CAR INSURANCE COMPARISON SITE Comparethemarket.com.au \nIt involves a meerkat, who is interrogating a man hooked up to a lie detector. He’s grilling him about how he offers such cheap insurance prices, and if he ate all the office biscuits.\nCompare The Meerkat: Office butter bandit ad 0:30 Is time for get more answers from Tom.
