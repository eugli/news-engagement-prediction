The biggest thing, and I may be a bit redundant when I talk about this, but it is about their character, about their leadership,\" Stoops said. \"You look at these guys and a bunch of these guys are captains on their football team, they're very, very good students. They're competitors, they're winners.\" \nAnother trait that stuck out to Stoops was his commitments' commitment, noting that the Cats didn't lose a single player's pledge from the beginning of the 2016 season onward. \nJust as important, though, was riding the wave of momentum UK created with what recruiting coordinator Vince Marrow described as a \"signature win\" over Louisville in the season finale. \n\"When we first got here, we were selling a dream and what it was gonna become. Facilities, all that. You're still selling the SEC, but eventually, we had to win that signature game to make them say, 'Whoa, OK. Everything they're selling now is coming true.' I can tell you this, when our coaches went out in December, I had a lot of people telling me our coaches were walking into schools with a swag and everybody was talking about that Louisville game,\" Marrow said. \"To me, that win was huge. I mean, I can't even say how big that win was. It was huge for us.\" \nAs a result, doors were opened in new areas. Ohio was once again a cornerstone of UK's class, with seven 2017 signees hailing from the land of the Buckeyes, \"but we had to branch out,\" Stoops said. The Cats added players from states like Maryland and Oklahoma, and after not signing a player from Florida last season, Stoops gave a shout out to offensive coordinator Eddie Gran for making inroads down south, where UK picked up eight commits â€“ the most from the Sunshine State since Stoops' first class in 2013 (10). \n\"I wanted to get back South Florida, Florida in general, but I wanted to get some players out of South Florida,\" Stoops said, \"and Eddie has such strong relationships down there and did a phenomenal job. But also touching on the six other states that we did, that's kind of what we've been doing, and it was nice to see us have a lot of variety there.\" \nThe class wasn't without its misses, though. Local star Jedrick Wills cemented his commitment to Alabama. While Wills may be one that got away, Stoops said he and his staff won't stop fighting to get top flight talent to Lexington.

I think half of you laughed at me,\" Stoops said. \"But that's not going to stop. And we're not going to win them all, but we're going to win our fair share, and we're competing and we're fighting to get the very best players we can, and this group included. There's quite a few options that these players could have gone, and I'm happy they chose us.\" Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:44:27.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
