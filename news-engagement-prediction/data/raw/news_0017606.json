Do n she goes. Picture: Tom Pennington/Getty Images/AFP Source: AFP \nAnd then: One giant leap. Gaga hurled herself from the rooftop, dropping out of the camera’s sight and apparently plummeting some 79 metres to the pitch below. \nThe camera then cut to the view inside the stadium — and there was Gaga, plummeting on wires towards a platform where she’d land and, in just seconds, start her hit-packed medley. \nBut here’s how it happened: The opening rooftop section — and the start of that leap — was prerecorded way back on January 30 . That shocking ‘leap’ into the stadium was filmed in advance (and whenever it was filmed, Gaga most likely landed in a net just below shot). \nAn audience-filmed video obtained by TMZ shows the view inside the stadium just before the camera picks up Gaga’s ‘plummet’: She’s instead stationary on the wires, awaiting her cue once the prerecorded vision of her fall has aired. Have a look: — NFL Brasil (@NFLBrasil) February 6, 2017 \nSo why the prerecord? \nIt’s understood that weather played a part — the success of the opening sequence hinged on the effectiveness of the glittering drones, so it made sense to nail that ahead of time rather than risk bad weather conditions on the night. \n“In February, you don’t know what it will be like during Super Bowl day. We’d hate to plan all this and, if the wind speeds are too high or if it’s raining and the roof is closed, no one can see this spectacular show,” Intel Drones general manager Natalie Cheung told USA Today. \nCheung said there were other logistic issues to take into account. Turns out leaping from the top of a stadium and starting your first song on the ground approximately eight seconds later is a feat beyond even the likes of Lady Gag \n“Lady Gaga also was on the roof when this was filmed, and from a logistics and creative perspective, it’s a bit hard for her to go from the roof all the way down to the floor of the stadium,” she said. Gaga’s plummet from the stadium roof was a perfect illusion. Picture: Bob Levey/Getty Images Source: Getty Images \nSo there you have it. Lady Gaga didn’t jump off the stadium roof and Santa Claus isn’t real. \nStill, Gaga did deliver an undeniably incredible show — and performed all her own stunts, including this badass ‘mic drop’ of a closing shot: LADY GAGA MIC DROP pic.twitter.com/uzYodh0vGI — Steve Noah (@Steve_OS) February 6, 2017 \nNailed it. photo gallery Super Bowl 2017: Lady Gaga’s epic half-time show Lady Gaga performs during the Pepsi Zero Sugar Super Bowl 51 Halftime Show at NRG Stadium on February 5, 2017 in Houston, Texas.
