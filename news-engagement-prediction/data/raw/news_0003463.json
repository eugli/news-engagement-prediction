'The images featured in the book are known as callotypes, which rely on a photographic negative.\n'Therefore the images have remarkable detail and convey a lot of the exotica that Thomson was fascinated with.\nThe travelogue features images of China from the 1870s, and were taken by John Thomson, who travelled 5,000 miles across the country\nThe photographer spent 10 years travelling around the Far East and is a pioneer of photojournalism\nThe travelogue will go on sale in New York next month, where it is expected to fetch around £20,000\nThe photographer visited remote regions in China, where many had never seen a Westerner before\n'The images are very intimate - one set shows women's different hairstyles - and convey the stories and experiences that he had.'\nThomson learned about photography during an apprenticeship under a scientific instrument manufacturer, and left his native Edinburgh for Singapore in 1872.\nHe spent 10 years travelling around the Far East documenting the its people, landscapes and artefacts.\nThe fascinating photo collection includes images of beggars, Mandarins and princes from Thomson's five years travelling across China\nThomson photographed a broad range of subjects in his five years in China\nIn China, he travelled from the southern trading ports of Hong Kong and Canton to the cities of Peking and Shanghai, the Great Wall in the north and deep into central China.\nThomson's travels in China were often perilous, however, as he visited remote regions. Most of the people he encountered had never seen a Westerner or camera before. He carried a bulky wooden camera, fragile glass plates and potentially explosive chemicals.\nHis images range from humble beggars and street people to Mandarins, princes and senior government officials, and from remote villages and monasteries to Imperial Palaces.\nIntimate portrait shots taken by Thomson on his travels show the unique hairstyles of Chinese women in the 1870s\nAn image of Chao-Chow-Fu bridge was among the scenes captured by the Scottish photojournalist\nThe fascinating images give a unique insight into life in China around the 1870s\nThomson returned to the UK in 1872 and published his work the following year.\nIn his introduction, Quote: : 'My design in the accompanying work is to present a series of pictures of China and its people, such as shall convey an accurate impression of the county I traversed as well as of the arts, usages, and manners which prevail in different provinces of the Empire.\n'With this intention I made the camera the constant companion of my wanderings, and to it I am indebted for the faithful reproduction of the scenes I visited, and of the types of race with which I came into contact.'\nThomson later became a portrait photographer of High Society in Mayfair, and was appointed photographer to the royal family by Queen Victoria in 1881. He died in 1921, at the age of 84.\nTwo men producing tea in China during Thomson's travels is one of the images which feature in the travelogue\nWorkers weighing teas for exportation in one of Thomson's images\nA Canton tea house features in the collection of images which goes on sale on February 14\nA tea tasting room in the 1870s was one of Thomson's subjects in the fascinating travelogue\nThe travelogue was purchased by a 19th century American socialite, and passed through her family for more than a century before emerging for sale at auction next month.\nMs Kaplan added: 'These two volumes have been in the same family for almost 150 years. 'They constitute one of the most important examples of photographic literature from the 19th century.\n'There are many collectors interested in Victorian era photography, including many in China looking to reclaim their patrimony.\n'We will certainly see Asian collectors, institutional collectors and collectors of the \"photo book\".'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T11:24:49.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
