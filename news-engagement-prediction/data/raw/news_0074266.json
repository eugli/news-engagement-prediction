Ibrahim gave a free makeover to a Pakistani grocery store clerk, who was struggling with low self-esteem for five years. Usman Ahmed, 29, said \"no one wants to marry me because I'm bad-looking\". When Ibrahim heard of Ahmed's story, he wanted to help right away, and Khaleej Times was there to cover Ahmed's transformation at NASA Studio in International City. Ahmed said: \"I'm an average guy. I'm not that good looking, that's why I haven't been married yet. I put on very casual clothes everyday and I go to work. I've been following that pattern for as long as I can remember. But it was starting to feel like that this pattern would continue forever and I'll never get married. \"I know beauty isn't always about what's on the outside, but sometimes it can just get very depressing. I wanted a change.\" Ibrahim said he wanted to \"completely transform\" Ahmed so he could revive his confidence levels. The hairstylist gave Ahmed a new haircut, retouched his beard and did some skin therapy - the results left Ahmed with a massive smile. When Ahmed looked in the mirror after his makeover, he said: \"Is this really me? I look so different. I didn't even know I had this face under all of that hair. Maybe a girl will marry me now.\" Ibrahim said that even though he has cut and styled hair of some of the biggest stars in Hollywood, he wants to help anyone he can by using his skills. He said: \"It feels good to do this. I have worked with celebrities, yes, but, I want to stay humble. I hope this helps him with his confidence and he can start living his life with happiness.\" Ibrahim will be launching his own hair lounge, called SKILLS by Barber MO, in April at Business Bay. He said he expects high-profile clients at his new business, but \"will try to stay humble\" and help those who need it. Meanwhile, Ahmed said he'll be on a lookout for a potential wife while his new look is still in-place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:59:55.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
