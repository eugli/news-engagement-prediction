Article continues below \nThe Leader of the Cenation recently tied Ric Flair’s record of 16-times holding the same belt that The Hitman saw so often those decades ago. \nThe Best There Ever Will Be told Sports Illustrated that if he could go back to WrestleMania and have a match against any superstar, he would want the recently displaced champion in the ring. Article continues below Story of fan who missed out on €34,200 thanks to Leroy Sane has brilliant ending \nHe said: \"It would have been nice to have a great WrestleMania match with The Rock and Edge, but my history would have lined up perfectly with John. \n\"I know I could have a great match with John from the way he wrestles, the way he moves, and his style.\" \n“I’ve seen the thought and concentration he [John Cena] gives into putting together his matches. He’s also very athletic, and we could have put together a great match, and we could put together some incredible storylines.” \nThat statement is huge praise for Cena from a living legend who has participated in some of the biggest matches in WrestleMania history, including an all-timer against Shawn Michaels at the 12th version of the event. \nHart would lose the belt in that match, but it has gone down in wrestling lore as a candidate for the greatest match ever because of the technical perfection on display. \nLuckily fans have access to the WWE’s range of videogames, as they are the only way to settle these hypothetical questions of who would win The Hitman’s dream match at the moment. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
