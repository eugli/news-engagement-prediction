I have a sad story to tell on how my stepfather, a man I loved and respected so much raped me on Valentine's Day when I was 16. As people look forward to the day every year to spend time with their loved ones, I have to battle with the demon that has refused to leave me alone and I make a new resolve to hate men with every bit of me. I have so much hatred for men that if I have my way, I will kill every man I come across because of what one of them did to me. I lost my father when I was 12 and after a few years, my mother decided to get married again so that she would have the security of a man around her. My stepfather did everything to fill the vacuum our late father left and tried all he could to get me and my younger brother to see him as our father. He took a special interest in me and was always buying things for me, taking me out and introduced me to his friends as his daughter. He even went as far as buying my underwears and when I started menstruating, he would buy me sanitary pads. He complimented me so much and at a point, mom was even jealous of our closeness but all that love turned into eternal hatred when I turned 16. It was a day lovers celebrated the now dreaded Valentine's Day and mother had traveled to visit her sick sister and would not come back for some days. She had the belief that we were in the safe hands of her husband, not knowing the devil would get the better of him. That night after dinner, he told me to take some fruit juice to him in the master bedroom. It was not a strange request and that was not the first time he told me to take things to him even when he was alone. Little did I know that my stepfather had something sinister he was planning for me. I wore my night gown that night as I was ready for bed when he sent me on the errand. When I took the juice to him, he said I reminded him of my mother and that I would grow into a beautiful woman. It was also not the first time he was heaping such compliments on me and I just smiled as I made to leave the room but he called me back. When I got back into the room, he told me to close the door as he wanted to tell me something. I closed the door and went to sit beside him on the bed and the first shock came when he started running his hands all over my body. I sprang up from the bed and was about running out of the room when he caught me, threw me to bed and proceeded to tear my night gown. I was screaming and begged him to leave me but he would not listen. My stepfather raped me that night, took my innocence and has turned me into a misandrist all my life. After eh was done, he told me that if I ever tell anyone, he would kill me and the look in his eyes told me he meant what he said. When my mother came back, I could not bring myself to tell her and instead, told her I wanted to go and stay with my father's sister. After some days and seeing that I had made up my mind, she allowed me to go and live with my aunt. I have not told anyone what my stepfather did to me 10 years ago but I have lived with the pain in my heart and I have been planning my revenge all these years and I know that I will have the opportunity of taking my vengeance some day.
