Rebilas, USA TODAY Spor) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nAn attorney for Lance Armstrong has asked a federal judge to give his client another year or so before he goes to trial in the federal government’s $100 million civil fraud case against him. \nThe attorney, John Keker, filed the trial date request with the judge Tuesday, saying he was tied up with a separate criminal mail fraud case this year involving another client, Sushovan Hussain, the former chief financial officer of Autonomy Corp. \nHussain faces charges that he tried to help inflate the price of his company’s failed $11 billion takeover by Hewlett-Packard. Lance Armstrong handed defeat by federal judge \n“Mr. Armstrong respectfully requests that the Court set this case for trial sometime early in 2018, so as not to conflict with the Hussain trial,” Keker wrote. \nKeker’s adversary in both cases is the federal government, which joined the civil case against Armstrong in 2013. It was filed on behalf of the U.S. Postal Service, which paid $32.3 million to sponsor Armstrong’s cycling team from 2000-2004. It accuses Armstrong’s cycling team of violating its sponsorship contract with USPS by taking   blood transfusions to cheat in races – and then concealing that doping to continue payment. \nUnder the False Claims Act, the government could get that money back times three – nearly $100 million – with Armstrong possibly on the hook for all of it. \nKeker’s request comes eight days after Armstrong failed in his bid to have the case thrown out of court. U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper denied his motion for summary judgment, putting the lawsuit on track for trial nearly 12 years since Armstrong last rode for the USPS team. \nThe case originally was filed under seal in 2010 by Floyd Landis, a former teammate of Armstrong’s who also doped and lied about it. If the case succeeds, Landis stands to get a cut of the damages as the whistleblower who brought the case. \nArmstrong has been banned for cycling for life and was stripped of all seven of his Tour de France victories from 1999-2005. After denying doping for more than a decade, he finally confessed to it in January 2013. \nHis attorneys have not disputed his doping in the USPS case but say USPS suffered no damages and instead received far more in value   $32.3 million it paid for it. \nThe government has said the sponsorship is worth zero because the USPS bargained for a clean cycling team but didn’t get one. \nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer on Twitter @Schrotenboer .
