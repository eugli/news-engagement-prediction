John McCain is taking a veiled swipe at President Donald Trump's ongoing attack on the fourth estate, cautioning that \"how dictators get started\" is by shutting down the press.\nGetty Images Sen. John McCain The Republican Arizona senator, in an exclusive interview on Meet the Press airing Sunday, admitted that the relationship between the media and elected officials can sometimes be tense — highlighted by the Trump administration's repeated sparring with reporters and the president calling news organizations \"fake news.\"\nWatch the interview with Sen.

That's how dictators get started.\"\nMcCain clarified that he wasn't referring to the president as a dictator, but that attacks on journalists who are questioning those in power are usually a hallmark of autocratic governments.\n\"When you look at history,\" McCain said, \"the first thing that dictators do is shut down the press.
