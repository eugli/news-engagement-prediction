This received an emotional response from supporters of the protection put into action during Barack Obama's presidency, including Jackie Evancho , who sang at Trump's inauguration last month. \nEvancho's 18-year-old sister, Juliet, is transgender and currently embroiled with their parents in a lawsuit against their local school district in Pennsylvania over her right to use women's bathrooms. Citing her sister, the 16-year-old singer spoke out against the President's decision on Wednesday and civilly asked him for a chance to discuss the issue. \n\"I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide,\" Evancho Tweeted. \nShe followed up hours later then, tweeting to Trump, \"u gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration. Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts.\" \nWhile Trump is known for his tweets, he seldom responds to messages on the social media site. Still, as one of the biggest names to perform at his inauguration, perhaps he'll give Evancho the opportunity to discuss the issue in person. \nSee her tweets here: I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide. #sisterlove — jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 22, 2017 . @realDonaldTrump u gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration.
