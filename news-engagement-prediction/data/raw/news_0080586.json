Abu Sayyaf extremists in the Philippines have released a video of the beheading of Kantner. The brief video circulated Monday, Feb. 27, by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadi websites, is the first sign that the brutal militants proceeded with their threat to kill Kantner in the southern Philippines after a Sunday ransom deadline lapsed. (SITE Intel Group via AP) \nThe Philippine National Police (PNP) appealed to the public on Tuesday to not spread online the video showing Abu Sayyaf bandits beheading German Jurgen Gustav Kantner. \nPNP spokesperson Senior Supt. Dionardo Carlos asked netizens to respect this time of grief of the family of the 71-year-old victim. \n“As we mourn the loss of Mr. Kantner, we earnestly appeal to netizens, internet subscribers and mobile phone users to please refrain from propagating the video clip of Mr. Kantner’s murder,” Carlos said. ADVERTISEMENT \n“He rightfully deserves human dignity even in such gruesome death, while his family and friends deserve respect in this time of grief,” he added. \nREAD: German hostage last words: ‘Now he kill me’ \nThe bandits earlier threatened to behead Kantner on the afternoon of Feb. 26 if they were not paid a P30-million ransom. \nThe bandits kidnapped Kantner in November while his yacht “Rockall” was cruising in waters off Sulu in southern Philippines. The bandits killed his companion, 56-year-old Sabine Merz. \nKantner and Merz were also held captive in Somalia in 2008 for 52 days and were released reportedly after paying a six-figure ransom.
