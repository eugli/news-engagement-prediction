Kim Jong-nam went into hiding in Malaysia after the execution of his uncle Jang Sung-thaek (AFP/Getty) \n“We will get the experts from the atomic energy department to go to the location and sweep it to see if radioactive (material) is still there,” said police chief Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters. \nIt was unclear whether VX contains any radioactive elements. \nMr Kim, the half-brother of dictator Kim Jong-un , had been living in exile since 2003 after falling out of favour with his father, who had been lining up to succeed him as Supreme Leader. \nTwo women - one Vietnamese and the other Indonesian – are in custody along with a North Korean man. \nInvestigators are also seeking seven other North Koreans wanted in connection with the case, including a diplomat pleading immunity at the embassy in Kuala Lumpur . \nInterpol has put an alert out to apprehend four suspects who are believed to have fled Malaysia on the day of the attack and police also hunting two other North Koreans believed to remain in Malaysia, including an employee at the state-owned airline Air Koryo. \nA chemical weapons analysis unit found VX, or S-2 Diisopropylaminoethyl methylphosphonothioate, present on swabs taken from Mr Kim’s eye and face.
