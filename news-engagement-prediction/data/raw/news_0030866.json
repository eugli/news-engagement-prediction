CHAOTIC START \nOn the flip side, he’s being blamed for the knee injury Rollins sustained, and since then, some fans are criticising him for being a stiff and careless worker.

Article continues below Video: Lee Dixon accused of racism whilst commentating on Liverpool vs Spurs \nOn this week’s Wrestling Observer Live, Bryan Alvarez noted that Reigns was a little banged up from his match with Joe earlier this week on Monday Night Raw. \nRingSideNews are claiming that it was one particular powerslam during the match which caused Reigns some physical discomfort. REIGNS 'BANGED UP' \nHowever, the good news is that he’s not expected to miss any in-ring action because of it, not on the live shows anyway. \nWhile rumours indicated that there was no initial heat on Joe for his part in Rollins’ injury, it’s clear that the former NXT Champion is still adjusting to life on the main roster, as this is the second opponent in as many weeks that he’s hurt, albeit unintentionally. \nNot only that, but he’s often criticised for ending Tyson Kidd’s wrestling career, although WWE might be combating that now with speculation that his Muscle Buster has been banned, as he didn’t use it earlier this week. \nPerhaps Reigns not being seriously injured is a lucky escape for Joe, as potentially injuring a second top superstar could have taken its toll on future booking. \nHere’s hoping week three brings Joe some better luck. \nWhat do you make of Samoa Joe hurting Roman Reigns in their match?
