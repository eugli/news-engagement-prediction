It all started with Zoya Akhtar's ensemble film, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011). But, her last out-and-out commercial release was in 2014 — Happy Ending — in which she starred alongside Saif Ali Khan.\nWhile the actress says there's no dearth of work, Bollywood has remained elusive lately. Speaking to us at the trailer launch of her upcoming film, Mantra, she says, \"There\nare never enough scripts and stories for any actor. In my case, not enough scripts come to me. It's not like 20,000 stories are offered and I am being snooty, trying to reject things because it doesn't suit me.\nI complain less because once in a while I am offered a mainstream Bollywood film, and it's the right one. There's a perception about me being choosy, but I actually say yes to most scripts that come my way.\"\nHowever, she refuses to be pigeonholed. \"I want to do a commercial role, but no one's offering me another Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani. Films are business-oriented and casting matters. Who brings more money to the pocket is what matters. My audience is more urban; the youth and the Internet watch me more. But when we look at the masses, I am not really known in smaller towns.\"\nIt's unfortunate, feels the fiery actress, who is hailed for her strong opinions, memorable roles and solid acting chops,that she has to put a word out there. Quelling all perception about being an indie star or wanting to play only leading parts, she clarifies, \"I have never been insecure and would play any role that interests me. I have never thrown a tantrum to be a leading lady or turned down directors for offering me a small part. I should have a fleshy role and that's all. I don't have any specifications.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:56:47.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
