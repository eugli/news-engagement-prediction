For the unpractice rest of us, a playful pout can turn into a duck-face disaster in the blink of an eye. For tips, we turned to the good folks at NSFW, a social club and creative agency dedicated to legal adventures in sex, drugs and licentiousness. As it happens, NSFW’s Chief Conspirator teaches a class in sexy selfies called “Swipe Right.” We tapped the anonymous instructor for his best tips.\n1. Give good face \nIt's important to get to know your face. The best way to do this is to practice poses in a mirror and to grab some pics to see the results. Discover your best side and the angles which capture you best. Consider your hair and how to use it to accent the features you want to highlight. Also try going lighter on the make-up for a more natural look and grab some shots with your lips slightly parted, a strong flirty signal for both men and women.\n2. Strike a pose \nAre you getting enough sex? Find out here! \nKim Kardashian celebrated having 27 million Instagram followers with a sexy selfie. (kimkardashian/via Intsagram) You'll want to begin practicing with your phone's auto-timer and purchase a tripod. Promark makes one with adjustable legs which is great for positioning. Shoot in a space with enough room and skip shooting in tiny bathrooms. When you're ready to grab the perfect shot place a mirror behind your camera so that you can adjust your pose. Shooting in a bedroom is an obvious choice to remind your lover where the magic happens, but consider other spaces in your home to add a little context to your shots. Be ready to take a few dozen shots to find the perfect one.\n3. Play dress up (or undress altogether) \nYou don't have to go nude to capture your sexiest self but if you choose to, hide your face unless you're cool with your parents or kids seeing the pics someday. Our hook-up society is rife with horror stories of revenge porn and private images going public so protect your privacy to prevent any future misfortunes. Find the items in your closet that make you feel sexiest. If that means a tee with cotton knickers, go that route. If it's lacy lingerie or leather, bring it. The sexier you feel in what you're wearing, the more likely you'll express that feeling into your photos.\nBella Hadid posted this boomerang video on Instagram, Jan. 2017. (Bella Hadid via Instagram) 4. Find the right light \nNetflix and chill with Michael Bolton on Valentine’s \nNatural light is always best so consider your windows and the time of day you're capturing your naughty shots. Try to dim lights or switch to red light bulbs to add some sensual lighting to your photos. Test photos with and without your camera’s flash to see which works best. Also, be mindful of overhead lights, which add shadows to your face and body.\n5. Filters and apps are your friend \n31 photos view gallery 2017 Valentine's Day Gift Guide Test out a few different filters and apps to see which best captures you. Soften and blur photos for a more romantic effect and test out black and white photo filters.
