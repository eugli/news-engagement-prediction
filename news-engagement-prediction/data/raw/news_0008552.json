(Source: twitter) \nTaking a dig at Samajwadi Party, Congress and Bahujan Samajwadi Party together, Prime Minister Narendra Modi used another acronym, this time for ‘SCAM’. He said that S stands for Samajwadi, C for Congress, A for Akhilesh and M for Mayawati, drawing huge response from the crowd. \nIncidentally, many scams broke out during the Congress government, most notably the Coal and 2G Spectrum scam. In the 2G Spectrum Scam, former Telecom minister A. Raja was accused for the fraud of Rs. 1.76 lakh crore and CAG said that he evaded norms at entry level and carried out the 2G license awards in 2008, pegged at 2001 prices. \nDuring the Coal Scam , a fraud of Rs. 1,86,000 crore was reported in the allocation of nation’s coal deposit to PSU’s and private companies. Both these incidents took place when Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister of the country. \nOn the other hand, Akhilesh Yadav and Samajwadi Party has been on Narendra Modi’s target for not being able to maintain law and order in the state.
