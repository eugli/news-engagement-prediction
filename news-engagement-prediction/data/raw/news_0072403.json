The former has been priced at Rs 59,990 while the latter will set you back Rs 39,990. \nThe HTC U Play comes with a 5.2 inch fullHD display, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage which can be expanded via a microSD card, a 2,500mAh battery and is powered by the octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor. \nOn the imaging front, the device comes with a 16MP rear camera with optical image stabilisation, phase detection autofocus, a dual-tone flash and an aperture of f/2.0 along with a 16MP front-facing camera. \nThe dual-sim smartphone runs on HTC's own Sense UI running atop Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Massively overpriced \nThe MediaTek Helio P10 processor has no place in a smartphone that costs almost 40,000 rupees. The OnePlus 3T, which is 10,000 rupees cheaper, comes with the much more powerful Snapdragon 821 coupled with an inane 6GB of RAM. \nTo put things into perspective, the Xperia XA, priced at just 15,999 rupees comes with the same processor as the U Play which is almost three times as expensive. \nThe U Play is a mid-range device that has been priced at near flagship levels. Smartphones like the Huawei Honor 8, Lenovo Z2 Plus and LeEco LeMax 2 come with much better hardware at a fraction of the cost. The U Play's price clearly reflects how behind the times HTC is when it comes to understanding the market \nWhat damns the smartphone even further is the fact that flagships like the Xperia XZ, Samsung Galaxy S7 and HTC's own HTC 10 cost just a little more than the U Play. HTC India needs a reality check \nThe U Play's price clearly reflects how behind the times HTC is when it comes to understanding the market. The mobile landscape in India has undergone a drastic shift thanks to companies like OnePlus and Xiaomi. Also Read: HTC U Ultra vs Google Pixel: Is HTC finally back in the game? \nHTC needs to realize the fact that its brand value has taken a severe dip in the past few years and it cannot keep charging a premium for their smartphones. Forget pricing their smartphones below products from competition with superior brand value, HTC needs to atleast price their devices realistically with market realities in mind. \nThe HTC U Play does come with a few novel features such as: U-Sonic: Sonar based audio system The U Play comes with a sonar-based audio system called U-Sonic that claims to deliver true crystal clear sound that is capable of adapting to the user. The U Play comes without a regular 3.5mm audio jack and has a single USB Type-C out for charging, data syncing and high-res audio. Biometric voice unlock The HTC U Play also comes with a one-of-its-kind biometric voice unlock and control mechanism which allows users to securely unlock their phone without even interacting with it. Sense Companion \nThe U Play comes with HTC's own version of an AI based assistant dubbed 'Sense Companion' which the company claims \"isn't only about machine learning, but also an an extension of you, the user,\" \nSense Companion \"can suggest that you dress warmer and leave a little earlier for work if snow is forecast; remind you to take a power bank on longer trips; and even recommend a restaurant when you're away for the weekend and then book seats for you2. Best of all, it's made to evolve and get to know you better over time,\" HTC adds. Also Read: U Ultra, U Play quick review: HTC's new phones are a whole new level of shiny \nSense Companion will not come pre-installed in the U Play and will be made available sometime in early 2017 via a software update. \nAll these features are unique and look extremely promising but are not worth the 10,000 premium the U Play commands over the segment benchmark, the OnePlus 3T, which on paper at least is superior in almost every way. \nWith a realistic price of around 25,000 rupees, the Play could have become an unique alternative to the likes of the Xiaomi Mi 5, Xperia X and the OnePlus 3T but at the current rate, it is dead on arrival.
