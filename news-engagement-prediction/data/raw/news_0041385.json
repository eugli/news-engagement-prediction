Courtesy ABC News 24, 2SM. \nAnalysts are carefully watching - perhaps hoping - for signs the US is reverting to a more conventional foreign policy after the early volley of presidential firecrackers. \nAustralia has won a new notoriety in US politics over recent weeks, shared between popular late-night talk shows as well as foreign policy boffins, as a harbinger for how Mr Trump has performed.
