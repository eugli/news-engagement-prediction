Kennedy Airport in New York is getting a brand-new terminal for animals. \nThe ARK at JFK is going to be a beautiful facility for animals of all kinds — from baby pups to big horses. \nIt’s going to be 178,000 square feet on 14.4 acres. The facility will be open 24 hours a day, seven days a week to care for your pets at all times — before and after flights. The ARK \nIt’s going to have a bunch of crates and living spaces for these animals to hang out in, as well as ample room for larger animals. \nHorses will have a space for quarantine after international travel, and they’re helpful for understanding travel laws with animals. \nIt will also have a crazy spa space where animals can chill. The spa will have things like grooming, massage therapy and bone-shaped pools. Animal pals can get “pawdicures with colored nail pawlish.” The Ark \nThere’s a “top dog suite” where dogs can sleep in big beds, watch TV and talk to their owners via webcams. \nAnd don’t worry: They’ll have framed photos of their owners so they never forget who locked them into this facility away from home overnight. \nThe ARK at JFK is a $65 million project that is supposed to be finished later this year. ARK \nIt all sounds great except for, uh… hold up one second: The dog gets a human-sized bed and I’m just supposed to curl up on a pleather chair and stick it out? \nI mean, OK, if you’ve ever flown through John F. Kennedy airport — and you’ve also been to any other airport — you know it sucks. \nNew York airports are notoriously terrible. It’s one thing Trump and me actually agreed on . \nThe ARK is a private project, so I can’t be that mad, but honestly? What the heck? \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
