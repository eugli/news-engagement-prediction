They are scheduled to play Zimbabwe on February 13.\n\"Getting a hundred for India is always special. It was really satisfying to get runs today when the team required a good opening partnership. The ball was not coming on to the bat later in the innings, so getting runs was not easy. I'd gone into the match aiming to get runs at a fair pace and succeeded in that,\" Kamini said.\nIn another Group A match, Zimbabwe registered their first win, beating Thailand by 36 runs.\nMeanwhile, Pakistan scored a huge 236-run win over Papua New Guinea, while Bangladesh defeated Scotland by seven wickets.\nSouth Africa, which did not have a match today, have also won two games from a match less and are the favourites from Group B.\nBrief Scores:\nIndia: 250 for 2 in 50 overs (Thirush Kamini 113 not out, Deepti Sharma 89).\nIreland: 125 all out in 49.1 overs (Gaby Lewis 33, Isobel Joyce 31; Poonam Yadav 3/30, Shikha Pandey 2/11, Devika Vaidya 2/11).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:42:48.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
