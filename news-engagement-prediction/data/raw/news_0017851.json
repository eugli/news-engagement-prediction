A five-minute stop-motion adaptation of Tove Jansson’s Moomintroll books , The Moomins would gently warp the nation’s youth’s impressionable brains over the next three years. For this wasn’t the papercraft wistfulness of Ivor The Engine, or Morph’s Plasticine surrealism, but a troubling 1977 Polish adaptation of Jannson’s deep-thought hippo-sprite monographs, crunched into mini-reveries of Fuzzy-Felt melancholia by future Pob and Tellytubbies creator Anne Wood. \nCentral to its strange pull, however, was the mesmerising music illuminating the adventures of Moomintroll and gang, a tottering agglomeration of flutey homespun folk, grunting monster choirs, warped Satie piano and hissy proto-techno, orchestrated by two Leeds-based post-punkers, Steve Shill and Graeme Miller. Moomins to be remade by producers of The Bridge Read more \n“We were taking magic mushrooms and writing ambient psychedelia for the Impact Theatre Co-Operative,” remembers Miller. “Anne maybe saw one show [of ours] called The Undersea World Of Eric Satie, where Steve played a French waiter slowly drowning in a glass tank. We never asked: ‘Why us?’ You just accepted it.” \nPresented with a brief to write 30 minutes of music, including “a theme tune, a sad theme, and a travelling theme”, Shill and Miller transported their malfunctioning DIY kit to London and set out to make everything sound “deliberately antique, like something’s already passed: pan pipes and ocarinas with wobbly synths, this wonky montage of northern melancholy”. Keep on Moomin: Steve Shill and Graeme Miller. Photograph: Tyrone Huggins/PR \nThe duo never received further soundtrack commissions: Miller went into acting, Shill into film-making. But their one and only effort is finally being released. Sourced from a tape Miller found on his bookshelf, these ghostly transmissions from Moominvalley now sound oddly revolutionary – ethereal blueprints for Boards Of Canada and Aphex Twin ’s own downtempo electronic evocations of vanished childhood, perhaps. \nNow an LA-based director, who’s helmed episodes of The Sopranos, Deadwood and The Wire , Shill holds The Moomins to be “as valuable as anything in my career”. Miller, currently an installation artist and composer, agrees: “At the time, I’d prowl the streets at 4.15 of an afternoon, listening to the theme tune come out of people’s windows. A children’s TV tune is a gateway into a lost world. It’s great to be able to bring it back.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T15:54:25.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
