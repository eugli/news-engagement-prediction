Salisbury/McClatchy Company and Tribune Company, via Getty Images The Portuguese authorities have detained a former undercover C.I.A. officer whose extradition has been sought by Italy , where she faces a prison sentence over her role in the 2003 kidnapping of an Egyptian cleric as part of a secret United States rendition program. The former officer, Sabrina De Sousa, 60, was detained Monday evening and is awaiting imminent extradition to Italy, according to one of her lawyers, Dario Bolognesi. Ms. De Sousa was among 26 Americans convicted of grabbing the cleric , Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, in Milan in February 2003. The operation was one of the so-called renditions ordered by President George W. Bush’s administration after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Suspects were captured and transferred to other countries for interrogation. The program were ended by the administration of President Barack Obama. Mr. Nasr was taken to a military base before being moved to Egypt, where he claimed he was tortured. In 2013, an Italian court sentenced him in absentia to six years in prison for terrorism-related activities. At the time he was plucked off the streets, Ms. De Sousa, a native of India and a dual citizen of the United States and Portugal , was undercover in Milan, posing as a diplomat.

That October, she was briefly detained under a European arrest warrant and had her passports confiscated. She was arrested on Monday as she was on her way to visit relatives in India, according to news accounts that cited her lawyer in Portugal. Mr. Bolognesi, her lawyer in Milan, said on Tuesday that she emailed him Monday evening to tell him that she had been arrested in Lisbon and was awaiting transfer to Italy. He said he had not heard from her since. \nAdvertisement Mr. Bolognesi met with Italian Justice Ministry officials in Rome on Tuesday, but he said that the officials told him they “had not received any official communication” from Portuguese authorities.
