Check it out in the player below! \nJohnny Depp returns to the big screen as the iconic, swashbuckling anti-hero Jack Sparrow in the all-new Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales . The rip-roaring adventure finds down-on-his-luck Captain Jack feeling the winds of ill-fortune blowing strongly his way when deadly ghost sailors, led by the terrifying Captain Salazer (Javier Bardem), escape from the Devil’s Triangle bent on killing every pirate at sea – notably Jack. Jack’s only hope of survival lies in the legendary Trident of Poseidon, but to find it he must forge an uneasy alliance with Carina Smyth (Kaya Scodelario), a brilliant and beautiful astronomer, and Henry (Benton Thwaites), a headstrong young sailor in the Royal Navy. At the helm of the Dying Gull, his pitifull small and shabby ship, Captain Jack seeks not only to reverse his recent spate of ill fortune, but to save his very life from the most formidable and malicious foe he has never faced. \nPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales also stars Kevin R. McNally as Joshamee Gibbs, Golshifteh Farahani as the sea-witch Shansa, David Wenham as Scarfield, Stephen Graham as Scrum, and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa. \nDirected by Norwegian filmmakers Espen Sandberg and Joachim Rønning ( Kon-Tiki ), Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales will debut in theaters on May 26, 2017. \nShare your thoughts on this new Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales Super Bowl spot in the comments below!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:42:50.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
