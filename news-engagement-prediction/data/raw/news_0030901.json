During the marathon, we communicated one message, Run diff and that motivated thousands of Lagosians”. \nOne participant gladly spoke about his experience during the marathon commending 7up’s association saying “this year was truly diff as 7up switched it big time. I ran last year but this year brought a different feeling. Even though I didn’t finish the race, I’m excited and already looking forward to next year where I’ll finish what I started.” \nSee photos from the Marathon here. \nFollow 7up_Nigeria on Facebook, twitter and instagram to share your experience and view more exciting moments from the marathon. \n7up….
