Essentially, they want to give the refugees a right to vote . They need not be an EU citizen nor do they need to pay taxes. The mere right to vote is you happen to be there at the time. Meanwhile, the SPD has now taken the lead in polls from Merkel. Martin Schulz, the German Social Democrats’ candidate for federal elections in September, is the very person who in the EU wants to federalize Europe and this scheme is intended to use anyone other than Germans to win the election. \nThe Social Democrats are 63.7% in favor of letting the refugees vote. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) poll shows 96.9% against Schulz’s idea. Can you imagine letting everyone from Mexico come into the USA and then vote if the United States should petition Mexico to join them? It seems the left is just totally insane. They will do absolutely anything to win and that means they will allow all of the Middle East to enter Germany and then outnumber the Germans in their own election?! Where is the logic here? \nSpiegel , the German magazine reported: \n“ In 1990, all of Germany celebrated the reunification of a country divided since World War II. But the optimism was naively misplaced. The real German division sees the North pitted against the South.” \nAs Spiegel went on: \n“What happens when a blonde moves from Berlin to Bavaria? The collective IQs of both places go up — at least according to a favorite joke told in the German capital. And the Bavarians? They just call everybody not from their easy-going part of Germany Sau Preussen, or “pig Prussians.” In other words, not a lot of love is lost between the North and the South in Germany.” \nSeven Weeks’ War, also called Austro- Prussian War , (1866), war between Prussia on the one side and Austria, Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover, and certain minor German states on the other. It ended in a Prussian victory, which meant the exclusion of Austria from Germany. This was the unification of Germany. Bismarck had maintained that he orchestrated the conflict in order to bring about the North German Confederation, the Franco-Prussian War and the ultimate unification of Germany. \nOf course, the concept of Germany as a nation or distinct region within central Europe can be traced to Julius Caesar. It was Caesar who referred to the unconquered area east of the Rhine as Germania. Indeed, Germanicus was the name given to the great-nephew of Augustus, Caesar’s heir. \nIt was in 962 AD, when Otto I became the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, thereby establishing the medieval German state. Interestingly enough, if we square 31.4 we arrive at 985.96 years. Add that to 962 we come to 1947. Just on 51.6 year wave of the ECM thereafter brings us to the start of the Euro in 1999. \nThe likelihood of Germany dividing North v South is extremely high. This entire refugee issue was bad enough. For the SPD to try to give them votes to take control will set off an internal German civil war.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:39:46.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
