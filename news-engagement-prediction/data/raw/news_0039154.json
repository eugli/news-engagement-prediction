By a party line vote, they've authorized the state's (Democratic) attorney general to sue the federal government over immigration or other policies—whether (Republican) Gov. Larry Hogan wants him to or not . Until Wednesday, Maryland reserved the power to sue the federal government to the governor and the General Assembly — one of only eight states that do not grants that autonomy to attorney generals. \nThe joint resolution allows [Attorney General] Frosh to initiate a lawsuit against the government for a long list of action or inaction that the attorney general judges an infringement of Marylanders' rights. \nRepublicans are, of course, nonplussed by this, with Republican Del. Pat McDonough expressing worry that the move will result in retaliation by Trump: \"if you keep poking him in the eye ... are [we] going to get anything?\" \nThe resistance keeps resisting. America isn't going to devolve into Trump's preferred brand of nationalism and stupidity without a fight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:28:12.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
