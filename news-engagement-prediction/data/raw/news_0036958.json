Two stylish men-on-the-make nailed one of each yesterday—24-year-old Nick Jonas in the slick nighttime look, and expectant father Steven Yeun in the errand-running daytime look. Both stylish guys got their respective rigs right by sticking to menswear's favorite neutral hues, nailing the fit, and picking pieces that looked polished, but hardly fussy. Here’s what you can learn from their excellent taste: Friday Night: A bomber jacket and your favorite black T-shirt. \nNick Jonas understands the importance of outerwear. In fact, his style is built around it . When you have a nice-looking jacket—a leather bomber is always a good choice—you can wear jeans and a black T-shirt out at night and still look like you tried. Throw on some spare leather sneakers (the dressy kind) or Chelsea boots and you’re ready for any movie, dinner, or bar adventure the evening holds. Saturday Afternoon: Something broken-in and baggy with boss sunglasses. \nTailored sweatpants might be the modern guy’s hangover uniform but broken-in, baggy jeans are a good option too. They won’t give you away quite as quickly and they’re just as comfortable. Make like Steven Yeun, a style minimalist , and pair them with a blue or gray sweatshirt, beat-up boots, and your favorite thick-frame sunglasses. The sunglasses are crucial whether you’re hungover or not; running errands with efficiency on the weekend is all about avoiding eye contact.
