(Photo: Courtesy WNYC) \nLooking for something new to listen to while you drive to work/go for a walk/wash the dishes? We're here for you. In a weekly series, we're highlighting a podcast, audio personality or specific story worth hearing. This week's pick: Radiolab presents More Perfect \nLast June, the producers of popular Radiolab debuted their first spin-off: a show about the Supreme Court. The six episodes from Season 1 are available now, and Season 2 is coming later this year. To that, we say, \"Oyez!\" Why it's ripe for listening Object Anyway \nAs the Trump administration prepares to confirm a new Supreme Court justice, you might be wondering, 'What have the Supremes been up to all of this time?' Well, More Perfect has some profound and fascinating answers. \nEven if you've never taken a law class or read a court case, listening to the WNYC mini-series feels like drawing a warm bath of knowledge for your brain. From stories about how a ruling meant to eliminate race-based jury selection made the problem worse (\" Object Anyway \"), to a case that gave one justice a nervous breakdown (\" Political Thicket \"), the stories about nine people in robes are stimulating, eye-opening and worth sharing. Memorable line \nIn a montage of audio, people describe on Supreme Court justice in \"Political Thicket:\" \n\"Justice Frankfurter was one of the most influential justices of all time ... as a person, Justice Frankfurter wasn't necessarily the nicest person ... I always call him a 'bantam rooster' ... he was a difficult, crusty figure ... he was short, and he had a little bit of a pouch on him ... he was one of the most ... condescending ... egotistical of justices.\" \nTo se last week's podcast pick, go here .
