Anita Chabria achabria@sacbee.com i \nBy Anita Chabria \nMore than 100 demonstrators have shut down the Interstate 5 freeway on-ramp from I Street in Sacramento at the peak of the afternoon commute, protesting the Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office decision to clear police officers in the fatal shooting of Joseph Mann. \nLast Friday, The Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office cleared the two officers, John Tennis and Randy Lozoya, of any legal wrongdoing in the July 11 shooting of Mann. The 50-year-old black man was shot and killed by Tennis and Lozoya after 911 callers reported a man acting erratically and armed with a knife and gun. Mann was later found to have a knife with a 3.5-inch blade, but no gun was found. \nThe local chapter of Black Lives Matter organized a protest Wednesday afternoon that began at City Hall and then ventured down I Street, shutting down the major artery used by downtown commuters to leave Sacramento via Interstate 5. \nPolice officers have blocked the on-ramps to prevent protesters from walking onto the freeway. \nProtesters have chanted, “No Sac PD!” and “DA Schubert, we don’t want you!” \nAs of 5:10 p.m., the onramp remains closed. \nThis is a breaking news story.
