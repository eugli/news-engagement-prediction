The Patriots have just run out onto the field for warm-ups to huge cheers and a smattering of boos. On the way here, I was struck just how grey Houston is, until I stepped off the coach into sunshine and realised the media coach had tinted windows. The sky has since clouded over a little but it’s a warm, Texas winter’s day - a little muggy. Then again, we’re in a roofed stadium with aircon. \nFacebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.13pm GMT 15:13 \nHunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here’s Paolo Bandini’s game prediction:\n\nAtlanta led the NFL in scoring during the regular season, with Ryan averaging a ridiculous 9.3 yards per passing attempt and generally performing at a level above anything he had produced in his (already solid) career. Meanwhile, no team gave up fewer points than the Patriots.\nIt’s worth noting that the Falcons have not just been running up the scores against bad teams. According to Football Outsiders’s advanced DVOA metrics, they faced the second-most efficient group of defenses of any team in the NFL this season. Atlanta put 38 points on Arizona, 29 on Kansas City, 23 on Denver and then 36 on Seattle last month in the playoffs.\nThe Patriots have barely faced a team all season with anything close to this offensive potential. They did restrict the Steelers to a combined 33 points in two meetings, but Pittsburgh were missing Ben Roethlisberger in week seven, and lost Le’Veon Bell early in the AFC championship game.\nFor the full game report:\nSuper Bowl LI prediction: Patriots' stout defense to tip scales against Falcons Read more Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:38:28.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
