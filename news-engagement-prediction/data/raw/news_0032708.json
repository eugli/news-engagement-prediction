Article continues below \nThe 43-year-old is also the fifth highest goalscorer in the Italian league with 313 goals and also boasts the record for the most hat-tricks (10). \nIn European competitions, Inzaghi is only behind the likes of Raul, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in terms of most goals scored with a staggering 70 to his name.

Crooks compares Gabbiadini to Inzaghi \nCrooks described Gabbiadini's goals against the Black Cats as \"moments of predatory genius\" before going on to making comparisons to the Milan legend. \n\"His second goal was sensational and reminiscent of his Italian countryman Filippo Inzaghi at his best,\" Crooks said . \"There is so much about Gabbiadini's game that reminds me of Inzaghi - not least his finishing.\" \nGabbiani came into the fold for previous club Napoli following the departure of Gonzalo Higuain to Juventus and an injury to main striker Arkadiusz Milik. \nDespite a decent spell in Naples and a great start to life in the Premier League, comparisons with the great Inzaghi might be unfair at this point. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
