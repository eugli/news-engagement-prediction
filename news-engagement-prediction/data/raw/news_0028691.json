What is a state visit? \nThe government responds to all petitions on its website if they are signed by more than 10,000 people, and a similar response has been issued in support of the one calling for the state visit to go ahead. \nPublished on the petitions website, they say the government believes Mr Trump \"should be extended the full courtesy of a state visit\", adding: \"This invitation reflects the importance of the relationship between the United States of America and the United Kingdom. \n\"At this stage, final dates have not yet been agreed for the state visit.\" \nThe invitation was issued during Prime Minister Theresa May's talks in Washington with the US president last month. \nThe petition, which said Mr Trump should be allowed into the UK but not to make a state visit, came amid protests at his executive order preventing people from seven mainly-Muslim countries from entering the US. \nMrs May, who criticised the immigration crackdown, had already rejected calls for the state visit to be cancelled.
