the mainland has washed ashore in the Aloha State. Post to Facebook An island-hopping Hawaiian brewery trail The craft beer movement submerging the mainland has washed ashore in the Aloha State.  //usat.ly/2jPAQ8l   Join the Nation's Conversation To   An island-hopping Hawaiian brewery trail Brad Japhe, Special for USA TODAY 7:04 a.m. ET Jan. 31, 2017 Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Kona Brewing Company launched the Hawaiian craft beer movement in 1994, when its brewery opened on the Big Island followed by an adjacent brewpub. Kona Brewing Company Today, the flagship Longboard Island Lager is a fixture at bars across the lower 48, alongside Fire Rock, a hop-forward pale ale, and Wailua Wheat, brewed with tropical passionfruit. Kona Brewing Company Fullscreen Head to the source in the town that lends them their name for a wide range of specialty brews that don’t make it to the mainland. Here you’ll get a sense of brewmaster Ryan McVeigh’s inventive approach to beer making. Kona Brewing Company Enjoy one-offs brewed with lychee, wheatgrass or even jabuticaba (a tropical, grape-like berry) to pair with classic pupu (appetizers) such as Ahi poke or nachos covered in Kalua pork. Kona Brewing Company Expansion looms, with a new IPA available in the States this year (Hanalei, a session beer brewed with guava, orange and passionfruit juices). Kona Brewing Company The brewery operates a secondary pub outside of Honolulu with a similar menu, although no beer is made there. Kona Brewing Company Fullscreen Down the street from the original brewpub, construction has started on a larger facility slated to open by 2018. Satisfying the company’s dedication to sustainability, the new operation incorporates advanced water conservation in addition to solar and biogas energy to help supplement resource needs. Kona Brewing Company Fullscreen Although it’s now common practice in the industry, Maui Brewing Company was among the first craft breweries to embrace canning, just more than a decade ago. This allowed owner Garrett Marrero to avoid the steep tariff imposed upon empty bottles shipped into the state. The durable packaging also helped protect his core line of products on the long journey across the ocean, allowing them to eventually reach a global audience. Maui Brewing Company Fullscreen Now fans return the favor, flocking thousands of miles to see where one of their favorite beers was birthed. And it’s quite a sight, indeed. Maui Brewing’s new 42,000-square-foot facility on the island’s leeward shore is less than a mile removed from the turquoise surf of Maalaea Bay. Maui Brewing Company Forty five-minute tours are offered daily for $15, which earns you a souvenir glass and a tasting of the flagships, including Pineapple Mana Wheat, Big Swell IPA and Iwa Porter — brewed with real coconut. Maui Brewing Company For a wider range of offerings head up the road to visit the brewpub in Lahaina. Visitors to Oahu can now quench their thirst at a satellite outpost in Waikiki, and by 2018, at a third location planned for Kailua. Maui Brewing Company Fullscreen Kohola Brewery might be the new kid on the block, but this one-year-old startup named after the Hawaiian word for whale, is already making a big splash. The Lokahi Pilsner took home a medal at last year’s Great American Beer Festival in Denver, beating out big name breweries in a fiercely competitive category. Sample that as well as nine more selections at the brewery and tasting room in Lahaina — the former space of Maui Brewing. Kohola Brewery Standouts range from a lighter saison, infused with island-grown lemons, to Mean Bean, a full-bodied stout brewed with Maui’s own Red Catuai coffee beans. Scott Hareland Happy Hour beer specials run daily from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. Kohola Brewery Fullscreen When Kauai Beer Company opened its doors in Lihue, it was more than just a boon to Kauai’s fledgling craft beer scene, it helped revitalize an entire downtown. With the decline of the sugarcane industry at the end of the ‘90s, shops had shuttered and tourists largely avoided the area. Jim Guerber and his son Justin gave travelers two great reasons to visit: great beer and tasty grub. Kauai Beer Company Fullscreen That was in 2013. Today the brewpub is as much a local fixture as it is a tourist attraction, offering an island take on classic German styles such as Black Limousine, a Bavarian schwarzbier with a dark color and lighter body, and Honey Lager, crafted with flaked corn and local honey. Kauai Beer Company The food runs the gamut from the traditional (Bavarian pretzels, mac ‘n’ cheese) to absolute Aloha (Ginger Taro Cakes, pictured, and Kiawe Crusted Coconut Sweet Potato Raviolis). Kauai Beer Company Take a growler to-go before hitting up the many breathtaking trails that make the Garden Isle an incomparable scenic destination. Kauai Beer Company Craft beer goes high-brow at The Ritz-Carlton Kapalua, a luxe resort situated on 22,000 acres of oceanfront property. Don Riddle Fullscreen You might expect local brews to populate the menu at more casual settings such as the poolside bar or the Burger Shack, set directly on the beach. But even the most elegant food and beverage areas here pour custom beer, brewed specifically for the hotel. Don Riddle The Ritz-Carlton collaborated with nearby Kohona Brewery to create Shorebreak Session Ale. The Ritz-Carlton Kapalua It’s a vibrant offering balancing the flavors of bitter hops and Calamansi peel, with fresh pineapple, guava and ruby red grapefruit. In the land of parasol-garnished tropical cocktails, it’s well on its way to becoming a staple beverage. The Ritz-Carlton Kapalua Room service will gladly deliver frosty pints to your ocean view suite, but even day trippers are welcome to the many sights and suds the property has to offer. Don Riddle Fullscreen With 37 selections on tap and more than 250 bottles, “REAL a gastropub” easily distinguishes itself as one of the biggest craft beer bars in all of Hawaii. But quantity isn’t the whole story. It’s what they serve, the fine fare its paired with, and the knowledgeable staff serving it all that crowns this Honolulu hot spot as king of the gastropub. REAL a gastropub Many of the beers on draft here are either made exclusively for this location, or are simply unavailable elsewhere in the state. REAL a gastropub Sifting through the lengthy list to arrive at the perfect pint can be a daunting task, which is why the bar employs certified cicerones (sommeliers of beer) to provide guidance. REAL a gastropub One thing you won’t need help with is devouring their legendary duck confit corn dogs; just the right amount of crisped cornmeal coating enveloping juicy poultry, dipped together into a house-made Guinness mustard. REAL a gastropub Honolulu Beerworks is a true microbrewery. Honolulu Beerworks The three-year-old brewpub just south of downtown ferments on a seven-barrel system. Compare that to Maui Brewing’s 75 barrels and you’ll have an idea of what they’re working with. Honolulu Beerworks The husband-and-wife-run operation is highlighted by barrel-aged beers and an inviting taproom, weaving repurposed barnyard charm into the industrial trappings of a functional brewhouse. They excel at esoteric styles heretofore underserved by the local scene. Honolulu Beerworks The farmhouse ale, bursting with cloves and peppercorn, is crisp and refreshing, as is the Cocoweizen — an unfiltered wheat beer featuring coconut. Honolulu Beerworks . The food, greener and less greasy than standard pub fare, is enhanced al fresco amidst the urban zen of an alleyway beer garden. Honolulu Beerworks A modernized take on the gastropub, Monkeypod Kitchen isn’t just celebrated for what is served, so much as how it’s served. Monkeypod Kitchen Thirty-six craft lines are piped through a state-of-the-art ‘Blizzard’ system, ensuring that the beer maintains a steadfast temperature of 29 degrees from keg to glass. Don Bloom, Tropical Light Fullscreen In the Monkeypod kitchen, chef Peter Merriman keeps the menu fresh, with seasonally inspired fare -- pub grub elevated to lofty heights. Ginger crusted Kona Kampachi has wheat beer written all over it, while the coconut milk corn chowder is an IPA’s best friend. Monkeypod Kitchen Come chill during happy hour to enjoy the lookout over Ka’ula Bay, or arrive at sunset for live acoustic entertainment. Either way, a temperature-controlled craft beer awaits. Ryan Siphers Largely overshadowed by Kona, Mehana Brewing Company -- the Big Island’s other craft brewery -- is making its own waves, with a handful of beers worth seeking out. Mehana Brewing Company At Mehana’s Hilo-based headquarters, you can sample them all for free. Mehana Brewing Company While tours aren’t currently available, the tasting room is open six days a week (excluding Sundays) from noon until 5 p.m. Mehana Brewing Company Fullscreen Here you can swig on Southern Cross, a unique double red ale with notes of toffee and citrus, or the crushable kolsch — a dependable warm-weather refresher. There’s nothing flashy about the space, it’s an unapologetically frill-free waystation for growler fills and six packs on your way to world-class beaches just up the road. Mehana Brewing Company Fullscreen While they don’t technically make beer at all, Nani Moon’s status as the first mead maker in Hawaii is enough to attract craft enthusiasts. It also helps that what they’re crafting is delicious, and overflowing in indigenous flavor. Nani Moon Meadery Fullscreen Mead is the oldest fermented beverage in recorded history, typically made from honey, with an alcohol content punched up closer to wine than beer. Stephanie Krieger began fermenting the beverage out of her Kauai garage in 2000. It took some 10 years for the hobby to blossom into successful business. The local drinking scene is sweeter as a result. Nani Moon Meadery Fullscreen Six year-round bottlings are fashioned out of organic, locally harvested nectar. But don’t expect a mouthful of syrup. Deviant Beehavior, made with Hawaiian chili pepper and white pineapple evokes spiced, vegetal notes. Cacao Moon comes with threads of vanilla and sweet potato pie. Nani Moon Meadery The tasting room in Kapa’a — just a block from the beach — is open Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 5 p.m. Nani Moon Meadery Like this topic?
