And we should have fair trade, transparent trade, inclusive trade.” \nMa said that a globalised economy was more than just transactions of money and goods.

Trade of culture,” he said, adding that he felt a responsibility to fly more than 100,000km in the past month to promote global commerce. \nMa said that he had “a wonderful discussion” with Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull on Friday to discuss the possibility of Alibaba collaborating with the government to create a regional “e-hub”— a trade zone that would allow for freer online commerce with less border bureaucracy to deal with. \n“Most of the free trade zones in the past 20 years are designed for big companies,” he said. \n“If Australia, New Zealand and other countries can create a free trade zone in the form of an e-hub for small businesses, they can work like the big companies – with 24 hours clearance, better tariffs and quicker [border] inspections. That could help a lot of small businesses.” \nAlthough Turnbull was slated to attend, he was absent at the Melbourne launch and was represented by the federal innovation minister Arthur Sinodinos. Among the 350-strong crowd of business and political leaders at the event were Victorian premier Daniel Andrews and New Zealand economic development minister Simon Bridges. \nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , and Instagram .
