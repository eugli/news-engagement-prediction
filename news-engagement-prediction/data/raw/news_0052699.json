Why is losing three of our best players a good thing? \nThe answer, in short, is this: Ignore the immediate future. Try to look past that. \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball? Make sure you're in the loop — take five seconds to sign up for our FREE Vols newsletter now!) \nSuggesting that any football coach not named Urban Meyer , Nick Saban or Dabo Swinney is hot-seat-proof is silly, and suggesting that Tennessee’s Butch Jones is hot-seat-proof is really silly. We all know what could happen if Tennessee wins fewer than eight games next season. We all know that would, at the very least, warm up the cushion for Jones heading into the 2018 season. \nBarring a total collapse, though, Tennessee and Jones are financially wed to each other for the next couple of years. You can kick and scream all you want, but that won’t change the fact that the Vols have their coach for the next couple of years barring a total disaster.

Look at the first few classes they brought to Tennessee. Those classes were the backbone of a group that brought the Vols back to respectability on the national scene. That group won three consecutive bowl games and finished the past two seasons in the Associated Press top-25 poll. That’s not the kind of thing that’ll make anyone a Tennessee Legend — especially when you should have won the SEC Eastern Division in 2016 and didn’t — but it shouldn’t be ignored, either. \nLying under the surface the past couple of years, though, has been the Vols’ uncharacteristic cold streak in the NFL Draft. \nAfter having at least one player — and usually multiple players — drafted between 1964-2014, the Vols went through all seven rounds of the past two drafts without seeing any of their players taken off the board. \nOuch. That stings. \nCould any of that be pinned of Jones and his staff? No. Not really. Those draft classes were signed by predecessor Derek Dooley and his staff, and that staff was dismissed for a reason. You could make a reasonable-but-long-shot argument that a little better development from Jones and his staff could have changed that, but any rational person would give Jones and Co. a pass on those two draft-drought classes. \nStill, though, those two draft-drought years have been canon fodder for Tennessee’s rivals on the recruiting trail. Negative recruiting is a nasty thing, but practically every staff does it, and you're hopelessly naive if you think rivals staffs haven’t spent ample time the past two years reminding Tennessee recruits that the Vols haven’t had a single player drafted since 2014. \nYou’d also be hopelessly naive to think that hasn’t worked. \nAfter finishing No. 7 and No. 4 nationally in the 2014 and 2015 247Sports Team Recruiting Rankings, the Vols dipped to No. 14 and No. 17 nationally in the 2016 and 2017 247Sports Team Recruiting Rankings. And that No. 17 finish nationally in 2017 looks even worse when you consider how strong that class was in the state of Tennessee. No one’s ever going to sign all of the top players in their state, and the Vols have won more than they’ve lost with Volunteer State players they’ve really wanted during the Jones era, but they had a couple of stinging defeats with in-state stars in 2017. They landed the pick of the little in All-Everything, Five-Million-Star offensive tackle Trey Smith, but they whiffed on the No. 2, No. 3 and No. 4 players in the state, and one of those three — five-star wide receiver Tee Higgins — is a Knoxville-area high school standout who de-committed from the Vols to sign with Clemson. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) \nEvery year is its own year in recruiting, and every player’s recruiting process is unique in its own right, but I think you could make an argument that having two full seasons without a single player being drafted was a factor in Tennessee losing some of its top targets in 2017. Maybe I’m crazy, but I don’t think Tennessee in a normal year goes all-out on the top four prospects in its own state and lands only one of them. \nJones’ ability to understand kids and the way they think and the things that motivate them made him and his staff an immediate success on the recruiting trail, but let’s not forget that Jones and Co. had something really, really easy to sell at that point. They could virtually guarantee immediate playing time to any good prospect they wanted, and they weren’t lying. They needed so much help across the board that they weren’t selling snake oil to those kids. They could basically guarantee early playing time, and more often than not they were exactly right. Former Tennessee defensive end Derek Barnett (Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports) \nThose things got harder to sell in 2016 and 2017, though. Tennessee got stuck in a situation where it was a little too good to reasonably guarantee prospects immediate playing time but not good enough to show other things that prospects want to see: championship rings and NFL Draft proof. The Vols haven’t won the SEC East under Jones, and they didn’t have a single player selected in the past two NFL Drafts. That’s more than enough ammunition for rival coaches to light up Tennessee. \nSure, Tennessee players from the 2015 and 2016 draft classes stuck on NFL rosters, and Jones could fairly point to several players he coached at Central Michigan and Cincinnati becoming high-round NFL Draft picks and NFL stars. But nuance isn’t a language millennials have mastered, and depending on where you stand with the whole nature-versus-nurture thing, it’s easy to understand why some kids might have heard people talking about Tennessee going 0-for-2 with two whiffs in the past two NFL Drafts and having cause for pause about the Vols. \nAll of this should be about to change, though. \nSix Tennessee players — including non-seniors Barnett, Kamara and Malone — have been invited to next week’s NFL Combine in Indianapolis, and a couple of players who didn’t make that cut still could be drafted this year. And Barnett and possibly Kamara are first-round picks in many projections. \nTennessee’s NFL Draft status will be put back on its proper axis this year, and that will eliminate one of the two major things that have hurt the Vols in recruiting the past couple of years. \nAs for the other issue — the lack of championships — well … the jury remains out on that. \n\nContact Wes Rucker by email at wesrucker247@gmail.com or ON TWITTER , or FOLLOW GOVOLS247 ON FACEBOOK .
