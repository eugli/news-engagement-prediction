The callers would tell people they had won a lottery through a draw of phone numbers but would have to pay a small amount to get the money. \nThey would give them account numbers where the money could be sent. Several people seemed to be have fallen for the trick. \nPolice unearthed more than 250 accounts in 25 bank branches in Satna and Rewa districts where the money was parked. These accounts were managed by commission agents (acting as fund-clearing houses). \nAs soon as the money used to come into the accounts, their Pakistan handlers would ask Balram and Rajjan to withdraw it. \nThe withdrawn sum would then be transferred to accounts managed by Sanyog Singh in Old Delhi. Sanyog would take out the money and hand it over to 62-year-old Jama Masjid resident Abdul Jabbar, arrested in Delhi on Saturday night. \nJabbar, a garment exporter, would use hawala channels to move the money. \nJabbar’s family has denied the charges, saying he is being framed. \nWhile a portion of money handed over to him by Sanyog was routed by Jabbar through hawala operations, the remaining would be invested by him in his garment exports business in Delhi, sources said.
