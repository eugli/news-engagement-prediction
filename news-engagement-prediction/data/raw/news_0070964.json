(Photo: Nagarjuna Akkineni Twitter) \nHYDERABAD: Has the high-profile wedding of Telugu film superstar Nagarjuna's son Akhil Akkineni and Shriya Bhupal, granddaughter of industrialist G V K Reddy, been called off? \nSpeculation is rife, both in Tollywood and business circles, that Akkineni Nagarjuna and G V K Reddy, the heads of the two families, have reportedly called off the wedding. \nAkhil (22) and Shriya (26) were engaged in a lavish private ceremony at GVK House back December. The betrothal became the talk of the town and the rich and famous of Hyderabad were looking forward to the wedding in Italy in May this year. \nSources close to both families disclosed to New Indian Express that over the last few days many invitees who had already booked air tickets to Italy were asked to cancel them. \n“Messages went out last Saturday to guests to cancel their programme. No reason was given. Those who were about to book tickets were advised not to go ahead. Even the tickets booked by both families have been cancelled,” they said. \nThough the reasons for the cancellation off are not known, sources indicated it was a ''last minute decision.' One invitee who spoke to New Indian Express on condition of anonymity said it was a total surprise. “All was well until last week,” he said. \nAbout 700 guests were to fly to Rome for the destination wedding including several top industrialists, big names from the southern film industries, and some top stars from Bollywood. “A lot of preparations were made and everything was in place. Hotels and resorts were booked,” sources said. \nAkhil and Shriya had been seeing each other for almost two years before the December engagement. While Akhil has acted in a few movies, Shriya Bhupal is the official costume designer for a film magazine and has worked with Tollywood stars Kajal Agarwal and Shriya Saran besides Bollywood A listers like Shraddha Kapoor and Alia Bhatt.
