Steve King hasn't wasted any time jumping on the anti-immigrant, white nationalist Trump bandwagon. Now he apparently wants to make sure America is crystal clear about his support for white nationalism throughout the rest of the world, as well. x \nUS Congressmen King & Rohrabacher pay a visit to discuss Liberty & shared values w/(next president of France?) Marine Le Pen @MLP_officiel pic.twitter.com/UZEp8vWPNz â€” Steve King (@SteveKingIA) February 13, 2017 \nMarine Le Pen is, for newcomers, the white nationalist leader of the extremist-right French political party National Front . Her father was himself a notorious anti-Semite and Holocaust denier; she herself is a Trumpesque figure who demands immigrants be stripped of jobs, welfare, school rights, and all other government services in favor of native citizens. \nShe is anti-Muslim, of course, with all the usual trappings, and has called for the end of dual citizenship; French citizens who also hold citizenship in other nations, like Israel, would be forced to relinquish one or the other (with the exception of other European Union nations and, conspicuously, Russia.) \nHer campaign, like Trump's, has received the backing of Russian state hackers ; French intelligence agencies are bracing for further interventions . Like Trump, her campaign has responded by backing Putin, demanding the end of sanctions against Russia, and even defending the Russian invasion of Crimea. \nSo those are the \"shared values\" Rep. Steve King is celebrating as he dodges constituents back home to meet with Marine Le Pen instead. The Republicans aren't making it subtle anymore. They seem to believe they no longer need to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:30:50.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
