State and Kansas State, while Illinois, Georgia and NC State are all but done 22m ago â€¢ 5 min read \nSaturday was the biggest day yet this season for bubble teams in college basketball. There's a lot of games, and it can be hard to track. We're doing the work for you. To get a better idea of how teams helped or hurt themselves, scan the results below. As always, be sure to take a tour of our Bracketology hub as well. WINNERS Off the bubble ... for now (the good version) \nIowa State Cyclones (RPI: 52, KenPom: 26, Sagarin: 22) : The Cyclones (14-8) got the biggest win of the day and one of the most valuable wins this season by somehow going into Allen Fieldhouse and coming out with a 92-89 overtime win. This was just the 10th loss Bill Self's ever had at The Phog. Steve Prohm's team still has a lot of work to do, but this victory separates them from the noise for now. That changes if ISU can't get the job done in its next game. NEXT UP: at Texas Longhorns on Tuesday. \nXavier Musketeers (RPI: 15, KenPom: 28, Sagarin: 25) : The Musketeers (17-6), like Iowa State, went on the road and picked up a massive win. Xavier 82, Creighton Bluejays 80. Huge for Chris Mack's crew. X has a good record, but lacked wins over tournament-bound teams. No more. Sometimes, getting a legitimate resume takes until February. Creighton not having Mo Watson Jr. in this game doesn't matter -- because Xavier's lost Edmond Sumner for the year. NEXT UP: vs. DePaul Blue Demons on Wednesday. Stayed on the bubble thanks to victory \nSyracuse Orange (RPI: 84, KenPom: 50, Sagarin: 50) : The Orange (15-9), which I left for dead two weeks ago, have won four straight, including wins over Wake Forest Demon Deacons and NC State Wolfpack , both fellow bubble teams. SU's home win over Virginia Cavaliers was the necessary victory to vault this team into the at-large conversation. The Orange have to keep doing this, because they don't have one worthwhile win in non-conference play. NEXT UP: at Clemson Tigers on Tuesday. \nKansas State Wildcats (RPI: 53, KenPom: 29, Sagarin: 45) : The Wildcats (16-7) earned the second most impressive win of the day by snapping a three-game losing streak and managing to upset No. 2 Baylor Bears -- in Waco. Bruce Weber scheduled one of the worst non-conference slates this season, but now he has wins over West Virginia Mountaineers and Baylor to his name. This is becoming an intriguing team, but can it do the unthinkable and beat two top-five teams back to back? NEXT UP: vs. Kansas Jayhawks on Monday. \nMiami (RPI: 74, KenPom: 44, Sagarin: 46) : The Hurricanes (15-7) won at NC State, likely killing off the Wolfpack in the process. But remember, this team is still 1-7 against the eight best opponents it's faced. A lot left to prove, but winning on Saturday was nice filler. Road victories carry weight. NEXT UP: vs. Virginia Tech Hokies on Wednesday. \nSeton Hall Pirates (RPI: 48, KenPom: 54, Sagarin: 47) : The Pirates (14-8) got big-time performance out of Angel Delgado , who had a career-best 26 points and 17 rebounds. Desi Rodriguez hit the winning shot and this win came on the road against Georgetown Hoyas , which is now in a tight spot. This was SHU's first road W of the year in the league. Delgado, averaging 13.1 boards, is the nation's leading rebounder. NEXT UP: vs. Providence Friars on Wednesday. \nMinnesota Golden Gophers (RPI: 23, KenPom: 41, Sagarin: 40) : The Golden Gophers (16-7) finally stop the skid. This was the team's first win since Jan. 8! By beating Illinois Fighting Illini 68-59, it kicks off a very winnable stretch ahead for this group. NCAA Tournament very much a probable thing -- as long as they don't take any more bad losses. NEXT UP: vs. Iowa Hawkeyes on Wednesday. \nWake Forest (RPI: 32, KenPom: 34, Sagarin: 39) : The Demon Deacons (14-9) are loved by the metrics but lack, for me, enough high-quality wins to validate them as a NCAA Tournament team. Still, beating Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets on Saturday kept them in the mix. NEXT UP: at Notre Dame Fighting Irish on Tuesday. \nVCU Rams (RPI: 31, KenPom: 47, Sagarin: 44) : The Rams (18-5) got a controversial win on Saturday night at St. Bonaventure. I wrote on Friday, \" The Atlantic 10 needs VCU to win this game.\" Welp ... it happened! VCU 83, Bona 77, in overtime. The league is flirting with being just a two-bid league this season. Rams definitely have the talent to win in March. NEXT UP: at George Washington Colonials on Wednesday. LOSERS Off the bubble ... for now (the bad version) \nNC State (RPI: 83, KenPom: 86, Sagarin: 85) : This could be it for the Wolfpack (14-10). That win at Duke Blue Devils was aberrational. Mark Gottfried's team fell at home 84-79 to a Miami team that was also in a spot of needing a win. After starting 11-2 this season, NCSU is 3-8 in the ACC. Massively disappointing team. NEXT UP: at Florida State Seminoles on Wednesday. \nGeorgia Bulldogs (RPI: 51, KenPom: 51, Sagarin: 59) : The Bulldogs (13-10) are probably done for good, barring a huge win streak, and they're so close to being really in the mix. Mark Fox's team almost knocked off Kentucky Wildcats in Rupp earlier this week, and on Saturday UGA fell by two at South Carolina Gamecocks . NEXT UP: vs. Florida Gators on Tuesday. \nGeorgetown (RPI: 54, KenPom: 59, Sagarin: 57) : The Hoyas (13-11) are now going to be fighting to get into the NIT. By blowing a home game against Seton Hall, the losses are overwhelming the fact G'town's beaten Oregon Ducks , Syracuse, Creighton and Butler Bulldogs . And it doesn't get any easier. Tuesday's game will determine if Georgetown has any shot of getting an at-large. NEXT UP: at Villanova Wildcats on Tuesday. \nIllinois (RPI: 58, KenPom: 71, Sagarin: 66) : The Illini (13-11) are one of many teams that took just devastating losses on Saturday. Illinois couldn't get the job done at home -- against a fellow bubble team -- and that makes it even tougher to swallow. This team will now fight for an NIT bid. NEXT UP: at Northwestern Wildcats on Tuesday. \nTennessee Volunteers (RPI: 36, KenPom: 36, Sagarin: 34) : The Volunteers (13-10) hopped onto the radar with that win over Kentucky on Jan. 24, but you can't realistically have the Vols anywhere near the field at this point, even if their computer numbers are strong. UT fell 64-59 at Mississippi State Bulldogs on Saturday, and Rick Barnes' team needs at least two more top-50 type wins. NEXT UP: vs. Ole Miss on Wednesday. Still on bubble, despite losing Saturday \nGeorgia Tech (RPI: 69, KenPom: 37, Sagarin: 62) : The Yellow Jackets (13-10) have really nice wins (UNC, Florida State, Notre Dame), but they've all come at home. Having 10 losses is also very problematic. If they'd won at Wake on Saturday, it would've been a real conversation about putting them in the field. For now, they're in uncertain waters but definitely still on the bubble because of those Ws. NEXT UP: vs. Boston College Eagles on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:46:03.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
