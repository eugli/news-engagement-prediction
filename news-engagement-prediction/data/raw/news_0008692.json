On Tuesday (Jan. 31), the company announced it had acquired the European-based Ticketscript and today they are launching Eventbrite Venue, an \"integrated booking, operations and ticketing solution for live music venues.\"\nThe Ticketscript acquisition positions Eventbrite as Europe's third-largest ticket provider, according to the San-Francisco-based company. Operating in the European market last year the two firms processed more than 35 million tickets worth over €500 million ($628.5 million) for nearly a million events. Ticketscript is based in Amsterdam and is active in five markets: the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium. Following the acquisition, for which terms were not disclosed, a quarter of Eventbrite’s global employees will work in Europe.\nThe newly announced Eventbrite Venue combines the functionality of Queue, a company acquired by Eventbrite in early 2016, with the U.S. ticketing company's technology into a interface that enables venues to manage every aspect of a show from booking artists to selling tickets to settling up with artists and more.\nRead more: Eventbrite and Bandsintown Announce Partnership: Exclusive\n\"We jumped on the Queue train early because we could see how intelligent the product was,\" Texas-based promoter Graham Williams of Margin Walker Presents told Billboard . \"Gaining efficiencies across 28 different venues and booking 750 shows each year makes a huge impact to our bottom line. We’ve been using the product since its inception and we don’t know how we would do business without it. Having it fully integrated with Eventbrite will be the icing on the cake.\"\n\"We acquired Queue because it’s a superior product that solves a glaring pain point for venues, built by a team of expert engineers who had all moonlit as live music promoters, venue managers, and talent bookers,” said Julia Hartz , Eventbrite ceo and co-founder, in a statement. \"Eventbrite Venue replaces up to five different systems with one single interface, specifically designed for event producers, enabling them to focus on delivering incredible live music experiences.\"\nRead more: Eventbrite and Bandsintown Announce Partnership: Exclusive\nEventbrite has 11 offices in eight countries and investors that include Sequoia Capital, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price. It handles ticketing for a number of music festivals including Newport Folk and Jazz Festivals, Okeechobee and Sound on Sound Fest. The company's venue clients include Chicago's Lincoln Hall and Schubas Tavern, San Francisco's Slim's and Great American Music Hall and Austin's Mohawk and Sidewinder.", "external_links": ["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/biz/articles/news/digital-and-mobile/7603799/eventbrite-and-bandsintown-announce-partnership"], "published": "2017-02-01T16:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:59:04.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
