(© Keith Bedford / Reuters/REUTERS) The central facts of the case remained the same. Since Etan's body was never found and there were no witnesses to his abduction, the verdict revolved around Hernandez’s confession and the circumstances of the child’s disappearance.\nThere were some subtle differences in the retrial, however.\nJury has mulled charges for accused Etan Patz killer for 5 days \nThe defense chose not to call to the stand two jailhouse informants who obtained confessions from a different suspect in the killing, Jose Ramos.\nNor did the defense call a federal prosecutor, Stuart GraBois, who pursued Ramos for years.\nThe decision was a strategic one. The defense attacked the reliability of Hernandez's confession and pursued an alternate suspect defense — still pointing the finger at Ramos.\n16 photos view gallery Etan Patz case The witnesses they declined to call to support the Ramos theory were not necessary, they felt, and would have been hounded on cross-examination.\nEtan Patz killer staked out boy before killing him: prosecutors \nBut Hernandez’s confession remained the main hurdle for the defense.\nIn disturbing detail, the defendant admitted luring the little boy to the bodega where he worked at West Broadway and Prince St. in SoHo.\nThe child was walking alone for the first time to his school bus stop at the same corner.\nThe 38-year-old case caused a national furor at the time, and became a permanent part of the city's psyche. Etan became one of the first missing children to be pictured on milk cartons.\nAttorneys for Pedro Hernandez said he was mentally ill and suffered from delusions that lead him to falsely believe he killed Etan Patz. (Louis Lanzano/ASSOCIATED PRESS) No one went to trial until Hernandez confessed.\nLawyers for Hernandez argued the damning admissions were the result of a seven-hour police interrogation that cops did not record.\nThey said Hernandez’s mental illness and history of delusions lead him to falsely believe he was responsible.\nHernandez has an IQ of just 70 and a mental disorder similar to schizophrenia.\nSome of the 11 jurors who had wanted to convicted Hernandez during the first trial attended portions of the redo trial, including summations. They also consulted with prosecutors as they re-framed their case.\nEtan’s father, Stanley Patz, attended each day of both trials. (Alec Tabak/for New York Daily News) The lone holdout juror, Adam Sirois, gave pointers to the defense.\nAs the new jury began deliberation Sirois said he remained certain he’d reached the right verdict.\n\"I sleep fine at night. I feel like I did the right thing. My conscious is clear,” he said.\nHernandez’s confession was not credible, he added.\n\"I feel it was a statement made under duress and by a man who has severe mental health issues, low intelligence, poor memory,” he said.\nTags: etan patz new york murders crimes against children  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T19:57:40.709+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
