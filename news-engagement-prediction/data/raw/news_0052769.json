The actor figures in an advertisement to promote tourism for a wild ass sanctuary in Gujarat, Modi’s home state.

Jitna kaam le lo karta hai aur kam se kam kharche wala hota hai (A donkey is loyal to its owner. It can take an immense workload and has low maintenance cost).” \n“Akhileshji yeh 125 crore deshwaasi mere maalik hain. Woh mujhse jitna kaam lete hain main karta hoon … gadhe se bhi zyada kaam karke unke liye kaam aaon yeh mere liye gaurav ki baat hai (Akhileshji the country’s 1.25 billion people are my masters. I feel proud to slog for the people),” he said. Read more UP elections 2017: All parties say they’re winning. Here’s how they reason \nModi slammed Akhilesh for targeting Gujarat’s donkeys. \n“Akhileshji, the Gujarat you hate so much is the state where Dayanand Saraswati, Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel were born … where Lord Krishna chose to settle. This is our country, this much hate doesn’t suit you.” \nAkhilesh and Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, who have formed an alliance with the ruling Samajwadi Party before the Uttar Pradesh elections, have been accusing Modi of spreading hatred to polarise voters. \nAppealing for change, Modi accused the SP government of converting Bahraich, which derives its name from Brahma of the holy Hindu trinity, into a den of corruption. \nThe chief minister’s donkey jibe has upset the Prajapati community — people who washed laundry traditionally — in Aligarh. “We are in shock. Donkeys are as important for our livelihood as cows are for Yadavs,” said Rajan Singh, president of the Prajapati Samaj Sangharsh Samiti, a social rights group of the community. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:27:11.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
