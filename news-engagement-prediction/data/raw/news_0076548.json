But before you start popping pills, try these 14 natural remedies. They’re simple, doctor-recommended ways to reduce suffering now and stay headache-free in the future... Headaches can be painful, worrisome and downright debilitating. But before you head for the medicine cabinet for over-the-counter painkillers, why not add some natural remedies to your pain-relief arsenal? They’re more effective than you might expect. “Many women who suffer from headaches aren’t aware of the various alternative remedies available to them,” Brian Grosberg, MD, co-director of the headache center at the Montefiore Headache Center in the Bronx, N.Y. Some are immediate solutions to use when your head is pounding, while others are meant to head off headaches long-term. Of course, if you suffer from frequent or severe headaches, you should see your doctor. But for occasional pain, the following 14 treatments can help. 1. Apply an ice pack. This tried-and-true method – also known as cryotherapy – is a proven way to dull headache pain. Experts suspect that the cold helps constrict blood vessels around the scalp and slows the rate at which nerves transmit pain signals. Place the ice pack over areas of the most intense pain as well as the upper neck, advises Frederick Freitag, DO, associate professor at the Medical College of Wisconsin and former director of headache medicine at Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas. You can also buy gel packs or use a bag of frozen peas. 2. Kick the butts. With each puff of a cigarette, you’re breathing in at least 4,000 chemicals and raising your risk for heart disease, stroke, aneurysm and cancer. Smoking also does other nasty things, such as increasing blood pressure, decreasing circulation, inflaming sinus cavities and nasal passages, and shrinking blood vessels, all of which can add up to headaches, Dr. Grosberg says. Even secondhand smoke can cause the brain’s blood vessels to narrow. So stop smoking – or help your friend quit. Call 1-800-QUITNOW (1-800-784-8669) to reach your state’s quit line. 3. Have a snack. When you develop a headache during a long, pressure-filled day, it’s easy to blame stress. But the reason could be that you didn’t eat. Your brain runs on two things – glucose, which comes from food you eat, and oxygen. “When it doesn’t get enough of either, the brain fires up pain-sensitive neurons to tell you its needs aren’t getting met,” Dr. Freitag explains. No matter how busy you are, aim to eat something at least every 4-6 hours. (Try 5-6 mini-meals instead of three big ones.) Choose meals that combine complex carbohydrates with protein, which take longer to digest than a candy bar. Good snacks for headache prevention include turkey and whole-wheat crackers or peanut butter and banana (bananas are good sources of magnesium, an essential mineral for fending off headaches). Here are more ideas for smart, healthy snacking . 4. Press pain away. Acupressure is an ancient healing art that you can do yourself by using fingertips to press key points, says Michael Seidman, MD, division director of otologic/neurotologic surgery and medical director of wellness at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. For general headaches, try this: Use your thumb and index finger to squeeze the flesh between your other hand’s thumb and index finger, about half an inch in from where they connect. Squeeze gently and massage in small, circular motions for one to two minutes. Switch hands and repeat. Studies have shown mixed results on the benefits of acupuncture for preventing migraine, according to the December 2013 issue of the International Journal of Neurology & Neurosurgery . (Don’t do this during pregnancy, because it’s also thought to stimulate uterine contractions.) 5. Gulp a glass of water. Dehydration is a common trigger for migraines and other headaches. Without enough water, blood becomes thicker and doesn’t flow as easily, while blood vessels narrow, reducing the brain’s oxygen supply. So when your head hurts, down a big glass of water to hydrate yourself, Dr. Freitag suggests. In general, drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water a day. And add in plenty of water-filled fruits and veggies like cucumber, celery and watermelon. 6. Stop taking headache medicine. Some pain relievers may actually make headaches worse. Overusing over-the-counter remedies with caffeine and antihistamines or prescription pain-relief narcotics can interfere with the brain’s pain-regulation messages and lower your pain threshold, Dr. Grosberg says. And overuse of painkillers such as aspirin or acetaminophen can result in “rebound headaches.” When the medications stop effectively relieving pain, you may take more pain medicine, which continues the cycle. If you take headache medicine more than two days a week, see your doctor about how to wean yourself. 7. Banish trigger foods and food additives. Certain foods contain an amino acid called tyramine that can trigger migraines by constricting and then expanding blood vessels, Dr. Freitag says. These include aged or ripened cheeses such as cheddar, brie, blue, Parmesan, Swiss, feta, gorgonzola, mozzarella and muenster. Luncheon meats such as bologna and salami contain both tyramine and certain food additives, which increase blood flow to the brain in some people. Red wine and alcoholic beverages also contain tyramine. Leftovers can sometimes develop tyramine as they age – even foods that would otherwise be tyramine-free, such as hamburger or shrimp. According to the Cleveland Clinic, nitrates and nitrites are among the worst additives (or preservatives) and are found in: Ham Other cured or processed meats The Cleveland Clinic has also identified these foods as triggers by some headache sufferers: Peanuts, peanut butter, other nuts and seeds Pizza or other tomato-based products Potato chip products Chicken livers and other organ meats, pate Smoked or dried fish Pickled foods (pickles, olives, sauerkraut) Sourdough bread, fresh baked yeast goods (donuts, cakes, homemade breads, and rolls) Brewer’s yeast found in natural supplements Bread, crackers, and desserts containing cheese Most beans including lima, Italian, pole, broad, fava, navy, pinto, snow peas, garbanzo, lentils, and dried beans and peas Onions Certain fresh fruits including ripe bananas, citrus fruits, papaya, red plums, raspberries, kiwi, pineapple Dried fruits (figs, raisins, dates) Soups made from meat extracts or bouillon (not homemade broth) Cultured dairy products, sour cream, buttermilk, yogurt Chocolate If you think your diet may be the culprit, keep a food diary to see which ones set off your headaches. 8. Cut out diet soda. Sugar-free products may help keep your waistline slim, but they may also make your head hurt. The artificial sweetener aspartame – found in most soft drinks – remains one of the most controversial food additives. This is due to mixed evidence on its health effects, including headaches, according a 2014 study published in the journal Research in Nursing & Health . If you drink diet soda and have headaches, try abstaining for a while to see if that helps. Diet sodas also pose other health hazards. 9. Go for a walk. Regular exercise heads off headaches by lowering stress levels and boosting natural pain-killing chemicals known as endorphins, Dr. Freitag says. It can also help you sleep better. Aim for 30-45 minutes of brisk physical activity, 3-4 days a week. Unfortunately, exercise can also cause headaches for some people. If you occasionally get one during or after workouts, make sure you’re eating and drinking enough and that you aren’t exercising too vigorously for your fitness level. If the headaches persist, see your doctor. 10. Get your zzz’s. Better sleep habits can sometimes head off a migraine or tension headache. “Sleep is the ‘control-alt-delete’ toggle for your brain’s restart,” Dr. Freitag says. The association between headache and sleep disorders was recognized over a century ago, according to Headache: the Journal of Head and Face Pain . Numerous studies have supported the need for sleep to reduce or perhaps eliminate headaches. Aim for eight hours a night. You may find that soothing music can help you fall asleep. Bonus: Experts believe that calming music can also relieve muscle and headache pain. 11. Try some butterbur. The name of this perennial shrub is attributed to the large leaves being used to wrap butter during warm weather. But these days it’s used for more than wrapping butter. Butterbur from the daisy family, sold in health food stores, is known for its anti-inflammatory properties. It can relieve spasms and decrease swelling in the head. But Dr. Grosberg warns that unrefined butterbur root contains potentially liver-damaging alkaloids. He recommends only taking an extract with those ingredients removed. The Migraine Trust research and advocacy organization suggests the detoxified herb marketed under the brand name Petadolex®, along with other commercially available butterbur products that are free of alkaloids when they are used short-term and in recommended doses. Consult with your doctor before trying this or any other herb to make sure it’s safe for you, especially if you are taking medications for your headaches or another health condition and may not be aware of possible interactions. Also ask your doctor about the dosage that’s right for you. Long-term health effects and interaction with other drugs have not been studied so it is not yet known if there are any side effects from long-term use, according to the Migraine Trust. 12. Stuff yourself with spinach. Popeye knew the secret to warding off headaches: Eat plenty of spinach, which is high in the mineral magnesium, which prevents blood vessels from going into spasms. As many as half the people who experience acute migraine attacks have low blood levels of magnesium, says Alexander Mauskop, MD, director and founder of the New York Headache Center in New York City. Other magnesium-rich foods include whole grains, tofu, fish, seeds, avocados, spices, nuts, cereals, coffee, cocoa, tea, and vegetables. Leafy vegetables (like spinach), as well as grains and nuts, generally have higher magnesium content than meats and dairy products. 13. Pat on some peppermint. Peppermint has long been used as an alternative treatment for headaches, cough, colds, sinus infections and more. Peppermint oil may be effective for tension headaches, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). You can buy peppermint oil in many health-food stores. Gently rub a few drops into your forehead, temples, and back of the jaw and neck when your head is pounding – but keep it away from eyes to avoid irritation. 14. Picture less pain. An imagination technique known as guided imagery can relieve headaches, Seidman says. Try this: Close your eyes, breathe deeply and relax. Imagine that the headache is a liquid that fills a cup – the more painful the headache, the bigger the cup. Picture it as clearly as you can. Now, in your mind, pour the headache pain into a slightly smaller cup, but don’t let any liquid overflow. Then again, pour it into a slightly smaller cup. Continue until you can barely see it. Bit by bit, you should feel pain fade. For more information on headaches and headache treatment, visit Lifescript’s Headache & Migraine Health Center .
