Everett Patrick, the director of employment services, will become the interim chief human capital management officer until the district finds a permanent replacement.\nBrown has not been seen in the office since before the district’s winter break. He missed two board meetings and has made more than $30,000 of his annual $175,000 salary without reporting to work. District officials have not addressed the absence, only saying after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Brown’s mysterious absence that he was still employed by the district.\nDistrict officials have not said whether the new position affects Brown’s salary or whether he will physically report to work.\nBrown came to the district from Emory University Hospital in December 2015 as the district’s interim chief human capital management officer. He previously worked with Superintendent Steve Green at Kansas City Public Schools as that district’s chief human capital management officer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:11:14.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
