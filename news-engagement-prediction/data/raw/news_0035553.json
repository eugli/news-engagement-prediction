Last month, following the cable news channel’s report on him being presented with a two-page synopsis on the infamous Russia dossier during an intel briefing, Trump took to labeling CNN “fake news.” \nWell, it now appears that the Trump Administration is taking its complaints to CNN’s corporate bosses. According to the Wall Street Journal , Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner met with a Time Warner executive to protest CNN’s reporting. \nIn a meeting at the White House, Mr. Kushner complained to Gary Ginsberg, executive vice president of corporate marketing and communications at CNN’s parent Time Warner, about what Mr. Kushner feels is unfair coverage slanted against the president, the people said. \nThe Trump administration’s hostile posture toward the news media, especially CNN, has been evident in the president’s own statements and those of his press secretary and top aides. On Thursday, Mr. Trump lashed into CNN once again at a news conference, calling it “very fake news” with expert commentary that is “almost exclusively anti-Trump.” \nThe WSJ story also stated that Kushner has been “pushing the issue” with other Time Warner execs, including CNN president Jeff Zucker . \nDuring today’s press conference, Trump openly railed against CNN, specifically singling out anchor Don Lemon over what he felt was “hatred and venom” coming from the host’s mouth. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:14:38.861+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
