Same-store sales declined 1.5%, also missing estimates for a 1.3% decline. For comparison, Walmart U.S. delivered a same-store sales gain of 1.8% during the fourth quarter, propelled by lower prices in food.\nTarget said it sees full-year earnings of $3.80 to $4.20 a share, markedly below analysts' forecasts of $5.34.\n\"Our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of rapidly changing consumer behavior, which drove very strong digital growth but unexpected softness in our stores,\" said Brian Cornell, chairman and CEO of Target. \"We will invest in lower gross margins to ensure we are clearly and competitively priced every day. While the transition to this new model will present headwinds to our sales and profit performance in the short term, we are confident that these changes will best-position Target for continued success over the long term.\"\nTarget also warned that it was transitioning to a new \"financial model,\" giving no early indications of what that exactly means. But it will likely include a serious investment in lower prices across the board to better compete with grocery stores and online rivals such as Amazon ( AMZN ) .\nDespite Target warning of a weak holiday season earlier in the year, the magnitude of the fourth-quarter earnings shortfall, lackluster guidance and comments from Cornell stunned Wall Street, which sent shares of Target down as much as 12% in premarket trading.\nHere are several things TheStreet will be looking for from Target while attending its investor day on Tuesday. To be sure, executives will have some explaining to do.\nWhat's up with the grocery aisle?\nFood sales represent more than 20% of Target's business, and it's vital that it finally gets this business right. Same-store sales were pressured throughout last year, as the company battled with pricing strategies in a competitive backdrop. Further, Target continues to deal with not having a broad enough assortment in fresh categories such as fruit, vegetables and meat and deli.\nThe retailer has to decide whether it wants to be a grocery store and, if so, how it could do it more effectively. Becoming a successful grocer could lift sales throughout the store. Target may want to consider outsourcing its grocery department to a Whole Foods ( WFM ) (using its new 365 value banner) in the same fashion as it outsourced its pharmacy business to CVS Health ( CVS ) . Let someone with the expertise in food service handle the business, freeing up Target to focus on what it does best -- higher quality general merchandise compared with Walmart at good prices.\nDoes the store base need to be pruned?\nWhile most of retail has been in store-closing mode over the past three years (including 100 Walmart store closures in early 2016), Target has stayed relatively firm with the number of stores it operates. But as J.C. Penney's ( JCP ) thought reversal on the size of its store base signals , even profitable retailers should be rethinking the sizes of their businesses right now. And seeing as Target has been underperforming its plan (and badly), one can't help but to think there are clusters of stores that deserve to be shuttered for the greater good of the bottom line.\nIt would be nice to get some clarity on that on Tuesday.\nWhat is this new financial model?\nBased on Target's 2017 guidance, it may now be taking the position it's a true discount retailer in the same mold of Walmart. That will take some getting used to by Wall Street, who will likely pepper executives on how Target plans to morph into a Walmart-like price leader.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:29:59.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
