(Photo: Columbia Pictures) \nThe term \"Groundhog Day\" took on a new and very different meaning with the release of the Bill Murray movie of that name in 1993. \nNo longer referring just to a buck-toothed rodent weather indicator, Groundhog Day now means a \"broken record-ness\" to life.A pounding, unrelenting, unchanging over-and-overness. \nTo celebrate Groundhog Day these days means to embrace repetition. Here, then, are seven local establishments that would be appropriate places to do that this Tuesday, regardless of whether Punxsutawney Phil sees his shadow. \nDugout , 621 Virginia Ave. \nFounded in the 1950s, the Dugout continues to do what taverns did during Eisenhower: sell bologna sandwiches and Pabst Blue Ribbon beer ($2.50 a pint). \nGolden Ace Inn , 2533 E. Washington St. Buy Photo \n(Photo: Kelly Wilkinson/IndyStar) \nPhotos of John F. Kennedy hang on the wall alongside photos of Notre Dame football, one dating from 1913. The menu is posted on the wall and includes Braunschweiger. \nWorkingman's Friend , 234 N. Belmont Ave. Buy Photo \n(Photo: Kelly Wilkinson/IndyStar) \nFounded 1918. Here, the Sloe Gin Fizz is still available, as is Braunschweiger. The tavern still proudly serves the \"Big John,\" a sandwich invented by the current proprietor's father during the Kennedy Administration and named for a Jimmy Dean single that was charting at the time. \nHollyhock Hill , 8110 N. College Ave. Buy Photo \n(Photo: IndyStar file photo) \nOpened in 1928, known for \"family-style\" dining. Diners pass around the food — fried chicken, green beans, mashed potatoes, beets, cottage cheese — like they do in Norman Rockwell paintings. The restaurant was sold in late 2016 but, so far anyway, Hollyhock soldiers on business-as-usual under the new ownership. \nMarco's Restaurant & Lounge , 2380 E. 54th St. \nThe mid-century \"Goodfellas\" vibe makes the place feel like 1966. The candles on the tables accentuate the darkly-lit, leisure-suited charm of the place. \nIron Skillet , 2489 W. 30th St. Buy Photo \n(Photo: Tom Klubens/IndyStar) \nThe staid, Eisenhower vibe remains from the restaurant's 1953 opening. It's like going to eat with your grandparents which, irony aside, was nice — white tablecloths, white linen napkins (starched), those narrow glasses of tomato juice for starters. \nPasquale's Pizza , 3623 W. 16th St. \nIt opened in 1963, when pizza was new in the U.S., and it looks like it did then. Glossy photos of the grand opening line the walls. (There were clowns.) Toppings include sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms. Brussels sprouts need not apply. \nContact Star reporter Will Higgins at (317) 444-6043.
