U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, left, discusses President Donald Trump's new immigraiton policy with Pembroke Pines Mayor Frank Ortis, Sunrise Commissioner Joey Scuotto and Broward County Commissioner Nan Rich. (Anthony Man) Anthony Man administration’s new plan to accelerate deportations, a visibly angry U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , D-Weston, denounced the policies as unjust, unconstitutional and inhumane.\nWasserman Schultz, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, is no fan of President Donald Trump, and said the new rules rolled out this week are among the worst things he’s done since taking office on Jan. 20. “There’s a long list of pretty terrible things that have happened in the Trump administration so far. This is definitely among the worst.” \nShe pledged to do everything she could to counter the new policies, including opposing the spending authority Trump would need to hire 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and 5,000 new Customs and Border Patrol Agents. “I’m going to fight. I’m going to stand up for the values of this community,” Wasserman Schultz promised. \nShe rejected the idea that the policy is OK because Trump won the presidency after promising during the campaign to get tough on illegal immigration. “It doesn’t mater whether we should have expected it,” she said. “You have to fight injustice wherever you can.” \nThe congresswoman spoke after her briefing with representatives from ICE, CPB and the Department of Justice, some of whom met with her in person in a conference room in Sunrise and some on the phone from Washington, D.C. It was held behind closed doors, she said, at the insistence of agency representatives. \nWasserman Schultz then met with six local elected officials from Broward County, and then continued her criticism of the new policy in a news conference.

She said the new policy would lead to “roundups” with and “dramatically expand” the number of people who are arrested, detained and deported. \n“There will now be a very significant expansion of the detention and deportation proceedings begun against people who have not committed a crime and have not done anything other than come here in an undocumented way and have done nothing other than be here to make a better life for their families,” Wasserman Schultz said. \nUnder former President Barack Obama, immigration enforcement targeted people convicted of crimes. “Now you can either be accused of a crime but not yet convicted or be someone participating in the ‘essential elements of a crime,’ whatever that means, and still be subject to detention and deportation if you are undocumented. And that is a dramatic expansion,” she said. “If you are here in the United States, the Constitution says you are innocent until proven guilty.” \nBroward Commissioner Nan Rich said told Wasserman Schultz she was concerned about what would happen to people — such as domestic violence victims — who might be afraid to have any interaction with police. “Everywhere I go people are afraid,” Rich said. “The bottom line is that they are tearing families apart.” \nWasserman Schultz said that under the new policy if someone gives an ICE agent without a warrant permission to enter a home, then undocumented people discovered there could be swept up and ultimately deported. She declined to offer a recommendation on whether people should refuse entrance to agents, but said she would not personally allow a warrant-less agent or police officer into her home unless she knew why they were there and it had nothing to do with a crime that could result in charges. \nThe result, Wasserman Schultz said, would be to force undocumented immigrants “back into the shadows,” with some afraid to report domestic violence, send their children to school or seek medical care. “They aren’t going to take their sick babies to the emergency room,” she said. \nIn South Florida, the issue isn’t divided along Democratic and Republican lines.

Lois Frankel , D-West Palm Beach, and Frederica Wilson , D-Miami — and by Miami-Dade County Republicans Carlos Curbelo and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:42:25.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
