The unit is furnished with a shower, a toilet, hot water, heat and air conditioning, but more importantly, it comes equipped with hope.\nThroughout his life, the 41-year-old account manager has come across men and women in poverty-stricken areas covered in grime, lacking basic human needs like clean water and clothing. \"If I saw a homeless person in the street I would always try to have some kind of interaction with them,\" he said. \"No one asks to be homeless, so if I could help them in any way, I did.\" In 2016, Winter's fervor to help turned into a free-service program called \"Hope Thru Soap.\" It offers an alternative to homeless shelters' jam-packed lavatories. His nonprofit, with a healthy social media following, has a simple mission: to offer \"showers and love to those in need.\" The mobile unit comes with a shower, a toilet, hot water, heat and air conditioning. One \" Hope Thru Soap \" user, Nathan, lost his home recently and found the mobile unit while walking through a park. He hadn't showered in three days. Read More \"I am really feeling refreshed and I thank God for [Jason] for bringing this shower to us,\" he said in a Facebook post. \"So much dirt came off of me.\" \"Something as small as a shower gives them hope,\" said Winter. \"When you're clean you're less likely to want to sleep under a bridge. A shower might make them want to get out and find work.\" Free baths require a water supply and toiletries. Until now, Winter has scraped funds out of his own pocket to pay for it. He is trying to raise $10,000 for supplies and a fire hydrant meter, which would allow him unlimited water from any hydrant in the city. \"It's a great feeling to help these people but I don't do it for myself,\" said Winter. \"I do it for the folks that can't speak for themselves and don't really have hope left. We bring them hope.\"", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/HopeThruSoap/"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:56:31.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
