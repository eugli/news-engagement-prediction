The only problem? Wan expressed that thought via the medium of a #Batman metaphor... How about we get Batman established properly first, before we cram in Robin. https://t.co/RlX3YiWelB — James Wan (@creepypuppet) February 20, 2017 \n...and, somewhat inevitably, a small section of the internet didn't get that at all : @creepypuppet @JaeRoar Batman has been \"for 20 years\" already.. — Rohan Gregor (@RohanGregor17) February 20, 2017 @brandonslagle @RohanGregor17 @creepypuppet @JaeRoar I think a good story could do that itself while introducing Robin story. — Marco Antonio Njera (@manthx) February 20, 2017 \nWhich, because James Wan apparently hasn't yet had his heart paved with the requisite stone to survive social media, led to the director being mildly yet politely infuriated: Duuudeee, that's not what I...(sigh)...never mind. https://t.co/cDG66scE4r — James Wan (@creepypuppet) February 20, 2017 \nWhich is actually a pretty perfect response when you think about it, especially since the Twitterer to whom he was responding was totally on board with Wan's bit: @creepypuppet Lmao I was just joking, I completely understand. — Plasma (@Plasma9Snake) February 20, 2017 \nAll of which should teach us all three key lessons: 1) All Batman-related analogies and metaphors will be misconstrued by at least one person on the internet, 2) Twitter trolls are a pain in the butt, even when they don't have access to nuclear codes, and 3) Aqualad almost certainly isn't going to be turning up in the #DCEU anytime soon. \nBut, then again, we already knew all of that, right? \nWhat do you think, though? Are you upset that we won't be seeing Aqualad in Aquaman ? Let us know below!
