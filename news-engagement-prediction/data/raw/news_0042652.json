(Photo: Raymond Carlin III, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nContinuity reigns on the Power Five level. Oklahoma is a Big 12 Conference powerhouse, having captured seven of the past 11 league titles. Alabama owns the Southeastern Conference. Florida State and Clemson have been the undisputed leaders in the Atlantic Coast Conference for much of the decade. \nIn comparison, it’s almost common — if at least not too surprising — to see a Group of Five program quickly rebuild itself with one key hire, or through impressive player development, or even with a fortuitous stroke of luck on the recruiting trail. \nWestern Michigan provides the latest example. The Broncos won just a single game four seasons ago, in former coach P.J. Fleck’s debut; this past fall, WMU completed a perfect regular season, earning a spot in the Cotton Bowl and Fleck a major-conference gig at Minnesota. \nThe Broncos weren’t the first to pull of this turnaround — Boise State, TCU, Utah and several others have done the same since the turn of the century — and they won’t be the last. This week’s top 10 list asks the question: Which Group of Five team fresh off a losing season is primed to streak into bowl play in 2017? \nThere are no shortage of options. But the list begins with a team from the American Athletic Conference poised to contend for a divisional title behind a coach seemingly destined to follow Fleck’s path to a Power Five position. \nMORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL Alabama hires Patriots assistant Brian Daboll to run offense 1. SMU (2016 record: 5-7) \nChad Morris enters his third season at Southern Methodist with the roster, depth and experience needed to notch the program’s first bowl bid since 2012. It hasn’t been an easy path: Morris inherited a wreck from his predecessor, making last year’s 5-7 finish — the Mustangs were 5-5 before losing two in a row to end the year — a clear sign that a winning season is on the near horizon. Don’t be surprised if SMU takes a significant step forward in 2017. 2. Georgia Southern (2016 record: 5-7) \nDespite its status as a Football Bowl Subdivision neophyte — a period coming on the heels of lower-level dominance as part of the Southern Conference — Georgia Southern shares one trait with its Power Five colleagues: For the Eagles, a five-win season is a disaster. So Tyson Summers’ debut in 2016 was, in a word, disastrous. But Summers’ decision to hire Georgia Tech assistant Bryan Cook as his offensive coordinator represents a belated embrace of the same option offense that first lifted the Eagles to national prominence. Better late than never. Look for GSU to return to the top third of the Sun Belt Conference. 3. Northern Illinois (2016 record: 5-7) \nThe temperature under Rod Carey’s seat went from warm to a rolling boil during the course of the 2016 season, the program’s first outside of the postseason since 2007. With Western Michigan, Toledo, Eastern Michigan and Central Michigan all returning bowl teams from a year ago, it might be a stretch to peg the Huskies to cruise back into the 10-win range. But the baseline should be set at seven or eight wins during the regular season, with at least five coming in conference play. 4. Bowling Green (2016 record: 4-8) \nAn otherwise horrendous debut for Mike Jinks was salvaged down the stretch, as the Falcons won three in a row to end the regular season after a 1-8 start. That turnaround, even if against some Mid-American Conference bottom-feeders — Akron, Kent State and Buffalo — makes Bowling Green a trendy contender in the East Division. 5. Cincinnati (2016 record: 4-8) \nFormer Ohio State assistant Luke Fickell takes on an enviable situation at Cincinnati, a program that foundered under Tommy Tuberville but has the talent to quickly reverse a two-year swoon. In this case, Fickell’s single season as the Buckeyes’ interim coach between Jim Tressel and Urban Meyer will provide a valuable blueprint for reaching a roster perhaps demoralized by the sputtering end to Tuberville’s four-year run. Persuading players to buy into his vision for the program will be Fickell’s most important order of business this spring. 6. Utah State (2016 record: 3-9) \nWas a 3-9 finish last fall an aberration — a single blip amid an otherwise fruitful period of success — or a sign of things to come? The answer to that question might hinge on how much faith one holds in Matt Wells, who oversaw three bowl trips in a row, including a 19-win stretch from 2013-14, before bottoming out a season ago. Wells’ track record, as well as the Aggies’ recent growth into an annual bowl contender, bodes well for a projected turnaround. 7. Marshall (2016 record: 3-9) \nAfter three seasons in a row with at least 10 wins, Marshall bottomed out with just three wins last fall. That tied the program’s low-water mark since 1983 while raising a question: Can Doc Holliday reverse the slide? Any improvement, if it comes, will be propelled by the projected growth of a defense that ranked among the worst in school history. The talent is there for the defense to improve, and in turn for the Thundering Herd to regain a foothold in Conference USA. 8. Nevada (2016 record: 5-7) \nFirst-year coach Jay Norvell inherits a good situation. Nevada isn’t broken; though the Wolf Pack did notch two losing finishes during Brian Polian’s four-year tenure, those seasons sandwiched back-to-back bowl berths. In other words, look for Nevada to make noise in a muddled Mountain West Conference West Division, where San Diego State remains the front-runner but as many as four or five teams have legitimate postseason aspirations. 9. UCF (2016 record: 6-7) \nUCF isn’t set for a huge leap in the American standings: Temple and South Florida are the leaders in the East Division, though the Knights are a clear third in the divisional pecking order, ahead of East Carolina and Cincinnati. Whether this team is set to challenge the Owls and Bulls depends on the development of Scott Frost’s offense, which sputtered at times in his debut season. At worst, however, the Knights seem set for seven wins and a return to the postseason. 10. Miami (Ohio) (2016 record: 6-7) \nThis is a bit of a layup, since the RedHawks did manage to squeeze into a bowl game — losing a heartbreaker in the St. Petersburg Bowl to Mississippi State — after an 0-6 start. But that’s why this is an easy one: Miami closed so strong that a failure to carry that momentum into the 2017 season would represent one of the bigger surprises in the MAC. There’s ample reason to believe the program has turned a corner under former Notre Dame assistant Chuck Martin. \nPROJECTING THE PRESEASON TOP 25 Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 1. Florida State: The Seminoles stumbled out of the gate this past season before hitting another gear following a loss to Clemson in October. With valuable experience under their belt and as much talent as any team in the country, Florida State is the team to beat in the Atlantic Coast Conference and very deserving of the title of preseason No. 1 in August. Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 2. Alabama: Personnel hits are coming, but that’s never derailed Alabama in the past. Quarterback Jalen Hurts will be even better, the offense should be more focused on the running game with a new coordinator and the defense will again rank among the nation’s best. Take note: Alabama and FSU meet in the opener. Brett Davis, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 3. Ohio State: Like the Crimson Tide, the Buckeyes will need to reload after losing several underclassmen to the NFL draft. But there will be far fewer losses this offseason than a year ago, so look for Ohio State to be loaded with talent and experience, not to mention more streamlined and less predictable on offense after some staffing changes. Rich Barnes, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 4. Michigan: The Wolverines will be right on the Buckeyes’ heels, as they were in 2016 — and as will be the case for as long as Jim Harbaugh and Urban Meyer are in charge. There is too much to like about Michigan to list here, but begin with the major assets: a wonderful defense despite a few losses in the back seven, a physical and punishing brand of offense, and a sense of unfinished business after two painful losses to end this year. Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 5. Washington: Reaching the Peach Bowl showed Washington’s growth, though the loss to Alabama revealed the distance still to travel before the Huskies can win a national championship. Considering Chris Petersen’s history, the 2017 team could be better than this year’s version, even if there will be a number of personnel issues to address as a result of early departures. The Huskies will be the preseason favorites in the Pac-12 and a strong contender for the Playoff. Jennifer Buchanan, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 6. Oklahoma: The Sooners obviously must improve on defense after a sluggish season, but there’s reason for optimism. Given the likely production of the Baker Mayfield-led offense, OU is simply a defense away from taking the Big 12 and returning to the Playoff. The Sooners have enormous expectations but slightly more question marks than the five teams listed above. Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 7. USC: Let the hype begin for USC and its superb quarterback Sam Darnold, who will begin his sophomore season at or near the top of every Heisman Trophy list. The question: Are the Trojans ready to take the next step? The ability and athleticism are there, but the potential departure of several NFL-ready underclassmen bears watching. Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 8. Penn State: The Nittany Lions’ biggest post-regular season development was offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead’s decision to return in 2017. That, along with the return of quarterback Trace McSorley and running back Saquon Barkley, will ensure this offseason will be even better next season. Recapturing this year’s magic won’t be easy, but there’s zero reason to think Penn State is poised to take any step back. Marc Lebryk, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 9. Clemson: Clemson is among the most intriguing teams in college football entering next season. Deshaun Watson won’t be around, and that alone is reason to think the Tigers will begin the year pegged to finish behind Florida State. But this program recruits an elite level, has an outstanding defensive line, should get improved play on the offensive line and has earned the benefit of the doubt. Still, there will be major weapons to replace on offense and key leaders to replace on defense. This may nonetheless be too low a ranking for Clemson. Joshua S. Kelly, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 10. Oklahoma State: To call Oklahoma State a sleeper ignores the fact that this program has been in the national picture for the better part of the decade. But there seems to be something overlooked about the Cowboys, who return the heart of their offense and have enough coming back on defense to be right alongside or just behind Oklahoma on the Big 12 ladder. Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports 11. LSU: The Tigers’ impressive bowl win against Louisville provided some early validation for Ed Orgeron. How far LSU goes hinges almost entirely on how quickly new coordinator Matt Canada can turn around the offense. Jonathan Dyer, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 12. Wisconsin: Any doubts of Wisconsin’s ability to remain a national presence should be dismissed after another banner year for Paul Chryst and the Badgers. UW will be just behind the top three of Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State in the Big Ten. Thomas J. Russo, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 13. Virginia Tech: In what was supposed to be a building year, Justin Fuente led the Hokies to a divisional title and 10 wins. The future will be even better, beginning with a 2017 team that should repeat atop the ACC Coastal Division. Jim Dedmon, Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 14. Auburn: This is the most intriguing team in the SEC and perhaps in all of college football. Auburn is often hit or miss, but the addition of Baylor transfer Jarrett Stidham should kick the Tigers’ offense into a different gear. But will that be enough? Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 15. Stanford: Replacing Christian McCaffrey and finding better quarterback play are the Cardinal’s most pressing questions entering the offseason. This might not be a perfect team, but trust in David Shaw and his staff to pilot Stanford to another season spent in the thick of the Pac-12 and Rose Bowl hunt. Ivan Pierre Aguirre, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 16. Boise State: The top-ranked team from the Group of Five ranks will again be a favorite for double-digit wins during the regular season. Look for quarterback Brett Rypien to take another step forward and become a top-10 player at his position nationally. Matt Kartozian, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 17. Georgia: The SEC East Division will be a toss-up, with Georgia and two other teams soon to appear on this battling for a shot at the conference title. The Bulldogs seem the most likely to take another step forward thanks to quarterback Jacob Eason’s development and the arrival of an outstanding recruiting class. Justin Ford, USA TODAY Sports 18. Tennessee: But the Volunteers aren’t far behind. Much depends on finding a capable successor to quarterback Josh Dobbs and locating the sort of consistency needed to go from top-25 team to Playoff contender. Christopher Hanewinckel, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 19. Louisville: There’s always reining Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, but Louisville’s late swoon raises the issue of whether this team is about more than just a sublime quarterback and offense. While still very much a threat in the ACC, the Cardinals should be placed behind FSU and Clemson in the Atlantic Division. Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 20. South Florida: Adding a defense-first coach in Charlie Strong to an impressive offense will keep USF in the mix for 10-plus wins and a New Year’s Six bowl in 2017. There are several strong contenders in the American Athletic Conference, but the Bulls are the preseason favorite. Shanna Lockwood, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 21. Utah: Pegging the Utes for a national ranking seems like a safe bet. Whether Utah can do more – such as knock off USC and win the South Division – remains a question, however, particularly with losses at running back, wide receiver and the defensive line. Kelley L Cox, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 22. Florida: It all comes down to the offense, and whether the Gators’ attack can finally find some momentum under Jim McElwain and produce at the rate needed to compete for a Playoff berth. That’s still a concern entering McElwain’s third season in charge. Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 23. West Virginia: There will be a new quarterback and a different look on defense, especially in the secondary. The Mountaineers are still a threat for a top-three finish in the Big 12 after what may very well be a breakthrough season for Dana Holgorsen. Logan Bowles, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 24. Texas: Does Texas have the same potential as Tom Herman’s first team at Houston, which went 13-1 and won the Peach Bowl? Maybe, but probably not. This team won’t win the Big 12, but a change in culture and a huge uptick in production on offense should find the Longhorns at eight or nine wins in 2017. Brendan Maloney, USA TODAY Sports 25. UCLA: It almost never pays to have faith in Jim Mora and UCLA, but years of strong recruiting and a healthy Josh Rosen under center should yield a nice rebound after a horrific 2016 season. Mark J.
