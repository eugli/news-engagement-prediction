They want the federal government to compel both states to obey the judgment of the Supreme Court of Nigeria on the boundary between Akwa Ibom and Cross River in suit No (SC/124/1999), while Akwa Ibom State should also honour the White Paper released by National Boundary Commission on March 11, 2002. \nThe communities entreated the government of Cross River and the Federal government to come to their aid by sending relief metatarsals to the affected communities to help ameliorate the hardship occasioned by the communal crises. \nResettlement: The people pleaded that Cross River state government should, as a matter of urgency, “facilitate the resettlement of Ikot Offiong people in the area already surveyed by Liyel Imoke during his administration, which is their ancestral home, including assisting the people of Mbiabo Edere to return to their former location at the East Bank of Cross River with heavy security presence in the area.” \nNDV learned the clash, which had claimed scores of lives since it started, 17 years ago, has become perennial and despite various efforts to resolve the cause of disagreement, the latest eruption was one of the bloodiest. As at the time of this report, many people from Ikot Offiong in Cross River have been rendered homeless, living as refugees in their community. Over 15,000 people were reportedly displaced because of the crisis in recent times and the impact was deeply felt, as there has been no aid from both states and federal government. \nBloodbath in the past 17 years \nThe member representing Odukpani constituency in the Cross River House of Assembly, Mr. Bassey Akiba, who spoke to NDV, called on the governments of Cross River and Akwa Ibom states to take immediate action to stop the bloody boundary clashes between the people of Oku-Iboku in Akwa Ibom and Odukpani in Cross River states. \nAddressing clan heads, chiefs and stakeholders from about thirty communities in Odukpani affected by the dispute, Akiba noted that hundreds of people and property worth billions of naira had been destroyed in the area since the clashes started 17 years ago. \nHe disclosed that critical stakeholders from the area had been meeting to find ways of resolving the problem. Akiba said one of the ways to resolve the matter was to ensure that the Ikot Offiong people, who have been displaced for about 17 years now were given a permanent settlement at the Cross River end of the Calabar-Itu Bridge.
