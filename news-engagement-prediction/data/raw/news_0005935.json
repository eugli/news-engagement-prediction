Bush and Bill Clinton even authorized Secret Service protection for their adult daughters for an unspecified period of time after the presidents left office. \n“The Secret Service does not have an option as to when it is, where it is, nor as to how much it costs, and whether it’s domestic or international,” said W. Ralph Basham, former director of the service. “Think about the consequences of something happening to one of the children. The security of it outweighs the expenses of it.” \nWhile Eric Trump was in Uruguay, the full presence of U.S. security operations did not go unnoticed by the local media and paparazzi. \nLa Nación, an Argentine publication, began its article about the visit with a scene-setter describing two Secret Service agents inside the Punta del Este showroom. Four more agents tried, unsuccessfully, to blend in with the crowd of real estate buyers outside, La Nación wrote. \nA local photographer encountered Eric Trump at La Huella, a restaurant described as the “ultimate in chic beach eating” and renowned for its grilled seafood entrees. \n“He had lunch there for about an hour and a half with some friends and acquaintances,” photographer Cristian Cordoba said in an email to The Post. “Secret Service was very close by monitoring. He was very kind and courteous with everyone that wanted to say hi to him. He even shook my hand after I took his picture. He said he loved the food and the place and would love to come back.” \nA well-known pop singer from Argentina, Maxi Trusso, performed at the Punta del Este party honoring Eric Trump. Trusso later told the local press that he wrote a song about Donald Trump at Eric’s request. Trusso titled the composition “Free and Stronger.” He also said that he was invited to sing at the inauguration but declined the offer. \nI’m not going to be involved in politics, and he’s not going to be involved in the business. \nThe Trumps, who do not own the Punta del Este project, licensed their name to its developers, who have paid Trump’s company between $100,000 and $1 million, according to Trump’s financial disclosure filing in May. \nThe 26-story tower is under construction. Its condos – which start at $550,000 and climb to $8 million – are expected to be finished in late 2018. Tower advertisements list amenities including waterfall pools, a massage room and a private theater. \nThe developer, YY Development Group, did not respond to requests for comment. But the chief executive, Juan Jose Cugliandolo, told the Associated Press last month that two-thirds of the condos were sold. Cugliandolo said of Eric Trump’s trip, “It honors us that he would come this summer, days before his father takes office,” the Associated Press reported. \nDuring an interview on the trip, Eric Trump fielded questions from the local media about political issues, including the president of Argentina and how his policies had affected the Trump property in Uruguay. \n“I don’t speak politics,” he said, according to a video of the interview. “It’s not my world. I’m a business guy.” \nBut the reporter pressed again, and Eric Trump said that he had a favorable opinion of Argentina’s president for “opening up the country,” which had helped business and helped the economy of Uruguay and Argentina. \nHe was also asked about his father and if he would ever join the administration. Eric Trump told La Nación that the relationship between the Trump Organization and his father’s administration would be completely separate, like “church and state.” It's great to visit @TrumpTowerPDE and see the construction progress! The building truly looks amazing! #PuntaDelEste pic.twitter.com/kp1g2lOApQ \n— Eric Trump (@EricTrump) January 5, 2017 \nBut ethical experts say that the steps Donald Trump announced to facilitate such a separation, including placing his business into a trust overseen by Eric, Donald Trump Jr. and a longtime company executive, are not enough to eliminate concerns about conflicts of interest. \n“Having refused to sever his own personal financial interests, [the president] is now sending his emissaries, his sons, out to line his own pockets, and he’s subsidizing that activity with taxpayer dollars,” said Norm Eisen, a former President Barack Obama administration ethics adviser who is part of a lawsuit accusing Trump of violating a constitutional provision barring presidents from taking payments from foreign governments. \nIt is unusual, although not unprecedented, for trips of presidential family members to focus on the development of private moneymaking opportunities. \nIn 1989, Jeb Bush drew criticism after he traveled to Nigeria on a business trip less than two months after his father, George H.W. Bush, was sworn in as president. \n“The president’s children should not be deprived of career opportunities just because they are members of the first family,” the White House press secretary said in 1989. \nJeb Bush, through his spokeswoman, declined an interview request. \nDuring his interview with the media in Uruguay, Eric was asked about how his life would change under his father’s administration. \n“We’re going to have an amazing company, and he’s going to do amazing things for the United States,” he said to the local media. “He’s going to be an incredible commander in chief. And I’m not going to be involved in politics, and he’s not going to be involved in the business.” \nHe also said that once his father moved to Washington, he would be headed back to New York to run the company with his brother. But there are early signs that Eric and Don Jr. will be spending plenty of time in Washington. \nSeveral days ago, the brothers sat side-by-side in the front row during Trump’s White House announcement of Neil Gorsuch as his nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court. Afterward, Don Jr. posted on social media that he had enjoyed chatting with Gorsuch about their shared love for fly-fishing. \nLater this month, Eric and Don Jr. are expected to travel to Vancouver in celebration of the grand opening of the new Trump International Hotel & Tower. \nThe trip is expected to bring the Trump brothers together with wealthy Malaysian developer Tony Tiah Thee Kian and his son, Joo Kim Tiah, head of the Vancouver project. \nRichard Painter, a former chief White House ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush who joined Eisen in the lawsuit, called the family’s Secret Service protection a “worthwhile expenditure of taxpayer money.” But Painter said he worried that it could be misread as boosting the Trump brand. \n“All of this has an air of legitimacy: The connection to the U.S. government, and the suggestion that if you do business with this company you’ll ingratiate yourself with the Trump administration,” Painter said. The implication is “if you do a good deal with us, you’ll be in good with the United States. And the Secret Service presence just exacerbates that.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T11:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:56:55.012+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
