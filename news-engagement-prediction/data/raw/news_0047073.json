(AAP) Queensland MP Bob Katter is hoping more Coalition MPs will join Nationals MP George Christensen and break ranks with the LNP to trigger a public inquiry into Australia’s banking sector. By Tweet \nMr Katter is calling on voters in favor of a Royal Commission to deliver a “blunt” warning to their local Coalition MPs and pressure them to join Mr Christensen, who earlier this month promised to cross the floor and vote in favor of a bill. \n“There is no use being nice to politicians, they don’t understand that,” Katter told SBS News. \n“Just tell them either you do it or we will work against you at the next election.\" \nThe Turnbull government opposes a Royal Commission into the banks, while Labor and the Greens both support a public inquiry. \nOther members of the lower house, including Rebekha Sharkie of the Nick Xenophon team and independents Andrew Wilkie and Cathy McGowan, have all previously expressed support for a public inquiry. George Christensen set to cross the floor over banking royal commission SBS World News Radio: A public investigation into the banking industry could be a step closer, with government backbench MP George Christensen pledging to cross the floor and vote for a bill to trigger a Comimssion of Inquiry into the sector. \nSBS News understands if Mr Christensen crossed the floor, this would bring the numbers in the House of Representatives to 75 for the bill and 74 against, assuming everyone was present for the vote. \nLast year the heads of ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, Wespac and NAB were hauled before a parliamentary hearing to answer questions over a series of recent scandals, including the CommInsure life insurance scandal. \nPolling done in October by independent think tank The Australia Institute found 68 per cent of respondents supported a Royal Commission. \nThis morning Queensland MP Warren Entsch said he supported a tribunal to support victims of the banking sector, but ruled out supporting a Royal Commission. \n“It's quite evident that we all know what the problems are and it's about trying to find solutions,” Entsch told the ABC.
