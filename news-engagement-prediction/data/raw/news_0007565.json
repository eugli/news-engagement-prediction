I had come to this rundown apartment complex with members of my church to clean apartments for recently arrived refugees. I didn’t have the courage to knock on an unknown door, so I gathered garbage from beneath the old swing set in a trash-strewn courtyard. \nA woman appeared from between two buildings, her face all but concealed behind a black veil. She walked over to me and took my arm. “Come,” she said. \nSilently she led me to an apartment on the far side of the courtyard. Flowers and vegetables defied the season in a postage-sized plot beside the front door, curtained off from the dirty surroundings with bright fabric. “You are welcome,” she said in halting English, and gestured into her home. \nThe small apartment was neat, rugs on the floor and Islamic art on the walls. The woman signaled for me to sit. “I am Seham,” she said. “From Syria.” Around the corner, a child peeked at me with huge brown eyes, and the voices of other children floated in. From the kitchen, the woman brought an ornate silver tray bearing tiny cups of coffee. She set it in front of me, nodding and smiling. The face veil was gone. A colorful hijab covered her hair, framing her expressive eyes. \nFor a Mormon such as me, the coffee was a dilemma. The language barrier prevented explanation of my faith. I thought of her courage to invite a stranger into her home, of her eagerness for connection, of her hospitality. She, the hospitable one! She, the stranger in a strange land! \nReader, I sipped. Seham’s story \nOver the next hour and through the course of many visits in the following weeks and months, I pieced together Seham Al-Ahmad’s life, communicated through sign language, limited English and translation apps. \nSeham was born in Homs, a major city in western Syria, an industrial and educational center and a place of religious diversity. Reared in a traditional Muslim family, she left school and married at age 14, though her brothers pursued education, one of them becoming a university professor in Homs. Her young husband, Abdulrazak, also left school early, and worked in construction as their family grew. One after another, the sons arrived: Mohammed, Musa, Ismaeel, Yones and Adam. \nThis last son, Adam, the child with the huge brown eyes, was born as the civil war in Syria began. Homs became a flashpoint in the conflict, and conditions worsened through 2012 and 2013, the period known as the Siege of Homs. \nIn 2013, with Adam just a 1-year-old babe in arms, Seham and Abdulrazak made the difficult decision to flee to Jordan, a crowded three-hour bus ride away. Seham’s parents and siblings stayed behind. Abdulrazak’s family fled with them. Seham has not seen her parents and siblings in person since, though they stay in contact through messaging apps and mobile communication. Her mother cries when she sees how Adam has grown. \nIn Jordan, Seham and her husband’s family settled in the capital city, Amman, where Abdulrazak worked construction jobs. They were the lucky ones, with resources to avoid the crowded refugee camps. \nSeham and Abdulrazak knew virtually no English, but they thought of America as a beautiful and safe place. So warm were their feelings for this American dreamland, so strong their desire to protect their sons, that they were willing to put an ocean between themselves and their families. They wanted to go to the United States. \nThey began the process of applying for refugee status. First came registration and screening with the U.N., scrutiny of their documents and multiple interviews. This step passed, they were among the fortunate few referred to the United States. Next came vetting by the State Department, with another series of long interviews and checks. Every step stretched out for months. Months turned into years. \nFinally, in 2016, Seham and Abdulrazak received word that their application was cleared. They were given travel documents for St. Louis. They would travel with their five sons, but Abdulrazak’s parents and brother would stay in Jordan, where they remain. \nThey arrived in St. Louis in August 2016, part of a surge that brought more than 2,500 Syrian refugees to the United States that month. The International Institute, the only agency authorized for refugee resettlement in St. Louis, set them up in a modest apartment, connected them with basic social services and oriented them to the area. \nThe boys enrolled at Nahed Chapman New American Academy, a school for immigrant and refugee children in the city. They bought a used car, and Abdulrazak looked for work. Seham attended an English class in the mornings. They found a mosque, and a few friends among other Syrian refugees in their apartment complex. \nThey were safe and settled, but life was challenging. Their English is rudimentary, which greatly limits Abdulrazak’s employment opportunities. He finds only occasional part-time work. Their car was broken into, costing them $1,000 in repairs. They had difficulty navigating the health care system. They felt unsafe letting their children play outdoors in the rough neighborhood, so Seham and the children were largely confined to the house. \nLandlords turned down their applications for apartment after apartment. They have yet to visit the zoo or the Gateway Arch. Their connection to the larger community is largely abstract. They feel tremendous gratitude for St. Louis and its people, but they have few relationships within mainstream culture. Baklava and vanilla blossoms \nPerhaps that is why Seham approached me out of the blue with such courage last October. Whatever the reason, I count it a great privilege to have been drawn into her warm orbit. \nMy fellow Mormons may have been scandalized to see me sip Seham’s coffee — I have since communicated to her that I do not prefer coffee, and she now serves me soda — but they would have recognized the social situation in which I found myself. \nMormons visit each other, a well-organized responsibility that is a formalized pillar of our religious practice. Through assignments, we visit each other at least once a month, share conversation, inquire about one another’s needs and lives, and render any help and assistance we can. \nSo I knew how to get involved in Seham’s life, once she opened the door. \nIt brings me tremendous pleasure to help her in the small ways that I am able. I bring her gifts of household items; I have helped her find dental care and a washing machine ; I try to help her understand the bureaucratic processes of school and health care. I hired her to bake Syrian delicacies for a party. At Christmas, I brought my husband and children to meet Seham’s whole family, and we watched her children unwrap with glowing faces the presents we’d brought. \nMostly, though, I just sit with her and talk as best I can. Many times she looks at me with uncomprehending eyes, despite our best efforts with the translation app, and we just laugh and shake our heads. She is so quick to laugh. \nAnd I eat. Seham is a gifted baker. She brought with her from Syria her treasured cookie molds, with which she produces exquisite date- and nut-filled cookies. Baklava. Knaffa. Chocolate-coconut balls. Cream cakes. Delicate chocolate and vanilla blossoms. Delicacy after delicacy comes from her kitchen. She’s taught me to say “Saha,” which I gather means, “Thank you, this is delicious.” A community of friends \nNever say never, but I’m unlikely to ever join a protest. Shouting slogans in a politically motivated crowd is about the last form of communication I’d ever choose. \nMy friendship with Seham is far more meaningful to me than a poster board sign or a social media statement could ever be. Indeed, our friendship is sacred to me, and I share it here, with an obvious, if unstated, political meaning, with great hesitation (and with the family’s explicit consent). I fear that I am exploiting the relationship for self-congratulation and political point-scoring. \nNo doubt I am. But I am also, I hope, expanding our shared understanding of the refugee question that roils Western society in this moment. \nCan I guarantee that Seham’s husband and sons will integrate seamlessly into American society, will never become alienated and turn to radical ideas? \nOf course not. \nBut I can guarantee that I will show them an American face that welcomes them, welcomes their faith, invites them into civil society and integrates them into a community of friends. \nMore than anything, I want to convey the openness and hope of Seham and her family. Some refugees, it is true, arrive deeply traumatized by their experiences, unable to engage their new communities. Not Seham. Not Abdulrazak. Not Mohammed, Musa, Ismaeel, Yones or little Adam. \nThey want to know you, they want to know their new nation and community, they want to benefit from and contribute to the immeasurable blessings we enjoy. They are ready to learn, to work. They can be the success story. \nThis week I visited Seham. The family just moved to a rented single-family home in Florissant. They are ecstatic with the quiet street and the backyard. Abdulrazak and the older sons were at work making repairs on the windows and garage. \nI pray fervently that their neighbors will be kind, that the schools will be safe and nurturing. That Abdulrazak will find work, that Seham will find another English class. \nI toured the house, hugged the children, and ate cookies, of course. I squeezed Seham’s hand and said again and again, “New house is good! So beautiful!” \nWhen I got home she texted me, “Thank you for the visit wonderful sister.” \nWelch is an active Mormon and a writer and independent scholar of contemporary Mormonism.
