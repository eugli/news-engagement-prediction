The project could cost up to $120 million, requiring funding from all three levels of government.

(Scott Dippel/CBC)\n\"Our primary interest would be to raise money through the three levels of government, through corporate support, [and] through stakeholders,\" he said.\nThe first phase is expected to cost roughly $40 million to $50 million; the second, between $60 million and $70 million. A zoning change will have to be approved by the city as well.\nBooke says if they can raise the money, the first construction phase could start in late 2018.\nMORE CALGARY NEWS | New option for Green Line LRT alignment upsets Ramsay Community Association MORE CALGARY NEWS | WestJet to pay for damages after ice chunk crashes through Calgary house With files from Scott Dippel", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T23:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:59:15.115+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
