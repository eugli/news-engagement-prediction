This country would have to go through disappointment post-Brexit on a huge, huge scale.

President-elect Donald Trump and his transition team are in the process of filling cabinet and other high level positions for the new administration. ITV The former Ukip leader said 2016 showed \"old certainties are out the window\" \nHe left viewers on a cliff-edge on whether he would be there to pick up the pieces and repeated: “Anything can happen. If this falls to bits, anything could happen, let’s see.” \nThe politician then had a dig at the “liberal media” after TV host joked about Mr Farage and Donald Trump being in power at the same time. \n“So we could end up with the White House with Donald Trump, Number 10 Downing Street with Nigel Farage - where’s my gig in all of this?” asked Morgan. \nMr Farage replied: “Well once you’ve apologised on behalf of the liberal media for the way you’ve treated me, the world is your oyster, Piers.” \nEarlier in the show, Mr Farage blasted Eurocrats controlling “virtually every aspect of our commercial lives”. \nHe said: “To me it was fundamental should we actually have the basic facets of a nation, a nation controls its borders, makes its laws, and puts its own people first, that's what a nation does and that I felt is what we’d surrendered. \n“And a bunch of gutless politicians, without ever telling us the truth, were happy to give that away and I thought to hell with them, I’m going to do something about it and I did.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:24:57.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
