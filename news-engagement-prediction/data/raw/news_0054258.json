Right now, American women live to an average of 81, while men live to an average of 77.\nBut other developed countries are projected to do even better by 2030, according to the study in The Lancet . \nIn fact, after running 21 different statistical models across 35 different developed nations, investigators found that South Korea is projected to fare the best in terms of future life span.\nFor example, South Korean women, as of 2010, are expected to live on average to roughly 84 years of age. But there's a strong possibility that figure will reach more than 90 by 2030, the study authors said.\n\"As recently as the turn of the century, many researchers believed that life expectancy would never surpass 90 years,\" study lead author Majid Ezzati noted in a journal news release. Ezzati is a professor at Imperial College London's School of Public Health in England. \n\"Our predictions of increasing life spans,\" he added, \"highlight our public health and health care successes. However, it is important that policies to support the growing older population are in place.\n\"In particular, we will need to both strengthen our health and social care systems and to establish alternative models of care such as technology-assisted home care,\" Ezzati said.\nThe research team said that the projections are estimates that, while highly probable, aren't necessarily how things will turn out.\nThat said, the investigators combined the results of various statistical models to come up with more accurate tallies than what they said would normally be generated by a single model alone.\nThey found that among women, France came in second to South Korea, with French women expected to live to 88.6 years by 2030. Japanese women were only slightly behind, with 88.4 years by 2030.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:16:58.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
