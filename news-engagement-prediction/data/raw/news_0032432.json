We will put an end to this if elected to power. Criminal cases will be registered against the land mafia and the guilty will be hung upside down,” Shah said addressing a political rally at Faridpur in Bareilly on Monday. \nThis was Shah’s first rally in the district. He addressed a similar rally in Pilibhit on Saturday. \n“The SP is controlled by a family, which has destroyed the state and now they have joined hands with another family, which destroyed the country,” said Shah, in a veiled dig at the Congress. \nIn his 40-minute speech, Shah targeted the SP-Congress alliance but remained quiet on the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).

The BJP is the only party that talks about every community in the society… sabka saath, sabka vikas,” said Yogi. \nBoth leaders also tried to woo farmers, and mentioned pro-farmer schemes of the BJP government at the Centre. \nIn 2012, the BJP won three of the nine assembly seats in the district. The party won both the Lok Sabha seats in 2014 and is looking to improve its record in the upcoming elections. \nBareilly is one of the most important districts in the second phase of the seven-phase assembly election. Polling is scheduled to take place on February 15. Read more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:05.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
