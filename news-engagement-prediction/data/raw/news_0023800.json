Alamy 3 A ten-year-old boy pleads with a judge not to send him and his siblings back to their abusive mother \nThe court had earlier heard how the children’s mum had hurled a Christmas tree across a room in 2015, thrown her children out of the house and yelled: “I’ve got my vodka, f*** the kids, I don’t care.” \nExperts said she had also branded them “f***ing c****”. \nAfter hearing the boy’s desperate plea, Judge Barbara Cameron agreed the three children should not be handed back to their mother. 3 The boy told Medway Family Court how he felt about being sent home \nThe boy, known only as “B”, told Medway Family Court in Chatham, Kent, last month: “Dear Judge, I am writing to say how I feel about being taken home. \n“I feel that we should not go back to my mum’s house because she promised that she would stop drinking, arguing and fighting, but she didn’t. \n“My mum is also incapable of keeping us because she drinks all day, every day. \n“Since being in care we are happy and safe and we don’t have to worry about each other. \n“Please don’t send us home. \n“Sincerely, from B.” Mum films herself on Facebook Live beating her daughter with plywood Related stories Birmingham hotel bans asylum seekers ahead of multi-million pound refurb after guests complain SCI FI STAR DIES Battlestar Galactica star Richard Hatch dies aged 71 after pancreatic cancer battle 'IT'S GOING NUTS!'

Alamy The boy gave evidence in a criminal trial involving his mother in Maidstone Crown Court last October \nShe ruled the mum had shaken her baby daughter and lied “repeatedly” in evidence. \nBy contrast, the judge said B was an “obviously intelligent, articulate and delightful young boy”. \nAnd she found his experience was “devastating” because he knew his mum had acted wrongly with his baby sister. \nThe boy and his siblings will remain together with their new foster family. \nThe dad had wanted the baby girl to move with him, but the judge said it would be wrong to separate them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:55:40.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
