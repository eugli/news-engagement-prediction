It will watch the future attitude of the Malaysian side,\" the statement said. \nThe deceased believed to be Kim Jong Nam died on the way to the hospital from Kuala Lumpur's main airport last week, in what South Korean and US officials say was an assassination carried out by North Korean agents. \nCCTV footage from the airport has emerged of what appears to be two females approaching the North Korean while one swipes his face. \nMalaysian police said they have not received any offer of assistance from the North Korean embassy and are awaiting medical and dental records to identify the deceased after a postmortem was conducted. There has been no confirmation on the cause of death. \nThe Inspector General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar said more time will be given for family members of the deceased to come forward to provide DNA samples for identification. - CNA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:37:48.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
