The Oilers and Bruins, if not the Maple Leafs, also are believed to have interest in Shattenkirk. \nIt is unknown whether general manager Jeff Gorton would be willing to yield his club’s first-rounder as part of a package to get the defenseman who presumably would become Ryan McDonagh’s first-pair partner as well as the power play’s point man, but the Blueshirts remain steadfast in their unwillingness to deal away a young top-nine forward. Pavel Buchnevich would fit under that umbrella. Brady Skjei is off limits. And the Rangers at this point are believed to have no interest in including defenseman Sean Day, the 2016 third-rounder, who has had a very good season for OHL Windsor, as part of a deal to bring back Shattenkirk. \nThe Rangers, who have a limited number of available assets with which to work as Wednesday’s 3 p.m. deadline approaches, also are investigating the cost of adding a forward to the roster, but it is unlikely they would be able to acquire both a defenseman of consequence (i.e., Shattenkirk) and a top-nine forward without disassembling their 40-20-2 club. \nThings can always change, but that has never been part of Gorton’s plan.
