To start this season, the tables were turned. \nHall of Famer Greg Maddux — who looks much like musician Dave Grohl when in a wig and hat — was the “sound guy” for Bryant’s batting practice. When the coach had to leave, the sound guy took over pitching, and Bryant struggled, saying, “This sound guy’s got a good curve ball!” \nThe amazing thing here? Maddux will turn 51 in April. He pitched for 23 years in the Major Leagues. He still has an arm that gives trouble to the reigning National League MVP. More MLB!
