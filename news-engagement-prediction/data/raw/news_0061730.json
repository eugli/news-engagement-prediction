It comes alongside a sugar tax on drinks, to encourage manufacturers to reduce sugar levels, and to persuade consumers to choose healthier options. \nPublic health experts last night urged the food industry to act quickly to reduce the sugar content from common foods. A child could eat five slices of Victoria sponge a day, and consume the same sugar as is found in foods that seem far more healthy \nG overnment advice recommends that sugar should account for no more than 5 per cent of daily calories. \nBut the research shows the average 11 to 18 year old is consuming 73.2 g of sugar a day - more than twice the recommended 30g daily. \nThe alliance said children were regularly consuming high amounts of hidden sugars from soup, ready meals, and breakast cereals, without their parents realising how unhealthy such foods were. \nDr Modi Mwatsama, from the Obesity Health Alliance said: “Most parents would never hand over 20 chocolate biscuits a day to their children, but with so much hidden sugar in our food and drink it can often be hard to know just how much children are consuming.” \n“That is why we are calling the food and drink industry to urgently comply with the Government’s reformulation programme.” \nT he alliance includes the Royal College of Physicians, Cancer Research UK, the National Obesity Forum and Diabetes UK. \nThe charities said the presence of hidden sugars was contributing to record levels of childhood obesity, with one in three obese or overweight by the time they leave primary school. \nGovernment recommendations say that adults and children aged 11 and more should have no more than 30g sugar daily. \nParents were often shocked to find that savoury foods - such as tomato soup, baked beans, and ready meals - contained high levels of sugar, along with the breakfast cereals that their children consumed daily. \nOne can of Sainsbury’s Cream of Tomato Soup contains almost 24g of sugar, with more than 20g sugar in one can of Heinz Baked Beans, their research found, while many ready meals contained almost 40g of sugar each. Savoury foods often have higher sugar content than consumers realise Credit: PA \nS arah Toule, head of health information at World Cancer Research Fund, said: “It can often be hard to know exactly how much sugar children are having as it is hidden in so much of their food and drink. \n“Overweight or obese children are more likely to be so as adults putting them at risk of 11 common cancers. In fact, after not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight is the best thing people can do to reduce their risk of cancer. \n“The food and drink industry can play a vital role in helping tackle obesity rates by reducing the sugar content in their products and making the healthy choice the easy choice”. \nThe figures, calculated from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey show that on average all age groups are consuming more free sugars than the Government’s recommendations, which amount to seven sugar cubes a day - or 30grams of free sugars. \nThe highest intake is in 11 to 18 year olds (73.2g/day), followed by 19 to 64 year olds (59.9g/day) and then 4 to 10 year olds (53.5g/day). Free sugars are any sugars added to food or drinks, or found naturally in honey, syrups and unsweetened fruit juices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:06:32.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
