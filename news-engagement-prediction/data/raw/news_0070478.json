Starring Rajkummar Rao, the film was shot in just one month. bollywood Updated: Feb 22, 2017 20:06 IST Hindustan Times, New Delhi Rajkummar Rao’s Trapped is a survivor’s tale. \nVikramaditya Motwane, the director of Udaan and Lootera, is back with his new film Trapped starring Rajkummar Rao. \nShot in less than a month, the film tells the story of a guy who accidentally gets locked inside a Mumbai apartment. There onwards, it changes into a survival tale where Rao needs to deal with the lack of electric supply and water shortage. \nThe intriguing trailer shows him shouting to the watchman several floors beneath him, but nobody comes to his help. The string of his life is now hanging by a rope called hope. \nRao, a National Award winning actor, spoke at the film’s trailer launch, “I think that line between indie cinema and commercial is thinning. There isn’t not much a difference between them. If you put four songs and one item number, it will become a commercial film. I really don’t differentiate between a commercial or an indie film. For me it’s the story which matters and the filmmakers.” Read more Jolly LLB 2: Court seeks Akshay Kumar’s contact details in Bata defamation case \nThe actor prepared for the role by surviving on “coffee and carrots” for nearly 20 days to portray the physical transformation convincingly. “It was physically and mentally exhausting for me to live in that space for almost 18-20 days, to eat nothing. Trust me, it’s scary to hell. If you don’t eat for two days you feel so frustrated, angry on everything.” \nTrapped is scheduled to hit the screens on March 17, 2017. \n(With inputs from PTI) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T03:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:15:26.238+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
