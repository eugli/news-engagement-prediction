(Photo: PTI) Unnao: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday jumped into the bandwagon of giving yet another full form to SCAM and said that for him it means 'save the country from Amit Shah and Modi sahab'.\n\"As Prime Minister said earlier, that UP needs to be protected from SCAM, then I also gave my version of SCAM that is 'save the country from A as Amit Shah and M stands for Modi ji,' he said addressing a rally in Unnao.\nAkhilesh left no stone unturned to indirectly attack his political rival, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), as he addressed the latter as elephant.\n\"There is a pattarwali government, just imagine if there is an elephant in your area and forces himself into your house then everything will be demolished. I know people who left the BSP tell us that nothing happens without money in the party. So that is why be cautious about them.\nWe know that in their tenure, they constructed many elephants (statue) and nobody can lift them,\" he added.\nAddressing a rally earlier, Prime Minister Modi said that Uttar Pradesh will not show any progress unless it is free from corruption, which can be achieved only if the 'SCAM' is removed from power, adding that UP has the potential to be India's most prosperous state.\nPrime Minister Modi, during his Meerut rally also alleged that the Akhilesh Yadav government had done little to help the poor, marginalised or the farmers in the state.\nIn a jibe at the Samajwadi Party's internal bickering during the past few months, The Prime Minister further stated, \"Jo papa, chacha, mama mein hi phasa reh gaya wo pradesh pe kya dhyan dega.\" (How will a person who remained busy minding his father and uncles find time to work for the state?)\nWith the first phase of Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections less than a week away, all political parties are on their toes to gauge as many voters as possible.\nThe state will be voting for a new government in a seven-phase election between February 11 and March 8. Out of the 403 assembly seats, the Congress will be contesting in 105 seats and the Samajwadi Party will field its candidates in rest of the 298 seats.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T00:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T19:13:54.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
