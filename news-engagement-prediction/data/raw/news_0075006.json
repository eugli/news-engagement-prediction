I wouldn’t allow Keely to wear tight trousers.\n\"It’s school, not a fashion parade.\"\nThe school’s website shows a diagram of the required uniform of a plain black skirt of a reasonable length, just above or just below the knee or black, straight-legged, loose-fitting trousers.\nTight trousers or leggings/jeggings are not allowed and are covered with big red crosses.\nAngry mother Jodie Patience also hit out at the school. Her daughter is 13 and has been wearing the same style of trousers from the M&S school range for the last three years and, claimed her upset mum, had been assured by the head of year that these were suitable.\nShe said: “My daughter said the deputy head picked all the girls as they came into school and sent them into a classroom for wrong uniform.\n“Then they phoned all the parents to tell them to pick them up and take them home.\n“My daughter’s trousers are not leggings or skinny trousers and they’re not cheap - I bought her three pairs at £16 each.”\nJodie claims pupils at the soon-to-be academy were told that ‘boys were being put off studying’ because some of the girls were wearing the incorrect uniform.\nParents were sent a text message before the start of the February half-term warning there would be a uniform check this week.\nJodie who lives on Windward Way said: “They didn’t want to be sent home.\n“I’ve now gone out and bought her another pair of the same M&S trousers but in a bigger size so they will be looser.\n“But there’s nothing wrong with the ones she has”.\nThe College is in the process of becoming an academy and joining Fairfax Multi-Academy Trust.\nThe Mail made repeated attempts to get a comment from Smith’s Wood Sports College, but as we went to press the school had not replied.\n Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily Education Schools", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=DailyMirror", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/dozens-girls-sent-home-school-12665136"], "published": "2017-02-28T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:54:28.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
