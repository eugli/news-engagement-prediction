Advertisement \nThis afternoon to my surprise, our building \"nator\" handed a parcel which was the item I saw in Facebook but I never ordered. \nI was so shocked on how come they sent the item without my confirmation or full payment for instance so for me to expect for the item and pay. \nTo my worry it is stated in the invoice sent together with the product that if I don't pay for the said product, they will set reminders if I will not pay. \nHow come is this happening while they just ask was to sign up for free information as that about their product but not to used for blackmail as sending items not ordered and they will expect payment instantly as that?! \nJubilo A.S.S.
