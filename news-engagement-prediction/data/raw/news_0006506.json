Its share price plunged to its lowest level in more than 20 years because of fears over whether the bank had the funds to cover its mounting legal costs. \nThe lender had managed to generate small profits for the first three quarters of 2016, but the heavy charges it booked in the last three months dragged it down to a full-year loss of €1.4 billion ($1.5 billion). \nThat's still less ugly than the €6.8 billion ($7.3 billion) loss it suffered in 2015. \nCEO John Cryan said last year's results were \"heavily impacted by decisive management action taken to improve and modernize the bank, as well as by market turbulence.\" \nShares in the bank dropped by nearly 3% in early trade. \nThe bank's revenues fell 10% last year to €30 billion ($32.4 billion), which it blamed on several issues including \"a challenging market environment\" and pressures on its businesses.
