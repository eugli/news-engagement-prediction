Middle European royalty or something?\" \nConfirming Mr Nardella had also claimed the allowance, a government spokesperson said the matter had been referred to the Audit Committee of Parliament and that the Premier urged the committee to provide recommendations on the use of the entitlement \"as soon as possible.\" \nOn Friday Premier Daniel Andrews defended Mr Languiller, saying he had not made any excuses and would repay the money. \nMr Andrews said it was \"self-evident\" the entitlement was designed to cover expenses for country MPs, not city MPs living in regional areas. \nMr Smith said the allowance claimed by Mr Nardella should be repaid. \n\"No-one forced Don Nardella to move to Ocean Grove and frankly, he represents Melton,\" he said. \n\"We, in the Liberal Party, sign a statutory declaration saying that we'll live in our electorate. \n\"The Labor Party should do the same. This idea that people live miles from their electorate shows the contempt they hold for the people they're trying to represent.\" \nMr Andrews repeatedly spoke out about the misuse of entitlements as Opposition leader in 2014, at the height of a political crisis triggered by former balance-of-power Independent MP Geoff Shaw. \nIn June 2014, Mr Andrews sought to have the former Frankston MP expelled for misusing his parliamentary car and fuel card. \nBut the Premier insisted there was a \"very, very big difference\" between Mr Shaw's case and Mr Languiller's claim.
