Article continues below \nFIFA 17 features 650 teams and 30 different leagues, which is a far cry from the options Pro Evolution Soccer offers its gamers. Unless, you like playing with Merseyside Blue and East Dorsetshire, of course. \nWith all the recent big money moves to China, it would make sense if EA incorporated the Chinese Super League into the 2018 incarnation of FIFA. Article continues below \nImagine the money at your disposal if you were to start a career with one of those clubs? \nWell, according to now Jiangsu Suning forward Teixeira, his side are set to feature in FIFA 18. \nThe caption under the picture translates to: “Official presentation for FIFA 18, New shirt for the 2017 season.” \nA laughing emoji does accompany the post at the end, so one would be wise to take the post with a pinch of salt rather than an official announcement. \nBut, having said that, it would make the world of sense if they did bring the league into the game. After all, there would be plenty of superstars who would then be unplayable if they didn't, including Hulk, Axel Witsel, Alexandre Pato, Ramires, Oscar, Graziano Pelle, Odion Ighalo, Jackson Martinez, Gervinho, Fredy Guarin and Demba Ba. \nHowever, users on the Reddit page of FIFA have weighed in on the potential inclusion of the league and made several pertinent points. \n“Gonna be so weird. It will be like loads of 55-64 rated players with random 82s and 83s mixed in,\" one user stated. \n“There's no way their top players are gonna be 82-83 rated, they will have their ratings deducted for not being in a 'top league',\" another replied. \nWhat do you guys think, should EA go ahead and include the Chinese Super League?
