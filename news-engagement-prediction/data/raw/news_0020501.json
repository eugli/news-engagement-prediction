Key points: Two Republicans joined 46 Democrats, two independents in opposition to Ms DeVos Mr Trump tweeted his congratulations to the nominee and Mr Pence praised her Democrats are concerned she will promote charter schools, which operate independently of school districts \nThe tie-breaking vote, which Senate officials said was unprecedented to confirm a Cabinet nominee, followed an all-night debate on Ms DeVos as Senate Democrats tried to pressure at least one more Republican to oppose her and defeat the nomination. \nOnly two Republicans joined the 46 Democrats and two independents in opposition to Ms DeVos. \nCritics have called her unprepared to lead the Department of Education after a rocky Senate confirmation hearing. \nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer immediately derided the proceeding. \n\"This cabinet nom is so unqualified, so divisive, that @MikePenceVP had to drive down Pennsylvania Ave to cast the deciding vote,\" he wrote in a Twitter post after the vote. \nUnder the US Constitution, the Vice-President also serves as president of the Senate, with the power to cast votes only when there are ties on nominations or legislation. \nMr Trump tweeted his congratulations to the nominee and Mr Pence praised her. \nUltimately, only Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined the Democrats and two independents in opposition to Ms DeVos. \nThat left 50 Republicans supporting her in the 100-member chamber. \nHistorically, Cabinet nominees with weak support in the Senate ask the President to withdraw their nomination, which Ms DeVos did not do. Who is Betsy DeVos? \nMs DeVos is married to the heir and former chief executive of Amway, which sells household and personal care items. \nShe is also the daughter of the founders of Prince Corp, a Michigan car parts supplier, and sister of Erik Prince, the founder of the security company formerly known as Blackwater USA, now called Academi. \nAs the debate wound down, Mr Schumer said of Ms DeVos: \"She disdains public education where 90 per cent of our students are\". \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, urging her confirmation, said it was time to \"end the unprecedented delay by Democrats\" on the Cabinet nominations by Mr Trump, who took office on January 20. \nMs DeVos has been an advocate of charter schools, which operate independently of school districts and frequently are run by corporations. \nDemocrats are concerned she will promote charter schools in a way that would undercut public schools, which have long been the anchor of the US education system. \nTeachers unions, a major constituency for the Democratic Party, roundly opposed Ms DeVos to lead the department, which sets education policy for younger children and universities and also administers a college financial aid program of $1 trillion. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:23:17.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
