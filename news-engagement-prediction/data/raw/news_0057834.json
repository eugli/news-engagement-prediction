However, the model-turned-nun defended herself saying that she was the equal of Buddha. \"If you check my Instagram, many young Indians are offended because I have swastika on my feet. Buddha had it on his feet. It is a symbol in all religions. I am the equal of Buddha, all things came from me. I am the Goddess Sofia. There are books written about my return. I am here for humanity. The swastika is so scared to me. It is under my blessed feet. My whole body is sacred, like my heart, my breath. My feet carry me all on this earth and under my feet lies the universe,\" she told ABP. Well, we wonder what Sofia is upto next.
