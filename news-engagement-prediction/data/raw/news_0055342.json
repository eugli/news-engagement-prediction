Picture: John Appleyard\nWhen she brought Archie home from near Windsor in November, Mrs Holt said he was very “down in the dumps” as he had formed a close attachment to his handler.\n“At home he did not quite know what to do,” she said. “I had him in another bedroom, he slept on the spare bed.\n“He did not know this sort of life. I had to teach him how to walk up the stairs and interact with toys. Now he is such a changed dog, he is so happy.”\nSince being adopted, Archie passed a six-week greyhound retraining program Greenhound where he was taught how to behave like a domestic dog including coping with the noise of a vacuum cleaner and walking on a lead.\nNow he is allowed to go for walkies with an approved collar instead of a muzzle and is a fantastic companion pet for Mrs Holt, her 11-year-old german shepherd and alaskan malamute-cross, Naylor, and siamese cat, Princess.\nmedia_camera Champion racer Goldengrove Lad (left) in his former life as a champion greyhound racer at Wentworth Park. Picture: Craig Golding\n“They get on well as she (Naylor) sleeps a lot so Archie sleeps a lot,” she said. “They are couch potatoes.”\nMrs Holt said she was united with Archie after contacting Greyhounds As Pets (GAP), a program that ensures former racers find loving homes after the end of their careers.\n“I heard they are very easy to look after, they are very gentle and get on well with other dogs,” she said.\n“They are also very intelligent, low maintenance and are a hardy breed ‒ they’ve been going since the pharaohs in Ancient Egypt.”\nDuring his career Goldengrove Lad won 11 races and placed 10 times in 45 starts between December 2014 and April 2016 with eight wins at Wentworth Park, NSW’s largest racetrack.\nHe also took part in the Melbourne Cup, the world’s most lucrative race at Sandown Park, in November 2015 against the likes of Unlawful Entry who is one of Australia’s fastest greyhounds.\nMrs Holt said Archie had a weak right hock joint, a common injury among greyhounds as they raced in a circular motion putting a strain on the right side of their bodies.\nmedia_camera Goldengrove Lad, now known as Archie, won $45,000 during his career as a champion greyhound racer. Picture: Craig Golding\n“The first week I noticed that he had a bit of a limp,” she said. “I saw an old man who had greyhounds and he said to let him rest up.\n“I only took Archie for short walks and now he is fine.”\nSince then, he has become a local celebrity around Malabar and adores his new coastal lifestyle.\n“Everyone loves him,” Mrs Holt said. “When I take him to the park, people always come up and talk to him or stop and ask about him.\n“He is very much a talking point as he’s quite a pretty dog.\n“The first time I took him for a walk, he could smell the salt and his nose was so far up in the air. He had never seen anything like that before. It was funny.”\nTo adopt a through Greyhounds As Pets (GAP) click here .", "external_links": ["http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d364ebfbe93c2ae371a50263db27eb5a?width=650", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fsouthern-courier%2Fnews-story%2F328821c751f543d265e517e9f240a0c0", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent6.video.news.com.au%2FB4djh2OTE6M-SarYFewrjWdTljxmGhTn%2FUt_HKthATH4eww8X4xMDoxOjBtO_wVGe&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v2/origin:video_integrator.B4djh2OTE6M-SarYFewrjWdTljxmGhTn?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/ac3f3c5a72c12671eb9b8b1d7867df2f?width=650", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.css", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/510df9b8c803818775802e9193979d51?width=650", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=New%20life%20for%20champion%20of%20the%20tracks&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fsouthern-courier%2Fnews-story%2F328821c751f543d265e517e9f240a0c0", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fsouthern-courier%2Fnews-story%2F328821c751f543d265e517e9f240a0c0&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fsouthern-courier%2Fnews-story%2F328821c751f543d265e517e9f240a0c0", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/southern-courier", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-22T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:09:22.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
