His work has been cited by the Associated Press Sports Editors and the New Jersey Press Association, and his 2011 column on the tragedy at Mainland Regional High School won first place in the New Jersey Chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. \nAnastasia has written sports in the Philadelphia area since 1980, serving as a Philadelphia Eagles beat writer as well as a sports columnist and sports editor at the Courier-Post in Cherry Hill, N.J. before joining The Inquirer. More by Phil Anastasia Feb 21 \nFor John Doherty, it was an ideal opportunity. \nIt was a large public school with a rich tradition of sports success. It also was his hometown. \nOne year after resigning as head football coach at Paul VI High School, Doherty jumped back in the game Wednesday as he was named head coach at Eastern High School. \n\"I haven't been this excited in a while,\" Doherty said. \nDoherty spent 13 seasons as Paul VI's head coach, turning the Eagles into one of South Jersey's most respected programs. \n\"Over the course of his career, he has proven himself an educator, role model and winner,\" Eastern athletic director Jason Hill said of Doherty in a statement. \"Eastern Regional High School is extremely excited about the addition of Mr. Doherty as the football coach.\" \nDoherty replaces Dan Boguszewski, whose teams were a combined 6-24 in his three seasons as Eastern's head coach. \nThe Vikings were 1-9 in both 2014 and 2015 and improved to 4-6 last season. \n\"It's a great challenge,\" Doherty said. \"Playing against great schools, great coaches.\" \nDoherty lives in Voorhees, where Eastern is located. His young daughters are cheerleaders for the Voorhees Vikings' youth football program. \nHe is excited about taking over a large public-school program after years of coaching at a private school. \n\"This is one of the best schools in the state,\" Doherty said of Eastern. \"It's such a great sports school, boys and girls. The football program has a great history. We just need to continue to build things back up.\" \nDoherty was Boguszewski's defensive coordinator last season. Previously, Boguszewski had been an assistant under Doherty at Paul VI. \nDoherty is a guidance counselor at Phifer Middle School in Pennsauken. \nHe revitalized the Paul VI program during his tenure from 2003-15 at the private school in Haddonfield. \nAfter the Eagles went 0-10 in his first season, Doherty' teams were .500 or better in 10 of his final 12 years. That included marks of 9-2 in 2007, 9-1 in 2009, and 8-2 in 2010. \nDoherty will try to bring Eastern football back to South Jersey prominence. The Vikings' last playoff appearance was in 2013, when the team went 10-2 and made the South Jersey Group 5 final behind quarterback Tom Flacco in coach Dan Spittal's final season. \n\"It's such a great opportunity,\" Doherty said. \"Living in Voorhees, the chance to coach high school in this great community, it's very exciting.\" \n@PhilAnastasia", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:05:41.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
