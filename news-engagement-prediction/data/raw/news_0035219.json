China: Kim Jong-namâ€™s family fears for its safety \nTwo others were also detained in relation to the incident: A 25-year-old Indonesian woman called Siti Aishah, and a man who was accompanying her, reportedly a Malaysian national. \nPolice are also searching for other suspects including four men, who are believed to be involved in the case. \nKim Jong-nam was on his way to the Chinese territory of Macau, where he had been reportedly residing under China's protection. \nThe 46-year-old, was targeted in the shopping plaza at the airport and had not yet gone through passport control, a senior government official said. \nA second autopsy on the body will take place on Saturday after Wednesday's first autopsy was reportedly inconclusive, a senior Malaysian official said. \nHowever, Selangor state police chief Abdul Samah dismissed reports that a second autopsy would have to conducted. \nNorth Korea said it would categorically reject Malaysia's autopsy report, and accused Malaysia of \"colluding with outside forces\", in a veiled reference to rival nation South Korea. \n\"The Malaysian side forced the post-mortem without our permission and witnessing,\" North Korea's ambassador Kang Chol said after Malaysian police rejected demands made earlier in the week to return the remains. \n\"We will categorically reject the result of the post-mortem conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance.\" \nMalaysia hit back by saying the country's rules must be followed. \n\"While in Malaysia, everyone has to obey and follow our rules and regulations. That includes North Korea,\" Inspector General Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar, told a local news agency. TV prank \nOn Saturday, Indonesian police said that the Indonesian detained suspect, Aishah, thought that she was allegedly taking part in a reality television prank. \n\"She was probaly just used without realising it was an assassination attempt,\" Indonesian Police Chief, Tito Karnavian said according to l ocal media. \nKim mostly lived outside of North Korea, including recently in Macau, Singapore and Malaysia, rendering him as the least likely candidate to have been the possible successor to his father . \nHe had said on several occasions over the years that he had no interest in leading North Korea.
