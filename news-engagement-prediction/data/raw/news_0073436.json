Cristiano Ronaldo pulled a goal back but it wasn’t enough to stop Real Madrid slipping to just their second La Liga defeat of the season. \nIt means the gap between themselves and Barcelona remains at just one point, with Real Madrid retaining a game in hand over their rivals. \nZinedine Zidane was scathing of his side afterwards. \n‘We need to be more focused in future games because if you don’t concentrate, you get punished. In those 10 minutes, we weren’t clever or ready,’ he said. \n‘We had chances but we made two errors and they scored two goals. \n‘We had 80 minutes to rescue the game and tried but we lacked many things today. \n‘We had the chance to pick up points and we didn’t do it. I hope this has no psychological effect on us.’ Valencia celebrate after the match (Getty) Zinedine Zidane looks on (Getty) \nSergio Ramos though put the shock defeat down to bad luck rather than the wrong attitude from the Real Madrid players. \n‘Two mistakes at the start penalised us. The team went out to play the game we wanted to from the first minute. \n‘Our attacking play sometimes is very risky and we lost the ball twice and conceded a goal each time. \n‘For me, there was no lack of attitude at any moment. We have to turn the page and learn from those mistakes. La Liga is very long and a lot of things can happen.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:31:28.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
