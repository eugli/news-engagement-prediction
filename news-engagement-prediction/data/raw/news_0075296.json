NOAH SEELAM/AFP/Getty Images Alok Madasani's father holds up a smartphone with an image of his son at his residence in Hyderabad on Feb. 24, 2017. \nOne victim, 32-year-old Srinivas Kuchibhotla, was killed in the attack. The other two, Madasani and 24-year-old Ian P. Grillot, were wounded and are reportedly recovering. \nThe alleged shooter, Adam W. Purington, used “racial slurs” before opening fire and yelled, “Get out of my country,” witnesses told reporters. Early Thursday morning, Purington was arrested at a Missouri restaurant where a bartender said he claimed he had “just killed two Middle Eastern men.” \nPurington has been charged with murder. The FBI is working with local law enforcement to determine whether the incident was motivated by bias. \nA friend of Kuchibhotla and Madasani told the New York Daily News that the two men were engineers originally from Hyderabad, India. Grillot was at the bar separately and attempted to intervene in the attack. He counted the gunshots and tried to stop the shooter when he believed the shooter was out of bullets, The Kansas City Star reported . \n“I guess I miscounted,” Grillot told the Star, adding that he was trying to prevent the attacker from hurting more people. \nA GoFundMe campaign set up to assist the family of Kuchibhotla , the man who was killed, had raised nearly $350,000 as of Friday morning.
