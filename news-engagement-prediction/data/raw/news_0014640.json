Splash News 4 Michael Jackson’s youngest son Blanket was pictured making a rare public appearance in Los Angeles on Saturday night \nThe growing teen was dressed casually in a striped blue polo top and brown trousers for the casual outing at the popular celebrity haunt. \nHis outing comes weeks after his sister Paris gave a head-line grabbing interview with Rolling Stone , in which she claimed her pop icon father was killed in 2009 in what she says was a “set up” . \n“He would drop hints about people being out to get him. And at some point he was like, ‘They’re gonna kill me one day,’” Paris revealed. \n“It sounds like a total conspiracy theory and it sounds like bulls***, but all real fans and everybody in the family knows it. It was a setup. It was bulls***.” Splash News The 14-year-old, who’s name is Prince Michael Jackson II, was seen making a way out of Catch restaurant after having dinner with friends Jackson kids' Stars Wars show \nShe added that “a lot of people” wanted him dead. \nAnd Michael’s only daughter believes she will get justice, cryptically describing it as a “chess game.” \nShe continued: “It’s a chess game. And I am trying to play the chess game the right way. And that’s all I can say about that right now.” \nWhen Michael Jackson died in June 2009 he was in the midst of preparing for an ambitious number of comeback performances at London’s O2 Arena, and despite AEG Live winning a wrongful death lawsuit against the family, Paris still believes they played a part in his sudden death.

We’d be in school, meaning downstairs in the living room, and we’d see dust falling from the ceiling and hear stomping sounds because he was rehearsing upstairs.” \n“AEG Live does not treat their performers right,” she alleges. “They drain them dry and work them to death.” \nShe also blames Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, for getting him hooked on anaesthetic drug propofel, which lead to his death. \nGot a story? email or call us direct on 02077824220", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T11:35:45.357+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
