Beyoncé really did announce her pregnancy to kick off Black History Month on February 1. \nThe 35-year-old singer took to Instagram to announce she and husband Jay Z would be expecting not one, but TWO new additions to the Carter family. \nDo you know what this means? Blue Ivy is going to be a big sister! \nThis also means we should expect plenty of future musical material from both of these superstar artists about their flawless family. \nThe Instagram photo, which broke records and racked up over 8.7 million likes, showed Queen Bey kneeling over lush shrubbery as she gently caressed her belly. \nThe Instagram caption reads, \nWe would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. – The Carters \nIt’s official! \nBut let’s take a good look at that photo… \nDid you know Beyoncé subtly included her 5-year-old daughter Blue Ivy in the Instagram photo? I bet you didn’t! If you look closely, you’ll see that the “Formation” singer is kneeling over a bed of ivy. \nAbove her is a bright, blue sky. Now, you do the math… That’s obviously a gracious nod to Bey and Jay’s first child! Giphy \nWhat is not obvious, however, is if there are any other hints in the photo that may reveal the potential baby names Beyoncé and Jay Z could have in mind. \nNot only are there plenty of different flowers and plants to choose from, but there are also a ton of different colors that could help them brainstorm the perfect name for their two twins. \nIf Blue’s name is blue, what would stop Beyoncé from naming her kid purple, pink, yellow or peach?! I rest my case.
