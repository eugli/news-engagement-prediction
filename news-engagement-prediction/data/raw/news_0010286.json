Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017 \nA CNN/ORC poll released on Friday found that 53 percent of Americans oppose Trump’s Muslim ban compared to only 47 percent who support it. It also found that 49 percent believe it harms American values while only 43 percent believe it protects them. Finally, it found that 60 percent of Americans oppose Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico while only 38 percent support building it. \nWhat is perhaps most striking about Trump’s response to the poll is the fact that it reveals how he has been watching CNN in the first place. After all, this is the same network that Trump has publicly denounced as “fake news” . At the same time, this behavior is consistent with reports that Trump’s incessantly watches TV , which even included updating one of the White House’s TVs so he can watch the news while eating his lunch. \nOverall, the poll found that 45 percent of Americans either strongly or moderately approve of the job that Trump has put in as president so far, while 52 percent of Americans either strongly or moderately disapprove of his current performance.
