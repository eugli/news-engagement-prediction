Take a tour before Stacked even opens the doors, in the photo gallery above. At Stacked, meats are brined, cured, and smoked in-house, and all sandwiches come on breads, subs, and rolls by Pearl Bakery and Lovejoy Bakers . Pascuzzi’s menu includes snacks and entree-size salads but focuses on updated takes on old-school sandwiches, like a pork and veal meatball sub involving truffle pecornio. Pascuzzi and Lovejoy Bakers also collaborated to develop a Danish-style brown rye bread recipe, aka rugbrød ( see the full menu here ). In a last-minute twist, Multnomah Whiskey Library -alum Jeanette Conner is leading the bar program and will mix seasonal cocktails. For those on the go, bottles and boxes of wine, cans of beer, and other to-go drinks will be available. Stacked Sandwich Shop throws open the doors tomorrow at 11 a.m. Moving forward, it will operate Monday through Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:07:37.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
