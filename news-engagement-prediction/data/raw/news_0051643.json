From mid-March the cash situation will be back to the pre-demonetization days. So, will people start using cash more and depend less on digital payments? In the last three months the government has made significant effort to make it easy and ubiquitous to use digital payments. Lot of banks are also seeing an increased preference for digital payments. In an e-mail interaction, Ritesh Pai, Senior President & Country Head, Digital Banking, Yes Bank discusses digital transactions and how India could become a less cash economy. Edited excerpts: \n\nGovernment has a set a goal of 2500 crore digital transactions in 2017-18. Do you believe it can be higher than that? How do you see this happening? \nBanks are currently conducting around 75-80 crore digital transactions every month (as per RBI statistics). This is equivalent to annual transactions in the range of 800-1000 crore. The pace of increase of month-on-month transactions is very encouraging, particularly on back of the recent demonetization drive and as well as the impetus provided to digital payments in the annual Budget. \n\nThe overall trajectory will certainly depend on the overall adaptation of UPI and BHIM app which was recently launched. At Yes Bank we are very confident that the system as a whole will be able to surpass the targeted numbers if we work synergistically across banks, fintech and other payment providers. \n\nHow many daily digital transactions are made at Yes Bank. How does this compare to volumes in November/December 2016? \nYes Bank has been prioritizing digital – internet and mobile banking with its customer and particularly, post demonetization, there has been a surge in digital transactions at Yes Bank. Between October and December 2016, we have witnessed almost 50 - 60% growth on our internet and mobile channels and over 120% transactions on Yes Pay Wallet. In January 2017, the momentum in internet and mobile transactions has been sustained and we have witnessed an incremental growth of 6%. Yes Bank has over 40-45% of market share of UPI based transactions. \n\nAs cash has returned post demonitisation, more people are actually using cash. Why is it that people prefer cash to digital transactions. Do you believe we need more 'ease of use' to enable digital transactions? \nWe have seen a definite change in consumer behavior towards digital modes of transactions, particularly in our internet banking & mobile apps, as also cards even post the remonetization. \n\nFurther, at Yes Bank, we believe there are two key pillars which are crucial to the success of a digital economy. First, the transactions have to be economically profitable at unit level. Second, banks with the intervention of regulators have to support interoperable and an open architecture with standard protocols for any kind of digital payment. \n\nOverall, do you believe the Budget gives a boost to digital economy? \nDigital Economy was certainly the top focus area of the Union budget. Setting up of the proposed Payments Regulatory Board within the RBI & the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) to specifically enhance cyber security for the financial sector; specific tax sops for POS (Point of Sales) machine components as well as the e-payment framework for all payments made to the government, are short & midterm transformational measures to further enable India’s transition to a digital economy. \n\nA key to digital transactions is a good broadband infrastructure. Do you believe there are technology bottlenecks on way to building a digital economy? If so, which are these? \nInfrastructure issues are progressively improving and the Bharatnet initiative announced in the Budget will provide a further impetus to this. \n\nHowever, till such time, Yes Bank has successfully launched a SimSePay product across many states in India, which enables users of non-smart (feature phones) to undertake simple, secure payments transactions using encrypted SMS, at a fraction of a cost of Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) and other options.
