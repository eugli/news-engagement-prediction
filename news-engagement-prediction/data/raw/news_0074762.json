This year's bluebonnets have burst into color recently. These were spotted along the Ennis Bluebonnet Trail on Texas Highway 183. Wild flowers are blooming on the side of a road in near Aubrey, Texas. Past seasons have brought bountiful color to state parks and highways like these sunflowers in full bloom near Brownsville. A bee sucks nectar from a wildflower at Rockport Cemetery, March 19, 2012 in Rockport, Texas. Wildflowers bloom at Rockport Cemetery this year in Rockport, Texas. A butterfly rests on a wildflower at Rockport Cemetery, March 19, 2012 in Rockport, Texas. Fields of wildflowers can be seen at Rockport Cemetery, March 19, 2012 in Rockport, Texas. Past season have brought bountiful color to state parks and highways like this Devils River Horsemint. Lyndon B. Johnson State Park & Historic Site near Stonewall expects to see bluebonnets, Indian paintbrush and other flowers. \nEverybody hold onto your bonnets: Wildflower awesomeness is on the way. \nSo predict flower officials at the University of Texas' Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, who say Central Texas' eagerly anticipated spring wildflower season may not only arrive early but could last several months rather than the typical March-April rush. \n\"Fasten your seatbelt,\" said Andrea DeLong-Amaya, the center's director of horticulture, in an article posted at the center's Wildflower News. \"Wildflower season is taking off faster than you expect.\" Bluebonnets bloom off Interstate 37 in Corpus Christi in this 2015 photo. Wildflowers have bloomed early this year and could thrive longer thanks to fall and winter rains and warm January-February temperatures. AP/Corpus Christi Caller-Times \nPlentiful fall and winter rains, they say, coupled with unseasonably warm February weather, have conspired to produce early blooms and the possibility of palpitation-inducing wildflower abundance. \nTo wit: Flowering baby blue-eyes and the violet blooms of Texas mountain laurel are already evident around the Austin region, DeLong-Amaya said, and spiderworts are engaging their purplish spidey senses near Lady Bird Lake. \n\"The extra warmth from downtown probably pushed those blooms out a little faster,\" she said. \nDelong-Amaya also forecasts formidable flower power from dainty buttercups, otherwise known as pink evening primrose, despite their erratic showing over the last few years on Hill Country roadsides. \nMeanwhile, Kris Kirkwood of the Native Plant Society of Texas says Drummond phlox and greenthread should be looking spectacular down on the central Gulf Coast within a couple of weeks. \nAll of this could be thrown into chaos with a late freeze, but hearty bluebonnets should thrive nonetheless. They're already flowering at the center, Delong-Amaya says, but it's too early to know whether their slower-blooming sidekicks, Indian paintbrush, will enjoy a mic-dropping performance similar to last year's.
