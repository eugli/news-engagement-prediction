Lack of policy 'could greatly increase financial risks' \nAPRA warned in the speech that lack of policy and regulatory action could make the financial risks poses by climate change \"greater and more abrupt\". \n\"There could be either sharper, more significant policy changes and market adjustments down the track, or the physical impacts of climate change could become more severe, more likely and more unpredictable,\" Mr Summerhayes said. \n\"It's unsafe for entities or regulators to ignore risks just because there is uncertainty, or even controversy, about the policy outlook. \n\"Like all risks, it is better they are explicitly considered and managed as appropriate, rather than simply ignored or neglected. \n\"So what can you expect to see from us? A greater emphasis on stress testing for organisational and systemic resilience in the face of adverse shocks. \n\"Just as we would expect to see more sophisticated scenario-based analysis of climate risks at the firm level, we look at these risks as part of our system-wide stress testing.\" \nAPRA's intervention follows a similar though more pointed warning two years ago by the head of the Bank of England about the threats climate change posed to financial stability. \nIt comes in the wake of the Paris Climate Change Accord, which committed the world to taking steps to keep global temperature rises below 1.5 degrees Celsius. \nAPRA's speech addressed the risks identified by the Bank of England: physical risk around the effects of climate change transition risk from the shift towards a zero net emissions economy liability risk for company directors, trustees, and insurer \nClimate change is the \"tragedy of the horizon\", Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned in his landmark 2015 speech. \n\"We don't need an army of actuaries to tell us that the catastrophic impacts of climate change will be felt beyond the traditional horizons of most actors - imposing a cost on future generations that the current generation has no direct incentive to fix.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T13:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:58:11.008+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
