In October, Iraqi parliament banned all production, importation and sales of alcohol. Fines for violating the law can be as much as $21,00 dollars, but that’s not the only repercussion to be feared. Many illegal liquor stores have encountered violence from military personnel and militiamen when discovered. Other businesses survive in a web of constant and increasingly costly bribes. “If I didn’t pay the police, they’d put me in prison,” underground liquor store owner Wali Mani told VICE News correspondent Isobel Yeung.\nThis segment originally aired Feb. 3, 2016, on VICE News Tonight on HBO.\nUnder Saddam Hussein, Iraq was a more secular nation where drinking was permitted. Today, the country is controlled by a Shia-Muslim majority government, which seeks to create a more conservative society. Those who support the ban say it upholds the country’s constitution and the pillars of Islam.

They need work to survive,” he told VICE News.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Inside", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Finside-an-illegal-speakeasy-in-baghdad"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:04:42.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
