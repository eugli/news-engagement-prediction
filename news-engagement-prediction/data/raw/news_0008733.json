That makes no sense. It has to be across the board or not at all. We are either 4lb weaker or not. It takes away the change's credibility.\" \nKelly, who is on the brink of having her claim reduced to 3lb, admits it has taken her \"a long time\" to get outside rides despite her historic victory on Tea For Two, in the colours of her mother Jane, at Kempton in 2015. \n\"As a girl you have to perform to a very high standard to get noticed,\" she added. \"It was the ride on Agrapart that got me noticed whereas my granny could have won on Tea For Two. \n\"I will probably heading out to France again this summer and you never know I might get a few more rides.\" \nTurner would return if allowance was in Britain \nHowever, Hayley Turner would consider coming out of retirement if a similar allowance was implemented for female riders in Britain. \nSpeaking on ITV's Opening Show, Turner, who retired in 2015, said: \"It was a bit of a shock, I was really surprised. Personally, if I'd achieved what I'd achieved with a 4lb allowance, I'd feel like I was cheating a little bit. It just doesn't seem fair on the lads, who are struggling as well.\" \nWhen asked by Matt Chapman whether she would then consider coming back to the saddle if such a change was implemented, Turner added: \"Business wise, you've got to think about it, so yeah, I definitely would.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T18:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:28:31.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
