If you had any doubt that the singer was going to give us her very best Gaga tonight, she's already proved otherwise with a game-day warmup that came to slay. From sporting a custom pink \"Gaga\" helmet and jersey to hitting the football field in high heels, she's been documenting each moment of her prep today on Instagram and Twitter.\n First, she gave us her best pre-show dance warmup sans pants (hair fan included, of course):\nGettin' too funky in the dressing room. While my best friends side eye me from the couch for bein a ham 😂 so happy my friends and family are. Let's go men it's gametime!🏈🏈🏈🏈🎤⚡️\nA video posted by xoxo, Joanne (@ladygaga) on Feb 5, 2017 at 2:03pm PST", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BQJV_9vFCri/"], "published": "2017-02-06T07:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T02:09:37.046+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
