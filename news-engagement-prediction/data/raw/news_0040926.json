Story continues below \n“I have a girl and she’s 13 now and I got her when she was 18 months. That money is still the same amount I get for her now. I make anywhere from 14 to 16 cents an hour. That’s my wages.” \nMarie says no foster parent is in the program for the money, but with the attention now being paid to the foster care system after the death of Alex Gervais , she thinks it’s time the province stops ignoring foster parents. \nThe basic monthly rate for foster parents in B.C. is $803.81 per child 11 and under and $909.95 per child 12 and over. It’s more for children with physical, mental, behavioural or emotional needs. \n“Just look after the children, give [us] money to look after the kids to be able to feed them and take them to the store and buy them new clothes once in a while,” she said. \nBut the minister for Children and Family Development says even small changes aren’t easy to make. \n“Foster parents are aging and some are retiring from fostering and we want to be able to attract new good people in. We’re constantly reviewing what we do,” Minister Stephanie Cadieux said. \nMore money for the ministry is promised in the upcoming budget, something Marie will be watching for. \n“I want to see what Ms. Christy Clark has to say about foster children – foster families,” Marie said. “We’re people too.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T12:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:19:58.174+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
