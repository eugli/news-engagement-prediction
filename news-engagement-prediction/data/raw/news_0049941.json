Families will finally have effective choice and control over who provides the services that they actually want and need. Get mad, in the right places. Hollie Hughes and her son Fred. \nThe National Disability Insurance Scheme is a game changer for people with a disability and everyone who loves and supports them. Families will finally have effective choice and control over who provides the services that they actually want and need. \nThis comes after a period of limited funding, where a paternalistic attitude towards those with a disability meant you got what you were given and you ought to be grateful for it. \nWe have recently heard disability advocates complain about the NDIS funding being tied to some budget cuts. There have been accusations that the Turnbull Government is using it as a political football. \nWell, I’m calling it as rubbish. This rhetoric is both naive and damaging, leading the public to feel politicians are playing politics with our most vulnerable citizens. Total BS! \nWhether those in the disability community understand it or not, the NDIS needs to be funded. The money needs to be found so this life changing initiative currently being rolled out can continue. Early intervention is key. Hollie Hughes and her son, Fred. (Pic: Supplied) \nI’m a small government person, so a tax-and-spend mentality around the NDIS doesn’t sit well with me. The government needs to find the savings somewhere and complaining about every effort to find them is counter-productive and not directing our anger to the right place.
