Ali's medical records chronicle his deteriorating mental health, his terror at the prospect of another sexual assault, the fear of harassment and bullying by certain guards and his difficulty living in an isolation unit, the only place his safety was assured. \nIt was in May last year that Ali moved to the area reserved for those with acute mental health or protection needs, where his every move is monitored. The notes of consultants report how Ali continued to find his situation \"perplexing and upsetting\", and how he saw \"escape or death as a realistic solution\". \nIn October came a removal order signed by Papua New Guinea's immigration minister, Rimbink Pato, followed by a notice from PNG's Immigration and Citizenship Service Authority that Ali had been determined not to be a refugee. \nThis came as no surprise to Galbraith or Susan Ditchfield, a GP whose first contact with him was through Doctors for Refugees. \n\"Ali was unable to complete the refugee status determination process because of his illnesses and the panic attacks that were triggered each time he was expected to speak of what happened to him in Iran,\" says Galbraith. \"Rather than being an indication of his not being a refugee, this was an indication of how unwell he is.\" \nThen, on Christmas Eve, came the news that Faysal Ishak Ahmed, a 27-year-old Sudanese refugee, had died from injuries suffered after he fell inside the isolation area not far from of Ali, who witnessed the frantic efforts of a doctor to save him. \nAli saw Ahmed taken away and was asked to sign a statement about what he saw, but he did not know of the death until he received a message from Galbraith that night. An hour later he began working on four-part cartoon that told the \"true story of Faysal\", completing the task at 7am on Christmas Day. \nHe called it \"Happy Bloody Christmas\", and told how helpless he felt (\"I could feel the pain he had inside but I could not do anything to help him\") and expressed his anger at the ambivalence of the guard who told the doctor Ahmed had been \"doing fine\" before he fell (\"Why would he say he was doing fine? He was not fine.\") \nA couple of weeks later, Ali sent me a message introducing himself and offering a cartoon called 'How people die in Offshore processing centre' that attempted to sum up the utter hopelessness of the situation he and many other detainees face on a daily basis. \nThen, on January 29, he was told his allegations of sexual assault and abuse had not been substantiated and that he would be returned to the main compound where he says his attackers and harassers remain, prompting his decision to begin a hunger strike. \n\"Eaten Fish has received a deportation order, but he wants people to know that he is not on hunger strike for that reason,\" the Greens' Scott Ludlam told the Senate this week. \n\"He is on hunger strike because he has been the victim of sexual assault, chronic sexual harassment and abuse in Australia's immigration prison camp. He cannot bear the suffering anymore.\" \nGalbraith and First Dog are in daily contact with him, but so far have been unable to convince Eaten Fish to eat. In messages to me, Ali says he now weighs 46.7 kilos, which he says is close to the weight of Bobby Sands, the Irish nationalist, when he died in prison in 1981. \nFor First Dog, it is a bizarre experience, chatting on a messaging app to someone who is withering away. \"I tell him you'll get so weak that you won't be able to talk to me any more, and then you'll really be alone, so I want you to understand that that's coming,\" he says. \n\"What am I to say? 'Mate, eat a sandwich, you'll be all right.'? I can't say you'll be all right. I want him to end the hunger strike, I really do, and I'm encouraging him to do that, but I'm not able to say it's going to be OK and you'll make it through because I don't know that.\" \nThe best hope for Ali is that he is reassessed, his protection claim is upheld and he is included in the resettlement deal with the US, where a network of cartoonists have committed to help him access the services he will need to recover. But there are too many unanswered questions, there is too little time and Ali's reservoir of hope has run dry. \nOn the messaging app, I ask Eaten Fish why he wants to die. He replies that he does not want to hunger strike and has \"pain inside\", but that this method of dying gave him the chance to tell his story of suffering to the world. \n\"I think you should give me the right to die and stop this torture and suffers and pains,\" he said in one message. \"I have no energy left to tell my stories to Australians any more.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:16:30.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
