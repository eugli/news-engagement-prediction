Born in 1928 in Ireland, he studied medicine there and, already an artist, moved to the United States in 1957. Here he took on many roles, including that of editor in chief of Art in America magazine and part-time director of the visual arts and the film and media programs at the National Endowment for the Arts. He has written epoch-shaping criticism, published novels, and produced a body of art poised on a line between Minimalism and Conceptualism. Strictly speaking, Minimalism is about blank matter, Conceptualism about dematerialized ideas. The late-1960s and early-1970s work in Mr. O’Doherty’s fine-grained solo show at Simone Subal — organized with Prem Krishnamurthy, founder of the art project P! — combines these essences. Four six-foot-tall wall sculptures are as narrow and plain as a carpenter’s level, their sides painted with flat Mondrian colors: yellow, red-orange, blue. Their recessed interiors, though, are lined with sheets of reflective aluminum that meet at sharp 45-degree angles and are incised with horizontal lines. Two large canvases, dating to 1975, appear from a distance to be empty, as if they were waiting for paintings to happen. Closer up you see that they’re marked with faint, wavelike tangles of colored lines. These paintings have an organic source: They’re magnified versions of small earlier collages made from hairs the artist plucked from his head. The incised lines in the sculptures have an unexpected source too: They’re based on the written form of Ogham, an ancient Celtic language dating at least to the first century. It has an alphabet comprising lines of different lengths and combinations, and many of the earliest surviving Ogham inscriptions spell people’s names. So Mr. O’Doherty has merged two modern art styles often defined as fundamentally objective — the one about unmetaphorical matter, the other about abstract concepts — and personalized them, even turned them into vehicles of self-portraiture: physical, in one case; cultural, in the other. And he’s done so without abandoning the multitasking complications that make art an invaluable speculative tool. My guess is that the full study of those complications in Mr. O’Doherty’s nearly 60 years of work has just begun.

Credit All Rights Reserved, Estate of Benny Andrews/Licensed by VAGA, New York THE HUMAN IMAGE: FROM VELÁZQUEZ TO VIOLA Through Feb. 18. Richard L. Feigen & Co., 34 East 69th Street, Manhattan; 212-628-0700, rlfeigen.com. Gallery exhibitions with hefty themes tend to be limited to a gallery’s holdings and what it can borrow. As the excellent “The Human Image: From Velázquez to Viola” demonstrates, the long-established Richard L. Feigen & Co. has abundant resources. The nearly 40 assembled works — including paintings, collages, drawings and photographs — have more highlights than can be pointed out here. This show is a chance to see reasonably familiar works in the intimacy of a gallery setting, including Max Beckmann’s 1926 “Portrait of a Turk” — of a man who misses nothing — and Picasso’s “Maya With a Boat,” a 1938 painting that portrays his older daughter as an endearing little monster. Less known are Marc Chagall’s “Self-Portrait With a Palette” (1917), an uncharacteristically smooth-surfaced portrayal of the artist as a hardened dandy with a red palette against a slate sky; and Édouard Manet’s solid little 1873 portrait of Berthe Morisot, fully clothed and alert, posing on a sofa in the artist’s studio. Carrie Mae Weems offers this work a tough riposte in the five photographs of “Not Manet’s Type” (1997), which considers some male artists’ tastes in (usually white) models and the urge to be an artist oneself. Velázquez, Hyacinthe Rigaud and Thomas Eakins represent social order with sober, strikingly realistic, even sympathetic portrayals of gentlemen across several centuries. Benny Andrews’s wrenching painting-collage “Study for Portrait of Oppression (Homage to Black South Africans),” from 1985, reminds us that the costs of such order are often dehumanizing. So, in another way, does Wangechi Mutu’s 2002 “Mirror, Mirror,” a photo-collage depicting a seemingly self-wounding woman. The most effective human images may be those that force us to look inward. \nAdvertisement ROBERTA SMITH Photo Bonnie Lucas’s “Smiling Girl,” from 1983, at JTT.

Bonnie Lucas made the memorably unsettling gouaches and assemblages in her JTT show “Young Lady,” curated by Marie Catalano, in the 1980s, but they’re all too timely now. The rosy color that dominates here is just a bit more frankly sexual and charged with menace than Barbie-doll pink. One gouache, “That Girl,” shows a translucent, misshapen face with a tightly closed rose in place of one eye and a blue hair bow jammed in the other; inside her fishlike mouth, two girls dressed like Alice in Wonderland are having a prim tea party. In another, also titled “That Girl,” the waterlogged heroine chokes on an off-brand Wonder Woman figurine with blond hair. “White Rock,” a four-foot-high assemblage, is even more direct: Against a background of gauzy pink clothing and yarn, white gloves and fake pearls, a plush female doll is attached upside down, as if crucified like St. Peter, but on a welter of contradictory demands and impossible expectations. From her spread legs rises a kitschy, thrift-store Easter egg that pictures a sweet domestic scene of anthropomorphized yellow ducks; above the egg rises a blond knockoff of Betty Boop giving a come-hither wink. It’s direct, in other words, but not uncomplicated. What makes it all so compelling, even heartbreaking, is Ms. Lucas’s obviously deep ambivalence. There is as much affection for found totems of saccharine girlhood as there is anger or rejection, as much unsatisfied yearning in her distorted images of conventional femininity as there is trauma or shock.
