Article continues below \nHleb has since revealed that he regrets leaving Arsenal at the end of the 2008 season, but at the age of 35 he is about to join his 12th club â€“ Russian Premier League outfit FC Krylia Sovetov (via L'Equipe ). \nThat may not sound like much to English fans, but in joining the club he will get to strut his stuff in front of crowds at one of Europe's most impressive stadiums. Article continues below Video: Twitter absolutely loves what Pep Guardiola said to Arter at full-time \nSovetov will be playing their home games at the frequently talked about Cosmos Arena, a 44,918 capacity super stadium that will be used as a venue for the 2018 World Cup. \nThe stadium comes equipped with a 65.5 metre high dome roof, which consists of 32 panels, with the whole project set to cost a whopping $370 million. \nFrom the pictures below, it will certainly prove to be a stunning place to play football, and at his age, it's likely he won't get another chance to call such a cathedral of football his home again. \nHowever, fans probably shouldn't expect him to lift too much silverware. The 2015/16 season saw Sovetov finish ninth in the table having been promoted the year before. \nThis term they are struggling again, and currently languish in 12th place in a 16-team table, and are hovering just three points ahead of the drop zone. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
