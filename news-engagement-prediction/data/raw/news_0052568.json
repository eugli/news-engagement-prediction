The statement does not directly mention those incidents or Jews.\nThe FBI said it is joining with the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division to investigate \"possible civil rights violations in connection with threats\" to the centers.\nThe White House statement Tuesday said President Donald Trump \"has made it abundantly clear that these actions are unacceptable.\" It followed a tweet by Ivanka Trump on Monday calling for \"religious tolerance\" after a series of threats Monday against Jewish community centers. She tweeted \"We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers,\" and used the hashtag #JCC.\nIvanka Trump converted to Judaism ahead of her 2009 marriage to Jared Kushner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:14:20.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
