Qualifying rounds are Thursday and Friday.\n\"Crashed ice is a combination of skating, downhill skiing and Rollerblading,\" Richard said. \"It's an extreme sport and it's pretty exciting for everybody.\"\nThis is the third year a downhill ice course has been built in the centre of Bathurst, and the second year the event has been part of the Riders Cup.\nOrganizer Bruno Richard expects athletes will reach speeds over 50 km/h on the Bathurst course at this week's Riders Cup. (Submitted by Bruno Richard)\nFongemie, who is also an organizer of the race, and the director of the CCNB in Bathurst, said it's a huge boost for the local economy.\n\"Everybody is talking about it,\" he said. \"All the hotel rooms are booked for the weekend and it's not only the skaters. It's everyone coming to town to see the show.\"\nLast year, the event attracted 6,500 spectators, and this year Richard expects at least 8,000.\n\"It's really amazing, if you like any kind of racing ... the courses are really spectacular with big jumps and the fans love it ... it's full of action\" said Richard.\nMild weather a concern Last year, mild weather forced organizers to re-schedule events in the extreme sport, also known as ice cross downhill. With above-zero temperatures expected Wednesday and Thursday, Richard is watching the weather closely.\n\"Last night it was really cold, so our team flooded all night to make sure we have the biggest amount of ice all over the track.\"\nOrganizers estimate more than 6,500 fans came out last year to watch competitors in the Riders Cup in Bathurst, and are hoping for 8,000 this weekend. (Submitted by Bruno Richard)\nThe course is about 450 metres long with sharp turns and big jumps, where Richard predicts \"some guys are going to get some big air.\"\nHe said it's been fun showing the track to the athletes, who come from as far away as Poland, Estonia, Switzerland and Australia.\n\"This year it's really something else,\" he said. \"I was at the track last night around midnight and we had a guy from the Netherlands and a guy from Belgium arrive, and they were just blown away with what the team has prepared.\"\nRichard expect athletes will reach speeds of more than 50 kilometres per hour on the Bathurst course.\nStudents big part of event\nRichard tried crashed ice back in 2008 in Quebec City and was immediately hooked.\n\"I didn't really know what it was ... and when I saw the starting ramp was 30 feet high and the first jump was 10 feet, I almost took a heart attack, but it quickly became a passion,\" he said.\nHis next challenge was finding a way to bring the new sport to Bathurst, where he works at CCNB.\n\"We decided to organize a race and involve the programs of CCNB,\" Richard said. \"We're well-known for trades and now we have 30 programs involved directly in the organization of this event.\"\nFor example, welding students built the starting gate, technology students are in charge of the timing, and the metal fabrication class made the trophies.\nCCNB Bathurst students have built four fire pits in partnership with ICI Acadie to warm spectators along the crashed ice course in Bathurst.\nThe main event in Bathurst is scheduled for Saturday at 8 p.m.\nThe Red Bull world championships in crashed ice will be held in Ottawa in March.\n\"Who would have thought that we would host a Red Bull crashed ice international sporting event in Bathurst?\" Fongemie said.\nWith files from Information Morning Moncton", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:34:51.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
