While the deal would require restructuring of contracts, both players are apparently interested. Albert and Thomas have both gone to two Pro Bowls in their careers. The problem for each player has been injuries. Albert has started every game he has played in three years with the Dolphins, but that has included just 35 of 48 games in that stretch, including 12 last season. Mike Garafolo of NFL Network reported last week the veteran would be available in a trade and possibly released with two years remaining on his contract. Thomas was also limited to just nine games this past year due to injuries, catching 30 passes for for 281 yards and four touchdowns, all of which were the lowest in the past four seasons. In six years in the NFL, he has never played a full 16-game season. If the trade were to go through, the Dolphins would likely utilize 2016 first-round pick Laremy Tunsil at left tackle. Ben Koyack could be asked to build off a solid rookie year for the Jaguars at tight end to replace Thomas.
