The FBI referred calls to the Olathe Police Department, which said it would discuss the case in further detail at a 4 p.m. Thursday news conference. \nThe shooting happened at around 7:15 p.m. Wednesday while people were watching the Kansas-TCU basketball game at Austins Bar and Grill in the Kansas City suburb of Olathe, said Olathe Police Sgt. Logan Bonney. He said one of the victims died at a hospital, and the conditions of the surviving victims weren't immediately known. \nPolice helicopters helped with the search before the 51-year-old suspect was taken into custody around 12:40 a.m. Thursday at an Applebee's about 70 miles to the southeast in Clinton, Missouri, authorities said. \nAn Olathe man the same age as the suspect was booked into the Henry County Jail in Missouri on Thursday on a preliminary charge of first-degree murder. Police would not say if he is the same person. \nAssistant Clinton Police Chief Sonny Lynch said an Applebee's bartender summoned police to the bar where the man was drinking because he said he'd been involved in a shooting. The unarmed suspect was taken into custody and interviewed by detectives from Olathe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:15:06.312+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
