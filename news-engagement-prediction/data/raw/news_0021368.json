Kushal shares have been hitting the 2% lower circuit since January 25 after BSE put it in the trade-to-trade category for unusual trading. The stock has produced eye-popping returns of 16,000% since August 2013. \n\nThe market capitalisation of Kushal, which stood at Rs 45 crore on August 8, 2013, rose to Rs 7,231 crore as on January 24 this year. The stock surge went relatively unnoticed among the wider sections of investors as the company is not tracked by analysts at brokerages. \n\nThe company posted consolidated net sales of Rs 1,589 crore in 2015-16 as against Rs 433 crore in 2014-15. In 2013-14, net sales were Rs 302.5 crore. Net profit soared 1,420% to Rs 98.9 crore in 2015-16 compared with Rs 6.5 crore the previous year. The sales and profit growth, however, did little to trigger analysts' curiosity in the company amid chatter that a few Gujarat and Mumbai-based operators were in volved in the stock's dizzy ascent. \n\nMarket watchers said these operators indulged in circular trading to push up the share price. \n\n“The stock was complete satta,“ said SP Tulsian, an independent equity advisor.“There is nothing financially to justify the rally. Before January 24, there were buyers for several lakhs of shares, now selling 100 is difficult. This bares it all.\" \n\nThe market is agog with speculation that many high-net-worth individuals were lured into buying the stock on the promise of 2% monthly interest against assured investment sum in the stock. The only condition was that no shares were to be sold till instructed. \n\nOn several occasions, Kushal Tradelink witnessed trading volumes of around 20 lakh shares in a day. This probably helped the operators escape the regulatory glare.Often, price rise in stocks where trading volumes are thin attract regulators attention. \n\n“Some brokers convinced their old and loyal client base to invest in the stock for 24% annual return for which they got handsome commission from the operators,“ said a promoter of a large brokerage house. \n\nThis arrangement helped many investors make a killing in the stock, but BSE's decision to push the stock in trade-to-trade segment ended the party . When investors buy shares in this segment, they have to take delivery. Also, there are restrictions on daily stock price movements. \n\nThese days, investors are racing to exit the stock. On Thursday , Kushal had sellers of 20 lakh shares, while 353 shares were actually traded.
