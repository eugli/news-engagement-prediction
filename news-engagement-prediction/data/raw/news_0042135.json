But she gave up a steal of two in the seventh and led 5-4 without the hammer heading into the 10th.\nCarey was held to a single point to tie it. Homan, the crowd favourite at the Meridian Centre, hit to score two for the win with her last rock of the game.\nManitoba's Michelle Englot scored two in the 10th to pull out a 7-6 win over Quebec's Eve Belisle.

This year I'm crying because we won.\n\"The territories have not been represented the last two years. It's huge to have a territory in it this year, for sure.\"\nHer Yellowknife team then won their first game of the main draw, beating Prince Edward Island's Robyn MacPhee 9-4 at night.\nAlberta's Shannon Kleibrink, Manitoba's Michelle Englot, Nova Scotia's Mary Mattatall and Stacie Curtis of Newfoundland and Labrador also started out 1-0.\nP.E.I's MacPhee, Quebec's Eve Belisle, B.C.'s Marla Mallett, Northern Ontario's Krista McCarville and Saskatchewan's Penny Barker joined Carey at 0-1.\nKleibrink downed McCarville 11-6, Curtis beat Barker 7-4 and Mattatall edged Mallett 5-4.
