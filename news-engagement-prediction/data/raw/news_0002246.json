By: Manas Tiwari | New Delhi | Published: February 4, 2017 4:49 PM Yuvraj Singh scored 150 runs against England. (Source: Reuters) \nCricket is treated like a religion in India and players are no less than god. For almost two decades, Sachin Tendulkar dominated all the news but in last few years Virat Kohli and MS Dhoni have emerged as the most talked stories. While Kohli released a music video on Friday to reveal the story of his life, MS Dhoni’s story was portrayed on the big screen by Neeraj Pandey in the film ‘MS Dhoni: The Untold Story’. \nHowever, there cannot be a more inspirational journey in Indian cricket than that of Yuvraj Singh and what could be a better day to remember it than the World Cancer Day. From being a 9-year-old who wanted to do skating to the man who helped India lift World Cup in 2011, Yuvi has won many battles in life. \nYou may also want to watch: \n\nAfter India’s humiliating exit from the 2007 ICC World Cup, fans pelted Yuvraj’s house with stones but the braveheart responded in an admirable fashion by hitting Stuart Broad for 6-sixes in an over giving Indian fans one of the most memorable moment and also helped India lift the trophy. \nBut, his biggest fight was against the deadly disease of cancer which, not only he overcame but also defeated to make a return into international cricket. A disease like that can not only weaken the person physically but also kill him mentally but of course, Yuvraj wasn’t just another one of those players. He was a fighter, a true champion. \nAnd, right when we thought that he may already written the last page of his book, the ‘son of Punjab’ made another comeback to Indian team and scored 150 runs against England to roll back the years. It seems like his story was written in heaven and even God has not had enough of him. \nOn the World Cancer Day, we bow down to the 35-year-old legend for scripting so many unforgettable moments and hope that he will write many more in the coming years.
