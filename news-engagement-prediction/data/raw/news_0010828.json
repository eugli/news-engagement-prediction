The ensemble is usually in great demand during Thaipusam. — Bernama \nKUALA LUMPUR: Without fail, the urumee, thavil and the pambai will make their grand appearance during Thaipusam again. \nThe three musical instruments are played to accompany kavadi bearers as they fulfil their vows to Lord Muruga. \nThe urumee is a double-headed hour glass-shaped drum whereas the thavil is barrel-shaped. The pambai comes as a pair of cylindrical drums. \nThis drum ensemble, which originated in Tamil Nadu, India, would usually be in great demand during Thaipusam, said Urumee Melam Musicians Association president B. Shiva. \n“As usual, we have already received bookings for this year’s Thaipusam and we are having a tough time meeting the demand. \n“There are between 500 and 600 urumee melam ensembles in the country,” said Shiva. \n“The association has registered 425,” he added. Doing penance: Some devotees fulfilling their vows at Batu Caves yesterday. Many came earlier to avoid the massive crowd on Thursday. \nBesides Thaipusam, these drums are played at temple functions or to accord a special welcome to VIPs at events. \n“We get a lot of satisfaction playing these drums,” said Shiva, 36. \n“It also lets us earn an income.” \nOne set of the urumee melam can cost anything from RM5,000 to RM6,000 and repairs, according to Shiva, can be costly. \nThe urumee melam , he said, was popular today. \n“The music is greatly preferred by the younger generation, particularly the youth, who have begun to learn how to play the drums,” he said. \nShiva said he was pleased that many Indians made their children learn the drums. \nThe association runs classes twice weekly in Kuala Lumpur. — Bernama \nRelated story:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:14:13.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
