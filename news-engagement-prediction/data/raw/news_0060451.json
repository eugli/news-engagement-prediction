(CBC)\nThe transportation agency refused to investigate the complaint because Lukacs is not obese , saying he was not affected by the allegations.\nLast September, the Federal Court of Appeal overruled the agency and said it had not followed the Canadian Transportation Act when it dismissed Lukacs's complaint.\n\"Can you imagine the Canadian Food Inspection Agency turning away a complaint because you are vegetarian?\" Lukacs said Thursday.\nDelta Airlines has not yet responded to CBC's request for comment. \n'Fundamental human rights' The case should provide certainty about this section of transportation law, Lukacs said. \n\"We are talking about fundamental human rights here.\"\nBumping obese or disabled passengers is \"inhumane,\" and contradicts Canada's one-person-one-fare policy introduced in 2008, he claims. \nThe rule requires airlines to cover costs on domestic flights for people with disabilities who are accompanied by an attendant or need additional seating. \n\"What the airlines are trying to do — Delta in particular — is pitting passengers against passengers instead of just accommodating … passengers who need that, which is what is supposed to happen in Canada,\" Lukacs said.\nHe says the Supreme Court's decision to allow Delta to appeal reflects how important this issue is to all Canadians.\nWith files from the CBC's Angela MacIvor", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:13:12.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
