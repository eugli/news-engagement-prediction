Twitter From Getty Images. It is fairly obvious, when looking at the economic data , that Donald Trump is largely missing the point when he blames China or Mexico for the decline of U.S. manufacturing jobs. “We want products made by our workers in our factories stamped with those four magnificent words—made in the U.S.A.,” the president declared during a photo op Friday at a Boeing plant in South Carolina. It was a solid applause line, even if Trump’s proposed solution—reforming the tax code to encourage more companies to build factories in the U.S.—ignores the fact that U.S. manufacturing output just hit an all-time high. The problem isn’t the amount of product being manufactured, but who is doing the manufacturing. Or, more accurately, what is doing it. As leaders in the tech community and experts in industrial manufacturing are aware, advances in artificial intelligence and automation are making it so that fewer people in the U.S.—and China and Mexico, too—are needed to operate machinery, build cars, or assemble devices. Robots, not foreigners, are the top long-term threat to employment and wages. And Bill Gates , for one, offers a real solution: a robot tax. In a fascinating interview with Quartz , the Microsoft co-founder and world’s richest man, suggests that the government should tax companies that replace human employees with A.I.-driven automation, in order to fund job training and other kinds of employment for displaced workers—the kinds of jobs robots can’t do and that humans can, like taking care of children or the elderly. “Right now, if a human worker does, say, $50,000 worth of work in a factory, that income is taxed,” Gates says in his interview. “If a robot comes in to do the same thing, you’d think that we’d tax the robot at a similar level.” Raising the tax level could also help “slow down the speed” of automation, Gates says, allowing companies to manage job displacement in warehouses and in other impacted industries, like trucking. It would also fund a significant redistribution of wealth, offsetting the trend of income accumulating to capital. “If you want to do [something about] inequity, a lot of the excess labor is going to need to go help the people who have lower incomes,” Gates says. “And so it means that you can amp up social services for old people and handicapped people and you can take the education sector and put more labor in there.” Gates’ suggestion could go hand-in-hand with another radical concept that has been gaining adherents in Silicon Valley: a universal basic income that would guarantee a minimum wage to all Americans, regardless of their work status. Y Combinator president Sam Altman has been a vocal proponent of the idea, which was previously proposed by conservative economist Milton Friedman. Nixon even tried to pass a version of Friedman’s “negative income tax” in the early 1970s, though the idea didn’t go anywhere. Altman’s own basic-income study has since led to a pilot program being implemented in Oakland. “I believe that we should view it as a basic human right to have enough money to afford food and shelter,” Altman told Bloomberg , referring to the study. “It’s an idea [that] makes sense to most children.” Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has also been an open supporter of U.B.I. “Rather than try to restructure our economy so it looks like the 1950s, I think we have to be honest with ourselves,” he told NPR last year . Tesla and SpaceX C.E.O. Elon Musk , meanwhile, has taken more of a “if you can’t beat them, join them” approach. “Over time, I think we will probably see a closer merger of biological intelligence and digital intelligence,” he explained at the World Government Summit in Dubai this week, making the case that humans should incorporate digital components to augment their intelligence and compete with machines. “It’s mostly about the bandwidth, the speed of the connection between your brain and the digital version of yourself, particularly output.” Perhaps a robot tax will hold Americans over until then.
