However, despite an £80million transfer fee and £570,000-a-week wages being mooted, he remained at Stamford Bridge. \nEdinson Cavani, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Wayne Rooney have all also come under consideration. \nHowever a move for Rooney was vetoed by Cannavaro with the Italian questioning whether he was the right fit, declaring: \"he simply doesn’t suit our style of play.\" \nNow Shu has revealed that the Chinese side were close to landing Falcao, who is experiencing a renaissance at Monaco this season, having scored 23 goals in 29 games for the French side. \nNonetheless, after Cannavaro again stepped in, the Chinese side pulled out - leaving Shu to apologise to Mendes, as they seek to keep their relationship with football's most powerful agent onside.

We had an overnight negotiation and Radamel Falcao was about to sign the contract to join us. \n\"However, the deal was scuppered by Cannavaro who later told us he doesn't suit our style of play. Price and reputation are not our only concerns. \n\"We had to apologise to Mendes.\" \nThe Chinese transfer window closes at the end of February, ahead of the 2017 CSL season, which kicks off on Friday. \nWhen the summer transfer window opens, Tianjin are expected to move once again for a new centre-forward, and Shu is bullish about what the summer holds for his side now that they are in China's top tier.

After we get promoted, he came. \n\"We also approached Diego Costa and other stars. It remains to be seen who will join us in June but I can assure you that the new players will be on the same level as Costa. \n\"Theoretically speaking, there is no limit on transfer budget in the summer. We can target whoever we want.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T21:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:44:38.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
