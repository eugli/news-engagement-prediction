I don’t need that amount of money, it’s too much for me,” the prizewinner told a Tatts official. His former colleagues became suspicious when he quit his job and quickly purchased a $600,000 house. \n“I’m going to share the prize money with my family. I’ll make sure it doesn’t change who I am, but I’ll definitely be able to live a better lifestyle, with a few more toys. \n“I love being out on the water so I’ll buy myself a boat and a jet ski, and my kids have been wanting the new iPhone 6 so they can have that now, and I might spoil them each with a new car.” \nIt's unclear what kind of agreement the parties reached, but the matter is scheduled to return to court on Thursday for final orders.
