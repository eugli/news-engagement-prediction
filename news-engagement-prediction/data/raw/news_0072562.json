Here are the top five. Photo by Jason Cipriani/CNET \nHow do you make a brand new device cheaper? Sell your old one. \nHere five sites where you can trade in used electronics for cash or gift cards, in no particular order. Amazon trade-in \nPayment method: Amazon gift card \nTurnaround time: Two business days \nAfter using Amazon's tool to identify the product you wish to send in, and describing its condition, you'll be given a value. \nOnce you ship the item (Amazon covers shipping) Amazon will ensure the item matches your original description. If it all checks out, your Amazon account is credited with an Amazon Gift card for that amount. If the item is in better condition than you described, Amazon promises to give you the higher value. \nYour gift card is usually available within two business days after Amazon receives the items. \nThe drawback? With Amazon's trade-in program , your money is locked to your Amazon account. Best Buy trade-in \nPayment method: Best Buy gift card \nTurnaround time: 10 business days \nGetting a quote is as simple as picking a product category, manufacturer, model and condition. Once you've filled out the questionnaire, the tool will estimate the value of the item. The offer amount, if you choose to accept it, will only be awarded as a Best Buy gift card. \nYou can either ship the item to Best Buy using a prepaid label, or find a local store that accepts in-store trade-ins. \nAs with Amazon, the drawback with Best Buy is that your money is locked into spending it with Best Buy. Plus, the turnaround time of getting your gift card is longer than Amazon, 10 business days after receiving and reviewing your items. Nextworth \nPayment method: Check, PayPal or Target gift card \nTurnaround time: 10 business days, plus a few more days \nUnlike the Best Buy or Amazon services, Nextworth lets you choose from a check, PayPal deposit or Target gift card for your items. (Finally, a service that gives you choices!) \nTo send your items away, you have two options: ship the items to Nextworth (it pays) or you go to your local Target store to trade them in and get a Target gift card. \nIf you choose to ship your items in, it can take 10 business days after the initial inspection for Nextworth to initiate your payment. Meaning, tack on several more days to actually receive that payment. Gazelle \nPayment method: Amazon gift card, PayPal or check \nTurnaround time: Within seven days \nGazelle is entirely focused on electronics. Like the other services, you provide a description of the devices and it gives you an estimate. \nGazelle lets you to choose from an Amazon gift card, PayPal payment or a check. You can expect payment within a week of receiving your item. eBay Instant Sale \nPayment method: PayPal \nTurnaround time: Within five business days \neBay Instant Sale is a quick way to get rid of old electronics, even if they don't work. Just answer some questions about the condition of your used device to receive an offer. eBay will pay for the item to be shipped in and then evaluate it once it has been received. \nIf your item is as described, you can expect a deposit into your PayPal account for the quoted amount within five business days. \nIf you have a PayPal debit card, that means you'll be able to withdraw that cash from an ATM.
