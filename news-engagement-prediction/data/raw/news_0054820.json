Some people like to reach the edge of orgasm and pulling back from the brink once or twice before letting go, while others edge numerous times before the main event \nThe method is supposedly great for making men more erect and offsetting any erectile issues. \nAnd it’s great for women too. \nResearch from OMGYes, an educational orgasm app, even suggests that edging is one of the most popular ways for a woman to masturbate. \nWhen it comes to carrying out the method, everyone is different. \nSome people like to reach the edge of orgasm and pulling back from the brink once or twice before letting go, while others edge numerous times before the main event. \nAnd then there are some who love edging so much that they will repeat the process over and over again without any release – talk about self-control.
