He had gone there to pick up his four-year-old son from a program, reports the station. \nLange, 37, was shot to death through the closed window of his car, the station reports. A passerby noticed shattered glass, saw Lange unresponsive and called 911. \nNaperville Police Cmdr. Louis Cammiso told the station Lange, of Oswego, was not robbed and authorities don’t believe the attack was random. \n“This is not a robber on the loose,” Cammiso said. \nLewis University Senior Vice President Raymond Kennelly told the station the university community is shocked over the sudden loss. \n“He always took extra time with those students that might be having any struggles in the class or any difficulty with the material. He was one of those professors that always invested extra time in those students, to help them succeed,” Kennelly said. \nA $5,000 reward has been offered in the case. Anyone with information is asked to call Naperville Crime Stoppers at 630-420-6006. © 2017 CBS Interactive Inc.
