When questioned he said that the other players were tired, but he had a time out left.\nThe same issue arose in putting the fourth line out in another game when down by one with minutes remaining and a time out. When questioned on it, he said reporters were second-guessing him.\nHe had massive usage errors, such as David Desharnais always getting the first shift as his top power play centre man for 34 games straight -- despite not getting a single point in that time.\n \nI don’t lightly call for a coach to be fired, but the mistakes were so simple and so obvious and he was costing his team games.\nWhat did Marc Bergevin think of my idea?\nHe said that he was in a foxhole with his coach and he would not rather have anyone else with him. No one else.\nInseparable buddies it seemed. Joined at the hip.\n \nNext chapter: PK Subban is gone in another moment that, even though I actually said it live on the radio that Subban could and would be traded, I still ended up saying “wow, I didn’t see that coming” when it actually happened.\nBergevin just doesn’t care what the popular sentiment is. If he thinks he can get a better player in Shea Weber then it does not matter to him that Subban was the most popular player in town in decades.\n \nFast forward one year and wow, he’s done it again. I did not see that coming.\nThe man who was his go-to guy no matter what, was now his get-out-of-town no matter what.\nWith the worst collapse in history Bergevin said he had no worries.\nNow with the team in first place in the division and fifth place overall in the conference, Therrien is fired .\n \nBergevin felt that Therrien deserved a pass because that .940 goalie Carey Price wasn’t there and he was replaced by that .900 goalie Mike Condon, Dustin Tokarski, Ben Scrivens.\nThis season, Carey Price is back so Therrien doesn’t get a pass, but guess what?\nAfter a .940 start for two months, Price is a .900 goalie again.\nTruth is: nothing gets you fired faster as a head coach than bad goaltending.\n \nThe irony here is I am the reporter who said the coach needed to get fired because he was an amateur and the GM said no way.\nWhen the coach stopped making all of those amateur mistakes and had an excellent season behind the bench, with mistakes of a much less significant level and some very talented hockey players --including the world’s best goalie -- letting him down, I said it would be unfair for Therrien to be fired.\nThen he’s axed.\n \nYou see what is at play here is two things.\nOne, something changed in Marc Bergevin, who said that he needed the team to change its energy.\nTwo, the players in Therrien’s fifth season seemed to have tired of his message.\nRumblings are moving in after the fact that there was some friction, though this is not from me.\n \nThe real reason a coach gets fired in his fifth year is the message is growing thin.\nThe players are tired of the same voice. The fatigue is everywhere.\n \nI never thought I would be the guy to say this, but here it is: He should have been fired last year. He was horrible. He was an amateur behind the bench.\nThis year, I don’t think he should have been fired.\nHis system is the same as many systems in the NHL so there’s nothing there.\nHe didn’t make fundamental errors behind the bench of the same level as last season.\nHis player usage, except for Galchenyuk at times -- such as not using him in 3 on 3 overtime or a shootout -- was much improved.\nHe coached well this year.\nThe errors that made me feel he wasn’t adequate for the job were gone.\n \nFor me, the players let him down.\nCarey Price let him down.\nSecondary scoring let him down.\nMore than anyone, Marc Bergevin let him down by not getting him a centre.\nWin the middle. Win the game.\nGalchenyuk struggling with his game after an injury means Danault is the team’s number one at centre.\nEveryone you talk to in hockey tells you that this is not good enough and it’s not close.\nBergevin has the finger pointing at him now because the players decide this.\nI have made the joke before that coaches are a dime a dozen.\nIt’s just a joke but the point I am making is put Scotty Bowman in there and no strength down the middle and .900 goaltending and you’re going to think Scotty Bowman should be fired.\n \nSo six losses in seven games and he’s gone.\n \nIn comes Claude Julien.\nHe was vacationing in Vermont, out of work for only seven days.\nThe Bruins gave the okay that the Habs could talk to him and he was hired before Therrien even knew that his job was in jeopardy.\nIt’s a business. It’s not kid’s stuff.\nAt 1 pm, Therrien had no idea. At 4 pm, he was unemployed.\n \nJulien is not only the right man for the job, he’s probably the only man for the job.\nHe’s a francophone.\nHe’s won a Stanley Cup.\nHe’s experienced at every level including representing Canada.\nHe can handle the fishbowl that is the Canadiens in this hockey-mad city because he’s already done it.\nI think the world of Julien who would talk to me after a playoff game in Boston for an hour in the rain about hockey in general and the series.\nNo one has shown me even close to the respect that Julien has over my career.\nI like him immensely as a coach and as a man.\n \nJulien can do this, but he’s going to need some help.\nHe’s going to need Price to be better than .900.\nHe’s going to need Galchenyuk to be better than he has been after his injury.\nHe’s going to need more than 10 goals in 7 games from his team.\nMost importantly, in the long run, he’s going to need his GM to get him a centreman.\nIf the team doesn’t get better down the middle, then he’s just putting lipstick on this to make it look pretty for a while.\n \nHe’s going to need all of this from the players that are on the squad and the better ones that are hopefully to come.\nIf Julien doesn’t get all these things, let’s be honest here, he’s just another Therrien.\nPhotos Claude Julien is the new head coach of the Montreal Canadiens", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:11:39.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
