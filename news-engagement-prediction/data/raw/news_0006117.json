Getty + Katie Buckleitner By Madison Feller Feb 03, 2017 On Thursday, while talking with MSNBC's Chris Matthews, Kellyanne Conway defended President Donald Trump's recent \"Muslim ban\" by saying that former President Barack Obama had a similar ban on the Iraqi refugee program after a so-called \"Bowling Green massacre.\" \"President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre,\" Conway said. \"Most people don't know that because it didn't get covered.\" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below However, most people don't know about it because there's no such thing as the \"Bowling Green massacre.\" And Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, is not afraid to shout it from the rooftops Twitter: Very grateful no one seriously hurt in the Louvre attack ...or the (completely fake) Bowling Green Massacre. Please don't make up attacks. — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017 In her tweet, Chelsea Clinton refers to a recent attack in Paris, where a French soldier shot a man who was trying to attack a security patrol, according to BBC . She also correctly points out that the massacre is made up. The real story is that in 2011, two men in Bowling Green, Kentucky, were charged with \"plotting to send weapons and money to al-Qaida operatives abroad,\" according to the Associated Press . The two men were mistakenly admitted into the country as Iraqi refugees and were later put in prison for pleading guilty. But Obama didn't ban Iraqi refugees; the incident prompted Obama's administration to slow down processing for Iraqis seeking special immigrant visas. Now if you look closely, you'll see that this \"massacre\" isn't the only thing Clinton has been calling out these days. Her Twitter is chock-full of sassy replies to various political news stories, and I have to say, I am here for it: Advertisement - Continue Reading Below — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017 Anyone taking him seriously. https://t.co/OxA461M47O — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 3, 2017 Is it really shocking at this point? https://t.co/2jfAbI9suW — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) February 1, 2017 Keep doing you, Chelsea.
