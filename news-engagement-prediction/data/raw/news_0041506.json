Credit: Pacemaker The Belfast Policing Commander has condemned the incidents.\nChief Superintendent Chris Noble said: “It is very early to speculate in terms of the people involved, but at the very least they are predatory criminals.\n\"It is also too early to say if the number of recent shootings in west Belfast are linked, but clearly there is an active line of inquiry around the involvement of violent dissident republicans.\n\"I would not want to speculate on exactly why individuals were targeted but there is never any justification for this violent, abusive behaviour.\"\nLast night saw an attack on a 16-year-old boy. Any civilised society would see that for what it is – child abuse.\n– PSNI Chief Superintendent Chris Noble He added: “There is only one police service in west Belfast and that is the PSNI.\n\"Policing only works when delivered with the community, and policing in west Belfast has seen real progress over the last five years in relation to domestic burglary and vehicle crime in particular.\n\"Unlike others who in recent weeks have resorted to child abuse, maiming people and acting as self-appointed judges, juries and executioners, we work in partnership with the community to resolve issues of concern while at the same time being held robustly to account by the local PCSP and the Policing Board.\"\nPolice say they will continue to work within communities to bring those responsible to justice.\nChief Superintendent Noble appealed for anyone within information to come forward.\n\"The dogs in the street may well know who is responsible, but what I need as the local police Commander is for people to come forward and give me any information, however apparently irrelevant,that our specialist detectives can use to secure a conviction,\" he said.\n\"Information is key in these crimes where victims are often traumatised and people emerge from and run back into the shadows.”\nWATCH: PSNI Chief Superintendent Chris Noble Play video Northern Ireland Belfast", "external_links": ["http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/442948608/PSNI_crest_normal.jpg", "https://twitter.com/PoliceServiceNI/status/832355828090941443"], "published": "2017-02-17T17:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:32:05.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
