That trend has led the company to focus development resources on the iPhone experience, leaving Android lower down in the priority list. “We have prioritized development of our products to operate with iOS operating systems rather than smartphones with Android operating systems,” the company said in its S-1 filing .\nSnapchat is very aware that consumers with an Android smartphone from Samsung, LG, Google, HTC, and other vendors aren’t getting an app that matches its iOS counterpart in quality. “If we are unable to improve operability of our products on smartphones with Android operating systems, and those smartphones become more popular and fewer people use smartphones with iOS operating systems, our business could be seriously harmed” the company says in the S-1’s business risks section.\nAndroid has a large lead over iOS in terms of overall worldwide smartphone marketshare, but clearly there’s no correlation between those percentages and Snapchat’s adoption / daily usage among the app’s millions of users. Android users have in the past complained about video quality differences between the two mobile platforms, and Snapchat is often cited as one of those apps that just feels better and smoother on iPhones, even if the user experience is meant to be identical.", "external_links": ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564408/000119312517029199/d270216ds1.htm#rom270216_2"], "published": "2017-02-03T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:17:51.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
