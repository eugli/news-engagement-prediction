Specialists decided his best chance was to be delivered by c-section seven weeks early, and he was rushed immediately to the hospital’s Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Little Freddie was born with a range of serious health problems and died aged just 25 days old (Photo: UGC) \nHe was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect, multiple cysts in his lungs, and persistent swelling and fluid throughout his body. \nMum Ingrid said: “Every day the NICU team would work tirelessly to help Freddie survive and find answers. Constantly thinking of more ideas, tests, investigations, blood transfusions, higher settings for his ventilation, bigger consultant discussions. Freddie had everyone fighting for him.” \nAndy, 33, said that although doctors had seen Freddie’s problems and conditions before, they had never come across them all in the same child at the same time. \nHe added: “They’d never seen anything like this before, they’d seen everything individually but not all present in one child. \n“On January 11 we got a call saying we needed to get to the hospital. We knew then that his days were numbered. \n“Every time he suffered, it would take the nurse a long time to stabilise him, and we realised that there was little if nothing else that could be done for him. \n“We told the doctor that the next time he showed us he couldn’t fight to let him go. \n“It was an incredibly painful decision that no parent should ever have to make but we had to put our own feelings aside and do what was right for Freddie.” Freddie's mum and dad are now hoping to raise £5,000 for new equipment at St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester (Photo: UGC) \nAfter Freddie passed away, his family were able to take him into a special room at the hospital where they could dress him and spend time together as a family. \nAndy described the bereavement service as fantastic, saying the support they received during that difficult time was ‘invaluable’. \nHe said: “They couldn’t have done enough, the staff really were incredible. Not just with Freddie and us, but also his older sister Ava, who is three. \n“Nothing was too much. When he died we went into this special room which was set up like a nursery, there were wardrobes full of clothes and toys, they even brought us a camera with an SD card so we could take photographs as a memory. \n“This entire service is funded by donations and we want to raise money to support that, as well as help pay towards new equipment for the NICU.” \nA GoFundMe page was launched on Tuesday, and has already raised more than £2,400. The family hope to continue raising money in Freddie’s memory with future fundraising events. \nTo support their campaign, visit www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/ingrid-platt-chance .
