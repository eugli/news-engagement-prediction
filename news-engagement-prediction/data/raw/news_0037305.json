Mark Stoops has hired former Eastern Kentucky head coach as the Cats' new special teams coordinator and outside linebackers coach, UK announced in a release Wednesday. \n“I could not be more excited to have Coach Hood join our staff,” Stoops said in the release. “He brings extensive experience and knowledge as a head coach, defensive coordinator and special teams coordinator. Having watched him at Eastern Kentucky, I developed great respect for him and I know he is held in high regard by the high school coaches in the state. He is a welcome addition to our program.” \nHood spent eight season as the Colonels' head coach from 2008-15, earning OVC Coach of the Year honors in 2008, and comes to UK after one season as the assistant head coach, special teams coordinator and tight ends coach at Charlotte, his 29th year on the sidelines. Previously, Hood served as defensive coordinator and secondary coach at Wake Forest from 2001-07. \nIn a statement, Hood expressed respect for Stoops and the program being built at Kentucky. \n“I am from northeast Ohio and I take a lot of pride from being from there,” Hood said. “Being from Ohio I have followed the Stoops family for a long time and they are known for being tough, hard-working and family oriented. All of those things are important to me as well. When I was coaching at Wake Forest and we had to play against Florida State, I noticed how well the defense played once Coach Stoops got there. They were very tough to play against. Also, being 17 miles away at EKU, I was always impressed with him and the discipline of his program. I was impressed with how he presented himself in the media and public with an honest and let’s-go-to-work attitude and how they have put together a really good strategic recruiting plan. I’m excited and honored to be a part of his staff.” Author", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:05:51.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
