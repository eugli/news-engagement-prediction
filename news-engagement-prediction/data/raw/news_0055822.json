But when Fallon was on hiatus over the winter holidays, The Roots hit the road for four gigs. \nLead guitarist Kirk “Captain Kirk” Douglas” tries to stay active during a schedule shift. “I think that when you’re on tour, when you’re traveling, it’s a great opportunity to see the city and you can drive around to see the city—or you can actually run the city,” he says. “I find that that’s a good way to kill two birds with one stone.” Whenever possible, he asks the hotel concierge for a map, or if there isn’t a map handy, he just runs aimlessly. His motto: “Treat my body like an instrument. Our bodies are instruments.” \nDownload the MapMyRun app to keep track of where you’re going in a new city. \nRelated: A Beginner’s Guide To Running \nPrioritize Comfort \nGallant is on fire: Grammy-nominated for his debut album for his debut album Ology and named to Forbes’ 30 Under 30 . Gallant toured with Sufjan Stevens in 2015 and will open for John Legend on this year’s Darkness and Light Tour. Gallant hadn’t traveled much before he started touring, but he’s thankful for the “enormous amount of context” it gives him about the world and people in it. \n“I even had this misconception,” he says, “I was like, ‘oh man, I’m about to do something crazy. I’m about to go on tour. It’s gonna be like the ‘70s. This crazy debauchery lifestyle!’\" The truth was more low-key. “It’s a letdown when the fans get on the tour bus and say ‘hi’ and they see me in the corner playing Mario Kart and drinking an orange juice,” he says. \nThat’s right—stars live just like you sometimes. Gallant’s advice for frequent travelers? “I would say it’s worth it to get all your airline miles. Don’t fly uncomfortably. There’s so many cool ways to do that: get a travel credit card, make sure that you value all of your minutes and hours,” he says. “Fill those in between spaces of traveling with the utmost comfort that you can possibly achieve in that moment.” \nDo What You Love \nThaddeus Dixon has played drums and acted as musical director on tours with the likes of Ne-Yo, Meghan Trainor, and Bryson Tiller. He’s now touring Europe with Tiller and The Weeknd. \nOn his first tour ten years ago, Dixon was shocked at the sheer amount of people around him every single night. He quickly learned that it’s important to be a people person. But there is one tip that stands out the most.. \n“First, I feel like you have to be inspired and motivated to be doing whatever you’re doing,” he says. “I’ve met some people on tour that are not happy being on tour. So that’s the first thing: You’ve got to make sure you’re happy doing what you’re doing. It starts right there.” \nDon’t Overburden Yourself \nWitt Lowry is an independent rapper who toured with Watsky and Daye Jack last fall. \nHe learned that sometimes when you plan too much, you fall short. Lowry thought he’d be able to get tons of writing done in the van while traveling from city to city. “I had all these plans,” Lowry says, “and when it came to reality it was do the show, get back to the hotel room, pass out, wake up at 5 a.m.” It was tough to keep up with his diet and laundry needs, especially traveling in a minivan with five people. \nBut though tour had its struggles, Lowry kept a grateful attitude. After all, he was living his dream. “I don’t think there was ever really a time where I was like, ‘oh, I’d rather be home.’” \nRelated: How Keeping a Gratitude Journal Made This Writer More Thankful \nSet Healthy Habits Early \nSynth-pop duo Great Good Fine OK’s latest headline tour started in January. Singer Jon Sandler says he and his bandmate, Luke Moellman, are “well-oiled machines” on tour, but they had one major hiccup about two years ago when Sandler got bronchitis and laryngitis before their tour’s final show. But he pressed on. “That was really, really hard. I compare it to like you hear those stories about a mother lifting a car to save her kid,” he says. \nRelated: 26 Ways to Avoid Getting Sick This Winter \nNow, he’s even more diligent about staying healthy on the road. About a month before a tour starts, Sandler starts running daily. He also avoids alcohol on the road. \nAnother point of pride: “We never eat fast food. And that’s not to say we spend a lot of money on food,” he says. “We just eat a lot of Chipotle—I don’t know if you consider Chipotle fast food, but the fast food-iest place we’ll eat is Chipotle.” \nCheck Your Expectations \nMatthew Russell, Kevin Ford and Trevor Dahl make up EDM group Cheat Codes. They don’t typically tour in the traditional sense—but they travel constantly. “Honestly, a lot of it is flying on the weekend to different places,” says Russell. “It’s definitely interesting doing the electronic music because it’s not always stereotypical tours where you’re on the road for a month. It’s more fly, fly back home, fly somewhere, fly back home.” \nThe Cheat Codes guys didn’t hit the road with presumptions. “We just believe in creating from nothing,” says Russell. “If you can have zero expectations going into something, you’re going to have a better time.” \nFord follows Russell’s lead as far as healthy habits. The group’s Instagram page is sprinkled with “#cheatcodeoftheweek” posts or uplifting messages for their followers. \n\"Check In With Yourself\" \nSinger/guitarist Cobi has been on “countless tours.” When he first started touring, he loved the feeling. But eventually he missed important people in his life. “Relationships may tend to fall apart when you’re gone for that long,” he says. \nEven with all the travel, Cobi says he’s more present on tour than in any other environment because you don’t have the option to think about anything beyond the current hour, or sometimes, minute. \n“My tip would just be always check in with yourself,” he says. “Remember to breathe, check in with your breath; check in with yourself; don’t run so hard that you forget about yourself.” \nRelated: How Deep Breathing Can Help Calm Your Anger \nBring Plastic Bags \nHolden Glazer is the lead singer of boy band The Catching , which went on DigiTour last winter. “You’d load in in the morning, sound check, then you’d have like six hours between that and the show,” Glazer says. That's a lot of time to sit. “I watched myself, but we knew at one point that it was really easy for us to just try and eat something because we’re bored,” he says. \nDigiTour meant hours crammed together in a van traveling from the east coast to their last stop in Seattle. When one band member got sick, they all got sick. Glazer eventually created a new rule: Used tissues go in Ziploc bags, not on the van floor. For future tours, he plans to pack Vitamin C and create a workout routine that is transferrable to the road. \nLean on Friends \nBefore Mike Stud was rapping with the likes of J. Cole and Lil Wayne, he was a closer on the Duke Baseball team. After his stellar All-American freshman season, he had to get Tommy John surgery and never pitched healthy again. \n“And that second that I found out I wasn’t going to be able to play again, I got fed up and decided I was going to take my mind off things,” he says. Using a $50 mic in his room, he started making music and fell in love with it. \nStud implements health habits from his athletic career on tour. “Sometimes you’ve got to do things that your body doesn’t feel like it wants to do, but for the better good of your goals of where you want to be, what you want to look like, what you want to feel like, how you want to perform,” he says. Stud's close friend and Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Marcus Stroman keeps him up to date with workout programs and vents with him about a life constantly on the road. \nMost recently, Stud and his team did 40 shows in 55 days across the country. “I’d say I’ve had those hard physical times,” he says, “but the hardest, I’d say it’s mental and emotional. It sounds like it’s all peaches and cream, but it’s really more of a battle with yourself. Trying to remain a normal person, and then your life isn’t normal. As much as it sounds like a great thing, which it is, it’s also just weird.” \nFind Good Mentors \nMiC LOWRY is a five-piece R&B group out of England. Last fall, they joined Justin Bieber’s Purpose Tour. It was a crash course in how to maintain mental health on the road—and at a new level of success. \nMembers Kaine Ofoeme and Michael Welch say they realized Bieber wasn't just a superstar, but also a human just like anybody else, when he arranged to have soccer goals and a soccer ball brought to each of the tour’s venues. The six guys played soccer (or as the guys prefer it, “football”) together in front of the stage before the crowd was allowed in. Bieber also encouraged them to keep focusing on their music—not hype. \nEsco Williams, MiC LOWRY’s creative and music director, says he took on the role of “the bad guy” during the tour. With the soft touch of somebody who genuinely cares about them, Williams told the guys, “You aren’t what you think you are when you’re on that stage,” he says. “Remember that at the end of this tour, you might have to go and get a job. This is really temporary. Don’t take it for granted.” \nWilliams’ perspective is not exclusive to the big stage, though. “I think everybody that travels a lot in a high-pressure environment will question where they are, who they are,” he explains, “so you start to understand why big celebrities have their breakdowns or why people go off the rails…” \nAs MiC LOWRY keeps going, Ofoeme recommends: “Just eat well, drink well and stay in contact with people that are important to you.” \nMiC LOWRY is on a headlining tour until March 11. \nEstablish a Routine When You Return \nYou probably know X Ambassadors for their double platinum single “Unsteady,” but the band has been touring for years with bands like Panic! At The Disco and Muse. In the beginning, frontman Sam Harris pretended to be the band’s manager so the industry would take them seriously. At one point, they could only afford to eat because they had done a show sponsored by Taco Bell and got $5 coupon “Taco Bell Bucks” out of the deal. \nMost recently, X Ambassadors headlined The VHS Tour from June to December. \nHarris says that coming home from tour is “such a mindf---.” . \n“You get back and you’ve been running from place to place to place for so many days that it’s almost like you end up kind of pacing back and forth and back and forth in your house, because you can’t stop moving, until you realize that there’s no place to go,” he adds. Knowing this, Harris makes sure that the first thing he does the morning after returning home from tour is to go on a run.
