By Kevin Winter/Getty Images. In a new interview with the BBC , Angelina Jolie openly addressed her ongoing divorce from husband Brad Pitt . When asked by journalist Yalda Hakim if she would like to comment on the initial child-abuse investigation about an alleged incident that involved Pitt, Jolie, and their children in an airplane last fall (Pitt was later cleared of charges), Jolie kept things fairly vague. “I don’t want to say very much about that, except to say it was a very difficult time,” she replied. “And we are a family. And we will always be a family. And we will get through this time and hopefully be a stronger family for it.” The interview took place in Cambodia, as Jolie prepares for the release of her upcoming Netflix film First They Killed My Father , based on the country’s violent Khmer Rouge era. When asked how she was coping with the divorce, which began with a separation last September, Jolie broadened her response, saying that “many people find themselves in these situations” and her whole family has “been through a difficult time.” “My focus is my children, our children, and my focus is finding this way through,” she said. “And as I said, we are and forever will be a family, and so that is how I’m coping. I’m coping with finding a way through to make sure that this somehow makes us stronger and closer.” Jolie and Pitt have six children together. They were officially married in 2014, after several years in a long-term relationship. Both have maintained relatively low profiles since the divorce proceedings began, though Pitt made a surprise appearance at this year's Golden Globes . Both have also largely refrained from speaking publicly about the divorce, instead letting representatives handle the bulk of the attention. The Cambodian premiere of Jolie's new film was a family affair, however (sans Pitt). She brought all six children to Siem Reap, and called the film her way of “saying thank you to Cambodia.” “Without Cambodia, I may never have become a mother. Part of my heart is and will always be in this country. And part of this country is always with me: Maddox,” she continued. Maddox , 15, is her eldest son. Jolie adopted him from the country in 2002.
