The tour, aptly called Kevin & Karen Dance , kicks off in July and tells the story of their romance through a sequence of various routines, including the Waltz, Cha Cha Tango and Salsa. During an interview with Radio Times , Kevin talked about the concept behind the tour and how he managed to end up with Karen - much to everyone's surprise. \n\"In the end we decided that we wanted to tell our story,\" he explained. \"It's kind of a weird thing that we're together really. Karen's from Venezuela, I'm from Grimsby and we met in New York. When we got together, I think a lot of people thought that it would probably never work. It is insane because we are so different as people but somehow we compliment each other and we get on really well. It's kind of an odd story that we're together and we're an odd couple but we decided that our own show would be the best way to do it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:16:03.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
