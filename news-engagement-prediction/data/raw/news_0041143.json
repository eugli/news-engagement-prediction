That clip, for the anthemic 56 Nights single, was interspersed with footage of police officers murdering black civilians. “ Feds ” is itself interrupted by the police banging at the door, waving a warrant, picking “ the dawgs up like an infant. ” At the end of an album—and really, a larger creative period for Future—where time is hazy, even flat, and where stories are recalled in bits and pieces rather than a clean narrative arc, “ Feds ” is heavy with perspective, and with a sense of consequence. \nIn recent years, Future has rendered his romantic and sexual relationships in ways that make them seem cold, even adversarial. Here, he raps about being “ idolized by these groupies ” who sneak iPhone pictures of him, then punctuating the scene, “ Preying on me, I ’ m the predator/Preying on me, I ’ m the predator. ” If that sort of mindset seems like it would be all-consuming, it is; in the first verse, he raps, “ You don ’ t wanna feel my pain/It ’ s gon ’ drive you insane. ” And yet, he ’ s at his most effective when he turns the lens outward: “ The sheriff wanna remain nameless/Tryin ’ to be Instagram famous. ” It's a cutting observation in a song whose title could be a New York Times headline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:14:09.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
