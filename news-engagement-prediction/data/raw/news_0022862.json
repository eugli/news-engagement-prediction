Photo: Nick Moir \nWhile the metro trains would boost frequency and capacity on the Bankstown Line, the council said it was concerned calls for extra stations on the new railway had been overlooked. \nThe council said any downgrading of rail services to St Peters would \"significantly compromise\" rezoning changes made in 2011, and the suburb's ability to \"continue to operate as a vibrant, connected and liveable neighbourhood\". \nSt Peters resident Cathie Hughes said overcrowding would worsen if trains on the T2 or T4 lines stopped at the two inner-city stations. \n\"We have no idea how our stations are going to be serviced,\" she said. \n\"The only answer is to have one of those other lines stopping at St Peters or Erskineville. But at peak hour they are packed.\" \nMs Hughes, who works in the CBD in an administrative role, said the government should be expanding the suburban rail network instead of converting an existing line. \n\"Why would you duplicate something that already exists when Sydney is crying out for heavy rail?\" she asked. \nTransport for NSW declined to reveal how it plans to service St Peters and Erskineville with rail once the metro line opens. \nHowever, the transport authority said it would ensure that trains continued to service the two stations during the shutdown of the Bankstown Line to allow it to be converted to carry metro trains. \n\"The existing infrastructure allows for trains to continue to stop at Erskineville Station and St Peters Station,\" a spokesman said. \nThe conversion of the existing line also means thousands of commuters who catch trains on the Bankstown Line west of Bankstown Station risk losing direct services to Sydney's CBD. \nThe government has yet to reveal whether it will extend the metro line from Bankstown to Liverpool. \nIf it decides against an expansion, commuters who catch trains from stations such as Carramar, Villawood and Chester Hill will need to transfer between metro and suburban trains at Bankstown Station. \nTransport for NSW said planning was under way on the delivery of rail services between Bankstown and Liverpool to cater for commuters once the metro line opens in 2024. \n\"Passenger loads will be regularly monitored to ensure the needs of customers are met,\" the spokesman said. \nThe authority said Sydenham Station's role as a key interchange on the network would become more important for people from the city's south and south west because it would be where they would switch to metro trains to reach destinations such as Barangaroo, North Sydney and Macquarie Park. \n\"This new interchange option delivers faster journeys and more options for customers and will help reduce crowding at CBD stations,\" the spokesman said. \n\"Converting the Bankstown line to Sydney Metro allows extra suburban trains to be allocated to other lines.\" Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:38:38.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
