He's a decent player for a guy in his 70's!\"\nA Trump spokesperson confirmed the report itself a few hours later, saying he had originally only intended to play a few holes.\nBecause President Trump is a divisive figure among so many, that led to something of a social media backlash for Rory McIlroy. The responses were varied - many golf fans had no issue with Rory playing golf with the President - but there were a large number who did. A sampling of the negative comments:\n@McIlroyRory Rory, Rory, what are you doing whoring yourself with Trump?\nâ€” sarah mac (@MacMacaslin) February 21, 2017 I've no problem with @McIlroyRory choosing to stay out of Northern politics.

It basically reinforces old stereotypes.\"\n\"I literally can't believe that McIlroy has done this,\" he continued.\nPiers Morgan was the highest-profile figure to come to his defense:\nSo @McIlroyRory plays golf with @POTUS & promptly gets viciously abused too.
