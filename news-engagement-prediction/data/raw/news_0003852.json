We asked some of our favorite black food bloggers to share their most cherished recipes with us. From a seductively gooey mac and cheese t o a healthy jambalaya that packs a spicy punch with fewer carbs, the internet raves over these inventive recipes that don't skimp on flavor.\nSome of these black bloggers are self-taught cooks, others are registered nutritionists and others have cooking running through their vein s because their ancestors were acclaimed chefs .\nEvery recipe below has a story â€” and those stories reflect the accomplishments, struggles, heritage and culture of these bloggers. One blogger dreamed up a mouthwatering comfort food recipe after a long day at a tough job, while another perfected the art of cornbread after drawing inspiration from the \"ash cakes\" her great uncle made when working in the fields of a rice plantation. These recipes are the perfect way to bring the past to the present in honor of Black History Month.\nLet these bloggers take you and your taste buds on a journey. And if you've been calling your favorite food delivery joint more often than you'd care to admit, perhaps it's time to put down that takeout menu and fire up your oven. Cooking these beloved recipes is the most delicious way you can bring these bloggers' stories into your own kitchen.\nMacaroni Pie from Inner Gourmet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:55:35.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
