Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill has written to New York's congressional delegation to seek reimbursement. He says it cost about $24 million to guard the Trumps and Trump Tower during the 2½ months between Election Day and Inauguration Day. The original estimate was $35 million. When the president is not in New York City, the department estimates that it costs $127,000 to $146,000 a day to protect the first lady and their son. If Trump is in New York City, the police department puts the estimate at $308,000 a day. The New York Times (http://nyti.ms/2mohohI ) notes that Trump has not yet returned to the city since his inauguration.
