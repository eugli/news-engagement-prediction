From Sergio Aguero’s brace to his dive in the penalty area. The eight-goal thriller had absolutely everything. \nAt half-time, it looked as though Pep Guardiola’s side were going to be on the wrong end of a shock. Raheem Sterling may have given his side a 26th minute lead but Falcao’s header levelled things up six minutes later. Article continues below \nThen, in the 35th minute, there was a major talking point. \nAguero went through on goal, rounded Danijel Subasic before being tripped. It was surely a penalty but referee Antonio Lahoz decided it was a dive by the Argentine striker and brandished a yellow card.

Five minutes later, the away side took the lead through Kylian Mbappe to take a 2-1 scoreline into the break. \nAt half-time, pundits analysed whether Aguero deserved a penalty or not. Despite the forward making a meal of it, we reckon it should have been given. \nBut Aguero’s teammate Willy Caballero seemed to think he didn’t deserve a spot kick. A video has emerged of Caballero analysing the controversial incident on foreign TV and his reaction says it all. \nTake a look: \nYou can watch the full nine-second video of his reaction by clicking here . \nLuckily for City, they weren’t left fuming by the referee’s decision not to give Aguero a penalty. \nFalcao missed the chance to put Monaco 3-1 ahead after half-time with a penalty of his own before Aguero equalised just before the hour mark. \nFalcao made amends with an unbelievable chip a few minutes later but Aguero added his second to make it 3-3. \nJohn Stones made it 4-3 to City in the 77th minute before Leroy Sane’s late goal gave them a two-goal cushion heading into the second-leg. \nWhile Aguero’s dive may have got lost in the carnage that followed, Caballero certainly isn’t going to let him forget about it in a hurry. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
