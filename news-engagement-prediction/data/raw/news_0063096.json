Grinstead's disappearance on Oct. 22, 2005, was marked by a ceremony in Ocilla.

(AP Photo/Elliott Minor, File)\nThe search for a teacher and former beauty queen who vanished from her south Georgia home nearly 12 years ago finally yielded some answers Thursday as authorities charged a former student with her murder.\nTara Grinstead was last seen on Oct. 22, 2005, a day she spent helping contestants in a Miss Sweet Potato pageant and attending a cookout with friends in her farming community of Ocilla. The 30-year-old was reported missing two days later after failing to report at the high school where she taught history.\nGeorgia Bureau of Investigation agent J.T. Ricketson announced at a news conference Thursday that a tip days ago led authorities to arrest 33-year-old Ryan Alexander Duke and charge him with murder.\n© (Georgia Bureau of Investigation via AP) This Feb 22, 2017 photo released by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation shows Ryan Alexander Duke, in Georgia. Duke was arrested by authorities on murder charges in the disappearance of a high school teacher in rural south Georgia more than 11 years ago. Duke had been a student at Irwin County High School, where Grinstead taught, about three years before the teacher vanished, Ricketson said.\n\"There's relief for everybody that they have made an arrest, but people now are wondering what did really happen,\" said the Rev. Joey Whitley, a Baptist minister and elected chairman of Irwin County, about 165 miles southeast of Atlanta.\nMany questions remain as to what exactly happened to Grinstead, who in 1999 won the title Miss Tifton, named for a nearby city, and later competed in the Miss Georgia pageant.\nRicketson, the lead investigator, declined to discuss Grinstead's relationship to the suspect and left open the possibility Thursday that others were involved. He wouldn't even say whether Grinstead's body had been found.\nBut Ricketson noted that after following hundreds of leads in the case that included interviewing numerous potential suspects, Duke had never been among them.\n\"This gentleman never came up on our radar through the investigation,\" Ricketson said.\nDuke was being held at the Irwin County jail. It was not immediately known if he had an attorney.\nFollowing Grinstead's disappearance, the house where she lived alone in Ocilla was found locked, with her cellphone inside. Her dog and cat were home and her car sat parked in the driveway. But Grinstead's purse and keys were gone. A latex glove — the type worn by police officers and medical workers — was found in her front yard.\nRicketson said police suspected foul play from the beginning, but found little physical evidence. Technically she remained classified as a missing person.\nConnie Grinstead, the missing woman's stepmother, told reporters at Thursday's news conference outside a local courthouse that she thanked God \"for answered prayers.\"\n\"We always believed that it would be solved,\" she said, reading a statement. \"We just did not know when.\"\nGrinstead's 2005 disappearance had prompted an outpouring of support in Ocilla, a community of about 3,300 people, and surrounding Irwin County.\nVolunteers fanned across the area to help search on foot, while a Tara Command Center was set up with a telephone tip line and a website, http://www.findtara.com. Rewards of $100,000 were offered for Grinstead's safe return or for information leading to an arrest and conviction if she was harmed.\n\"Right after it happened, there were people on everything from ATVs to horses looking for her over the whole entire county,\" Whitley said.\nFor 11 years and four months, the search for answers never stopped entirely. As the GBI announced Duke's arrest, a sign asking \"Where's Tara?\" still hung outside the sheriff's office. The separate phone number routed to the 911 center was still open as a designated tip line.\nRicketson gave no details of how investigators linked Duke to Grinstead. He said a person, whom he declined to name, approached authorities with a tip days earlier. And he gave an open-ended answer when asked if more arrests were possible.\n\"That's a very good question,\" Ricketson said. \"Again, we have several more interviews to do.\"\n___\nAP Researcher Rhonda Shafner contributed to this story.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T02:22:49.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
