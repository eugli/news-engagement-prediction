T+L Newsletters \nCherry blossoms, anyone? \nTravelers based in cities all across the United States—from the West Coast to the East Coast and plenty of destinations in the south—can take advantage of steeply discounted airfare to Tokyo this spring. But according to the Airfare Spot , you should pack your bags immediately: arrival dates become available in March. \nFlights start at $459 round-trip with All Nippon Airways, for trips originating in Nashville, Tennessee. \nFlorida-based fliers can score a trip to Tokyo for as little as $504 round-trip out of Miami, and only $549 from Orlando International Airport. \nANA is also servicing Tokyo with flights from the New York City metro area. Tickets from Newark Liberty International Airport cost $535 round-trip, though it’s possible to book a student fare for $499 from John F. Kennedy International Airport. Both are non-stop flights. \nDelta is also offering bargain fares to Tokyo starting next month. The airline is selling flights to Japan for $500 from Washington, D.C., $516 from San Francisco , and $549 from Charlotte, North Carolina. \nThese cheap fares can be found scattered throughout the months of March and April with both ANA and Delta—a perfect excuse to see the country’s famous cherry tree blossoms, which are forecasted to reach peak bloom between March 25 and early April.
