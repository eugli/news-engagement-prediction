Presidents should not have unlimited power,\" he added, concluding his post: \"For pizzas, I recommend seafood.\" \nAn expert on constitutional issues, Johannesson was a political science professor before being elected head of state last year. \nHis laid-back and discreet style has won him plaudits from the public with a January opinion poll showing he had an approval rating of 81.4 percent. - AFP ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:59:59.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
