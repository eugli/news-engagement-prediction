Anyone obstructing efforts to \"effectively implement the law\" faces one year in jail and a fine. \nIn an emailed statement the temple said \"4,000 police and military\" had been deployed with blockades \"now prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving\". \nImages circulated on social media showed unarmed police arriving to cordon off the temple. Thousands of sect supporters are believed to be inside the temple. \nThere have been several failed attempts to persuade the former-abbot to leave the temple. \nHistorically, secular authorities have been reluctant to intervene in the affairs of the clergy in the Buddhist-majority country. \nCritics among the conservative mainstream Buddhist establishment accuse Phra Dhammachayo of promoting a buy your way to nirvana philosophy. \nThe temple is also accused of having close links to ex-premier Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a 2006 military coup. \nThe administration of his sister Yingluck, who was also prime minister, was also toppled by the military again in 2014. \nThe sect runs a sophisticated PR operation, including its own channel as well as hosting several spectacular gatherings of orange-robed monks each year. \nIn the last 30 years the Dhammakaya temple has grown exponentially, raising tens of millions of dollars. \nLast week Thailand's new king chose an 89-year-old abbot to become the country's new Supreme Patriarch - or top monk - ending a three year impasse over the position. \nThe selection of Somdet Phra Maha Muniwong also saw a Dhammakaya-linked abbot passed over for the top job. - AFP/de", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:18:27.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
