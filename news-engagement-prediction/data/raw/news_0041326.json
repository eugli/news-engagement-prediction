Bengals tackle Andrew Whitworth (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:58 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:58 p.m. ET \nUnless blown away by a massive contract offer from Bengals management, something he's unlikely to receive, Andrew Whitworth is poised to at least dip his toe into the free-agent waters. \nWho can blame him? \nFREE AGENCY: Victor Cruz visits Panthers following release from Giants \nAfter 12 NFL seasons without a playoff victory, the 35-year-old left tackle has different priorities at this point than a mere money grab. Whitworth wants to play for a legitimate Super Bowl contender. \nThat’s why Whitworth sounds inclined to see if a championship-caliber team makes a pitch and exactly how the Bengals are addressing their own roster heading into the 2017 offseason before making any decisions about his playing future. \n“I love Cincinnati and want to be there,” Whitworth told co-host Solomon Wilcots and me Monday on SiriusXM NFL Radio. “I’m pretty positive things will work out in a way that I’ll be there in the end. But I want to take advantage of the opportunity of being free and listening to what other people have to say. I think that’s the right way to do it. \n“At this point in my career it’s about the challenge, the excitement of trying to win that Super Bowl. I want to make sure wherever it is, and hopefully it’s in Cincinnati, that team is prepared to try and fight for that trophy.” \nThe Bengals took a step backward in that regard last season, failing to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2010 with a 6-9-1 record. Cincinnati was hit hard in free agency last offseason as it lost quality veterans such as safety Reggie Nelson and wide receivers Mohamed Sanu and Marvin Jones. Another round of departures for a team that builds primarily through the draft is possible with Whitworth, right guard Kevin Zeitler and cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick headlining a lengthy list of pending unrestricted free agents. \nMORE: Five best free agency fits for Alshon Jeffery \n“We had a great stretch run there where we were playing really well and making the playoffs and didn’t seem to make anything happen with it for one reason or another,” said Whitworth, who has started 164 games since being drafted by the Bengals in 2006. “Then you finally have that year where it was a down year and things don’t shake your way. You don’t really get a lot of breaks. You have some guys go down (with injuries). You didn’t play up to the potential you played a few years before with the same guys and realize, ‘Hey, you know what? We’ve got to rededicate and refocus.’ \n“I want to see what (Bengals management) is trying to do. Are we keeping Kevin Zietler or Dre Kirkpatrick? There are other guys on the roster who are going to be free and what we’re thinking [about doing] in the draft, that’s important. When you’re a veteran, you realize how important all those pieces are and the commitment to all that. We’re close and I hope we can make some moves to solidify ourselves.” \nBased upon conversations with Bengals brass, Whitworth believes he would remain at left tackle if re-signed even though he has shown the ability to play guard as well. \n“If there was a special situation that some team would want me to play left guard I’d be open to hear it,” Whitworth said. “But I think most teams would want me to play left tackle (or) if anything maybe right tackle. I really have the ability to play both. It’s just always been a situation that’s where the Bengals have needed me to be.” \nIf Whitworth were to sign elsewhere, 2015 first-round draft choice Cedric Ogbuehi would be the leading contender to take his spot. Ogbuehi, though, is far from a sure thing after struggling with injuries and inconsistent play at right tackle during his first two NFL seasons. \nOFFSEASON: Best trade fits for Jimmy Garoppolo \nWhitworth said part of the growing pains being suffered by Ogbuehi and fellow offensive lineman Jake Fisher, a 2015 second-round pick who also has failed to nail down a starting spot, is having to adjust from playing in spread-style offenses in college that don’t demand as much from their blockers. \n“When you get into these NFL rushers – the power, the speed, the bull rush and all those kind of things – it’s just different than college football,” said Whitworth, who played in a pro-style system at LSU. “The ball is not out as fast. The plays take a lot longer. You’re playing grown men.” \nTo that end, Whitworth said Ogbuehi could benefit from a strong offseason of weight training to build upon what he called “uber” ability. \n“You can’t just be athletic and talented and have arm reach and all that,” Whitworth said. “You’ve got to have core strength and power and the ability to sit on people because, really, it’s not as much about keeping up with these people on their feet as being able to stop their power first. I think that’s one of those things Ced will tell you that’s his main goal – to develop some of that.” \nThe big question now is whether Whitworth will be around to see whether Ogbuehi and the Bengals take that next step in 2017. \nAlex Marvez can be heard from 7-11 p.m. ET Tuesday through Thursday on SiriusXM NFL Radio.
