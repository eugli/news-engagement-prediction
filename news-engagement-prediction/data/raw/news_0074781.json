Perhaps, the launch of Nokia 3310 has been the most anticipated one in the history of any phone, smart or not. \nFinnish company HMD Global revived the Nokia 3310 at the Mobile World Congress 2017 (MWC 2017) on Sunday night along with Nokia 3, 5 and 6 Android phones.While the Nokia 3310 of the past was known for its sturdiness and build, the revamped avatar is an upgrade in terms of looks and features. Heck! Even the popular Snake game makes a comeback in a refurbished version.The new Nokia 3310 is a feature phone that banks on 2.5G connectivity for data and runs S30+ operating system. Though the S30+ OS allows for web browsing, it is limited in terms of apps â€“ which is understandable given Nokia's aim to revive a bare-basic phone brand. It has 2.4-inch screen and a keypad resembling the iconic model phased out in 2005.One of the major upgrades to the new Nokia 3310 is a 2 megapixel camera. Nokia said the phone will provide a 22-hour talktime and nearly a month's standby time. Also, Nokia will offer single- and dual-SIM variants of the new 3310. \nNokia 3310 is priced at EUR 49.
