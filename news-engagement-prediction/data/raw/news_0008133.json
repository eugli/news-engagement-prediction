Mr Trump's pick will be announced from the Oval Office at 20:00 Washington time The two in the running \nThe 49-year-old Neil Gorsuch is the youngest of the two being considered. He lives in Colorado where he has served on the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals since 2006. He is an \"originalist\", meaning he believes that the US Constitution should be followed as the Founding Fathers intended. \nPhiladelphia-based judge Thomas Hardiman, 51, has served since 2007 on the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals - a court where the president's sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, is also on the bench. He was the first person in his family to go to college and supported himself in law school by driving a taxi. Mr Hardiman has supported gun rights and police search powers. Media caption The Supreme Court has been without a full bench for almost a full year. Why is it so important? \nThe highest court in the US is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. \nIt hears fewer than 100 cases a year and the key announcements are made in June. Each of the nine justices serves a lifetime appointment after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. \nThe court already has cases this term on the rights of transgender students, gerrymandered voting districts and on the Texas death penalty determination. \nIt is also likely the court will hear cases on voter rights, abortion, racial bias in policing and US immigration policy, and possibly on Mr Trump's controversial executive order banning refugees. \nOn the campaign trail, the Supreme Court vacancy was a key factor in persuading many wavering Republicans to back Mr Trump, says BBC North America reporter Rajini Vaidyanathan.   In 2015 the court legalised gay marriage in all 50 states \nCan Democrats block the nomin ation ? \nThe failure to confirm Mr Obama's selection has left Democrats embittered, claiming that their nominee had been \"stolen\", and many have vowed to use similar tactics to block Mr Trump's pick. \nEven if the nominee makes it through the Senate Judiciary Committee, he will still face challenges when the entire Senate convenes for a final vote. \nDemocrats may seek to prevent that second vote, by filibustering in order to deny Mr Trump the 60-vote threshold needed to bring the nomination to the floor. \nWith Republicans only holding 52 Senate seats, they may have to change Senate rules in order to approve Mr Trump's nominee.
