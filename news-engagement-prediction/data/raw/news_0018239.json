Nicki Minaj Advertisement \nShe may be Your Minajesty, but this 34-year-old doesn’t have any Grammy gold in her crown, despite 10 nominations in years past.

Katy Perry Advertisement \nThe Academy has been “Hot n Cold” with this 32-year-old pop star, granting her 13 nominations but 0 wins.

Nas Advertisement \nDespite racking up 11 Grammy nominations and being ranked as the fifth greatest MC and the second-best lyricist of all time , this 43-year-old Illmatic rapper has yet to take home the big prize. 4. Journey 4. Journey Advertisement \nWe wish we could tell you “Don’t Stop Believin’”... but it might be time to stop believing.

This 50-year-old has been named the CMA Female Vocalist of the Year four times, but none of her 14 Grammy nominations has resulted in a win. 8. Future 8. Future Advertisement \nThis Atlanta-based rapper, 32, is approaching the million sales mark between his four studio albums. However, his one and only Grammy nomination came this year — and not even for his album but for his featured role on Drake’s Views . 9. Bjork 9. Bjork Advertisement \nNo one else on this list has been so groundbreaking as to earn a Museum of Modern Art retrospective, but this Icelandic 51-year-old still doesn’t have a Grammy, despite 14 nominations so far. 10. Brian McKnight 10. Brian McKnight Advertisement \nThis 47-year-old R&B star boasts 12 studio albums, 3 of which achieved Platinum status, but still has no Grammy.
