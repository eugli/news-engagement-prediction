This is not merely a federal mandate, but a moral obligation no individual, school, district or state can abdicate. At my direction, the Department’s Office for Civil Rights remains committed to investigating all claims of discrimination, bullying and harassment against those who are most vulnerable in our schools. \nThe guidance issued by the previous administration has given rise to several legal questions. As a result, a federal court in August 2016 issued a nationwide injunction barring the Department from enforcing a portion of its application. Since that time, the Department has not enforced that part of the guidance, thus there is no immediate impact to students by rescinding this guidance. \nThis is an issue best solved at the state and local level. Schools, communities, and families can find – and in many cases have found – solutions that protect all students. \nI have dedicated my career to advocating for and fighting on behalf of students, and as Secretary of Education, I consider protecting all students, including LGBTQ students, not only a key priority for the Department, but for every school in America. \nWe owe all students a commitment to ensure they have access to a learning environment that is free of discrimination, bullying and harassment. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:37:00.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
