John Kennedy and Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers earlier this season \nAnd in the recent 6-0 Scottish Cup fifth-round win over Inverness CT, Iain Vigurs was booked after a two-footed challenge on Celtic winger Scott Sinclair. \nRodgers fears one of his players will be seriously injured, and he would be happy to voice concerns on the matters by speaking to SFA Head of Referees John Fleming. \nThe Hoops manager is alarmed a Scottish player could have his career ended prematurely in the manner of John Kennedy, who is now a defensive coach at the club. \nKennedy, who was making his Scotland debut in 2004 against Romania at the age of 20, was caught by a late knee-high challenge from Ionel Ganea, and never fully recovered before retiring from the game five years later. Celtic defender Kieran Tierney was able to continue despite a tackle to his knee \n\"I would like them to have a sense of just a wee bit of protection for our players,\" Rodgers said, who asked about his thoughts on Scottish match officials. \n\"I see the tackle on Kieran Tierney, which I didn't get a chance to see last week straight after the game, I didn't see it. But I've watched the replay afterwards, and it was a horrendous challenge. \n\"Now this is a kid who is coming through, he's 19-years-of-age, one of the great prospects of Scottish football. I've a boy who is a brilliant coach on my staff, John Kennedy, who was also a brilliant prospect, who in one challenge lost his career. \n\"I don't really want that to happen to any of my players or any player for that fact, whether he's from Celtic, Rangers, Hearts, Hibs, wherever.\" Also See: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:21:39.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
