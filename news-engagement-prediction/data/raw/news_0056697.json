Each regiment has up to 10 launchers. \nThe rising number of new weapons has raised demands for new personnel. Shoigu said the military currently needs 1,300 more pilots and will recruit them by 2018. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, right, in March 2016. (Mikhail Klimentyev/AP) \nA severe money crunch after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union left the military in tatters, with most of its planes grounded and ships left rusting at harbor for lack of funds. As part of President Vladimir Putin’s military reforms, the armed forces have received new weapons and now engage in regular large-scale drills. \nRussia has used its revived military capability in Syria, where it has launched an air campaign in support of Syrian President Bashar Assad and used the conflict to test its new weapons for the first time in combat. \nThe weapons modernization effort has seen the 1-million Russian military narrow the technological gap in some areas where Russia had fallen behind the West, such as long-range conventional weapons, communications and drone technologies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:13:02.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
