The Ivey’s Hotel expects to open for its first guests by the end of March. 22 photos The 42-room, boutique Ivey's Hotel is located on the second floor of the historic Ivey's… more Over the last two years, MRK Property Development has worked to transform the second floor of 127 N. Tryon into a 42-room boutique hotel. “You want that intimate environment. That super luxurious feel,” says Jason Zarco , managing director for MRK. “There’s a yearning for that.” This is the third property for MRK. It also operates The Marlin Hotel in Miami Beach, Fla., and The Windsor Boutique Hotel in Asheville. The Ivey’s Hotel will encompass roughly 38,000 square feet — mainly on the second floor of that six-story historic building. That space was previously used for retail. There’s also a hotel lobby, atrium, conference space and a bar-and-lounge area on the first floor. Another 5,000-square-foot space is slated to become an upscale dining concept, with the tenant still to be named. The investment to transform that space runs in the “double-digit millions,” Zarco says. The building, which dates to 1924, served as Ivey’s department store for much of its history. “There’s nothing else like it in the Charlotte market,” says John Maly , general manager. Each room’s decor fuses vintage pieces with contemporary flair — and adds a touch of Parisian Glam. “We want them to be able to tell a story,” says Brett Krueger , principal and vice president of MRK. “I mix vintage items with boutique. When we started the concept, I couldn’t believe how well they went together.” Think vintage binoculars, clocks or toy planes as accents. Antique watch faces have been transformed into custom framed art. Magazine pages showcasing Parisian couture in the 1920s and 1930s grace the walls, as do 100-plus-year-old maps of the city. Then there’s the 400-year-old French oak floors, exposed brick, glass to flood the space with light and the grand staircase with scrolling, wrought-iron railings. Detailed molding and woodwork add character to the hallways and doors. Tapestry in each room sets the tone for the remaining decor. Light fixtures add a touch of sparkle, and extras such as claw-foot tubs highlight the luxury feel. “You won’t find it anywhere else,” Maly says. Room options will include city view, superior atrium and balcony suites that overlook Tryon Street. The executive suites clock in at roughly 800 square feet.
