Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah stepped up security to ensure that Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan's visit to Mangaluru went off without any hitch despite RSS threats. Print \nWith some help from from his Karnataka counterpart and Congress leader K Siddaramaiah, Kerala Chief Minister leader Pinarayi Vijayan defied threats from the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and its outfits allied with in Mangaluru on Saturday. \nThe Sangh organisations had vowed to block Vijayan from entering Karnataka to protest the killings of Bharatiya Janata Party and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh workers in Kannur district in Kerala, which has been a hotbed of political violence between the saffron groups and Communist Party of India (Marxist) for decades. Vijayan, a CPI(M) politburo member, hails from Kannur and groups part of the Sangh Parivar have alleged that he is responsible for the killings of BJP and RSS workers in his home turf. Helping hand \nIt would not have been possible for Vijayan to visit the city without the support of the Siddaramaiah government. \nAhead of Vijayan’s visit, Sangh Parivar activists had held protests and incidents of violence were reported in Mangaluru on Friday. Sangh Parivar workers also called for a bandh in Dakshin Kannada district (of which Mangaluru is the headquarters) and the situation remained tense even as the Kerala Chief Minister entered the city, where he was to address a rally. \nHowever, the state government on Friday imposed prohibitory orders under section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which prohibits the assembly of a large group of people, for 48 hours, deployed around 4,000 police personnel in the city and increased surveillance. It is learnt that the Sangh Parivar leadership was forced to withdraw the protest in view of the government’s tough stand. \nVijayan expressed his gratitude to the Karnataka government while addressing the Coastal Communal Harmony Rally, organised by the CPI(M), at the city’s Nehru Maidan in the evening. “I appreciate the state government for its efforts to ensure my safety,” he said. “The government has shown the best way to take on the RSS.” \nEarlier in the day, Vijayan laid the foundation stone for the office of Kannada newspaper Vartha Bharathi , and inaugurated the AKG Beedi Workers’ Co-operative Hospital. The prohibitory orders had been relaxed in these areas. Image: Facebook/CPIM-Karnataka Prestige issue \nThe Mangaluru visit became a prestige issue for Vijayan, who was forced to skip an event hosted by Malayali organisations in Bhopal in December, after Sangh Parivar activists held a protest outside the venue to oppose the violence in Kannur. \nDrawing inspiration from their success in Bhopal, leaders of the saffron groups decided to hold similar protests against CPI(M) cadres all over the country. Vijayan knew that backing out from the Mangaluru event would further embolden Sangh Parivar. \n“Those who threatened me should understand that Pinarayi Vijayan had a long political experience,” Vijayan said during his address at Nehru Maidan on Saturday. “I know RSS and its devious methods very well. I have been defying your threats since I entered student politics. You can ask your elders in RSS to know more about me. You couldn’t touch me at that time. What are you going to do now?” \nHe also tried to put up a brave face over the Bhopal incident. “I had skipped the Bhopal event following instructions from the Madhya Pradesh police,” he said. “As a chief minister I had to follow their directives. Had I been not a chief minister, I would have attended the function. I am not worried about your threats.” Image: Facebook/CPIM-Karnataka Political significance \nVijayan’s Mangaluru visit also saw the Congress and CPI(M), otherwise ideologically different, to join hands to counter the threat from Sangh Parivar. This might pave the way for a similar coming together in Kerala, where the Sangh is gaining ground . \nVijayan’s visit could also embolden the Siddaramaiah government to act tough on the fringe rightwing groups in Karnataka. \nMeanwhile, communist party leaders claimed that the success of the communal harmony rally showed people’s faith in CPI (M) and secular parties. “The rally aimed at finding peace in the South Karnataka districts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi and Uttara Kannada, which have been witnessing communal clashes for several years,” said Muneer Katipalla, state president of Democratic Youth Federation of India, the youth wing of the CPI (M). “The participation of thousands of people in the rally showed that they hated Sangh Parivar’s communal politics.” We welcome your comments at Some of the worst decisions made in history From the boardroom to the battlefield, bad decisions have been a recipe for disaster Published Feb 20, 2017. Print \nOn New Year’s Day, 1962, Dick Rowe, the official talent scout for Decca Records, went to office, little realising that this was to become one of the most notorious days in music history. He and producer Mike Smith had to audition bands and decide if any were good enough to be signed on to the record label. At 11:00 am, either Rowe or Smith, history is not sure who, listened a group of 4 boys who had driven for over 10 hours through a snowstorm from Liverpool, play 15 songs. After a long day spent listening to other bands, the Rowe-Smith duo signed on a local group that would be more cost effective. The band they rejected went on to become one of the greatest acts in musical history – The Beatles. However, in 1962, they were allegedly dismissed with the statement “Guitar groups are on the way out”. Source: Wikimedia Commons \nDecca’s decision is a classic example of deciding based on biases and poor information. History is full of examples of poor decisions that have had far reaching and often disastrous consequences. \nIn the world of business, where decisions are usually made after much analysis, bad decisions have wiped out successful giants. Take the example of Kodak – a company that made a devastating wrong decision despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Everyone knows that Kodak couldn’t survive as digital photography replaced film. What is so ironic that Alanis Morissette could have sung about it, is that the digital camera was first invented by an engineer at Kodak as early as 1975. In 1981, an extensive study commissioned by Kodak showed that digital was likely to replace Kodak’s film camera business in about 10 years. Astonishingly, Kodak did not use this time to capitalise on their invention of digital cameras – rather they focused on making their film cameras even better. In 1996, they released a combined camera – the Advantix, which let users preview their shots digitally to decide which ones to print. Quite understandably, no one wanted to spend on printing when they could view, store and share photos digitally. The Advantix failed, but the company’s unwillingness to shift focus to digital technology continued. Kodak went from a 90% market share in US camera sales in 1976 to less than 10% in 2012, when it filed for bankruptcy. It sold off many of its biggest businesses and patents and is now a shell of its former self.

However, Britain remained out of his grasp and so, he imposed a trade blockade against the island nation. But the Russia’s Czar Alexander I refused to comply due to its effect on Russian trade. To teach the Russians a lesson, Napolean assembled his Grand Armée – one of the largest forces to ever march on war. Estimates put it between 450,000 to 680,000 soldiers. Napoleon had been so successful because his army could live off the land i.e. forage and scavenge extensively to survive. This was successful in agriculture-rich and densely populated central Europe. The vast, barren lands of Russia were a different story altogether. The Russian army kept retreating further and further inland burning crops, cities and other resources in their wake to keep these from falling into French hands. A game of cat and mouse ensued with the French losing soldiers to disease, starvation and exhaustion. The first standoff between armies was the bloody Battle of Borodino which resulted in almost 70,000 casualties. Seven days later Napoleon marched into a Moscow that was a mere shell, burned and stripped of any supplies. No Russian delegation came to formally surrender. Faced with no provisions, diminished troops and a Russian force that refused to play by the rules, Napolean began the long retreat, back to France. His miseries hadn’t ended - his troops were attacked by fresh Russian forces and had to deal with the onset of an early winter. According to some, only 22,000 French troops made it back to France after the disastrous campaign.

The stakes were extremely high – Pakistan had never won a major cricket tournament, the atmosphere at the Sharjah stadium was electric, the India-Pakistan rivalry at its height. Pakistan had one wicket in hand, with four runs required off one ball. And then the unthinkable happened – Chetan Sharma decided to bowl a Yorker. This is an extremely difficult ball to bowl, many of the best bowlers shy away from it especially in high pressure situations. A badly timed Yorker can morph into a full toss ball that can be easily played by the batsman. For Sharma who was then just 18 years old, this was an ambitious plan that went wrong. The ball emerged as a low full toss which Miandad smashed for a six, taking Pakistan to victory. Almost 30 years later, this ball is still the first thing Chetan Sharma is asked about when anyone meets him. \nSo, what leads to bad decisions? While these examples show the role of personal biases, inertia, imperfect information and overconfidence, bad advice can also lead to bad decisions. One of the worst things you can do when making an important decision is to make it on instinct or merely on someone’s suggestion, without arming yourself with the right information.
