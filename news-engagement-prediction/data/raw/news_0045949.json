I know who they are and how they think. In the national press, it is at least ten to one liberal over conservative.\" \nWatch more above, and let us know what you think in the comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T03:56:11.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
