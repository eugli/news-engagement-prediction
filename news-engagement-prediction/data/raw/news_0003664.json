Although, Talia's mother, Farra Rosko, was concerned for Miles’ welfare and wanted to make sure the 22-year-old knew what she was signing up for. \n“The testing was a long process but through it all I knew I wanted to donate. As long as they told me I was a match, I was ready to donate,” Miles said. \nIn early January, Miles donated part of her liver at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania after the medically team determined she was a match with Talia. \nBoth Miles and Talia made speedy recoveries. Miles was in the hospital for five days and Talia was only in for nine. \n“We’ve both been doing great,” said Miles. “Talia has been off all her medicine, except for her anti-rejection medicine, since she’s been home and […] she’s walking around better than she was before the surgery […] She’s amazing.” \n\"I didn't know that [Miles] was this selfless I've come to find out that this is who she is,\" said Farra speaking to  . \"She really is an angel on earth; I know that sounds silly, but she really is.\" \nWith files from   Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:24:06.478+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
