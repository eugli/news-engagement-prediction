Police say the vehicle, which was parked at the garage on Wednesday morning, spent the whole day there without mechanics inspecting its cargo. \nThe driver who parked it, locals say, left immediately, without speaking to anyone. \nHEAD INJURIES At around 7pm, curious mechanics operating at the garage peeped through the windows of the Toyota Succeed, which resembles a Probox, only to find the bodies. \"The driver parked the car and left without talking to anyone,\" Kikuyu police chief Joseph Ongaya to the Nation on Thursday. \n\"The mechanics did not see anything usual, until in the evening when they decided to check on it after realising that it (the vehicle) had been at their place of work for so long.\" \nThe bodies, Ongaya said, had head injuries that they suspected were caused by blunt objects. \nNO IDs No identity documents were found on the corpses, which have been taken to City Mortuary in Nairobi. Police suspect the four may have been murdered elsewhere and the bodies ferried to the area. \nMr Ongaya said police were hunting for the driver who abandoned the vehicle. Also wanted is the owner of the vehicle, whose identity police are likely to get from the Kenya Revenue Authority.
