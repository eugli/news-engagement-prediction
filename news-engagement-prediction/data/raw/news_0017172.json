Source: News Corp Australia \nThe 36-year-old is a former Wallabies captain, has 112 Test caps to his name, two Super Rugby titles and was just recently named in the Japan Top League’s team of the season which followed his players’ player award in the Aviva Premiership. \nHe even helped undefeated England coach Eddie Jones at the start of his coaching reign, appearing at England training sessions working, in particular, with the nation’s backrowers. \nBut despite his impressive resume, Smith isn’t taking his position in the side for granted. \n“My expectations are to play within this team and perform well within this team,” Smith told foxsports.com.au. \n“First and foremost I’m a rugby player and I need to perform within this team and earn the right to be within the squad. \n“But no, I haven’t spoken about playing time. As a rugby player you want to be playing every match.” A photo posted by David Pocock (@davidpocock) on Jan 29, 2017 at 12:59am PST \nSmith’s arrival at the club comes just a week after helping Suntory Sungoliath, together with Reds teammate Hendrik Tui, to the All-Japan Championship Final, as they defeated Panasonic Wild Knights 15-10. \nHe also showed up David Pocock in the process, making a crucial pilfer late in the match to help seal the club’s 17th straight win. \nDespite not having a break for more than a year, Smith said that he is excited to be returning to Super Rugby and said that the hardest challenge at the moment is surviving the hot Brisbane conditions after playing through the Japanese winter. \n“I feel good,” Smith said. \n“Mentally I’m really excited about the season ahead. I always knew that I was coming back to play rugby here with the Reds, so it hasn’t been much of a mental effort in readjusting and focusing on this competition. \n“I’ve just come off the back of a really successful season with Suntory in Japan. \n“Pretty confident with the way I played throughout that time over there and I’ve parked all that, and now the focus is with the Reds. \n“I had my first session here at the Reds this morning. In this heat it’s quite difficult, but I’m really enjoying it so far.” George Smith of the Wallabies in action during the Tri Nations in 2005. Source: FOX SPORTS \nAfter three years of disappointment and frustration, 2017 promises plenty for Reds fans. \nAs well as Smith, first-year head coach Nick Stiles, who took over as co-head coach together with Matt O’Connor after Richard Graham’s early-season sacking, has put together the best list of players in Australia’s conference, signing Wallabies captain Stephen Moore from the Brumbies, and bringing back Leroy Houston and Higginbotham. \nBut it’s not just the new additions that will add plenty to the squad, with Wallabies Kane Douglas, James Slipper and Karmichael Hunt set to start the season after missing the majority of 2016. \nSmith sees potential in the group, but is experienced enough to know that promise doesn’t win you matches. \n“Look I’m very excited about the roster, the staff that the Queensland management have put together is great,” Smith said. \n“Obviously we have some very good players within the squad. \n“I’ve been a part of squads that have been fantastic but haven’t fulfilled what their aim has been at the start of the year, so it’s up to the players to listen and take on board what the coaches are saying and directing. \n“But ultimately it’s the players that need to be doing the job on the training field and in games. \n“Do I have a prediction for the end of the season? No I don’t. But I do expect good things from the Reds.” Queensland Reds coach Nick Stiles confronts the media at Ballymore.
