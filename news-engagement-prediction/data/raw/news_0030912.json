Bachelor Richie Strahan refused to give Keira a rose. Source: Channel 10 \nSince appearing on The Bachelor , 30-year old Keira has made no secret of the fact she’d like to be on reality television programs. \nAnd, tonight she’s going to get exactly what she wanted, heading to the jungle to join the 12 other celebrities already in camp. \n“We’ll see how people respond to my outspoken ways,” she said in a Twitter video.

Could be the biceps, could be the rig,” she added. \nIf you’re worried Keira isn’t going to bring the drama like she did on The Bachelor, the reality star revealed she won’t disappoint. \n“I’m super excited about getting in the jungle because I can’t wait to get under their skin,” she said. \n“Ha ha just joking, not really,” she added. \nI’m A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here airs tonight at 7pm on Network Ten.
