For example, at this elite private institution, while students pay for 18 credits per semester, many actually take only 16, officials said, so the university will increase the number of two-credit courses it offers. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story It will also allow many students to transfer in up to eight credits from other schools, like local community colleges where they can take inexpensive classes over the summer — in the past, this has been allowed on a case-by-case basis. In addition, the university has trained advisers to help students create schedules that will get them to their three-year goal. But some who study education wonder what students will miss if they rush through their undergraduate years, and they worry about who will feel pressure to make those sacrifices.

Credit Benjamin Norman for The New York Times Sara Goldrick-Rab , a professor of higher education policy at Temple University, said that shaving time off college as a way to make it more affordable could raise some troubling questions. In college, she said, there is academic learning, but there are also important experiences outside the classroom, like the social networks students build, study abroad programs and internships — assuming students do not have to hold down jobs that crowd out those things in the first place. While some students can get what they need academically in three years, Dr. Goldrick-Rab said, packing in all those credits can take away from the time they can spend on other things. “We agree that the price of college is a problem,” she said. But she questioned whether the solution was “to essentially have less college, or less time in college.” “It’s interesting,” she said of accelerated schedules, “but it worries me.” Students have long found ways to make it through school in three or three and a half years, but there is increasing momentum to streamline the process in the face of ballooning outrage over college costs and student debt. Gov. John Kasich , Republican of Ohio, pushed to make it easier for students in his state to graduate from public colleges early by allowing more credits from high school or technical programs. Gov. Scott Walker, Republican of Wisconsin, included in his budget proposal this month that schools in the University of Wisconsin system should create a three-year degree for 60 percent of its programs by the summer of 2020. Individual schools, like Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind., which is also a state school, have also begun experimenting with three-year degree options. But they are not always popular. As of this May, Perdue expects 14 students to have graduated in three and a half years or less, since the program was announced in 2014. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “So far, we haven’t had a lot of takers,” said Josh Boyd, director of undergraduate studies in the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue. “When we speak to parents, they tend to be more excited about it than the students.” Photo Ashley Korkeakoski-Sears, an N.Y.U.

Ashley Korkeakoski-Sears, an N.Y.U. English major who is on track to graduate this May after just three years, said that she did not regret speeding through. While she had to skip some fun classes, like hip-hop dance, she has had time for plenty of experiences. She interned at the International Rescue Committee, she has worked as an office assistant and an executive assistant, and she studied abroad in Madrid. Ms. Korkeakoski-Sears said she decided to hustle through to save money. She expected to receive less financial aid her senior year because her mother planned to go back to work.
