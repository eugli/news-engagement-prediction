(Reuters) \nChina’s installed photovoltaic (PV) capacity more than doubled last year, turning the country into the world’s biggest producer of solar energy by capacity, the National Energy Administration (NEA) said on Saturday. \nInstalled PV capacity rose to 77.42 gigawatts at the end of 2016, with the addition of 34.54 gigawatts over the course of the year, data from the energy agency showed. \nShandong, Xinjiang, Henan were among the provinces that saw the most capacity increase, while Xinjiang, Gansu, Qinghai and Inner Mongolia had the greatest overall capacity at the end of last year, according to the data. \nChina will add more than 110 gigawatts of capacity in the 2016-2020 period, according to the NEA’s solar power development plan. \nSolar plants generated 66.2 billion kilowatt-hours of power last year, accounting for 1 percent of China’s total power generation, the NEA said. \nThe country aims to boost the mix of non-fossil fuel generated power to 20 percent by 2030 from 11 percent today. \nYou may also like to watch this video \nChina plans to plough 2.5 trillion yuan ($364 billion) into renewable power generation by 2020.
