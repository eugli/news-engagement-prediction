Adi Joseph , USA TODAY Sports 6:45 p.m. ET Feb. 6, 2017 \nDavid Beaty has won two games in two years as Kansas head coach. (Photo: Ray Carlin-USA TODAY Sports) \nKansas Jayhawks football, by the numbers: \n1 - the most Big 12 Conference victories that they have managed in any single season in the 2010s 2 - the total number of wins in two seasons under current head coach David Beaty 4 - head coaches since Mark Mangino was fired for alleged misconduct toward campus staff 5 - the total number of teams with better Class of 2018 recruiting classes than the Jayhawks, according to Rivals \nWait, what? — Blake Schuster (@Schustee) February 6, 2017 \nBeaty secured more commitments from four-star recruits this year than he has career victories as a head coach. The 2-22 coach isn't cheating - well, any NCAA coach might be cheating, so we shouldn't be too definitive there - but rather seeing an opportunity and grasping it. \nFrom a USA TODAY High School Sports look at KU's recruiting efforts : \nThe transition from Louisiana and Texas to Kansas is a direct credit to Beatty and his roots. The third-year head coach arrived in Lawrence after a career as a high school coach in Texas . Still, it has taken Beatty a few years to reach the cream of the Southern crop, but this group has been helped by the addition to the coaching staff of running backs coach Tony Hull, who spent the last eight years as head coach at Warren Easton High in New Orleans. \nLouisiana is the real key to the recruiting class. All six players with four- and three-star grades from Rivals in the class are from Louisiana. \nCorione Harris, ranked 60th nationally, is the star of the class. He's a 6-1 cornerback from New Orleans who committed to Kansas while being targeted by most of the Southeastern Conference, according to Rivals . \n//www.hudl.com/embed/video/3/4662078/582239c7bd75203480a2495b \nNow, it's important to note that much can change between now and 2018 signing day, when these players actually lock into commitments. Kansas could have another awful season that causes these guys to reconsider, or Hull could leave and take them with him. \nFor now, though, Rock Chalk Nation finally has a reason to pay attention to football again.
