Police have been informed,\" a spokesman told the Sun Sport. \nBritish media also reported that Palace's assistant head groundsman Dean Waters had condemned the vandals and revealed their error. \n\"40,000 pounds worth of damage on our coach thinking it was the Boro coach. Nice one! #cpfc,\" Waters tweeted, before changing his privacy settings so that the post was no longer available to the public. \n(Reporting by Shravanth Vijayakumar in Bengaluru) - Reuters/am", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:58:57.995+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
