In a statement, the rep said Bey, who‚Äôs pregnant with twins, was just ‚Äúfollowing the advice of her doctors to keep a less rigorous schedule in the coming months.‚Äù \nBeyonc√© announced her pregnancy about a month after the Coachella lineup was unveiled, leading many to speculate whether she‚Äôd be able to grace the festival with her presence. \nThere is a silver lining though ‚Äï Bey will headline the 2018 festival. There‚Äôs been no news yet about who will take her place (let‚Äôs be real, no one can) this year, though. \nThe Coachella Twitter account retweeted AP‚Äôs story and shared the news on its official Facebook page, telling fans, ‚ÄúStay tuned for more information.‚Äù \nNaturally, folks aren‚Äôt too happy about the announcement.
