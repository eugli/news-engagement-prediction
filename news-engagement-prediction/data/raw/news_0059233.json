(Photo: PTI) Pune: Australian opener Matt Renshaw , who retired hurt in the morning session on first day of the opening Test against India, on Thursday revealed that he had to use the bathroom and that's the reason he retired ill mid-way through his innings.\nRenshaw, on 36 with around 15 minutes before the lunch break in Pune, left the field when David Warner was dismissed, much to the confusion of his incoming skipper Steve Smith, viewers and crowd.\nHowever, the left-handed opener returned later in the day to complete his half century before being dismissed by ace Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin for 68.\n\"It came pretty suddenly, probably about five or ten minutes before Davey [David Warner] got out, I asked Richard [Kettleborough] how long there was till Lunch, and he told me half an hour. I was struggling a bit then,\" Renshaw said at the press conference at the end of the day's play.\n\"It wasn't an ideal situation to be in. It was tough. I wasn't sure of the ruling. I didn't know you could retire ill, so thought I'll just get out there and make sure I batted till lunch. It wasn't an ideal situation so I just had to make do.\"\nRevealing that Smith wasn't too impressed when he first heard of what was happening, the 20-year-old said: \"He wasn't too thrilled about it, but he understands that when you need to go to the toilet, you've got to go to the toilet. It wasn't an ideal scenario, as I said, but its life, pretty much.\"\n\"He didn't really understand what was going on at the start. I sort of just ran past him, he didn't really comprehend what was going on. I told him I needed the toilet.\"\n\"Obviously, we'd just lost a wicket so there would be two new batsmen out there but as I said, it's a hard scenario to be in and he understood. We've had a chat now and we're all good,\" he added.\nAustralia were rescued by a quick-fire fifty from Mitchell Starc that pushed them to 256/9 at the close of day's play of the opening Test of the four-match series against India being played at the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T11:00:27.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
