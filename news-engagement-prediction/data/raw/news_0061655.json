Other people are amazing, but that's my family! Those are my people.\" — Mahershala Ali ( Moonlight ), shown sitting with, from left, his castmates Janelle Monae , Andre Holland and Trevante Rhodes \nB. \"It's perfect for me 'cause I sit next to my best friend Busy, so I wouldn't change a thing.\"— Michelle Williams ( Manchester by the Sea ), shown sitting next to Busy Philipps \nC. \"My son, Henry, is going with me, so I'm happy with that. I don't know who the hell else will be there. If I could pick someone? I'd be really happy to be sitting next to Meryl Streep. That would be wonderful. Meryl on one side and Henry on the other, I think we'd have a good time.\"— Viggo Mortensen ( Captain Fantastic ), shown sitting behind Meryl Streep ( Florence Foster Jenkins ) \nD. \"I love Isabelle Huppert. I got to kiss her hand in Paris recently, so I'd bow down and kiss her hand.\"— Nicole Kidman ( Lion ), shown sitting next to Isabelle Huppert ( Elle ) \nE. Ruth Negga ( Loving ) chooses Michael Shannon ( Nocturnal Animals ) \nF. \"I'm going to go with my wife, Kate. But I don't know who else I'd choose, there's a lot of interesting people there. It'd be cool to sit next to Jack Nicholson, though I don't know if he goes anymore.\"— Michael Shannon ( Nocturnal Animals ), shown sitting next to wife Kate Arrington \nG. \"Other than my wife? ( Laughs. ) My mom wore me out the year I won for Glory . She's 92 now, bless her heart. We went to the Governors Ball and stayed, I guess, too long. My mother was like, 'Those flower arrangements, they're just gonna leave those?' I walked out with a flower arrangement and an Oscar! Only a mother. It might be interesting to sit next to Damien Chazelle and Barry Jenkins and hear what they have to say because it's newer for them.\"— Denzel Washington ( Fences star and director) shown sitting with wife Pauletta Washington, Damien Chazelle ( La La Land director)and Barry Jenkins ( Moonlight director) \nH. \"Meryl Streep. I was lucky enough to be beside her at the SAG Awards, and she fixed my bow tie before the show started. She saved me from a fashion disaster. My bow tie was in the most vulnerable state. It was squirrelly.\"— Ryan Gosling ( La La Land ) shown sitting next to Meryl Streep ( Florence Foster Jenkins ) \nI. \"I'd love to be near Viola and Emma because it's a big family affair [all three starred in 2011 nominee The Help ]. And I'd want to be in the front row. The thought of having to walk up to the podium is nerve-racking for women because there are no railings and you are in high-heeled shoes and have to hold the bottom of your skirt. No one wants to face-plant with a billion viewers watching like poor Jennifer Lawrence did.\"— Octavia Spencer ( Hidden Figures ) shown sitting between Emma Stone ( La La Land ) and Viola Davis ( Fences ) \nJ. \"I would love to sit with Oprah Winfrey. My mom is coming with me. She's the hugest fan ever, and it's her dream to meet her. I met Oprah at an event in London, and I thought about calling my mom and saying, 'Just get in the car and get over here!' She is so calm and collected, but she will lose it while meeting Oprah. I want to see that moment!\"— Naomie Harris ( Moonlight ) shown sitting next to Oprah Winfrey ( 13th producer) \n\"I'd love to be between Jeff Bridges and Denzel, but I'd be too intimidated to talk to either. I would be staring forward, freaking out in my head, too shy to introduce myself and shake their hand.\"— Shawn Levy ( Arrival producer) \n\"Damien Chazelle and his editor, Tom Cross . They're brilliant.\"— Todd Black ( Fences producer) \n\"I would like to sit in between Meryl Streep, because she looks like she's always having a good time, and Bradley Cooper , if he is going to be there, because he is one of the handsomest men on the planet and a good egg.\"— Donna Gigliotti ( Hidden Figures producer) \nThis story first appeared in the Feb. 24 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
