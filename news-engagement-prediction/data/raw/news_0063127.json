That's a big snake,\" A shocked onlooker says. \nAnother man helps Oli put the snake into a bag. \nOli's father, Chazza Wardrope, gives his son a congratulatory handshake and expresses his pride. \n\"That's my boy. Been wrangling snakes since he was five.\" Â© Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T14:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:28:08.116+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
