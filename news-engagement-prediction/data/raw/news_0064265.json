(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) (Photo: The Associated Press) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSAN DIEGO (AP) â€” Josh Perkins and Jordan Mathews scored 15 points apiece, and Johnathan Williams had 14 points and 19 rebounds for No. 1 Gonzaga, which overwhelmed San Diego 96-38 on Thursday night to improve to 29-0 and clinch the West Coast Conference title. \nThe 58-point victory margin was the biggest of the season for Gonzaga, which also has won games by 47, 46 and 39 points. \nAnd it was merely the latest laugher for Gonzaga (17-0 WCC), the only unbeaten team in Division I. It has won all 17 conference games by double digits. \nNigel Williams-Goss scored 14 points and Zach Collins had 12 for Gonzaga. \nOlin Carter III scored 15 for USD (12-17, 5-12), which has lost six straight and 39 of its last 42 games to Gonzaga. \nGonzaga so dominated that it jumped to an 11-0 lead while USD missed its first 10 shots, five of them 3-pointers. Juwan Gray finally ended the drought with a 3-pointer some 6 1/2 minutes in. \nAll those missed USD shots led to easy rebounds for the Bulldogs, who finished with 51 to USD's 20. \nHelpless against Gonzaga's strong inside game, the Toreros were mostly relegated to tossing up 3s, and air-balling a handful. \nIt was so bad for USD that Cameron Neubauer air-balled a layup. Apparently thinking it was going to get blocked, he short-armed it and missed badly. \nBIG PICTURE \nGonzaga: The Zags have 21 straight games by double digits. \nSan Diego: While the margin was worse, at least the Toreros scored more points than they did in losing 71-27 to then-No. 18 Saint Mary's, the lowest total in school history. \nUP NEXT \nGonzaga finishes the regular season at home against BYU on Saturday night. \nSan Diego finishes against Portland at home Saturday night. \n___ \nMore AP college basketball: www.collegebasketball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
