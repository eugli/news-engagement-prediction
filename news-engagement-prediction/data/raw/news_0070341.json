Eating Doritos and watching Buffy ? Same. \nBut not Australia’s Oli Wardrope. Instead, he’s pulling live, massive snakes out of the bottom of cars. Before school, even. \nQueensland man, Yogi McDougall, posted the video to Facebook Friday, writing “All part of the job. I love having apprentices.” \nThe video shows young Wardrope wrestling with half of a large carpet python, while the other half grips stubbornly to the underside of the vehicle. \n“Oh, he’s coming out now … he’s loosened up now,” Wardrope says. “I’ve got his head, I’ve got his head, I’ve got his head!” \nThe ridiculously brave teen then places the (non-venomous but damn strong and kind of bite-y) snake into a bag, while the guy holding it swears with joy. \nOli’s dad, Chazza Wardrope summed it up nicely on Facebook, saying “That’s my boy! Been wrangling snakes since he was five!” \nWhat a legend. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T08:34:35.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
