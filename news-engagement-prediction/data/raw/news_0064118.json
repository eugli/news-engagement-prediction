It seems that spiritual, art-loving AthenaX has beef with at least three or four other members of the cast. Her main rival: Bondi queen Victoria. \nAthena’s smarting about what she sees as poor treatment by her castmates — and she wants the world to know. \n“You had a bully mentality, darling. You were the mean girls, and you ARE the mean girls. \nI’m also talking about behind the scenes. Seriously, I found some of you girls very rude and very hypocritical,” Athena announced during the interview, which you can watch above. Fun fact: The 'X' in AthenaX stands for Xtra cranky Source: Supplied \nVictoria: “I have been completely myself the whole time.” \nAthena: “Yes, your hideous, despicable self, exactly.” \nVictoria: “You wonder why you’re not doing any press? This is why. No one requests you, and this is why.” \nAthena: “Darling, they’re keeping the best for last. The last one that laughs, laughs longer.” \nOuch. And to think, they still have the reunion episodes to film. \nI attempted to lighten the mood. What could go wrong with a fun quiz? I shot the ladies a few rapid-fire questions: Which housewife is richest? Funniest? Quickest to start an argument? \nVictoria pointed straight to Athena. Here we go again ... \n“I actually defend myself. From tools and knobs,” Athena spat back. \nIf anyone’s still under the illusion that the conflict on Real Housewives is confected for the cameras, I can report that after 20 minutes in the presence of these feuding ladies I needed a stiff drink and a lie down. \nSee for yourself when the show premieres 8:30pm this Sunday on Foxtel’s Arena Channel — and visit news.com.au after the show each week for our full episode recap (you don’t want to miss this weekend’s premiere — it’s a CRACKER).
