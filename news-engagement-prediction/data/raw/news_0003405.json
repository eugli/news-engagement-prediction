But I think he was moving towards the decision he made.\" Clement said. \nClement, who worked with Lampard during his time at Chelsea, went onto praise the 38-year-old for his achievements on the pitch: \n\"I fully respect his decision. We had a chat and he appreciated I had called because of our relationship. I am not saying it was close - it did not go very far - but it would have been nice. \n\"It would be great to see Frank continue in the game of football. I am sure he will think about it over the next weeks and months. \n\"He has got a lot to offer and I would like to say congratulations to him on such a wonderful career.\" \n\"I had the pleasure to work with him very closely for two-and-a-half seasons at Chelsea. \n\"I knew him before that because I was at the club in the youth department. I have kept in contact with Frank right up until very recently. I had a couple of messages with him. \n\"What a fantastic player. What an amazing playing career. A great midfielder and one of the most outstanding goalscoring midfielders that the world has ever seen. \n\"The fact that at his peak he was scoring 20 goals a season from midfield is an incredible statistic, a lot of Premier League strikers would be proud of those numbers.\" \nA fitting tribute to a marvelous player. \nThank you for all the memories, Frank.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:38:30.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
