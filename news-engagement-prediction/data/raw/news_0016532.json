Titled ' Halka Halka ', the romantic dance number features Shah Rukh Khan and Mahira Khan in the streets of Gujarat. Shah Rukh Khan in a still from Halka Halka. YouTube \nThe successful combination of Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghoshal have lent the vocals to the song. The two have serenaded multiple popular duets in the past, like ' Shukran Allah', 'Zoobie Doobie', 'Main Agar Kahoon', 'Pal Pal Pal', 'Piyu Bole', 'Dil Dooba ' and 'Main Hoon Na '. Since some of these are hit songs of Shah Rukh, he made it a point to release this song even though it was not included in the film. \nIt is a wise move on part of the makers since the rather average song can gain traction by banking on the success of the film. \nRaees has garnered over Rs 250 crore worldwide and continues to fare well at the box office. This song could also pull some of the audiences to the halls, thus, further enhancing its run at the box office. \nThe song has a tapori touch to it as indicated by one of its hook steps, performed by Shah Rukh. Also, like every other romantic song of the star, he impresses with his charm and hypnotic eyes. \nOn the other hand, Mahira seems to be trying too hard. The rest of the song, including Ram Sampath's music, Javed Akhtar's lyrics, the sets and the choreography are borderline below average. Couldn't let this @SonuNigam song from Raees not spread its magic. Thx to @shreyaghoshal too. Here's #HalkaHalka ! https://t.co/mpVQ832Fhx \nâ€” Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) February 5, 2017 \nEven the otherwise melodious vocals of Nigam and Ghoshal do not do much to uplift the song. Thus, this probably comes as an attempt by Shah Rukh to gain traction on social media after several reports dubbed him as the least bankable Khan since both Salman and Aamir Khan rule the top films of the list of highest Hindi grossers . \nWhile Aamir has Nitesh Tiwari's Dangal, Rajkumar Hirani's PK and Vijay Krishna Acharya's Dhoom 3, Salman has Kabir Khan's Bajrangi Bhaijaan , Ali Abbas Zafar's Sultan and Sajid Nadiadwala's Kick to his credit. On the other hand, Shah Rukh's highest grosser, Rohit Shetty's Chennai Expres s, is ranked sixth in the list of highest Hindi grossers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:43:39.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
