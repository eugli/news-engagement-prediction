But in truth, hip-hop is an ecosystem favoring the industrious — talent scouts, managers, club promoters, photographers, journalists and more. Without all the activity buzzing behind the scenes, the scene itself would be dull. So consider VH1’s “The Breaks,” which has its debut on Monday, a workplace drama taking place at the dawn of hip-hop’s first large-scale identity crisis: Gangster rap is on the rise, political and socially progressive hip-hop still has legs, and lyricism is a priority, but MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice were bringing a high-energy strain of hip-hop, regionally and politically decontextualized, to the pop charts. In this moment, hip-hop was a genre ripe for exposure, as well as mishandling and manipulation. That’s the animating tension of this promising show, which builds off a two-hour TV movie VH1 aired last year . At every turn, hustling and ethics rub up against each other. Ahm (Antoine Harris, blank and ominous), a stoic drug dealer with aspirations to rap, records in secret while his criminal enterprise begins to crumble. Barry Fouray (a hilarious Wood Harris) tries to turn his fledgling management company into a proper record label, playing nice with major label executives while using drugs and sparring with a former business partner. Nikki Jones (Afton Williamson) works as Fouray’s assistant, trading favors as a means to climbing the ladder. DeeVee (Mack Wilds) is trying to make it as a music producer, but risks getting caught up in Ahm’s dark business. (The irony of DeeVee’s rap-hating father being played by Method Man is rich.) “The Breaks” is loosely based on Dan Charnas’s “The Big Payback,” an impressively detailed history of the makings of hip-hop as a business. (Mr. Charnas is an executive producer.) The result is sometimes verisimilitude first, emotions second, with characters taking a few episodes to develop into something resembling real people, rather than allegorical constructs. \n  Unlike the telenovela intrigue of “Empire” — which presumes that hip-hop is already big business, accompanied by epic drama — “The Breaks” takes place in a time when the stakes are still low; therefore the squabbles don’t always rise to true dramatic tension (though the scenes where an enraged radio station boss lays waste to his office with a baseball bat are absurdist fun).
