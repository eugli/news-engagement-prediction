Officers aren't monitoring activity on the bus; they will be watching drivers.\n'Operation Bus Cop' is the first of its kind in Saskatchewan. Regina police traffic unit members will be riding the bus to catch distracted drivers.\nRegina police riding buses to nab car drivers using cellphones The initiative follows in the footsteps of police in other Canadian cities who have used public transit in a similar fashion.\nBus officers used across the country Police forces in Quebec City, Thunder Bay, Ont., Victoria and York Regional Police, outside of Toronto, have used this tactic.\nInsp. Randy Slade of York Regional Police said if an officer spots a motorist with a phone, he radios to another officer in an unmarked car who will pull the driver over.\n\"The drivers, of course, are a little taken aback. In our province, it's a $490 fine and three [demerit] points,\" he said. \"It goes without saying that they're not necessarily in the best of moods.\"\nBut they can always choose not to use their phones and avoid the ticket, he said.\nThe better way to target texting drivers: York Region police ride the bus Undercover police officers target distracted drivers in construction zones One of the advantages for police is that on a bus, they can safely focus on the task at hand.\n\"We're not distracted by driving in a vehicle,\" Slade said. \"We have free range in a bus.\"\nSometimes passengers on the bus will pitch in, pointing out distracted drivers to the officer, he noted.\nSlade said the program is a combination of education and deterrence. It will take about a year before police have gathered the statistics to know if their initiative is deterring people from the behaviour, he said.\nWarnings first, tickets later Regina police officers will begin with warnings to raise awareness. Starting on March 1, though, and through the entire month, tickets will be handed out as 'Operation Bus Cop' rolls out in earnest.\nSGI is partnering with Saskatchewan police forces to focus on distracted driving in the month of March.\nThe ticket for distracted driving is $280.\nOn Jan. 1, the province's new laws aimed at fighting impaired driving went into effect, which included an expanded definition of prohibited cellphone use while driving. Now, you aren't allowed holding, viewing, using or manipulating a cellphone while driving as opposed to simply using a phone.\nDistracted driving by the numbers Although impaired driving remains the No. 1 factor in fatal collisions in Saskatchewan, distracted driving surpassed speed as the No. 2 factor in 2015.\nThat year, there were 33 fatal distracted driving collisions resulting in 36 deaths. That was 14 per cent of all fatal collisions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:18:18.286+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
