We tried to help them understand the realities of the city,” said Nalika Braganza, one of the two teachers who set up the session. \n“The ultimate aim was to inculcate empathy in children from a young age,” she added. \nThe kids seemed to enjoy their time onstage as much as they enjoyed telling their stories. \nThirteen-year-old Tabrez Baasha was “very nervous” before he started speaking. \n“But, after I went for it, I wanted to continue sharing my experiences,” he said. “I want to become an actor when I grow up and appeal to an even larger audience.” \nRead ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:35:11.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
