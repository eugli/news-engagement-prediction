My family was the most important thing to me. \n“They provided me with somewhere safe to grow and learn, and I know I was fortunate not to have been confronted by serious adversity at a young age. \n“For some children, maybe there are some here today; I know that life can sometimes feel difficult and full of challenges. \n“I think that every child should have people around them to show them love, and to show them kindness, and nurture them as they grow.” Samir Hussein via Getty Images \nThe Duchess encouraged children to talk about their feelings rather than keep them inside. \n“If we are worried, upset, lonely or angry – the best thing to do is to talk to someone about it,” she added. “Whether that is your mother or father, a teacher or a friend. \n“If you see someone who you think might need help, try and be kind to them. Keep a look out for them if they are on their own or seem sad or worried. Perhaps they just need a hug or someone to talk to. \n“I know it is hard if you are feeling down yourself. But helping someone out will also make you feel so much better too.” \nThe Duchess’ comments came after Place2Be found that before they reach the end of primary school, almost two thirds (63%) of children say they worry “all the time”. \nIn the survey of 700 Year 6 children across 20 primary schools that work with Place2Be, children’s top concerns were found to be their family (54%), friends being okay (48%), and not doing well at school (41%).
