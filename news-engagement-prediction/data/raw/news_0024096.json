The deducted portion of their pay will then be given to the parents by the State. \n\nThe proposal was mooted in the state budget and the social welfare department is now working towards preparing the necessary draft to bring in the legislation in the current year. \n\n\"It is expected that the percentage of the population over the age of 60 years will continue to increase due to the changing population age structure. Services to cater to this increasing population of the elderly will need to be provided not only by institutional sources but also through familial structures,\" said finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma . \n\n\"The intent behind this scheme is to send a strong message in society and inspire our young population to take good care of those gentle pairs of hands which nurtured them and made them what they are today,\" said Sarma. \n\nTo initiate the process, the government proposed \"a legislative cover to such familial responsibilities.\" The employees working in the government/government undertakings/state PSUs/employees of companies will be expected to take care of their elderly parents in a desirable manner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T11:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:39:28.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
