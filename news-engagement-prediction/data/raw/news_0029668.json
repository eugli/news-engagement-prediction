Two close advisors, Paul Manafort and Mike Flynn , have had to resign due to Russia-related matters.\nLate Tuesday night, several new bombshells further illuminated ties between Trump and Russia. Citing \"four current and former American officials,\" the New York Times reported that members of Trump&apos;s campaign, as well as other associates, had repeatedly talked to \"senior Russian intelligence officials\" in the year leading up to the 2016 election. \nRelated Russia Was in Touch With Trump Campaign During Presidential Campaign Michael Flynn Resigns as National Security Advisor Amidst Russia Controversy Donald Trump Encourages Russia to Hack Hillary Clinton Not long afterwards, CNN followed up with another article  with some more detail, quoting \" multiple current and former intelligence, law enforcement and administration officials\"  saying that the two sides were \"in constant communication.\" Officials told the channel that the back-and-forth \"&apos;raised a red flag&apos; with US intelligence and law enforcement.\"\nThese communications are especially unnerving to officials because they occurred at the exact time that the Russians were hacking the Democratic party , a practice that Trump himself encouraged , though he later claimed he was being \"sarcastic.\"  During this same period, Trump was also publicly praising Russian leader Vladimir Putin . \nThere is no definitive evidence as yet that the communications between Trump&apos;s team and the Russians were about hacking. However, law enforcement and intelligence agencies, including the FBI, are still sorting through all of the information. \nThe news of the connection between Trump&apos;s team and Russian intelligence shocked people on all sides of the political spectrum—even members of Congress.\nAny Americans who conspired w/ the Russian hackers should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law, no matter how high up the trail goes.\n— Joaquin Castro ( @JoaquinCastrotx ) February 15, 2017 If any US citizen conspired with enemy foreign agents to subvert US democracy then that person committed treason.\n— Brendan Boyle ( @RepBrendanBoyle ) February 15, 2017 This report should serve as a clarion call for all of Congress to demand an independent investigation into Russia&apos;s meddling in our election https://t.co/ zG5bQWe8JO \n— Senator Bob Casey ( @SenBobCasey ) February 15, 2017 My GOP stood for freedom, character, national security, trade -- classical-liberal values.
