One week later, on January 31, the IRS made an automatic deposit into the reader's bank account, who then used the refund to pay down his credit card debt the very next day. \nThis is when things turned bizarre, because as our readers writes, just two days later, without warning, on orders of the IRS his bank empties out the bank account handing over its contents to the IRS: \n\" the IRS emptied our bank account February 3, 2017 for erroneous refund with no notice! (please see attached letter ). \n\nCalled them. Our return was fine. The amount of refund was fine. Not an identity theft problem. Error on their side. According to the person I spoke with they are doing this to a large block of filers. They seemed hesitant to give more info. \nHe then adds that \"in our phone conversation they told me that the return was fine and the refund amount was correct, it was not an over refund issue but some kind of IRS internal error and they would reissue the same refund after receiving the money back. It makes absolutely no sense to me but this is what I was told.\" \nSo, as our reader summarizes, \"no outstanding taxes. Never been audited. Always file on time. Not a small business, just a normal employee W2, not a structuring issue. Only typical deductions and student loan interest. Scrambling to cancel auto payments and trying to figure out how we will pay mortgage and any payment that will not accept credit card . \nHis question, \" how can this be legal with no notice?\" is not simply rhetorical. To be sure, the IRS has virtually unlimited rights over individual fund flows and stock, among which to: File a tax lien against you; Levy your bank account;", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:12:09.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
