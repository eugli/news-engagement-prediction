In fact, the NFL claims that she's the first artist who's ever gone from singing the national anthem at the game to performing at halftime the very next year. The Super Bowl was last held in Houston in 2004, the year Janet Jackson's notorious \" wardrobe malfunction \" scandal led the NFL to turn to \"safe\" classic rock acts as halftime performers. Since then, the halftime show headliners have included the Rolling Stones , Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, The Who, U2 and Paul McCartney. Lady Gaga Hopes Her Super Bowl Performance Will Unite People Contemporary pop returned to the scene in 2011, when the Black Eyed Peas performed; no wardrobe malfunctions ensued. Lady Gaga has assured reporters that there won't be any on Sunday, either. The trend of having current big-name music stars perform in the Super Bowl halftime show only dates back to 1991, when New Kids on the Block took the stage. Before that, halftime consisted of marching bands, older stars like Chubby Checker and Ella Fitzgerald, or the G-rated vocal troupe Up With People. That's because initially, the halftime show was designed to entertain the audience in the stands, not those viewing at home. As the New York Times put it, \"It was decades before the N.F.L. realized that the halftime show plays not to the stadium but to the camera.\" But after 1991, it was all stars, all the time, especially in 1993, when Michael Jackson , the reigning King of Pop, sang \"Heal the World\" with thousands of children. Here's a reminder of who's played Super Bowl halftime shows in the modern era: 1991 -- New Kids on the Block 1992 -- Gloria Estefan 1993 -- Michael Jackson, performing with 3,500 children 1994 -- Country stars Clint Black, Tanya Tucker, Travis Tritt, Wynonna, and Naomi Judd 1995 -- Patti Labelle, Miami Sound Machine & Tony Bennett 1996 -- Diana Ross 1997 -- ZZ Top, James Brown, the Blues Brothers featuring Dan Aykroyd, John Goodman and James Belushi 1998 -- Boyz II Men, Smokey Robinson, Martha Reeves, the Temptations, Queen Latifah 1999 -- Stevie Wonder, Gloria Estefan , Big Bad Voodoo Daddy 2000 -- Phil Collins, Christina Aguilera, Enrique Iglesias, Toni Braxton 2001 -- Aerosmith, 'N Sync, Britney Spears, Nelly, Mary J.
