Earlier this month, One Nation's federal leader Pauline Hanson hit out at journalists and politicians, including Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese, who had called for Mr Archibald to be disendorsed for saying single mothers were producing 'lazy and ugly' children. 'To all the fat lazy politicians and fat lazy journalists in the fat lazy media playing fat lazy political correctness, identity politics - the answer is no,' the Queensland senator wrote on Twitter. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson earlier this month hit out at journalists and politicians calling for David Archibald to be disendorsed over his comments on single mothers One Nation's candidate for the Pilbara electorate says government welfare is stopping human evolution David Archibald said government welfare was stopping human evolution by stopping the 'winnowing of the bad' CONTROVERSIAL ONE NATION CANDIDATES Pastor Lawrence Shave, 73, running in Dawesville, advertised for bikini baristas in 2015 and later for a Russian mail order bride, aged 20 to 44. His ex-wife Michelle Meyers, in Bateman, picketed abortion clinics and said homosexuals were using 'Nazi mind control strategies'. Rozane Bezuidenhout, the Cannington candidate, posted a petition on Facebook calling for the return of white rule in South Africa. In another article for the Australian conservative Quadrant magazine in August 2015, Mr Archibald described gay marriage as 'degenerate'. 'It is possible that the incidence of homosexuality is an acceptable loss, in evolutionary terms, so that the rest of the males can be more male-like. 'Viewed in that way, homosexuality is part of the human condition. But so is marriage – it is more than just a social construct. 'A successful culture wouldn’t mix the two. A degenerate culture might.' In the same opinion piece, titled 'Evolution versus Gay Marriage' he said pregnant women in the Middle East were stoned to death during the time of Jesus' birth. 'Marriage as a social institution was reinforced in part by stoning to death women who became pregnant outside of marriage,' he said. 'The miracle of Mary’s virgin birth has been explained as an act of charity by Joseph in taking in a pregnant woman who otherwise would have been stoned to death.' Mr Archibald, who is running against Nationals leader Brendon Grylls, is the latest controversial One Nation candidate to be running in Western Australia. Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Archibald for a response on Facebook.
