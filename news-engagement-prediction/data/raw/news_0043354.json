Published 9 minutes ago. NICHOLAS KAMM / AFP \nUnited States President Donald Trump on Sunday created anger and confusion by seemingly referring to a refugee-driven terror attack in Sweden that did not in fact take place. The White House rushed to clarify his statements, even as Sweden reacted with amusement and derision. “Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking?

Questions abound. https://t.co/XWgw8Fz7tj — Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) February 19, 2017 \nAt one of his latest rallies, Trump was mid-rant about refugees when he said, “look at what’s happening last night in Sweden”, amidst a list of terror attacks in Europe. “Sweden, who would believe this? he said.

Though Conway later said she misspoke, several publications noted that she had referred to the supposed incident several times in the past.
