Rec Photo by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images The Ole Miss football program is self-imposing a one-year postseason ban. The news comes as the university announced Wednesday the NCAA is accusing it of eight additional athletic compliance violations, on top of 13 allegations the NCAA levied against Ole Miss last year . There are eight new allegations, now 21 in total. BREAKING After receiving revised notice from the NCAA, #OleMiss is self-imposing a one-year post-season ban for the 2017 CFB season. — Bruce Feldman (@BruceFeldmanCFB) February 22, 2017 The university announced the new allegations in a videotaped statement featuring Ole Miss chancellor Jeff Vitter, athletic director Ross Bjork, and head football coach Hugh Freeze. That video runs about 20 minutes long. Here’s the video in text form , basically. Ole Miss isn’t contesting everything the NCAA is alleging. There are three new allegations with which the school is agreeing there is “sufficient credible and persuasive evidence to support the allegation.” They are: A recruit went hunting on a booster’s private land during an official visit in 2013, then on two or three occasions after signing and enrolling at Ole Miss. This is a Level III NCAA violation — not as bad as a Level II or, the worst, a Level I. A former Ole Miss staffer set up improper lodging and transportation benefits for two recruits between March 2014 and January 2015. These benefits were worth more than $2,000, the NCAA says, and are classified as the most serious type of allegation: Level I. That same staffer lied to both the NCAA and Ole Miss about knowingly committing recruiting violations. That’s a Level I, too. This post will be updated.
