A number of bizarre-looking creatures, which usually live at depths of 3,000ft, have been found dead along the country's coasts. Many locals and some scientists believe these so-called 'sea serpents' wash up onto shore by strong currents that precede quakes. Scroll down for video The giant sea serpent was found on a beach in Agusan del Norte in the Philippines. A killer earthquake ravaged Mindanao island and many believe that oarfish washing ashore is a sign that an earthquake will soon follow OARFISH First sighted in 1772, they are the world's longest bony fish. These mysterious sea creatures usual stay in the depths of the ocean - between about 1,000 to 3,000 feet (300 to 900 metres) below the surface. They can grow up to 50 feet (15 metres) long. Some scientists believe the deep-dwelling species might be pushed upwards by strong currents. This could be caused by movements in the continental shelf. All Oarfish sighted in shallow waters are either dead or dying. They are naturally blue, purple and red, but this colour quickly disappears when they die. There has been examples of this happening as recently as this month. A giant oarfish was found on a beach in Agusan del Norte in the Philippines just days before a killer earthquake ravaged Mindanao island on 11 February. Five more oarfish were found around the coast in the days following the 6.3 quake. Eight people were killed and 200 injured which sparked social media discussion about the link between these creatures and natural disasters. The latest find on Saturday was of a creature on a beach in the city of Cagayan de Oro, measuring around 15 feet long. An official from the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said a similar earthquake could happen in Cagayan de Oro City anytime. 'This is not to scare people but to spread awareness, to encourage the local government units to collaborate with us and for them to know what should be done', the Regional Director Marcial Labininay told Filipino website sunstar.com . Mr Labininay dismissed claims that the emergence of oarfish signals impending disaster and said it was based on superstition. Scientists have suggested this deep-dwelling species might be pushed onto the continental shelf by strong currents. Shallower waters are typically rougher which means they are more likely to suffer fatal damage. Oarfish normally feed on crustaceans and are unlikely to be able to find them in shallower waters. All the ones sighted are either dead or dying. RELATED ARTICLES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:53:05.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
