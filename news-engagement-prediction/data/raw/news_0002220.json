Frail Eileen Blane, 87, was kicked and punched to the ground by a vicious robber who forced his way into her home, in Stretford, Greater Manchester, on Friday afternoon. Police are investigating the shocking robbery and the great-grandmother's family have released images of Eileen's injuries - in a bid to shame the thug who attacked her and to flush out information. The ordeal began when she answered the door to the caller at her home - but she was grabbed and dragged her down the hallway. The robber then pushed her against the hob in the kitchen, demanding gold and money, telling her she 'wouldn't get out of the house alive'. He then ripped the wedding ring from her finger and kicked her to the floor before picking up her beloved dog and throwing it at the wall. Eileen escaped when the thief went upstairs. She grabbed pet Sammie and ran out of the house to the safety of a neighbour who rang police and paramedics. Blane received blows to the head. Her family released photos in a bid to flush out the thief Granddaughter Hayley Blane says her grandma has been left extremely shaken by the attack The robber saw her flee, and he too made off from the scene, taking the treasured ring, money and her purse. Granddaughter Hayley Blane, 26, says her grandma has been left extremely shaken by the attack. She said great-grandmother Eileen has lived at the property on Castleton Avenue all her life, and even gave birth to her children there. She said: 'My granddad died 13 years ago and the reason she has never moved into something smaller is because of all the memories.
