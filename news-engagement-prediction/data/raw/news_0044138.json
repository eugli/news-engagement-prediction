Some threw stones, Conta added. \nTwenty-six of the arrested were juveniles and were released on bail, while 25 were being detained pending an investigation, Conta said. \nA spokesman for the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Construction (APRC), Jammeh’s party when he was in power, said those arrested were APRC supporters and were wearing t-shirts bearing an image of Jammeh’s face. \n“They were provoked by the supporters of the coalition (Barrow’s party) who … were calling Jammeh all sorts of names and saying he was a killer. Then a quarrel ensued,” said spokesman Seedy Njie. \nHuman rights groups accuse Jammeh of torturing and killing opponents during his time in power. Barrow has pledged to reverse many of Jammeh’s policies, including arbitrary detention. \nBarrow vowed in his Saturday speech to enact sweeping reforms including bolstering a weakened economy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:19:33.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
