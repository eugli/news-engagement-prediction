'I'm glad they ate well that weekend because I spent most of that weekend throwing up from absolute fear, Mr Brandis, that if my pension is removed, what will become of us? I have no family,' Ms Thorpe said. Fred Thorpe pictured asked why her disability pension was being reviewed when politicians have extravagant expenses She laughed at Mr Bandis' suggestion to call Centrelink to sort out notices that had been sent by mistake Mr Brandis later said if a notice appears to have been issued by mistake, 'they can contact Centrelink and sort out the problem'. The audience burst into laughter and moderator Tony Jones observed: 'I will just point out that Fred almost fell over laughing at that one.' 'The idea that you can just ring Centrelink and have a chat to them,' Sydney MP Tanya Plibersek, who was part of Monday's panel, said before directing a question at Ms Thorpe. 'How long did you wait on the phone the last time you called Centrelink?' she asked Ms Thorpe. The pensioner replied she had spent an hour and a half every day for a fortnight trying to get through to Centrelink. She's not the first to complain about how difficult it is to get a Centrelink representative on the phone. ABC host Leigh Sales recently savaged Centrelink in a bizarre Twitter tirade, demanding to know why she had been left on hold for two hours twice in a week. Others jumped on the bandwagon with their own experiences - and slammed the welfare provider's claim that the average wait time was only 16 minutes. 'This is absolutely not your fault - Centrelink is so desperately underfunded - but 12/16 mins is just not true,' one user tweeted.
