It was bound for fishing grounds on the southwest coast of Newfoundland.\nIt was never seen or heard from again.\n\"Back in 1917, the community wouldn't have been that big, then you have 21 of your men taken away in one tragedy,\" said Howard Lundrigan, who lost a cousin in the sinking.\nEighteen widows and 57 children were left without husbands and fathers.\n\"It was almost like a whole community was devastated with the loss of these men,\" he told CBC Radio's The Broadcast .\nWithout a trace Despite the magnitude of the tragedy, it was rarely spoken of when Howard Lundrigan was a boy.\nA Daily News article dated March 21, 1917 reports no sign of the Mina Swim. (Mina Swim Memorial Website)\nBecause it disappeared without a trace, the Mina Swim left behind few of the details we expect from shipwreck stories.\nThere was no rescue attempt, no bodies recovered, no tale of where and how the schooner went down.\n\"There was really not much of a story,\" said Lundrigan, adding that relatives of the crew members tended to stay quiet about it. \"When they were asked, they would just say, 'Oh, they were lost on the boat.'\"\nIn 2011, residents formed a committee to revive and preserve the memory of the Mina Swim.\n\"A lot of people on the committee were descendants (of crew members) and so we decided to put up a memorial.\"\nFamiliar names on monument The Memorial Monument was unveiled in 2013, overlooking Burin Bay Arm. It bears the names of all 21 crew members.\n\"Burin names like Lundrigans, Brushetts, Planks, Mitchells â€” there are still people here with those last names,\" Lundrigan said.\nWith the memorial in place, and the marking of the 100th anniversary, Howard Lundrigan hopes an important piece of local history is now secure for future generations.\n\"I think we would have been the last generation to talk about it in any great detail, and even we don't have a lot of detail. But without the memorial, I'm certain that within a number of years it would have been forgotten.\"\nThe anniversary will begin with an ecumenical service at St. Patrick's Church, beginning at 3 p.m., the same time the Mina Swim set sail 100 years ago.\nThe service will be followed by a wreath laying at the Mina Swim Memorial, weather permitting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:09:47.396+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
