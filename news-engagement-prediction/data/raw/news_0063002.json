Reporters “shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name,” he declared, just hours after members of his own staff held a press briefing and refused to allow their names to be used.\n“A source says that Donald Trump is a horrible, horrible human being, let them say it to my face,” Trump told the Conservative Political Action Committee. “Let there be no more sources.”\nMembers of Trump’s White House team regularly demand anonymity when talking to reporters.\nTrump said he wasn’t against all the press, just “the fake news media or press.”\n“I’m against the people that make up stories and make up sources,” he said. “They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name.”\nThe president has chafed at a number of anonymously sourced stories, including numerous reports describing contacts between his campaign officials and the Russians, which the White House has sharply disputed.\n“The fake news doesn’t tell the truth,” Trump insisted. “It doesn’t represent the people. It will never represent the people and we’re going to do something about it.”\nIt was a triumphal return to CPAC for Trump, who was warmly welcomed by a crowd that loves pushback against the mainstream media.\nAfter his broadside on the press, Trump turned to a recitation of his agenda, promising bold action on health care, trade, energy policy and more.\n“One by one, we’re checking off the promises we made to the American people,” he said, telling the group “I will not disappoint you.”\nTrump told the conservatives the health care law he inherited from President Barack Obama threatens to bring about “total catastrophe,” reiterating his promise to repeal and replace it.\nWhile conservatives aren’t always in sync with Trump’s views, they’re happy to have a scrapper in the White House who’s often on their side.\n“How good it feels to have somebody lead our country who knows how to fight,” American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp told the crowd in introducing Trump.\nTrump recalled his past visits at CPAC with nostalgia, saying he’d first appeared with no notes and little preparation and gotten a strong reception that helped to put him on the path to the presidency.\n“I loved the commotion. Polls went through the roof and I wasn’t even running, but it gave me an idea,” he said.\nSix years ago Trump stepped to the CPAC stage as the “money, money, money, money” chorus of his reality TV show theme song blared. The crowd was less than adoring, occasionally laughing and booing the former Democrat.\nAlthough Trump returned in ensuing years, he was notably absent last year. ACU chairman Schlapp said the presidential candidates were asked to participate in a question-and-answer session, but Trump had wanted to make a speech.\nHe did show up in 2015, however, a few months before he announced his candidacy.\n“I am really inclined. I want to do it so badly,” Trump said about the likelihood he’d run.\nNow, CPAC is largely the Trump show — “TPAC,” White House counselor Kellyanne Conway called it.\nSchlapp said Trump will be the first president to address the group during his first year in office since Ronald Reagan in 1981. He called that a “huge sign of respect.”\nIn his first appearance, Trump tried to burnish his conservative credentials with assertions that he is prolife and anti-gun control, while heaping praise on himself and his business acumen.\nAnd he appeared to test-drive the “make America great again” phrase that would become his 2016 presidential campaign slogan. “Our country will be great again,” he said. He trademarked that phrase in 2012, just after Mitt Romney lost to Obama.\nHe told the skeptical crowd: “I have a reputation for telling it like it is. I’m known for my candor.”\nAn angry audience member shouted: “You have zero chance of getting elected.”\n__\nAssociated Press writer Andrew Taylor contributed to this report. __\nFollow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/bykowicz", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/bykowicz"], "published": "2017-02-24T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:51:15.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
