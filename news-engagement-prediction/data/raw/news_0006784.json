Sriracha Ranch? You’d better believe it. But real-deal Ranch can’t be forced. Just ask Courtney McBroom of Large Marge, who stopped by the MUNCHIES Garden a little while back to gather some herbs for her very own version. RECIPE: Ranch Dressing “Ranch is the bastard child of salad dressing,” says Courtney. “Everyone hates on it, but I don’t understand why. I truly believe that if someone hates on it, it’s because they think it’s trashy, but I have never met a single person that was every pissed off when I served Ranch dressing at a dinner party.” Her version is much like Henson’s original. All you need is some dairy, some mayo, and whatever fresh herbs you have on hand. Her secret is just a dash of fish sauce for that umami oomph . Serve it on salad, as a dip, on your lover’s abdomen, or straight from the spoon into your mouth. Drizzle it on your pizza; dip your quesadilla in it. There’s no shame in this game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:37:51.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
