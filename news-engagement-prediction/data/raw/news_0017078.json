If you look closely, not only PAP MPs are clapping but WP Opposition MPs too! \nIf you watch the video, some PAP MPs are clapping but their faces are like stoned and so forced. Compare it with Mr Low Thia Khiang and his very genuine clapping and smile when PM Lee blows out his cake. \nEven though both men crossed swords on many issues in Parliament, Mr Low remains classy and celebrates the Prime Minister's birthday in earnest. Such behaviour is rare and worthy to highlight. \nRespect you Mr Low Thia Khiang and bless you with good health and happiness. \nMdm Chow A.S.S.
