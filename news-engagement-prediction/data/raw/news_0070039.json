It's not been a great past few weeks for the Arsenal manager... Credit: ITV \nWenger went ballistic at Taylor, who abruptly sent the Frenchman to the stands, before Alexis Sanchez won the game for Arsenal with a 96th minute spot kick of his own, after a penalty was wrongly awarded in favour of Laurent Koscielny when the Frenchman should have been flagged offside. \nIt has now been revealed what Wenger said to Taylor during his outburst, and it's little surprise he was subjected to the four match ban the FA slapped him with. \"Fuck off, m8\" Wenger had no time for Anthony Taylor during his side's recent victory over Burnley. Image: PA \nThe Arsenal boss told Taylor to \"fuck off\" twice before telling him \"You are dishonest to your federation\". \nIn his report, Taylor wrote, \"Following the award of a penalty kick against his team in approx. 92nd min, Mr Wenger left his technical area to confront me in disagreement at the decision. Before he said anything I said: 'Think carefully before you say anything.' \n\"He responded by saying 'you are dishonest to your federation.' I considered this to be questioning both mine and the referee, Jon Moss's integrity and impartiality. I stated to Mr. Wenger that such a comment was not acceptable and he told me to \"fuck off\" on two separate occasions.\" \nWenger's actions, which also included pushing Taylor in the tunnel, also saw him hit with a Â£25,000 fine by the FA. Had he realised just how lucky his team had been to leave the match with all three points, he'd have presumably been hugging the officials instead, at the final whistle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:04:58.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
