Rumours get crazy \nJournalist Ian McGarry has posted a whole different claims on social media, claiming that Chelsea were never interested in signing the French forward. \nInstead, it’s claimed that Liverpool were the big Premier League club who tried to land the Celtic striker. \nJurgen Klopp was rebuffed twice in his efforts to land Brendan Rodgers’ star. \nMcGarry finally claimed that two other unnamed clubs tried to sign Dembele. \nWho to believe? #Celtic rejected bid from #LFC and enquiries from two other clubs for Dembele. There was no interest from Chelsea. #CFC . \n— Ian McGarry (@garbosj) January 31, 2017 Loading tags...
