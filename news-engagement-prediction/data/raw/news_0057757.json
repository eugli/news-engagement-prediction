Christian Ude, Creative Commons License Updated October 25, 2016 . Question: What Is Alum? \nAnswer: Usually when you hear about alum it is in reference to potassium alum, which is the hydrated form of potassium aluminum sulfate and has the chemical formula KAl(SO 4 ) 2 ·12H 2 O. However, any of the compounds with the empirical formula AB(SO 4 ) 2 ·12H 2 O are considered to be alum. Sometimes alum is seen in its crystalline form, although it is most often sold as a powder. Potassium alum is a fine white powder that you can find sold with kitchen spices or pickling ingredients. It is also sold as a large crystal as a \"deodorant rock\" for underarm use. Types of Alum Potassium Alum Potassium alum is also known as potash alum or tawas. It is aluminum potassium sulfate. This is the type of alum that you find in the grocery store for pickling and in baking powder . It is also used in leather tanning, as a flocculant in water purification, as an ingredient in aftershave and as a treatment to fireproof textiles. It's chemical formula is KAl(SO 4 ) 2 .\n\ncontinue reading below our video Grow Alum Crystals Soda Alum Soda alum has the formula NaAl(SO 4 ) 2 ·12H 2 O. It is used in baking powder and as an acidulent in food.\nAmmonium Alum Ammonium alum has the formula NH 4 Al(SO 4 ) 2 ·12H 2 O. Ammonium alum is used for many of the same purposes as potassium alum and soda alum. Ammonium alum finds applications in tanning, dyeing textiles, making textiles flame retardant, in the manufacture of porcelain cements and vegetable glues, in water purification and in some deodorants.\nChrome Alum Chrome alum or chromium alum has the formula KCr(SO 4 ) 2 ·12H 2 O. This deep violet compound is used in tanning and can be added to other alum to grow lavender or purple crystals.\nSelenate Alums Selenate alums occur when selenium takes the place of sulfur , so that instead of a sulfate you get a selenate, (SeO 4 2- ). The selenium-containing alums are strong oxidizing agents, so they can be used as antiseptics, among other uses.\nThis compound is also known as papermaker's alum. However, it is not technically an alum. Uses of Alum \nAlum has several household and industrial uses. Potassium alum is used most often, although ammonium alum, ferric alum and soda alum may be used for many of the same purposes. purification of drinking water as a chemical flocculant in styptic pencil to stop bleeding from minor cuts adjuvant in vaccines (chemical that enhances immune response) deodorant \"rock\" pickling agent to help keep pickles crisp flame retardant the acidic component of some types of baking powder an ingredient in some homemade and commercial modeling clay an ingredient in some depilatory (hair removal) waxes skin whitener ingredient in some brands of toothpaste Alum Projects \nThere are several interesting science projects that use alum. In particular, it is used to grow stunning non-toxic crystals. Clear crystals result from potassium alum , while purple crystals grow from chrome alum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:40:57.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
