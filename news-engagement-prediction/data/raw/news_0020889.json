On the other end it was his daughter saying: \"Dad, I think this is you.\" \nShe was referring to a 1960s photo of three children at South Melbourne Market — and she was right. \nMr Papadopoulos's daughter had stumbled across the old black and white photo on South Melbourne Market Facebook page. \nIt was among a series of archival photos posted to celebrate the markets' 150th birthday. \nAs children, every Saturday morning Theo, Helen (Agouridis) and Harry Papadopoulos headed to the markets with their mother to do the weekly shop and to feast on dim sims. \n\"We were born and raised in South Melbourne; our parents came out [from Greece] in the 50s,\" Mrs Agouridis said. \n\"We grew up on Martin Street in South Melbourne. We went to school literally up the street. \n\"South Melbourne was our world.\" \nThe weekly trip to the South Melbourne Markets was also routine for many members of their extended Greek family, all living in the South Melbourne area at the time. \n\"It wasn't just us, it was every relative that we have around here, and we had quite a few of them,\" Mr Papadopoulos said. \n\"Everyone seemed to be here on the Saturday — they just happened to get a photo of us.\" \nWhile Theo, Helen and Harry are all now in their 50s, with children and grandchildren of their own and living in different areas of Melbourne, South Melbourne Market is still an important place for them all to visit. \n\"Every friend that I have has been down at the markets with me and I've introduced them to the dim sims,\" Mr Papadopoulos said. \n\"It feels good being here. It's home being here. It doesn't matter where we live now.\" \nThe dim sim is clearly not traditional Greek cuisine but it is the drawcard that brings the Papadopoulos family regularly back to the markets. \n\"Clearly, we're Greek, but pretty much everyone in our family loves dim sims — so that brings people back if nothing else,\" Mrs Agouridis said. \nAnd while neither Theo, Helen nor Harry can remember having their photo taken on that Saturday morning back in the late 60s, they are thrilled it has been discovered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T14:30:53.595+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
