Crystal Palace vs Middlesbrough: Premier League preview \n“The Palace fanbase will be doing what it does best and creating a strong, unified front,” say the Holmesdale Fanatics. “We have stood together and made it count at Play-off Finals, facing liquidation, relegation and coming from three goals down against Liverpool [2013-14 season] — that is what Palace are famed for and, as a club, these are our strengths. \n“This season will go down to the wire and these games are now do or die. The players know what must be done and they will have support from the stands in doing it. \n“We can restore the unity and spirit which has defined the Palace way that has made us so successful these last few years. In the players and supporters working together and uniting the club, we have the power to climb out of this situation. Tomorrow can be a turning point.” \nPalace chairman Steve Parish went into the home dressing room after the Sunderland defeat to speak to the players and get across the sense of frustration among fans.

This season by seemingly moving away from this blueprint in such a short space of time and embracing aspects of the corporate side of the Premier League we have lost what made us unique as a club and have eroded that fighting spirit which had made us strong.” \nSelhurst Park is seen by many as having one of the best atmospheres in the Premier League but Palace have the worst home record in the top flight this season. \nThey have won just twice at home and lost nine of their 12 matches. \n“The reaction to the Sunderland performance came from over a years’ worth of frustrations in the Premier League,” say the Holmesdale Fanatics. \n“If we can do our bit to restore this spirit, we can make Selhurst the intimidating place that it used to be and recapture our home form.” More about:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T17:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:26:35.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
