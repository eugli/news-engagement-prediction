Semi Ojeleye (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:58 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:58 p.m. ET \nRecruiting can be a difficult process for young athletes trying to decide where to advance their futures. \nSemi Ojeleye, one of the top recruits in the Class of 2013, was certain Duke would be his answer. \nMORE: This is the year Gonzaga proves doubters wrong \nUnfortunately, like several players before him, and surely after him, Ojeleye's first choice didn't work out. The 6-8 power forward couldn't get on the court with the Blue Devils, so he took his talents elsewhere. \nLuckily for the SMU Mustangs, Ojeleye wound up on their doorstep amid a season of scandal and probation. \nSMU won 25 games last season, which normally would have easily secured them a spot in the NCAA Tournament, but sanctions led to a year without a postseason. \nWhile the Mustangs were dealing with the harsh reality of a lost season, Ojeleye, was watching on the bench, sitting out one year after transferring from Duke midway through the 2014-15 season. \nOjeleye was averaging just 3.0 points in 10.5 minutes per game off Duke's bench as a sophomore before leaving the school. Now, he's one of the most feared two-way players in the nation. Heading into Sunday's 60-51 upset win against Cincinnati, Ojeleye was averaging 18.2 points and 6.8 rebounds per game. He was also shooting over 41 percent from beyond the arc. \nOjeleye continued his fine form by putting up 18 points with four rebounds in the rivalry game, while also making life difficult for Cincinnati's frontcourt on the other end. \nThe Mustangs (22-4) haven't generated a lot of buzz this season — mainly because casual college basketball fans probably still think they are prohibited from playing in the tournament — but that is not the case. \nSMU has won at least 25 games each of the last three seasons and appear on pace to do it again. Though the Mustangs only play six guys, they play at a tempo that allows everyone ample opportunities to remain sharp. \nNo one under 6-5 plays for SMU, and most of the time they feature a lineup that consists of three 6-6 shooters and two 6-8 beasts in the post. \nOjeleye is the team's catalyst. His story proves that college basketball isn't just a gateway to the NBA — even in the one-and-done era. \nSometimes star players develop while on campus, and sometimes it takes them a couple years and a couple programs to do it.
