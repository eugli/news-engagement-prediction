It can be possible that their sermons may incite hatred or jeopardise the harmonious relations between the different races of Malaysia,” he told a press conference yesterday. \nIdris revealed that 157 foreign preachers held sermons and talks in Malacca from 2015 to last year. \nMost of them were from Indonesia, while the others were from Pakistan, Thailand, India, Yemen, Iraq and Syria. \n“I’m also afraid the talks could lead to radicalism, distrust and abhorrence of other faiths. \n“Some of these (foreign) preachers were egoistic and not willing to compromise on our values of preserving Malaysia’s rich diversity of cultures and religions. \n“Islam teaches us to care for others, but some of these foreign preachers have their own views.” \nIn April last year, controversial speaker Dr Zakir Naik was barred from giving a talk titled “Similarities Between Hinduism and Islam”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:39:55.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
