PUBLISHED: 22:18, Sat, Feb 25, 2017 | UPDATED: 22:28, Sat, Feb 25, 2017 GETTY Tim Visser going onto score Scotland's second try in the 29-13 win over Wales \nCotter’s side scored 20 unanswered second-half points to claim victory at Murrayfield, with wings Tommy Seymour and Tim Visser crossing for tries and man-of-the-match Finn Russell booting two conversions and five penalties for a first success against the men in red since 2007. \nRob Howley’s side blew three clear chances and only had themselves to blame for defeat. Liam Williams scored their only try, Leigh Halfpenny adding eight points, but their accuracy in attack let them down. \nThe knives will be out for Wales after this result but for Scotland, it’s a different story. They travel to Twickenham in two weeks to face an England side who, should they beat Italy this afternoon, will be on a 17-match unbeaten run. \nTheir game with Scotland would give them the chance to equal New Zealand’s record winning streak of 18 games, but Cotter wants his team to end another Six Nations hoodoo. \nA Scottish win at Twickenham would be their first at HQ in 34 years, but Cotter said: “I’m really pleased for a number of reasons. GETTY Stuart Hogg celebrates after Scotland's win over Wales in the Six Nations \n“The players adjusted well in the second half and we scored some nice tries. It was a very good second half performance. We know how hard it will be at Twickenham. \n“It could be the record game for England and there will be plenty to play for. There are lots of little things which mean we need to be up for that game.” \nScotland had to rely on the boot of Russell to keep them in this encounter as they turned around 13-9 down. Williams’ score had put Wales in control, but the second half was a different story. \nCotter’s men were a different team after the break and with Wales failing to find the final pass when it mattered most, they took advantage. \nRhys Webb saw a try ruled out and the lively scrum-half knocked on after a scintillating Jonathan Davies break, summing up Wales’ attacking woes. GETTY Vern Cotter is hoping to end England's winning streak \nSeymour struck in the 44th minute, finishing off a pass from Visser, and grounding the ball in the corner despite the score being sent to the television match official. \nHarlequins flyer Visser then turned from creator to scorer, his effort the game’s crucial moment. \nIt was the least Scotland deserved, with Russell, Stuart Hogg – who must start at full-back for the Lions this summer – and captain John Barclay all turning in excellent performances. \nRussell was inch-perfect from the tee and ended the game with 19 points to leave his team still in with a shot of this year’s title. \n“We took the game to Wales and it’s been a while since we’ve beaten them so I have to take my hat off to the players,” Cotter said.
