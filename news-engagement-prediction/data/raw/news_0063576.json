As the singer prepares to welcome her first child , we take a look at the friends and family members who will be there to offer a helping hand, starting with her soulmate and father of her child, Liam Payne . The One Direction star, 23, recently said he's \"the happiest\" he's been in a while, but Liam will be smiling even broader when his little bundle of joy arrives. \nWhy Cheryl and Liam are the perfect match \nThe Steal My Girl singer has previously said he would love to be a dad, and we're betting that Liam, who is madly in love with Cheryl, will be the best, hands-on father to his firstborn. Liam may be taking advice from his bandmate Louis Tomlinson , who has a one-year-old son Freddie Reign, or getting help from his other bandmate Niall Horan, who is the proud uncle to adorable nephew Theo. Niall himself admitted that he was \"looking forward\" to meeting the next One Direction baby. Of the parents-to-be, Niall said: \"He's great and she's lovely. It will be a lovely child .\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:18:23.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
