The franchise tag for running backs isn’t too expensive, relatively speaking, and the Steelers didn’t wait until Wednesday’s deadline to slap the tag on him.\n[ STACK: Why Cowboys legends want Zeke Elliott to stop hurdling defenders ]\nNot only did Bell get the franchise tag, the Steelers gave him the exclusive tag, meaning he can’t negotiate with other teams. That news came from multiple outlets including NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport. The running back tag is about $12.4 million for one season.\nBell will presumably want a long-term deal, and the Steelers will have to figure out how to accommodate him. Bell is just 25 years old, is coming off a season in which he had 1,884 total yards in just 12 regular-season games, but he has a couple of high-profile suspensions already and expensive long-term deals with running backs rarely are good investments for teams.\n[ STACK: Adidas is offering an actual island to the NFL prospect who breaks the NFL Combine 40-yard dash record\nAs far as 2017 goes, there wasn’t any tough decision for the Steelers. Bell will be sticking around in Pittsburgh. It’s up to both sides now to figure out a way to extend the relationship beyond that.\nLe’Veon Bell was given the exclusive franchise tag.
