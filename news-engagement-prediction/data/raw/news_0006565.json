Not me!” Iran is playing with fire - they don't appreciate how \"kind\" President Obama was to them. Not me! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 \nZarif swiftly posted a response, saying: “Iran unmoved by threats as we derive security from our people. We'll never initiate war, but we can only rely on our own means of defense.” Iran unmoved by threats as we derive security from our people.

Let us see if any of those who complain can make the same statement.” We will never use our weapons against anyone, except in self-defense.

Throughout his campaign, Trump accused the Obama administration of being insufficiently tough on Iran and vowed to crack down if elected. \nIt was unclear exactly which entities would be sanctioned. Many sanctions on Iran that had been imposed in response to its nuclear program were lifted in the final years of the Obama administration as part of the nuclear deal the U.S. and world powers brokered. Some of those penalties could be re-imposed under separate sanction authorities unrelated to nuclear issues. \nThat prospect raises the possibility of a fresh confrontation between the U.S. and Iran, which has forcefully argued that it considers any new sanctions a violation of the nuclear deal. The U.S. has maintained that it retains the right to sanction Iran for other behavior such as supporting terrorism. \nTrump’s team stepped up its rhetoric against Iran over ballistic missile tests and a recent attack on a Saudi naval vessel by Tehran-backed militants. \nMilitary officials told Fox News that Iran actually has conducted two recent missile tests, one on Dec. 6 and another this past Sunday. \nU.N. resolution 2231 calls on the Islamic Republic not to conduct such tests. The resolution bars Iran from conducting ballistic missile tests for eight years and went into effect on July 20, 2015, days after the landmark nuclear deal was agreed to in Vienna. \nFox News’ Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
