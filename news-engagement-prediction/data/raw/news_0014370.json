Hours later, according to CNN's Dan Merica, the White House produced a list of terror attacks from the last two years that the administration believes didn't receive enough media attention. However, that list is problematic for at least two big reasons and one petty reason. \nFirst, the petty reason: Whoever typed out the document, which names 78 incidents which took place between September 2014 and December 2016, repeatedly misspelled the word \"attacker.\" It's a pretty egregious misspelling, too: \"atakker.\" \nOf course, a mere misspelling doesn't invalidate the substance of Trump's argument. What invalidates the substance of Trump's argument is the fact that several of these attacks, contrary to the White House's claims , did receive substantial media attention. \nFor instance, the document lists the 2015 attack in Merced, California, in which an assailant wounded four people with a knife. The media didn't ignore this incident. Rather, it received coverage on CNN , the Los Angeles Times , the New York Daily News , Fox News , the Washington Post , and many other outlets. A White House official says \"most\" of these 78 attacks since 2014 have not received enough attention from media. pic.twitter.com/v66rcHxAFI Source: Dan Merica on Twitter \nEven more absurdly, the White House also names the 2015 terror attacks in France as an incident that the media didn't adequately cover. This is downright preposterous. The Paris attacks were one of the biggest news stories of the year, and received substantial, continuous coverage in the press. The New York Times , the Wall Street Journal , NBC News , TIME , BuzzFeed , USA TODAY , and the Huffington Post all devoted serious coverage to the attacks â€” as did just about every news outlet in existence. So WH list is out & includes series of terror attacks widely covered by us and others: Paris, Nice, San Bernardino, Brussels, Istanbul.
