Despite that claim, recent arrests by ICE suggest that the new guidelines are being used to sweep up some DACA recipients.", "external_links": ["http://fusion.net/story/339273/trump-immigration-detention-centers-never-heard-of/", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/us/politics/dhs-immigration-trump.html", "https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/834080488855916550", "https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/02/21/secretary-kelly-issues-implementation-memoranda-border-security-and-interior", "http://www.npr.org/2016/08/31/492096565/fact-check-donald-trumps-speech-on-immigration", "https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/executive-order-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement-improvements"], "published": "2017-02-22T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:21:15.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
