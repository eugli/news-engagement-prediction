She asked whether they thought it was too short “because I’m fat”, and said the umpire responded, “Yes, we’re deducting two points”.\n“I’ve worn the same size uniform for 22 years, not once have they said anything to me,” Rachael told the Brisbane Times .\n“But that whole quarter I was crying on court.”\nIn a Facebook post on the Brisbane Netball Association’s Facebook page, Rachael questioned the decision.\nWhile she received a heap of support on her post, her post was reportedly deleted from the Netball Association’s official page.\nHowever, its response to Rachael is still public on its page.\n“Hi Rachael, we are very sorry that this situation has occurred and made you feel this way,” the post reads. “It is not the intention of our policy to make people feel badly about themselves, the purpose is to protect and prevent adolescent girls from wearing inappropriate uniforms.\n“Can you please write down a complete version of the events and email it to admin@brisbanenetball.org.au. We will then forward it on to our complaints tribunal.\n“As per our policy, all complaints of this nature are sent straight to an independent tribunal to be investigated. Thank you for bringing this to our attention, we look forward to receiving your email.”\nRachael's netball skirt was deemed “too short”. Source: Supplied \n“Ms Rachael Brown was flagged by officials for allegedly not complying to Section 14E, which states: ‘Uniform dresses must be of sufficient length to fall below the level of uniform bike pants when a player is in a normal standing position’,” an official from the Brisbane Netball Association said.\n“These rules were introduced in 2012 following feedback from parents to protect adolescent girls from wearing inappropriate uniforms that infringe privacy. Netball is an inclusive game which encourages participation by women of all backgrounds, fitness levels and sizes.”\n“Following the independent tribunal to address this matter, we hope to see Ms Brown back on a BNA court in future.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:04:34.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
