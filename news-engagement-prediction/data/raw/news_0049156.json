Tony Briscoe .\nSunday capped a record-setting weekend. On Friday and Saturday, highs of 67 and 70 degrees, respectively, set new benchmarks for temperatures recorded at O'Hare International Airport. Saturday's high was the third-highest temperature recorded during the month of February while Sunday's ranked fifth, National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Friedlein said. \n\"We have had anomalous temperatures before in February, but they are still very rare,\" he said. \nThe highest temperature on record for this month is 75 degrees on Feb. 27, 1976. \nSo far this February, the first 19 days of the month on average have been warmer than the first 19 days of last March. Typically, temperatures hover around the mid-30s this time of year, Friedlein said. The unusually warm weather has been due, in part, to the lack of snow this season combined with warm air masses from the southwest U.S., he said \n\"Snow cover acts like a freezer,\" Friedlein said. \"And there hasn't really been much since prior to Christmas.\" \nForecasts made Sunday for upcoming days showed that daily temperature records could stay intact. But the city will have a chance Monday to tie a record for the most consecutive days in February with temperatures above 60 degrees â€” four.
