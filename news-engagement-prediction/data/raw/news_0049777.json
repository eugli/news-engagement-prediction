The facility is not yet completed, as constructions of buildings and parklands will continue through the summer, but by April enough will be done to begin hosting employees for work.\nDesigned in collaboration with Foster + Partners, Apple Park replaces 5 million square feet of asphalt and concrete with grassy fields, along with over 9,000 drought-resistant, California-native trees.\nThere will be two miles of walking and running paths for employees, plus an orchard, meadow, and pond, all found within the inside of the massive ring.\nIt will also be powered by 100 percent renewable energy, featuring 17 megawatts of rooftop solar, making it one of the largest on-site solar energy installations in the world.\nApple said its new facility will also be the world's largest naturally ventilated building, projected to require no heating or air conditioning for nine months of the year.\nThe building will feature a visitors center with an Apple Store and a cafe open to the public. It will also be home to a 100,000-square-foot fitness center for employees, and a \"secure research and development center.\"\nPerhaps the centerpiece of it all, however, will be a theater named for company cofounder Steve Jobs. The 1,000-seat auditorium is situated atop a hill overlooking meadows and the main building, in honor of the company's former chief executive.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:13:22.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
