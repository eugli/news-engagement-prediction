(Photo: Nick Oza/The Republic) \nNOGALES, Sonora — Jesus Ontiveros blows into his hands , rubbing them together. \nIt's 34 degrees on a recent morning. Large tarps that cover a wire fence surrounding the comedor, or mess hall, keep out the wind but not the cold, as Ontiveros waits for his first meal of the day — and his first since being sent back to Mexico. \nAll he has to keep warm is a light sweater and a scarf, which he proceeds to wrap around his neck. \nAfter Ontiveros spent 20 days in detention, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers dropped him off in Nogales, Sonora, across the border from Nogales, Ariz., and about 780 miles from his hometown of Durango. With practically no resources or belongings, Ontiveros turned to the Kino Border Initiative's Aid Center for Deported Migrants, where he joined 40 men and women in similar circumstances. Colleges brace to shield students from immigration raids \nOntiveros had worked as a painter in Mesa, Ariz., sending money back to his family. \n\"I was working when one of my co-workers called Border Patrol,\" he says, slightly shivering. \"They arrived at work and that's why they deported me. Otherwise, I'd be there still.\" \nHe doesn't know yet how long he'll stay in Nogales, but he's waiting on his family to send him money to return to Durango. \nKino Border Initiative's Aid Center has managed to care for the people deported from the United States, a decreasing number in recent years. But Ontiveros could be the beginning of a new surge. President Trump has vowed to deport some 2 million to 3 million immigrants with criminal backgrounds, and he signed executive actions last month that set the table for increased removals. Trump plans to ramp up deportations \nIn response, border cities and migrant groups from Tijuana to Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas, are sounding the alarm and asking for assistance to deal with an expected spike in the number of deported individuals arriving in their cities. \nMigrants talk with Catholic bishops at the Kino Border Initiative's Aid Center in Nogales, Sonora, in March 2014. (Photo: Michael Chow/The Republic) Not unprecedented \n​A significant increase in deportations would not be unprecedented for cities on the Mexico side of the nearly 2,000-mile-long border with the U.S. \nIn 2009, faith-based groups in Arizona and Sonora founded the Kino Border Initiative in response to a growing need for humanitarian services in the Nogales border region. “We may have to serve more people. Obviously, we will do that if we have to, but hopefully that won't be necessary.” Father Sean Carroll \nThen-President Obama had ramped up deportations that overwhelmed Mexican authorities and migrant groups. At one point, up to 700 people a day arrived in Nogales alone, according to local authorities. \nObama deported approximately 2 million people during his eight years in office, more than any other president. Critics gave him the nickname \"Deporter in Chief.\" \nFather Sean Carroll, the initiative's director, said they saw a large, steady flow of people coming to the center, which at that time served nearly 230 meals daily. \nToday, the center serves about 100 to 120 meals per day. The center also provides clothing and referral services for people who have been deported, and the initiative operates a shelter for women and children. \n\"We may have to serve more people,\" Carroll said about a possible increase under Trump. \"Obviously, we will do that if we have to, but hopefully that won't be necessary.\" Deportations not the only concern \nAlthough shelters have dealt with the issue before, cities along the U.S.-Mexico border face additional challenges that could affect their ability to handle any increase in deportees. \nShelters in the Tijuana area — by far the main point of entry for Mexican deportees — have been operating at above capacity for months. That's largely due to the arrival of thousands of Haitian migrants who are now stuck at the border, unable to turn themselves in to U.S. authorities. (After temporarily suspending deportations to Haiti, the U.S. resumed deporting Haitians in November.) \nOne Tijuana shelter, Casa Madre Assunta, which has capacity for 44 people, houses about 80, mostly Haitians. \n\"We've had to convert spaces we hadn't considered before so they can sleep in them, and we'll have to continue using these spaces for these people,\" Sister Salome Limas said. \"Right now, we have a multiuse hall that we've had to convert to a dormitory.\" \nAs a result, operating costs for the shelter, run by the the Missionary Sisters of St. Charles Borromeo-Scalabrinians, have almost tripled, she said, amid rising prices for food and gas, coupled with a sluggish economy. \nWith little government support, many of these migrant shelters along the border, which are mainly run by faith groups, are dependent on handouts and community donations. \nBut even that's dried up recently, as Mexican residents grapple with a weak peso and rising inflation. In many cases, the shelters are now left to do more with a lot less money. \n\"Before, a kilo of tortillas would cost us between 10 and 12 pesos, now it's 15 pesos,\" Juan Sierra said. He helps refer newly deported migrants to one of two Catholic shelters in the Reynosa-Matamoros border area, the busy transit corridor just across from Texas' Rio Grande Valley. Jeff Sessions, a deficit hawk, may need to spend big on immigration \nAlong that part of the border, it's not Haitian migrants, but Central American men, women and children seeking asylum in the United States. \nShelters there may not be at full capacity, at least all the time, but Sierra said many of these migrants end up staying for longer periods, driving up costs. \n\"The problem is that many people get here and they're unable to leave right away,\" he said. \"When a person stays for longer than a week, it affects us, the costs multiply ... we have to feed and house that person, and then we have someone else waiting at the door.\" \nLimas said they have a similar problem in Tijuana, and the arrival of more deportees would make the situation much worse. They have begun looking at ways to free up shelter space, just in case. \n\"What we've talked about doing, is to talk to some of the people who want to fix their documents to stay here legally, the foreigners, but they have to make that choice,\" she said. \"If they no longer plan on going (to the U.S.), then they'd be here like any other migrant and we give them 15 days (to stay).\" Facebook Posted!

There has been a sharp rise in the number of Central American migrants, including many families and unaccompanied minors, that is on par with the surge in 2014. Most enter in the Rio Grande Valley of South Texas but other areas of the border are also seeing spikes in Central American migrants, including around Yuma, Arizona and El Paso, Texas.
