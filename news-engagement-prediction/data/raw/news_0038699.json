And even if he had some special powers, some abilities that he had developed, the fact that he was saying he could teach other people to master them, it just sounded like people were gonna die,” Scott told Hack . \n“I came to this project with the intention of debunking him, I was so skeptical. \nHe was saying things that I thought were crazy.” From skeptic to convert \nAssuming he was about to uncover another juicy journalistic scoop, Scott visited Wim Hof in Poland. \n“But it turns out, after I went to Poland, after I started learning his techniques...I ended up sort of duplicating what he was able to do,” Scott says. \nScott ended up writing a completely different book: What Doesn't Kill Us. \nThe first exercise was to stand barefoot in the snow. \n“This is the winter that stopped the Nazi army, this is really cold stuff,” Scott says. \n“The arteries and the veins in my feet constricted, that’s the natural response to sort of shove the blood back up to my core. My body was in panic mode.” \nOn that first day, Scott lasted about five minutes before his feet couldn't take it anymore. \n“The next day, and this is what’s really interesting, that level of pain didn’t set in for ten minutes. I had doubled the amount of time I could stand in the snow by the next day. \n“The day after that, it was like half an hour, and by the end of the week it was an hour. Then I was lying in it, then I meditated on the rocks in this icy river, and I melted all the snow around me with my body heat. It was amazing, that progress. \n“It was just so eye-opening, that I had this power, that in just a week’s time I was thriving in the snow. I ended up climbing up a mountain in Poland, in about eight hours in 2 degrees [-16 degrees celsius]... in my bathing suit and hiking boots.” \nWim Hof, Scott Carney and other trainees sit on the banks of the river until the snow melts around them in Poland. \nPhoto by Jeremy Liebman.

His techniques come under three “powerful pillars”: a special breathing technique much like hyperventilating; cold therapy (subjecting yourself to extremely cold temperatures); and “commitment”. \nAfter months of environmental training, Scott, Wim Hof and a few dozen others set their sights on an epic challenge: climbing Mt Kilimanjaro. \nThe recommended time for climbers to ascend the African mountain is five to ten days due to the extreme altitude and cold weather, and even then climbers die every year from altitude sickness. It can get down to about -30 degrees celsius. \nScott Carney and Wim Hof were taking a different approach to typical Kilimanjaro climbers: they wanted to ascend in less than two days, and do it all in their swimmers. \nThe US military said they were almost guaranteed to come down with acute mountain sickness, which can prove fatal. \nMeanwhile, the Dutch Mountaineering Association predicted that Hof’s climbing group were climbing to their graves. \n“They gave us a 100 per cent chance of fatality,” Scott says. \nAfter 28 hours, they all made it to the top of Mt Kilimanjaro - except for two climbers in the group who came down with acute mountain sickness. \nScott Carney, Wim Hof and Dennis Bernaerts at Gilman's Point on Mount Kilimajaro. \nSupplied by Scribe Publications. What’s the point? \nScott claims that once he began exercising differently - not more, but with a different breathing technique and in colder conditions - he was able to lose more weight. \nHe also says that extreme temperatures activate muscles that humans rarely use - now that we have comfortable heating in the winter and air conditioning in the summer (if you’re lucky). \n“There’s lots and lots of benefits to it,” Scott says, “But let’s just look for a moment at that initial response I had [when I was barefoot in the snow] which was vascular constriction. \n“Your natural response, your naive response to extreme temperatures is to constrict and all the blood comes to your core. And the reason you’re able to do that is because you have all these muscles lining your vasculature. \n“It’s just some sort of innate survival response. But most humans, who never experience cold, we never use those muscles - because there’s no way to consciously activate them. \n“That’s one of the reasons why it was so darn painful. And just going into the snow exercises your cardiovascular systems. It’s like lifting weights for the thousands of miles of tubing you have in your body.” \nScott Carney. \nPhoto by Laura Krantz. Supplied by Scribe Publications. It still sounds pretty crazy to me… \nLying naked in the snow? Connecting with our primal, ancestral roots? Losing weight by hiking in your togs? \nWim Hof’s theories and techniques all sound very glamorous. \nBut should Scott Carney have remained a skeptic? \nFor one, the warning printed in the front of Scott’s book doesn’t fill you with a lot of hope about what you’re about to read. \nDr Tony Bartone, Vice President of the Australian Medical Association, warns that taking up Wim Hof’s techniques could be extremely dangerous. \n“Hypothermia is a very very lethal condition. Subjecting yourself to that kind of conditioning would be risking a number of potential body organs failing or shutting down,” Dr Bartone told Hack . \n“Even if you are physically fit and endowed, you would be really challenging your cardiovascular system, your heart, and your rhythm centres of your heart in particular. The circulation to the extremities would obviously be questionable. \nI would not recommend that for anybody to do it without a really good reason. \n\"And that reason would have to have a considerable amount of assurance that there would be monitoring going on at that time, that the person would have a full range of physicals, and that the appropriate safety guards were in place. \n“I certainly wouldn’t recommend it to any of my average patients.” Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T09:00:42.580+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
