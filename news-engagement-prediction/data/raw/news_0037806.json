It's not a fair question,\" Trump said, interrupting Turx mid-sentence. \"Okay, sit down. I understand the rest of your question.\"\n\"I am the least anti-Semitic person you have ever seen in your entire life,\" Trump added. \"I am the least racist person.\"\nTurx tried to follow up on his original question, but he was rebuffed each time with an order to be \"quiet.\"\n\"See? He lied about he was going to get up and ask a very straight and simple question. So, you know, welcome to the world of the media,\" Trump said. \"I hate the charge. I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people who know me, and you heard [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] yesterday … he said, 'I've known Donald Trump for a long time,' and then he said, 'Forget it.'\"\n\"So you should take that instead of having to get up to ask a very insulting question like that,\" he added.\nTurx, for his part, maintains that he in no way meant to imply that Trump was responsible for the uptick in anti-Semitism. Rather, he meant only to ask the president for his thoughts on the matter.\n\" President Trump clearly misunderstood my question. This is highly regretful and I'm going to seek clarification,\" Turx said later on social media .\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Reports: Robert Harward turns down Trump's offer of national security adviser The president is trying to woo the retired military officer into joining his administration.\nBy Anna Giaritelli • 02/16/17 6:29 PM The sad thing is that this was plainly evident from Turx's questioning. It'd do the president some good to listen more closely next time, and to resist the urge to assume the intentions of others.\nTop Story President Trump unleashed Trump's aggressive stance toward the media and freewheeling campaign style is back.\nBy Sarah Westwood • 02/16/17 1:18  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:44:19.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
