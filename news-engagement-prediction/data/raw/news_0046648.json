Mac and his lover, Nathan’s fiancee Lisa Loveday, were on the scene when Nathan fell to his death and so far, have managed to keep the truth under wraps. \nBut as emotions run high and grief takes its toll, what discoveries are about to be made by the shattered family? \nIt’s a heavy day for all involved, with Marnie an absolute wreck over her loss and Mac consumed both by his feelings of loss and guilt. Marnie’s mum Tabby returns to support her daughter but as the day of the ceremony arrives, Marnie is unable to hold it together. (Picture: Lime Pictures) \nMac watches on, feeling terrible, as Marnie breaks down by her son’s coffin and as those who loved Nathan say their goodbyes, a dramatic turn of events may be about to reveal the circumstances around his death.

If the truth about what he did were to come out, Mac would likely be exiled from the clan. (Picture: Lime Pictures) \nIt remains to be seen exactly what plays out but a grief stricken Marnie is about to take drastic action that could have far reaching consequences… \nOne to watch: Friday 24th February at 7pm on E4.
