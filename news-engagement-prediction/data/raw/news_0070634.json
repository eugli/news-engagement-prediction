They will then condense the pool of pitches by March 20.\nThe second phase would require the remaining contractors to fulfill the full proposal request and provide the potential price.\nMore than one group is expected to be awarded the contract for the wall that could potentially cover nearly 2,000 miles. Winners will likely be announced in mid-April.\nThe wall will fulfill Trump's campaign promise/slogan to build a border wall with Mexico, which he purports would stem illegal immigration and support his drug enforcement policies.\nTrump first mentioned the wall during his June 2015 presidential announcement speech, and he often brought it up during his campaign rallies. The president brought it up again during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday.\n\"We've defended other nations' borders while leaving ours wide open, anybody can come in,\" Trump said. \"We're going to build a wall, don't worry about it. We're building the wall, we're building the wall. In fact, it's going to start soon. Way ahead of schedule, way ahead of schedule.\"\nDespite Trump's claims, according to the announcement, Homeland Security is still looking for ideas to build the wall and its potential cost.\nTrump has also alleged that the Mexican government will pay for the border wall, which is expected to cost billions of dollars. Mexican officials have rebuffed claims that their country would pay for any construction costs, and the White House has floated the idea of a 20 percent tax on imports to cover costs.\nThe Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:21:23.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
