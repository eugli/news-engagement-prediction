Trump may have stumbled on an effective scheme for reviving flagging Mexican interest in seeking economic opportunity in the United States. And he seems to have hit on a brilliant stimulus for building underground financial markets.\nTrump is already spurring international language skills, having inspired former Mexican President Vicente Fox to fluent English profanity. \"I'm not going to pay for that fucking, wall,\" said the former head of state, who is the grandson of an American who crossed the border to find opportunity in Mexico.\nTypically, Trump doesn't plan to leave the choice in Mexican hands. In a memo to the Washington Post , he laid out his proposal that \"no alien may wire money outside of the United States unless the alien first provides a document establishing his lawful presence in the United States.\" That is, he wants to impose targeted capital controls on the flow of cash from the U.S. to Mexico.\n\"We have the moral high ground here, and all the leverage,\" adds Trump. \"It is time we use it in order to Make America Great Again.\"\nThe \"moral high ground\" claim is questionable, considering that would-be President Trump asserts state dominion over people's money, telling them where and to whom they send cash they earned and own. And there's actually less leverage to be had than in the past. Just as the years since the great recession have seen a net outflow of Mexicans from the United States—Trump's wall looks destined to inconvenience more people trying to leave than enter—so remittances south of the border have also plummeted , by 29 percent between 2006 and 2013.\nBut we're still talking about an estimated $24 billion. That's a lot of leverage with which to convince Mexico to keep home people who are no longer so eager to come here anyway. That sort of persuasion might be effective when we consider that every dollar remitted back home may generate as much as $1.70 in economic activity, according to researchers . But that leverage will be effective in a perverse way. Tell Mexicans working in the U.S. that they can't send the money they've earned back home where it's used to pay bills, start businesses, and fuel the prosperity that has kept Mexicans home in recent years and there's a fair chance that more of the people currently in Mexico will have to seek opportunity elsewhere.\nLike in the United States.\nOr maybe they won't. Capital controls aren't new, and people around the world have grown proficient at making sure their money gets from Point A to Point B, no matter what the Donald Trumps of the world say.\nOne possible workaround is that migrants could smuggle—or pay somebody else (think criminal networks) to smuggle—physical cash back to Mexico. That's a bit risky and crude, though, to the point that elegant alternatives have existed for centuries.\n\"Migrant workers can also send money home via transfer systems, like the hawala system in the Middle East and India, that use a series of brokers to transfer money without having to physically send it abroad,\" notes Vox.com's Dara Lind.\nBut technology has cleared the way for even easier transmission of money, Lind adds. \"In Africa, for example, where transaction fees on remittances tend to be highest (13 percent of remittances get eaten up in fees), people have started sending money directly by cellphone for much lower fees than banks charge.\"\nOr people could game Trump's restrictions by bypassing the strict letter of the rules.\n\"The most obvious way around the new provision would be for those who can prove legal residency to send the money for those who cannot,\" writes Mary Anastasia O'Grady for the Wall Street Journal . \"But wire transfers are only one way of moving money. It could also be deposited in a U.S. bank and withdrawn from automatic teller machines in Mexico by intended recipients.\"\nAnd even higher-tech workarounds are available to people committed to controlling and using their money as they please. In 2013, the Adam Smith Institute's Tim Worstall marveled at Forbes that \"Bitcoin was a great way to beat such attempts to limit your freedom to move your money where you want it to be.\"\nSure enough, it wasn't long before a growing number of people in places including Argentina and China were using the relatively anonymous and difficult to track digital currency to evade capital controls and bogus official exchange rates.\n\"Argentines are conducting an ambitious experiment, one that threatens ultimately to spread to the United States and disrupt some of the most basic services its banks have to offer,\" The New York Times cautioned .\nMaybe the fastest growth in the United States will take place among Spanish-speakers.\nPhoto Credit: elycefeliz/flickr", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:21:53.364+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
