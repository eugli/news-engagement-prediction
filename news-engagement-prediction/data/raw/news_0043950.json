Most of its healing powers come from its active compound – curcumin, and more than 7,000 studies have proven its numerous benefits to our health. So, drinking a turmeric water is one of the best things you can do for your health and body.\nA woman from Bristol, England has drunk this healthy beverage for one year, so in this post, we share her story by telling you all the things she experienced during this period.\nSome of the health benefits she received from drinking turmeric water in the morning for a year are alkaline pH’s levels of her body, relieved arthritis symptoms, and improved digestion.\nBut first, let’s explain how to make this turmeric water: add a teaspoon of ground turmeric and a pinch of black pepper in a glass of warm water. Stir well and drink while warm. Drink this beverage in the morning, and you’ll soon feel the same health benefits the woman from Bristol did. Here are some of the benefits you’ll get by drinking this beverage in the morning for 12 months:\n1. Improved Heart Health\nCurcumin, turmeric’s active compound, removes plaque from blood vessels, thus preventing blood clots from appearing. The journal Biological and Pharmaceutical Bulletin has published a 2011 study conducted by researchers at the Niigata University of Pharmacy and Applied Life Sciences in Japan, claiming that consuming turmeric for 21 days has improved the heart condition in male rats.\n2. Reversed Type 2 Diabetes\nConsuming turmeric can help reduce your high blood sugar levels, according to a 2009 study conducted at the Auburn University and published in the Biochemistry and Biophysical Research Communications.\n3. Alkaline pH levels\nHaving an alkaline environment in your body is of crucial importance as cancer cells thrive only in an acidic environment. So, since turmeric can alkalize your body, it helps prevent and treat cancer.\n4. Prevention of Brain Disorders\nResearchers explain that low levels of the protein and growth hormone BDNF – Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, is often linked to dementia and Alzheimer’s. Since turmeric’s active compound controls the levels of BDNF, it protects the brain by preventing age-related brain diseases and conditions.\n5. Reduced Inflammation\nInflammation is the culprit of many diseases, but curcumin has the ability to fight against it thanks to its potent anti-inflammatory properties. In this way, curcumin or turmeric protect your body against inflammation-related diseases and conditions.\n6. Anti-Cancer Properties\nTurmeric, or more exactly its active compound, contains powerful antioxidant content which protects cells from free radical damage. Since this type of cell damage is the main cause of developing cancer cells, turmeric is one of the most powerful anti-cancer agents .\n7. Reduced Symptoms of Arthritis\nA 2012 study has proven that curcumin is equally effective as NSAIDs in treating pain and swelling related to arthritis, and even more effective than Diclofenac.\n8. Improved Digestion\nAnother proven benefit from consuming turmeric is improved digestion.\n9. Liver Protection\nTurmeric is beneficial to liver’s health since it protects it from damage caused by a variety of toxins, and regenerates cells which are already damaged. Moreover, it promotes a proper function of the gallbladder.\n10.Reduced Aging Process and Promotion of Longevity\nThis is due to its powerful antioxidant content and its ability to destroy free radicals and protect against inflammation.\nVia Healthy Food House | Positive Med | Top Healthy Life Advices\nRELATED POSTS Let’s block ads!
