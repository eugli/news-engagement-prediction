Does that sound fun to you?\nYou're in luck! One Wichita, Kansas, chiropractor is developing a labial glue stick that would enable people with periods to do just that. Forbes reported Monday that Mensez Technologies CEO and president Daniel Dopps, who is not a medical doctor but is taking a leap into what should probably remain the exclusive realm of gynecologists, has patented what he calls a \" feminine lipstick .\"\nWhen rubbed on the labia minora, the product's \"proprietary combination of amino acids and natural oils\" allegedly seals them together until the user pees. That dissolves the seal \"and everything washes away into the toilet.\"\nMensez \"feminine lipstick\" would seal the labia together so that no period blood can escape. Source: Mensez Technologies/Mensez.com The Mensez \"feminine lipstick\" is purportedly \"safe and secure for the user,\" but the product is still under development. \"We're just introducing the concept,\" Dopps told Forbes .\nWhen Mensez introduced the concept to the internet, it was met with a flood of ridicule. One Facebook user shared screenshots from Mensez' page on Monday, prompting at least one commenter to wonder whether \"this 'doctor' has ever actually seen a vagina before?\"\nOne of Mensez's posts asked: \"Have you ever woke up with your lips stuck together? It didn't hurt and it was kind of fun.\"\n\"GUYS LOVE TO KISS LIPSTICK,\" reads another, while another post from Mensez seems to chastise women for not having thought of this genius invention earlier:\nYes, I am a man and you as a woman should have come up with a better solution then diapers and plugs, but you didn't. Reason being women are focused on and distracted by your period 25% of the time, making them far less productive then they should be.", "external_links": ["http://mensez.com/", "http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=9539077.PN.&OS=PN/9539077&RS=PN/9539077", "https://www.facebook.com/nik.peter/posts/10155028483766660", "http://www.forbes.com/sites/kavinsenapathy/2017/02/20/male-chiropractor-wants-women-to-glue-labia-shut-with-lipstick-to-contain-menstrual-flow/#581b20d5a7b4", "https://www.facebook.com/nik.peter/posts/10155028483766660&quot;"], "published": "2017-02-22T00:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:21:04.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
