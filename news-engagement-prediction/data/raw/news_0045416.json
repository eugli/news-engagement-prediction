Such steps were denounced by regime opponents as a ploy to cement the Aliyev family’s dynastic rule. \nAzerbaijan’s embattled opposition angrily criticised Aliyeva’s elevation as undemocratic. \n“The move throws Azerbaijan back to medieval, feudal times,” Opposition leader Isa Gambar of Musavat party told AFP. \n“Family rule has no place in the 21st century,” he added. \nFirst lady of fashion \nKnown for her lavish tastes, Ms. Aliyeva featured prominently in U.S. diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks, one of which dubbed her “a first lady, too, in fashion”. \n“First Lady Mehriban Aliyeva appears to have had substantial cosmetic surgery, presumably overseas, and wears dresses that would be considered provocative even in the Western world,” the leaked 2010 cable said. \nAn eye doctor by training, she has also authored a dissertation on the ethical aspects of mercy killing. \nThe Aliyevs have two socialite daughters Leyla, 32, and Arzu, 27, a student son, Heydar, 19, and four grandchildren. \nThe President, 55, cruised to a third five-year term against limited opposition in 2013, extending his family’s rule into a third decade. \nSupporters have praised the Aliyevs for turning a republic once considered a Soviet backwater into a flourishing energy supplier to Europe. \nBut critics argue they have crushed all opposition and used their power to amass a fortune that funds a lavish lifestyle for the President and his family. \nActivists have raised concerns over Azerbaijan’s poor rights record, with Human Rights Watch in May 2015 blasting the country for a ruthless crackdown that has seen political activists and critical journalists jailed. \n“President Ilham Aliyev is the person most responsible for Azerbaijan’s appalling human rights record of the last decade,” Freedom House, a pro-democracy watchdog, has said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:59:09.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
