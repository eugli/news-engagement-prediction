Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA glamorous airline pilot is taking her Instagram followers around the world with her by posting incredible snaps of the exotic locations she is paid to fly to. \nEser Aksan Erdogan has amassed a legion of fans after sharing selfies of herself in the cockpit of the Pegasus Airlines passenger jet s she flies, and stunning photos from the exotic destinations she visits for work and holiday. \nThe 31-year-old's shots offer a revealing look at the lives of jet-setting pilots and their down time - showing her relaxing at five-star hotels, sailing in the Mediterranean or exploring the world's wonders. \nShe has seen the Northern Lights, been on safari in Tanzania and landed in Saudi Arabia with an all-female flight crew, where women are banned from driving. \nAnd the adventurous pilot hopes more women will join the mainly male-dominated industry. \nEser began posting photos after she started flying three years ago, and now has more than 28,000 followers.

I was kind of a tomboy so I always wanted to fly an F16, but since I'm against war, violence and armies, flying big jets is so much better. \n\"The eternal blue of the sky, fluffy clouds and the ability to visit countries far, far away have always had a big attraction on me.

The job has plenty of perks and challenges (Photo: Instagram/echosierra85) The pilot had the best seat while flying over snow-capped mountains in Turkey (Photo: Instagram/echosierra85) \nShe said: \"It's really hard work and you have to be prepared to study a lifetime. Be prepared for hard weather conditions, red-eye flights, very long duty hours up to a maximum of 14 to 16 hours and a lot of hotel rooms.
