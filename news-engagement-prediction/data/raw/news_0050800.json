Rec Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports More than two weeks after Super Bowl LI, nobody has seen Tom Brady’s jersey and the search is still on. The hunt for the presumably stolen jersey is pretty serious too, with the Houston Police Department valuing the piece of memorabilia at $500,000 in a police report obtained by TMZ . While Brady has been to six other Super Bowls and the win over the Atlanta Falcons earned him a fifth championship ring, the missing jersey hasn’t been treated as just another piece of memorabilia for the quarterback. Patriots owner Robert Kraft compared the heist to “taking a great Chagall or Picasso.” Two years ago, a Picasso sold for $179.4 million and in 2010 a Chagall sold for $4.18 million . Art sales have slumped a bit recently , but if Brady’s jersey is worth $500,000, maybe that’s a bit of an exaggeration by Kraft. An interesting note in the police report, as pointed out by TMZ, is that the case is being investigated by Houston P.D.’s police impersonation and swindle squads in the Major Offenders Division. One day after the jersey went missing, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick promised to have the Texas Rangers help with the search. But maybe, like Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said , they’re more worried about things like — oh, I don’t know — homicides, instead of a jersey. Let’s all hope they solve the case so our long national nightmare of the missing jersey can finally come to an end.
