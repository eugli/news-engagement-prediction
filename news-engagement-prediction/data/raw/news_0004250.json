Directed by Garth Davis, Lion has been nominated in seven categories at the 89th Academy Awards. Suhani Singh | Posted by Devarsi Ghosh A + A - Priyanka Bose (L) and in the film Lion \nChild actor Sunny Pawar has been earning plaudits for his work in Lion. But he isn't the only Indian cast member to get recognition for his performance. Priyanka Bose essays Kamla, the biological mother of Saroo Brierley, the Australia-based Indian who used Google Earth to find his family in Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh. The actor who has starred in Gulaab Gang and was a member of the powerful play Nirbhaya, talks about playing a grief-stricken mother in Lion, drawing comparisons with Slumdog Millionaire and future projects. \nFULL LIST OF OSCAR NOMINATIONS AT THE 89TH ACADEMY AWARDS \nHow did you get the prominent part in Lion? \nTess Joseph (casting director) and I have known each other for a little while. Sold was the first film she cast me in. But Lion was serendipitous. I had known about the story. And when she called me to narrate it and put me on tape, I had feeling I could do justice to it. Not every day I have had the pleasure of reading such an amazing script. And because it was a true story, the process involved immersing my entire being into it. Tess put me on tape and shared the script with me before I met Garth Davis. After a couple of months I was in Australia working on the part with him. \nTell us about Kamla. She is a single parent who has gone through her worst nightmare. \nKamla is a strong person. She raised four children as a single mother and in a village where this wasn't possible. The family didn't come from any higher means at all. Then to lose both her children in one night. It's not something you'd think anyone could survive. But she did. I guess the only thing that made her believe in each day is because she somehow knew Saroo was alive. It sounds crazy, but it is really that simple. In that night she lost them both, she found her older son's body and not Saroo's. So she knew that he was alive and persevering each day, just as she was. I channelled it with great despair of loss and also my maternal instincts. I listened to the material that Garth had, and managed to do enough research of my own. \nDid you get to meet Kamla? \nYes, It was very poetic. \nWATCH Lion Trailer \nSaroo is played by two actors - Sunny Pawar and Dev Patel. You had to age over two decades for the film. What was that process like? \nIt was exhilarating. I was so scared primarily because there was an urgency to do justice to their story. I wasn't waiting to be saved by Garth or the crew's greatness. I had to do this on my own and I had the trust invested in me from day one and that was a relief. Because without trust we'd be nothing. When you see this film, this part of the story runs on their own orbit. The mother (Kamla) and Saroo's search (younger and older) are parallel to each other. So I had no pressure of the entire film or the cast at all. \nYour monologue in the play Nirbhaya was very affecting. You talk about protecting your own daughter. Did Priyanka - the mother inevitably seep in while playing Kamala? \nNirbhaya was truth. Truth is raw and not always appreciated. Lion is truth too, in a different way and has immense resonance. Yes, when I read the script I had to put myself in a dark place and then reach out physically to grab the light. I'm a mother, so yes channelling that comes naturally to me. \nAjay Devgn \nWhat was it like working with Garth Davis and a foreign crew? Is the process different from shooting an Indian film? \nWe shot in Madhya Pradesh in a village close to Saroo's village. Garth didn't want to shoot in the same location as he was aware that the crew and the story would attract a lot of unwanted attention. Foreign crews are all specialised crews and no one is out of place. It's different only because there's a certain decorum in the approach of every department. Our Indian line producers were amazing too. The best here. \nI have been in a lot of crews and some are less painful than most. Shooting in India is hard because of the sound and population around. But we do it anyway. And our films do well. \nSunny has been spreading a lot of sunshine in Los Angeles with his appearances on red carpet and TV shows. \nHe is a great casting choice. Such a natural yet very self-aware. Right now he is eight and kills it on the red carpet and all these talk shows. It's pretty cool. I remember when I was 8, I couldn't speak. Getting all dolled up for the red carpet still takes me a long time. But I do it. I wish I was half as effortless as Sunny. I wish him the best. I also hope he is filled up with a lot of education and still retains the vulnerability. That will protect his growth as an artist as well. Child actors get very affected very soon because of stardom. I don't wish that for him. \nWhat can audiences here in India expect from Lion? Many may look at it as another Slumdog Millionaire. \nSlumdog was a different tempo and filmmaking. I can see how everyone can compare. The diversity of the casting in both is similar. Well, in a way. But Lion also brings two continents together in the storytelling. Also culturally, I suppose. The tempo is so different. \nThe story is true unlike Slumdog. So the approach was different as well. It's not the same. Dev Patel, you see and feel. This story and its sentimentality will deeply resonate with everybody here. I'm eager to get feedback. Not as an actor, but as a human being. \nThe film is up for six Oscars. \nI'm not holding my breath for anything right now.. Have you seen the list? They are all so deserving. I'm just happy that it is being considered. \nWhat are you working on next? \nI just finished a film called AscharyaFuckit produced by Sa Re GA Ma. I know it sounds explicit and probably is. Rakkhosh is a thriller, directed by Abhijit Kokate, starring Sanjay Mishra and me. 2016 was all about trying something new so I did that. Lion is releasing in February here, and my year is busy so far. I'm not holding my breath for anything right. Trying to go with the flow and taking care of myself. My manager in Los Angeles is putting me in consideration for the right things, and when I do sign anything exciting, you will know. \n(The writer tweets as @suhani84 .) \nWATCH: Who won what at the 88th Academy Awards To get the latest entertainment news and gossip, follow us on Twitter @Showbiz_IT and Like us on facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
