The Today I am Muslim, Too rally united people in solidarity against Trump's executive order barring travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations from entering the United States. Though the order has been blocked by a federal appeals court , Trump reportedly has a revised travel ban order in the works. \nSimmons has a long history of activism involving everything from animal rights to marriage equality to honoring victims of the transatlantic slave trade. In 2015 Simmons penned an open letter to his former friend, Trump, after the then Republican presidential candidate hopeful called for a ban on Muslims entering the U.S . while on the campaign trail. \nIn the letter to Trump, Simmons wrote : \"My friends, both Muslims and Jews, are saying there are so many comparisons between your rap and Hitlerâs, and I cannot disagree with them, Donald. You canât possibly want your kids or your wife Melania (all of whom I know and respect) to live with that. You are a born leader, who is set to possibly win the nomination of your party, but donât compromise what I know is in your heart to do it. You are a generous, kind man who has built a career on negotiating deals where everybody wins. Now, you seem like a one-man wrecking ball willing to destroy our nationâs foundation of freedom.\" \nSimmons' Today, I Am A Muslim Too rally brought people together to protest Islamophobia, and the hashtag I Am A Muslim Too began trending on Twitter. Today, I Am A Muslim Too Thank you @UncleRUSH for standing up for your Muslim sisters and brothers. #IAmAMuslimToo #solidarity pic.twitter.com/YHWOgShgvT Source: Linda Sarsour on Twitter \n\"Believing that people are the same takes you a long way,\" Simmons told NBC News . \"I love doing this work. It's purposeful. It makes me happy.\" It's a beautiful day to stand with my brothers & sisters!
