The impasse engineered by the consecration of Rt. Rev. Peter Okpalaeke as Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Ahiara, Mbaise, took a dangerous dimension weekend, when angry youths sacked the Parish Priest of St. Peter’s Catholic Parish, Amano Obioha, Monsignor Cletus Ogu. \nVanguard gathered that the priest, a pro-Okpalaeke loyalist, is said to be preparing to celebrate his golden jubilee anniversary as a Catholic cleric. \nOne of the stories that made the rounds was that Monsignor Ogu was celebrating the scheduled Sunday Mass in the church, when some youths locked up the rectory. \nAn indigene of the area that spoke to Vanguard Tuesday on the issue, confirmed that “the ageing priest was busy with his sacerdotal assignment in the church, not knowing that some youths had locked the entrance into the parish house”. \nHowever, another version of the story had it that “hell was let loose when Monsignor Ogu attempted to gain entrance into the church for Sunday Mass, but was barred by angry youths. \nOn what led to the near ugly incident, some respondents accused Monsignor Ogu of being responsible for the transfer of his curate, who they claimed, “is loved by parishioners”. \nA priest, Rev. Dr. Jude Uwalaka, who confirmed the incident in a telephone chat, expressed regret that “Monsignor Ogu, who is constantly on drugs, was not even allowed to take his medicines and personal effects”. \nWhen Vanguard visited the parish Tuesday, some armed policemen were seen guarding the church, although they bluntly refused to speak on their mission. \n“We are not permitted to talk to the press please. You can approach the PPRO for everything you want to know about our presence in this church”, one of them said and moved away. \nWhen contacted on his mobile line, the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Mr. Andrew Enwerem, a deputy superintendent of police, confirmed the story. \n“Our men are in the church compound to ensure that peace reigns supreme in the area. We have no hand in the running of the Catholic Church. We are only aware that a priest was transferred to another parish and the people started protesting”, Enwerem said. \nOn whether any arrests were made, the PPRO said he was not aware of any arrest, reiterating that their principal mission was to forestall possible breakdown of law and order. \nIt will be recalled that since Okpalaeke was consecrated Bishop of Ahiara Diocese, a section of the Catholic faithful have consistently refused to allow him take charge of jurisdiction. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:09:58.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
