The six-point penalty effectively creates a ‘two strikes and you’re out’ policy because 12 points usually leads to a driving ban. The new penalties will be accompanied by a publicity blitz. ‘We are trying to change the culture,’ Mr Grayling told the Daily Mail. ‘It is a widespread problem. There is still a block of motorists who do this without thinking and it has got to stop. ‘We need people to start being a lot more disapproving – if you’re in a car and the driver starts using their phone then tell them to stop. ‘If you have got a handheld phone then stick it in the glove compartment. If it’s on the seat beside you, then turning it off is not a bad idea.’ The new penalties are a victory for the Mail’s End the Mobile Madness campaign. It was launched last year after a shocking string of fatal accidents involving motorists who were phoning, texting or checking social media while driving. Using a mobile phone at the wheel was outlawed a decade ago as evidence emerged of the impact it has on concentration. But the ban is widely flouted. Using a mobile phone at the wheel was outlawed a decade ago as evidence emerged of the impact it has on concentration The RAC says offending has reached epidemic proportions. A study by the motoring group found that a third of drivers had used a handheld phone to make a call while at the wheel. Half admitted they had used their phones in stationary traffic, which is also illegal. Mr Grayling said: ‘It is still the case if you drive around, time and again to see people with a mobile phone clamped to their ear. We need to get people thinking it is as unacceptable as drink-driving. ‘There is pressure for an immediate ban, and I don’t rule that out for the future if the message does not get through. ‘Many motorists still seem blasé about this, but it is simply not acceptable – it has got to stop.’ Critics claim that cuts to traffic police numbers mean that drivers can continue using their phones with impunity. Figures last year showed that the number of fines handed out has plummeted by 86 per cent over the past five years. Mr Grayling acknowledged using a mobile phone at the wheel in the past but said he would not consider doing it now. ‘If you go back 20 years, it wasn’t illegal, it was perfectly normal,’ he said. ‘Now people are aware of how dangerous it is. I wouldn’t dream of doing it now.’ ... BUT DRIVERS DON'T KNOW CRACKDOWN IS IMMINENT Two fifths of drivers are unaware they face tougher punishments for using a handheld mobile phone while driving. Thirty-nine per cent do not know that penalty points will go from three to six and fines double to £200 from Wednesday, according to a poll of 1,500 drivers. It also found that 30 per cent of drivers admit to using their phone behind the wheel and 54 per cent do not believe tougher punishments will work. ‘It is very worrying that a significant proportion of drivers are unaware of the changes given how significant they are,’ said James Hillon, of Co-op Insurance, which commissioned the survey. Jayne Willetts, of the Police Federation of England and Wales, welcomed the harsher punishments but called for all mobile use to be banned, even if it does not involve holding a device. ‘The wider issue of distraction should be addressed – the distraction of connecting to hands free, dialling a number,’ she said.
