China” policy, during a telephone call between the leaders, the Financial Times reports, citing two people familiar with the call.\nTrump, who was inaugurated last month, said in December the United States did not necessarily have to stick to the “one China” policy, by which Washington acknowledges China’s position that it has sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan.\nTRUMP LOSES TRAVEL BAN BID\nJudges involved in legal challenges against Trump’s immigration ban have come under threat prompting tighter security protection for them.\nCNN reported that while the specific threats are not known, law enforcement is treating them seriously. The US Marshals Service and local police have increased patrols and protective officers to provide security for some of the judges, officials said.\nSince Trump has taken office he has made verbal criticisms of judges — something that has sparked concern from former law enforcement officials and others.\nJust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 5, 2017 This comes as a federal appeals court in San Francisco has refused to reinstate Trump’s ban on travellers from seven predominantly Muslim nations.\nThe 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals wouldn’t block a lower-court ruling that suspended the ban and allowed previously barred travellers to enter the US. An appeal to the US Supreme Court is possible.\nUS District Judge James Robart in Seattle issued a temporary restraining order halting the ban last week after Washington state and Minnesota sued. The Justice Department appealed to the 9th Circuit.\nGovernment lawyers argued that the ban was a “lawful exercise” of the president’s authority and that the seven countries have raised terrorism concerns.\nThe states said Trump’s executive order unconstitutionally blocked entry based on religion.\nIt didn’t take long for Trump to make his thoughts on the ruling clear.\nSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 Hillary Clinton also seemed to weigh in on the situation, posting this cryptic tweet.\n3-0\n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 10, 2017 media_camera The US Appeals Court has ruled against President Donald Trump and his travel ban. Picture: AFP/MANDEL NGAN KELLYANNE SPRUIKS IVANKA’S LABEL\nTOP White House adviser Kellyanne Conway has been slammed for defending Ivanka Trump’s fashion company after a number of US retailers dumped the brand, citing falling sales.\nMs Conway told Fox & Friends on Thursday that Ms Trump is a “successful businesswoman” and people should give the company their business.\n“Go buy Ivanka’s stuff, is what I would tell you ... I’m going to give it a free commercial here: Go buy it today,” she said.\nA former top official under President Barack Obama has hit back, saying Ms Conway broke the law by telling people in the TV interview to buy Ms Trump’s clothes.\nChris Lu highlighted a law which says: “An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives.”\nThis is the federal ethics law that @KellyannePolls just violated\ncc: @OfficeGovEthics @jasoninthehouse pic.twitter.com/EivJeFd7wY\n— Chris Lu (@ChrisLu44) February 9, 2017 “This is the federal ethics law that @KellyannePolls just violated,” Mr Lu tweeted, tagging the US Office of Government Ethics and Republican Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\nIt comes after President Donald Trump launched a Twitter attack against Nordstrom when the retailer dropped his daughter’s clothing and accessory line.\nHis tweet, in which he said his daughter was treated “so unfairly” , drew swift criticism from ethics experts.\nMy daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom . She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 After the dust-up with Nordstrom, employees at US retailers TJ Maxx and Marshalls were told to throw away any signs advertising merchandise from Ms Trump’s retail brand, according to The New York Times .\n“Effective immediately, please remove all Ivanka Trump merchandise from features and mix into the runs,” read a note to workers obtained by the newspaper. “All Ivanka Trump signs should be discarded.”\nMr Trump has tweeted about companies such as Boeing, Carrier and General Motors. But ethics experts say this time is different because it involves a business run by his daughter — and that raises conflict-of-interest concerns.\nmedia_camera President Donald Trump lashed out at US retailer Nordstrom after it dumped his daughter Ivanka Trump’s clothing line. Picture: AP Photo/Evan Vucci POPE SEEMINGLY CALLS OUT TRUMP AGAIN\nPOPE Francis has delivered a thinly-veiled rebuke of Mr Trump’s plan to build a wall on the border with Mexico, saying society should not create “walls but bridges”.\nThe pontiff did not refer to the US president by name or directly mention the proposed wall, which Mr Trump has insisted Mexico will pay for.\nInstead the Argentinian pontiff used his weekly general audience on Wednesday to speak of a Christian calling “to not raise walls but bridges, to not respond to evil with evil, to overcome evil with good”.\nmedia_camera Pope Francis has rebuked Donald Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico. Picture: AP Photo/Andrew Medichini\nHe added: “A Christian can never say ‘I’ll make you pay for that’. Never! That is not a Christian gesture. An offence is overcome with forgiveness, by living in peace with everyone.”\nLast year, in response to an answer about then-candidate Mr Trump’s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall, Francis said a man with those views is “not Christian”.\nHe said in an interview last month that he would not form an opinion of Mr Trump until he first had a chance to see specific policies the new US president would implement.\nAs Mr Trump was taking office on January 20, Francis sent a message urging him to be guided by ethical values, saying he must take care of the poor and the outcast during his time in office.\nJEFF SESSIONS SWORN IN AS ATTORNEY GENERAL Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions has been sworn in as US Attorney General, despite protests from the likes of Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was formally silenced for impugning her senator colleague.\nDuring an Oval Office ceremony, Mr Trump called Senator Sessions a man of integrity and principal, and someone who has devoted his life to the cause of justice.\nSenator Sessions was sworn in the morning after the Senate confirmed his nomination following a contentious confirmation process. The Alabama lawmaker resigned his Senate seat shortly after his colleagues approved him on a 52-47 vote that broke largely along partisan lines.\nSen. Sessions was the first sitting US senator to endorse Mr Trump.\nHe faced criticism from Democrats, including Senator Warren, over his record on civil rights and immigration.\nmedia_camera US President Donald Trump (2nd R) watches as Jeff Sessions (L), alongside his wife Mary (2nd L), is sworn in as Attorney General by US Vice President Mike Pence. Picture: AFP\nRepublicans lauded his four decades of public service and his commitment to fairness and the rule of law.\nMeanwhile, just before the attorney general was sworn in, Mr Trump signed three executive actions related to criminal justice, including an order to have the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security to tackle “criminal cartels” that have spread across the nation.\nTrump announced the executive actions during a swearing-in ceremony for Attorney General Jeff Mr Trump says the plan will attempt to break the backs of criminal cartels. He’s also asking for a task force to reduce violent crime in America and a plan to stop violent crimes against law enforcement officers. He calls it a “shame” what has happened to “truly great” law enforcement officers.\nTRUMP GOES AFTER MCCAIN OVER YEMEN RAID Mr Trump is going after Republican Senator John McCain for suggesting that last week’s US raid in Yemen wasn’t a success .\nMr Trump tweeted on Thursday that Senator McCain “should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy!”\nHe added that Senator McCain has “been losing so long he doesn’t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in — bogged down in conflict all over the place.”\nSen.

Of the 50 US states, 35 count Canada as their leading export market.\nMr Trump has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.\nCanada’s foreign minister warned the Trump administration on Wednesday that his country will retaliate if the US applies new tariffs.\nSUPREME COURT NOMINEE: ‘BAN IS DEMORALISING’ Mr Trump has lashed out at a Democratic senator who revealed that the president’s own Supreme Court nominee had called Mr Trump’s attacks on the judiciary “disheartening” and “demoralising.”\nThe US president last week called a federal judge who temporarily blocked his travel ban a “so-called judge”, before saying the appellate court panel currently considering his executive order was “so political”.\nJudge Neil Gorsuch, nominated last week to fill a key vacancy on the Supreme Court, criticised Mr Trump’s stance during a meeting with Senator Richard Blumenthal. Mr Trump’s own confirmation team for Judge Gorsuch confirmed those comments.\nmedia_camera US Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch (right) meets with Senator Richard Blumenthal in Blumenthal's office in Washington, DC.

He served in the Marine Corps Reserves during Vietnam. He apologised in 2010, saying he regretted his misstatements.\nSen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?\n— Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 Republican former Senator Kelly Ayotte, who is helping with Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation, was at the meeting with the judge and Senator Blumenthal.\nShe issued a statement saying Judge Gorsuch made clear he was not referring to any specific case. But she said the nominee said he finds any criticism of a judge’s integrity and independence to be “disheartening and demoralising.”\nOn Thursday, Ms Conway said Mr Trump was “fully confident” in his Supreme Court nominee.\nGorsuch: Trump's Comments on Judiciary 'Demoralizing' 2:14 President Trump?s Supreme Court pick, Judge Neil Gorsuch, said he was disappointed in the president?s remarks on the judiciary in a closed-door meeting with Sen.

He also named the city in reference to a terror attack during an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on January 30 and in a press briefing later that day.\nMr Spicer told ABC News in an email that he “clearly meant Orlando.”\nMr Spicer isn’t the only Trump administration official to refer to a terror attack that never happened.
