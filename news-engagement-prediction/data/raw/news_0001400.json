Armed police storm street in 'dramatic car chase' for suspect with gun \nAlthough five men were arrested, there were no prosecutions at the time after the victim told police she could not say which of a number of men she had had sex with was the father. \nBut Judge Sarah Wright told the court that DNA analysis on defendant Amjad Ali has shown \"that it was 60 million times more likely that you were responsible for her pregnancy rather than an unknown male\". \nJudge Wright said Ali was not one of the five men named by the girl in 2001. \nShe told him: \"I have no hesitation in finding that you had sexual intercourse with her when she was heavily under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs such that she was unable to remember you.\" \nThe victim, in an impact statement read to the court, said: \"There's evil and truly evil people in the world. I feel my child was the product of pure evil.\" \nThe woman, who listened as prosecutor Sophie Drake read out her words, said: \"I was drawn into a world of fear, rape and horrific abuse. \n\"I lost my childhood at the hands of those men.\" Thug with 'not guilty' tattoo jailed for attacking woman over Â£20 debt \nShe described how she was shunned by many in her community who called her worse things than \"dirty, cheap slag\". \nShe said: \"No-one understood. No-one wanted to understand. I felt lost, isolated, trapped, ashamed and completely worthless. I was completely owned by these dirty old men who would do with me whatever then wanted, whenever they wanted.\" \nJudge Wright paid tribute to the woman, saying: \"As a result of what happened to her, her childhood and adolescence was taken from her. \n\"She remarkably transformed her life from thereon, putting her own child first. Hers is a tale of the most astonishing dedication and bravery.\" \nThe court heard how the girl was plied with alcohol and drugs from the age of 11 when she began being sexually exploited by a number of men. \nThe sentencing marks the end of a series of three major trials after Professor Alexis Jay's shocking report on child sexual exploitation (CSE) in Rotherham described how more than 1,400 children had been groomed, trafficked and raped in the town over a 16-year period. Twelve swans shot on the banks of the Thames in Windsor \nThe three trials - based around two unrelated families and their associates - have resulted in 18 people being jailed for sentences totalling more than 280 years and are the last following South Yorkshire Police investigations. \nThe National Crime Agency (NCA) has taken over all historic Rotherham CSE investigations with a team of more than 100 working on more than a dozen inquiries. \nLast year, the NCA said it had engaged with 133 victims and survivors but investigators were confident that Prof Jay was right when she said the total was around 1,400. \nBasharat Dad, 32, was found guilty of six counts of rape, five of indecent assault and one of false imprisonment and jailed for 20 years. \nNasar Dad, 36, was found guilty of one count of rape, inciting indecency with a child and false imprisonment and jailed for 14 years and six months. \nTayab Dad, 34, was found guilty of rape and jailed for 10 years. \nMatloob Hussain, 42, was found guilty of sexual intercourse with a girl under 13 and jailed for 13 years. \nMohammed Sadiq, 40, was also found guilty of sexual intercourse with a girl under 13 and jailed for 13 years. \nAmjad Ali, 38, pleaded guilty last year to sexual intercourse with a girl under 13 and was jailed for 11 years.
