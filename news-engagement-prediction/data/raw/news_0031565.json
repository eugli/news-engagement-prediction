On Monday, 13 February 2017, dam levels dropped a further 1,2%, compared to last week. And with the last 10% of a dam’s water not being useable, dam levels are effectively at 26,2%. \nNew video footage shot of four prominent Western Cape dams, the Steenbras Dam, Theewaterskloof dam, Voelvlei dam and Berg River dam, show a horrid bird's eye view of what this 26,2% dam levels actually look like.
