MPs votes overwhelmingly to trigger Article 50 Let Brexit begin! MPs votes overwhelmingly to trigger Article 50 BRITAIN took a giant leap towards freedom from the EU last night. PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 00:01, Thu, Feb 2, 2017 \nMPs voted overwhelmingly to give Theresa May the power to trigger Article 50 – the Brussels exit clause. \nIn a historic night at Westminster, the Government’s EU (Withdrawal) Bill cleared its first Parliamentary hurdle with the backing of 498 MPs. \nIn total, 114 MPs opposed the measure in their battle to block Britain’s departure from the EU. Related articles The full list of 114 MPs who voted AGAINST Article 50 and Brexit bill \nBut their opposition was crushed by the huge 384-vote margin. Anti-Brussels campaigners celebrated the dramatic moment. \nFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage declared: “We have done it.” And former Tory Cabinet minister Owen Paterson added: “This is irrevocable – we have voted to take back control. \n\"We are going to celebrate that the House of Commons has voted to take back control. PA/GETTY MPs have voted overwhelmingly to trigger Article 50 and leave the EU \n“We have delivered what 17.4 million people wanted.” We have delivered what 17.4 million people wanted Owen Paterson \nHowever Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was plunged into a fresh crisis when 47 of the party’s MPs defied his three-line whip and voted against the triggering of Article 50. \nJust one Tory – veteran Europhile Kenneth Clarke – broke ranks to vote with the opponents of Brexit. \nThe crunch vote last night was held to give the Prime Minister full powers to press ahead with Brexit after the Supreme Court ruled Parliament had to be consulted first. \nIn a humiliating rebuff to Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, MPs also roundly rejected an amendment tabled by the Scottish National Party seeking to block the progress of the Article 50 Bill. \nA total of 336 MPs voted against the SNP amendment while 100 supported it, including 33 Labour rebels and Mr Clarke. \nA further vote to rubber stamp the Parliamentary timetable was also passed by the Commons by 329 votes to 112. \nMPs will have a further chance to debate the Bill before it passes to the House of Lords later this month. PA Ed Miliband backed the bill despite having previously wanted to remain in the EU \nHowever, Mrs May’s schedule for triggering Brexit before the end of March remains firmly on track. EU Exit Secretary David Davis will today set out details of the Government’s negotiating position in a “White Paper” policy document. \nThe various votes followed two days of high drama in the Commons. Ex-Chancellor George Osborne took a swipe at the Government, accusing ministers of failing to prioritise the economy in Brexit negotiations. \nHe warned the talks over departure will be “bitter”. However, he pledged to back the Bill despite his support for EU membership. \nHe said: “To vote against the majority verdict of the largest democratic exercise in British history would risk putting Parliament against people, provoking a deep constitutional crisis and alienating people who already feel alienated.” \nHowever, he said he was “saddened” by the referendum result. “It saddens me Britain and Brexit are bracketed in the same group as other isolationist and nativist movements across the world,” he said. \n“We should strive to be, as the Prime Minister says, a more global Britain. But I lost the case and sacrificed my position for it.” \nSenior Tory backbencher Sir Gerald Howarth said Margaret Thatcher would have voted for triggering Article 50 if she had been an MP. \n“I hope those countries who in large part owe their liberation from the Soviet yoke to the government of Margaret Thatcher will respect our decision and help us forge a new, constructive relationship,” he said. GETTY Nigel Farage was in high spirits after the vote was announced \n“I hope the same will apply to those who we helped rebuild after the Second World War.” \nTory MP Chris Green said: “The British people had 40 years to make up their mind. It wasn’t about the last few weeks of a referendum campaign, it was about the lived experience in the European Union. \n“That’s why the people rejected it, not because of a few debatable arguments from one side or another.” \nFormer Labour leader Ed Miliband told MPs he would back the Bill to trigger Article 50, despite his past support for EU membership. GETTY Theresa May now has the power to trigger Article 50 \n“I feel the referendum stemmed in part from the sense of disaffection and deep frustration about politics that exists in the country,” he said. \n“We do not want to give the people who voted for Brexit a sense that they are being ignored once again.” \nTory MP Caroline Johnson, victor in the recent Sleaford and North Hykeham by-election, also used her maiden Commons speech to urge MPs to back the view of the majority. \nHowever, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron angered Tory MPs by calling for a fresh referendum.
