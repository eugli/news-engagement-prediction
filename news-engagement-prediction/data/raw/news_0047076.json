Image caption Inrix estimates that the direct and indirect costs of congestion for all UK drivers totalled £30.8bn in 2016, an average of £968 per driver \nAlso making the top 10 congestion list was the A24 from the Ormeau Road to Ann Street in the city centre. \nIt came in ninth in the congestion table. While it was busiest in the morning, the Lisburn Road was busiest in the afternoon. \nThe study, published on Monday, analysed 87 cities and large urban areas across the UK, as part of a wider survey of 1,064 cities in 38 countries worldwide. \nThe UK ranked as the fourth most congested developed country in the world and the third most congested in Europe, with drivers spending an average of 32 hours a year in congestion during peak hours. \nInrix estimates that the direct and indirect costs of congestion for all UK drivers totalled £30.8bn in 2016, an average of £968 per driver. \nAnn McGregor, chief executive of NI Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said infrastructure was one of the biggest issues consistently raised by its members. \n\"Businesses rely on having infrastructure and transport routes in place whereby goods and products can be moved efficiently and without extra costs from one location to another,\" she said. \n\"Therefore it is vital that key projects across the country, for example the York Street Interchange, A5, A6 and the Belfast Transport Hub, all proceed which will ease traffic congestion and in the process help businesses with their operational costs, supply chain efficiency and overall productivity.\" Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:41:10.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
