It is up to us to reach our full potential. We still have a lot of players who have not reached their prime. \n\"We are not ‘chasing’ a trophy: our focus is to build a team capable of challenging on every front, and we are still in three big competitions. \n“Once you do win that first trophy, maybe the pressure is relieved and, hopefully, many more will come, but it is a different scenario to what teams in England have done in the past. We are building something as a club. \n“We have not gone out and bought lots of players at once. It is a process here and everyone is buying into it. There are no stars here, which is what we are about, and the atmosphere is unlike anything I’ve been involved with. \n“Look at Hugo Lloris. He is captain of France and, I believe, the best goalkeeper in the Premier League but you will not meet someone as humble. The manager would not accept anything less.” \nDier also had a warning for any teams who believe they can follow Sunderland’s lead. Spurs were not at their best in the 0-0 draw at the Stadium of Light, while some players were unhappy the home side’s abrasive style went unchecked by referee Lee Mason. Spurs are stable but Pochettino still lacks options \nHarry Kane suggested Spurs could have had more protection from the official, particularly when Jack Rodwell was shown only a yellow card for a knee-high tackle on Mousa Dembele. \nYet, Dier has no doubts about Spurs’ ability to mix it. “Physically, we are one of the best teams in the Premier League,” he said. \n“I don’t think there is any team stronger than us. The physical aspect is becoming more and more important in modern sport, not just football, even though there is still room for technique and skill. \n\"People are paying more attention to every detail, such as sports science, to ensure they get more out of themselves.” \nTo have a chance of reaching the goals they have set themselves, Spurs are likely to need every last drop.
