The client is allowed to talk to her during this time, if they want to. \nViktoria says she’s a great listener, and some men even chat about their problems.

Today I woke up, and I want to live.\" \nShe admits her main market is single men, but adds that she wants to help everybody, so if women start asking for her services too, she is willing to warm their beds as well.
