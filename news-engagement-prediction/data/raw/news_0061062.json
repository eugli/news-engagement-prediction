People have always made marks, and marks for their own sake are what doodling is at its heart . But doodling now has a brand name - 'Zentangle (R)'. This has generated quite a bit of discussion on the internet, so let's look at some of the most talked-about issues. What is the difference between a 'doodle' and a 'Zentangle'? \nThe classic definition of a doodle - certainly the kind that people like to interpret - is a drawing done without full attention, while the person is otherwise occupied. People express their creativity in many ways. Often the detached and relaxed frame of mind that accompanies doodling is will be sustained for long periods, with doodles becoming involved artworks. Free use of mark-making, with simple, repetitive pattern is common. Artists will shift attention and become focused on their work, creating intricate patterns. \nZentangle 'inventors' emphasize this focused attention, and make it a point of difference. Unlike spontaneous doodling, Zentangle doodles are carried out within fixed formats and according to a prescribed method. The formulaic use of composition, method and pattern library results in a quite consistent look. Art teacher Phyl makes a useful comparison between authentic Italian food and a chain restaurant brand on her blog There's a Dragon in my Art Room . Meanwhile, Elizabeth Chan, reviewing a Zentangle program, takes a less prosaic view, commenting positively on the relaxation and focus that is part of the technique. She writes: \"I learned later on that Zentangle and doodling were not the same as I attended the Zentangle Program on the weekends....The difference though is that doodling is done out of boredom (most notably on the margins in one’s class notes) and mindlessness (most times, the doodles are not what one plans to do) while Zentangle is focused on creating pattern designs and mindfulness (you are purposely drawing something) so that you do not think of anything else.\" \nIt could be considered that the deliberate and formulaic approach used by Zentangle is superior, but while the end results appear more finished - often with a polished ' op art' look - they tend to lack the immediacy and signatory qualities of true doodling. An authentic doodle has some qualities in common with Surrealist 'automatic' writing and drawing, which sought to release rational control and liberate the subconscious. 'Mindlessness' is, in effect, the whole point. Why are 'Zentangles' Trademarked? \nZentangle's blend of doodling and New-Age Zen has an important third ingredient - contemporary business wizardry, beginning with a trademarked name. It's difficult to make a living in the arts, so to some extent, it's understandable that they wanted to create a defendable territory around their ideas. At this point, only the brand name and a few slogans are trademarked. The wording on their legal page consists of a list of instructions for using their trademarked terms, their 'language' and promoting the brand. \nOnce concern about the use of a trademark is that people who've been doodling all along find that rather simply expressing themselves artistically, they are now participating in a trendy branding exercise. One blogger writes : \"For a while now, like a few years, I had this habit of doodling and filling strings of lines with patterns and just “go with the flow”. A few months back I realized that what I was doing was actually a form of art! It is called Zentangle.\" Actually, this type of abstract designing is, well, just abstract art or doodling, respectable art genres in their own right. You'll also find plenty of examples of this type of pattern creation in textile arts and architecture. Do I Need Instructor Certification? \nThat you can be a 'certified' Zentangle instructor has led to some interesting discussion. The short answer is 'No', but if you want to work within the 'Zentangle' community, you need to play along. Talk a look at this Ask.com discussion - Do you really need a certified instructor Is Zentangle Art Therapy? \nThere is no question that drawing of any kind, and particularly doodling, can be a meditative activity that can be very therapeutic. This is highlighted by Zentangle in their literature. However it's important to understand that Zentangle certification is not a certificate in art therapy. Certification as an art therapist usually requires a psychology or counseling degree and experience, experience in the arts, and a masters degree in art therapy. So it's particularly concerning to find Zentangle (TM) classes being advertised as 'Zentangle - Art Therapy' . \nOf particular interest is the comparison between the 'apparent simplicity' Zentangle and Yoga. Becoming proficient in Yoga takes years of practice, and certification, again depending on location and governing body, can take hundreds of hours of supervised practice. \nWhile formally qualified therapists may indeed employ the Zentangle method within their practice, a three-day workshop to become a 'Certified Zentangle Teacher (tm)' or 'CZT' does not make a person a qualified therapist of any sort. Perhaps in some countries calling oneself a therapist, or calling a technique a therapy, doesn't involve any legal requirements, but I do question the ethics involved here. So Why Do People Do Zentangle? \nDespite some questions around the Zentangle concept, the convenient 'pre-packaged' ideas and materials suit some people well. They help to reduce anxiety around making art, from choosing materials to getting started with simple templates and a ready-made library of patterns to copy. For some people this can be a marvelous stepping-stone to creativity, especially given how daunting so much of our traditional art teaching methods can be. It is quite similar to craft activities like photo scrapbooking, with 'Creative Memories (tm)' doing the groundwork of design, or quilting with a readymade kit. What this process risks losing, however, is the artist's own, intuitive sense of design and expressive mark making. Zentangles have a certain homogeneity for a reason. There's no doubt that the Zentangle process, with education on mindfulness combined with relaxing mark-making, is calming and beneficial, and for those who enjoy organized systems and being part of a group, the 'Avon Lady model' provides a comfortable structure. Do I Need Zentangle Products to Doodle? \nNo. You can doodle - or even do 'Zentangles' - on any paper and with any pen. For best results, choose a heavy, bleedproof paper and fiber-tip pen, such as Sakura Micron or Artline Fine Liner. One benefit of choosing Zentangle products though is that they are convenient, with pre-prepared 'tiles' of paper, and a selection of pens that are consistent with those used by demonstrators, so you will get predictable results. Why So Critical? \nMy criticism of Zentangle boils down to the ethical issues with branding and patenting. While they are not patent trolls (a patent troll is all about using the patent as a legal weapon to extort money), attempting to brand and patent doodling is highly questionable. Being the About.com Guide to Drawing, I regularly receive letters from people asking me to sell their latest product - a gadget to help with perspective drawing or a grid system for copying. But Zentangle doesn't have a product - it's trying to turn something people already do into a product. It's like taking the art of knitting, saying \"meditate with every stitch. Use this selection of patterns, and this selection of stitches, and one of these yarns.\" - and saying that this is a unique idea that belongs to them, and they'll take you to court should you happen to create something using that combination and without paying their license fee. It's nonsense. I wanted to write something more balanced, because I have friends who love this system, but in the end, it would equate to my promoting Apple and its acquisitive, unethical patent 'walled garden'. Apple has its fans, and so does Zentangle, but I am not one of them. Zentangle's patent application means that I will never purchase or support their products or activities in any way. Creativity belongs to all people. But Zentangle Helped My Creativity \nA lot of people love Zentangle. A common theme is 'I discovered my creativity' coupled with 'I don't care about that patent stuff'. One commenter on a critical blog said ' But I personally don't care who capitalizes on what '. Fair enough. It's awesome that you found Zentangle helpful. If you, as an individual, don't care about patents, that's fine. Just be aware that there are some 'cons' along with the 'pros' before you support them by spending your hard-earned on the materials, books and programs. When other artists using doodling as an abstract art form start finding themselves slapped with a lawsuit for patent infringement, that lack of care could be contributing to injustice. Bottom line: It's lovely that their method has helped people be creative, but it could soon be hindering the creativity of others. Not only is it morally questionable, but legally too: one cannot copyright ideas, methods or systems , and there is clearly not sufficient difference between Zentangles and any other doodling and abstract art to warrant a patent. Fortunately, the Patents board appears to agree - it's already been rejected EIGHT times.
