USA TODAY Sports Falcons G Andy Levitre will appear in his first Super Bowl on Sunday. (Photo: Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON — The youngest Atlanta Falcons fan at Sunday’s Super Bowl will be Lily Jean Levitre, the three-week-old daughter of Atlanta guard Andy Levitre. \nLily was born hours after the Falcons’ divisional round playoff win against the Seattle Seahawks, and she’ll be at NRG Stadium to watch her dad play against the New England Patriots in Super Bow LI. (Yes, Levitre dropped about $1,700 on a ticket for his newborn.) \n“The story that we can tell her when she's older, I think she'll really enjoy that,” he said. \nIt will be just one of several great ones from what has been a wild three weeks for the family. \nMORE COVERAGE Julio Jones' unselfish approach helps Falcons on field, earns teammates' respect \nLevitre and his wife, Katie, realized throughout the season that the due date for their first child would come right in the middle of the playoffs. In fact, Katie was three or four days overdue when her husband departed for the Georgia Dome on Jan. 14 to play in the first postseason game in his eight-year career. \nAbout an hour before the 4:35 p.m. ET kickoff, Katie's contractions started. After experiencing false labor in the weeks prior, she knew these were real. But they were still mild enough and far enough apart that Katie decided to watch the game at the stadium. She called a Falcons employee to tell him labor had begun but asked that Levitre not be informed unless things escalated quickly. Luckily they did not, and the couple was able to safely make it to the hospital after the Falcons won. Lily Jean was born around midnight. \nThey Levitres were able to spend two weeks at home as a family of three — with little sleep and lots of diapers — before Andy headed to Houston with the Falcons last weekend. He’s a key part of the only offensive line in the NFL to start the same five players all season. \nBut he's more proud to be a parent. \n*** \nFollow Lindsay H.

Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Week 2: The Falcons outlasted the Oakland Raiders in a wild one thanks to Taylor Gabriel's 8-yard touchdown catch on a tipped pass. Atlanta's defense held on a fourth-and-2 run to help wrap up the first win of the year. Cary Edmondson, USA TODAY Sports Week 3: The depth of the Falcons' offense began to show in a 45-23 win over the New Orleans Saints. Running back Tevin Coleman scored three touchdowns, while Devonta Freeman had 207 yards from scrimmage. Derick E. Hingle, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 4: Julio Jones and Matt Ryan both exploded for record days in Atlanta's 48-33 win over the defending NFC-champion Carolina Panthers.

Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 5: Atlanta handed the defending Super Bowl-champion Denver Broncos their first loss despite a less explosive output from its offense.

Ron Chenoy, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 6: Dan Quinn's return to Seattle ended in disappointment as the Falcons fell 26-24 to the Seahawks amid controversy.

Joe Nicholson, USA TODAY Sports Week 7: A wild comeback left the Falcons stunned in a 33-30 overtime loss to the San Diego Chargers.

Ryan Mathews ran for two touchdowns and the Falcons had to settle for three field goals. Eric Hartline, USA TODAY Sports Week 12: Taylor Gabriel emerged as the Falcons' newest weapon in a 38-19 win over the Arizona Cardinals. The diminutive receiver and free agent pickup took two short passes for touchdowns and had four receptions for 75 yards. Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 13: Eric Berry proved to be a worthy foe for the Falcons, as the Kansas City Chiefs escaped with a 29-28 win. Berry returned one interception and became the first player to return a two-point conversion for a score to seal Kansas City's win. Jason Getz, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen Week 14: Atlanta's defense got in on the scoring in a 42-14 rout of the Los Angeles Rams. Deion Jones returned an interception for a touchdown, and Vic Beasley forced a Jared Goff fumble that he scooped up for a score.
