Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images \nThe next time your kid asks you to buy a bottle of glue, you may have a hard time finding one. \nAn old craze has returned among tweens across the country: Slime. \nCreated using a combination of glue, water, sodium tetraborate and food coloring, slime isn't a new craft for kids, but it's gaining steam. Thanks to social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, new recipes and images of brightly-colored and glittery slime have flooded the internet. A post shared by alyssa j. (@craftyslimecreator) on Feb 16, 2017 at 2:30pm PST \nThe trend boosted sales of Elmer's glue in the second half of 2016 and more than doubled sales in December, according Newell Brands . A spokeswoman for Elmer's said that the company is increasing production of its glue products to meet the demand, and is exploring its own slime recipes to \"make slime even more fun and worry-free.\" \nGiven the trend's momentum, it wouldn't be all that surprising if the company developed its own slime kits or branded content in the future. \nDemand for glue has risen so much that many stores are sold out of the product altogether.
