Laura Murray \nMonday-Thursday you can start your morning with chia pudding or an egg white omelet on dry toast or whatever it is that makes you feel better about being alive in this world. But on Friday, let’s break out the apple pie toast. \nThis is not my original idea, if it was, I’d be a millionaire by now and could buy wine on flights instead of drinking my seat partner’s while they sleep. It’s from the mind of pastry chef Daniel Alvarez at Daily Provisions , which just opened this week right next to the ~new~ Union Square Cafe, aka Danny Meyerland. So thanks, Daniel, for all the work you do (work includes: these super-sized English muffins they serve, a ton of crullers, and an everything croissant because you can have everything). Laura Murray The crullers at Daily Provisions (I call the maple one on top!). \nGet to the toast, lady. \nOkay! \nPer Alvarez, this is ridiculously easy. Peel and slice up 6 apples: 3 Granny Smiths , 3 Honeycrisps . Toss them with ½ cup sugar , 1 Tbsp. cornstarch , ½ tsp. ground cinnamon , and a generous pinch of kosher salt in a Pyrex. Into the oven they go (350°, what else?) until they look soft and jammy, like apple pie filling, 20–30 minutes. \nThen take a slice of really good bread (or oatmeal!), remember it’s Friday, and spread a thick layer of really good salted butter on it. Apple preserves go on top, where you’ll be floating for the rest of the day. \nThis recipe has not been tested by the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:04:17.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
