She's a talented author, a general physician and neurosurgeon, an opera singer, and also an international Taekwondo champion, apart from being an astronaut at the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA). She is only one of the two astronauts to have been selected from the 3,200 candidates who enrolled themselves in the Citizen Science Astronaut Program (CSA). She is all set to work with eight other NASA astronauts who will fly off for space missions in the year 2018. She also took training in Muay Thai from a Navy seal. Muay Thai is a professional combat sport that originated in Thailand. Speaking with Edmonton Sun , Pandya said, \"Since I was a kid, I loved space, I loved the stars. So this kind of is a realisation of a lifelong dream.\" Shawna graduated from the University of Alberta, doing her Bachelor of Science (BSc) in neuroscience. Later on, she did her masters in space sciences from the International Space University in France and MD in medicine from the University of Alberta. She enrolled herself in medical school and the space programme simultaneously, considering the latter a backup plan. She had training in speaking French, Russian and Spanish. She told Hindustan Times , \"If you prioritise your passions and commitments, it’s wonderful how much you can achieve.\" With her roots in Mumbai, she visited the city to see her family and she has been giving motivational talks at the local hospitals, speaking with doctors and practising students. In an interview with Hindustan Times , she said, \"On Tuesday, I met students from Lilavatibai Podar High School. The questions they asked me were brilliant, right from zero-gravity experiences to outer space. When I talk to students, medical undergraduates, I realise they have the zeal to venture out but aren’t always aware of the ways in which they can. All we need is to get acquainted with everyday developments in science, be resilient, and always try to achieve something bigger.\" Do you have an interesting story to share? Please write to us at .
