Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nGameiro netted from the spot just before the hour mark but was withdrawn, much to his fury, in the 71st minute. \nHis actions have fuelled speculation he could be set to leave the Spanish capital in the summer, with Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur both believed to be keen to land him. Gameiro was angry with Simeone (Picture: Bongarts/Getty) \nBut despite revealing he was ‘angry’ at being subbed off, Gameiro insisted the decision was Simeone’s to make. \n‘Yes, I was angry because you want to play the whole match when you’re playing well,’ he told Marca.
