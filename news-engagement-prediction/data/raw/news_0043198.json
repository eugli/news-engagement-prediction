But this may be it. You can do this without having to worry about Slate running a \"Why Shower Oranges Are Bad,\" thinkpiece or have it turn out that the concept of Shower Oranges originated from a neo-Nazi forum. \nYou can also completely ignore this and never have the thought cross your mind ever again. \nAlthough it does seem oddly tempting to try. \nAt least once.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:15:23.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
