This sensor is fairly small though, at 21.60 x 17.30mm, it’s smaller than APS-C sensors. If you’re not sure what difference a sensor size makes, then read our guide Here's How Digital SLR Sensor Crop Affects Your Lenses Here's How Digital SLR Sensor Crop Affects Your Lenses Most of us own cameras with small cropped sensors, which artificially increase focal lengths on full frame lenses. Here's what you need to know. Read More . \n4K video capture is included, but it’s important to note that this is “Ultra High Definition”, with a resolution of 3840 X 2160. True or “cinema” 4K has a resolution of 4096 x 2160. It’s a minor issue, and it’s not something that will impact most people, but it’s something to be aware of. \nThe articulated 3-inch touchscreen is excellent. It’s clear, and responds well to touch. Many cameras include a rotating screen of some sort, however many higher end models sadly lack it. This works very well on the Panasonic, and is great for vlogging ( what’s life like as a vlogger Life as a Vlogger: What's It Like? We Asked 10 YouTubers Life as a Vlogger: What's It Like?

Here's why. Read More . It provides many options for changing settings. While some of the menus can be complex to navigate, it does a good job at getting out of the way to let you view your image. \nHaving so many external controls is a great feature. The top left dial selects shooting mode, and allows you to choose stills, burst, or timed shot. The dial on the top right allows you to choose between several different automatic and manual modes, along with video. These dials combined with the many function keys all over the body allow you to adjust most settings without using the touchscreen. \nThe OLED viewfinder is another function not often included on mirrorless cameras. Many cameras that do include one, occasionally use a rangefinder (such as the Fujifilm X-Pro 2 ). This viewfinder is excellent. As it’s an OLED screen, it mirrors what is shown on the main display. A small sensor on the cup switches the image between the viewfinder and the touchscreen when your eye approaches. Alternatively, you can use a small button appropriately placed to the left. \nFinally, the pop up flash is very nice to have. While these can sometimes spoil pictures, it’s nice that once is included rather than left off. This does create a DSLR-esque bulge on the top — it’s not as compact as the flash found on the Sony A6300 Mirrorless to Impress: Sony A6300 16-50mm Kit Review & Giveaway Mirrorless to Impress: Sony A6300 16-50mm Kit Review & Giveaway Following on from the massively popular A6000, comes the A6300, a small interchangeable mirrorless camera with an APS-C sensor, 4K video capabilities, and more features than most enthusiasts will ever need.

I’m delighted to tell you that the HDMI out is full resolution 1080p, and carries audio as well! Canon has a lot to learn from Panasonic. You also get a shutter release and a USB port – both fairly common features. Autofocus \nThe autofocus on the G80 is nothing to write home about. It performed reasonably well when taking focus (although it did occasionally mis a shot). It struggled terribly during video and live view, and took what seemed like an eternity to refocus when the subject changed. \nThere is an extra focus feature available however. The G80 allows you to re-focus images in camera after they have been taken. This works well, and is extremely useful if your focus is off (and it will be off if you use the autofocus at all). Image Stabilisation \nThe image stabilisation in the G80 is wonderful. Most camera manufacturers rely on Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS). This is built into lenses, and electronically moves the lens to counter shakes from your hand or other movement. This traditionally works fairly well, but it does require a lens that supports it. The included kit lens comes with OIS, but there is another trick the G80 performs here. It includes Electronic Image Stabilisation (EIS). This works much like OIS. The camera moves the sensor up, down, left, or right to counter any movement. OIS combined with EIS works very well to reduce shake and blur, and EIS means that even lenses without OIS can benefit. The Lens \nKit lenses provided with cameras are usually not the best quality. They tend to be cheaply made, and often struggle in low light. The Panasonic 12 – 60mm is slightly different. The focal length provides a good balance between wide angle and zoom. It is well made, and the focus ring is thick and feels tough. A variable aperture of f/3.5 – 5.6 means that images will darken as you zoom, often requiring an exposure adjustment. If you want to use manual focus, be aware that this lens is “focus by wire”. Rather than a mechanical focus ring, it is electronic. Turning the focus ring will send a digital signal to the camera to adjust the focus. This works well, but it takes some getting used to if you have used a mechanical manual focus before. Image Quality \nLet’s look at some sample still images. Unfortunately, it’s slightly disappointing. Images are occasionally washed out, and auto focus misses more than it should. While images are sharp, sometimes they look like a smartphone could have done better! As with many cameras, the images can be improved with a little post processing. A premium lens will make the biggest difference to quality. All of these images are straight out the camera. Video Quality \nWhere this camera really comes alive is shooting video. Many helpful features are included, such as focus peaking (something that many other cameras do not have). \nThere were no skipped frames or signs of overheating when shooting 4K, although I did experience a minor bug: the G80 refused to stop recording. It no longer responded to any buttons, or the power switch. Removing the battery and restarting bought the camera back, but it was unusual. The clip being recorded at the time was lost. \nHere’s the sample 4K footage: \nAnd here’s a frame extracted from some of the other 4k footage we took — it’s sharper than the photos! \nThe G80 is undoubtedly a video powerhouse. While it is not quite at the same level as the GH4 (and nowhere near the GH5), it can still hold its own, producing excellent video quality. It does lack some professional features of it’s bigger brothers (4:2:2 color over HDMI, not true Cinema 4K), but unless you produce video for a living, you’re unlikely to miss these features. \nThe Sony A6500 does give it some stiff competition, but overheating problems will lead you to Panasonic. \nEnter our giveaway below to win a Panasonic G80 with 12-60mm kit lens! \nPanasonic G80/G85 Giveaway Our verdict of the Panasonic Lumix DMC-G80/G85 :If you’re looking to get into enthusiast 4K video production, the G80/G85 is an affordable powerhouse. Average image quality means you may wish to avoid this camera for stills, however. 8 10", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:46:33.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
