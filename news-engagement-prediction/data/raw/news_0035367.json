However, there had been significant damage to the glass display cases in an attempt to access the jewellery. \nIt was not yet known what amount of jewellery had been taken. \nHansen said the store would be closed on Friday while staff cleaned up the damage and assisted with police investigations. \n\nPolice would like to hear from anyone who was in the Nelson Central area around the time of the burglary, as they may have information that could assist with their investigation. \nAny information can be provided to Nelson Police on (03) 546 3840. Alternatively, information can also be reported anonymously via Crimestoppers on 08000 555 111.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:28:32.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
