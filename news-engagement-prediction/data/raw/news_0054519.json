TIRUPATI: Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao visited the temple town of Tirumala for the darshan of the presiding deity, Lord Sri Venkateswara, and offered jewellery worth Rs 5 crore to the deity, on Wednesday. KCR's visit is in fulfilment of the vow he had taken during the struggle for separate Telangana that he would offer gold ornaments to Lord Venkateswara if the new state was formed. He had planned to visit the temple town several times in the past. But the visit finally materialised on Tuesday. He was accompanied by his family and a few cabinet colleagues. KCR was accorded a warm welcome when he landed at the Tirupati airport. The police heightened security in the ghat roads leading to the temple. Earlier, TTD executive officer D Sambasiva Rao and joint executive officer KS Sreenivasa Raju welcomed the chief minister. The TTD arranged for his stay at Sri Krishna guesthouse. He offered prayers to the Lord on Wednesday, along with his family. He donated 'Saligrama Haram' and 'Petala Kanthabharanam' to Sri Venkateswara on behalf of the Telangana government. He also offered prayers in the temple of Goddess Padmavathi at Tiruchanoor and presented a nose ring to the Goddess. The chief minister was accompanied by his six sisters and their family members. KCR's son and IT minister KT Rama Rao, his daughter and MP Kavita, his nephew and minister T Harish Rao, and Assembly speaker Madhusudana Chari also reached Tirumala. Telangana chief secretary SP Singh, former chief secretary Rajiv Sharma, and Telangana tourism advisor KV Ramanachari were also part of the team.
