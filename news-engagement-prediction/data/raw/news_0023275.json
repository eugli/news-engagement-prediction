Now, scientists can delve into the quinoa genome as well. \n“Quinoa has great potential to enhance global food security,” Tester said. \nThe grain thrives at any altitude up to 4,000 metres (13,000 feet) above sea level, in conditions that would leave most food plants struggling. Some strains grow well at temperatures up to 38 degrees. \nBest known outside its native region as a health food, quinoa is gluten-free and contains essential amino acids, fibre, vitamins and minerals. Quinoa isn't a threat to food security. It's improving Peruvian farmers' lives Read more \nIt also scores lower than other crops on the glycaemic index, a measure of how quickly foods raise blood sugar levels – a major concern for those with diabetes. \nYet global consumption remains incidental compared with wheat, rice, barley or corn – less than 100,000 tonnes a year compared with hundreds of millions of tonnes for each of the other major grains and cereals. \nOne problem with quinoa is that the plant naturally produces bitter-tasting seeds, Tester explained. The bitterness – a natural defence against birds and other pests – comes from chemical compounds called saponins. The process for removing these chemicals is labour-intensive and costly, and requires ample use of water. \nAnother constraint is that quinoa plants tends to have small seed heads and long stalks that can collapse in strong wind or heavy rain. \n“Despite its agronomic potential, quinoa is still an underutilised crop, with relatively few active breeding programmes,” Tester and three dozen colleagues wrote in the journal Nature. \nFirst grown by humans thousands of years ago in the high plateau around Lake Titicaca in the Andes, quinoa is still barely domesticated, the researchers said. \nTester’s team has already pinpointed genes, including one that controls the production of saponins, that could be altered – through breeding or gene editing – to enhance quality and yields. \n“With this new knowledge of quinoa DNA, we can quickly and easily select plants that do not produce bitter substances in the breeding process,” said co-author Robert van Loo, a scientist at Wageningen University and Research Centre in the Netherlands. South American varieties could probably be made sweeter with a single gene change, he added. \nMost quinoa is grown in three Andean countries: Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. \nThe United States and Canada account for nearly 70% of exports, followed by France, the Netherlands and Germany. The price of quinoa has nearly tripled in recent years due to increased demand. \nIf printed, the sequence of letters corresponding to the quinoa genome – comprised of 1.3bn molecular building blocks – would take up 500,000 pages.
