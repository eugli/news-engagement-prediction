Well, Reddit user HEV_tux has. \nIn fact, this fine individual apparently just watched seasons one through six of “Game of Thrones” for the third time! \nThat sounds like a lot, but when you read what HEV_tux picked up on this last run through Westeros , your mind will be blown. Reddit \nYou definitely missed these details on first viewing, so, without further ado, check out the sneaky “Game of Thrones” spoilers that foreshadowed eight major events leading up to season seven. Jaime Lannister and Jory Cassel reminisce about the Siege of Pyke and the fight against the Greyjoys. \nIn the above scene, as Jaime and Jory are speaking, you can hear Jory say “a Greyjoy nearly took my eye out” at 1:01. This is clearly foreshadowing Jamie Lannister eventually stabbing Jory in the eye. After Cersei and Jaime discover Bran survived the fall at Winterfell, Jamie says “I think I would rather be dead than crippled.” \nIn season three of “Game of Thrones,” Jamie actually becomes a cripple when his hand is chopped off by Roose Bolton. The irony. In season three of “GoT,” Tywin Lannister has an interesting conversation with Joffrey Baratheon in King’s Landing. \nAs you can see at 1:25 in the clip above, Tywin walks towards Joffrey, who is sitting on the Iron Throne, and says, “We could arrange to have you carried.” \nIf you pay close attention, you’ll see while Tywin is walking towards Joffrey, the flame closest to Joffrey is waning, while the one closest to Tywin is roaring. \nIf only we knew Joffrey was about to die, and Tywin was about to ascend to new heights… Giphy In the very first episode of “Game of Thrones,” Ned Stark, Robb Stark and the others find a dire wolf killed by a stag. \nIn the penultimate episode of the first season of “GoT,” another wolf is killed by a stag when Ned Stark’s execution is ordered by King Joffrey Baratheon. HBO While he does kill Jory Cassel in season one of “Game of Thrones,” Jaime Lannister is interrupted by a Lannister soldier stabbing Ned Stark before he can actually attempt to kill Ned in the same fight. HBO \nHowever, as we see in season six of “Game of Thrones,” during the flashback Tower of Joy scene, a young Ned Stark has no problem finishing the job on Ser Arthur Dayne, Jamie Lannister’s teacher, after their one-on-one fight was interrupted. See? It all comes full circle. In the season finale of season two, Theon Greyjoy, surrounded by an army of 500 Northmen, promised to take revenge and kill the hornblower who won’t stop berating him. \nAs it turns out, that hornblower was Ramsay Bolton, and we all know how things played out for Reek/Theon until the Battle of the Bastards, don’t we? In season four of “Game of Thrones,” Littlefinger tells Robin Arryn, “People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots.” \nThree key deaths that occur in season four are Joffrey’s, poisoned at his own wedding dinner, Shae’s, choked to death in bed by Tyrion, and Tywin’s, shot by Tyrion with a crossbow while sitting on the toilet. According to HEV_tux, in the books, Theon has an internal monolog and says, “Hodor did not know much, but no one could doubt that he knew his name.” HBO \nI think it’s safe to assume we all know where this one is going… \nSo, when’s that “Game of Thrones” season seven start date? \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.
