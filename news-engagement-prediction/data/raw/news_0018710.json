She said: 'The dress was one of the most special things about the day, it made it complete and I was overjoyed to have been able to wear such a beautiful family heirloom. 'I didn't even know of its existence until my grandmother brought it up when I told her in August 2015 that Alfred and I had got engaged. Tess looked stunning in the antique lace dress at her June wedding in a tiny Scottish village church to Alfred Newall, 30, a furniture maker from Notting Hill, West London 'She said that her mother's wedding dress was up in her attic in a box and she thought that I might like it as I love antique things. 'I went up to the attic and found it in the box all wrapped up in tissue paper and when I held it up I couldn't believe it, it was just so beautiful and it didn't need all that much alteration. 'I had the top altered a little. I found some new ribs and antique lace in a shop on the Portobello Road and the alterations were exactly as I wanted them. 'After the wedding the dress had to be cleaned and we were very concerned about who might be the best people to do it. 'My dad was aware of the reputation of Kleen Cleaners and the fact they had a Royal warrant. They seemed a safe choice to take the dress to. Tess's Facebook post has been shared hundreds of times since it was posted on Friday morning, with people all over the world promising to help spread the word 'But when we went back to pick it up we found that the shop was closed and there was a notice saying administrators had been called in to sequester the company. 'There was no sign of the dress, nothing to match the ticket we had and we're worried that it has been sold off. I don't want any kind of witch hunt against the company, the only thing that matters to me is getting my dress back. 'I put an appeal on Facebook and I was amazed at how quickly it was being shared and how many people were prepared t help me. 'It's so unique that I'm hoping someone will see the pictures and if they see it for sale anywhere will get in touch. 'I hate the thought that something whach has spent so many generations in my family has gone missing after I wore it, it's been awful and very distressing.' The dress was kept in the loft of Joanna Torin, 88, and didn't see the light of day for decades before Tess got it out. Her mother Sally Gammell has also been devastated by the loss of the dress and has joined her daughter's appeal. TESS'S POST IN FULL 'I have just found out that the dry cleaners have lost my much loved wedding dress. It was made by my Great Great Granny in 1870 (I altered the top) and I wore it in June 2016. 'Kleen Cleaners in Edinburgh used to be the best but recently fell into crooked hands and have gone into liquidation. It seems that the dress was taken to be sold so it could be winging its way anywhere. Please share this far and wide in case anyone stumbles across it! I realise there are far greater issues in the world but it means the world to us. More family memories need to be woven into its threads. 'Thank you so so much.'
