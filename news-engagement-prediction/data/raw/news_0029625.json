(PTI File Photo) \nAmid the ongoing political battle between O Panneerselvam and VK Sasikala, Tamil Nadu police on Monday night arrested a man for entering the house of DMK patriarch Karunanidhi and threatening his wife with a toy gun. \nPolice arrested the man, who has since been indentified as Prasad, after he entered the CIT colony residence of the DMK leader and threatened his wife Rajanithi, demanding jewels and money. \nThe attempted robbery came to light after Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi, who was attending Monday’s high level committee party meeting at the DMK HQ on Anna Salai, received a phone call from home and rushed back to the Alwarpet residence. \nPolice say that Prasad, in a desperate attempt to get money, had wandered into the house without knowing who the owner was. \nOfficials said it was a case of attempted robbery. \nThe 93-year-old veteran leader, who has not been seen in public since his return from hospital in December, is said to be recovering, according to MLA J Anbazhagan. The MLA tweeted that Kalaignar (artist), as Karunanidhi is respectfully known as, is recovering and that he will be able to meet the public in March. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:14.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
