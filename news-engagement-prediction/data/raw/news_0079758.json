(Twitter @Laura_Spurway) \nA man who heard his wife’s murder while on the phone to her has seen her killer be sentenced to at least 17 years in jail. \nPriyantha Hewage listened on the phone from Brisbane – where he was working – as his wife Prasad Somawansa, 48, was stabbed to death in her Melbourne home in February last year. \nSigaragh “Steve” Baea, 22, today pleaded guilty to the murder of Sri Lankan-born Ms Somawansa, who was the mother of one of his friends, SES volunteer Wishhasad. \nIn his sentencing submissions, Supreme Court Judge James Elliott labelled the murder \"brutal and unprovoked\". \n\"Ms Somawansa had only shown you hospitality and courtesy in the past. You took to her with a knife... and stabbed her at least 38 times,\" he said. \nEarlier this year, a court heard Baea had reconnected with Wishhasad during a visit to Australia and was “jealous” of his friend’s family. \nDefence barrister Ruth Shann said Baea came from a background of “disharmony and dysfunction” and felt envious. \nHe had arrived at Ms Somawansa’s Hoppers Crossing house unannounced earlier on the day of the murder and had returned after being dropped to Werribee Plaza, but became angry when he was told to leave, the court heard. \nDuring a phone call with his wife, Mr Somawansa heard her say \"you go out\" three times, before yelling \"Dos\" - the name she called her husband. She could be heard making deep breathing noises before the telephone call cut out. \nThe court also heard Baea had a violent father and was abandoned by his mother at age 14. \nThe Papua New Guinean national was today sentenced in the Victorian Supreme Court to 22 years of imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 17 years. \nWith AAP.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:01:48.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
