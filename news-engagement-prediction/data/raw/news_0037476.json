Following the incident, Keith said he called on the community to help Parks move to a different neighborhood. Soon after, the Ilitch family sent Keith a check to cover Parks' rent and continued doing so until Parks died more than a decade later. Keith keeps a copy of one check in his desk as a reminder of the Ilitches' generosity during Parks' time of need, he said.\nKeith also noted the Ilitch family 's long-term investment in the struggling Michigan city.\n\"If it hadn’t been for them, Detroit would not be in the renaissance that they are in now,\" Keith told CNN.\nOther philanthropy from the Ilitches included donating millions to Detroit's Wayne State University and investing in Little Caesars Arena, the future home of the Detroit Red Wings, according to CNN.\nIn 1959, Mike and Marian Ilitch opened the first Little Caesars in Garden City, Michigan.
