Even after the council was advised by an auditor that there was a \"prima facie case of fraud\" no further action was taken and the RSL membership was not informed of the concerns. \nEight past and present state councillors including Mr Rowe and Rod White - who went on to become national president – received shares of $2.5 million in consulting fees from the league's aged care arm, RSL LifeCare.
