This is the first Chick-fil-A in the country. When it opened in 1946, it was called the \"Dwarf Grill.\" Now it's one of 12 Chick-fil-A \"Dwarf Houses\" in the country that serve the chain's original menu. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson The restaurant offers full table service. This is the menu you get when you sit down. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson It features sides like macaroni and cheese, corn bread, collard greens, green beans, and sweet potato soufflé, none of which are available at Chick-fil-A restaurants nationwide. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson The sweet potato soufflé features a topping of candied pecans. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson The macaroni tasted home-made, but we wished it was a little hotter so all the cheese was completely melted. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson We also ordered the fried okra, which is a Southern favorite. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson The batter on the outside is light and crispy, and the okra inside is hot and juicy, with a hint of salt. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson The restaurant also offers this \"secret\" menu. It's a replica of one of Chick-fil-A's original menus. You can order anything from the menu, including the steak plate, which features a grilled tenderloin steak with shoestring potatoes. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson Other options include fried ham sandwiches, pimento sandwiches, and grilled cheese. We decided to order the cheeseburger. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson The burger was much larger than we were expecting. The patty was thick and flavorful and the cheese was melted perfectly between the patty and the bun. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson For dessert, the restaurant serves a variety of hand-made pies. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson Options include three fried pies: apple, sweet potato, and peach; and three ice box pies: lemon, chocolate, and coconut. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson Here's where the pies are made. Business Insider/Hayley Peterson The chain also serves freshly baked chocolate chip cookies for dessert.
