Posted 17 Feb 2017 17:18 Updated 17 Feb 2017 17:20 A \nSINGAPORE: In three years, a PAP Community Foundation (PCF) principal pocketed S$79,136.30 in school fees, and spent it all on herself and her family. \nKoh Anna, also known as Susie, pleaded guilty to one charge of criminal breach of trust for stealing S$50,409.45 from the PCF Centre at Block 515 Jurong West Street 52 in 2012. \nAnother two charges, involving S$1,419.50 and S$27,307.35 which she stole in 2010 and 2011 respectively, were taken into consideration during sentencing. \nKoh was jailed five months on Friday (Feb 17). \nA district court heard Koh, as principal, was entrusted with all the fees the school collected from parents. If fees collected exceeded S$500, Koh was to bank in the cash into the school’s bank account by the next day. She was also in charge of the centre’s petty cash, which amounted to S$500. \nKoh misappropriated the money by banking in only a part of what she received and pocketing the remainder. She did this for three years undetected, until an anonymous tip-off in October 2012 led to her discovery. \nBy then, Koh had misappropriated a total of S$79,136.30. No restitution has been made. \nFor criminal breach of trust, Koh could have been jailed up to 15 years and fined. \nLast year, another former PCF principal was found guilty of misappropriating school fees . \nBavani V R Kumaran, 39, pocketed more than S$13,500 over 21 months , when she was principal of the Ang Mo Kio branch of the PCF Sparkletots Preschool. - CNA/dl", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T16:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T11:46:35.141+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
