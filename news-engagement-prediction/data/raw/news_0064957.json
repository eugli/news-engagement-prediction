Popularity Helps By BEN ZAUZMER Continue reading the main story Photo The YouTube sensation “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” from “Trolls” is one of five Oscar nominees for best original song. Credit DreamWorks Animation/20th Century Fox Justin Timberlake ’s “Can’t Stop the Feeling!,” from the movie “Trolls,” has been celebrated by fans since it debuted last May, when it reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 en route to becoming the top-selling United States single of the year. Now, Mr. Timberlake hopes for one more honor: best original song at the Academy Awards. Will the song’s soaring popularity lead to an Oscar? Does it help Mr. Timberlake’s cause that his tune was featured in an animated, musical film? That is, when choosing best song, does the academy have a preference for fan favorites, or a bias against certain film genres? To answer these questions, let’s examine the numbers behind the musical numbers. The first question is about the significance of being popular. Intuitively, we know popularity probably counts for something: Ever since 1935, when the academy handed out the first statuette for best original song, it has frequently bestowed the honor on crowd-pleasers, whether it was “Over the Rainbow” (from “The Wizard of Oz”), “My Heart Will Go On” (“Titanic”) or “Skyfall” (from the film of the same name). Let’s use the number of views a song has on YouTube as a proxy for popularity. Using data for movies released since 1990 — a sufficiently large sample size to draw meaningful conclusions — the song nominee with the greatest YouTube popularity has taken home the trophy 46 percent of the time, from “Streets of Philadelphia” (for the 1993 movie “Philadelphia”) to “Let It Go” (“Frozen,” 2013). By way of comparison, if we were to randomly pick one nominee from each year, basic probability tells us that our random selections would match the winner in only 23 percent of the years. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Still, this analysis leaves something to be desired. YouTube did not exist until 2005, and while the more popular songs from yesteryear do have more views than their lesser-known contemporaries, it’s not quite fair to compare counts for 1990s songs with those of today. And in the years when the most-watched video did not win the Oscar, we need to make a distinction between the times when the second-most-viewed video won (like 1999, the year the “Prince of Egypt” song “When You Believe,” which has fewer YouTube views than the “Armageddon” song “I Don’t Want to Miss a Thing,” took the prize) and when the least-watched video won (as in 2011, the year “We Belong Together” from “Toy Story 3” triumphed).
