(Photo: Matt York/AP)\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE INDIANAPOLIS — The Indiana House has approved a bill to allow those protected by an order of protection to carry handguns without a license.\nThe measure by Rep. Sean Eberhart passed Tuesday on a 71-26 vote and now heads to the Senate.\nThe Shelbyville Republican says the bill would allow domestic violence victims to protect themselves without waiting for approval of a handgun license.\nDemocrats say the measure is a “Trojan horse” designed to erode reasonable firearms restrictions. They say statistics show many gun owners are killed with their own weapons.\nThe bill also includes a provision calling for a special committee to study the elimination of Indiana’s handgun licensing requirement.\nRepublican Rep. Jim Lucas, Seymour, says doing away with the state’s licensure requirement is his ultimate goal.\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
