When we have the Quran in ourselves, it will shape us to become a more patient and better person,” said the final year student. \nAfter completing his SPM, Ahmad Zahiruddin wanted to pursue studies in chemical science but encouragement from his parents and friends led him to study at Darul Quran instead. \n“I like studying here because the learning schedule is orderly and the lecturers are helpful,” he said. \nHis father Zailani Ahmad, 49, said that having an autistic child made him wary of bullying problems, adding that he was careful about choosing a suitable place for his son. \n“My son is the first autistic student here and I’m very grateful for the co-operation given by the academy,” said Zailani. \n> Sinar Harian reported that a family of five, including three disabled adults, had to survive by eating tubers and fern shoots that grew around their home in Sabak Bernam, Selangor. \nNorazizah Sardi, 47, is the sole breadwinner of her family, which comprised her two disabled children Nor Hafizah Kamaruddin, 26, and Radatul Afida, 23. \nNorazizah is also caring for her mother Seripah Omar, 65, and her disabled younger brother Mohd Yusof Noh Sardi, 26. \n“We eat simple stuff, as long as we can fill our stomachs. Eating tubers and fern shoots is what we have gotten used to. \n“If we want to eat other dishes, sometimes I catch fish from the drain or river,” she said, adding that she usually caught tilapia and snakeheads. \nNorazizah, who has four children, said her husband was working in Rawang, as was her youngest daughter Nor Amiera, 21. \n> Found in translation is compiled from the vernacular newspapers (Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese and Tamil dailies).
