They went out and gave it to the guy. \n“A friend of mine said he saw them pointing the gun at the man as well. They left about half an hour later and then an ambulance came.” Watch | Race-relations worker caught on camera being tasered by police 01:13 \nA spokesman for Greater Manchester Police confirmed that the man had been detained before officers realised that the weapon was in fact a folding cane. \nHe added that the man was later released and the incident has been referred to the Force’s professional standards branch to investigate, adding \nSuperintendent Steve Howard, of GMP's City of Manchester Team, said: \"Officers responded quickly to the incident to ensure the safety of the community of Levenshulme. \n\"It has been established that there was no threat and inquiries are ongoing to fully understand the circumstances of the incident. \n\"In line with standard procedure on occasions such as this, a referral has been made to GMP's Professional Standards Branch.\" Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T22:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T17:22:28.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
