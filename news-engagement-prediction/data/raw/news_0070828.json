He was kind and loving and encouraged me in everything I did, which is why I’m so torn apart by his actions, I didn’t expect it. \n“Our relationship was happy, strong and amazing despite anything these horrid girls have said. I refuse to let it turn what was real for me into a lost cause. \n\"And I don’t want the past 8 months of my life to be a total waste. S**t happens, even to good people, life goes on, stop the hate and continue your support always.” Marnie fell for Lewis in Celebrity Big Brother last year They were inseparable in the CBB house (Photo: Channel 5) Read More Devastated Marnie Simpson 'smashes up her house' after discovering Lewis Bloor cheated \nLewis Bloor posted a lengthy apology to Twitter on his split from Marnie, which Aaron retweeted and added, \"Why don't you start by paying back some of the 20-25K you sponged off her?\" \nLewis is alleged to have cheated on Marnie with a girl he met after a Drake gig at London's O2 Arena, with Marnie revealing the news of his behaviour on Twitter after seeing a video of him with the other girl. \n\"Didn't really want the whole country to know but looks like that didn't last long,\" she tweeted after the incident. \"Happy Valentine's Day to me. U f**king scumbag!\" \nShe later said: \"Tonight I get the worst feeling I’ve ever experienced when I saw the video of him in bed with the girl. \n\"I can’t actually believe it. I’ve cried, I’ve screamed, I’ve smashed my house up. Every emotion, I’m still in shock. \n\"I’ve never been cheated on until now, it’s the first time I’ve experienced what it feels like, it is awful, it's horrendous.\" Marnie was heartbroken by the cheat claims \nLewis, meanwhile, posted a public apology to Marnie. \nHe wrote: \"I am utterly disappointed in myself for hurting such an amazing girl, she did not deserve any of the pain I have caused. \n\"It was a drunken mistake, a terrible thing I wish I had the courage to just admit my wrong doing so Marnie did not have to find out from these girls. \n\"I was with Marnie for the right reasons. A lot of the stuff that's been said is lies. \n\"Marnie is a great girl and I am clearly a fool for ruining what was something very special.
