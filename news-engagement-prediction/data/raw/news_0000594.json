(Reuters) A major reason why the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) is believed to be finding it difficult to cross the finishing line with ease in the ensuing UP assembly elections is its loss of the Muslim vote since 2014, when it had secured more support from the community than ever before. Winning over the community is essential in a state where the Muslims make up 19.3 per cent of the population. Their vote is now expected to be shared mainly by the Samajwadi Party (SP)- Congress combine and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) with the tilt favouring the former because its chances are perceived to be better.\nThe BJP will rue this shift of preference because it had the support of a sizable section of the Muslims in the parliamentary polls.\nAccording to the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), 10 per cent of the Muslims in Uttar Pradesh voted for the BJP three years ago, evidently because they were impressed by Narendra Modi ’s pitch for development.\nIt is also noteworthy that a large number of Yadavs, who form the SP’s core base of support, and Jatavs, who constitute the BSP’s vote bank, also leaned towards the BJP.\nIt was obviously Modi’s promise of “achhey din” (good days) which acted as an incentive.\nBut the increase in the Muslim preference for the BJP was of greater significance because of the traditionally fraught relations between the minorities and the saffron brotherhood.\nYou May Also Want To Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T20:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T09:43:57.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
