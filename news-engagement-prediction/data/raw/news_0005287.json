Morrisons limited the number of lettuces customers can buy in a bid to stop restaurateurs from buying their entire stock as they struggle to source enough vegetables. There are also limits on baby spinach, mixed leaves, rocket, lollo rossa, cauliflower, broccoli, peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes and even lemon and oranges.

Empty shelves have become commonplace across the UK as growers have been unable to supply supermarkets following an extreme mix of drought followed by flooding and freezing conditions in Spain, while poor conditions have also hit farmers in Italy, Greece and Turkey. Meteorologists have warned if weather does not improve in the coming weeks the problem may continue until April, with customers hit by price rises.

Many have complained about prices nearly tripling in recent weeks, with an aubergine going from 40p to 70p in some outlets.

Not much there to ration though!\" Sarah Morton, from Manchester, tweeted a photo of a Morrisons shelf label stating customers could only buy a maximum of two each. She wrote: \"Why?

A few months back it was 40p.\" Spain normally supplies half the vegetables on the European market during the winter months.

Coos Hessing, a buyer for Hessing Super Fresh, said the situation for lettuce was \"particularly severe\". He said: \"There have simply been too many cold days, and what's most bizarre about this situation is that it has hit all of south-eastern Europe. \"We had seen this before, but you'd need to go back to 15 years ago.\" Lettuces may also be about two-thirds smaller than usual as buyers look to the USA and Egypt to keep supplies from drying up, Mr Hessing said. Fepex, Spain's largest growers' association, said the extreme conditions amounted to a \"force majeure\" and the availability of outdoor-grown vegetables will depend on conditions improving in the coming weeks.
