Chuy’s, with locations in Madeira and Florence, is hiring 170 people for its new restaurant in West Chester Township that's scheduled to open April 4 at 9538 Civic Center Blvd. in the Streets of West Chester shopping center. Enlarge Chuy’s, with locations in Madeira and Florence, is hiring 170 people for its West… more Hiring, which started Monday, will continue 9 a.m.-6 p.m. weekdays and 9 a.m.-4 p.m. Saturdays for the next two weeks at Homewood Suites by Hilton, 9226 Schulze Drive, West Chester. On March 6, Chuy’s hiring office will move to an existing Streets of West Chester storefront, according to Doug Scherbauer , area supervisor for the restaurant chain’s Ohio locations. For information, call 512-993-5521. Full-time and part-time positions include servers, kitchen staff, hosts, bussers, bartenders and front-of-the-house hosts, Scherbauer said. “Chuy’s is known for our dedication to great food but also incredible service. That’s why we’re looking for team members who are passionate about food, have positive attitudes and come to work to have fun,” said local owner/operator Ron Carson , who opened Ohio’s first Chuy’s in Madeira in August 2013. The new Chuy’s is part of an expansion to the Streets of West Chester that includes Holtman’s Donuts, Matt the Miller’s Tavern and Duluth Trading Co. The expansion is just off Interstate 75’s Union Centre Boulevard interchange and next to Topgolf and Main Event Entertainment, two attractions that opened last year. Founded in 1982, Chuy’s has 82 locations nationwide, including four in Ohio. Chuy’s menu features family recipes from South Texas, New Mexico and Mexican border towns and includes made-from-scratch dishes made from hand-rolled tortillas cooked on a traditional comal in the dining room and homemade signature sauces ranging from mild Tomatillo to spicy Hatch Green Chile. The restaurant’s atmosphere will incorporate design elements unique to Chuy’s including an Elvis Shrine, a hubcap-covered ceiling, metal palm trees, a “school” of hand-carved wooden fish and the La Chihuahua Bar, which will feature framed pictures of local dogs. Hours will be 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m.-11 p.m. Friday and Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:17:42.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
