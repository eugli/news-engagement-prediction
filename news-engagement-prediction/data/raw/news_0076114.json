And now the musical film's leading lady, Emma Stone , has given her reaction to the surreal moment. Speaking to reporters in the winners' room backstage at the 89th Academy Awards, Emma said: \"I don't know if this is a measurable question, but is that the craziest Oscar moment of all time? Cool! Guys we made history tonight, craziest moment!\" \nWant to watch the Oscars? Here's how! \nEmma, who earlier that night picked up Best Actress for her role in La La Land , said: \"I think everyone's in a state of confusion still, excitement but confusion, so I don't really have a gauge of the atmosphere quite yet. I need to check in, but I think everyone is just so excited for Moonlight . It's such an incredible film.\" She went on to praise the coming-of-age drama, saying: \"I love Moonlight , God I love Moonlight so much. I am so excited for Moonlight , and of course it was an amazing thing to hear La La Land . I think we all would have loved to win Best Picture, but we are so excited for Moonlight . I think it's one of the best films of all time, so I was pretty beside myself.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:13:03.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
