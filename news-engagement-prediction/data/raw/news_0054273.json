Pic/AFP \nTeam India skipper Virat Kohli has been in subliminal form. He has scored four double tons in four consecutive Test series and broken several other records in recent times.\nHe is currently number 2 in the ICC Test rankings with 895 points just behind Australian captain Steve Smith.\nHe is also no. 2 in another list too.\nAccording to a report published by 'Duff & Phelps' in October 2016, Kohli has moved up from the fourth position to be ranked number 2 in the list of Indian celebrities with the highest brand value and is now behind only Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nVirat Kohli has hit four double tons in four consecutive seres \nAccording to the report, the 28-year-old cricketer's brand value is likely to have gone up by 20-25 per cent when he was appointed captain of India's One Day International and Twenty20 teams and it is likely to increase even more, especially if his ongoing purple patch continues, The Hindustan Times quoted sports marketing executives as suggesting.\nKohli's current brand value is pegged at USD 92 million, second only to Shah Rukh's at USD 131 million, according to an October 2016 report on Indiaâ€™s most valued celebrity brands published by Duff & Phelps, a global valuation and corporate finance advisory firm.\n\nNumero Uno, but for how long? \nOf course, since the report was based on 2016 figures, Kohli' value may have gone up by now.\nKohli has now scored double centuries in four consecutive series and in 2016-17 season, scored the most Test runs by an Indian in a home test season (1206) with four matches still to go.\nKohli recently set an endorsement record by signing a Rs 100-crore deal with Puma, becoming the first Indian sportsperson to bag such a huge deal with one brand.\n\nVirat Kohli \n\"The track record of a sports player has a direct bearing on his attractiveness as a brand endorser. Given the consistent and unbeatable record of Virat Kohli, companies that want to position themselves as a market winner will definitely look to sign him on as a brand ambassador,\" the website quoted Aviral Jain, director at Duff & Phelps, as saying.\nInterestingly, Kohli, who replaced MS Dhoni as captain of the Indian limited-overs team recently, overtook the World Cup-winning skipper to become the top-ranked Indian cricketer in the list.\n\nMahendra Singh Dhoni (R) and captain Virat Kohli  \nDhoni, who was previously ranked 3 in the list, moved down the ladder to be ranked no 9 with a brand value of USD 31.1 million, the report added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:07:55.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
