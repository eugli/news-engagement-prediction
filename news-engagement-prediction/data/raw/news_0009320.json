In a shocking incident, a girl studying in a medical institution near Kottayam on Wednesday suffered serious burn injuries after a youth set her and himself on fire for allegedly spurning his love. Adarsh, a native of Neendakara in Kollam, set himself ablaze while hugging the girl allegedly after chasing with a can of petrol, police said. The girl is a fourth year physiotherapy student at Mahatma Gandhi University's School of Medical Education (SME). She was admitted at the Government Medical College Hospital with 60 per cent burn injuries. Adarsh, a former student of the SME's Arpookara campus, is also admitted at the same hospital with 75 per cent burn injuries. Two other students of the institute, have suffered minor burn injuries following their efforts to save the girl and the youth from the fire, police said. According to police, a 2013 batch student, came to the SME today to enquire about the date of the supplementary examination for his failed subject. Adarsh, who had professed his love for the girl, went to her classroom at 11 am and requested her to come out for a chat. But the girl allegedly turned down his request. Infuriated by the rejection, Adarsh poured petrol from the can on her when she got out of the class at around 1 pm. He also chased her when she tried to flee ran away. He later got hold of the girl near the library of the institute hugged her forcefully and lit a matchstick, setting them both on fire, police said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T09:49:25.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
