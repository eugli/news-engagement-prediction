Nearly two hours into the pre-show parade of sequins, diamonds, and tulle, Brandon Maxwell posted an Instagram featuring Syrian refugee Hala Kamil, the subject of the Oscar-nominated short documentary Watani: My Homeland . She stepped out onto the red carpet in a custom velvet purple top and black skirt made by the designer, a moment he shared with his followers and captioned with a beautiful sentiment. In part it read, “To me, every woman is a star and every star has a story.” While there are sure to be many more political statements made (including the ACLU blue ribbon wearers ) both on the carpet and onstage, Maxwell’s bold and powerful message to Kamil on her very first Oscar night will undoubtedly be one of the most memorable. On a night typically reserved for bling, glamour, and off-the-runway style, it was uplifting to see Kamil on the carpet and refreshing to know that Maxwell was so honored to dress her for the occasion. He finished his Instagram note to the mother of four with this: “She used to stay up with her husband every year and watch the Oscars from her home in Aleppo, which has now been destroyed, and tonight she walks the carpet. I hope she is having the time of her life.” In This Story: Oscars ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:53:43.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
