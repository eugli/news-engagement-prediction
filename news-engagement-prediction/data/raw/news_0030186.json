I don’t care about her nudes or sexual history and no one should,” Ratajkowski tweeted. “Gender specific attacks are disgusting sexist bulls**t.” \nAccording to the Times, the reporter in question doesn’t cover politics or Washington and was at a party for New York Fashion Week when she made the statement. Still, the Times called the remark “completely inappropriate.” \n“At a party last night, a Times reporter who does not cover Washington or politics, referred to an unfounded rumor regarding Melania Trump,” a Times spokesperson told Politico. “The comment was not intended to be public, but it was nonetheless completely inappropriate and should not have occurred. Editors have talked to the reporter in question about the lapse.” \nHowever, the Times did not specify what actions they took against the reporter or if the reporter will remain employed with the Times. \nTrump is currently embroiled in two lawsuits. First, Trump has sued England-based online newspaper the Daily Mail for libel after the company last year published a rumor that Trump used to be a high-end escort. Trump is suing the company for $150 million. \nTrump has also sued Maryland-based blogger Webster Griffin for publishing similar rumors about her past. The first lady originally filed the suits in Septrmber 2016. \nStill, Trump is just happy that Ratajkowski stood up and defended her. \n“Applause to all women around the world who speak up, stand up and support other women! @emrata #PowerOfEveryWoman #PowerOfTheFirstLady,” Trump tweeted from the official “FLOTUS” Twitter account late Monday. Applause to all women around the world who speak up, stand up and support other women! @emrata #PowerOfEveryWoman #PowerOfTheFirstLady", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:45:14.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
