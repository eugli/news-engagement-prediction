But exposure to phenoxyethanol has been linked to conditions such as eczema, as well as respiratory health problems. When Which? inspected the ingredients list of 14 popular brands of baby wipes, some of those it looked at contained a staggering 18 different ingredients While development of these conditions is rare, and in wipes phenoxyethanol is used at levels deemed to be safe by the EU, it would still make sense to avoid exposing your child to this controversial preservative, however small the dose, and especially if there is a family history of asthma, or other respiratory issues. Yet, that’s easier said than done. Of the 14 brands of wipes that Which? looked at, half contained phenoxyethanol. With baby wipes regularly marketed as being ‘mild’ and ‘gentle’, and with words such as ‘pure’ and ‘sensitive’ often used on packaging, consumers might be forgiven for thinking they are buying a product that has little more impact than using water. But there are other ingredients to be wary of. Chemicals such as malic acid — found in Huggies Pure Baby Wipes — which is often used to control the pH of a skincare product. Skin is slightly acidic and so if a cosmetic is naturally alkaline, acids may be added to it so that it is closer to the natural pH of skin. However, it can cause skin irritation and redness, especially in people with sensitive skin. Then there’s propylene glycol —in both Tesco’s fragranced and unfragranced wipes — which attracts water to the skin and is used as a moisturising ingredient, but has, in some tests, been shown to be a skin irritant. Benzyl alcohol — in Pampers New Baby Sensitive wipes — is a preservative that may irritate skin; and tocopheryl acetate — in Sainsbury’s Little Ones Eco Fragrance Free wipes — is also believed by some to cause skin irritation. For many, these ingredients may cause no problems at all, but parents of children with sensitive skin may want to avoid them. For many, the ingredients may cause no problems at all, but parents of children with sensitive skin may want to avoid them It’s also worth checking the order of the ingredients list; the higher the chemicals feature, then the more of them there will be in the product. You might also think that labels such as ‘hypoallergenic,’ ‘all natural’ and ‘dermatologically tested’ would give you a shortcut to products that won’t cause problems. Not so says Nikki Stopford, at Which?. ‘These terms do not conform to external standards and are essentially marketing words that don’t mean anything objective. If you really want to know what wipes contain, it’s better to consult the list on the pack.’ Another ingredient that people often want to avoid is fragrance, which is widely known to be one of the most common causes of allergic skin reactions. But it’s not as simple as looking for something that claims to be ‘fragrance-free’. Confusingly, even if baby wipes are labelled as fragrance-free, they could contain fragrances that are being used as preservatives ‘Confusingly, even if baby wipes are labelled as fragrance-free, they could contain fragrances that are being used as preservatives,’ explains Dr David Orton, a consultant dermatologist and spokesman for the British Association of Dermatologists. Baby wipes may also contain botanical extracts, such as camomile, that will give a fragrance to the product. ‘In Europe, only 26 fragrance chemicals need to be individually named out of the approximate 2,000 fragrance chemicals that the industry could use in a cosmetic product, which is how baby wipes are classified in the EU,’ says Dr Orton. ‘Almost all other fragrance chemicals are included on ingredients listings under the name “parfum” which is an umbrella term that refers to an undisclosed mixture of various chemicals,’ he adds. So what should you be looking for if you want to avoid any ingredient that might aggravate your baby’s skin? According to Dr Orton, ‘bland is best’ so you’re better off looking for products with the shortest list of ingredients. But that’s not always straightforward. Of the 14 wipes Which? looked at, all but two had 12 ingredients or more. One of those with a short ingredients list is Huggies Pure, which still contains malic acid, one of the potential skin irritants highlighted by the Which? report. The other, WaterWipes, contains just two ingredients: 99.9 per cent water and 0.1 per cent grapefruit seed extract. This sounds great, but don’t forget wipes are 80 per cent polyester, which, if flushed down the loo, can block drains, introduce plastic to the food chain and won’t break down in landfill for centuries. So if you’re worried about your baby’s skin, and the environment, you might want to consider another solution. Cheeky Wipes (£39.99 for a starter kit, cheekywipes.com) might initially sound more expensive than your average regular £2 pack of wipes, but £40 buys you 25 reusable cloths that you moisten using the oil and water solution provided, as well as bags and containers to transport clean and used wipes. And here's what they all are... Tesco Loves Baby 64 Fragranced Ultra Soft Wipes So what do all the ingredients in a baby wipe actually DO? We analysed Tesco Loves Baby Fragranced Ultra Soft Wipes, one of the brands that Which? identified as containing 18 ingredients. Aqua: water, the basis of many cosmetic products. Cetearyl Isononanoate: fatty acid, this waxy substance has a conditioning effect on skin, but in one study, repeated use caused dermatitis. Glycerin: a humectant moisturising factor that occurs naturally in the skin. Ceteareth-20: an emollient and emulsifier that helps soften skin but also helps other ingredients dissolve. Some are concerned it can enhance the skin’s absorption of harmful ingredients and suggest it isn’t used on broken skin Cetearyl alcohol: helps to thicken a liquid and also prevent oils and water from separating. Glyceryl stearate: acts as a lubricant on the skin’s surface, prevents water loss and helps the ‘spreadability’ of the product. Ceteareth-12: works as an emulsifier. Polysorbate 20: a multi-tasking ingredient that can help emulsify other ingredients, but is also a surfactant, a form of cleanser. Parfum: could be any of a number of compounds — or, in fact, a combination of compounds — added to give the product some fragrance. Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice: a soothing and hydrating ingredient often included when manufacturers want to claim products contain natural ingredients. Chamomilla Recutita Flower Extract: chamomile extract which can have skin-soothing tendencies although those with allergies to plants in the daisy family may also be allergic to products containing chamomile. Disodium EDTA: a type of preservative that stops cosmetics deteriorating or discolouring. Propylene Glycol: a humectant which attracts water to the skin, and also helps other ingredients dissolve, but has, in some tests, been shown to be a skin irritant. Sodium Citrate: an acid used to help adjust the pH of a product. Phenoxyethanol: a preservative linked to conditions including eczema as well as respiratory health problems. Benzoic Acid: used as a preservative in cosmetics and food. Dehydroacetic Acid: a synthetic preservative that helps to prevent the growth of fungi. Citric Acid: an acid used to help adjust the pH of a product. A Tesco spokesman said: ‘There’s nothing more important than the quality and safety of our products. Ultra Soft Wipes have been rigorously tested to ensure they comply with quality and safety standards.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:31:27.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
