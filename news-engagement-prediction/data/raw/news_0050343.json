HCL, Infosys, Wipro corporate governance is in autopilot mode,” she added. The young hotshot CEO of India’s fourth largest information technology services company HCL Technologies, Roshni Nadar, said on Wednesday that a severe conflict of opinion with the board is unlikely as there is one family which controls the business, amid the ongoing tussle between the bellwether Infosys founders and its board over corporate governance issues. “HCL and Wipro are largely controlled by one family so a strife with the board is not possible,” she told ET Now. She further said that Infosys founders are admirable industry leaders and there to stay. “I want HCL Corporation to have a conglomerate structure like the Tatas. HCL, Infosys, Wipro corporate governance is in autopilot mode,” she added.\nHCL Technologies last month reported a 7.8 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 2,070 crore for the third quarter ended December 2016. It had posted a net profit of Rs 1,920 crore in the year-ago period, it said in a BSE filing. Consolidated revenues grew 14.2 per cent to Rs 11,814 crore in October-December as against Rs 10,341 crore in the same quarter of 2015-16. In dollar terms, the company’s net profit increased 5.2 per cent to $306 million in the reported quarter while revenues grew 11.4 per cent to $1.74 billion.\nThe company had guided for its 2016-17 revenues to grow 12-14 per cent (based on average exchange rates for 2016-17), which translates into 10-12 per cent in USD terms based on December 31, 2016 exchange rates. “We expect our FY17 revenues to be in the middle of this range,” the company said. It added that the acquisitions and IP-led partnerships announced after September 30, 2016, are likely to additionally contribute 0.6-1 per cent in revenues, depending on the date of consummation of the Geometric deal.\nAlso watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:25:01.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
