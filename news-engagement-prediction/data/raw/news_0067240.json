Follow him here .\nFeb 25, USA Today Sports It’s hard to believe it’s been almost three weeks since the New England Patriots’ epic comeback in Super Bowl 51 . Down 28-3 as the third quarter neared its end, Tom Brady and the Pats somehow scored 31 unanswered to win the game in overtime.\nSo, what happened? Was it the magic of Brady and Bill Belichick? Did the Falcons just choke when all eyes were on them? Or was there some other force at play?\nAs Falcons veteran wide receiver Mohamed Sanu sees it, perhaps the Super Bowl halftime show played a role in the reversal of fortunes.\nThe halftime show gets bigger and longer every year, and Lady Gaga’s grandiose performance this year was quite lengthy.\nRelated Best Super Bowl Ever?

Watt Gives Speedy Morman a Workout and Makes Super Bowl LI Prediction More People Bet On Browns to Win Super Bowl LI Than Falcons “It definitely (affected us) because usually halftime is only, like, 15 minutes. So when you’re not on the field for an hour, it’s like going to work out, having a great workout, sitting on the couch for an hour and then trying to work out again,” Sanu said in an interview with NFL.com .\nSanu did not seem to be looking for excuses, though. He said the team won’t be defined by their Super Bowl collapse, and he was unwilling to put the blame on his former offensive coordinator, Kyle Shanahan.\nSanu’s point would hold more steam if the halftime show happened between the third and fourth quarters. Atlanta wasn’t all that bad in the third quarter, in which they outscored New England 7-6.\nTags: News , Atlanta Falcons , Super Bowl LI", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/aaroncmansfield", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000787646/article/sanu-falcons-wont-be-defined-by-fourth-quarter-of-super-bowl", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/wM7wB9d-yFM"], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:54:33.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
