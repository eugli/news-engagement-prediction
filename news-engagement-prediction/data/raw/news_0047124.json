I try to be as good as possible to make them happy, to satisfy them. Anthony Martial has started in Manchester United's last three games. \n\"What I want is to stay at this club for as long as possible.\" \nMartial admits he has struggled at times to reach the standards he set for United during his first season at the club, but acknowledges he is still developing as a player. \nAsked why his form had dropped, he said: \"It is just because last year I played a lot, I had the possibility to play back-to-back games. Now I enjoy playing and we have to wait. \n\"I work very hard and I am surrounded by great players, I try to learn and hopefully next season will be better. Indeed I started as a centre-forward but even in Monaco I was a winger. As long as I'm on the pitch I'm happy.\" \nFollow @ESPNFC on Twitter to keep up with the latest football updates.
