In fact, you shouldn’t be in this country at all.” \nShahid, an attorney, told the newspaper she has lived in Scotland all her life. \nShe said 10 to 12 people witnessed the incident but did not speak up as MacKinnon, also an attorney, accosted her and insulted her son. \nSo she began filming him. This is the vile person we encountered and who swore directly at my son and thought he could get away with it... https://t.co/SGHlDhzeWE — Sanaa Shahid (@sanaashahid) February 4, 2017 \nIn the clip, above, MacKinnon can be heard complaining into the phone about Shahid and saying “it’s my word against hers.” \nThat’s when a rail worker arrived. \n“Now it’s not just your word against hers,” the Virgin Trains rail worker said. “It’s mine as well, because I heard it all.” \n“Yea, I wanted you to,” the man replied. \n“I’m not going to accept it,” the worker said. “You’re drunk and racist and you need to get off the train.” \nMacKinnon can be seen later eating, drinking what appears to be wine straight from the bottle and ― after the train reaches the next station ― getting up to leave, but not without taking a parting shot at Shahid. \n“You’re so wonderful, wasting police time, miss,” he said. “And your fucking son.” \nOn Twitter, Shahid publicly thanked the rail worker. Highest praise for the train manager on 2.30pm train from London Euston to Glasgow -29/12/2016 when we were racially targeted @VirginTrains", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:30:37.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
