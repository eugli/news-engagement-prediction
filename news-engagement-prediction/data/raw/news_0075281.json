(Photo: Jesse Johnson, USA TODAY Sports) 30 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTORONTO â€” Toronto Raptors point guard Kyle Lowry has a right wrist injury that could sideline him for an extended period. \nCoach Dwane Casey announced before the game against the Boston Celtics on Friday night that the All-Star guard would miss the contest after having X-rays and would have further evaluation over the weekend. \n\"That's a huge blow for us,\" Casey said. \"I don't know how long he's going to be out. It's not going to be a one-day thing.\" \nCasey confirmed Lowry was hurt in a victory over the Charlotte Hornets on Feb. 15, the team's final game before the All-Star weekend. Though the club thought the wrist would get better with rest and treatment during the All-Star break in New Orleans, that has not been the case. \nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.
