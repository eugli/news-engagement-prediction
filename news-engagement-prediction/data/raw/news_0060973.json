Spice laughed the question off. \n“I think Hollywood is known for being rather far to the left in its opinions, and I’ve got to be honest with you, I think the president will be hosting the Governors’ Ball that night,” said Spicer. “The first lady’s put a lot of time into this event, welcoming our nation's governors to the Capital, and I have a feeling that that’s where the president and the first lady are going to be focused on Sunday night.” \nIn the past, Trump has tweeted such criticisms about the Oscars like, \"This is Amateur Night - who the hell is in charge of this production?\" and \"I don't know how much longer I can take this bullshit - so terrible! #Oscars.\" \nAnd that was before Meryl Streep and a number of other celebrities laid into him during their time onstage at other awards shows this season, which has been happening often lately. Streep's Golden Globes speech also got a hate tweet from Trump the day after. This is Amateur Night - who the hell is in charge of this production? #Oscars — Donald J.
