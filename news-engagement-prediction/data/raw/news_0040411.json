Studios to adapt the comic company’s action thriller Talent . \nMoritz and Original Films banner picked up Talent via their discretionary fund and out of turnaround from Universal, where it was previously set up. \nThe comic tells of a college professor who is the sole survivor of a plane wreck and who slowly discovers he's inherited the abilities of the passengers who've died. He puts his new talents to use as he finds himself chased down by members of a shadowy conspiracy. \nIt was created by created and written by Christopher Golden ( Baltimore ) and Tom Sniegoski ( Fallen ) and illustrated by Paul Azaceta ( Outcast ). \nProducing with Moritz will be Original’s Toby Jaffe. Boom! CEO and founder Ross Richie and president of development Stephen Christy are producing for Boom! The latter’s vp Adam Yoelin is executive producing. \nBoom! has a first-look deal with Fox but Talent is the first project to find a home outside that relationship. Moritz has a first-look deal with Sony where he produces movies such as the 22 Jump Street movies, among others, so Talent could eventually land there. \nThe activity on Talent also shows how Boom! continues to mine its deep catalog as the title, as well as Mouse Guard and Irredeemable , both of which are in development at Fox, are comics that were first published over five years ago. That goes against industry norms where rights to comics and books tend to be acquired even before they are published. \nBoom! is in post on The Empty Man , the adaptation of its supernatural thriller comic that stars James Badge Dale. \nMoritz is coming off of Passengers , the sci-fi movie that starred Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, and is a producer on The Fate of the Furious , the latest Fast & Furious i nstallment that hits screens April 14.
