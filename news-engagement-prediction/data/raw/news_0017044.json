Image: Stan Schroeder/Mashable/YouTube By Stan Schroeder 2017-02-07 10:28:28 UTC \nYouTube has released an update to its mobile app that will likely make a lot of users very happy: You can now skip 10 seconds forward or backward in a video by double tapping the right or left edge of your phone's screen. \nPerfect for those quick replays or just skipping a boring portion of the video, the feature is in many cases vastly better than fiddling with the video's slider on the bottom, especially when you're in a hurry. SEE ALSO: YouTube is playing around with video thumbnails that move like GIFs \nThe feature also lets you skip 20 or 30 seconds — Android Authority says these are invoked with a triple or quadruple tap, but I could only get it with a quadruple and quintuple tap, both of which are incredibly hard to get right. Hopefully Google's YouTube dev team will conjure a better way for those longer skips; for now, I recommend you stick to the good old double tap which is the only one that works well. \nBy the way, a similar feature — a 5-second skip — is also available on the browser version of YouTube; just hit the left or right arrow while the video is playing. \nThe feature actually went live for a portion of users late last week, as documented in this Reddit post , but it appears to be widely available now. It's available for both iOS and Android . ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:39:30.680+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
