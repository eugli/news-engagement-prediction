(Photo: Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — In his first address to the media since becoming commissioner of the PGA Tour, Jay Monahan said two weeks ago no one would break 60 in the Farmers Insurance Open. \nSmart man. \nIndeed, no player at Torrey Pines Golf Resort threatened 60, as champion Jon Rahm shot the lowest round on the beast otherwise known as the South (65) and Justin Rose carded the low round on the North (also 65). \nWell, Monahan’s prediction will hold this week as well in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, where players will be hard pressed to dial up 59 such as the ones Justin Thomas and Adam Hadwin signed for in the first three weeks of Monahan’s tenure. \nHard by the Pacific Ocean and exposed to Mother Nature’s wrath, the three courses in play — Pebble Beach, Spyglass Hill and the Shore Course at Monterey Peninsula Country Club — will not be gentle. \nRoaring winds, sideways rain and chilly temperatures marred Tuesday’s practice rounds and the forecast shows more of the same until the sun is expected to make an appearance Saturday. Tack on soft ground, sodden rough and 6-hour rounds, reaching 59 will demand a herculean effort. \nMORE GOLF: Steve Stricker relishing role as PGA Tour veteran \nThus it’s very unlikely the list of sub-60 rounds will get an addition this week as scoring binges go dry. Hadwin’s 59 was the ninth sub-60 in Tour history — the sixth since 2010 — and the third in six months. Jim Furyk shot the lowest round in history with a 58 at the Travelers Championship in August. \nThere was also a 60 and two 61s shot at the Sony Open the week Thomas carded his 59 en route to the all-time 72-hole record of 253. A few weeks before Furyk’s historic round, Stephan Jaeger posted a 58 on the Web.com Tour in the Ellie Mae Classic. \nNumerous factors have united to produce regular 59 watches in the age of the routine 300-yard drive. Equipment advances with golf balls and clubs have allowed players to gain more control despite achieving eye-opening distance. Weight training and physical fitness routines are commonplace among many players. Playing surfaces are immaculate with continued improvement in agronomy. \nPortable launch monitors deliver immediate data to tap into. And more course setups feature manageable rough, inviting pin placements and benign bunkers. Add in a lack of wind and 59 is in play. \nAll of which has led to many wondering if the game has become too easy for the best players in the world. \nMonahan is not among those people. \n“I tend to look at (the low scores) as a positive. Those are super human feats,” he said. “ … I think a 59 rises us up and pulls more people into the PGA Tour, so I look at it as a positive.” \nJordan Spieth doesn't think 59 has lost its luster. He said any round that ends with a score that starts with a 5 remains illustrious. \n“You see guys go 6 under through nine holes. That happens a number of times, but to be able to continue to push yourself, and continue to hit the shots necessary, and not really be a human for the rest of that round, you know what I mean? Not have the flaws in your brain and stay dead focused on continuing to make that lower and lower and being OK with that and embracing that is so tough,” Spieth said. “That's why you don't see it very often. You've got to get normally a couple good breaks or obviously make some putts, but mentally you have to be so strong that round in order to do it. That's why there aren't that many, and it's incredible. \n“Mr. 58 will be Mr. 58, but 59 will stay just as significant, I imagine.” \nFor now. \nPHOTOS: 2016-17 PGA TOUR TOURNAMENT WINNERS Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:01:18.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
