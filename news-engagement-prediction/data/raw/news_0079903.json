Responding to US reports that India had issued a demarche (diplomatic protest) to the US, MEA spokesperson said on Tuesday, US actions had \"obviated the need for a demarche by the Government on this matter.\" \n\nMEA spokesperson, Gopal Baglay , detailed the actions, which included a commitment by the US to \"investigate thoroughly and prosecute the case. This approach is reflected in the sentiments and assurances from senior most authorities of Kansas ...\" \n\nThe Indian remarks followed the first reactions by the Trump White House to the killing, the timing of which was criticized in the US. \"I don't want to get ahead of the law enforcement, but ... while the story is evolving, early reports out of Kansas are equally disturbing,\" Trump's press secretary Sean Spicer said. Spicer had earlier rejected any connection between the strident tones of the election campaign with the crime. \n\nMEA's statements come even as foreign secretary S. Jaishankar heads into meetings with his counterpart Tom Shannon in Washington. Jaishankar is expected to hold meetings with senior leaders of the US Congress, where he is expected to sensitize them on the safety and security issues of the large Indian community in the US. \n\nBaglay indicated this when he said, \"It is important to note that the US authorities are engaged with us on the larger concern regarding safety of Indians in the US, a matter which continues to receive the Government's top priority.\" The Indian government also made a special point of applauding the \"noble and courageous gesture of the young American Mr. Ian Grillot, who risked his life while countering the shooter.\" \n\nThe MEA's seemingly conciliatory tone was offset by strong words by I&B minister Venkaiah Naidu who reflected popular outrage after the killing, which is now being investigated as a hate crime. \"USA should respond to this incident. American President and people of America, they should come out openly to condemn such actions... and then take strongest action. \"These kind of incidents involving racial discrimination are shameful,\" Naidu said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T03:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:55:57.867+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
