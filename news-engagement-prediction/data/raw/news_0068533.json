The announcement has come as a shock to many Kiwis, especially the 350 workers whose jobs are on the line. \nREAD MORE: ​ * Mondelez's global $4 billion cost-cutting drive behind Dunedin Cadbury factory closure \nIn a bid to stop Mondelez from shutting down the factory, Kiwis have started social media campaigns calling on people to boycott the corporation's products, which range from Kraft peanut butter to Moccona coffee. \nA \" Boycott Cadbury NZ \" Facebook page was set up in the wake of the announcement and has been liked almost 1000 times. And a change.org petition, \" Cadbury reconsider closure of your Dunedin factory \", was started on Saturday and has almost 1000 signatures. #Dunedin my #Hometown . When #Kraft etc close factories like @Cadbury_NZ , they save, while ripping the guts out of a community & its history Ad Feedback \nViviana Gage wrote: \"I went to newworld (sic) today, and as I walked pass the chocolates, I imagine myself pulling off the shelves every single cadbury bar, and stomping on it as they lied on the floor...\" \nAnother Facebook user, Darryn Turner, wrote: \"I love Cadbury but yeah it's for a good cause that we don't purchase.\" \nThe boycott isn't likely to be more than a drop in the ocean for the food giant, which announced the factory closure as part of a $4 billion international cost-cutting drive. \n* Comments on this story are now closed. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:06:00.151+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
