For years now, people have speculated that Janet Jackson gave birth to a secret daughter 31 years ago when she was married to James DeBarge . { \"position1\" : { \"type\" : \"artist\", \"id\" : 29436, \"name\" : \"Janet Jackson\" } } \nNow, James' mother, Etterlene DeBarge , is revealing that these reports are factual. While speaking to Inside Edition , the former mother-in-law of Janet's admitted that she's met the secret daughter of the \"Rhythm Nation\" singer. \"I know there's a daughter out there somewhere,\" Etterlene said. \nShe added that she's been contacted by several women over the years who claim to be her granddaughter. These women turned out to be frauds. Then one day, a woman from Philadelphia contacted Etterlene. “I told her, the proof is in the pudding let's go get a DNA test,” she told the mystery lady. Inside Edition obtained this DNA test and the probability of relatedness was 96.7%. \nEtterlene met the 31-year-old woman, who's name is Tiffany , at an airport in Michigan last year. She strongly believe that Tiffany is the secret daughter of Janet and DeBarge. Etterlene thinks she's finally found her hidden granddaughter! \nWe can't believe this!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:07:25.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
