Leila de Lima returned to the Senate Thursday night to wait for the police team that would serve an arrest warrant to her. \nDe Lima said she decided to come back to the Senate because she did not want her family to see her being arrested at her home in Paranaque City. \n“I don’t want the to see me being arrested,” she told reporters at the Senate. ADVERTISEMENT \nWhile reiterating that she would not evade the arrest, De Lima expressed hope that the arresting team would not force arresting her tonight inside the chamber. \n“Dito po ako maghihintay sa kanila, pero sana po huwag nilang pilitin na arestuhin kaaagad ako ngayon pagdating nila dito. Dapat maghintay lang sila sa labas,” she said. \n(“I will wait for them here, but I hope they won’t force arresting me as soon as they arrive here. They should just wait outside.”) \n“Hindi po nilang pwedeng pilitin, and then they will serve the warrant on me while I’m here in the office when I’m not yet ready to face them,” the senator added. \n(“They can’t force it, and then they will serve the warrant on me while I’m here in the office when I’m not yet read to face them.”) \nDe Lima said it would be “very unusual” and “unjust” to force her arrest this evening when it could be done in the daytime on Friday. \nShe said she would also feel “less safe” if the arrest would be done at night. \nThe warrant of arrest was issued by the Muntinlupa   against the senator over her alleged involvement on illegal drugs, which she vehemently denied. /atm", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:22:42.182+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
