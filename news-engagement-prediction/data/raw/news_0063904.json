Trust us. As Brooklyn-based makeup artist Katie Jane Hughes says, \"Yellow is only a few shades lighter than brown.\" See, when she puts it like that, our theory makes sense, right? Hughes has been experimenting with the vibrant color lately, and her Instagram posts have us throughly convinced us that yes, as crazy as it sounds, we need to try yellow eye shadow for spring. And frankly, you should, too. It's bold without looking clownish, modern and cheery, and not at all sickly.

If you want to ease into yellow eye shadow, though, Hughes recommends opting for a buttery pastel shade if you have a fair skin. For deeper skin tones, an amber pigment would work best. Lauren Leonard, a Chicago-based makeup artist, agrees. \"Yellow is actually one of my least favorite colors, but I would always be drawn to the idea of wearing it on my eyes,\" she says. After looking on the Internet for inspiration, she realized yellow is a great color to use on every skin tone. Visual proof below.
