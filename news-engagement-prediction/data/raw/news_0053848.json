A fight had broken out among passengers, and one woman refused to exit the vehicle, according to a Larimer County sheriff’s news release. \nFighting spilled outside the Uber vehicle, and the driver got out to restore order. A woman who had remained inside the vehicle locked the doors and drove off through a yard, striking a retaining wall, a tree and other landscaping. \nThe Uber driver had to jump out of the way of his own vehicle to escape injury, according to the release. The woman who took off in the Uber vehicle was allegedly “very intoxicated.” \nSheriff’s deputies and Fort Collins police spotted the vehicle, with heavy front-end damage, at North College Avenue and Myrtle Street and stopped it.
