We should remind our American friends of their own motto: United we stand, divided we fall.\"\nEU unsettled - by Damian Grammaticas, BBC News, Brussels Donald Tusk doesn't speak for European leaders. His role is to chair their debates and focus their minds on the biggest issues facing the EU.\nThe way he always does that is by speaking bluntly.\nWhat's striking is that he's added \"worrying declarations by the new American administration\" to his list of external challenges facing Europe. He does place it lowest, but in Donald Tusk's view the EU is under pressure from all sides.\nPresident Trump has alarmed some European leaders by raising questions about Nato And now, he's saying, the EU can no longer be sure of the support of its biggest ally too.\nDonald Trump has professed doubts about Nato, admiration for Russia's Vladimir Putin and support for Brexit. He has also criticised German Chancellor Angela Merkel, particularly her welcoming policy towards refugees.\nSo Mr Tusk's letter is a sign of how unsettled EU leaders are by Donald Trump, unsure about what his presidency heralds.\nGermany shivers in new wind blowing from US Seven ways the world could change In a recent interview with Germany's Bild newspaper, Mr Trump confirmed his view of the Nato alliance as \"obsolete\". He has also dismissed the EU as \"basically a vehicle for Germany\".\nMrs Merkel was among several European leaders who criticised an executive order signed by Mr Trump of Friday establishing a temporary travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries.\nMr Trump's statements have raised concerns in Europe, along with his views on trade.\nThe Belgian prime minister tweeted: \"The US would be making a mistake by turning its back on Europe. Make America great again... without Europe that cannot succeed.\" During his inauguration speech, the new president accused foreign competitors of \"stealing our companies and destroying our jobs\" and said: \"Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.\"\nLast week, Ted Malloch, the man tipped to be named US ambassador to the EU, made less than flattering remarks about the euro when he told the BBC that the currency could collapse in 18 months.\nOn Tuesday, Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel tweeted that the US \"would be making a mistake if it turned its back on Europe\".\nProfessor Ted Malloch is gloomy about the euro's future", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/F95F/production/_93893836_mediaitem93893833.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/21F0/production/_93888680_1565ae69-b10c-47c6-9540-3d1f86d9f84a.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1549/production/_93894450_b264c3f5-1129-4403-901d-e7e3b4cc9dd3.jpg", "http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/01/31-tusk-letter-future-europe/?utm_source=dsms-auto&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=%22United+we+stand%2c+divided+we+fall%22%3a+letter+by+President+Donald+Tusk+to+the+27+EU+heads+of+state+or+government+on+the+future+of+the+EU+before+the+Malta+summit"], "published": "2017-01-31T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:51:59.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
