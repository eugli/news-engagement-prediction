To me, if you really are [racist], you have to let it slip more than one time. I mean, if you’re really a racist, people have got to see it over and over and over and over and over. \nWhile many would no doubt disagree with the sentiment that racism needs to be continually demonstrated in order to be proven, most in and around the wrestling industry have been quick to come to Hogan’s defense. \n“You do feel a bit let down [by Hulk],” said WWE star Chris Jericho during a 2015 interview with HuffPost Live , “But I know this: Nobody feels more let down than he does. I think he feels very embarrassed and really bad about it.” Chris Jericho [Image by Angela Weiss/Getty Images for Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation] \nMany insiders, for that reason, hope that WWE rumors of a Hulk Hogan return are true. Jimmy Hart, for example, believes that there is room for forgiveness without ever condoning the legend’s statements. \nAnd after two years, Jimmy is beyond hopeful that 2017 might be a year of redemption for the former 12-time WWE and WCW World Champion. \n“We talk every day or every other day,”said Hart, noting that the past few years have been very difficult for his friend. “The devastating thing to Hulk, more than anything, is what happened with his affiliation with here. That’s the thing that has tore him up more than anything.” \nWhile Hart did not comment directly on the WWE rumors regarding his friend, Hart is a huge proponent of Hogan deserving forgiveness and consideration rather than condemnation and further banishment. \nThis week, Cageside Seats reported that there is a modicum of truth to the rumors of Hulk’s return to WWE, which it called “inevitable.” Unfortunately for Hogan’s fans, there came with this news that caveat that it “won’t be any time soon.” \nStill, Hulk Hogan’s fans seem to grow more impatient with each passing day. \nSportskeeda , for example, recently reported that this week’s episode of WWE Raw saw a number of Hulk-related fan signs confiscated from the broadcast, including one that first made it on-air that read “Where’s Hogan?” This news item comes via Sportskeeda .

You’ve had a great career…. WWE still loves you’.” \n“They’ve got to move on and do what’s best for business, best for them,” he continued. \nPerhaps, if WWE rumors do ultimately prove true, Hulk Hogan may finally be on the path to redemption that most feel would be best for all involved. \n[Featured Image by Michael Dodge/AFL Media/Getty Images]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:45:14.611+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
