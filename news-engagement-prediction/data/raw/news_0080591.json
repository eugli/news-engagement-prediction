The Civil Administration said the West Bank-residing mother is not listed as being barred from entering Israel, and that the issue will be investigated.\nMughrabi was arrested on February 9 on suspicion of involvement in a fight in south Tel Aviv with an Eritrean. He was taken to the local Sharett Police Station and detained on the second floor in handcuffs.\nAt some point he jumped from the window, which had been left open, sustaining critical injuries to his head and lungs. He required emergency surgery and is not yet out of danger. Since then, his detention has been extended.\nHe is still anaesthetized and on a respirator in Ichilov Hospital.\nMughrabi is a resident of Tel Aviv, the son of an Israeli father and Palestinian mother – who resides in Bethlehem.\nHis mother requested that she be allowed to visit him in hospital, presenting medical documents attesting to his serious condition. However, she failed to receive an entry permit. According to Mughrabi’s defense attorney, Shmuel Flishman of the Public Defender’s Office, “Even if someone is suspected of being involved in a fight, it’s a disgrace to the State of Israel that they aren’t allowing his mother to be at his side at a time when his life is in danger.”\nFlishman added that he had turned to Police Commissioner Roni Alsheich and to senior police officers in the Tel Aviv District, but has yet to be informed about the events preceding Mughrabi’s jump from the window.\nThe police said that following the incident, “An officer has been appointed to investigate the circumstances. The investigation process has not yet been concluded.”\nYaniv Kubovich\nHaaretz Correspondent \nYaniv Kubovich   Yaniv Kubovich   Yaniv Kubovich\n     Yaniv Kubovich \nSend me email alerts Want  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:38:45.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
