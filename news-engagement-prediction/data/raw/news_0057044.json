Average survival from onset to death is around three to five years. ADVERTISEMENT \nAlthough previously suspected, this environmental risk has now been verified by researchers at Dartmouth College in the United States. The scientists followed 518 patients, 294 of whom had ALS, looking at the type and quality of fish and seafood they ate, how often they ate it, and where they sourced their produce (bought from stores or caught while fishing). \nThe scientists found that 61 percent of people with ALS were in the top 25 percent of estimated mercury intake, compared to 44 percent of participants who did not have ALS. \nAccording to the study, the participants who ate the largest amount of fish and seafood on a regular basis had a two-fold higher risk of ALS compared to participants with lower mercury levels. \nFish to avoid: swordfish, shark, tuna, sea bream \nSwordfish, shark, tuna, sea bream and lamprey are among the predatory fish that contain the highest levels of mercury, which could cause damage to the central nervous system. Fish that are lower down the food chain, like sardines and mackerel, contain lower levels of the metal. \nThe regulatory limit for mercury in fresh fish is 0.5 milligram per kilogram. Meanwhile, previous research has found that organic fish and farmed fish are not spared from the risk of contamination. \nTo ensure significant omega-3 intake while minimizing toxicity, health authorities recommend choosing fish and seafood such as anchovies, capelin, Arctic char, hake, herring, mackerel, white sucker, pollock, salmon, smelt, rainbow trout, vendace, crab, shrimp, clams, mussels and oysters. \nIn the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency regularly updates its advice to pregnant women, children and vulnerable individuals, and notably recommends restricting the intake of certain seafood and fish (tuna and swordfish, in particular). \nThe study will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 69th annual meeting in Boston, from April 22 to 28.
