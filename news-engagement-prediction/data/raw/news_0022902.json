However it only recently launched in the US. And by “recently” we actually mean last month. The device was priced at $599 here in the US, for an unlocked model, which is actually really competitive. And right now, Amazon is offering it even lower, with a price of just $588. Now that’s not a huge discount for this smartphone, especially at that price, but it is definitely one worth taking advantage of. It’s the lowest this device has been so far. \nThose that may be unaware of the Huawei Mate 9, it’s essentially a replacement for the Galaxy Note 7, but without an S Pen. There is a 5.9-inch display, powered by the Kirin 960 processor along with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The Mate 9 does also have a micro SD card slot, allowing you to expand that storage. Additionally, there is a 4000mAh battery inside that keeps the Mate 9 going all day long and then some. What really makes the Mate 9 stand out is the camera. It’s a dual-camera setup, and it’s Leica-branded. There is a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor and then a 16-megapixel color sensor, that makes for some incredible images. \nYou can pick up the Huawei Mate 9 from Amazon right now, using the link below. It is eligible for Amazon Prime, which means you’ll get it even sooner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:44:04.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
