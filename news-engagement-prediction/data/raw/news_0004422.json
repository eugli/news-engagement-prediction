Many in the audience expressed fears about being stopped or even calling police if they were the victim of a crime. \n\"We're your Baltimore police department and we don't care about your immigration status, we will not check your immigration status and we do not have a database to check your immigration status,\" said Davis, whose remarks were translated into Spanish. \nDavis told the crowd to call 911 if they needed the police, and to call a special phone line set up by Maryland's attorney general, Brian Frosh, to report hate crimes. That number is 866-481-8361. \nThat was reassuring to Abraham Tema, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala, who said he considers Baltimore his home now. He wants other members of his community to feel safe and not fear police â€“ as he said he once did several years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T09:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T10:17:15.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
