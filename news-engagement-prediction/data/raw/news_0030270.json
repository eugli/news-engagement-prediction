It just really sort of went downhill from there and didn't make a lot of sense to any of us,\" she said. \n\nPassenger Randy Reiss tweeted throughout the event, at first saying, \"I'm shaking right now. I just left my @united flight 455 'cos the captain demonstrated that she was not mentally in a safe space.\" \n\nShe then mentioned she was going through a divorce, commented on a interracial couple in the first-class section by saying \"yay unity,\" and told Reiss he did not have to fly if he felt uncomfortable, Reiss said. \n\nReiss tweeted a photo of her back in the terminal speaking with two uniformed officers. \n\n\"She was crying. She apologized. I wished her well and said I hope she gets the help she needs,\" Reiss said. \n\nUnited spokesman Charles Hobart said the airline would not comment beyond Saturday's statement. \n\n\"We hold our employees to the highest standards and replaced the pilot with a new one to operate the flight, which has since departed Austin. We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience,\" the statement said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:14:38.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
