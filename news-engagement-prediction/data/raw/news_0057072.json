Minutes of the last Federal Reserve interest-rate meeting left members interested in hiking interest rates but wary of what stimulus package may be unveiled by the new president and a Republican Congress.\n“Many” Federal Reserve officials expressed support for raising interest rates “fairly soon” if the economy stayed on course or strengthened, but the fiscal policy of the new Trump administration was a wild card, according to minutes of their meeting earlier this month released Wednesday .\nU.S. stocks SPX, -0.24% weakened after the minutes were released. But the S&P 500 hit a record high on Tuesday, and has climbed 23% over the last 52 weeks.\nOfficials struggled what to do with interest rates in light of the “considerable uncertainty” surrounding the fiscal policy plans of the Trump administration and Republican Congress.\nOnly a “couple” of the 17 Fed officials argued that uncertainty over fiscal policy should not delay a near-term rate hike.\nMost officials said it would take “some time” for the outlook on fiscal policy to become clearer.\nOther Fed officials cautioned against adjusting interest rates “in anticipation of policy proposals that might not be enacted, or that, if enacted might turn out to have different consequences for economic activity and inflation than currently anticipated,” the minutes said.\nThese issues are likely to remain when the Fed next meets on March 14-15 to set interest rate policy.\nOn Feb. 1, the Fed voted to hold interest rates steady. At the time, officials acknowledged that businesses were expressing more optimism about the outlook.\nThe minutes show that many Fed business contacts suggested that while they were more optimistic, they were awaiting more clarity about federal policy before adjusting capital spending and hiring. Some were worried their businesses could be hurt by the new administration’s plans.\nA few Fed officials noted that even the stock market reflected anticipation of expansionary tax and spending policies that “might not materialize.”\nAlso read: Yellen may have the clearest explanation for the stock market’s record run\nThrough it all, the majority of Fed officials backed gradual rate hikes. A smaller minority warned that rate hikes might have to be increased rapidly. An even smaller group wanted to go very slow.\nThere was some sense from officials that economic conditions might force the central bank to rip up its communications regarding the upcoming path of policy.\nMore from MarketWatch Who Is Trump's White House Adviser Stephen Miller?
