It was opened under an initiative undertaken by All Loktak Lake Fisherman’s Union with the support of an NGO - People Resources Development Association (PRDA). \nIt aims to provide education to dropouts, who were rendered homeless due to the recent evacuation of phumdis or floating biomass of vegetation, soil, and organic matter at various stages of decomposition. \n“As most of us are uneducated and mostly depend upon on fishing as a meagre source of income, we are unable to send our children to school to another place,” Oinam Rajen Singh, a local, said. \n“Once the programme is successful and provides quality education to students, we will expand our project and increase the classes as well. Based on India government drive on free education to all, we will increase the classes up to 8th standard so that opportunities are also given to the drop-out students,” he added. \nIt will not only cater to the needs of the children but illiterate adults will also be taught. It will accommodate around 25 students and two teachers from the community.

It is also an Important Bird Area as it is a potential breeding site for waterfowl and a staging site for migratory birds. \nIt serves as a source of water for hydropower generation, irrigation and drinking water supply. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:27.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
