By Jack Staplehurst PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 05:30, Sun, Feb 19, 2017 There is a growing belief at the Emirates that the Gunners boss is set to call time on his career in north London. However, the Frenchman does not intend to retire, having hinted he is looking to stay in management for a further four years. Arsenal are preparing to appoint a successor though, with a number of top European bosses linked. Juventus’ Max Allegri, Borussia Dortmund’s Thomas Tuchel and Monaco’s Leonardo Jardim are said to be on the club’s shortlist. GETTY Arsenal's major financial backers are split over Diego Simeone and Thierry Henry Stan Kroenke, along with influential son Josh, want Gunners legend Henry to return But according to the Mirror , there is a war at Arsenal over two other high-profile names - Thierry Henry and Diego Simeone. Major shareholder Stan Kroenke, along with influential son Josh, want Gunners legend Henry to return in a new management set-up. Arsenal’s record goalscorer, who has his coaching A license, has impressed so far as Roberto Martinez’s assistant for the Belgium national team. Henry is said to have already been sounded out about a sensational comeback. Who could succeed Arsene Wenger at Arsenal? Wed, February 15, 2017 Express Sport takes a look at top candidates who could replace Arsene Wenger at Arsenal. Odds provided by Paddy Power Leicester City FC via Getty Imag 1 of 14 Who are the favourites to replace Arsene Wenger at Arsenal? GETTY Ivan Gazidis is not keen on bringing Diego Simeone to Arsenal However, Alisher Usmanov is keen to target Atletico Madrid boss Simeone, having seen him work wonders at the La Liga club. The Argentinian has shortened his contract at the Spanish club, meaning his long-term future is set to be elsewhere. But the Kroenkes, along with Gunners chairman Sir Chips Keswick and chief executive officer Ivan Gazidis, hold sway on the big decisions. And they feel hot-headed Simeone would be too big a risk, which is set to leave Usmanov frustrated who has ambitious plans for Arsenal . GETTY Arsene Wenger could walk away from Arsenal at the end of the season when his contract expires Wenger has said his final decision is set to come in March or April , and a clean break from the club rather than a move upstairs would apparently help secure Henry’s return. The forward’s old boss blocked him from becoming Arsenal’s Under-18s coach due to his Sky Sports punditry role. And despite two offers to work with either the Under-18s or first-team strikers for free alongside his media position, Arsene Wenger rejected Henry. The 39-year-old is now on Arsenal’s managerial short-list, and could even apparently bring ex-Everton boss Martinez with him.
