For those of us who knew him and worked with him, his valiant struggle against cancer was a further inspiration.\"\nPalmer said Wetton's death came as \"quite a shock\", although he had been aware his friend's health had been \"pretty bad\" in recent weeks.\nWetton co-wrote and performed on Asia's debut hit in 1982, Heat Of The Moment Wetton recently pulled out of the supergroup's forthcoming US tour supporting rock group Journey to have chemotherapy, and he also stood down from other touring commitments before that.\nPalmer, 66, said: \"We weren't being told exactly what was going on. John wanted to keep a positive face - he wanted to try to get better, which is understandable.\"\nPalmer's Emerson, Lake & Palmer co-stars Keith Emerson and Greg Lake died last March and December respectively.\nWetton is survived by his wife Lisa and son Dylan.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/originalasia/status/826386350983225344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw", "https://www.facebook.com/CarlFPalmer/photos/a.414098718668453.97857.414036348674690/1279869262091390/?type=3&theater", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D8B7/production/_93897455_wetton2pa.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1567/production/_93897450_wettonpa.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-01T01:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:44:12.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
