The worst kind of bad thing, actually, because it could cost some of the most vulnerable children in Indiana the opportunities they both deserve and desperately need. \nThe short story is this: Weeks after the House approved a modest increase in preschool funding, funding that would help many of Indiana’s most at-risk children, a Senate committee led by Sen. Luke Kenley slashed the funding to a level so ridiculously low that it would do little to help. The move ignored the pleas of education experts, business leaders and many others — and it would continue Indiana’s tradition of shortchanging a program proven to help children prepare for kindergarten and, according to many studies, save taxpayers many times over in the long term. \nIt was a bad day at the Statehouse. And it shouldn’t be tolerated. \nThe bottom line is this: If you care about this issue, if you believe in the merits of helping low-income families gain access to high-quality preschool programs, you need to speak up. In this era of protest rallies, packed congressional town hall meetings and so much debate about federal policies, it is worth taking a look at our own backyard, at our Statehouse, and being heard on a close-to-home issue that might not be as gripping as the D.C. circus but is just as important. \nOr more so. \nWith that in mind, please email or call your state lawmakers. Believe me, such outreach from constituents helps. It influences the debate. It isn’t a guaranteed solution but it helps cut through the political gamesmanship, uninformed rhetoric, and misplaced priorities that can mar a legislative session. It’s worth a couple minutes of your time; this debate is about children who arrive at kindergarten without having had the experiences many of our own children had, and already are at risk of failing. \n(You can find you state representative and senator, as well as links to email them, at iga.in.gov/legislative/find-legislators .

As 40 other states invested in preschool, and as studies pointed to its social and academic benefits, Indiana sat on the sidelines. This cost us greatly as a state. Worse, it cost generations of children. \nFinally, in 2013, Gov. Mike Pence pushed into law a small pilot program that spends about $10 million a year and serves children in five of Indiana’s 92 counties. The former governor later made the devastating decision to squash a likely $80 federal grant. Still, the state’s preschool advisory committee has pointed to kindergarten readiness improvements since the pilot program began, as well as anecdotal stories of parents of preschool children who can now work longer hours and seek education of their own to help with job advancements. \nThis year, House Speaker Brian Bosma and Gov. Eric Holcomb, both Republicans, have advocated for a doubling in spending. That’s still too low — All in 4 Pre-K , an organization formed by business, nonprofit and education experts has called for a five-fold increase — but even the Bosma/Holcomb proposal would be a step forward. \nUntil Thursday, it appeared the legislature would spend the remainder of its session settling on a figure somewhere between the House-passed plan and the All in 4 Pre-K suggestion. But the move by Kenley’s Republican-controlled Appropriations Committee now raises the possibility of the debate being shifted downward — to between his $3 million proposal and the House’s $10 million request. \nIt also makes clear, once again, that when it comes to education many state lawmakers just don’t get it. \nIt was disappointing, for instance, to read about Kenley’s comments suggesting that preschool is simply a way to reduce parental responsibility. Now Kenley is a true giant of Indiana politics, and a thoughtful fiscal voice who has provided adult leadership in the Statehouse for years, but in this case he might need to accept the fact that the experts who have spent years studying this issue understand it better than he does. He also might think about spending some time in struggling elementary school kindergarten classrooms while also considering the immense demands on low-income families. \nComments like his are far too common at the Statehouse and make clear why all of our voices are needed. Lawmakers need to hear that preschool for 4-year-olds is not government-sponsored babysitting but rather an opportunity to expand young minds and instill classroom behaviors at a critical age. They need to hear support for proposals that would allow more students to be served in the coming years and help build up the network of high-quality preschool programs, the only kind that truly help, in both Indiana’s urban and rural areas. They need to hear that children who arrive at kindergarten unprepared to succeed often never catch up. \nPlease speak up. Please email or call your lawmakers. \nTed Maple, president of Early Learning Indiana, an Indianapolis based preschool program, emailed Thursday to say that “anything less than a significant expansion would be disappointing.” He added that advocates “remain hopeful that our elected leaders will place as big a priority on this as Hoosier families and voters clearly do.” \nThey might. But only if more of us speak up. Please do so. \nThank you for reading.
