It’s possible, after seeing the nasty claims made public by TMZ (which said the court docs were “angry”), that Sanders’ wife said he lied to the team just to cause an issue with the Broncos. It seems like it would be relatively easy to figure out if Sanders was or wasn’t there for the birth of his child. The team had no comment to the Denver Post or TMZ.\nSanders’ wife also claimed he committed adultery with numerous women and spent “thousands upon thousands of dollars on girlfriends” including buying one a car, according to TMZ. Gabriella Sanders filed for divorce last October, TMZ said.\nThe Broncos are unlikely to care what Sanders spends his money on, or even if he’s getting a divorce. But they might have a question or two for him about that practice he missed.\nEmmanuel Sanders’ wife has filed for divorce.
