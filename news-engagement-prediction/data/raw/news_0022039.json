'I watched videos online and it appealed to me because it just looked like so much fun.' Samantha, who lives with her partner retail worker Eywa Freyre, 26, said: 'It's pretty simple, really. The human body is amazing. I always get questions of \"How is it possible?\" or \"Won't your skin rip?\" She continues: 'People don't realise just how strong our skin actually is. With each suspension, the person facilitating the suspension will not only assess the person who is suspending, but also the type of suspension they want to do. High fliers: Churchwell, pictured with her brother, says the strange hobby garners interesting reactions from those who watch Rewards: Suspension is a way of getting you to trust your body, says Churchwell, who adds that people underestimate just how strong the skin is A pair of clamps, which puncture through the soft skin around the knees, help elevate the legs Suspended selfie: Creswell is seen suspending using the skin on the back of her calf muscle 'Depending on the person and the suspension, they will choose the best choice of hooks and rig to use, and then they will also go over placement choices for the piercings themselves.' But she urged a note of caution to people attempting to suspend their bodies. 'That being said, suspension is a serious thing,' she explained. 'I would go as far as saying that you are trusting someone with your life. You have to make sure you do your research and find people that are knowledgeable in the suspension world and that are going to do things correctly.' Although Samantha is now experienced in the art of body suspension, she says she does still feel pain from the piercings. The tattooed trainee mortician is seen swinging from her arms and knees while a fellow fan of suspension keeps her steady Those who partake in it admit that some people find their favourite hobby 'disgusting' She said: 'Different people who suspend always say different things, but I always say of course it hurts! 'Every suspension for me feels different, even if I'm doing it in an area that I have suspended from before, like my back, which I have suspended from the most. Sometimes it's a dull pain, sometimes it pinches, and sometimes it just sucks completely.' She tries to get through the pain by thinking about the thrill she has once she is up in the air â€“ and that is the reason she keeps going back for more. 'Once you are off the ground, flying through the air, the pain is the last thing on your mind,' she said. 'It eventually becomes dull and then fades away and that's when you know you're in the moment.' For Samantha, one of the most challenging moves is the resurrection suspension, which involves placing hooks only in her stomach and pulling her upwards. Ouch! A pair of hooks are connected to her upper abdomen. Right: Churchwell says she does it for the love of her art She said: 'I have to get out of my head in order to do it. The more I think about it, the longer it takes for me to get off the ground. You get past that initial pain, and you feel such an accomplishment. It is rewarding to say the least. You have to push yourself to just let go, to trust that your body is amazing and can handle it, and when you do, it's such a beautiful thing.' Samantha has experienced some negative reactions but is determined to carry on because of her love for the art. She said: 'I've had all types of reactions. From huge smiles and comments of 'That's amazing', to looks of disgust. I even had a former coworker say to me, 'You know you can talk to me if you feel like you need to hurt yourself.' 'While it would be great if everyone was supportive of my hobbies and what makes me happy, I understand that it just isn't practical and I am okay with that. The people that matter most to me in life and that I am close to all support me and that's all that ever really matters, right?'
