The Pats already had been stripped of their 2016 first-round pick, fined $1 million and hit with the four-game suspension of Tom Brady. \nAlso announced was the Giants’ punishment for using walkie-talkies during a December win over Dallas: New York’s fourth-round pick falls 10 spots, from 130 to 140. The Giants already were fined $150,000 and coach Ben McAdoo $50,000. \nThe good news for Patriots fans is that the team gained a fifth-round compensatory pick, No. 185 overall, plus a third-rounder from the Browns (No. 103) as part of the Jamie Collins trade. Oh, and also your team is Super Bowl champs and stuff. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:47:20.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
