Henderson, who convened a team meeting at Melwood last Thursday in response to the poor run, insists Liverpool’s performance against Mauricio Pochettino’s team indicated Klopp’s target is not as fanciful as it appears.\n“That is the aim,” the Liverpool captain said. “From day one we’ve said the aim is to win every game. Sometimes it is not possible but that’s our aim and our aim is to do that from now until the end of the season. As players we take the responsibility as we feel as though we have let ourselves down, the manager down and the fans down. Putting in that performance doesn’t make up for it but it is a start and a step in the right direction. Now we have to build on that and keep going.\n“We have fantastic quality in the team, great mentality and great character but it is no good me saying that; it is up to us to show that from now until the end of the season.”\nSadio Mané’s two early goals against Spurs set Liverpool on course for their first league win since New Year’s Eve but Henderson drew greater satisfaction from how Klopp’s team closed out the game after half-time.\nThe midfielder said: “The most pleasing thing was second half we were solid, focused, took the sting out of the game and did a lot of good things without the ball. Overall I felt we defended well as a team and attacked well as a team. They couldn’t live with Sadio’s pace in behind. We had a good week’s training leading in and I thought we put everything we had worked on in training into the game and it worked perfectly.”\nLiverpool head to La Manga on Wednesday for a five-day training camp and Henderson added: “I felt as though we’ve always had confidence and belief but performances over recent weeks haven’t been up to the standard we’ve set ourselves and we’ve been punished.\n“I thought everyone showed great character against Tottenham and now we have to make sure we are consistent and do it from now until the end of the season. In the Premier League when you win it is always an important result. To win like we did was very pleasing and it will give everyone a big lift.”\nLiverpool news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:58:06.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
