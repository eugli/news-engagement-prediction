Advertisement \n\"This government inherited a black hole when it came to the funding of the NDIS,\" Mr Morrison said. \n\"We inherited an empty promise from the previous government when it came to the NDIS. It wasn't fully funded. We have been working from day one to ensure that we fill that vacuum that was created by the previous government.\" \nThe government has already set aside about $900 million for the NDIS special account. It will build to an estimated $5 billion by 2020, when the scheme is expected to reach up to 500,000 people nationwide. \nBy then, the full spending on the scheme will be about $21 billion, with about $11 billion of that to come from the Commonwealth. Other funding will come from existing money in the disability sector and the increase in the Medicare levy. \nSocial Services Minister Christian Porter said the government was determined not to fund the scheme by borrowing more or hiking taxes further. \nLabor, which opposes the government's cuts, quickly accused the government of holding the NDIS hostage. \n\"This is a disgraceful political game of brinksmanship,\" said Labor's social services spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin. \n\"The NDIS is a bipartisan reform that should be above politics. Instead Mr Turnbull wants to use the NDIS as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Senate.\" \nGreens senator Rachel Siewert said it was \"robbing Peter to pay Paul\" and Australians were sick of such \"dirty politics\". \nMr Morrison said the decision would have no impact on the government's budget bottom line because the cost of the NDIS was already factored in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T10:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:05:10.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
