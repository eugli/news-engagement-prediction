After joining George Galloway on a convoy to Gaza, Fiddler went on the hoof to Iraq, where he hooked up with Izal and this week drove a truck packed with high explosives into an army camp, killing dozens. This was entirely predictable. As I said at the time, there was always the likelihood that some of those released from Gitmo would return to the battlefield, either at home or abroad. What if Jihad Ronnie had blown himself up in Manchester, not Mosul? Driven a Ford Transit full of Semtex into the Trafford shopping centre instead of a Iraqi army barracks? Just think of the carnage, and the backlash. Guantanamo Bay was never an ideal solution. It gave terrorism’s useful idiots and enemies of America and the West an excuse to claim the moral high ground. But after 9/11, the U.S. was desperate for intelligence to stop another attack on American soil. They had to interrogate them somewhere. Jamal Al-Harith, aka Ronald Fiddler, from Moss Side, Manchester There was always going to be the problem of what to do with the detainees eventually, especially once the ‘yuman rites’ gang started kicking off. And activists in Britain — where crooked Left-wing lawyers such as Phil Shyster could rely on lashings of legal aid — were bound to make the most mischief. We’ll never know whether the allegations of British security services being complicit in torture were true or otherwise. MI6 was hardly going to issue a signed confession. So the Government paid hush money to keep intelligence and operational details secret. Frankly, it would have been better if we’d killed every single one of these home-grown jihadists in Afghanistan. They knew the risks when they went there. Most of them, like Fiddler, used three or four Arabic aliases. None of their stories added up, yet there were plenty of fools in Britain prepared to take them at their word. We were asked to accept that after 9/11, British Muslims flew into the most dangerous war zone on earth to carry out ‘charity’ work. The notorious Tipton Taliban — a bunch of losers from the Black Country — claimed they ended up in Afghanistan, via Pakistan, where they travelled for computer studies. As if there weren’t any computer courses available at technical colleges in the West Midlands. Another said he moved to Afghanistan because he couldn’t get a job in Britain. This at a time when three million Eastern Europeans were about to move here and had no trouble finding work. Back then, for the record, the unemployment rate in Kabul was 70 per cent. The Bishop of Winchester Ephraim Hardcastle reports that following the retirement of Richard Chartres, Bishop of London, the diocese will be run until next January by ‘Call Me Pete’ Broadbent, the Guardian-reading Bishop of Willesden. Did you know Willesden had a bishop? He sounds like a character from Minder, a grown-up version of the trendy vicar who ran a social club for ex-convicts in the classic episode Give Us This Day Arthur Daley’s Bread. Arthur hires the ex-cons to build a rockery for a philanthropic lady to whom he’s just knocked out a dodgy motor. Instead they go on a burglary spree and stash the loot in the local church. I’d advise the C of E to hurry up and find a replacement for Chartres while they’ve still got some lead on the cathedral roof, and before the graveyard’s turned into a used car lot. Most ludicrous of the lot were the so-called British ‘residents’ — not even citizens. Despite being given sanctuary in this country, they still travelled to Afghanistan and the Pakistan badlands, where they were arrested in Taliban country. Yet we were expected to take them back and shower them with taxpayers’ money. Now we’re faced with hundreds of British recruits to Izal returning home, where some of them will be hell-bent on committing terror attacks on our streets. Many are already back, and the security services are struggling to keep track of them. They should have been stripped of their British nationality as soon as they were traced to Syria, and refused re-entry. We’re assured that most of them pose no clear and present danger and are unlikely to return to terrorism. Oh yeah? That’s what we were told about Jihad Ronnie. And look how he turned out. Far better to kill them on the spot in Syria and Iraq before they get the chance to come back. If that can be done by remote control without risking the life of a single British soldier, so much the better. Ignore the bleating from the usual suspects about ‘extra judicial murder’. Send in the drones. American psychiatrists have identified a new condition called Post Election Stress Disorder (PESD), comparable to the trauma suffered by troops in combat. Apparently the PESD epidemic is the result of people being unable to come to terms with Hillary Clinton’s defeat by Donald Trump, and is responsible for everything from marriage break-ups and meltdowns at work, to attempted suicide and car crashes. Presumably the same applies to those who refuse to accept the result of the Brexit referendum and are, as psychiatrists say, ‘in denial’. I told you the behaviour of resentful Remainers borders on mental illness. Just look at the petulant tears and temper tantrums of everyone from Anna Soubry to Nick Clegg. Some of them belong in a straitjacket. Now it’s official. The sooner we can have them diagnosed with PESD, the sooner we can have them all sectioned. This column doesn’t do honeymoon periods, but the new Met police commissioner Cressida Dick has to be an improvement on the outgoing Bernard Hyphen-Howe. I’ve never held the tragic death of Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes against her, even though she was in charge of the operation which led to him being shot. Police Commander Cressida Dick leaving the Old Bailey London was jumpy after the July 7 Tube and bus bombings. More attacks were planned and the police were under unimaginable pressure to stop them. De Menezes was in the wrong place at the wrong time and became another innocent casualty of the war on London being waged by Islamist terrorists. The first female commissioner has an impressive track record and is reported to be popular with the troops — which is more than can be said for Hyphen-Howe, who played favourites and drove talented senior officers to retire early. What worries me is her defence of the outrageous, heavy-handed dawn raids on innocent journalists, guilty of nothing more than doing their jobs, during the deranged anti-Press witch-hunt which followed the phone-hacking scandal. The police have to be accountable, not just to their political masters but also to the paying public, who get their information from the media. Criminalising contacts between coppers and crime reporters creates a sinister culture of secrecy. Still, she will be judged on her actions. My biggest problem — as the columnist who brought you Captain Beaujolais and Hyphen-Howe — will be coming up with a better nickname for the new commissioner than Cressida Dick. At the Brit Awards, an American singer called Katy Perry cavorted around the Albert Hall with a couple of skeletons, said to represent Donald Trump and Theresa May. Given the tone of the rest of the evening, which at times resembled a glorified memorial service, can we be certain this wasn’t just another tribute to David Bowie and George Michael?
