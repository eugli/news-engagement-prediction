North Korea test-fired a new ballistic missile on Sunday, the first since US President Donald Trump took office in late January. The launch was condemned by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as \"absolutely intolerable\" during a press conference with Trump, and prompted responses from South Korea, China and Russia.

Even we will try to go faster.\" Trump hasn't made it clear what his policy on North Korea will be. He said in a press conference Thursday, \"We'll take care of it folks; we're going to take care of it all.\" Experts on North Korea said analysis suggested the sanctions are having an effect. \"They're working and they have slowed the nuclear program, they have slowed the ballistic missile program,\" said senior analyst Joseph Bermudez of North Korea monitoring group 38 North. \"If (sanctions) hadn't been in place, we would have seen both programs at a more advanced stage than they are today.\" Missile launch a 'gift' to honor Kim Jong Il Economic development Ri said restrictions on the North's ability to sell raw materials, including coal, hadn't impeded the country's economic growth.

Koreans praise missile test despite sanctions 03:00 \"The basic principle in terms of exporting raw materials from DPRK is simply we don't promote the export of raw materials including coal,\" he said. \"As a result of that particular principle... we don't feel very much affected by the so-called restrictions in the export of coal.\" He said the country is earning money from tech exports to Southeast Asia -- including precision computer numerical control (CNC) systems -- and processed raw materials like magnesite, graphite, and zinc products. How US could stop a North Korean missile Still at odds with US In his interview with CNN, Ri issued a thinly veiled warning to the United States and its regional allies seeking to crack down on North Korea. \"They have to take... into good consideration, the fact that the DPRK has now become a full-fledged nuclear power, a military power in the East.\" Asked about the new Trump administration, Ri said while the United States maintains a \"continuous hostile policy,\" it doesn't matter which President is in the White House.
