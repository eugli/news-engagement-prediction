According to Johnson Asiedu Nketia, the state of Ghana’s economy is no news since when in opposition, the New Patriotic Party (NPP) even painted a gloomy picture thus cannot be a basis to “run away from the promises”. General Mosquito as he is popularly called made the comment after President Akufo-Addo bemoaned the state of the economy he inherited from the erstwhile Mahama-led administration. Delivering his first State of the Nation Address Tuesday, the President said his government has only 0.4 percent of public revenue to finance a slew of campaign promises and programmes. President Akufo-Addo stated that the 99.6 percent of revenue, he said, is spent on only three items - wages, statutory payments and a greater concern - interest payments on loans that has left government with a GH¢122bn debt. But speaking in an interview, Mr. Asiedu Nketia said the President should not use the state of the economy argument as an excuse for not delivering on his plethora of promises. He indicated that, whether the state of the economy is good or bad, President Akufo-Addo must deliver to the citizenry who voted for him in the 201 elections. “You cannot lie your way to power and come to take the people for granted” General Mosquito said in an interview on Joy News Tuesday. In his view, there was nothing new in the State of the Nation Address by the President since it was the very things he was echoing while in opposition. General Mosquito said the NDC will be a responsible opposition and put the President on his toes to deliver all his promises.
