Especially since his reserve price was only $A38,900, which by IPL standards is fairly low. \nBut on the day of the auction something went horribly wrong and it had nothing to do with him. A case of mistaken identity cost Harpreet Singh dearly at the IPL auction.

That’s some achievement for a man who was nine and a half hours away by car in Indore at the time. \nAs it turned out, the man who had driven onto the platform was Harmeet Singh, another first-class cricketer in India who was coincidentally a teammate of Harpreet in India’s Under 19s team at the 2010 World Cup. \nEventually, the media outlets who had erred corrected their mistake but by that time it was too late for Harpreet, with the Indian Express claiming that the misleading reports had cost Harpreet a bid at the auction. \n“We wanted to buy him, but as news came of Harpreet’s arrest, we decided not to do so since it would give the franchise a bad image. But later, when the auction got over, we came to know it was Harmeet and not Harpreet,” the Express quoted an unnamed franchise official as saying. \n“All is not lost for him. If someone gets injured, we’ll pick Harpreet as first choice.” It was actually Harmeet Singh (front and centre) who drove onto the railway station platform.

It was all over the media, and all this happened with the IPL auctions unfolding. \n“I was the highest run-getter of the tournament, and now the performances that got me into the players’ pool, have been forgotten. I would still be okay with not being picked for the IPL, but the disrepute that the poor reporting has got me, is something beyond repair,” he said.
