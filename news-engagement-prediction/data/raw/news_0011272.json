The crisis of funding may finally have propelled the issue on to the political agenda, but the term itself is still oddly obscure. To those who need it, social care essentially means a lifeline: a care worker to help you shower in the morning or cook a hot meal at night.\nNationally, while it’s mainly older people who rely on the system, disabled people represent a third of all social care users . That equates to around 400,000 working-age disabled people in England alone. But listen to ministers such as David Mowat MP argue that family members need to take responsibility for looking after elderly relatives, or read much of the recent media coverage, and it would be easy to think that disabled people were either token recipients or part of a different system altogether.\nThe word “disabled” is rarely used in news coverage, and the accompanying stock images routinely depict frailty and grey hair. Meanwhile, politicians who now regularly refer to “the elderly” surviving on 15-minute care slots are largely silent when it comes to disabled people or those with chronic illnesses.\nIn the House of Commons, Theresa May pledged to ensure people would receive the care they needed in old age – forgetting those with disabilities who rely on the service for decades of their lives. While older people are seen by politicians as reliable voters to be courted, disabled people hold such insignificance they do not even warrant a mention.\nFor a real insight into Britain’s social care crisis, consider the words of one local councillor in Surrey – where a referendum was planning to raise council tax by 15% to pay for social care, until a deal was made with the government. Mel Few, a council cabinet member for adult social care, told the Guardian that despite older people getting much of the attention, it’s the needs of disabled residents that “[keep] me awake at night”. Of its £570m adult social care budget, Surrey projects that this year it will spend more on people with learning or physical disabilities than for older people (53% compared with 41%).\nTake care of your elderly mothers and fathers, says Tory minister Read more \nYet in most discussions on social care, disabled people are largely reduced to euphemisms. Terms such as “vulnerable” adults – abstract, vague – are useful for avoiding responsibilities. Here, there is no concrete detail of disability or tangible lives to think about. Yet it isn’t simply the generality of the word being employed that’s telling, but the specific term itself.\n“Vulnerable” is a tried-and-tested way of shifting the burden from the state to the individual. When politicians talk of disabled people as being vulnerable, it perpetuates the false belief that vulnerability is an inevitable consequence of disability rather than the direct result of government choices. The truth is, it is not being unable to walk that makes a quadriplegic vulnerable. It is slashing their social care budget so there is no personal assistant to help them get dressed.\n“Vulnerability” is spreading. As things stand, more than a million disabled people are living without social care , according to the charity Leonard Cheshire Disability. After six years of cuts to local authority budgets, almost half the disabled people who say they need support aren’t receiving any at all, while those already in the system have watched their care packages be gutted.\nThere are now widespread reports of disabled people becoming physically sicker because they have no help to move or wash themselves; or sliding into depression when, with no care worker to help them get out of the house, they are forced to spend day and night within four walls.\nAfter six years of cuts to local authority budgets, almost half the disabled people who need support aren’t getting any\n\nI’ve spoken to disabled people in their 20s who are regularly forced into bed at 6pm or 7pm because it’s the only care slot available. Others report having to use incontinence pads, not because they are incontinent but because there is no one to help them get to the toilet.\nThis sounds horrific, but it did not come from nowhere. Rather, what is happening in the social care system is emblematic of a wider assault on disabled people’s right to live independently. Nearly £28bn has been pulled from social security for disabled people since 2013 , and the independent living fund which helped 18,000 severely disabled people live in their own homes, has been axed. In addition, benefit cuts have resulted in wheelchairs and adapted cars being taken away from disabled people’s homes and driveways. There have also been reports recently that 37 NHS clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) in England are introducing rules that could force up to 13,000 disabled people into residential care against their will – this is not dystopian hyperbole but a warning of where we are heading.\nThat politicians can engage in a conversation about social care largely without referring to disability is an explicit reminder of how, for certain people, the most basic rights and needs can be simultaneously characterised as expendable and simply forgotten. This mindset is a product of a culture that still does not equate disability with a normal adult existence – the chance to work, find a home, meet a partner, have children – and a government that is content to perpetuate that myth. That we are in an era of “scrounger” rhetoric and austerity policies only encourages this. While older people are largely seen as a group that should be protected, disabled people are widely perceived as a costly burden on the state.\nThis is not the time to be silent about disability or to fall back into the comfort of euphemisms. If we continue to exclude disabled people from the vision of social care in this country, it will simply, quietly, be pulled further away. If there is one thing that will make disabled people vulnerable, it’s failing to put words to what’s being done to them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T09:40:28.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
