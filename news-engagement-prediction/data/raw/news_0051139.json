(PTI) \nSamajwadi Party leader Amar Singh today claimed that the political turmoil in the party was a “programmed drama”. He also said that SP patron Mulayam Singh and his son and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh “are one and will remain one”. “It was a programmed drama in which all of us were given a role. I subsequently realised that we are being used… I came to realise it was a ploy to distract from the anti- incumbency, law and order situation,” he said. \nYou May Also Like To Watch This: \n“Mulayam loves being defeated at the hands of his son.
