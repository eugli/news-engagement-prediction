Sean Spicer explains why President Trump tweeted about Nordstrom but not Quebec City Ivanka Trump lines pulled from stores \nThe question came in an earnings call that accompanied the release of the retailer’s fourth-quarter earnings . \nIt also came after Trump slagged the company on Twitter for treating his daughter Ivanka “unfairly” after it pulled her products because sales didn’t meet expectations . My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom . She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 \nIn the call, analyst Omar Saeed asked Nordstrom executives whether they saw “any trend in your business at all around the president’s tweets, whether it’s helped you or hurt you at all?,” according to a transcript posted by Seeking Alpha . \n“No, that would be negligible,” Peter Nordstrom answered, before the call moved on to other matters. \nREAD MORE: Donald Trump Twitter criticism of Nordstrom raises conflict of interest concern \nTrump’s tweet might not have had any discernible impact on Nordstrom’s business, but it did raise concerns among ethics experts — one of whom worried that other brands might now decide against dropping Ivanka’s products because of fear of being criticized by the president. \n“The implicit threat was that he will use whatever authority he has to retaliate against Nordstrom, or anyone who crosses his interest,” Kathleen Clark, a Washington University law professor, told The Associated Press earlier this month. \nMeanwhile, Trump aide Kellyanne Conway was accused of breaking ethics rules when she encouraged people to buy Ivanka’s products. \nKellyanne Conway, senior adviser to President Trump, watches the swearing in ceremony of Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Thursday, Feb. 9, 2017.
