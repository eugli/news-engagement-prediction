TVNZ \nWhangapoua bach is one out of the box. \nAnd this house is also by Crosson Architects, so we're not too surprised to see it that it peels open like an orange. But this bach has another tricky feature – it sits on two gigantic oak beams that can be pulled by a tractor, so it is essentially a hut on sleds. If the coast erodes or the sea rises, the house can be moved. \nREAD MORE \nAt the touch of a button, the front wall folds up to create an overhang. \nClarke cleverly calls it a classic example of \"blue-sky thinking\". \nThe interior is even more inspiring. Lined in timber, with floor-to-ceiling bookcases stretching right up the double-height void, the hut is guaranteed to keep you amused even when it rains. \nClarke says, \"A lot of work has gone into this to make it look simple, but my word, it's worth it.\" And who could fail to be charmed by the half-ton wall that folds up like a piece of origami, and the trap-door onto the roof terrace, which makes Clarke feels like a lifeguard on the watchtower. SIMON DEVITT \nShutters can also be opened, creating awnings above the windows at the side of the house. \nWe also get to see the next stage of the presenter's own project – a rotating house with a different \"room\" on each wall. Now they have mastered the art of the rotation, all that remains is to see how they deal with the furniture, not to mention the food and drink. \nIt's all suitably mad, but oddly compelling. \nAmazing Spaces screens on TVNZ 1 on Thursdays at 7.30pm. SIMON DEVITT \nWhile the bach is currently anchored in place, it could be moved by tractor. - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:31:51.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
