In addition to showcasing the actors' charm, it delves into the back story of the end tag scene that showed the two together. \n\"Late into the shooting of Strange , the Thor: Ragnarok script was coming together, and as we were reading it, we said, this scene could be hilarious. Wouldn't it be funny and answer the question right away, what's it going be like when Doctor Strange enters the Marvel Universe,\" executive producer Stephen Broussard says in the video. \nThe scene in question made its way into Doctor Strange , showing the sorcerer providing Thor with an endless glass of beer, and thus surely making him the God of Thunder's new favorite superhero. \nThere will be more of them together in Thor: Ragnarok , which hits theaters Nov. 3. God of Thunder meets Sorcerer Supreme.
