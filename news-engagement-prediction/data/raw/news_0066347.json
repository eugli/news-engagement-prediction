Moskowitz has shut dozens of her schools for the rallies, busing thousands of children to Albany to rally for charter causes, and has asked parents to take the day off from work to attend the events. One rally, in March 2014, cost the network at least $734,000, according to a POLITICO New York analysis. She has deep ties to local lawmakers and helped influence the passage of a sweeping pro-charter bill through the New York State Legislature in 2013. \nMoskowitz has testified in favor of charter schools during congressional hearings and is a regular attendee at Sun Valley, an annual private conference of the world’s top CEOs and financiers. A former city councilwoman, she has long considered running for mayor. \nShe was also on Trump’s short list of Education secretary candidates, and met with him in the days after the election. \nHer considerable political clout and connections seem to have left her staff with the impression she would take a stand on Trump policies that directly impact Success’ 14,000 students, particularly the recent immigration ban. The vast majority of Success students are black or Latino, many are immigrants, and some are undocumented. \n“We, as a school system, need you to stand up for all of us and decry these actions on our behalf,” the faculty letter reads. \nMoskowitz replied that she found that request unreasonable. “What proportion of our community has to agree with a particular position for me to purport to ‘speak for us?,'\" she asked in the letter, “90%? 80%? 51%?” \nMoskowitz has refused on several occasions to answer questions about protections for undocumented students in her schools. She ignored repeated questions about how Success would handle the threat of student deportations at a press conference in November when she announced she would not serve as Education secretary, and again declined to comment in a New Yorker article several days later. City schools chancellor Carmen Fariña has sent guidance home to families reiterating that the Department of Education will not release information about students’ immigration status to federal immigration officers. \n“My position as a public figure and national education leader limits the expression of my personal views,” Moskowitz said in the letter. \nBut Moskowitz has been one of the charter sector’s most prominent supporters of DeVos, a billionaire proponent of school choice now heading the U.S. Department of Education, despite considerable backlash to her nomination. \nMoskowitz released several statements to the press defending DeVos and encouraging the Senate to confirm her nomination. She also appeared on CNN during the confirmation fight to accuse DeVos’ opponents of using “scare tactics” to block her nomination. \nIn the letter to her staff, Moskowitz again praised DeVos. \n“I have known her for a decade, and I believe that she is smart and has the best interests of children at heart,” she wrote. \nMoskowitz pointed out that “widely respected” Democrat Joe Lieberman has supported DeVos, and said, “sometimes it’s helpful to have an outsider come in and shake thing up.” But, Moskowitz said, “that doesn’t mean I share all of Secretary DeVos’ views.” \nOn Wednesday, Moskowitz tweeted criticism of the Trump administration’s decision to roll back federal guidelines protecting the rights of transgender students. Moskowitz linked to a New York Times article reporting that DeVos sought to keep the protections in place, but was ultimately overruled by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. \nSuccess Academy has received $300,000 from DeVos’ education foundation. \nSuccess faculty also asked Moskowitz why she has publicly defended Trump, considering she has repeatedly said she voted for Hillary Clinton. In November, Moskowitz said she was “troubled by what I see as a sort of rooting for Trump's failure.\" In a television appearance that month, she highlighted one of Trump’s favorite talking points: his electoral college victory. “Trump [won] very big,” she said on NY1. \nPrompted by her faculty to explain her stance about Trump, Moskowitz wrote, “I believe education is a bipartisan issue, and I intend to support those educational policies of President Trump with which I agree.” \nMoskowitz’s support for DeVos and perspective on Trump sets her apart from many of her would-be allies in the national education reform world. \nShavar Jeffries, a member of Success’s board of directors and the director of Democrats for Education Reform, urged the Senate to vote against DeVos’ nomination. Prominent charter leaders, including KIPP founder Dave Levin, have denounced Trump’s immigration ban on Twitter. \nSpokespeople for Success Academy did not reply to requests for additional comment on Moskowitz’s letter and tensions between Moskowitz and staff over Trump.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:29:38.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
