So, I don't know why we would bother building a busway first, which would then need to be disrupted during construction to be transformed into rail,\" Genter said \nWhile Genter admitted a busway would initially be cheaper, she said: \"Over the long-term life of the project, it will cost us less and benefit us more to do rail first.\" \nGenter, however, stressed that the mayor's position on rail to Auckland's North Shore had been forced on him by the National Government's lack of transport funding. Ad Feedback \n\"I think that the mayor is in a difficult situation because the National Government is refusing to allow Auckland to raise revenue to invest in long-term infrastructure through a regional fuel tax, and that's what needs to happen,\" Genter said. \n\"It's really not the mayor's fault, it's our National Government who's holding Auckland back from investing in the long-term infrastructure that we need and want.\" \nBut despite Goff's confidence that a busway in the Additional Waitemata Harbour Crossing could be easily converted to a light rail line, TransportBlog spokesperson Matt Laurie has his doubts. \n\"From my point of view, you would either build the crossing with light rail, or you go with buses the whole way,\" Laurie said. \n\"I've never heard of a tunnel that you'd convert from being a busway into a light rail in the future. You'd need to design it with the various safety standards in place for whatever method it's going to be. \n\"One of the advantages of a rail-based system is that it's stuck on rails and it's not going to move off a set margin, whereas in a bus the driver is going to veer around a bit and he needs a bit more space in the road corridor.\" \nA poll from Generation Zero in 2016 found that 64 per cent of Aucklanders wanted a rail and road AWHC. Only 22 per cent of people wanted a road only crossing. \nHowever, the Auckland Transport Alignment Plan, released in September 2016, indicated the AWHC may not be built and open to commuters until 2048 - a blow out in NZTA's initial time estimate of 2030. \nMayor Goff talked to Stuff about transport and other issues in a Facebook Live Chat on February 16. \n- Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T03:09:31.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
