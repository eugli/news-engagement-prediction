Umezushi , meanwhile, flies the flag for the city centre and offers an 'unrivalled spectrum of Japanese cooking', according to the newspaper. \nFurther afield, Michelin-starred Northcote , described as having an 'international, big-city feel without ever forgetting it’s in rural Lancashire', and the Freemasons at Wiswell which produces food with 'finesse and confidence', also made the list. \nNearby, Cumbria also has three restaurants in the top 100: L'Enclume by Simon Rogan who judges say is able to turn 'the humblest ingredients into gastronomic gold'; Gilpin in Windermere , which serves British Asian cuisine with dishes that 'look like works of art'; and The Lake Road Kitchen in Ambleside, with memorable dishes such as 199-day aged beef .
