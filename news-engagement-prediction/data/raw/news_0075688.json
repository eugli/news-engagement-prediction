(Yvonne Wenger) \nDedric was shot once in his shoulder and once in his calf. An eighth-grader at City Springs Middle School at the time, he was awake and alert in the hospital by the next morning, though in pain. \nBaltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis defended the officers, saying police can't afford to hesitate and discover if a gun is real. The department held a press conference and displayed side-by-side a Beretta semiautomatic pistol and identical-looking BB gun. Davis said one witnesses reported that Dedric was still holding the toy gun when he stopped and turned toward officers. The witness, Davis said, described the boy as raising the toy gun.

(Courtesy Rickey Gibbs Jr.) See more videos \nThe shooting emerged as a flashpoint in the debate over imitation toy guns in a city plagued by violence. Citing Dedric's case, the Baltimore City Council in December banned toy guns that resemble working handguns and rifles. Gun-rights advocates opposed the bill, which set fines of $250 for those carrying look-alike guns. \nThe shooting also recalled the death of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was shot by a police officer in November 2014 after he brandished a toy gun in a public park. The City of Cleveland agreed to pay $6 million to settle a federal lawsuit brought by Rice's family. \nPolice identified the officer who shot Dedric as Thomas Smith, a 12-year veteran. Smith and another officer, a six-year veteran who was not named, were leaving police headquarters when they saw the boy walking with the BB gun. Dedric's mother, Volanda Young, found her son shot in the street. \n\"Upon Ms. Young's arrival, officers shouted at her and told her to 'back the f--- up' while pointing tasers at her,\" Dedric's attorneys wrote. \"The officers then arrested Ms. Young, took her to a police station, put her in a cell and detained her.\" \nDavis has said Young was acting belligerent, and his officers made a judgment call during a tense situation. Neither the mother nor her son will be charged, Davis has said. \nAttorneys for the family want the names and badge numbers of officers who detained Young and any others involved in the shooting of Dedric. The attorneys from Murphy, Falcon & Murphy had previously won a $6.4 million settlement for the family of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old man who died April 2015 of spinal injuries suffered in police custody. \nThe attorneys wrote that they've requested records of Dedric's shooting, but have been refused by police amid the ongoing investigation. Now they're asking the court for authority to depose police for the names and numbers. \nThe investigation into the shooting remains unresolved by the Baltimore state's attorney's office. Police routinely withhold such evidence and records until investigations conclude. But the attorneys risk surpassing the statute of limitations if they continue to wait, they told the court. \nOn Sunday, police said they await the determination from the state's attorney's office. They declined to comment further.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:29:03.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
