I’ve been struggling for two weeks over what to call you, and your tweet here gave us the answer.” Thank you, So-Called President Trump! I've been struggling for 2 weeks over what to call you, and your tweet here gave us the answer. https://t.co/HVf3oSWYum —Michael Moore (@MMFlint) February 5, 2017 \nLots of other people had the very same idea and flooded #SoCalledPresident with snarky tweets. \"So-called judge\" comment by \"so-called President\"Next - — Stephen Moon (@StephenMSiS) February 4, 2017 I think our #SoCalledPresident could use a civics refresher. Here you go, @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/tdcPR9swZ5 — Rogue Stefanek (@RobertStefanek) February 4, 2017 #SoCalledPresident is on a $3 million taxpayer funded vacation after 2 weeks of signing bogus EO's and leading a botched military fiasco. — Sean Corcoran (@seacorc) February 4, 2017 \nTrump’s insulting language against Robart rattled legal experts who saw the attack as undermining an independent judiciary and sabotaging a regard for the law and legal authority. It raised a fear of a constitutional crisis should the president — or a federal agency — choose to ignore a court order. Vice President Mike Pence defended Trump Sunday, saying he was simply “expressing frustration” at Robart’s order. “I don’t think he was questioning the legitimacy of the judge ,” Pence told “Face the Nation” on CBS. The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2017 \nIf it’s any consolation to Robart, Trump’s tweet places him in a large “so-called” family of Trump targets. A survey by the A.V. Club discovered that Trump has also referred to a “ so-called carbon footprint ,” the “so-called Commission on Presidential Debates,” the “so-called popular vote,” “so-called leaders,” the “so-called Obama years,” “so-called A-list celebrities,” and, of course, “so-called journalists.” The so-called \"A\" list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016 Russia took Crimea during the so-called Obama years. Who wouldn't know this and why does Obama get a free pass? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 14, 2016 There must be a higher standard of accuracy in the media. Incredible that some so-called \"journalists\" can make up lies and get away with it — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 4, 2014 \n“So-called presidents” were mentioned Sunday by Nebraska Republican Senator Ben Sasse, who seemed a bit stunned by the language Trump used to refer to Robart. \n“I’ll be honest, I don’t understand language like that,” Sasse said on ABC’s “This Week.” “ We don’t have so-called judges . We don’t have so-called senators. We don’t have so-called presidents.” \nHe added: “We have people from three different branches of government who take an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution, and it’s important that we do better civics education for our kids. So we don’t have any so-called judges. We have real judges.” Sen. Ben Sasse on Pres. Trump's attack on federal judge: \"We don't have 'so-called' judges\" https://t.co/rp1M0fQ7mA #ThisWeek pic.twitter.com/ao04zEcdjE — ABC News (@ABC) February 5, 2017 Related Coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:54:43.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
