By Cathal Dennehy Saturday, February 11, 2017, 8:31 pm Ajee’ Wilson runs the 800 meters at the Millrose Games en route to an American record. Kevin Morris/PhotoRun\\ \nShortly before their 800-meter clash at the 110th edition of the Millrose Games, training partners and close friends Ajee’ Wilson and Charlene Lipsey shared a few words.

Fellow training partner Kimarra McDonald took them through 400 meters in a swift 57.15, and when she stepped aside, it was left to Wilson to then keep up the pace. \n“I was just trying to keep the momentum going,” Wilson said. “We were gunning for 1:58.” \nWilson clocked 1:58.27 to smash the American indoor record, 1:58.71, held by Nicole Teter since 2002. \nThe 22-year-old Wilson was not getting carried away with her achievement. “It’s nice to get my name in the record books, but I don’t run for time,” she said. “To have a goal and do something my coach told me I could is great.” \nThough Lipsey mounted a strong challenge on the final lap, she had no answers to Wilson’s final surge and had to settle for second in 1:58.64, something she was happy to do. \n“I was just trying to run two minutes,” Lipsey said. “It definitely surprised me. I’m not disappointed at all. I’ll take a time over place any day.” \nSamantha Watson broke Mary Decker’s 43-year-old American high school record by 0.02 seconds. Watson ran 2:01.78 to finish sixth. \nWanamaker miles: Hassan and Jenkins power home \nAt the halfway mark in the women’s Wanamaker mile, the race seemed poised for a repeat performance from last year’s champion, Shannon Rowbury . Lurking in the American’s slipstream, however, was Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, who recently moved to Portland and the Oregon Project to train with Rowbury. \nWhen the pacemaker dropped out with three laps to run, Kate Grace was left at the front, with Rowbury and Hassan stalking behind. It was then that Hassan surged to the lead, dropping a 32-second lap, followed by a 31-second lap, which moved her clear of the field. \nThe Dutch athlete then reeled off a 30-second lap to power through the finish in 4:19.89, the fourth-fastest indoor mile in history. \n“It was a beautiful time, especially for this early in the year,” Hassan said. “I planned to go at 800 meters but the pace was pretty quick so I decided to wait.” \nHassan said that her training has escalated since she joined forces with Alberto Salazar, who coaches the Oregon Project. “They work very hard,” she said. “It’s different to what I was used to do. It used to be two or three hard workouts a week, but now it’s five times.” \nGrace won the battle for second, edging Rowbury 4:22.93 to 4:23.05. \nOn what was a great night for Salazar, another of his athletes finished the meet with a win in the men’s Wanamaker Mile. Eric Jenkins unleashed a furious kick to take the title in 3:53.23. \nThe race reached halfway in a steady 1:57.98, with Jenkins leading the pack behind pacemaker Daniel Winn. With one lap to run, Jenkins surrendered the lead to local favorite Kyle Merber, who heard a deafening roar as he led into the back stretch. \nJenkins, however, had plenty in reserve, and he surged clear once again as they entered the final turn. A fast finish by Clayton Murphy earned him the runner-up spot in 3:54.31, with Merber taking third in 3:54.67. \n“I didn’t want it to come down to a kick because so many guys had fast finishes, so I strung it out early,” Jenkins said. “This year my training has been really good. Alberto said to me before that I need to be in the front. I couldn’t afford to give these guys space, so that’s what I did.” \nMen’s two-mile: True the champion in a close race \nAlthough before the meet there had been talk that Galen Rupp’s American record— 8:07.41—would fall, the time was never in jeopardy. But nothing could rival this contest for down-to-the-wire drama. \nThe pack reached halfway in 4:08.85, too slow to threaten Rupp’s mark. And at that point it seemed that Matt Centrowitz , gold medalist in the 1500 meters at the 2016 Olympics in Rio, would have too much speed for this field. \nHe was running a distance far beyond his comfort zone, however, which became clear with two laps to run as Centrowitz drifted out of contention. At the bell, Ben True led Ryan Hill of the Bowerman Track Club, but Hill surged to the front entering the final turn in what looked to be a decisive move. \nTrue, though, surged back to the lead just meters from the finish, edging Hill 8:11.33 to 8:11.56. Centrowitz finished a distant seventh in 8:21.07. \n“This is something special,” True said. “It was my first time on this track and the banks felt pretty weird. Passing people was very difficult, and I tripped myself up several times. It’s nice to be able to actually run as well as I did and get a good result.” \nWomen’s 3,000 meters: Van Buskirk leaves it late \nEarlier in the day, Canada’s Kate Van Buskirk had written a little memo to herself on the inside of both wrists. On the left: Don’t worry. On the right: Be happy. \nThroughout the 15-lap race, she heeded that advice, running well off the quick tempo laid down by pacemaker Ashley Higginson, who towed the field through 1,000 meters in 2:54.93 and 2,000 meters in 5:55.62. It was then that race favorite Stephanie Garcia surged to the front, but as she soon realized, that can be a lonely place with five laps still to run. \nOver the next two laps, Van Buskirk slowly shifted through the gears to close the 25-meter deficit to Garcia, then sat, waiting patiently, for her time to strike. Only off the last bend did she blast by to take a decisive win in 8:52.08, carving more than 20 seconds off her previous best. Garcia held on for second in 8:53.48, with Tori Gerlach third in 8:54.61.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T11:03:02.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
