Photo: Joe Raedle/Getty Images It’s official: America’s top diplomat is now Vladimir Putin’s favorite Exxon CEO .\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Senate voted to let Rex Tillerson run the State Department by margin of 56 to 43 — the stiffest opposition any secretary of State has faced at confirmation in half a century.\nOne month ago, John McCain suggested that he would vote for Tillerson when “ pigs fly .” So, you might want to check the sky for airborne hogs this evening — the Arizona maverick joined every other Republican senator in backing Trump’s nominee.\nTillerson also garnered the support of Democrats Mark Warner, Heidi Heitkamp, and Joe Manchin, along with left-leaning independent Angus King.\nWhile lacking any experience in government, Tillerson did serve for many years as, in essence, a top foreign minister of the ExxonMobil empire. In that role, he brokered deals with foreign governments — often repressive ones — to secure his company’s access to oil and gas. Among Tillerson’s most ambitious deals was an agreement he struck with Vladmir Putin that allowed Exxon to extract Russia’s reserves of Arctic oil (which, thanks to climate change, are a lot more accessible than they used to be !). That whole project got iced by America’s sanctions on Russia, following the latter’s invasion of Crimea. But now, Tillerson is in a position to thaw that rift.\nStill, the former Exxon CEO’s new gig isn’t all fun and profit. Handling diplomacy for the least diplomatic man ever elected president won’t be easy. Over the past few weeks, Trump has soured relations with America’s southern neighbor , its chief geopolitical frenemy , the most powerful nation in Europe , and most of the Muslim world .\nTags: rex tillerson trump cabinet secretary of state senate confirmation Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Senate Confirms Rex Tillerson As Secretary of State British Parliament Votes in Favor of Bill to Trigger Brexit Democrats Need to Flip One More Republican to Block Betsy DeVos Most Viewed Stories White House Considers Deporting Legal Immigrants for Being Poor What’s New on Netflix: February 2017 Make Republicans Nuke the Filibuster to Confirm Neil Gorsuch The White House Cuts Off CNN The Real Reason You’ll Never Be Able to Parent Like a French Mom Imagining the White House’s Black History Month Schedule This Poll Is the Best News Liberals Have Had in a Long Time Report: Melania Trump Might Not Move to Washington at All Orangutans Are Now Looking for Mates on ‘Tinder’ There Was One Explicit Sex Scene in Girls That Even HBO Wouldn’t Allow Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer Chait: Obama's Legacy Will Endure Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 4:55 p.m. Senate Confirms Rex Tillerson As Secretary of State It’s official: America’s top diplomat is now Vladimir Putin’s favorite Exxon CEO!\n4:49 p.m. British Parliament Votes in Favor of Bill to Trigger Brexit Prime Minister Theresa May is one step closer to meeting her March 2017 deadline.\n2:55 p.m. Democrats Need to Flip One More Republican to Block Betsy DeVos One vote away from keeping the billionaire heiress to the Amway fortune from becoming Education Secretary.\n2:21 p.m. The Army Corps Moves to Finish Dakota Access Pipeline Construction A week after Trump signed his executive order calling for its construction to be completed.\n1:37 p.m. The Democrats Need to Try Out Being the ‘Party of No’ Starting with President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.\n1:29 p.m. Gorsuch Could Give WASPs Representation on SCOTUS Again Trump’s nominee would be the 34th Episcopalian to serve on the Court.
