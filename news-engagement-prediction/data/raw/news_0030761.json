Photography by Ahmad Iskandar Photography By Time Out Singapore editors Posted: Friday November 4 2016 1/7 CreatureS \nDennis and Kok Cheong Chong have done quite well for themselves with their first venture, CreatureS. Born from the pair’s love for hosting house parties and private dinners, the cyan-walled joint on Desker Road is pretty much an extension of their home: it’s stocked with fresh bouquets, eclectic alternative music, immaculate furniture and good food. Kok Cheong, responsible for the diverse menu (Dennis is the restaurant director), isn’t formally trained. Instead, he relies on intuition and his memories of growing up in a Peranakan household. ‘Guys were not allowed in the kitchen, so I only remember how the dishes taste,’ he adds. Cooking from recollection also shows through in a few travel-inspired options on the menu. The Chongs liken Mod-Sin cuisine to a language that can bridge different cultures. They believe that infusing Singaporean flavours into foreign recipes, or vice versa, demonstrates the versatility of local cuisine – it should be more expansive and not only about hawker food, they say. Because for CreatureS, Mod-Sin is about presenting a contemporary take on the exhaustive tastes and aromas of the Singapore everyday. ORDER THIS Ah Gong Fried Chicken and Ah Ma Noodles ($23) – perfect for when you want something extra gratifying, diet be damned. Inspired to make his own version of fried chicken after returning from Taiwan, Kok Cheong took the liberty of adding garam masala and a side of chinchalok (a paste made from fermented krill) mayonnaise. The dish comes with a serving of la mian in an aromatic mix of light soya sauce and shallots.
