They went through my bag and tore up all the remaining stickers. They wouldn’t tell me who was in charge. It became clear that they weren’t going to arrest me; they were just there to intimidate me. That’s when one of them slapped me with his open hand, knocking my glasses off,” says Hunter. \nIn a bid to defuse the situation, Hunter says, he admitted to the officers that his actions were wrong, but they continued to shout at him. \n“I told them that this was assault and that they couldn’t do this. That’s when the officer hit me again.” \nThe officers forced him to remove the sticker from the police car before they sped off. \n“I wasn’t able to get a licence plate number. With the reputation of the police protection unit, I think I got off pretty lightly. I stand by my act, because it was a political statement. Whether they should’ve arrested me for it is a whole other conversation, but they didn’t.” \nHunter opened a case of assault at Cape Town central police station. \n“We will continue our fight against the securitisation of Parliament,” says Hunter. \nNational police spokesperson Brigadier Vishnu Naidoo said he could not comment as the matter was under investigation.
