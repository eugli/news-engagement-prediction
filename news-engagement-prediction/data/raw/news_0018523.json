Eric Greitens’ proposed budget could trigger the closure of some of Missouri’s long-term care facilities. \nAs part of his $27.6 billion spending plan , the political newcomer is calling for the rollback of a 3 percent Medicaid reimbursement rate increase that first went into effect more than a year ago under former Gov. Jay Nixon. \nIn addition, Greitens has proposed raising eligibility requirements for elderly and disabled people who now receive services in their own homes or in nursing homes, potentially leaving 20,000 of the 80,000 served by the program without care. \nThe effect of both moves is alarming, said Nikki Strong, executive vice president of the Missouri Health Care Association. \n“This is going to be utterly devastating for this population,” Strong told the Post-Dispatch Monday. \nThe changes are designed to save the state about $57.5 million in the fiscal year beginning July 1. As part of his first budget proposal, the political newcomer is trying to balance rising costs for programs like Medicaid against an expected drop in tax collections due to legislation that eliminated the corporate franchise tax and changed the way multistate corporations allocate their profits. \nGreitens has thus far said nothing publicly about his proposal affecting the state’s elderly population. He didn’t highlight the changes in his budget speech last week and, on Monday, he declined to take questions from reporters at an unrelated event in his Capitol office. \nIn testimony to a Senate committee Tuesday, Acting Budget Director Dan Haug outlined a lengthy list of what he called \"tough\" choices Greitens had to make in order to present a balanced budget. \nSen. Dan Brown, the chairman of the Senate committee overseeing the budget, acknowledged Tuesday that the change could result in closures, but possibly not a large number. \n\"I don't think its going to close a lot of them,\" the Rolla Republican said. \nWhile all Medicaid providers could be affected by the governor’s budget plan, not all will see significant reductions. \nHospitals, for example, may only see limited impact because their reimbursements for hospital care typically are more reliant on federal matching dollars and a special tax paid for by hospitals. \nStrong said nursing facilities are underfunded by an estimated $16 per patient day. If the reductions goes into place, that figure will increase to $20. In a letter being distributed to lawmakers this week, the long-term care organization paints a worst-case scenario of what will happen if the House and Senate go along with Greitens’ plan. “Facilities will be forced to close across the state; elderly and disabled residents will be homeless, the economy will suffer and unemployment rates will climb as the staff, so vital to the care of the residents, will be jobless,” the letter notes. In all, the more than 500 skilled nursing facilities in Missouri employ an estimated 50,000 people. “Every one of my facilities was counting on that 3 percent increase to their rate,” Strong said. “What Governor Greitens is doing is taking away that desperately needed rate increase.” Brown said Medicaid providers like nursing homes typically \"scream pretty loud\" when cuts are on the table. \"Its pretty serious for them,\" Brown said. Lawmakers have until May 5 to send Greitens a budget. Budget discussions began in the House and Senate this week. \n​ Kurt Erickson • 573-556-6181", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T12:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T10:42:46.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
