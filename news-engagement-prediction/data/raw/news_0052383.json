Grandmother with dementia left with severe burns after falling onto care home radiator \nThey had originally brought Bob and his brother over from Hungary as puppies, but shortly after arriving back in the UK they decided to give him up for adoption. \nThey thought they wouldn’t be able to cope with both dogs – and because Bob was deaf and had problems with gait and balance, they thought he would be much harder work. \nRescuers at The Mayhew Animal Home have since spent hours teaching Bob sign language, so that he’s able to communicate with his owners.
