You are doing what they [the ANC] did with the public protector's remedial action.\" 'Without the constitution we're a mob and not a nation' - Malema \nMalema said the EFF would approach the highest court in the land for direct access. \nIt wanted the court to compel Parliament and National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete to either impeach Zuma or make him facing a disciplinary hearing. \"It can't be business as usual. We want the court to compel Baleka to take action.\" \nThe National Assembly was due to start debating Zuma's state-of-the-nation address in Parliament on Tuesday. The EFF‚ like last year‚ is boycotting the debate. \nLast week the party was violently removed from the chamber after disrupting the President's address. Gloves off for Sona debate \nMalema said Parliament had once again violated the Constitution claiming that SA Police Service members were posing as Parliament's protection services member. \nMalema said the EFF had proof that SAPS members were used in the National Asssembly and the party was busy identifying them. \nIn 2015 the High Court in Cape Town ruled that police officers were not allowed to remove or arrests MPs for things they said or did in the National Assembly. \n\"You are prepared to protect an individual that has breached his oath of office and the Constitution and then beat up those who are exposing that and then leave the crook in Parliament‚\" he said referring to the ANC in Parliament. \"Parliament was meant to take him through an inquiry or impeachment process after the Constitutional Court [judgment] still Parliament does nothing. Parliament [was] told not to bring police [into the House]‚ they break the Constitution.\" - TMG Digital/BusinessLIVE Share  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:49:23.094+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
