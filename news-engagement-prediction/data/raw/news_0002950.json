Reuters/Amit Dave \nFinance Minister Arun Jaitley will present the Union budget 2017-2018 in Lok Sabha at 11 am today, the fourth budget by the Narendra Modi government. This year’s budget will be keenly watched following the demonetisation move by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8, 2016 which tendered invalid Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes, in a surprise move. Top economists have warned that the GDP could take a hit following the move and the budget to be presented today will, in all likelihood, take measures to ensure it’s a soft hit. \nThis will also be the first time that the Railway Budget will not be presented separately and will be a part of the Union budget presented by Arun Jaitley. Following the presentation of the Union budget, both Houses of Parliament will adjourn for the day. There were reports that the budget presentation may be postponed to February 2, following the passing away of Lok Sabha Member of Parliament E Ahamed. However, a call on this will be taken by Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan. \nHere are the LIVE updates – Union Budget 2017-18 \n9.30 am: Budget trivia – Until 1999, the Union budget used to be presented at 5 pm in the evening.
