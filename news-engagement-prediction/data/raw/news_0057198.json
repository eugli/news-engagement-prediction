You think you've finally picked the right color after multiple trips to the drug store, only to find out that you hate it and want to crawl into a hole until you're able dye it back again. \nBut now, with Fire , the color-changing hair dye from The Unseen , you can save your commitment phobia for your relationships and will never be bored with your hair again. SEE ALSO: Smart brush can teach you how to brush your hair without damaging it \nFounder of The Unseen in London and material alchemist Lauren Bowker specializes in combining science with art and design with performance. Her latest fashion venture, Fire, repeatedly changes color depending on the environment and temperature. According to Forbes , the semi-permanent colors change from black to red, black to white, silver to blue, blue to white, and black to yellow. \nThe Unseen released a few short films to capture the sorcery ahead of their London Fashion Week debut. \nThis type of magic is made possible with thermochromic ink, but Bowker explains that ink is made less toxic than ones you would find on the shelves through a process called â€˜polymeric stabilization,' in which chain-like molecules wrap around the irritant. Due to this process, a chemical reaction occurs in response to a stimuli, which in this case is a change in temperature. \nUnfortunately, the dye is not yet sold to the public. The formula needs to be absolutely perfected before releasing it to all of us regular hair-dyers. \nYou'll have to stick with boring old hair dye for now, but when this baby is released, you'll be able to live out your dream as a magical, color-changing unicorn.
