The department scores bridges on a nine-point scale, and while the deficient ones might not be imminently unsafe, they are classified in need of attention.\nMore than one in four bridges (173,919) are at least 50 years old and have never had major reconstruction work, according to the ARTBA analysis. State transportation officials have identified 13,000 bridges along interstates that need replacement, widening or major reconstruction, according to the group.\n\"America's highway network is woefully underperforming,\" said Alison Premo Black, the group's chief economics who conducted the analysis. \"It is outdated, overused, underfunded and in desperate need of modernization.\"\nThe five states with the most deficient bridges are Iowa with 4,968, Pennsylvania with 4,506, Oklahoma with 3,460, Missouri with 3,195 and Nebraska with 2,361.\nMore from USA Today: \nMcCurry, Fleischer debate White House turmoil under Trump \nNetanyahu, Trump meeting to set tone for U.S.-Israeli ties \nFired a month in: Michael Flynn's rise and very fast fall \nThe eight states where at least 15% of the bridges are deficient are: Rhode Island at 25%, Pennsylvania at 21%, Iowa and South Dakota at 20%, West Virginia at 17%, and Nebraska, North Dakota and Oklahoma at 15%.\nFinding a new funding stream for road and bridge construction is a priority for state and federal officials because the gas tax that primarily funds the highway trust fund hasn't kept pace with construction priorities as cars become more efficient.\nTransportation Secretary Elaine Chao said during her confirmation hearing that the highway trust fund is \"a huge issue\" because it spends $10 billion more each year than it collects.\nPresident Trump has proposed a $1 trillion infrastructure program for the next decade, but the source of funding remains uncertain.\n\"State and local transportation departments haven't been provided the resources to keep pace with the nation's bridge needs,\" Black said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T09:53:58.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
