Doctors said he weighed only 15 pounds when he died.\n“His cause of death was severe malnutrition, and the manner was homicide as ruled preliminarily by the coroner’s office,” Sheriff Greg Ewing said during a press conference. “Essentially in my opinion, he was starved to death.”\nThe boy was also blind and suffered from cerebral palsy.\n“It makes me mad, makes me mad that somebody could do this to a child, let alone a child that has physical handicaps and was blind ... was given to a guardian to take care of. And this is how he gets treated?” Ewing said. “This is what he deserves? To be starved to death? What kind of animals are they?”\nFollowing an investigation, officers arrested Chad Kraemer, 33, Hubert Kraemer, 56, Robin Kraemer, 53, and 30-year-old Sarah Travioli, the news station reported.\nThe group lived together in the house on Lewsader Avenue where Hubert and Robin Kraemer acted as Cameron’s gaurdians, Ewing said.\nTwo other children — ages 5 and 3, belonging to Chad Kraemer and Travioli — were removed from the house by the Department of Child Services, the Tribune Star reported.\nAll four were charged with neglect of a dependent resulting in death and neglect of a dependent. Chad Kraemer and Travioli were additionally charged with failure to report child neglect.\nAll of the suspects were being held in the Vigo County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bond and were slated to appear in court on Thursday.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:42:20.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
