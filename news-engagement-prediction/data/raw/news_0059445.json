Why Glam-Grunge Hair Color Is Back February 23, 2017 8:53 PM by Sophie Schulte-Hillen Photo: Getty Images Aside from that single blink-and-you’ll-miss-it brunette moment a couple of years ago, Suki Waterhouse has generally stayed in her It-Brit lane with thick sunny highlights—until now. The London-based front row favorite delivered a fresh surprise with a punkish solid dye job at Milan Fashion Week today. Waterhouse, who has confessed to souping up her street–to–red carpet mane with a Coca Cola rinse on occasion to avoid setting foot inside a salon, couldn’t resist a double dose of bleach for the shows—stealing the spotlight with platinum hair and a game-changing inch of dark roots.
