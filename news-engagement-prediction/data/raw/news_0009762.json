Stephen King thinks Anthony Weiner is ‘bright but troubled’; uses him to trash Trump Posted at 8:19 am on February 5, 2017 by Sam J. \nStephen King watched a documentary on Anthony Weiner that he found fascinating. \nNot disturbing. Fascinating. \nRight? Yikes. \nLate Saturday night, King tweeted this out about the disgraced politician: WEINER: Fascinating doc about a bright but troubled man. The underlying question is why the shit stuck to him…but not to Trump. \n— Stephen King (@StephenKing) February 5, 2017 \nMaybe King missed it, but Weiner is a DEVIANT, not just a troubled man. Repeat offender and such? \nOf course Weiner is a Democrat so that obviously gives him a pass with King, but wow. . @StephenKing A bright but troubled man accused of distributing child pornography. Have another drink. \n— Gay Guevara (@DefendWallSt) February 5, 2017 Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T15:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T15:27:31.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
