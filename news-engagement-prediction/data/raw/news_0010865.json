The two companies have introduced a new variant of the Huawei P9 smartphone called the Huawei P9 Friendship Edition, and this smartphone was actually announced in separate variants for Russia and China. The source also says that the two companies have decided to manufacture only 88 units (this number is actually considered to be lucky in the Chinese culture), which means its availability is quite limited, read on. \nThe difference between the Russian and Chinese variants of these two smartphones are their back covers, the back on the Russian model symbolizes the “might, power, traditions and character of the great country”, and the same can be said for the Chinese model as well. The Russian model comes with a golden frame which symbolizes ornaments and patterns traditional for Russian architecture. The center of the back of this smartphone contains a relief coat of arms of the Russian Federation and a tablet with lines from the national anthem. On top of all that, real alligator leather is also included here and gives some character to the back of the Russian model. The Chinese model is quite similar, but you’ll find somewhat different imagery on the back. This variant of the smartphone comes with a decorative pattern framing which symbolizes wisdom and wealth of the Chinese culture. The state Arms is made out of granite and gold, according to the source, and words from the Chinese anthem are visible on the back side of this smartphone. \nBoth of these devices are identical on the inside, as they sport the same specs as a regular Huawei P9 smartphone. This means that you’re getting a 5.2-inch fullHD (1920 x 1080) display, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The 3GB RAM variant had also been released by Huawei (regular variant), but this limited edition smartphones come with 4GB of RAM, both of them. Huawei’s Kirin 955 64-bit octa-core processor fuels the Huawei P9 Friendship Edition, and Android 6.0 Marshmallow comes pre-installed here with the company’s Emotion UI (EMUI) 4.1. Each of the two Huawei P9 Friendship Edition variants can be purchased from Caviar’s official site, and you’ll need to play 159 000 Rubles ($2,681) in order to get one.
