On the campaign trail, some of Trump's supporters would heckle and threaten reporters who covered his rallies, and his tweet Friday came 24 hours before his first political rally as President.

Donald Trump vs The Media \nA feisty Donald Trump takes on the media during his press conference at the White house. \nIt took the President two tries to properly post his message, which came soon after he arrived at his luxury, ocean-front estate for the weekend. The first tweet, which was quickly deleted, contained a number of extra spaces and listed the Times, CNN and NBC, ending with this conclusion: \"SICK!\" The second tweet added ABC and CBS to the list, while removing \"SICK!\" Both tweets labeled these organisations as being \"the fake news media,\" with \"fake news\" put into all-caps. The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes , @NBCNews , @ABC , @CBS , @CNN ) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 Related Content 'The leaks are absolutely real': Irritated Trump rants and raves at the media \nThe media has been credited with breaking stories about Trump's administration that have prompted action this week, including asking for the resignation of his national security adviser and his nominee for labor secretary withdrawing from consideration. Meanwhile, the president has berated the press for allegedly distorting facts and not painting a rosy portrait of the country under his leadership. At a news conference at the White House on Thursday, Trump uttered the words \"fake news\" seven times. \n\"Much of the media in Washington, DC - along with New York, Los Angeles, in particular - speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system,\" Trump said early in the news conference, which lasted an hour and 15 minutes.

We have to talk to find out what's going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control.\" \nThat night, the Republican Party and Trump's campaign websites posted a \"Mainstream Media Accountability Survey\" that asked 25 questions that were worded in a way that would never be allowed in a scientific survey. The survey formalised Trump's attacks and his insinuation that media outlets are working against the American people. It's unclear what, if anything, the data will be used for, and participants are required to give their name, email address and Zip code.
