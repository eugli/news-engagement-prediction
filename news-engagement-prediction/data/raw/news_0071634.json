America exposed as a country full of simpletons who allowed this cartoon lunatic to be ‘elected.’” Before it was deleted, he was called out by conservative talk radio host Dan Proft, who wondered whether media fairness standards applied to Giangreco. \nGiangreco was suspended in 2004 for making jokes about fires in Detroit after the Pistons won the NBC Championship, and had to apologize in 2014 for making a joking reference to suicide. His bio on the station’s website says he is the “ABC 7 Chicago sports director and primary sports anchor/reporter for the Number One rated 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. newscasts.” Giangreco has worked at WLS since 1994 and is the brother of Democratic political consultant Pete Giangreco, who has worked with Barack Obama and Rahm Emanuel.
