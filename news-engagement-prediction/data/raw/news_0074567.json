John Kasich thinks House Republicans will need to reach out to Democrats in order to pass health-care reform that won’t cut off coverage for millions of people. But he’s not sure they will.\nSpeaking on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, the former Republican presidential candidate said too many House Republicans are determined to repeal all parts of the Affordable Care Act on principle.\n‘There’s going to be a problem in the House of getting anything out of there that still provides coverage to people . . . That’s why the Republicans have to reach out to some of the Democrats.’ Gov. John Kasich “I think there are some very conservative Republicans in the House who are going to say, ‘just get rid of the whole thing,’“ he said. “That’s not acceptable when you have 20 million people, or 700,000 people in my state, because where do the mentally ill go? Where do the drug addicted go?”\nKasich said Republicans who are truly focused on improving the ACA will have to reach out to Democrats instead of relying on those hard-core GOP members, but “I don’t know whether this is going to happen.”\nKasich also acknowledged the recent town-hall protests and voter anger over a possible repeal, saying lawmakers are getting the message loud and clear.\n“I think it’s having an impact from the standpoint of, ‘hey, people are watching,’” Kasich said. “I don’t think they mind reform, but don’t take everything away.”\nKasich voiced his concerns following a meeting with President Donald Trump on Friday, and a day after the nation’s governors were briefed on the Republicans’ potential replacement plan. According to a recent poll , 54% of Americans approve of the Affordable Care Act, its highest level of support ever.\nMore from MarketWatch These 4 colors can be the kiss of death when selling your home Here’s how inflation will impact your portfolio in 2017 America’s battle with drugs: Fatal overdoses spike among white, middle-aged men", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:06:07.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
