Air Force (Atlantic Hockey) 16. Bemidji State (WCHA) \nStep 1: Awarding seeds \nNo. 1 seeds: Minnesota Duluth, Denver, Boston University, Minnesota No. 2 seeds: Harvard, Western Michigan, Union, Providence No. 3 seeds: North Dakota, Boston College, Penn State, UMass-Lowell No. 4 seeds: Cornell, Vermont, Air Force, Bemidji State \nStep 2: Placing hosts \nNorth Dakota is locked into the West regional in Fargo. Meanwhile, the East regional is being held in Providence, R.I., but the host school is Brown University. Providence College is not required to be placed there and, at least for this round of bracketology, wasn’t. \nStep 3: Placing the teams \nLooking at this bracket, a lot of it settles pretty nicely. There are a few necessary moves to avoid intra-conference matchups in the first round. \nThere are still a few questions to answer, however. The first is where to place the No. 1 overall seed. That seems pretty easy this time around. North Dakota’s ranking this week has them at No. 9, which makes for a perfect scenario. Top seed Minnesota Duluth can go to the closest regional available to them, with the downside being that the No. 3 seed in their region is essentially playing at home, with tickets already sold out. UMD has had North Dakota’s number this year and it’s a much easier trip to go to Fargo than it is to Cincinnati. Watch Now NCAA Hockey: Top Five Plays That leaves us with only a few adjustments to the natural order in the name of avoiding first-round intra-conference matchups and keeping an eye on attendance for the regionals. The easiest flip to make was the one to avoid a Boston University-Vermont first-round matchup, due to their conference ties. Cornell and Vermont simply changed spots.\nAs it stands, Providence would have to travel to Fargo despite having a regional literally in their city. It is conceivable that the committee would move Providence to the East regional, but I’m not sure it’s going to be a big enough enticement for them to really upset bracket integrity among the two- and three-seeds. That’s still a change I would not rule out. \nBased on all of that, here is what I came up with for a bracket: \nWest – Fargo, N.D. \n1 Minnesota Duluth vs. 16 Bemidji State 8 Providence vs. 9 North Dakota \nReason: A traditional top-seed bracket makes this pretty easy, aside from putting Providence on a plane with a regional right in their backyard. With the other maneuvering that would have to be done to accommodate PC playing at home, I’m not sold that the committee would bend far enough to make it work, especially with other teams close enough to help attendance. \nNortheast – Manchester, N.H. \n2 Denver vs. 15 Air Force 7 Union vs. 10 Boston College \nReason: With Denver and Air Force having a long trip ahead of them no matter what, sending them to Manchester helps maintain a traditional No. 2 regional bracket. Meanwhile, Boston College’s presence helps on the attendance front. You could make a case for flipping Vermont and Air Force here, too, but I didn’t feel strongly enough about it to make the change. \nEast – Providence, R.I. \n3 Boston University vs. 13 Cornell 5 Harvard vs. 12 UMass-Lowell \nReason: This is where we fudge the bracket integrity just a bit to help maximize attendance in two regionals. With three Massachusetts schools, there are three teams with short drives. Then, with Vermont already having to be moved away from BU as a first-round matchup, Cornell ends up in a tougher, but essentially unavoidable situation. \nMidwest – Cincinnati, Ohio \n4 Minnesota vs. 14 Vermont 6 Western Michigan vs. 11 Penn State \nReason: Keeping Minnesota in the Midwest may make for more manageable travel for both the team and its fans. I also think Penn State fans would travel fairly well for the school’s first tournament berth and this is close enough to drive out to. Vermont is the only team really far out of the regional footprint, but I’ll still lean just a bit more heavily on bracket integrity this time. That necessary switch between Vermont and Cornell isn’t worth making sweeping changes to where the four-seeds will play.
