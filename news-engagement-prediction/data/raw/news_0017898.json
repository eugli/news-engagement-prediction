It helps you get to sleep as they stay cool just long enough for you to nod off.\nA damp towel or ice pack are also recommended bedfellows.\nAVOID ICY WATER Surprisingly, during hot weather the first thing you want to do is reach for a glass of icy cold water.\nBut cold water can slow digestion, which in turn slows your metabolism, constricting blood vessels and your ability cool off.\nStay hydrated with room temperature water instead.\nWEAR LOOSE CLOTHING\nLoose fitting cotton fabrics are your best bet to keep cool both during the day and while you sleep at night.\nLight coloured clothing is also recommended to reflect light and heat.\nAVOID THE ELECTRONICS\nDitching the electronics like phones and laptops is also advised, as these products can emit heat.\nSwitching them off will also keep your electricity bill down.\nIt's also possible to make your own air conditioning at home with a shallow dish of ice in front of a pedestal fan\nFrom staying hydrated, keeping out of the sun and under air conditioning, there are ways to beat the heat - even eating an ice cream\nOne friendly neighbour offers up their house for passersby to cool themselves down with in the Sydney's inner west\nOne man shows off his national pride as he tries to stay cool by the pool\nSpeaking to 702 ABC radio last year during the blistering heat, sustainability expert Michael Mobbs offered up some other slightly bizarre but effective advice for keeping cool.\nMr Mobbs claims drinking a hot cup of tea works in the same way as the fan blowing cold water and will also help to eventually cool down the body.\n'When you sweat, that evaporates and cools your skin,' He said. 'That's the funny thing about a hot cup of tea cooling you down on a hot day.'\nHe pointed out that a lack of tree in urban areas also become a serious problem during heatwaves as the exposed road surfaces can reach up to 70 degrees during the day.\n'You could cook an egg on them,' he said. 'In many parts of Sydney [the roads] will still be reading 40, 50 or 60 degrees at 7 pm at night.'\nHe suggests planting a few trees to block out the blistering sunlight, or if that's not an option plan ahead and start growing a passion fruit vine on a western facing wall, which will eventually form a canopy.\nFor a quick fix, heat proof curtains with a thick, matted side to keep the heat out are also effective.\nHeading to the coast is a popular choice for many trying to escape the heat\nMeteorologists said temperatures on Saturday could break 20-year-old records\nNew South Wales could experience its hottest February day on record, as extreme heatwave conditions peak across the state\nHOW TO KEEP COOL IN SUMMER During the day, keep all windows and doors closed and the curtains drawn and open all of the doors and windows at night.\nCreate a homemade air conditioner by placing a bowl of cold water in front of a fan.\nPoint your fan out of the window if the inside of the home is hotter than the outside to expel the hot air.\nPlan for next year and start growing a passion fruit vine on a western facing wall to cut the heat by 30 per cent.\nBuy a pelmet [ for the top of your curtains to stop the heat travelling up to the roof and spreading throughout the house.\nUse a barbecue instead of heating up the house with the oven\nWith rolling blackouts threatening the possibility of using electric methods to keep cool, it's recommended you try and limit the amount of sunlight coming into your home.\nBy closing the windows and curtains during the day, the sun from the south side can be blocked out and the home stays relatively cool.\nElectricity demand could jump by 50 per cent in western Sydney, according to Endeavour Energy, which will place emergency crews on stand-by in case of network faults.\nEnergy Minister Don Harwin has encouraged sweaty residents to save energy by turning the air con up to 26C, adjusting fridge temperatures, switching off unused electrical appliances and turning off lights where it's safe to do so.\n'The NSW government is doing everything we can to ensure a power outage is avoided but we encourage the community to reduce their energy use where possible,' Mr Harwin said.\nBureau of Meteorology forecasts indicate temperatures will reach the mid-40s in many inland areas and high 30s along the coast for the next two days\nSydney to sweat through the weekend - as record heat is predicted for Sydney\nThe weather bureau is predicting 39C in the city and 45C in the west on Saturday with lower maximums likely on Sunday\nHOW TO SURVIVE A HEATWAVE Try and drink two to three litres of water throughout the day\nDress in lighter clothing and avoid dark colours which absorb heat and light\nKeep an eye on family friends and neighbours, especially those vulnerable to the soaring temperatures\nTry to stay out of the sun and wear sunscreen and protective clothing\nSeek air conditioning, whether it's at your home, the shops, the library or at the movies\nLook after your pets.

It can be lethal, as we see all too often,' RSPCA NSW Chief Inspector David OShannessy says.\n'It only takes six minutes for an animal to die from heat stroke. Cars parked in the sun can reach temperatures in excess of 80 degrees Celsius, and can remain dangerously hot even if the windows are open.\n'Evidently, even cars parked in the shade – even in an underground carpark – can reach lethal temperatures. A dog cannot sweat in these conditions and panting increases the heat in the car.'\nSymptoms of heat stress in animals include excessive panting for dogs and any kind of panting or increase in breathing for cats, birds, rabbits, ferrets or Guinea Pigs.\nAlso look out for dark red gums or tongue, confusion and vomiting.", "external_links": ["http://www.abc.net.au/radio/sydney/"], "published": "2017-02-10T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:15:24.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
