The F-35 achieved this remarkable ratio in a drastically increased threat environment that included radar jamming, increased air threats, and surface-to-air missile batteries. \n“In the past, the non-kinetic effects were not fully integrated into the kinetic fight,” Col. Robert Cole, the Air Forces Cyber Forward director, said in a statement . \nBut now F-35s take on cyber threats and electronic warfare in addition to enemy surveillance and conventional, or kinetic, threats. \n“This integration in an exercise environment allows our planners and warfighters to understand how to best integrate these, learn their capabilities and limitations, and become ready to use [these combined resources for maximum] effect against our adversaries,” Cole said. \nStaff Sgt. Darlene Seltmann/US Air Force \nBut the F-35s didn't just shoot down the enemy, they used their sensor-fusion and datalink abilities to talk to other planes and help them sniff out threats they would never have seen on their own. \n“Before where we would have one advanced threat and we would put everything we had—F-16s, F-15s, F-18s, missiles, we would shoot everything we had at that one threat just to take it out—now we are seeing three or four of those threats at a time,” Lt. Col. George Watkins, 34th Fighter Squadron commander, told Aviation Week. \n“Just between [the F-35] and the [F-22] Raptor we are able to geo-locate them, precision-target them, and then we are able to bring the fourth-generation assets in behind us after those threats are neutralized. It’s a whole different world out there for us now.” \nThe ability for fifth-generation US aircraft to detect threats and send that information to legacy planes meets an urgent need for the US military. \nEven after the F-35 runs out of missiles, it can still pass valuable targeting data to legacy planes laden with bombs and missiles. Jim Hazeltine/US Air Force \nAs adversarial nations like China and Russia constantly improve their counter-stealth abilitie s and air defenses, numbers increasingly matter . \nThe F-35 has repeatedly hit cost and schedule overruns during its production and is now years behind schedule. But the latest performance at Red Flag proves that even a handful of F-35s can improve an entire squadron's performance. \nThe current Red Flag exercise will conclude on February 10.
