Speaking to the Racing Post on Monday, she said: \"He'll remain in intensive care today and tonight, and they'll review the situation tomorrow. \n\"He doesn't need any surgery and he had a bit of food at lunch. He's just very sleepy and he's back to bed. He had a very severe concussion, but his CT scan came back okay and the best thing for him is sleep and time.\" \nShe added: \"The best thing is he's out of a coma, breathing on his own and able to move of his own accord, because when I got on the plane the last I knew was he was in a coma and breathing through apparatus. It wasn't until I landed I learned any more, which came as a massive relief. Everything else is a bonus.\" \nA crack in the ice some 150m from the finish line meant water had come up and undermined the integrity of the racing surface, the organisers stated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T22:19:10.308+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
