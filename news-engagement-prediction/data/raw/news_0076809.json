Article continues below \nWhile many like to discredit the value of winning the EFL Cup, it is clearly a competition Jose Mourinho respects after he equalled Sir Alex Ferguson and Brian Clough's record with a fourth victory in the final. \nThe nature of the game and dramatic way it was won only added to the celebrations from Man United's stars after the final whistle.
