(ANU: Stuart Hay) \nThe school has had a tumultuous few years after a major restructure in 2012 resulted in job losses , funding cuts, and a drop in services offered, including the axing of one of two undergraduate courses, and a reduction in one-on-one teaching opportunities. \nToday Professor Lampl was named to lead the school along with Paul McMahon as deputy head. \nProfessor Lampl said he was excited to build a modern school of music from the ground up. \n\"They can expect the highest calibre of performance training and concerts from the students, the highest calibre of teaching, the highest calibre of research, all in a very 21st century context,\" he told ABC Radio Canberra. \nDr McMahon said they had been appointed at \"a crucial time for the school\". \n\"We know what the university, the community and the profession expect from the school,\" he said. \n\"We now want to deliver so many of those expectations, within a framework of strong education, quality practice and insightful research.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:20:46.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
