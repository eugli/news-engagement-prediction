They simulated sexual behavior, stripped one boy down to his underwear and taunted the pair while the coaches did nothing to stop it. \nSurveillance footage from the bus validated the allegations. According to News West, the video also recorded one student saying, \"help me.\" Another said \"We (expletive) the (expletive) out of you,\" while both coaches neglected to help the students. \nARRESTED: Texas student accused of blackmailing teacher after alleged sexual relationship \nGomez, who is also an eighth-grade teacher at the school, was driving the bus. He allegedly yelled homosexual slurs and told them to \"keep it in their pants.\" Gutierrez, who was seen on his cell phone, did nothing to stop the abuse. \nGutierrez could be heard saying: \"Ain't funny. Y'all better not put this on social media!\" and added that \"he wasn't going to jail for any of you (expletive).\" He also instructed the boys, some of whom were capturing the acts on their cell phone, to delete anything they might have posted. \nGROWING PROBLEM IN TEXAS: Texas seeing boom in teacher-student sex scandals \nThe coaches allegedly held back the students, telling them to explain to their parents that they were having a team meeting, presumably in an attempt to protect themselves. \n\"Evidence of the behavior discovered during our investigation requires immediate action. I appreciate our police department and all district staff involved in this investigation for their professionalism and immediate attention to this matter. Their approach proves that the safety of our students is our number one priority and we will go above and beyond in protecting our students from any threat to their safety while in our care,\" said Mr. Rod Schroder, MISD Superintendent said .
