(Ross D. Franklin / AP) Mark Gonzales 's 1969 Cubs were better than Grace's 1989 team that won the National League East .\n\"Santo would argue how much better his team was,\" Grace recalled last week. \"I guess he had a point because they had Hall of Famers in Ernie ( Banks ), Fergie (Jenkins) and Billy (Williams). \n\"But I'd always tell him, 'How did you guys screw it up?' \" \nJust as a World Series title cured more than a century of frustration, an official return of Grace to the organization would strengthen the link between the franchise's best players of the 20th century and the current cast. \nDuring this harmonious time for the Cubs, the return of Grace in an ambassador role would fit seamlessly. Grace, 52, a three-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove first baseman during his 13 seasons with the Cubs followed by three with the Diamondbacks , is out of a gig. He has considerable broadcasting experience and is under consideration as a pre and postgame television commentator for the Diamondbacks, who elected not to retain him as an assistant hitting coach after Torey Lovullo took over as manager. \nGrace emphasized that he would be working for Fox Arizona if hired for Diamondbacks telecasts, thus ruling out any conflict of interest if he works for another organization. \n\"I've always kept plenty of doors and phone lines open,\" said Grace, who didn't solicit the idea of an official return to the Cubs. \"I've been asked to attend the Cubs Convention, but it happens at the same time as (the Diamondbacks') fantasy camp. They also asked me to throw out the first pitch before a playoff game, but it was on one day's notice and I couldn't get out in time.\" Mark Grace Stephen J.

(Stephen J. Carrera / AP) \nThe Cubs didn't respond to an inquiry about Grace. As the father of two teenage boys in Paradise Valley, Ariz., Grace knows family time is precious. At the same time, he notices how Diamondbacks legend (and former Cubs player) Luis Gonzalez relishes his special assistant role from evaluating major-league players to greeting sponsors and fans. \nGrace also seemed curious as to how smoothly Hall of Famer and former Cubs teammate Ryne Sandberg rejoined the organization as a special assistant after being bypassed for consideration to replace Lou Piniella as manager and spending 41/2 seasons in the Phillies organization as a minor-league and major-league manager. \nSandberg, 57, stressed how important it was to stay in contact with the organization and appreciated that Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts gave his blessing to pursue managing opportunities with the Phillies with the option to rejoin the Cubs. \n\"It takes two groups to get it done,\" Sandberg said before a panel discussion at the Cubs Convention last month. \"If it's a good fit, it's a good fit. Obviously, I played next to Mark for (eight) years. He was fantastic. It's up to them to work something out if that's something everyone wants to do.\" \nGrace can offer plenty to an organization that has embraced several former players with shorter organization roots. A lifetime .303 hitter, Grace's habit of staying in the clubhouse to assess that night's performance can rub off on players at the minor-league level. \nAs a former assistant hitting coach, Grace is wise enough not to step on the feet of the Cubs' current instructors. Grace's two alcohol-related arrests can serve as a lesson to younger players as Grace has stayed out of trouble the last four seasons and remains in good standing with the Diamondbacks organization. \nHeck, the Cubs hired Manny Ramirez, who twice tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs, as a hitting consultant two years ago and several pupils praised the former slugger. \nGrace's standing ovation during his first at-bat at Wrigley Field as a visiting player in 2001 reinforces that he left in good standing with fans — including many that might be curious to know if the 1989 Cubs could have reached the World Series if the Giants ' Will Clark hadn't correctly read the lips of Greg Maddux before hitting a grand slam, and if Les Lancaster hadn't forgotten the count before grooving a home run to Robby Thompson in Games 1 and 3 of the National League Championship Series . \n\"With (Rick) Sutcliffe, Maddux and (Mike) Bielecki, I truly believe we would have given Oakland a better test,\" Grace said. \nCubs fans would love to hear that story in a large setting. \nmgonzales@chicagotribune.com \nTwitter @MDGonzales \nComing off the World Series win, the Cubs have only a few key roster spots to fill. \nBut a second consecutive lengthy postseason combined with a longer spring training will necessitate that several seasoned veterans be brought along slower than usual. That policy worked well last spring as starters Jake Arrieta, Kyle Hendricks, Jon Lester and John Lackey helped the rotation compile 989 regular-season innings — the most in the major leagues. The addition of Jon Jay will give manager Joe Maddon plenty of lineup and outfield combinations. \nHere are the locks, the good bets and the long shots.
