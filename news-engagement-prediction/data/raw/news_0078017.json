We are where we are not because of God’s design, given our human and natural resources, but because of bad leadership that could not put the resources to good use. \n“The countries that are better than us today are better because they are committed, focused and understand what it takes to develop. \n“Until we get the problem of leadership right, we will not go anywhere,” Obasanjo said. \nOn his part, the guest speaker, Shamsudeen Usman, a former minister of finance, noted that the country has a huge infrastructural gap. \nMr. Usman, in a paper, “Promoting Public Private Partnership As a Panacea for Accelerated Growth and Development” said the country needs foreign capital and expertise to supplement the resources that the country can afford to generate. \nHe described the Public/Private Partnership (PPP) as a crucial tool in addressing the infrastructural gap in the country, adding however, that its potential has not been fully tapped. \nMr. Usman gave example of countries like India, Malaysia and South Africa among other countries that successfully deployed PPP to achieve accelerated socio-economic growth and development. \nHe identified the problems of politics, absence of strong legal framework, inconsistency in policy implementation, lack of clear goals and coordination as hindrances to Nigeria’s ability to tap the benefits of PPP. \nAccording to him, the country’s legal framework and budgetary approval processes must be reviewed for PPP to work efficiently in the country. \n“Similarly, there is the need for high political support, post transaction monitoring and evaluation, alternative dispute resolution mechanism to ensure smooth operation of the PPP strategy, ” he added. \nEarlier, the President of the KADCCIMA, Muheeba Dankaka, explained that the theme was chosen to highlight the need for collaboration between the public and private sector to enhance the business environment through massive infrastructure development. \n“The PPP, if well tapped, could maintain and sustain the productive and manufacturing sectors, which would in turn ensure equitable distribution of wealth. \n“To achieve this, government and the private sector must work together”. \n(NAN) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T17:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T12:40:28.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
