\nUNITED’S SUPERSTAR BENCH ALREADY SEEN IN FIFA \nManchester United named the most expensive bench ever for their clash with Blackburn. \nSeven players with a combined value of £192 million ($311m) started the fifth round tie as substitutes. \nAmong them was Paul Pogba (£89m), Juan Mata (£37m), Eric Bailly (£30m), Luke Shaw (£30m), Bastian Schweinsteiger (£6m), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (free), and academy product Dean Henderson (free). Manchester United's bench = $311 million Source: Twitter \nBut for players of FIFA 17, it probably wasn’t the first time they’d seen Ibrahimovic and Pogba warming the bench together. \nThe first game you play in the new ‘The Journey’ mode sees Alex Hunter (the virtual player the user controls) take his spot next to Ibrahimovic and Pogba on United’s bench before being substituted on to try and make an impact. \nAgainst Blackburn it was a slightly different story. Both Ibrahimovic and Pogba came on to combine for a superb matchwinning goal to send the Red Devils through to the quarterfinals where they will meet Chelsea. Alex Hunter next to Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba Source: FOX SPORTS \nSTAT PROVES IMPORTANCE OF POGBA-ZLATAN RELATIONSHIP \nZlatan Ibrahimovic now has 24 goals for Manchester United this season, which is the tied most (with Anthony Martial) of any Red Devil since the start of last season. \nHowever, his tally wouldn’t be quite so high without Pogba, who’s five United assists have all been for Ibrahimovic. 5 - All five of Paul Pogba's assists for Manchester United in 2016/17 have been for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Telepathy. — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 19, 2017 \nJOSE WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY BLACKBURN’S OPENER \nUnited eventually triumphed 2-1 over Blackburn, but after 15 minutes it seemed the game could pan out very differently. \nRovers broke the deadlock when Marvin Emnes played a perfect through ball for Danny Graham to run onto and thump past Sergio Romero into the far corner. \nIt had the Blackburn supporters on their feet, but Jose Mourinho was equally as impressed. He was captured on camera nodding and applauding Graham’s effort. \nMourinho was right to keep a cool head as 10 minutes later Marcus Rashford levelled the scoreline when he was played in by Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Jose applauds opposition goal 0:40 \nTHE JOSE-CHELSEA MIND GAMES HAVE ALREADY STARTED \nSpeaking after the match, Mourinho didn’t take long to comment on the looming quarterfinal against his former team Chelsea. \nHis main point was that while United have a piling up of fixtures to play, the Blues basically only have the FA Cup to focus on due to only being involved in the Premier League, which he thinks “they are champions” already. \n“I have to play Saint-Etienne, I have to play the EFL Cup final, I have to play hopefully another opponent in the Europa League,” said Mourinho. \n“I have to fight for a top-four position in the Premier League. I have so many things to think about. 'Impossible to do better' 0:38 \n“Chelsea can only think about that [the FA Cup] because they are champions and they have nothing else to fight for. \n“The match is in one month’s time, so I don’t want to think about it. \n“We’re going to fight for the FA Cup, but the League Cup is the one we have a 50 per cent possibility to win. \n“And the next one is to get a result against St Etienne on Wednesday and be in the last 16 of the Europa League.” \nBut history is on the side of Mourinho’s team. United have won seven out of nine of their last FA Cup matches against the Blues. \nDon’t choke Chelsea! 7 - Manchester United have won seven of their last nine FA Cup ties v Chelsea, but have lost the last two (2007 Final, R6 in 2013).

A post shared by Cesc Fàbregas (@cescf4bregas) on Feb 18, 2017 at 2:30pm PST Report: Wolves get Cup Blues 1:28 \nDIEGO COSTA AND WILLIAN’S PUNISHMENT FOR KENEDY \nAgainst Wolves, Costa scored his first goal in 400 minutes, while Willian had set up Pedro for Chelsea’s opener in the 65th minute. \nBut the fun didn’t end their for the Blues’ stars. \nAfter the game, Willian posted some amusing videos on Instagram featuring Costa and also Kenedy. \nThe young Brazilian, who was an unused substitute against Wolves, must have lost some sort of bet because he was subjected to this punishment from the Chelsea duo.

Massive upset in the FA Cup 0:38 \nSUTTON BOSS PREDICTS HAMMERING \nHowever, Sutton boss Paul Doswell is worried his side could be swept aside by Arsene Wenger’s if he plays a full strength team. \nDoswell said: “If he plays the team that beat Southampton 5-0 in the last round, then that would hammer us. \n“I think if you see Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez on the team sheet, our chance doesn’t come beyond nought. \n“But, if they put another team out, then it does get up to the ones and two per cents. \n“Our only chance is if he puts out an Under-23 reserve side out because National League sides can compete against academy players. Then we would have a real chance. \n“If we were to get a draw and we could get back to the Emirates Stadium it would be one of the biggest results in the cup’s history and for the players. \n“The best result for the players would be a 0-0. \n“I think half of my team support Arsenal, so the chance for them to go to the Emirates and just have a great day out would be their preferred result.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:35:04.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
