Deportation plan brings relief, worry Will police help with deportations? Little appetite at AZ police agencies Mass deportations: Cities unprepared Trump actions: 'People are scared' Arizona mom has been deported Why mom didn't apply for citizenship Migrants call protocols 'an attack' Trump spares 'dreamers' Trump voters cheer new guidelines Quiz: Immigration in U.S. FULL COVERAGE While carrying out a campaign promise to greatly expand deportations, Trump has expressed sympathy for so-called dreamers, undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.\n\"We’re going to show great heart,\" Trump said at a news conference last week . \"DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have, because you have these incredible kids, in many cases — not in all cases. In some of the cases they’re having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely incredible kids — I would say mostly — they were brought here in such a way — it's a very, very tough subject.\"\nNo guarantees Immigrant advocates, however, say that while Trump's comments are encouraging, the new rules issued Tuesday offer no guarantee Trump will keep the DACA program. They also fear the new rules will make it easier for immigration authorities to revoke deportation protections for even minor traffic infraction, such as speeding.\n“I think what we were expecting is an explicit decision about DACA, and we certainly haven’t gotten that yet.”\nKamal Essaheb, director of policy and advocacy for National Immigration Law Center. \"I think what we were expecting is an explicit decision about DACA, and we certainly haven’t gotten that yet, said Kamal Essaheb, director of policy and advocacy for National Immigration Law Center.\nThe sweeping DHS memos issued Tuesday instruct Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to immediately begin implementing deportation rules that put virtually all of the nation's 11 million undocumented individuals at risk of deportation. The new rules, which rescind narrower deportation priorities put in place by the Obama administration, broaden deportation priorities to include not just immigrants convicted of crimes, but those charged with crimes and those who have \"committed acts which constitute a chargeable criminal offense.\"\nMORE: Migrants on Trump memos: 'What came out today is scary' \nThe memos, however, specifically exempt dreamers covered by Obama's 2012 DACA program, as well two other programs Obama created in 2014 to shield from deportation additional groups of undocumented immigrants.\nOne program expanded the number of dreamers who qualified for the original DACA program. The other, called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans, offered the same deportation protections and work permits to certain undocumented immigrants with children who are either U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents. The two programs, however, were never implemented after they were blocked by the courts.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Local activists oppose President Donald Trump's executive actions   Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

Even if we just get a traffic ticket, they could make case that we're a public-safety risk.\"\nThe new rules are especially concerning because they call for ICE to renew partnerships with local police agencies to train officers on the street to double as immigration-enforcement agents, increasing the likelihood that DACA recipients will be placed in the cross-hairs of federal immigration authorities, said Reyna Montoya, a DACA recipient originally from Mexico who is executive director of Aliento, a Phoenix-based advocacy group.\nRELATED: Trump supporters cheer new guidelines on deportation \nIn the past, DACA recipients with fewer than three misdemeanor convictions generally were allowed to remain in the country, she said.\n“It’s very important for people with DACA to understand it could be taken away for a simple mistake.”\nKarina Ruiz, executive director of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition She cited two recent examples that suggest ICE already is getting tougher with DACA recipients: the arrest of 23-year-old DACA recipient Daniel Ramirez Medina in Seattle, who ICE officials say is a \" self-admitted gang member,\" according to the Los Angeles Times , and 19-year-old DACA recipient Josue Romero, who was taken into ICE custody after being arrested on a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge, according to the San Antonio Express-News .\n\"We see the cases in Washington state ... and in Texas, where (federal immigration authorities) didn’t really respect DACA,\" Montoya said.\nKarina Ruiz, a DACA recipient from Mexico and executive director of the Arizona Dream Act Coalition, is cautioning DACA recipients to do everything they can to avoid contact with the police.\n\"It’s more fragile than ever under this administration,\" she said. \"It’s very important for people with DACA to understand it could be taken away for a simple mistake.\"\nReporters Maria Polletta of The Arizona Republic and Alan Gomez of USA Today contributed to this article.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:39:38.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
