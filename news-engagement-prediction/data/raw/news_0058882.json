"text": "Driving the Day WELL, YESTERDAY didn’t go too badly. President Donald Trump went to the African-American History museum, where he disavowed racism and spoke out against a new wave of anti-Semitism. He didn’t tweet his thoughts until 6:23 p.m., when he said the “so-called angry crowds” at town halls around the country were “planned out by liberal activists.” There were no massive blowups to speak of. Sean Spicer seemed spry during his press briefing, too. \nCAN THE STREAK CONTINUE TODAY? We’ll see. At some point this week, the president will release his revised travel ban, which will suck up much of the oxygen in town. But today, Trump gets his daily intelligence briefing, has a lunch, where he will speak about the federal budget and then has a meeting about his spending blueprint with staff. Remember: Trump says he’ll have a budget soon. Like, in a few weeks. At 4 p.m., he’ll hold a legislative affairs session, where he’ll discuss tax reform, a health care overhaul and his Supreme Court strategy. Seems easy, right? VP MIKE PENCE is in St. Louis, where he’ll visit an equipment and engine dealer to discuss the economy.\nStory Continued Below\nBULLETIN -- HOWARD DEAN , the former Vermont governor and DNC chairman, endorsed SOUTH BEND MAYOR PETE BUTTIGIEG for DNC chairman. He announced the endorsement on \"Morning Joe.\"\n**SUBSCRIBE to Playbook : http://politi.co/1M75UbX \nNEW ON THE WASHINGTON POST HOMEPAGE -- “Democracy dies in darkness.” BOB WOODWARD also said the phrase on “Face the Nation” Feb. 19. http://cbsn.ws/2lEWSMj \nTHE NEW WHITE HOUSE -- NYT A1 -- “3 Generals Bound by Iraq Will Guide Trump on Security,” by Peter Baker and Eric Schmitt: “At one point or another, they each strode the sands of Iraq, fighting on the unforgiving battlefield of America’s costliest war since Vietnam. Now all three will sit around the table in the White House Situation Room, steering a new president through the treacherous crosscurrents of a stormy world.\n“President Trump’s appointment of H. R. McMaster, an Army lieutenant general, as his new national security adviser creates a powerful troika of senior officers who served in Iraq, teaming him up with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, both retired four-star Marine generals. This administration is the first to have all three security jobs filled by senior military veterans at the same time. The ascension of the three generals to political jobs at the National Security Council reflects the rise of a generation of military leaders that came of age during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that began after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Each officer saw up close what a losing war looked like and took away lessons about how to avoid repeating fatal mistakes. Each got to where he is today in part by bucking the military hierarchy.” http://nyti.ms/2luf8G4 \n-- “Cabinet picks clash with White House over hiring,” by Josh Dawsey and Andrew Restuccia: “The White House’s deep involvement in hiring decisions across the government is frustrating some of President Donald Trump’s Cabinet secretaries, spurring early tussles between the president’s advisers and leaders of federal agencies. White House officials have sometimes rejected candidates who have previously criticized the president — even if they boast sterling credentials or have the endorsement of top Republicans. And they’ve often imposed their choices on agencies, according to more than a dozen people inside and close to the administration. Many Cabinet nominees joined the administration believing they’d have wide latitude to pick lieutenants, but they’re beginning to realize Trump’s powerful advisers are looking over their shoulders. The White House’s approach has already slowed hiring — and the dozens of vacancies at key agencies could make it more difficult to implement some of Trump’s policy proposals.” http://politi.co/2l6OG4I \nNEW POLITICO/MORNING CONSULT POLL -- “Poll: Support for Obamacare is rising,” by Steven Shepard: “The 2010 healthcare law is becoming more popular, even as it heads toward the chopping block -- further complicating efforts by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans to repeal and replace it. While both Trump and Republicans in both chambers of Congress campaigned on repealing the Affordable Care Act -- passed exclusively with Democratic votes and signed by then-President Barack Obama — a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll shows voters are now split evenly on the law. Forty-five percent of registered voters approve of the law, the poll shows, and 45 percent disapprove. In early January, before Trump took office, a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll showed only 41 percent of voters approved of the health care law, compared with 52 percent who disapproved. And now there’s little consensus on what Congress and the Trump administration should do next. Only 12 percent want to keep the law in place, while 24 percent want to repeal it entirely. But there’s a sharp divide between the 27 percent who want to repeal parts of the law, but not all of it — and the 26 percent who want to expand the existing law.” http://politi.co/2kLs6SI \nON THE HOMEFRONT -- “GOP lessons from the latest round of brutal town halls,” by Kyle Cheney in Blackstone, Virginia: “An overflow crowd here was eager to take on Rep. Dave Brat, the conservative Republican who just weeks earlier needled liberal protesters in his district and groused about all the women ‘in my grill’ over GOP plans to repeal and replace Obamacare. But with a plain-spoken approach -- and a format that didn’t revolve around live-fire questions from the combative crowd -- Brat offered his colleagues a potential blueprint for defusing tense constituent town halls that have bedeviled his Republican colleagues as they’ve been swarmed by protesters.” http://politi.co/2kYrhS8 ... The Richmond Times Dispatch's coverage http://bit.ly/2lL2OUE \n--@KilloughCNN: “Here’s a good example of the rowdiness/frustration at Rep. Dave Brat’s town hall tonight.

Sad!”\n--Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence): “Fox News runs segment at 6:15 about protestors organizing against Trump ... Trump tweets at 6:23” http://bit.ly/2mbc81y \n-- NOTE: Yes, some of these protests might be more astroturf than grassroots. And there’s not a clear parallel to 2009. But in 2009, Democrats dismissed the protests too. Anger and discontent tends to spiral. So Republicans should be wary -- but even moreso, they should be prepared. We’ve seen some well-prepared lawmakers -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.), Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and others. The secret to getting through a town hall unscathed -- let the protesters and upset constituents talk. It’s much better than trying to cut them off in the middle of them laying out their public frustrations.\n-- THE REALITY ON THE GROUND: It’s not just town halls -- constituents and out of state callers are bombarding many Republican congressional offices with thousands of calls. One GOP House office has increased its number of staffers and interns handling inbound calls from two to 10 people in the last month, the Republican member’s chief of staff told Playbook. He said it’s been “30 days of being bombarded” by “whatever is happening in the news cycle like Steve Bannon, Trump and tax returns, Trump did this, Trump did this.”\nTHE POLITICO/MORNING CONSULT POLL shows that 56% of people want their members of Congress to hold in-person town halls. 20% say tele town hall suffices.... 34% said Trump's long news conference last week was excellent or good, 29% said it was poor. ... 51% say members of Congress spend too little time meeting with constituents ...\n\nA message from the Lift the Cap Campaign from Better Medicare Alliance: Millions of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are denied the full value of a high-quality Medicare Advantage plan because of a technical provision known as the Benchmark Cap.

As many as 1,000 medical school graduates may be unfairly penalized because of their country of origin, medical school officials say. Massachusetts could be hit particularly hard because the state is home to some of the world’s leading teaching hospitals as well as smaller community hospitals that typically depend on a large pool of foreign medical talent.\n“The concern over Trump’s policies -- particularly his restriction on travel from seven majority Muslim countries -- has added an unusual amount of anxiety to the upcoming ‘Match Day,’’ when medical students learn which hospital has accepted them to a residency program. ‘We don’t know how programs are going to react, and it’s part of why everybody is very stressed and very on edge right now,’ said Kelly Thibert, president of the American Medical Student Association.” http://bit.ly/2l76BYK \nTHE TYPE OF HEADLINES THAT SPOOK REPUBLICANS -- ARIZONA REPUBLIC: “ CRACKDOWN LOOMS” http://bit.ly/2ml0obY … USA TODAY: “U.S. COULD DEPORT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE” http://bit.ly/2m7e1zi \n-- THE BUZZ: Republicans are really worried that the government could begin deporting people for low-level crimes, which could begin to look like mass deportation whether the White House wants to call it that or not.\nTHE CONCERN ON THE RIGHT -- “Yiannopoulos flap casts pall over CPAC,” by Eliana Johnson: “The episode encapsulated the debate that’s roiled the Republican Party over the past year, as Donald Trump and his army of nationalist-populist followers eviscerated a field of more traditional Republicans.

Can he really beat Ted Cruz?” by WaPo’s Ben Terris in El Paso: “Beto O’Rourke has long believed that the closer you get to the Mexican border, the less you fear it. So on a recent afternoon, the Democratic congressman who may challenge Ted Cruz for his U.S. Senate seat walked into Juarez for lunch. The mere name of this Mexican city conjures images of bloodthirsty cartels or seedy red-light districts — the kind of place, some have argued, against which the United States should seal itself with a big, beautiful wall. O’Rourke is strongly opposed to that plan. Among other things, it would make it harder to visit the bar he took his wife to on their first date. ... Democrats might look at O’Rourke -- a small-business owner with hipster credentials, a Gen Xer who speaks fluent Spanish and looks more like a Kennedy than the Kennedys do -- and see a candidate of thrilling national potential.” http://wapo.st/2kL0lKp \nTHE JUICE … \n-- DEPT. OF LOST AND FOUND: Sometimes, the wheels of justice turn slowly. Really slowly. Ted Stevens, the late former Alaska Republican senator, was convicted in 2008 on federal corruption charges and lost his reelection bid that November, only to see his conviction vacated the following year when Justice Department prosecutors admitted withholding information from Stevens’ defense team. In April 2009, a federal judge ordered DOJ to hold onto all the evidence that it had from “Polar Pen,” the codename for its probe into Alaska lawmakers. Stevens died in a plane crash in Aug. 2010.\nNow, more than six years after Stevens’ death, the Justice Dept. is finally ready to return some of the 631 items in the case, including letters between Stevens and Bill Allen, an oil-industry executive and Stevens’ pal who turned into the star government witness against him. There’s also material from Ben Stevens – the senator’s son – and Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska). Both men were caught up in the criminal probe but never indicted. There is some less interesting evidence, like manuals for the boiler and generator in Stevens’ house, which FBI agents seized during a July 2007 raid. The FBI seized $9,500 in $100 bills, as well.

Kelly will take time to implement because of costs and logistical challenges and that border patrol agents and immigration officers will use their expanded powers with care and discretion. Yet the official public rollout of Kelly’s directives, first disclosed in media reports over the weekend, was met with outrage from immigrant rights advocates over concerns the new policies will result in widespread abuses as authorities attempt to fulfill President Trump’s goals of tightening border control.” http://wapo.st/2lugykh \nMORE ON MCMASTER -- “The Insurgent in the White House: In picking H.R.

He could be Trump’s lost gay child. In fact, Yiannopoulos, 33, has a habit of referring to Trump, 70, as ‘Daddy.’ Trump the father and Yiannopoulos the son are both provocateurs who realize that in this day and age especially, the currency of celebrity isn’t demeaned by the outrageousness and offensiveness through which a person achieves it.
