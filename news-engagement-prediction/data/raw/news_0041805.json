He was not seriously injured. Photo: Handout. \nTwo pedestrians, including an elderly man, were injured on Wednesday in the southwest Chinese city of Chongqing when a security van veered out of control as its driver tried to avoid hitting a dog, the local news portal Cqnews.com reports. \nEven though the old man was knocked off the road into a ditch, with his leg buried under a collapsed wall, the guards in the van offered no assistance and guarded the cash until firemen arrived 15 minutes later. The elderly pedestrian was knocked over into a drainage ditch. Photo: Handout. \nThe driver said later that the dog dashed onto the road suddenly and he immediately steered the truck to the left, but the heavy vehicle lost control in the wet conditions and struck the two pedestrians. \nThe elderly man ended up under the truck in the ditch. \nRescuers were able to raise the truck and free the elderly man. The other pedestrian was treated in the ambulance. Both escaped serious injury. \nThe cash in the van was transferred without incident and the rescue operation lasted about 15 minutes. â€“ South China Morning Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T13:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:51:05.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
