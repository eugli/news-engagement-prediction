Love you!” \nShe responded, “Love you back,” and used emojis to wish a happy Valentine’s Day to the “Hapless Haters.” Here's the tweet to white nationalists @KellyannePolls just deleted, speaking of hapless and hate. pic.twitter.com/hpyP9Lhx85 \n— Aviatrixt (@Aviatrixt) February 14, 2017 \nWhen it was pointed out to her that the profile of the account showed support for “White Identity” and called itself a “Nationalist,” Conway deleted the tweet but denied being personally responsible for the message. The account profile also contained a symbol used frequently by “alt-right” adherents to identify themselves. \n“I don’t know who had access to my account,” Conway told Buzzfeed. “Let me see who tweeted that. That’s terrible.” She said that she had “obviously” never heard of the account before. \n“I denounce whoever it is. It will be immediately deleted,” she added. “Everybody makes mistakes.” \nCritics of the Trump administration have long attempted to put a spotlight on their ties to the “alt-right” movement to characterize the President as being sympathetic to the racist movement. Trump’s top aide Stephen Bannon once said that he had made the late Andrew Breitbart’s news website the “platform” for the alt-right, and the movement has not shied away from unabashedly supporting Trump. Kellyanne Conway has bristled at the accusation and denied any and all connection to the alt-right, Bannon’s quote notwithstanding.
