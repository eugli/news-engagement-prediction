Tim Kaine (D-Va.) has criticized President Donald Trump for getting “it all backwards” when it comes to U.S. foreign policy. Trump’s tendency to pick fights with America’s “strong allies” such as Mexico and Australia is “very damaging” and “embarrassing,” Hillary Clinton’s 2016 running mate said in an interview ATTN: posted online Wednesday. Citing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford’s assertion that Russia was currently America’s “principal adversary” in the world, Kaine questioned just why Trump was trying to be its “apologist” or “defense lawyer.” “He’s making our allies nervous and he’s trying to appease our adversaries,” said Kaine in the interview with ATTN: editor-in-chief Matthew Segal . “That kind of appeasement process does not work.” Check out the full interview above.
