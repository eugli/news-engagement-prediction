Here's what we're watching right now: Democrats in Congress said they received news from Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials on Thursday that they \"should expect many more arrests and removals this year.\" State lawmakers are considering making election day a paid holiday in California. Pointing out the unpopularity of Congress, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger launched an effort on Tuesday in support of overhauling redistricting rules in states across the nation. California Legislature Feb. 17, 2017, 5:07 p.m. Uber would have to allow drivers to collect tips from credit cards under a new California bill Liam Dillon Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher (D-San Diego) (Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times) \nUber drivers will be allowed to receive tips from passengers through the company's credit-card based app through new state legislation introduced Friday. \nAssembly Bill 1099 from Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez Fletcher (D-San Diego) would force companies, such as Uber, that accept payments with credit cards to allow users of the service to tip workers with credit cards as well. Currently, Uber only allows its drivers to receive tips in cash . \n\"To only accept tips by cash is tough on the driver,\" Gonzalez Fletcher said in an interview. \nThe legislation wouldn't only apply to the ride-hailing industry — Uber's rival Lyft already allows drivers to receive tips through its app — but also nail salons, spas and all other businesses accepting credit card payments. \nGonzalez Fletcher said her measure was the first step in what could ultimately be a broader bill that would allow workers in the so-called gig economy to organize. Negotiations between the ride-hailing industry and labor unions were ongoing, she said, and she hoped an agreement could be reached on issues such as workers compensation, unemployment and Social Security benefits. \nLast year, Gonzalez Fletcher pulled a bill that would have allowed gig economy workers to collectively bargain, saying the matter needed more study . She still plans to advance collective bargaining rules to Gov. Jerry Brown prior to his leaving office in 2018. \n\"It’s one hurdle on a time,\" she said.
