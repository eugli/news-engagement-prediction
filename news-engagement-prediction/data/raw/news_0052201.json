Bush at Judson University in 2011, back to Ulysses S. Grant in the late 1870s. \nAccording to information from Elgin historian Mike Alft, Grant was the only POTUS... (Mike Danahey) \nThe notes on the back said it was put up at Washington School in Elgin on January 26, 1899. Thelen went online in hopes of finding the school in question, which happened to be Washington Elementary, one of the oldest schools in School District U46. Rather than keeping it for himself, he mailed the portrait, the Native American poster and a letter detailing his discovery to the school last fall. He kept the frame, though. \n\"I only hope that someone would be interested in the original picture with its inscription, as it may have some historic value to the school...or not!\" Thelen wrote to the school. \"If not, perhaps you can find a charitable outlet for it, but I return it in hope it may have some interest there. Who knows how it got to Colorado!\" \nAs previously mentioned, Thelen also found the name of the person who had given the portrait of the school, a Laura Bunker. Judy Van Dusen, a researcher for the Elgin Historical Society, said Bunker is an old Elgin surname that likely dates back to then-owners of a local funeral home. \n\"We're still in the process of that research,\" added Brandes. \"We believe that Bunker gave it to the school as part of her eighth grade graduation.\" \nHowever, the return of the portrait has left vital questions unanswered. How long it has been away from the school is one, said Brandes. The principal said the school's most senior teacher doesn't recall it being there when she started 30 years ago. \nHow it made it to Colorado is another, Van Dusen said. Bunker passed away in California in the 1950s. Her research suggests one of Bunker's granddaughters may have lived in Colorado at one point. \n\"My theory is the picture was taken down from the school, given back to the family, it ended up with the granddaughter in Colorado, they didn't want it anymore, and it wound up in a resale shop,\" she said. \nA potential great-granddaughter of Bunker may live in the Chicago area, Van Dusen added. She has reached out to the potential family member but has not heard back. \n\"Hopefully this woman will write me back,\" said Van Dusen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:06:58.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
