The modern gift is glass or a watch, thought by many to be a symbol of the time you've had — and plan to have — together. \nMany spouses feel challenged when it comes to selecting either a traditional or modern gift on this special occasion. Handing over a Timex may seem less than romantic, no matter how pretty it is. Here are a few ideas to help you conform to tradition — even modern tradition — in a loving way. Traditional Gift Suggestions \nCrystal has a reputation for being delicate and requiring careful handling. That's true in some cases, not so true in others. Crystal can be a dazzling reminder of the love you've shared for 15 years, sturdy enough to last another 15. For example, a crystal paperweight is more solid than delicate. The same can be said for a crystal ball — and just think of the fun you can have with that association. \ncontinue reading below our video 11th-15th Wedding Anniversary Gift Suggestions More delicate crystal ideas include stemware, bells, decanters and vases. You might even fill that vase with flowers. Contemporary/Modern Gift Suggestions \nA watch is a timepiece and timepieces come in all shapes and sizes, from those that hang on a wall to those that sit on a table or desk or secure snugly around the wrist. A timepiece can even dangle from your spouse's neck on a lovely gold or silver chain. Think of the time you've spent together and the many years ahead you want to spend together and you'll understand the significance of timepieces in any form for this anniversary. A practical watch that he'll love and really use can be perfect, too, such as one that's designed for wearing during water sports, golf or another hobby. The 15th Anniversary Gemstone \nIt's not all about crystal and timepieces. Three gemstones are commonly connected with 15th wedding anniversary tradition: the ruby, garnet and alexandrite. So if crystal and clocks don't appeal to you, consider jewelry. In keeping with rubies and garnets, the official color of a 15th anniversary is red, although the alexandrite is known for changing color. They only turn red at night, but that can be fun, too. The 15th Anniversary Flower \nThe traditional flower for this anniversary is the rose — preferably a red one. In the language of flowers, roses represent passion, love and perfection. Ways to Celebrate Your 15th Anniversary \nNow that you've got the gifts figured out, toast each other — with red wine, of course — in that new crystal stemware. Or cover all your bases and purchase a crystal clock together. Fill a crystal box with a love poem or note, a small romantic book, love coupons or a picture of the two of you. You might want to put together a road map describing a trip the two might take together to place that's known for its watches and crystal. Switzerland and Italy come to mind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T14:44:11.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
