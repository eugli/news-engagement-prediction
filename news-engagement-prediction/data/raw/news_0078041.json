We have a massive end of the season to come.\" \nCaretaker     getting the manager's job on a permanent basis by overseeing a display far more in keeping with last year's high-energy performances with quick transitions from defence to Vardy. \n\"Before the game we spoke with Shakes [caretaker manager Craig Shakespeare] and he asked us what we thought were the best actions to take,\" added Vardy. \"We thought it was to press higher and win the ball higher up. We did that and hurt them.\" 'Fire in the belly' Craig Shakespeare has previously had a stint as West Brom caretaker manager \nShakespeare, who has said he would like the Leicester job, was full of praise for his players, adding that he had never questioned their application or commitment. \n\"I could see in their eyes that they were up to the fight in the warm-up,\" said the 53-year-old. \"You could tell from the word go there was intensity and passion. \n\"The professionalism of the players has never been questioned by me. Having taken training with them, I know the criticism has hurt and perhaps there was a little more fire in the belly because of that. \n\"They know they are guilty of under-performing but this is only one result and we must build on that.\" 'Uncomfortable watching' Some Leicester fans made their feelings known about the sacking of Claudio Ranieri - this banner using a much-quoted line used by the Italian last season \nFormer Leicester midfielder Robbie Savage was the summariser for BBC Radio 5 live at the King Power Stadium on Monday. \n\"Well I just can't believe what I'm seeing. It's completely different. They've got an extra yard, they've got extra desire. \n\"And it's actually quite uncomfortable watching this in a strange way. \n\"They have been playing like champions and the only difference is the manager is not here. And that doesn't seem to sit that well. \n\"How many of these Leicester players in the last few months have been able to go home after a match, look in the mirror and say 'I did everything I could have done during that game?' \n\"Tonight, they all can.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:20:54.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
