He admitted that he has been struggling with the delay in burying his friend, whose funeral cannot go ahead until a coroner gets toxicology results. George passed away on Christmas Day last year. \"We've not had closure,\" Andrew told the Daily Mirror at the Brit Awards on Wednesday. \"It's difficult for me. It's difficult for everyone. It's a limbo period and we need to be able to move on.\" \nEarlier that night, Andrew had taken to the stage with his and George's former back-up singers, Helen 'Pepsi' DeMacque and Shirlie Holliman, to pay tribute to the Careless Whisper singer . Andrew fondly recalled how he and George formed their first band after becoming friends at school. \"We were two boys who happened to share a mutual sense of humour… and a shared sense we understood,\" he said. \"We messed around making jingles in George's bedroom… We larked around and laughed a lot. We were the best of friends. Thus we formed our first band. It sparked and spluttered leaving two that became three.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T14:05:13.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
