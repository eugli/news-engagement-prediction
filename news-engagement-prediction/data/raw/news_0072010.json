Here are eight seminal moments that made Gosling the (reluctant) movie star he is today: 1993: The All New Mickey-Mouse Club \nA 12-year-old, London, Ont.-born Ryan Gosling is cast in The All New Disney Mickey Mouse Club . The series, filmed in Florida, is short-lived but becomes famous in hindsight for churning out some of the biggest entertainers of a generation: Gosling, Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Keri Russell. \nIn a segment for CBC News, a pre-teen Gosling gushes about the talent of the other child performers on the show and attributes his inclusion to \"luck\" — the beginnings of a modest public persona he would exhibit for years to come. Ryan Gosling | Disney Mouseketeer 1:19 1999: Young Hercules \nA tall and skinny 17-year-old Gosling might not have the brawn of the son of Zeus, but in this teen series, he gets to flex his leading-man muscles. Award-winning material it is not, but the series is highly publicized due to the 1990s craze for low-budget superhero fare ( Xena: The Warrior Princess , Hercules ). The series' remarkably ambitious filming schedule is now studied in film production courses: four episodes were filmed at a time instead of one — a lesson in discipline and endurance for young Gosling. 2004: The Notebook \n\"If you're a bird, I'm a bird.\" Gosling flaps his arms like a bird for co-star Rachel McAdams in The Notebook and begets a flock of devoted female fans along the way. The box office success of the film based on the Nicholas Sparks novel is also helped by the explosive chemistry of Gosling and fellow Canadian McAdams. Ryan Gosling on Canadian roots: 'I always felt like I had something to go back to' \nWhile they allegedly fought on set, the two became an on-again, off-again couple that fans obsessed over for years. Gosling had since called McAdams \"one of the great loves of his life.\" But one thing he was clearly not as in love with was the press's obsession with his relationships. 2006-2007: Half Nelson, Lars and the Real Girl \nHow do you follow your newly minted status as Hollywood's young male romantic lead? If you're Ryan Gosling, you do it by choosing roles in little-publicized indie movies, where you play a drug-addicted high school teacher and an overweight guy in love with a mail-order sex doll. Half Nelson and Lars and the Real Girl are not the stuff Gosling's fans likely dreamed of, but they reminded the critics he could act. Half Nelson gets Gosling his first Oscar nomination. 2008-2010: Hiatus and Hey Girl! \nParadoxically, Gosling's popularity is growing even in the years he's not working. His hiatus seems to be part circumstance — he lost a part in The Lovely Bones because he gained too much weight for director Peter Jackson's liking — and part desire to rest and reassess his career. But Gosling's fans are busy perpetuating his image as a modern, intellectual woman's sex symbol.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:26:15.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
