Thomas Jefferson, the third US president, complained bitterly about what is now called fake news , a subject close to Trump’s heart. “Nothing can now be believed which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious by being put into that polluted vehicle,” Jefferson wrote in 1807. \nLuckily for him, perhaps, Jefferson did not have to break bread with journalists in front of television cameras. The WHCA was not formed until 1914 and its annual dinners began in 1921. But age-old tensions were not dispelled. \nTrump press ban: BBC, CNN and Guardian denied access to briefing Read more \nIn 1913, Woodrow Wilson had threatened to scrap presidential news conferences after complaining that “certain evening newspapers” had quoted remarks he considered off the record. \nThe founders of the WHCA issued a binding code of conduct for reporters to reassure Wilson and persuade him to keep the White House doors open. Wilson relented but, like Trump, he heartily disliked press conferences, which he thought a tedious waste of time. He stopped holding them altogether in 1915. \nAlthough notorious for their funny and satirical speeches, the dinners often carry a sharp political edge. Richard Nixon, who famously blamed hostile hacks after a 1962 election defeat in California, saying “you won’t have Nixon to kick around any more”, and skipped the event entirely, back in 1972. \nDuring the Watergate scandal that brought him down, a besieged Nixon told advisers: “The press is your enemy. Enemies. Understand that? … Because they’re trying to stick the knife right in our groin.” His comments find an echo , decades later, in Trump’s repeated description of the media as the “enemy of the people”. \nRonald Reagan did not attend the dinner in 1981, after being badly wounded in a roadside assassination attempt. But he gamely phoned in from Camp David instead. “If I could give you just one little bit of advice, when somebody tells you to get in a car quick, do it,” he joked. Reagan, known as the Great Communicator, added: “Well, I’m looking forward to the next news conference. I have so many questions to ask you all.” \nBill Clinton always liked a party and attended all eight dinners during his two terms as president. He usually kept his cool. \nIn 2000, he said he forgave the jokes made at his expense by the comedian Jay Leno: “Me and Leno, we give hope to grey-haired, chunky baby-boomers everywhere.” But Clinton, too, railed against the media at other times, once publicly condemning “purveyors of hatred and division” on the public airwaves. \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nGeorge W Bush, himself a noted practical joker, got it in the neck from Stephen Colbert in 2006, who ruthlessly parodied his “no fact zone” philosophy of government, especially in Iraq. He likened him to Sylvester Stallone’s fictional boxer Rocky Balboa who everyone wants to punch in the face. Bush took it on the chin. \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nSome of the harshest treatment in recent years was dealt out by comedian Seth Meyers, who went after Trump at the 2011 dinner. Meyers likened Trump’s appearance to an “old rusty bird cage”, saying the billionaire preferred Fox News because he wore a fox on his head. He predicted Trump “running as a Republican” in 2016 would be more like “running as a joke”. Funny, but wrong. \nThe other person to needle Trump in 2011 was, of course, Barack Obama, who used the WHCA platform year in, year out, to display a masterly mix of self-deprecation and shrewd mockery of the media. \nAt the height of the so-called birther controversy – Trump’s questioning over whether or not the president had been born in the US – Obama noted that Trump was among the dinner attendees , adding: “I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate issue to rest, and that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter, like did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?” \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nThe WHCA dinner, known inside the Beltway as the Nerd Prom, has been criticised in recent years for encouraging unseemly cosiness between independent media and those in power, and news organisations such as the New York Times no longer attend. Guardian US made it clear last month that it would not be attending this year’s dinner. \nProblems with over-friendliness seem unlikely to recur in the Trump era. With Trump finding the after-dinner jokes hard to swallow and taking himself off the menu in April, there are now suggestions his spot should be taken by the actor Alec Baldwin , the president’s merciless, orange-faced late-night TV impersonator.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:30:26.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
