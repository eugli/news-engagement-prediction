The Examining Committee mentioned that the story was lady-oriented and so they could not certify it. The letter from the CBFC read as, “The story is lady-oriented, their fantasy above life. There are contentious sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society.” \nThis decision came as a shock as the same film had received a lot of praise and awards at various film festivals. One such award that Lipstick Under My Burkha won was the Oxfam Best Film on Gender Equality Award at the Mumbai Film Festival. And the presenter of the award, Oxfam India (a leading NGO) has come out in support of the film. The CEO of Oxfam India, Nisha Agrawal mentioned, “It is a film that ferociously challenges the gender based social norms and there is a need to promote and support lady-oriented films that break stereotypes about women and girls in India. Oxfam India is proud to have awarded Lipstick Under My Burkha and supports the makers of this progressive film.” ALSO READ – Shocking! CBFC rejects certification of Prakash Jha’s next as it challenges patriarchy? \nThe award category under which Lipstick Under My Burkha won, focused on films that challenge gender-based social norms which lead to gender inequality and hence to the global pandemic of violence against women. And in an day and age when people are talking about women empowerment and gender equality, this decision by the CBFC comes as a huge surprise. The makers feel that the fact that the film challenges patriarchy has not go down well with the committee and so, they decided not to certify the film. The makers will now appeal at the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) and try to get their film certified. \nThe film, directed by Alankrita Shrivastava and produced by Prakash Jha , was conferred with the Oxfam award for creatively and effectively talking about topics of marital rape, religious orthodoxy, sexuality of older women and most importantly women taking ownership of their own bodies. Jury members that conferred this award included Rahul Bose, Shonali Bose and Kunal Kapoor .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:22:36.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
