In Close Encounters , visiting aliens telepathically transmitted visions to a handful of Earthlings. showing them the mountain where contact would be made. It’s possible that whomever drew the giant beast in the red clouds (presumably Will) has been seeing visions of this terror, similar to Spielberg's movie. However, given the Ghostbusters costumes and the movie's release date (and The Montauk Project’s history of mental manifestations), it’s also possible that Will imagining a multi-legged creature in his head manifested the monster in real life. In 1984, Will Byers would have seen Ray Stanz accidentally choose the form of Gozer’s destructor by thinking of a marshmallow man. Considering that Eleven and the Demogorgon were entities with connected abilities but opposite goals, my money is on manifestation of inner evil. Netflix And there's the creature from the drawing, towering in silhouette like something from Stephen King’s The Mist -- adding to the show's many references of the horror titan . The Mist first appeared as a short story in the Dark Forces anthology in 1980, then reworked as part of King's 1985 Skeleton Crew anthology. In King's expanded Dark Tower lore, an experimental military operation called The Arrowhead Project is responsible for tearing open a dimensional portal that allows for monsters to creep through. Not too far off from the goings on in Hawkins. Worth noting: the official Stranger Things account tweeted this weather forecast before the teaser aired on Sunday (hence why Sunday’s temperatures are -11 and 11): — Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) February 3, 2017 This red cloud symbolism is most likely referring to \"The Storm,\" the title of the fifth episode of Season 2 . What \"The Storm\" represents is going to be what we debate for the next few months, because official Stranger Things insists it’s a selling point to the second season: @Da7e ˙ƃuᴉɯoɔ sᴉ ɯɹoʇs ∀ — Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) February 6, 2017 “The Storm” is something else that could be pulled from The Mist . In King's short story, it’s an electrical storm that causes the mist to descend over the town. It an abandoned prologue scene from The Mist movie from 2007 (made with King's approval), a government project called \"Project Arrowhead\" caused both the storm and the mist by attempting to open a portal into another dimension. King’s The Dark Tower series corroborates this logic when monsters resembling those from The Mist emerge from \"the todash space\" or the space between dimensions. It could be any or none of those things, but the repeated use of a “Storm” is encouraging. Netflix And the coup de gras on a short teaser: This season takes place over, and drops in real life in the vicinity of, Halloween. Only 267 more days of speculation.
