In fact, if anything, he was positioned on the ideal side for a natural left-footer. \nBut after going through his usual goalkicking routine, Daniher pulled a massive surprise when he unleashed a set-shot kick on his non-preferred right boot. \nWhile the kick wasn’t as graceful as a Nathan Buckley right boot, it ultimately produced the desired result, with the ball sailing through the goals just above mid-post height. \nIt left the hundreds of onlookers at the club’s Tullamarine headquarters in shock.

He doesn’t take long to slot in and look natural again.” \nIt looks as a big season for the 22-year-old, who was on Wednesday announced as member of the club’s new-look leadership group led by Dyson Heppell. \nDaniher carried a heavy load for the Bombers in 2016, finishing with 43 goals for the season — 23 more than the next best fall in Mitch Brown. According to Champion Data , he has been targeted inside forward 50 on 429 occasions since 2013 — 252 more than any other player. \nDespite the responsibility for such a young player, his kicking for goal has constantly been scrutinised, particularly for his high ball drop and mid-kick rotation. \nHis career goalkicking accuracy of 46.4 per cent is rated below average, with the AFL average sitting around 55.6 per cent. \nIn an attempt to address his inaccuracy, Daniher tried several different goalkicking techniques last year, including the Steve Johnson-style approach where he turned 90 degrees and snapped for goal, even though he was directly in front at stages. \nWhether the right-foot kick was deliberate or simply an attempt to protect his left knee, it produced six points for his side. \nAnd there could be many more goals off his right boot to come this year.
