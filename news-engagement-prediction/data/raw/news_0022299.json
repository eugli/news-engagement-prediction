It's geared both for people who are looking for help and those who are offering it. \nThe new tool, Community Help, is an addition to the Safety Check feature that lets people mark themselves as safe in emergencies. \nNow, Safety Check can be used for organizing a community response offline. People can mark themselves as safe on Facebook and then visit the emergency's Community Help page to see what people need or offer things like housing, food or transportation. \nSafety Check is activated automatically when enough people on Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) in the same geographic area talk about an emergency. \nThe company is first alerted to emergencies through third-party crisis reporting organizations. Facebook then tracks the conversation around the emergency in the location where it happened. If enough people post about it, Safety Check is activated, and people in the area are alerted to mark themselves as safe. \nFollowing the 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, people used social media to offer housing to strangers . More than 4 million people marked themselves safe in Paris on Facebook, according to the company. \nRelated: Uber eyes Facebook data to help you befriend riders \nCommunity Help will feature about 10 different aid categories, including food, supplies, shelter and transportation. \nLet's say Mary marked herself as safe during a flood, but needs a place to stay temporarily. She can visit the flood's Community Help page through Safety Check, and tap \"shelter\" to find a place to stay. She might see a post from John offering an extra room. If they have any mutual friends in common, they'll appear under John's post. Mary can message John via Facebook, or comment on his post, to ask for help. \nA map at the top of each category plots where posts are shared, so people can find what's closest to them. \nFacebook won't vet the posts, meaning people will often be placing trust in those they don't know. However, the company will prevent users under 18 and those with brand new accounts from requesting or offering help. People can report posts they feel could be threatening or unsafe. \nThe new tool also makes it easy for people to mark whether they've received help, or if it's no longer available. \nCommunity Help is rolling out on Wednesday in a handful of countries including the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India. Facebook says it plans to expand to more countries in the future.
