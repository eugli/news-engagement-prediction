In the course of interviewing to promote that film, he made some comments on the recent election of President Donald Trump that is a refreshing departure from the hysterics coming out of Hollywood since the election. \nMcConaughey starts by answering the interviewer’s question about the lead character in the film, flabby, hard-drinking Kenny Wells. Is this the story of a member of “redneck America sticking one up to the snotty East Coast elites?,” the reporter asks. \n“Stickin’ it to the man, for sure,” McConaughey answered. “I mean, it’s an underdog story. This is the guy that nobody bets on. This is like millions of people, if not billions, who get out of bed everyday, and don’t have a ticket to the American Dream. That are going to have to hustle their way in the backdoor, the sidedoor, or come down the chimney, and be an entrepreneur, and make it their own way—by hook or by crook.” \nAnd what of your Hollywood peers, the reporter continues, who hate the new president? “Do you think it’s time maybe Hollywood and the culture elite in America gave this guy a break?,” he asks. \n“Well, they don’t have a choice now. He’s our president. And, it’s very dynamic and as divisive of an Inauguration and time as we’ve had. At the same time, it’s time for us to embrace and shake hands with this fact. And be constructive with him over the next four years. \nSo anyone, even those who may strongly disagree with his principles or things he’s said and done — and that’s another thing, we’ll see what he does compares to what he has said — no matter how much you even disagreed along the way, it’s time to think about how constructive can you be. \n‘Cause he’s our president for the next four years, at least, the President of the United States.” \nThe reaction emanating from Hollywood to the Trump election and inauguration has been nothing short of dramatic. Exhortations of racism, misogyny and xenophobia have been reiterated in impassioned speeches from behind podiums by celebrities gripping statuettes dressed in designer gowns and sporting professionally coiffed hairstyles. \nMatthew McConaughey’s thoughtful, poised and rational approach to his nation’s new leadership is something his acting cohort in Los Angeles would do well to emulate. \nWatch the full interview below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:42:51.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
