Paul is a sturdy, stoic man who loves his wife and golf, and hugs his grandkids more than he's ever hugged his kids. An economics professor, Paul is great at investing, but not great at feelings. \nThis marks Walsh's latest small-screen role following recent gigs on Designated Survivor and Longmire. He's repped by Gersh, McGowan Management and Stone Genow. \nErin Cardillo and Richard Keith ( Significant Mother ) will pen the script for the Warner Bros. Television pilot and exec produce alongside Lawrence and his Doozer topper, Jeff Ingold. \nKeep track of the latest news and castings at THR.com/PilotSeason and bookmark THR 's handy guide .
