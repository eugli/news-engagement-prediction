BreezoMeter \nAir pollution is an invisible killer. In London, levels surpassed those of Beijing for the first time ever in January, causing Mayor Sadiq Khan to issue a \"black\" alert over the \"shameful state\" of the city's \"toxic air.\" \nNow, a new interactive map released by air pollution data provider BreezoMeter allows Londoners to see the state of their city's air in real-time with street-level accuracy. \nThe map — which monitors more than 25,000 cities worldwide — is one of the most comprehensive of its kind and tracks governmental sensors, satellites, weather patterns, hyperlocal transportation dynamics and other environmental sources to provide air pollution data. \nEvery location is updated on an hourly basis and given an air quality rating out of 100, with 100 being the highest air quality and 0 being the worst. \nIf you live in a city, BreezoMeter's tool can be a sobering reminder of the filthy air you breathe really is. \nCentral London: Air pollution levels in the capital are currently a cause for concern. BreezoMeter recommends you stay indoors if possible. Breezometer \nCentral London's low air quality resulted in a score of 38. \nThe map tells users when they should avoid outdoor workouts and also how safe it is for children to go outside. Parents in The City of London are advised to \"think about their children's health\" and keep them indoors. \nIn a press release, CTO of BreezoMeter Emil Fisher said: \"To day’s traditional air pollution monitoring methods include only annual traffic data, which doesn’t reflect the day-to-day changes residents see and breathe on their local streets.\" \n\"BreezoMeter’s newest algorithm serves as a massive research and development breakthrough, bringing air pollution data accuracy to a new and precise level, monitored worldwide.” \nIn New Delhi, a city that spends much of its time blanketed in a thick sheet of smog , the dire air quality means those in the city are advised to stay indoors with the windows closed and not perform any strenuous activity or exercise in outdoor places. \nNew Delhi, India: Parents are discouraged from allowing their children outside and warned that respiratory problems may be inflamed by the air quality. Breezometer \nAccording to the company's data, New Delhi isn't the city with the worst air quality. That title goes to the South American city of Puebla and the surrounding region which was given a damning score of 0. \nBreezoMeter says people in the city should avoid being outdoors entirely, and tells those with respiratory problems that \"this is the kind of poor air quality that the doctors warned you about.\" \nBreezoMeter's data is currently integrated by a number of brands including Forbes, Accuweather, Cisco, and Dyson. \nThe Israeli company was recognised by former US President Barack Obama for its innovation and contribution to improving the human condition. It was also shortlisted for an award from the UN Economic Commission for Europe . \n\nYou can see the pollution levels in your city using the map here . \nPuebla, Mexico: This South American city currently has one of the lowest qualities of air.
