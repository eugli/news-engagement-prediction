The move, however, drew flak from civil society. \nThe government has asked people to “cook only seven non-vegetarian and seven vegetarian dishes in marriages with two stalls of sweets or fruits.” Kashmir has more than 12 dishes in Wazwan (traditional cuisine), and Jammu is known for an array of vegetarian dishes. \nThe bride’s family may invite a maximum of 500 guests, while the guest list for the groom’s family should stop at 400. \nFor functions like the ring ceremony of son, daughter and other small events, the number of guests can top 100, according to the government order, to be implemented by Deputy Commissioners. \n“Big gatherings often block roads due to wrong parking and create [traffic] jams,” the order says. \nUsing less \nMinister for Food, Civil Supplies, and Consumer Affairs, Choudhary Zulfkar Ali said, “The order was issued after the department received complaints and representations, both from civil as well as social organisations regarding injudicious use of essential commodities and exuberant expenditures made in public and private functions.” \nThe government has also directed that leftover, uncooked or surplus food should be provided to the needy. \n“There shall be a complete ban on use of big generator set, high pitch sound amplifiers, loudspeakers, decks, profuse lighting, and bursting of crackers in social as well as government functions,” Mr. Ali explained. \nNo dry fruit boxes \nThe government has also banned the popular practice of sending dry fruit boxes to guests along with the wedding invitations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:16:03.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
