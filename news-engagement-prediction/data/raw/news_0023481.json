REUTERS/Lucas Jackson \nTwitter Inc ( TWTR.N ) reported its slowest quarterly revenue growth since going public, as the company continues to grapple with intense competition from newer services such as Snap Inc's Snapchat and Facebook's ( FB.O ) Instagram. \nTwitter's net loss widened to $167.1 million, or 23 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $90.24 million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. \nRestructuring charges in the latest quarter ballooned to $101.2 million from $12.9 million a year earlier. \nRevenue rose 1 percent to $717 million. \nTwitter was abuzz with takeover chatter last year involving big names such as Salesforce.com Inc ( CRM.N ) and Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ). The rumors died down due to the lack of concrete offers. \nTwitter said in October it would cut 9 percent of its global workforce as part of a broader restructuring. \n(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal and Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) Next In Technology News Alibaba's Ant Financial to raise as much as $3 billion in debt: source \nHONG KONG China's most valuable online finance company, Ant Financial, is in early stage talks with banks to raise between $2 billion to $3 billion in debt to fund acquisitions and foreign investments, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T14:23:43.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
