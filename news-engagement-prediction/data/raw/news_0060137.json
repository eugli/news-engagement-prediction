The updated line includes a touchscreen option and way better battery life. Today, we got pricing details . The LG Gram 13Z970 will cost $999.99 for non-touch, or $1,099 for touch. The LG Gram 14Z970 is priced at $1,499 when it includes an Intel Core i7 processor and $1,199 for the version with the Intel Core i5. The largest notebook in the line, the Gram 15Z970, goes up to $1,699 with the inclusion of an Intel Core i7 processor with 16GB of memory and 512GB of storage with a touchscreen. All models are available now from the usual nationwide retailers, like Amazon, Costco, and B&H.\nLG initially said its Gram 14 notebook could last up to 23 hours on a single charge, but it seems like the company adjusted that figure in its most recent press release. It now claims its Gram 14 can last for up to 14.5 hours on a single charge. As we pointed out at CES , that original figure was based off a 10-year-old battery benchmark test. Even still, 17 hours of life would be impressive for LG considering its last Gram release barely lasted more than five hours.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:23:39.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
