By Peggy Truong Universal Pictures Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Christian Grey’s Seattle penthouse is back online, y’all. Universal has revived ChristianGreysApartment.com just in time for the release of Fifty Shades Darker , out Friday. At first glance, it looks like a lot has changed at Escala. I’d like to believe that Christian got so upset over his five-day break from Ana that he decided to do a full makeover to his home. Even the staircase to the second floor looks a little different, and that awful blue carpet in the living room is gone . Enough with that, though. Here’s what I discovered while \"walking\" through Christian's apartment: 1. Part of the elevator is lined with a red rug. It’s nice to know that elevator sex can be comfy after all. Also what a nice umbrella rack (for all the Seattle rain). ChristianGreysApartment.com 2. He’s got a lot of fancy art pieces . This is not news but the real takeaway is the labels that pop up when you breeze by one. ChristianGreysApartment.com There’s a dirty joke here somewhere. ChristianGreysApartment.com 3. The floors are really shiny. What is that, Italian marble? ChristianGreysApartment.com 4. His wine cellar is L-I-T. No really. Look at how the pretty bottles glow. ChristianGreysApartment.com 5. His office and library (containing the ~*pool table*~, wink wink nudge nudge) are conveniently located behind the wine cellar. Because nothing says let’s get to work (or play) like a crisp bottle of Pinot Grigio. Seriously though, the pool table inside the library is incredible. Says Jamie Dornan in a fun clip I opened (this is a thing) while perusing the apartment, “If I had huge sums of money, I would want that room in my house. It’s a proper room where you’d want to have a nice glass of single malt. It’s a pretty cool room.” Great, save a glass for me. ChristianGreysApartment.com Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 6. Christian likes organizing books by color and collection. Great work, Mr. Grey. You would’ve made a fine librarian. ChristianGreysApartment.com 7. It’s Sunday. That, or he needs to recycle this old paper. ChristianGreysApartment.com 8. A folder on Esclava Salon, which he owns with Elena, is part of Christian's living room decor. Don't tell Ana. Also, why haven't those candles ever been used? Isn't it a bit weird to display candles out in the open and never use them? Ugh, and I bet they cost $125 per candle and are from France. ChristianGreysApartment.com Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 9. Mrs. Jones keeps a spotless kitchen. Would you expect anything less from that incredible woman? Also, see that dot in the middle? When you click on it, you are blessed with Ana's recipe for the pancakes she whipped up in Fifty Shades of Grey .

First impressions are not great though: Christian’s green sheets have got to go. I picture him as someone who likes burgundy sheets or something of that nature. ChristianGreysApartment.com Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 11. I’m also not allowed inside Ana’s closet, either . It looks nicer than any designer store I’ve ever stepped in. Well done, Christian. And well done nice lady who helped choose Ana’s wardrobe. (I’m sorry to forget your name, but you don’t even have a line in the book, my dear). ChristianGreysApartment.com 12. The Red Room is nowhere to be found. That’s because it won’t (virtually) open until Friday, the same day as the film, and I’ll need to search all the rooms to gather five keys to unlock the door. I’ve collected two keys so far so pardon my sudden exit, Ana and Christian, I have some work to do.
