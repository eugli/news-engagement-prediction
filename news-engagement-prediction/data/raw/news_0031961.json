Indiana lost 63-75.   13 CONNECT COMMENT   – This was Tom Crean like you’ve never seen him. Unplugged, you could call Crean after Indiana’s 75-63 loss to Michigan on Sunday. Almost no energy at all. Exhausted. Drained. Tired – and not just tired after his team’s fifth loss in six games. \nTired of his team . \nThis was Tom Crean trying his best not to shred several of his players by name, though he did single out the largest contingent of his underachieving starting five. \n  said when asked why the Hoosiers (15-11) have fallen off a cliff – they’ve lost five of seven – since OG Anunoby’s season-ending knee injury Jan. 18. “We don't   have to play when our shots aren't going. ... That's got to change.” \nImmaturity was one theme of Crean’s postgame commentary. Another was dismay, almost disbelief that his team – his veteran backcourt – is repeating its mistakes even now, 26 games into the season. \nThe season’s over, by the way. Barring the clichéd “unlikely run in the Big Ten Tournament,” the Hoosiers are going to miss the NCAA tournament in a season that began with wins over then-No. 3 Kansas and then-No. 3 North Carolina. \nThe season’s over, and Crean is starting to snipe. He lobbed a shot at his Sunday opponent to begin his news conference, opening with two sentences about his team’s poor shooting (4-for-19 on 3-pointers) before volunteering this:   \n“I'm not sure it was the Michigan defense,” Crean said. “Maybe it was. I'm sure they'll credit themselves for it.” \nAnd he was off. Before Crean was finished, he was lobbing even more pointed barbs at his guards, making it crystal clear that they aren’t playing smart enough or providing any leadership. He named no names, not even uttering the words “James” or “Blackmon” when asked a specific question about the junior guard, but offered the following nuggets about guard play on a team starting three juniors there: James Blackmon Jr. (six points Sunday), Robert Johnson (five points) and Josh Newkirk (11). \n“We get it (inside),” he said, “and we stand like we've never played basketball before rather than cut.” \n“It’s just remedial nonsense,” he was saying another time, again referring to his backcourt’s refusal to make a cut after passing the ball. \n“… and some of that doesn't make a bit of sense,” Crean said another time, perhaps about the same topic, perhaps about his backcourt's insistence on leaving good shooters open to rotate to another UM player. \n“At some point in time the window's got to crack and we're going to have a little bit real leadership during the game,” Crean said. “And at some point in time we're going to communicate.” \nAh, so that’s interesting. About the word communicate … Remember how Crean was mocked two weeks ago for having assistants hold up signs giving, shall we say, remedial basketball instruction? One such sign said: “Call out screens.” \nCrean brought up that topic on Sunday – “I know a lot of you have fun with those signs,” he said – before saying he’d been using them because his team simply doesn’t communicate enough.
