Instead, the Duchess of Cambridge will visit Royal Air Force cadets at a base in Cambridgeshire, England. Kensington Palace , the official London residence of Prince William, Kate Middleton, and Prince Harry, announced the news this week. And while no word has been released as to why the Duke of Cambridge will not be joining his wife, it is fairly obvious why Middleton would prioritize this visit herself. For roughly a year, the Duchess has been serving as the Royal Patron and Honorary Air Commandant of the Air Cadet Organisation. She took over this role after Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, her grandfather-in-law and the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, stepped down. In the recent past, both Kate Middleton and Prince William have begun to take on more and more patronships as the Queen and Prince Philip have continued to age. This is part of a larger shift in how the Duke and Duchess spend their time. This year, they will also make London their primary residence in order to take on more royal responsibilities . But since Cambridgeshire is only about an hour-and-a-half drive south from Anmer Hall , the country house that the Duke and Duchess call home, she should be able to make it back in time for Valentine’s Day dinner if need be. If not, at least the royal couple has a date night on the horizon. On February 12, both Kate Middleton and Prince William are expected to attend the BAFTA Film Awards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T17:49:36.251+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
