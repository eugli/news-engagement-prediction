Partopour, an Iranian studying in the US, is greeted by friends after clearing customs on a student visa in Boston Credit: Reuters Raf Sanchez , Jerusalem  40am \nA t airports across the US there were emotional scenes as travelers from the seven predominantly Muslim countries named in President Donald Trump's executive immigration order arrived to be greeted by loved ones. \nSome landed unsure of whether the temporary suspension of the ban meant they would be allowed to enter the US, or if it had been reinstated while they were in the air. \nHere are some of those who have been allowed back in since a judge in Seattle temporarily suspended the travel ban on Friday night. The Iranian engineer \nNazanin Zinouri landed at Logan International Airport in Boston on Sunday. \nAn Iranian industrial engineer with a PhD from from Clemson University, she has worked for a technology company in South Carolina for seven years, and has a US work visa. \nShe also has a house in Greenville, South Carolina, a six-month-old puppy there called Baxter, and a car which she had left at the airport when she went on holiday to Iran for three weeks on Jan 20, the day of President Trump's inauguration. \nWhen Mr Trump signed the executive order on Jan 27 she got on the next plane back to the US but was removed from the flight in Dubai and sent back to Iran. \nWhen the order was suspended she got on another flight via Frankfurt unsure if she would be allowed back in when it landed in Boston. \nShe said: \"I still can't believe this actually happened. I didn't see this coming any time soon, so this is definitely beyond whatever I could imagine.\" Nazanin Zinouri Credit: AP \nS outh Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the fact she was allowed back in was \"Good news!\" \nHe added: \"I know she has lots of friends and co-workers who can't wait to see her. I'm happy she's almost home.\" Good news! I know she has lots of friends and co-workers who can't wait to see her.

We live here. My work and everything is in the US. Believe me, if I didn't have a brother and sister in Iran, I wouldn't go there. This is our home.\" The Artist \nFariba Tajrostami, 32, a painter from Iran, came through the gate at New York's Kennedy Airport on Sunday with a huge smile and tears in her eyes as her brothers greeted her with joyful hugs. \n\"I'm very happy. I haven't seen my brothers for nine years,\" she said. \nMiss Tajrostami had tried to fly to the US from Turkey over a week ago, but was turned away. \n\"I was crying and was so disappointed,\" she said. \"Everything I had in mind, what I was going to do, I was so disappointed about everything. I thought it was all over.\" Fariba Tajrostami greeted by her brothers at JFK airport in New York \nM iss Tajrostami said she hopes to study art in the US and plans to join her husband in Dallas soon. He moved from Iran six months ago, has a green card and is working at a car dealership. The PhD student \nNima Enayati, an Iranian PhD student based in Milan, was prevented from boarding a flight to the US on Jan. 30. He had a visa to conduct research on robotic surgery at Stanford University in California. On Sunday night, he finally arrived in New York. \n\"It feels great finally I'm here,\" Enayati said at the airport in New York. \"Considering the last 10 days we had no idea if we'll be able to make it or not.\" Iranian bioengineering researcher Nima Enayati walks out of a gate at JFK airport Credit: AP \nM r Enayati said he feels safe for now, but worries that the travel ban could inhibit research in the future. \nHe said: \"We always had this open collaboration around the world. We never had concerns about whether we would be able to go somewhere physically or not.\" The fiancé \nMahsa Azabadi, 29, an Iranian-American who lives in Denver, was forced to put her wedding plans on hold after her fiancé, Sorena Behzadfar, was turned away when he tried to board a plane to travel from Iran to the US on Jan 28. \nOver the weekend Mr Behzadfar was cleared for travel and was expected to arrive at Boston's Logan Airport ahead of their wedding on May 12. \nMiss Azabadi, a US citizen who has lived int he country for 11 years, said: \"It's been a really tough week to figure out what will happen to us. \n\"We want to be the best and do the best for the people and for this country. We would love to have the opportunity.\" The Syrian Doctor \nDr. Amer al-Homssi left his home in Chicago for the happiest of reasons: to get married in the UAE. But when the 24-year-old tried to return to the US days after his wedding he was turned away. \nDr al-Homssi is a Syrian citizen and when he reached the security at Abu Dhabi airport, a US official drew a thick black line through his American visa and wrote “Cancelled EO 59447v.8”. \nLawyers in Chicago raced to a federal court a filed a lawsuit on his behalf while his fellow doctors stood in the courtroom in their white lab coats in a symbol of solidarity. His lawyers said the doctor, who is a resident at a University of Illinois hospital, was “collateral” damage” of Mr Trump’s order. \nAfter days of legal wrangling, he was cleared to board a new flight back home to Chicago. When he finally was able to get back supporters were waiting for him at the airport with cheers and homemade signs. “Doc: You Make America Great”, read one placard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T10:47:16.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
