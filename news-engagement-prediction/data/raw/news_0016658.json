Read More How did Valentine's Day begin? (Photo: Getty Images) \nValentine's Day is an old tradition thought to have originated from a Roman Festival known as Lupercalia, according to History.com. \nIt was held on February 15 as a fertility festival dedicated to Faunus, the Roman god of agriculture. \nDuring the celebrations boys would draw names of girls from a box and the pair would be partners during the festival. \nThese matches often led to marriage. \nThe festival survived the initial rise of Christianity but was outlawed at the end of the 5th century when Pope Gelasius declared February 14 St Valentine's Day.

The medieval English poet took quite a few liberties with history. He'd drop his poetic characters into real-life historical events leaving readers wondering if that's what really happened. \nThere is no actual record of Valentine's Day before Chaucer's poem in 1375. It's in Parliament of Foules that he links the tradition of courtly love to the St Valentine's feast day - the tradition didn't exist until after his poem. \nThe poem refers to February 14 as the day of birds coming together to find a mate. “For this was sent on Seynt Valentyne’s day / Whan every foul cometh ther to choose his mate,” he wrote and maybe invented Valentine's Day as we now know it. Who was St Valentine?

Valentine felt this was unfair so he celebrated marriages in secret. When the emperor found out he was thrown in jail and sentenced to death. \nHe may also have been Bishop of Terni, also martyred by Claudius II on the outskirts of Rome. There are similarities between the priest's and bishop's stories, which leads people to believe they are the same man. \nThere's so much confusion around St Valentine that the Church stopped veneration of him in 1969 - though he is still listed as an official saint. \n“Valentinus” is from the Latin word for worthy, strong or powerful, and was a popular name between the second and eighth centuries AD meaning there are several martyrs with the same name. There are actually a dozen Valentines listed and there's even a Pope Valentine. The actual day we celebrate is known as St Valentine of Rome to set him apart. What does he really have to do with love? \nValentine did help marry couples in secret, which is arguably very romantic. He is the patron saint of beekeepers and epilepsy among other things..like the plague, fainting and travelling. That doesn't stop people calling on his help for those romantically involved. He's now also patron of engaged couples and happy marriages. Why is his skull kept in Rome? \nYes, that's right. St Valentine's skull is housed and adorned in flowers in Rome. It's actually on display in the Basilica of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. \nIt was found when people were excavating a catacomb near Rome in the early 1800s. The skeletal remains and other relics now associated with St Valentine were dug up. It's the norm for these to be split and distributed to reliquaries - places that keep relics - around the world. If you wanted to see other parts of the saint, he's on display in the Czech Republic, Ireland, Scotland, England and France. Why do we give Valentine's cards? \nAnother idea is that when he was sent to prison, he sent a letter to a young girl he had fallen in love with and signed it \"From your Valentine\". \nIt's thought this was the first ever Valentine's Day greeting .

Read More Why are roses associated with Valentine's Day? It's all about passion (Photo: Getty) \nRoses have been the symbol of love since the early 1700s when Charles II of Sweden brought the Persian poetical art known as the \"language of flowers\" to Europe. \nThroughout the 18th century, ladies loved their floral dictionaries, which listed the symbolic meanings of different flowers, according to YourTango.com. \nThe red rose was believed to be the flower favoured by Venus, the Roman Goddess of Love, and has therefore come to represent that. Why cupid? Cupid and Psyche \nCupid is the god of desire, erotic love, affection and attraction. He is the son of Venus, goddess of love, and war god Mars. Cupid in Latin is 'amor', which means love. When did Valentine's Day become commercial? This is so not who I wanted a card from... (Photo: Getty) \nIt wasn't until the 18th century that Valentine's Day took off in England. Lovers began to send trinkets, cards and flowers to their loved ones. A huge amount of printed cards would get sold, then in 1913 Hallmark Cards in Kansas City began mass producing specific Valentine's Day cards. Now about a billion cards are sold every year and it's the second biggest card sending time of the whole year. Why do we sign cards anonymously? It was the Victorian that started sending roses - thanks guys \nApart from the embarrassment, there was an actual tradition started by the Victorians. They thought it was bad luck to sign the cards with their actual names. It was also the Victorians that sent roses as they were Venus' favourite flower.
