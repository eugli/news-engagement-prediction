(Adnan Abidi/Reuters)\nThough China has launched a campaign to improve air quality, authorities have been reluctant to draw direct links between air pollution and mortality, with the health ministry saying it had \"no data\" linking smog to higher incidences of cancer.\n\"It is currently too early to draw conclusions about the extent of the impact of smog on health, especially its long-term impact on the body,\" a ministry spokesman told media during a press briefing in January.\nIn a long-term national healthcare plan published last October, the government acknowledged the link between health and pollution, and pledged to assess the precise impacts as well as boost environmental monitoring capabilities.\n\nÂ© Thomson Reuters, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T17:56:59.104+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
