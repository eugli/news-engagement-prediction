After one user pointed out: 'Umm didn't you sleep with gaz whilst charlotte was in hospital losing his baby?' she replied: 'Maybe she should learn about contraception then ?! Not my fault lol allow u.' Tension: The 28-year-old made the 'vile' remark after one fan pointed out that she had slept with Charlotte's ex Gary 'Gaz' Beadle Row: The scathing attack began after a post from MTV's Twitter account pointed out that Jemma partied at the same Newcastle club, Livellos, as Charlotte and her rumoured new boyfriend - and Jemma's ex - Stephen Bear Not impressed: Horrified fans rushed to Charlotte's defence in the wake of Jemma's comments The reality star caused uproar with the throwaway remark - referring to Charlotte's horrific ordeal as she suffered an ectopic pregnancy, after falling pregnant with ex-boyfriend Gary Beadle's child last March. The Geordie Shore star opened up in an emotional interview with Heat magazine - confessing that the devastating incident happened last month while he was away filming Ex On The Beach, and that she was rushed to hospital for an operation. The 25-year-old reality TV star, who had been filming Geordie Shore: Big Birthday Battle at the time, said she wasn't even aware she was pregnant at first, and that she though the pain was down to a heavy period. Oh no: The reality star caused uproar with the throwaway remark - referring to Charlotte's horrific ordeal as she suffered an ectopic pregnancy, after falling pregnant with ex-boyfriend Gary Beadle's child last March 'I thought I had a really bad period because I was bleeding and cramping - I can't describe the pain, it was awful,' Charlotte explained, adding that it felt like she was 'being stabbed in the side'. And horrified fans rushed to Charlotte's defence in the wake of Jemma's comments -writing: 'your vile! Let's hope you never experience the loss of a child!' 'To make that sort of comment about someone who LOST their baby is BANG OUT of order! Disrespectful woman,' another added. 'Fame hungry,' one offered, while yet another said: 'Oh wow....I actually loved you before this comment but as someone who's lost a baby, I think that's an awful thing to say.' Rivals: The rivalry between Charlotte and Jemma has become increasingly toxic as rumours swirl that Charlotte is dating her ex and fellow Ex On The Beach star Stephen Bear 'My God what a vile comment you're no woman because no women would say that about another,' a fifth user penned. The rivalry between Charlotte and Jemma has become increasingly toxic as rumours swirl that Charlotte is dating her ex and fellow Ex On The Beach star Stephen Bear. The Geordie Shore star has been engaged in a stuttering romance over recent weeks. But Stephen Bear is still continuing to deny rumours that he's dating Charlotte Crosby, despite admitting she is 'funny, witty, clever and gorgeous'. The Ex On The Beach star, 27, claimed that they weren't together because of timing, but couldn't resist cheekily quipping that she was pregnant with his child. The CBB star told OK! Magazine : 'Charlotte ticks a lot of my boxes â€“ she's funny, witty, clever, she's got all the right attributes. 'But as I'm filming Celebs Go Dating it's a case of right girl, wrong time. But who knows what will happen in the future.' Adding insult to injury: TV bosses DROP Stephen Bear from the Celebs Go Dating agency and 'BAN' him from the show's launch party because of his relationship with Charlotte Crosby Making light of the situation, he then joked: 'She's pregnant with my baby!' Stephen insisted he's single as he prepares to appear on dating show Celebs Go Dating, but added that after the series he would ask Charlotte out as she's 'gorgeous'. It comes as Charlotte packed on the PDA with her rumoured boyfriend at the MTV Brand New gig at Camden's Electric Ballroom last week. The pair have been linked romantically for months, but appeared to confirm their relationship earlier this week by sporting matching 'His and Hers' jumpers - which Bear was still sporting in Camden. An insider told The Sun : 'Bear and Charlotte have been snogging loads on set for Just Tattoo Of Us and have hardly kept it a secret to the crew. It's clear they are besotted with each other.'
