It is now Aerosmith' Walk This Way instead of Led Zeppelin's Whole Lotta Love : Dior Homme (2014): A detailed review of Dior Homme with the face of Robert Pattison you will find in Sergey's article Dior Homme Eau for Men: Iris and Common Taste . Iris was the heart and soul of the very first, i.e. the original Dior Homme created by Olivier Polge and launched in 2005, then it dropped out from the Dior Homme Sport 2008 's pyramid to come back in 2012, but not for long. As we see now, Dior's in-house perfumer Francois Demachy has found a cooler and much more dynamic ingredient, which is pink pepper. I hope you're still following me with all these different versions under the same name of Dior Homme and Dior Homme Sport. Every 4 years, Dior re-launches these two perfumes without making any changes in the names, so it is not easy to keep track of which is which. To explain it, leaving aside a commercial motive to keep your attention on the successful fragrance, I presume that Dior cares to keep their clients updated with new trends: you are still wearing your classic Dior brand, but it never fails to smell modern! You might have noticed a similar attentiveness towards Miss Dior 's and Miss Dior Cherie 's customers. What also remains the same is Dior's devotion to cool rock music. Before Robert Pattison, in 2012, Jude Law was driving from Paris to Riviera listening to the Rolling Stones : Elena Knezhevich founded Fragrantica together with Zoran Knezevic in 2007. Since then Elena has taken care of its design and content as the Editor-in-Chief. Elena was born in Russia, studied Slavic languages and literature in Moscow, and lived in Sarajevo and Belgrade, where the idea of Fragrantica was born. Now she resides in California. \"I have had a nomadic life style since I was born, changing homes, cities and countries. I love having this island on the Internet that I built myself, to reach from everywhere and feel at home.\" Advertisement Add Your Review Become a member of this online perfume community and you will be able to add your own reviews.
