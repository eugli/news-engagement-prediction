Holmes \nThe students at the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf had set up the bait: a buffet of bird seed and peanut butter served on tree stumps, pine cones, and empty egg cartons. \nThen they waited. \nSome peered through windows. Others walked the campus with their eyes fixed on the nearest tree. Soon, a flurry of hands pointed to the sky. Four birds with white wings flew overhead, and the students wrote down their findings -- their first as citizen-scientists in a global research project. \nMore than 100 students in first through 12th grades at the Germantown school participated in the 20th annual Great Backyard Bird Count, an international project to collect data on wild birds and post results in real time. \nScientists use the information for studies including migration patterns, habitat deterioration, and the effects of climate change. \n“The collection of this data is critical because the scientists” can’t do it alone, said Steven Saffier, coordinator of \n“This gets a lot of information to scientists quickly,” \nMore than 160,000 people in at least 100 countries -- including at least 13,000 in Pennsylvania and New Jersey -- are expected to participate in the count, organized by the National Audubon Society and the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, a nonprofit that studies bird species and is affiliated with Cornell University. \nLast year, 163,700 bird-watchers identified 5,689 species -- more than half the known species on the planet. \nParticipants count the birds, identify them according to online guides, and then enter their findings on birdcount.org . \n“Obviously [the students] won’t be able to identify the bird’s song, but their sense of vision is heightened, so bird-watching is a natural fit,\" Yorgey said. \nThey had prepared for weeks, making sustainable bird feeders out of materials such as recyclable seltzer bottles. In an exercise to help them feel the sound vibration in a bird’ \nDuring the school's daylong count, Saffier led an hour-by-hour presentation to help students identify birds, and Carrie Barron, assistant \nStanding just inside the doors of the school's Maguire Student Center, Gizelle Gonzalez, 9, spotted a Carolina chickadee in a nearby tree. \n“Inside we do experiments,” said Keeley, who heads the elementary school science department, “but this is global science and active research.
