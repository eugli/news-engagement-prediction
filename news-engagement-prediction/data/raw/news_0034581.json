The model’s appreciation of the holiday is matched by her fellow Angels, all of whom have fun things planned today. But regardless of how they’ll celebrate, the VS girls agree on the necessity of embracing your inner vamp—and doing a little shopping—on the most romantic day of the year. “V-Day is all about your daring side, and shopping at VS makes you comfortable with that,” shares Martha Hunt, who plans on picking up a lace bustier in cherry red. Even those whose plans are of the Netflix-and-chill variety could do with a little boost. “No matter what you do, whether it’s a hot date or a girls’ night, make sure you get ready for the holiday by wearing sexy lingerie,” says Adriana Lima, who as the brand’s most prominent face knows a thing or two about the importance of sexiness. “It makes you feel good about yourself and gets you in the mood for a hot night!” Here, the Angels share their plans for the big day and their fondest V-Day memories. Loading View on Instagram Adriana Lima “Most people celebrate with their significant other, but for me, it is also all about celebrating with my girls. I think it is really important to buy a little gift for everyone in your life. I send flowers to my mom and give little gifts to all of my friends so that everyone has a valentine! For me, Valentine’s Day is about love and celebrating that love. It’s not just a couple’s thing! The best gifts I receive on Valentine's Day are from my two mini Angels. They treat me to yummy chocolates or decorated cookies and handmade cards. They’re so cute!” Loading View on Instagram Alessandra Ambrosio “I like to keep it simple on Valentine’s Day, so a quiet candlelit dinner at home is always amazing. Every year my kids make me gifts. There have been some unusual ones over the years, and I can’t wait to see what they will come up with this year!” Loading View on Instagram Jasmine Tookes “Every Valentine’s Day is special for me. I always celebrate at a beautiful restaurant and have a candlelit dinner. My ideal V-Day is just spending the day together—maybe going for a couples massage and then to a nice dinner and a movie. I like to make the decision together about what we want to do. I must say I have been pretty lucky and have had great gifts! I’ve gotten special pieces of jewelry in the past that I’ve loved, but the quickest ways to my heart are candles and pizza!” Loading View on Instagram Romee Strijd “I would say dressing up and going out for a nice dinner [is an ideal Valentine’s Day]. Call me crazy, but coming home to roses on the floor, candles lit, with romantic music playing in the background is not my cup of tea! However, a nice gift would do just the trick—or a personal dance party, blasting Shakira alone in my apartment, would be perfect if you ask me! Holiday shopping gets me in the mood for sure; I like treating myself a little bit more! I love going to the stores and looking at all of the fun Valentine’s things to buy.” Loading View on Instagram Martha Hunt “I can’t say I’ve done anything exceptionally romantic [for Valentine’s Day], but once I had a boyfriend graffiti stencil images of me hidden at some of my favorite locations in New York City. That’s one of the grandest romantic gestures I’ve ever received. A karaoke date would make an unconventional Valentine’s Day. I’m passionate about serenading my boyfriend, even though I can’t sing!” Loading View on Instagram Josephine Skriver “It is hard not to be in the mood for Valentine’s Day when you work for Victoria’s Secret! I am in the mood all year long. Around V-Day, I make sure to pamper myself and go shopping for the right outfit. One year I had to travel, so I left sticky notes with reasons why I love my boyfriend everywhere around the house. I put them on his pillow, the bathroom mirror, and on other things I knew he would see.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:40:29.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
