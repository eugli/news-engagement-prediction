CardioSleeve is a stethoscope attachment that records synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and heart sound signals, transmits real-time data to any smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth, and offers cloud-based analysis to help physicians provide diagnostic interpretation of a patient's heart in the office or from remote locations. In conjunction with American Heart Month, the announcement highlights the availability of state-of-the-art technology that can help clinicians more quickly and accurately detect heart disease. Physicians and other qualified clinicians are utilizing CardioSleeve in such clinical applications as murmur and heart sound analysis, ECG analysis of 22 arrhythmias and interval measurements, heart failure identification, cardiac drug therapy titration, cardiotoxicity and cardiomyopathy, pre-operation planning and post-operation follow-up, emergency response, and hospital discharge patient monitoring. \"Henry Schein is proud to team up with Rijuven and grow our portfolio of solutions that help address cardiovascular disease, which is the cause of one in three deaths in the United States, according to the American Heart Association,\" said Frank Prendergast, Director, Equipment Portfolio Management, Henry Schein Medical, the U.S. medical business of Henry Schein, Inc. \"Clinicians can rely on Henry Schein to continue to invest in new innovations in health care technology that help clinicians provide faster treatment, more efficient care, and hopefully a prolonged life for patients.\" CardioSleeve produces results that are built into a physician's Electronic Health Record (EHR) system to track patients, review tests with playback, and enable practitioners to consult remotely. Detailed PDF reports can be generated and viewed through web access at any point of care. Various tools built within the mobile app, including digital caliper, trend analysis, cloud patient management, and telehealth connectivity, can all be used with the CardioSleeve. \"With more than 85 million Americans having some form of cardiovascular disease, and half of the sudden cardiac deaths occurring outside of hospitals – according to the American Heart Association – it is inevitable that our front-line clinicians will need to rapidly assess abnormalities and diseases of the heart,\" said Justin Bass, Chief Strategist, Rijuven. \"Supported by a dedicated Henry Schein Sales Team, CardioSleeve can help the 2.9 million nurses, 800,000 physicians, and 90,000 physician's assistants across the country produce real-time results to detect arrhythmias, murmur pathology, and heart failure thanks to this life-saving innovation.\" About Henry Schein, Inc.
