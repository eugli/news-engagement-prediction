We were just fortunate to end up on the winning side. Our defense really came for us — defense wins championships — and we definitely played hard enough to deserve to win.\" \nFor senior center Christion Adams, the lone senior starter from last year's team who finished with five points, the Clippers' scratch-and-claw effort depicted his four years on varsity. \n\"We had to work hard,\" he said. \"We knew it was going to be a low-scoring game, so it was going to come down to who wanted to scrap more and who was going to play harder and get on the floor. That was us tonight.\" \nPoly coach Sam Brand summed up the Engineers night in two words: \"It's frustrating.\" \n\"We were trying to do things offensively that we just didn't do,\" Brand said. \"We didn't execute what we were trying to do. They did what they were trying to do just a little more and they got the win. It's very disappointing. I feel that we were the better team. I still feel like we're the better team. Our guys missed wide-open look after wide-open look. Guys have been in the gym all year working on that all season. Yeah, it's frustrating.\" \nThe first half picked up where the regular-season game left off — an intense, defense-first game. Neither team was able to get into a consistent offensive flow until the Clippers made a late run to take a 23-18 lead at the break. \nAfter hitting just one free throw in the first quarter, Price got going in the second quarter. He went for nine in the quarter and four during the Clippers' 6-0 closing run, finishing with a strong double-pump putback with close defense from Perry. \nPerry, the hero in the regular-season win with a team-high 21 points, was limited to just two free throws in the first half. \ntwitter.com/GlennGrahamSun \nBaltimore City Division I championship \n(at Coppin State) \n3 Patterson 42, 2 Poly 40 \nPA – Price 20, Mungo 10, Adams 5, Clemons 3, Jones 2, Easter 2. \nTotals: 15 11-23 42. \nPO -- Perry 11, Mims 9, Ali 7, Mosley 1, Walker 2, Stephens 8, Horton 2. \nTotals: 9 21-31 40.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:10:44.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
