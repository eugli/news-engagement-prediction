Along with this announcement, the team made it official that Jim Buss and Mitch Kupchak would no longer serve their roles with the team. This was a major shakeup for the Lakers and basketball Twitter immediately was thrown into a firestorm of takes and old tweets. In particular, a number of Magic&apos;s old tweets were dug up. Now, if you follow Magic on Twitter, you know his persona. He&apos;s super positive and rarely takes shots at any players.\nIf the Bulls are going to win a championship they will need Jimmy Butler and Bulls management should sign him to an extension.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) October 30, 2014 In fact, he&apos;s almost too complimentary of players. With Magic now in charge, these tweets are even more hilarious than they were before. It&apos;s unclear how Magic will do running the Lakers, but we can only hope it&apos;s a bit better than some of his old tweets.\nFor example.\nFor all of you out there questioning Jimmer Fredette of BYU, he is the real deal. #MenCare\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) March 20, 2011 Oh boy.\nI&apos;m impressed w/ the Chicago Bulls starting Rondo, Butler, Wade & MCW off the bench they have the 3rd best group of guards in the league...\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) October 31, 2016 They keep going. We love you, Magic.\nI love Okafor because he&apos;s won a state championship in HS, NCAA Title at Duke and he can bring that championship pedigree to the Lakers.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) June 10, 2015 Can&apos;t even say this one is a bad idea.\nLaker Nation: The Lakers should call LeBron James agent. We know he&apos;s going stay in CLE but they should go after him just in case he leaves.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) May 2, 2016 Facts.\nThe only way San Antonio or Miami don&apos;t win the championship is if neither team makes the finals.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) March 7, 2014 Ok, you lost us, Magic.\nThe Bucks just acquired the next Jason Kidd in Michael Carter-Williams.\n— Earvin Magic Johnson (@MagicJohnson) February 20, 2015 Tags: News , Lakers , Magic Johnson", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/hashtag/MenCare?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/441790369895022592", "https://twitter.com/Lakers/status/834103024763023360", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/793147180932403200", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/727145117572681729", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/527650857895350272", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/568591585912467456", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/tPdBeaMj-ww", "https://twitter.com/Pchopz_", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/608780540536344578", "https://twitter.com/MagicJohnson/status/49565033717440512"], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:36:55.698+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
