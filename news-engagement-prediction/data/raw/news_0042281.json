You might as well send your check to the Sultan of Brunei https://t.co/P6cCO5EnFB — Malcolm Gladwell (@Gladwell) February 21, 2017 \n\nBtw. If Stanford, with $22 billion in the bank, still has needy undergraduates, how are they spending the billions they ALREADY have? https://t.co/P6cCO5EnFB — Malcolm Gladwell (@Gladwell) February 21, 2017 \n— Malcolm Gladwell (@Gladwell) February 21, 2017 \n\nDid I mention Stanford doesn't pay any taxes on its 22bil? Why should I send them money if I'm already subsidizing them? https://t.co/P6cCO5VYx9 — Malcolm Gladwell (@Gladwell) February 21, 2017 \nNever one to mince words, the famed author has frequently excoriated charitable giving to wealthy universities. \nIn 2015 after Wall Street billionaire John Paulson donated $400 million to Harvard , he similarly pounced on the news, insinuating that Paulson's money could have been put to better use. The gift from Paulson was Harvard's largest gift of all time and added to the university's already mammoth $36.4 billion endowment. \n\" If billionaires don't step up, Harvard will soon be down to its last $30 billion,\" he wrote at the time. \nIn Gladwell's criticism on Tuesday, he raised the point that as a nonprofit institution, Stanford doesn't pay taxes on its multi-billion dollar endowment. \" Why should I send them money if I'm already subsidizing them?\" he wrote. \nCritics of colleges receiving money tax free argue that exemptions provided to private colleges can essentially be thought of as American taxpayers subsidizing private endowment funds. At a simplified level, they say, any exemption in one area increases taxes in another area, ultimately falling on the back of the American taxpayer.
