Oxford University students complain they are given too many essays \nA spokesman for Oxford University told The Telegraph a decision had not yet been made but said: “Oxford has been an international university throughout its history and it is determined to remain open to the world whatever the future political landscape looks like.” \nJean-Michel Blanquer, a former director-general of the French ministry of education, confirmed to the paper that discussions between British universities and the French government were taking place. \nIf a decision is made to push ahead with the plans, construction of the campus could reportedly begin as early as next year.
