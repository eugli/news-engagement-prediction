This weekend he's set to watch one player ahead of a recall to international duty for the first time in ages. \nSouthgate became interim manager of the England team earlier this season after Sam Allardyce's sacking one match into his stint with the poisoned chalice. The former Middlesbrough boss was given the job for four games initially. \nA 2-0 win over Malta was followed by a 0-0 draw away to Slovenia before the biggest tests of Southgate's audition against Scotland and Spain. England won the first 3-0 before blowing a two goal lead against Spain to draw 2-2. \nThat was enough to get the 46 year old the job on a full-time basis. And on Saturday Southgate will be at West Ham's game against West Brom to watch Andy Carroll with a view to calling him up for the game's against Germany and Lithuania. \nThe 28 year old has scored four goals in four games since his latest comeback form injury and the incredible form has coincided with somewhat of an upturn in fortunes for the Hammers. \nMore importantly the former Liverpool striker's return to fitness and form has lifted spirits since Dimitri Payet decided that he no longer wanted to play for Slaven Bilic's side before eventually moving back to France. \nCarroll has not played for the national team since 2012, when he was still technically a Liverpool player although on loan at West Ham, and last scored in England colours against Sweden in Euro 2012. \nCheck out our video on what England's team might look like in 2020: \nMichail Antonio could also be on the England manager's radar when he visits the London Stadium on Saturday afternoon. \nEngland play Lithuania in a World Cup qualifier next month. The team currently lead group F with 10 points but the Lithuanians have two respectable draws with Slovenia and Scotland. \nAfter that England test themselves against Germany in a friendly about a year after they infamously won 3-2 in Germany that built everyone's hopes up before Euro 2016, a more innocent time. \nShould Carroll get a call up?
