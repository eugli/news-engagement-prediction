Should we dwell on the crafty bralettes that opened the show, turning Julia Nobis into a groovy slacker surfer? Or the va-va-voom kick-flare dress on Lindsey Wixson? Or those finale numbers that seem destined for the Oscars red carpet this Sunday? Those were all looks that could really get the blood pumping, especially when worn by models as confident and commanding as Anna Ewers and Amanda Murphy. Mrs. Prada’s latest also went heavy on the accessories, creating fluffy everything from shoes to feathered hoods. Most looks were topped off with beaded trim or shell necklaces, creating textural pieces that were artfully cool and sexy in the strangest way. We’ve broken down the key notes of the show here. Check Vogue Runway later for Sarah Mower’s full review. Loading View on Instagram The Teen Dream Scene Longtime Prada collaborator Rem Koolhaas and his firm OMA designed an intricate set for the Prada show, lining the space with beds, small walls, and tables. The whole space was collages with posters on the walls, some giant, others pinned up beside the beds to echo a teenager’s bedroom.

Picking up a thread started in her Fall menswear collection, Mrs. P sent out angora knit pencil skirts with coordinating tops and cardigans, all in vibrant colors with floral beading. Photo: Monica Feudi / Indigital.tv The Mixed-Media Textures Shearling, feathers, beaded fringe—Prada’s show had everything . No look was left untouched by a little voluminous embellishment, whether it was a densely plumed skirt hem or the hundreds of pink beads that jangled on the top of Amanda Murphy’s pink party frock. Photo: Monica Feudi / Indigital.tv The Hats—And Those Feathered Hoods Fall 2017 is shaping up to be the season of the hat, and fast. Today’s Prada show offered a couple variations of newsboy caps in leather, suede, and knits, though the pieces that will really have everyone talking are those marabou feather hoods. Don’t be surprised if they become next season’s street style hit. Photo: Monica Feudi / Indigital.tv The Top Model Cast Call it a parade of Prada muses new and old. This season’s cast included newly inducted Prada favorites Kris Grikaite and Sara Grace Wallerstedt alongside Anna Ewers, Saskia de Brauw, Cameron Russell, Amanda Murphy, Julia Nobis, Natalie Westling, Lineisy Montero, Lexi Boling, and Freja Beha Erichsen.

The show opened with peach fuzzy loafers, segueing through shearling-trimmed mukluks, and ending with some feather-adorned pumps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:56:12.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
