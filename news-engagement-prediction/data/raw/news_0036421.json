Audio: Soviet design history in 500 bus stops (Blueprint for Living) \nBut architects from various Soviet republics found a small place to express their individuality — in the design of bus stops. \nPeter Ortner, a German photographer, spent years collecting photos of these bus stops for his book Back in the USSR: Soviet Roadside Architecture from Samarkand to Yerevan. Photo: A bus stop in Armenia, at the banks of Sawan Lake. (Supplied: Peter Ortner) \nIn an interview with Blueprint for Living , Ortner said he first noticed the bus stops while on holiday driving through a desert in Uzbekistan. \n\"It was just a building of two concrete blocks and one wall and I thought, that's very interesting, it's not merely a bus stop, it's an object of art,\" Ortner said. \n\"And as we drove on I saw another one and another one, and after two or three days I thought maybe this would be some project.\" Photo: A bus stop in Georgia, on a deserted mountain road. (Supplied: Peter Ortner) \nOrtner went back and began photographing as many of them as he could find, year after year. \n\"I wanted to make a complete series, so no preselection, just one bus stop after the another. Not the tallest, not the biggest, just bus stops as they are,\" he said. \n\"Then you can see differences in forms or decline. And so then I went on like a virtual trip along the silk road from Uzbekistan, Central Asia, to the middle of Europe.\" \nOrtner collected more than 700 photos of bus stops, which he had to whittle down to a selection of just 120 for the final version of the book.

They did it their own way,\" Ortner said. \nAnd rather than becoming forgotten in time, the bus stops have continued to change. Photo: A bus stop in Crimea with its sign changed by local artists to say \"New York\". (Supplied: Peter Ortner) \n\"There are some artists who are changing these bus stops and so individuality is still here today,\" Ortner said. \n\"At one bus stop in the Crimean peninsula, some artist just changed the name of the station, and wrote on the top 'New York'. \n\"I think that's great. Some place faraway, some utopia, some dream, but it's definitely not New York.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:11:51.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
