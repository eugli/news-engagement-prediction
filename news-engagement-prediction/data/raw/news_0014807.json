It is owned by Casella Family Brands, which began as a family winery in the Riverina region of New South Wales in 1969. \nAccording to Casella, it exports more than 12.5m cases of Yellow Tail to more than 50 countries every year; more than 2.5m glasses are consumed each day. A bottle retails for approximately A$9 (US$6.90). \nYellow Tail enjoyed considerable success in the US after its launch in 2001. The Super Bowl spot kicks off a new, three-year marketing campaign ‚Äì a renewed push into the US market. But, perhaps unsurprisingly, the ad is not of Australian origin. \nAccording to AdNews , it was directed by Harald Zwart, a Dutch-Norwegian film-maker, known for the 2010 Karate Kid reboot and 2009‚Äôs The Pink Panther 2. It was devised by the New York-based advertising agency Burns Group. Ellie Gonsalves (@EllieGonsalves) Wanna pet my roo?
