His dad was stoked. \nThe accolade comes at the end of a very busy four years for Waititi. He made What We Do in the Shadows (2014), the hugely successful Hunt for the Wilderpeople (2016) , was on the writing team for Moana , and is now directing Thor: Ragnarok in LA. \nBut it won't be a case of \"big American blockbusters-only\" from now on. Waititi says he is still dedicated to telling Kiwi stories, making smaller films, and \"mixing it up\". \nHe is currently working on the scripts for three \"very Taika-esque\" stories, one of which is a werewolf spinoff of What We Do in the Shadows, which he filmed and stared in with Jemaine Clement in Wellington. \n\"It's definitely one of the ones we want to do in the next year or two, it's being written now\", he said of the hotly anticipated spinoff. Ad Feedback \nWaititi says he owes a lot of his success to the support of his parents, who never forced him to get a \"real job\". \nHe will always remember his mum being really happy when he told her he \"just wanted to paint pictures\". \n\"My parents never encouraged me to do science, and they were never thinking 'I can't wait for him to go to university', and my dad was really happy when I said I wanted to be a painter as well, and I guess that was the time when I realised that, oh, it's okay to do this as well.\" \nWaititi said he hadn't had time to properly celebrate the New Zealander of the Year win yet, as he only found out in the middle of the night. \n\"But I think tonight we'll try and go have some drinks, there's a lot of New Zealanders here and I'll try round them up and we'll go hang together.\" \nWaititi's next project will be directing a stop-motion film about Michael Jackson's pet chimp, named Bubbles. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:22:35.024+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
