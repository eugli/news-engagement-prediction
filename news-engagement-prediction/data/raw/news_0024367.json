The decision came on the heels of Conway, who also recently cited the phrase \"alternative facts,\" referencing the nonexistent \"Bowling Green Massacre\" in three separate interviews when defending Trump's travel ban. \n\"I regretted it tremendously. I felt really badly about that and I apologized and I rectified,\" Conway told The Lead host. She then said she was happy to have raised awareness to the story even though she did it \"inartfully.\" \n\"You cited a massacre that didn't happen, you said the media didn't cover it,\" Tapper replied. \n\"What I meant is the media didn't cover the masterminds,\" she said.

Is CNN fake news?\" \nThough Trump has himself referred to CNN as \"fake news\" on multiple occasions, Conway said she was answering on behalf of herself. \n\"No I don’t think CNN is fake news,\" she said. \"I think there are some reports everywhere, in print, on TV, in radio, in conversation that are not well-researched and that are sometimes based on falsehoods.\" Kellyanne Conway: No, I don’t think CNN is fake news https://t.co/Wmbg1yEFWE — The Lead CNN (@TheLeadCNN) February 7, 2017 \nConway later described the \"fake news\" that she claims is aimed at the administration as \"the presumptive negativity about us. It's always believing there's something negative, something nefarious.\" \nShe then added, \"I know firsthand what it's like to have all the haters descend upon you.\" \nTapper said, \"Every day there are these sprays of attacks, sprays of falsehood, coming from the White House.\" \nConway said that despite her recently coming under fire in the media, she would like to extend an olive branch to the network. \n\"I'm now being attacked by the media, including networks that are familiar to you, and I’m just going to keep soldiering on,\" she said, stressing that changes have to come both ways. \"What I would put as an olive branch out to you and your network is, how about more complete coverage?\" \nShortly before Conway's appearance, CNN continued to fact-check the administration and reiterate their stance on Conway's credibility. \n\"CNN was clear, on the record, about our concerns about Kellyanne Conway's credibility, to the New York Times and others,\" read a statement from the network's CNN Communications Twitter account after press secretary Sean Spicer claimed the network retracted their comments. \"We have not 'retracted' nor 'walked back' those comments. Those are the facts.\" \nWatch the full interview with Conway on CNN here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:55:21.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
