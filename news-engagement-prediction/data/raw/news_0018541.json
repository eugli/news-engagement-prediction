She points out that most of those crossing into Manitoba are from Somalia -- one of the seven countries on Trump’s list.\nSince the beginning of January, at least 61 asylum seekers have crossed the border into Manitoba from the U.S., often dropped by smugglers and told to walk long distances in the middle of the night. That’s compared to between 50 and 60 in a typical year.\nIn 2016 there were 7,022 land border crossings by asylum seekers, up from 4,407 in 2015, according to the Canadian Border Services Agency.\nPublic Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Tuesday that “people travelling unprepared in very severe winter weather conditions” is “of concern to us.”\n“We are examining right now what are the appropriate steps to take to protect the integrity of the border, to make sure that public health and safety is properly protected and to make sure that the people involved here are treated in a fair and compassionate way,” Goodale added.\nWith files from CTV’s Jill Macyshon \nRelated Stories At least 22 asylum seekers entered Manitoba from U.S. over weekend: RCMP U.S. federal judges express skepticism about Trump travel ban Photos Immigration lawyer Chantal Desloges speaks to CTV's Power Play from Toronto, on Monday, Jan. 7, 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T03:22:59.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
