Pictures: John Appleyard Wentworth Courier Extra buses to be provided after parents complained children were arriving to school late Kate Bastians, Wentworth Courier February 21, 2017 3:51pm Power pole in man’s driveway\nEXTRA buses will be provided to take Rose Bay Secondary College students to and from school after parents complained their children were arriving to school late because they could not fit onto crammed buses.\nBrandon Boland, who catches the bus from Bronte, said he had not made it onto the 717 bus to school seven times and the 713 bus home three times because it was too full.\nBrandon, 11, said their dad had to drive them to school last Thursday and another student&apos;s mum had to take them last Monday and Wednesday.\n“On my second day of school I was told to get off the bus because it was too full and I was panicking because I got separated from everyone,” he said.\nmedia_camera Brandon and Theo made it onto the 717 on Friday morning but they were packed in like sardines. It was only the second time last week they made it onto the bus.\nHe had to catch the 711 to Bondi Junction, then the 360 to Birrell St and then walk about 500 metres to his house.\n“I was dreading the walk because it was a really hot day and our bags are really heavy.”\nHis mother Lily Boland said that was further than she allowed her sons to walk on busy roads.\n“They are only 11,” she said.\n“It’s the first time they have had to catch public transport so it’s already overwhelming for them and even more daunting if they are left behind.”\nFather Berrick Boland said he saw several students from the College “walking the streets” last Thursday when he drove the boys to school.\n“You can’t leave kids stranded like that, it’s ridiculous,” he said.\nmedia_camera Year 11 student Ali Rudkin says she is often late to school because they buses are too full. Picture: John Appleyard\nYear 11 student Ali Rudkin had to get on the 8.53 bus on Friday — leaving her just seven minutes to get to school — after the earlier bus did not stop for her and three other students on Bondi Rd because it was packed like sardines.\n“It happens often now since a record number of year seven students started year seven this year so now the buses are always full,” she said.\n“I get to school late a lot.”\nARE SELF-SERVE CHECK-OUTS TURNING AUSSIES INTO ‘SWIPERS’?
