Women's basketball: Seniors lead the way for No. 8 Florida State Joe Reedy | The Associated Press Last Updated - Feb 23, 2017 11:22 EST Contact | Archive | RSS \nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. — The seniors on Florida State's women's basketball team will leave as the winningest class in program history. But the eighth-ranked Seminoles still have two huge goals they want to accomplish down the stretch. \nGoing into Thursday's game against Pittsburgh, Florida State still has a chance for at least a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference regular-season title and the top seed for next week's conference tournament. The quartet of Brittany Brown, Kai James, Leticia Romero and Ivey Slaughter is also hoping to get the Seminoles to the Final Four for the first time. — FSU Women's Hoops (@fsuwbb) February 21, 2017 \n\"We've set a high standard but those are two things that we want to do,\" Slaughter said. \"Being so close our sophomore year (the Elite Eight), it put a bitter taste in our mouths that I think it would be a great end to an amazing story.\" \nSlaughter, Brown and Romero have formed the core of the starting lineup for FSU (24-4, 12-2 ACC), which has a 102-29 record since the start of the 2013-14 season. \nRomero, who is averaging 12.1 points per game, is the only women's player in Division I to be shooting 50 percent from the field and 3-pointers along with 90 percent on free throws (50 percent shooting overall; 51.8 percent from 3-point range; 93.7 percent from free throw line). The 5-foot-8 guard led the team in scoring for most of the season but is averaging only 6.7 points over the past seven games. \nBrown, a 5-8 guard who is averaging 9.6 points, has the program record for starts (121) and added another milestone in last Saturday's win over Clemson when she became the first Florida State women's player and 19th in ACC history to have over 300 career steals. \nSlaughter has 21 career double-double games, which is third among current ACC players. The 6-1 forward ranks in the top 10 in the conference in offensive rebounds (fifth), free throw percentage (eighth) and field goal percentage (eighth) while averaging 10.1 points and team-leading 6.2 rebounds.

Losses to Texas and Virginia last week have made some wonder if it could happen for the second straight season but Slaughter thinks the team is back on track after a 33-point win last Saturday against Clemson. \n\"We hit a rough patch during both games where things weren't going our way and after those two losses we've figured that out,\" she said. \"Also we know we can't hold our heads down because once we do that things are just going to get worse for us.\" \nJunior Shakayla Thomas, who is the team's leading scorer (15.0 points), remains questionable after she injured her shoulder against Virginia. \nEven though Semrau wants to keep the focus on Pitt, most of the attention is already on Sunday's contest at league leader and fifth-ranked Notre Dame.

We still have to have a lot of things go the right way and there's a lot of work to be done,\" Semrau said. \nThis article was written by Joe Reedy from The Associated Press and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.
