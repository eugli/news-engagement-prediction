The honorable thing to do is much more likely take ownership of your actions, let the other girl get some closure, admit you fucked up and apologize. That’s what a man would do. That said…it’s equally as viable a choice to lie your ass off and hope for the best. Ideally you’d like less concrete evidence — like not having the naked girl in bed with you also naked, bit of a smoking gun there — but you’ve really only got one shot to have even a chance of avoiding trouble so shoot your lie shot. And for as far as “getting caught naked sleeping in bed with a girl” lies go, saying that she was drunk and slept naked but didn’t feel comfortable unless you were also naked is not the worst lie. I mean completely far-fetched and not possibly based in reality, in that respect it is not a great lie. But at least in this fake scenario, he’s a chivalrous dude taking in lost women and trying his best to make them comfortable. That’s a gentleman. The lie may not have a shot of passing muster but at least he’s making himself look as best he can. \nAdditionally according to Stoolie Sarah whose tweet it is above, he also had a friend send the girlfriend a Facebook message to corroborate this charitable tale of a gentleman merely putting up the wayward drunk girls of the area and trying to keep them comfortable by adhering to their sleep customs. If you’re gonna lie, no matter how insurmountable the odds may seem, you’ve got to lie like you’ve got nothing to lose. And if your friends want to go down with the ship, even better.
