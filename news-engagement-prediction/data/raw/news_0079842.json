Fortunately, the personal trainer is now awake and on the mend.\nHarper reportedly collapsed while working out a New York City gym, resulting in a doctor at the facility administering CPR and a defibrillator to try and resuscitate him.\nAccording to TMZ , the fitness instructor was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he remained unconscious for two days until waking up.\nHarper was hospitalized for a total of eight days, and remains in New York City on doctor’s orders as he’s yet to be cleared to fly home to Los Angeles. Harper later revealed that the condition is genetic, and his mom died from a heart attack.\nLast year, Harper took over the hosting duties of “The Biggest Loser” from Alison Sweeney. © NBC THE BIGGEST LOSER -- Season: 16 -- Pictured: Bob Harper -- (Photo by: Chris Haston/NBC) Thursdays on NBC (8-9 pm ET)\nThe fitness trainer is much beloved for being tough, yet being kind to the contestants. Harper even came out as gay in 2013 on the weight-loss competition show to help one of the contestants, Bobby Salem, who was struggling with telling his own father he was gay.\nHarper revealed on the episode to Saleem, “I’m gay. I knew a very long time ago that I was gay,” adding, “But being gay doesn’t mean being weak. Being gay doesn’t mean that you are less than anybody else. It’s just who you are.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/c8c8c099-e29e-40c4-8210-cc9903c73629/83005264-279b-4dde-9dc0-e51d371359e0.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://feed.theplatform.com/f/BdHJDC/eon_msn&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f0A%2fen-us%2fAAnyMzs%3focid%3dsl&title=%22Biggest+Loser%22+Host+Bob+Harper+Suffers+Heart+Attack&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f0A%2fen-us%2fAAnyMzs%3focid%3dsl", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f0A%2fen-us%2fAAnyMzs&lang=en-us&flow_id=c6a1a9e4-86c3-4cde-84b6-d73e7b45a465", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnyMzs?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnyMzs?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1024&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;576&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/c8c8c099-", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA2oHEB.img", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f0A%2fen-us%2fAAnyMzs%3focid%3dst&text=%22Biggest+Loser%22+Host+Bob+Harper+Suffers+Heart+Attack&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f0A%2fen-us%2fAAnyMzs%3focid%3dst", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnyMzs?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnyMzs?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1280&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;720&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBuarep.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;\\&quot;Biggest", "http://img.s-msn.com/tenant/amp/entityid/AAbDq30.img", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UODq.img", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAnyWqY.img&quot;}}"], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:20:03.834+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
