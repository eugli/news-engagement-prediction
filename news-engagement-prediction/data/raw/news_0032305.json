We went up there completely thinking our house was intact and good, totally unaware that our house was flattened.\" \nREAD MORE: \nGordon said on Monday evening the family of five had managed to move eight of his treasured classic cars to higher ground before they were choppered off the hills. BILLY GORDON \nBilly Gordon snapped one last shot of his Early Valley Rd property before it burnt to the ground. \n\"We couldn't sleep that night, so we went back and one of the fire guys took Lucy and Elvis [the family's dogs] down. They would have been getting pretty smoky by that point.\" \nAfter they pulled up to the ruined 55 acre property on Tuesday morning, Gordon said \"no... it can't be, it can't be.\" \nJohn and Margaret Gordon, and their three children Billy, 20, Rosie, 18, and Jesse,16, were staying at a two bedroom flat with donated mattresses on Wednesday. \nThrough tears, Margaret Gordon said she was \"utterly devastated\" to have lost treasured heirlooms from her late mother. \n\"I had her jewellery, bits of her china, and a pair of my grandma and grandad's china horses\" \nMargaret Gordon said there had been nothing left to salvage from the pile of ash. \nOn the way out, Billy had grabbed some of his mother's pencil drawings and Rosie picked up a picture of her parents' wedding. \n\"I thought, what should I grab, but we thought we were going back, we never thought for a minute that we weren't coming back\". \n\"Even when we went up in the helicopter we thought we were sweet\", Billy said. \nHe had taken one last photo of the home he grew up in, \"just in case\". \n\"We got our heads round it and thought, well, what are going to do now? We're just trying to take one step at a time and work out where we go from here.\" \nAt least 40 of the families classic cars, including a much loved Mark 1 Zephyr brought over from Australia, were gone and it was likely 12,000 pine trees at the back of the property had gone up in the flames. \n\"I don't know if I'm more upset about my cars or my house, but it breaks my head up so it's probably good\" \nTheir pet duck, Donald, and four cats had also not been seen. \n\"Unfortunately there was a stuff up with our insurance before the earthquakes that we didn't realise so we weren't on the books anymore and only had contents insurance. I should have made a fuss then ... and then this happened\", Gordon said. \nA G ivealittle page has been set up to help the family. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:02:09.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
