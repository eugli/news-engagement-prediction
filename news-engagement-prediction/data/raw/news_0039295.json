A post shared by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Feb 13, 2017 at 6:17pm PST Hangover cure: She also shared a pic of her breakfast of champions - hash browns with brown sauce Celebrity perks: Chrissy also shared what looked to be the contents of a gift basket she'd received that included pizza and socks In the late night Snapchat clips she posted, Chrissy could be seen in her finery explaining: 'I'm on the floor. And John is in charge of taking my jewellery off. Take it off.' That proved to be easier said than done as seconds later she screamed in pain as her musician hubby yanked at the jewelry that had got tangled in her hair. 'Oh this is just one that's wrapped up in itself,' he said as he tried to untangle it all. Double trouble: The model could be seen falling to the floor while still in her finery, saying: 'I'm on the floor. And John is in charge of taking my jewellery off. Take it off' Painful process: However, that was easier said than done, scremaing in pain as hubby John Legend yanked on a chain tangled in her hair In a following clip, she asked John: 'Are you mad at me?' 'Why would I be mad at you? You're perfect,' he dutifully replied. 'I dunno,' she continued. 'Coz I got drunk?' Cute couple: 'Are you mad at me?' she asked him. 'Coz I got drunk?' Earlier inthe night: Chrissy turned heads at a Grammys after party thrown by GQ and Chance The Rapper at Chateau Marmont in a burnt orange wraparound gown By late morning Monday, however, Chrissy had rallied herself enough to take some Snapchat video with her gorgeous baby girl Luna. The 10-month-old received an early Valentine's Day gift from North and Saint West and naturally it was a baby pair of their dad Kanye West's Yeezys. Chrissy shared the note that came with the gift-wrapped box along with a shoutout to the kids' mom Kim Kardashian, as well as cute video of Luna blowing kisses at the camera. The adorable tot was wearing a onesie and a bib and her mom added a big pink bow to the side of her head as well as pink hearts as she blew kisses. 'After 3 months of trying to get her to blow kisses, she finally does it for the valentine's snap,' Chrissy wrote. Simply adorable: By late morning Monday, however, Chrissy had rallied herself enough to take some Snapchat video with her gorgeous baby girl Luna Perfect timing: The proud mama gushed that her 10-month-old baby girl had learned to blow kisses just in time for Valentine's day Present: Little Luna also received an early Valentine's Day gift from North and Saint West, sent on their behalf by the reality star mom Kim Kardashian What's this? Luna wasn't quite sure what to make of her new baby Yeezys Read more: Share or comment on this article 79 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:33:17.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
