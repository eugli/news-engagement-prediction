But it was Twitchy favorite James Woods who stole the show. \nIn his opening monologue, Oswalt poked fun at Woods (who was sitting in the front row), saying “I want to be very careful making jokes about [Trump] because I don’t want to be kicked to death by James Woods backstage. Which would be an honor by the way. That guy is amazing.” \nWoods then jumped up on stage to banter back and forth with Oswalt and make fun of his shoes. \n“They’re comfortable!” shouted Oswalt. \n“This is an awards show!” answered Woods. “By the way, I lost half my twitter following today by coming here.” Trending", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:40:15.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
