Siguro, I don't know kung bakit dolyar. Hindi ko sinabi na reporter na 1,000 dollars ang umiikot. That's 50,000 pesos. Naliliitan ka ba sa 50,000,\" he asked. \nHe also told a reporter not to pit him against Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and National Security Adviser Hermogenes Esperon Jr. after they already said there was no plot to unseat President Rodrigo Duterte. \n\"Siguro may mga intelligence reports na hindi nakakarating sa lahat. There are classified reports,\" he said. \nHe then asked the reporter: \"Are you fair on everything that you write?\" \n\"Yes,\" said the reporter. \n\"How about your post on social media?\" \n\"That's my personal.\" \n\"Exactly. As a reporter, you are an ambassador of your newspaper,\" he added, shaking his head. \nShare ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:20:27.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
