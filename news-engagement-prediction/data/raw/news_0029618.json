Victory seems all but certain for the Atoms, until Boston’s stern-faced Coach Bonderchuck calls an 11th-hour play during which the team mascot catches a pass from the Americans’ pretty-boy quarterback.\nWhen the episode originally aired in October, this is what the scene looked like:\nAn image from ‘The Town.’ —FOX But thanks to the magic of digital animation, this is how the same shot appeared in Sunday’s rerun:\nThe updated shot from ‘The Town.’ —FOX According to Simpsons executive producer Matt Selman, who grew up in Watertown, a quick change like this wouldn’t have been possible during earlier seasons of the show.\n“Back when the episodes were hand-drawn, something like this would have been impossible,” Selman said. “But with digital animation, we can sneak in last-minute changes like this. The technology is amazing.”\nSelman said the idea for the swap first came up while members of the staff were watching Sunday’s big game together.\n“We were laughing about how funny it would be to add something about the Super Bowl to the episode,” Selman said. “When [showrunner] Al Jean heard us, he said, ‘Why don’t we go ahead and change it?’ We were just joking, but he was completely serious.”\nUnfortunately, if you wanted to see the Super Bowl 51 homage and missed Sunday’s airing, you’re out of luck. Selman said that whether you see “The Town” On Demand, on DVD, or on TV during a future rerun, it will be the original version that aired in October.\n“For an episode that’s really a love letter to Boston, this felt like the perfect one-time addition,” Selman said. “It’s kind of cocky, but everyone else already hates the Patriots and their fans, so it’s OK.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:18:30.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
