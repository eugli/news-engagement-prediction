Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nKim Kardashian may have taken several months out of her usual routine of naked photoshoots, eye-goggling promotional gigs and general Snapchat madness, but now she's back, she's determined to rebuild her personal brand. \nAnd what better way to raise a few eyebrows but to team up with the editor of French Vogue and make her a celebratory salad to congratulate her on getting one million Instagram followers? \n\"So I was looking on Instagram today and I realised Carine is almost at a million followers and I wanted to celebrate,\" Kim says in the short film posted to Instagram. Kim's got something up her sleeve (Photo: Instagram/carineroitfeld) \nWearing an oversized coat with her long brunette hair worn poker straight, she continues: \"I wanted to make her a cake but I don't have any of the ingredients. But I do have the ingredients to make a salad, so I'm going to make her a celebratory salad.\" \nMmm. Celebratory salad. \nA video montage of Kim making said salad then plays, showing her chopping giant tomatoes, squeezing a lemon and drizzling it over the top of some green leaves. So far, so normal. So far, so normal... (Photo: Instagram/carineroitfeld) \nShe then snaps a cucumber in half and drops both parts in... without chopping them or anything. \nA load of dressing then gets poured over the top and she licks the excess off her finger while gazing into the camera lens. \nBizarrely, she then swishes her hair around while a cloud of spinach rains down on her head and shoulders. Thanks, Kim (Photo: Instagram/carineroitfeld) \nFinally, a single '1' candle is placed in the centre of the bowl and lit, even though it will surely drip wax all over that freshly prepared salad. \n\"Happy one million!\" she says while blowing out her match. \nIt comes after the mum of two revealed her first taste of fame came from starring in Barbie magazine circa 1988. \nIn it, an eight-year-old Kim studies the Hollywood Stars Map and poses on the Walk Of Fame while grinning wildly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T21:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T16:57:46.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
