(Austin Young) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   5:00 AM \nLenora Claire is sick of reading death threats, rape fantasies and near daily screeds from the diagnosed schizophrenic who also stalked Ivanka Trump — and she’s calling on the First Daughter to help her hash out a solution. \n“The Trumps have the biggest platform in the world, and they haven’t done anything for this bipartisan issue,” the Los Angeles-based TV producer, 36, told the Daily News. “I would like to have a lunch with her. I would like to get our nails done.” \nClaire is one subject of Saturday’s stalking-themed episode of CBS’s “48 Hours,” which will feature a Facetime interview with 34-year-old Justin Massler — the Nevada native who copped in 2012 to terrorizing Trump over two years and once threatened to kill himself in her jewelry store. \nMassler, a former prep school student turned drifter who legally changed his name to Cloud Starchaser years ago, set his sights on fire-engine red-haired Claire — then an art curator — after LA Weekly profiled her in May 2011 for its Best of L.A. feature. \nNo stranger to art scene “shenanigans,” she wasn’t concerned when Massler, out on bail after a Trump-stalking stint, turned up at her gallery clad in a spacesuit — that is, until he opened his mouth. Ivanka Trump was terrorized by Justin Massler over two years. (KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS) \n“He told me that I reminded him of Jessica Rabbit meets Leeloo from ‘The Fifth Element,’ and that I was a supreme being,” Claire said. “And that he was going to stalk me.” \nA man of his word, the celebrity-obsessed Massler — believing at various times that he is Harry Potter, Jesus Christ, Roger Rabbit, Neo from “The Matrix” and the Messiah — has since slung thousands of nonsensical tweets, emails, Facebook messages and YouTube comments at Claire, including a threat to gas her with the Nazi pesticide Zyklon B (she is Jewish), a rape fantasy involving hobbits, and frequent plots to kidnap Claire so he can harness her “magical powers.” She says she has never once responded. \nNow, going on six years, a typical day for Claire begins with waking up, checking Massler’s latest drivel and tracing his location from the IP address. Her mood can hinge on his tone, which ping-pongs from reverent to violent, and his proximity to L.A. \nThe ordeal has wholly consumed her life. But Claire, raised by a psychiatrist father, has compassion for her stalker: “He’s really sick,” she said. “He needs help, and his family has failed him.” Massler once threatened to commit suicide in Ivanka Trump's jewelry store. (HERMANN, Marc A.) \nAfter Massler sent her casting-director boss a death threat in September 2015, Claire finally went to the Los Angeles Police Department — where, she says, officers “mocked” her and suggested she dye her hair and get off social media. \nServing her homeless stalker a restraining order was near impossible given that he had no known address. Officers in late 2015 were only able to deliver a temporary two-week order after Massler was corralled in San Francisco for a separate incident. \nThe “48 Hours” Facetime interview in early November finally helped cops locate him in Utah, where they served him with Claire’s three-year protective order. She has not heard from him in the last two weeks. \nAccused Ivanka Trump stalker insists he’s not crazy \nClaire has myriad ideas to improve the system, which she’s drafted into legislative proposals: electronic restraining orders served via read receipts, a national stalking registry to facilitate cross-state tracking, laws for cyberstalking and doxxing, an ankle monitor initiative for stalkers on probation, and an app that would notify victims when their stalker is in the vicinity. Claire was interviewed for the stalking-themed episode of CBS's \"48 Hours.\" (Austin Young) \nShe also teamed up in early 2016 with Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who presented her ideas to the Department of Justice on Dec. 13, and with fellow “48 Hours” subject Peggy Farrell, with whom she launched the nonprofit Victim Empowerment Resource Safety and Education Center. She recently cut a deal for a TV docuseries to show victims how to negotiate with cops and courts and stay safe. \nClaire intends to use her platform to make clear that stalking victims — who number 7.5 million annually, according to the National Center for Victims of Crime — are not limited to the Kardashians and Trumps of the world. \n“It happens to real people who do not have the benefit of hiring security firms and living in gated communities,” she said. “I’m a regular person that’s had enough, and I want to not only change the laws, but empower people.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:21:49.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
