The 36-year-old reality superstar ensured all eyes were on her on Wednesday in Los Angeles, when she sported a skintight, white lace corset with Yeezy sweatpants. Kim's low-cut top made her dangerously close to a wardrobe malfunction, which she paired with an oversized puffer coat.

Photo: X17online.com The Keeping Up With the Kardashians also spent Wednesday wishing her late father, Robert Kardashian, a happy birthday. The famous attorney, who died in 2003 of esophageal cancer, would have been 73 years old. \"Happy Birthday dad!\" Kim tweeted alongside a black-and-white throwback family pic including her mother, Kris Jenner, and siblings Kourtney, Khloe and Rob Kardashian. \"I love this family photo.
