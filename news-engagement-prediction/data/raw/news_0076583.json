PHOTO: IMAGE GRAB \nFormer Indian cricket team captain Virender Sehwag trolled a female university student on Monday for announcing her support for two Muslim students who were attending an event disrupted by a nationalist party. \nGurmehar Kaur expressed solidarity with Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid, both students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), after members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) disrupted a session which was under way at Delhi University. \n“I am a student of Delhi University. I am not afraid of ABVP. I am not alone. Every student of India is with me,” Kaur said. \nSehwag mocked the girl saying, “I didn’t score two triple centuries, my bat did.” \n— Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) February 26, 2017 \nWhile the former cricketer was apparently responding to the varsity incident, he was referring to Kaur’s tweet that she posted a year ago saying, “Pakistan did not kill my dad, war killed him.” The girl’s father Captain Mandeep Singh was killed during the Kargil war. Not surprising that \"nationalists\" mock @mehartweets for one pic out of an entire series. Their vision as always is limited by their hate. pic.twitter.com/SCzRL76Jf7 \n— SamSays (@samjawed65) February 26, 2017 \nMeanwhile, Kaur filed a complaint with a women right panel, saying she was threatened with rape over her social media campaign against ABVP. \nABVP is the student wing of Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh, which is the ideological parent of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). \nSehwag’s move also did not go well with social media users who termed it to be in bad taste. @ShekharGupta @virendersehwag what's sad is that the poor girl is being used as political pawn and it seems you are a party to it ..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T15:56:44.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
