The film had won the Oxfam Best Film on Gender Equality Award at the Mumbai Film Festival. But in what looks like a backward leap in the history of evolution, the CBFC has refused to certify a film that explores an Indian woman’s sexuality. The letter sent by the CBFC rejecting the censorship, states, “The story is lady-oriented, their fantasy above life. There are contentious sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society.” ALSO READ – Shocking! CBFC rejects certification of Prakash Jha’s next as it challenges patriarchy? \nThis has enraged Twitter users, who are taking to the micro-blogging site to vent out their anger at a decision like this. From questioning CBFC ’s thought process behind the decision to trolling the Board’s members, Twitter is abuzz with tweets discussing the board’s refusal to certify the film that stars renowned actors such as Konkona Sen Sharma and Ratna Pathak Shah. The rant has also received voice from industry insiders such as Ram Gopal Varma and Farhan Akhtar . Here are some of the tweets that slammed CBFC for the seemingly regressive move… Below is the reason CBFC listed for denying #LipstickUnderMyBurkha a release.
