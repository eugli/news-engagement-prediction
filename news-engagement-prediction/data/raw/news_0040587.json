Video: At least five houses have been destroyed by the fires (Photo: Twitter/howesaman) (ABC News) \n\"The situation remains very serious,\" Christchurch Civil Defence Controller David Adamson said. \n\"Police and the Defence Force have had a huge job overnight with evacuations, the setting-up of cordons around key areas and security patrols of areas that have been evacuated.\" \nFifteen helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, the maximum number that can safely be in the air at any one time, have been despatched amid forecasts for winds that could fan the flames. \nMore than 200 firefighters are battling the blaze. \nA change in the wind direction is predicted for later in the week that will lower temperatures and humidity and could slow the fire's progress, emergency workers said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:37:09.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
