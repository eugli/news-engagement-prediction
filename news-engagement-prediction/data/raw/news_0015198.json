Get 200g of good quality flour or organic flour. Add same quantity of water. Put the mixture on the bench and leave it for 24 hours. Bubbles should form. Build it up with more flour and water to create the dough. Repeat this process. Retain some of the culture and \"keep feeding it\" to use next time. Keep the yeast starter in the fridge. \nIt can take up to three days to build up the initial sourdough starter and several hours to shape then bake the dough. \nMr Haden said judges found one baker this year had added vinegar into their bread to achieve the \"sour taste\" recognisable in sourdough loaves. \n\"The aroma gave it away,\" he said. \n\"There are bakers out there who cut corners with making that style of bread. \n\"If you want to speed [up the process] you add in a bit of commercial yeast ... and then to compensate for not having that longer development, which gives you that authentic taste, you add some vinegar to make it taste like sourdough.\" \nThe winner of each class and overall champion bread will be announced on February 14. \nThe Sydney Royal has competitions for a number of other food types including coffee, olive oil, chocolate, pasta, beer and cider and aquaculture.
