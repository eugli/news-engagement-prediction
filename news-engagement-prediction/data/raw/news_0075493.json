The victory is O’Connell’s first after 21 total nominations; until Sunday, O’Connell was the most-nominated person in Oscars history without a victory. \nBorn in New York on Long Island, the 59-year-old scored his first sound mixing nomination for Terms of Endearment . He’s earned multiple nominations for Tom Cruise films ( Top Gun , Days of Thunder , A Few Good Men ) as well as Michael Bay blockbusters ( The Rock , Armageddon , Pearl Harbor , Transformers ). O’Connell was nominated for a Mel Gibson movie before, too, earning a citation for the director’s Apocalypto , Gibson’s last film before Hacksaw Ridge . \nIn an interview with NPR last week, O’Connell said he had stopped paying attention to his mounting nominations and losses. “I almost feel like this is like a rebirth for me at this point, you know?” \nBest Sound Mixing is one of two sound categories at the Academy Awards, along with Best Sound Editing. Sound mixing focuses on creating the audio mix of a film by using sounds recorded both on set and in post-production; sound editing involves the creation of sound elements (like the explosions in Hacksaw Ridge ). More on both categories can be found here . \nThe 89th Annual Academy Awards, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel, are airing live from Los Angeles on ABC.
