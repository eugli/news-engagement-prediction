Share via Twitter Gregg DeGuire/Getty Images Jenna Dewan Tatum stuns on the red carpet on the regular—and as such, she has plenty of style advice and inspiration to pass on to her 3-year-old daughter with husband Channing Tatum , Everly. But there is one gorgeous gown in particular that holds a special place in Dewan Tatum's heart— and her closet—that she is holding on to for her daughter to wear someday. Dewan Tatum revealed to InStyle that she's been collecting several items of hers to pass on to her daughter when she's older. \"I have my wedding dress,\" she told the magazine . \"I have some pieces of jewelry to give to her, and lots of memorabilia that I'm keeping for her, for sure.\" But when it comes to her myriad red carpet looks, the one special gown Dewan Tatum wanted to save is the black lace Rachel Roy gown that she wore to the 2013 Academy Awards. Why? Because she was pregnant with Everly when she wore it, and she wants to hang on to the memory of that night. \"I actually kept the red carpet dress I wore at the Oscars —this black dress when I was pregnant—for her just so she could have that, because I thought that's neat, that she wasn't born yet but she went to the Oscars,\" Dewan Tatum shared. Everly, who was born in May 2013, has a different favorite, though, when it comes to her mother's awards show looks. \"There was this blue sequined Zuhair [Murad] dress I wore to Globes, I think last year, and when I put that on it was like I was Elsa [from Frozen ] to her, and that was pretty cool,\" Dewan Tatum shared. One thing is for certain: Everly has one stylish mama to look up to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:21:38.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
