Later he suspected that he might have handed over the phone to his friends. \n\nChaggan summoned Bablu, 15, Dashrath, 12, Sonu, 9, Hemraj, 13 and Sandeep, 8, and questioned them about the loss of mobile phone. \n\nLater, he tricked them into playing a game. He asked them to dip their hands in hot oil and assured them that only the one, who had stolen the mobile, will get hurt; others will remain unscathed. \n\nTrusting the man, the children dipped their hands in the hot oil. \n\nBablu, Dashrath and Sonu sustained serious burns and were rushed to a hospital in Raoti for treatment. Hemraj and Sandeep were also treated for burns at the hospital. \n\nReoti police station in-charge RS Rathore said he received a call around midnight that the children had been admitted in the hospital. \n\n\"Their condition was not good. They are undergoing treatment,\" he said. \n\nChaggan was arrested from neighbouring village by a team of police on Tuesday morning. A case was registered under relevant sections against him, Rathore said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:53:41.883+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
