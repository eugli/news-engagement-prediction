Now it's made it a lot more difficult.\" \nIncident commander Richard McNamara said it was \"like spitting on a barbecue\". MetService \nMetService national forecast for the weekend includes welcome showers, though not heavy rain, for the Port Hills. \n\"We don't need it to be honest. We could have done with it in three days time.\" Ad Feedback \nWinds were forecast to pick up on Friday afternoon and there was still extreme heat in the ground and in vegetation, which posed a \"very real risk\" of flare-ups, Civil Defence said shortly before midday on Friday. \nMetService forecaster Aidan Pyselman said with the north to northeast flow over the area, cloud should thicken and patchy drizzle was expected. JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nResidents passing through a cordon on Kennedys Bush Rd. \n\"We're hoping for a bit more rain from earlier tomorrow morning, with the stuff over the North Island at the moment slowly sinking southwards.\" \nSMOKE AND HEAT DAMAGE RISK \nHundreds of homes near Christchurch's Port Hills may be at risk of fire damage, even if they are spared from flames sweeping through the area. BEVAN READ & TONY WALL \nHot spots are being dampened using pool water within the fire zone. \nPolice expected \"a large number of homes\" in the area would have been damaged by the smoke and heat, if not the fire itself, Civil Defence said. \n\"The number of damaged homes in total will not be known until the fire emergency has ended.\" \nCivil Defence was unable to give any information about the status of individual homes inside the fire zone. JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nEvacuated residents may soon be allowed home. \n\"We are aware that this is an extremely anxious time for residents who have had to leave their homes and we are working with other agencies to arrange for this information to be passed on to homeowners in the affected areas as soon as the information becomes available.\" \nCORDONS LIFTED TO 1400 \nThe cordons at the corner of Early Valley Road and Old Tai Tapu Road and at the corner of Osterholts Road and Old Tai Tapu Road was lifted on Friday afternoon. JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nFirefighters regroup to battle the Port Hills blazes. \nMuch of Westmorland has now reopened and with the earlier lifting of the cordon at the corner of Cashmere Road and Penruddock Rise (accessible only from the east) and there are now no cordons on Old Tai Tapu Road. \nCordons can be lifted only after full risk assessments have been completed, including asbestos and geotechnical hazards, but lifting all of them was a high priority, Civil Defence said on Friday afternoon. \nRemaining cordons were controlled by Civil Defence, but manned by police and Defence Force personnel, with assistance from visiting US Coastguard personnel. MORNING REPORT/RNZ \nAn Air Force Hercules is expected back in Christchurch today after flying to Australia to pick up supplies to fight the Port Hills fire. \n\"We are providing reassurance to residents about evacuation, but also to others that we are keeping a watchful eye on their property,\" Superintendent John Price said. \nAgencies were also developing a process for residents, whose homes have suffered severe or total damage, to visit their property to retrieve items and care for pets and livestock. \nPolice were also checking on the safety of contractors working on the fire, and urged members of the public to keep away from the hills. HENRY COOKE/FAIRFAX NZ \nDrizzle was falling in Christchurch on Friday morning, and people were hpeful it would dampen fires in the Port Hills. \nRubber-neckers were disrupting the emergency response and making it harder for police and fire services to do their jobs, Price said. \nThe Te Hapua Halswell Centre remained open as an evacuation centre on Friday, while two others, at Nga Hau E Wha Marae and in Selwyn, had closed. \nCOPING ISN'T EASY MORNING REPORT/RNZ \nCanterbury's Chamber of Commerce keen to make clear Christchurch city is still open for business despite the raging Port Hills fire. \nChristchurch might be slowly returning to normal, but health professionals are warning that the impact of disaster could go on for a long time. \nExperience and research suggested those who had been hyped up on adrenalin during the fires could feel shaky, queasy, on-edge, and find it hard to concentrate on the days after, All Right? manager Sue Turner said. \nAnger and crying was normal, with ways to de-stress including light physical activity, taking up a small chore or focusing on calm breathing for 10 seconds. Breakfast \nActing Defence Minister Gerry Brownlee talks about his concerns over the response to the Christchurch fires. \n\"You need to pace yourself. Go slow and steady, and look after yourself.\" \nThe best advice Turner had for anyone experiencing issues was to phone their GP. After hours they would be put through to a 24/7 nurse. \nThe Canterbury Earthquake Support Line was also still available for people to access on 0800 777 846 Fairfax NZ \nThe Port Hills fires are some of the biggest in recent New Zealand history. \nA BLAZE LIKE NO OTHER \nCivil Defence's Christchurch controller, John Mackie, described the blaze as \"beyond anything we've ever had to deal with\". \nThe fire was largely contained but not yet under control, but the firefighting effort was shifting from air-based to ground-based firefighting. MORNING REPORT/RNZ \n\"It's encouraging isn't it? You come out here and they're having a chat to you and they're still smiling\". Guyon Espiner catches up with incident controller Rob Hands last night while some of the firefighters were having a much needed meal break. \n\"Water drops won't put the fire out completely so we have to back that up with the heavy machinery to put fire breaks in and dig out the hot spots. That's where a lot of our focus is today with diggers working at several locations, along with 15 helicopters and three fixed wing aircraft,\" Civil Defence said. \nIn areas that diggers could not access to create fire breaks, fire retardant would be dropped to stop the fire's spread. \nFifteen tonnes of flame retardant would arrive on Friday afternoon aboard a Defence Force Hercules C130. NZN VIDEO \nPrime Minister Bill English says the Port Hills fire looks like arson \"to someone like him\" \nMackie said it would be a great help to fire crews. \n\"There are wetting agents that break down the surface tension of the water droplets so they're much more effective . . . it makes a litre of water go a lot further than it might otherwise. \n\"We've never needed it in such quantities. This is an event that's beyond anything we've ever had to deal with . . . especially on a city fringe. \n\"Two thousand hectares is quite a rarity and this is one out of the box. We've had a run of bad luck, that's for sure.\" \nCOMMUNICATION ISSUES \nMackie said Civil Defence was relying on people to follow media reports and social media for information about when they would be able to return to their homes. \n\"We don't have things like individual cell phone numbers . . . We should have a better handle on [timeframes for people being able to return home] closer toward the end of [Friday]. \nCriticism regarding the emergency response would be addressed later, Mackie said. \n\"We're really focusing on getting this thing dealt with. The structures and the systems we currently have in place, they may not be ideal but there's a lot of people working hard out there. \n\"Criticism doesn't help engagement of those volunteers who have put in huge hours in the last four-five days and it's not their day job.\" \nThere had also been \"a lot of speculation\" on the cause of the fires, but \"there's nothing definite yet\". \nInvestigators had begun work to identify the cause, he said. \nTHREE HOSPITALISED \nThree people had been taken to Christchurch Hospital with injuries related to the fire – two with smoke inhalation, and the third with an injury suffered while evacuating. \nA spokeswoman for the Christchurch District Health Board said a female firefighter was having trouble breathing after suffering smoke inhalation but was \"fine\" after treatment. \nA 9-year-old boy was also admitted with asthma \"exacerbated by the smoke\", while a man was admitted after injuring his ankle while evacuating his property. \nFIRE BAN, AREAS OUT OF BOUNDS \nThere was a total fire ban in place in North and Canterbury, and fire region manager Steve Turek said it was important no fires were lit to ensure the Fire Service could concentrate its efforts on the Port Hills. \nEmergency services were preparing to continue their operations for the weekend, if not longer, with their priority keeping the major blaze away from people and property. \nCivil Defence recommended no recreational activities, such as camping, cycling or picnics, within an area where it warned the fire and smoke could spread. \nThe yellow line boundary shows where further fire spread and smoke could pose a risk and cause health concerns. \nNon-residents were urged to stay away from the area to allow access for emergency services. \nResidents within the zone who had not already been evacuated were not affected. \nIf further evacuations were required, those would be led by Civil Defence, but anyone who felt unsafe or anxious was advised to self-evacuate. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T10:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:15:29.708+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
