Article continues below \nThis season, though, Rashford has found first team opportunities much tougher to come by under Jose Mourinho and it has been reflected in his goal record. \nIn rotation with the likes of Anthony Martial, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Juan Mata, Rashford has made 31 appearances so far this term but scored just six times. Article continues below Video: Twitter absolutely loves what Pep Guardiola said to Arter at full-time \nIn fact, his last goal in the Premier League came against Leicester in September. \nHe did grab a brace in the FA Cup victory over Reading last month but it is safe to say the young England international has struggled to live up to the expectations set by last season. \nOf course, it might be a little harsh to judge his campaign on goals, given he has spent most of the year on the left flank and many of those appearances have come off the bench. \nBut according to The Times , Rashford's lack of playing time is beginning to play on his mind somewhat. \nOn Tuesday's back page, the paper claim he is stalling on signing a new contract at Old Trafford and will even consider his position at the club. \nRashford reportedly harbours concerns that he may never be given a regular run in the team but does not want to leave. \nThe teen only signed a new deal at the end of the last season and doesn't expire until 2020. Therefore some may be surprised to hear he is already being offered an extension less than 12 months later. \nMourinho only reserved special praise for Rashford last week - suggesting there are no problems in the pair's relationship - as he backed the goal-shy forward. \n\"I'm always happy with Marcus's contribution,\" Mourinho told the press . \n\"I know that last season [there was] no pressure. I know that last season, in front of the goal, the goal was bigger. I know that this season the expectation is higher, the pressure is higher and the goal is shorter and he is missing some chances. \n\"He doesn't score as many goals as he could because he has lots of playing time on the pitch but this is absolutely natural - the second year after a season of explosion and expectation, everything changes.\" \n\"He's not anymore the surprise kid, he's a player that everybody respects, that everybody knows, that everybody knows the qualities and it's normal that he's in this period of transition where he's still a kid but he's not anymore the new kid in town. \n\"So, I think next season will be very, very good for Marcus because this season is giving him a capital of experience at this level of responsibility, at this level of being a professional player for a club like Manchester United. So I'm really happy with Marcus. \" \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
