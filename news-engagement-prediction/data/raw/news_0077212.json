Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nWhat happened after Shannon Matthews was returned home and her mum Karen was sent to jail? \nAnd what happened to Karen's friendship with Julie Bushby? \nThe disappearance of the nine-year-old girl, in 2008, became a world-wide story when it was uncovered that her mother knew where she was all along. \nBut what Karen did is something Julie says she can never \"forgive\" or condone\". \nShe said: \"I don’t support her as a friend, because I can’t… I haven’t had any contact with Karen for five years, because probation told me I had to stay away from her. They let me go see her once a month, every month for four years, and then they stopped it. Yeah, I know what she did were wrong, but at the end of the day, to me she’s like a child.

I don’t condone what she did at all. \n\"But I don’t know, it’s hard to explain. Life’s too short to hold grudges for the rest of your life. Karen… Karen’s got nobody. Yeah, everybody says she deserves nobody. She deserves to have a sad life, she deserves to have mushy peas poured over her head, etcetera, etcetera. There’s worse people out there than her, and for some reason the press seem to think it’s a barrel of fun chasing her down all the time.\" \nAll eyes were on the Moorside estate in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, as residents came together to search for young Shannon, only for her to be found 24 days later, less than a mile from her house, at the home of Michael Donovan. Julie says Karen is \"like a child\" (Photo: Channel 5) But she can't forgive her (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nA recent dramatisation of the story was highly-praised after it appeared on BBC One, and now Channel 5 is examining what happened next. \nKaren's friend and neighbour Julie Bushby, who rallied the town to search for the youngster, speaks about what the case and her relationship with Karen in Shannon Matthews: What Happened Next. \nThe documentary examines Shannon’s kidnapping and why people close to the case believe the police should reopen their investigation. Featuring the insight of some of those closest to the case, the programme charts the impact on an innocent girl caught in the lies and greed of those who were supposed to be caring for her. \nIt reveals the repercussions for the community that came together to hunt for her, and how the story of one missing schoolgirl changed Britain. \nJulie, who was portrayed by Sheridan Smith on the Moorside, will reveal that she kept a diary every time she visited Karen in prison and that her friend would regularly change her story.
