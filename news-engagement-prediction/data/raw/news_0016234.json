Fortunately, it all worked out in the end, as World War Z earned decent reviews and collected $540 million worldwide. However, these issues obviously required that the blockbuster be delayed, and now that same fate has fallen on the sequel, because World War Z 2 was just taken off the schedule. \nParamount Pictures and Skydance Entertainment announced today that World War Z 2 will no longer be released on June 9. 2017. No new release date was announced, leaving it currently languishing in limbo. However, THR 's insiders stated that the studio is hoping to have World War Z 2 ready to go by 2018 or 2019. \nTo the casual observer, removing World War Z 2 off its release date only five months beforehand might seem like a weird movie. However, if you've been paying attention to the sequel's troubled journey, this decision actually makes perfect sense. Paramount announced that World War Z would receive a sequel shortly after the movie was a hit at the box office, and nowadays it's common to attach a release date to a project long before filming begins. However, at the beginning of 2016, director J.A. Bayona (who was succeeding Marc Forster) had to leave World War Z 2 after being attached since December 2013 due to \"other commitments.\" Bayona was later tapped to helm Jurassic World 2 . Anyway, since then there's barely been any word on how World War Z 2 is coming along. As of August 2016, the blockbuster hadn't even begun production, and although David Fincher was being looked at to replace Bayona, there's still no official confirmation on who the new director will be. \nYeah, this delay is certainly warranted. Even moving at a frantic pace, there was no way Paramount was ever going to make that June release date. So if you were a fan of the first World War Z and its hectic take on a zombie pandemic, you'll just have to hang in there a little longer, as the sequel is still at least a year or two away. As it stands now, the only confirmed news regarding World War Z 2 outside of this date shift is that Brad Pitt will reprise main protagonist Gerry Lane for more mindless horde excitement. \nWe'll keep you updated on how World War Z 2 is progressing as more updates come in, but in the meantime, click here to find out what other movies are coming out across 2017, including Paramount features like Ghost in the Shell , Baywatch and Transformers: The Last Knight .
