But that soon changed. \n\"When I fell pregnant with our first child, Adam started drinking. Before that, he hadn't really drunk much,\" Ms Banks told A Current Affair . \n\"It was like stepping on eggshells. You wouldn't know what you were coming home to, what he's going to be like, what mood he's going to be in, if he's going to be volatile or if he's going to be the happy, loving Adam.\" Ms Banks said everything was good when she first met Adam Farnsworth. But then he started drinking and becoming abusive (Source: A Current Affair) \nMs Banks says she stayed with Farnsworth longer than she should have in an attempt to make things work. \n\"I just thought that I could help him and he would stop. But he didn't,\" she said. \nEventually, Ms Banks fled. But not before documenting her abuse at the hands of the man who claimed to love her. \n\"I was really frightened. I thought I was going to die. He was telling me he was going to kill me. I feared for my life,\" she said. \nMs Banks cut all ties with Farnsworth, but she claims he continues messaging her. She claims he damaged her and her aunt's cars one night after questioning her about who had parked in her driveway (Source: A Current Affair) \nOn one occasion, he asked whose car was parked outside her house one night. It belonged to her aunt. \n\"At 1am in the morning, he came around and smashed our cars and cut our brakelines. Mine and my aunties,\" Ms Banks said. \nFarnsworth denied doing it. \n\"A couple of months after that, I have a new car and I was getting it serviced and the mechanic actually found a tracking device under the back wheel of the vehicle and it was traced back to him. The SIM card was traced back to him,\" Ms Banks said. \n\"He's also done things, like I'm sitting on the lounge watching TV and I'll see him outside my window. He's just looking in and when he sees I've seen him, he starts running away.\" Farnsworth has been handed a five-year restraining order (Source: A Current Affair) \nMs Banks also says messages directed at her were painted on her street. \n\"Driving down my street and it was just here at the entrance to my street, painted in white, and I saw the words 'I love Dew', and I knew straight away it was him because that is what we used to say to one another,\" she said. \nFarnsworth eventually pleaded guilty to stalking Ms Banks and was sentenced to six months jail, suspended for 12 months. \n\"I thought this time he would be getting some jail time and then I started to get scared thinking he's still out there,\" Ms Banks said. \n\"I think the next thing I thought of is 'when am I going to be next? When am I going to be on the news for being killed?'\" \nA five-year restraining order was placed on Farnsworth, who told A Current Affair that he now lives in another state and has no plans to return to where Ms Banks lives.
