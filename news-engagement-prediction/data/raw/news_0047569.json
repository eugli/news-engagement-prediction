Credit: Bobby Bank/Getty All Stories \nDavid Cassidy , known for hit singles in the early Seventies as well as his role on the sitcom The Partridge Family , said on Monday that he was struggling with dementia, Reuters reports . Both his grandfather and his mother suffered from the disease. \"I was in denial, but a part of me always knew this was coming,\" the 66-year-old told People .

According to Reuters , concertgoers also captured video of Cassidy appearing to fall off the side of a low stage. The singer now plans to stop touring. \"I want to focus on what I am, who I am and how I've been without any distractions,\" he told People . \"I want to love. I want to enjoy life.\" \nCassidy repeatedly cracked the top 40 in the U.S. in the early Seventies, landing hits like \"Cherish\" and \"How Can I Be Sure.\" He continued to enjoy success in the U.K. after his stateside popularity waned, and he sneaked back to No. 27 on the American charts in 1990 with \"Lyin to Myself.\" \nRecently, his personal life was the subject of more headlines than his music. Cassidy was charged with driving under the influence in 2010, 2013 and 2014, when he spent some time in rehab. The next year, he filed for bankruptcy and was charged with a hit-and-run after leaving the scene of an accident. Cassidy was scheduled to perform at the B.B. Kings Blues Club & Grill in New York City on March 4th.
