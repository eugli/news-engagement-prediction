By Pragati Ratti Sharma  13 AM IST Comments Mahashivratri \nCoimbatore, Feb 24: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Friday unveil a 112-feet tall statue of Lord Shiva in Coimbatore on the occasion of Mahashivratri. According to reports, the statue, dedicated to Adiyogi (a form of Lord Shiva who according to the Hindu tradition is considered to be the first of yogis) has been funded by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev’s Isha Foundation. \nPM Modi began the day with extending good wishes to the people of the country on the occasion of Mahashivratri.He is scheduled to arrive at 5.30 PM at Sulur airport and then leave for the venue, which is 25 km from Coimbatore, by a helicopter. महाशिवरात्रि के इस पावन पर्व पर देशवासियों को हार्दिक शुभकामनाएं। \n— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) February 24, 2017 \nAccording to a PTI report, a five-tier security blanket is in place in and around Coimbatore and also the Tamil Nadu-Kerala border in view of event. With the venue being on the Western Ghats and also close to the mountain ranges in Kerala, additional police personnel have been reportedly deployed along the state borders to prevent possible infiltration of extremists and Maoists, said the police. \nMeanwhile there are also protests in the area against the statue. Tribal associations in the region have alleged that the statue lacked approvals and that the construction was not approved by the Hill Area Conservation Authority. \nSecurity has also been tightened in view of planned protests by human rights organisations, various political parties, farmers and tribal bodies, alleging that Adiyogi’s face was built on encroached land and that Modi’s visit would only regularise it (land). \nIn Chennai, the CPI(M) and CPI have pointed to various alleged violations in setting up of the statue and said that the Prime Minister should not visit the venue. \nAbout the statue \nAccording to reports, the statue weighs 500 tonnes and is made of steel. A Financial Express report states that while it took 2.5 years for the team to design the statue, it was built in about eight months. \nAccording to the report, the statue is 112-feet tall as Adiyogi opened up 112 possibilities for human beings to reach their ultimate potential. The report says that there is also a scientific significance as there are 112 chakras in the human system, with which one can work to explore 112 dimensions of life.  13 AM IST comment Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T05:57:34.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
