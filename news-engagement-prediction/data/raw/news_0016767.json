I've been living like this for four years and I can't do it anymore',\" she said. \nAnother man told her he had been on the streets for 33 years. \nMs Heaslip said the people she met were supportive of her project. \n\"Time after time it was [them saying] 'thank you, people don't see us',\" she said.
