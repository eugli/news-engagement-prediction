He said yes when others were saying no.” Remembering Mike Ilitch Chris Ilitch now in charge of dad's empire under succession plan \nIlitch's $7-million rehabilitation of the Fox in 1988 didn’t just restore the grand old venue’s opulence — it kick-started a stretch of downtown now teeming with concerts, shows and other nightlife attractions, busy enough that detailed traffic advisories are regularly issued for incoming audiences. \n“He was a true visionary, just as great a Detroiter as we've ever had,” said Franks. “He's done more for the city than anyone up to this day.” \nIlitch had gotten a toehold in show business with his purchase of the Detroit Red Wings in 1982, when he simultaneously bought Olympia Stadium Corp. to manage Joe Louis and Cobo arenas. \nRenamed Olympia Entertainment in 1996 and initially headed by his musician son, Atanas Ilitch, the company would oversee a swath of downtown activity including the Fox, Comerica Park, the Hockeytown Cafe, Sound Board and Second City Detroit, whose comedy roster boasted names such as Keegan-Michael Key. (The 200-seat venue, housed in the Hockeytown complex, is now known as City Theatre.) Additionally, the Ilitch organization spearheaded the opening of restaurants such as America's Pizza Cafe, Johnny Rockets, Foxtown Grille and Hard Rock Cafe's Detroit franchise. \nOlympia also manages Little Caesars Arena, the new Red Wings and Pistons home that’s set to become the region’s leading concert arena as part of a merger with Palace Sports & Entertainment. The venue will open in September with a six-show Kid Rock run. \nLittle Caesars Arena is the centerpiece of the emerging District Detroit, a $1.2-billion, 50-block project envisioned by the Ilitches as a walkable restaurant, bar, retail and residential sector.

(Photo: Elaine Cromie, Detroit Free Press) \nThere were few full-time entertainment destinations downtown when the billionaire and his wife, Marian Ilitch, set their eyes on the Fox. Their investment was a show of confidence in Detroit, helping coax skittish suburbanites to visit and paving the way for other developers to commit. \n“Mr. Ilitch was very interested in the entertainment world and how it could be a factor in helping revitalization,” said David DiChiera, founding general director of Michigan Opera Theatre. “People really weren't coming downtown, so it was important to put that stake down to say, ‘Look, if you want to see this entertainment, you've got to come here.’ It would have been much easier to just bring things up to the suburbs. But this is where this kind of entertainment belongs, and it helps make sure a city center is thriving and inviting.” \nToday, the Fox is at the heart of a humming entertainment zone that includes two stadiums, the new arena, a host of restaurants and at least a dozen theaters, including the Fillmore Detroit, Music Hall, the Gem Theatre, City Theatre and the Detroit Opera House, opened by DiChiera in 1996. \n“There's nothing like it on the planet that I've been around,” said Vince Paul, president and artistic director of Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts, which was among the lone downtown venues when Ilitch took over the Fox. \nComerica Park, opened by Olympia in 2000, has hosted acts such as the Rolling Stones, Eminem and Bruce Springsteen. The adjacent Ford Field, which was opened by the Lions organization two years later, has featured Taylor Swift, Beyoncé and others. \nUnder the Ilitches’ helm, the Fox has consistently ranked among the country’s top 10 theaters, based on annual ticket sales data compiled by the trade magazine Pollstar. \n“He was the for-profit arm of entertainment in Detroit, and I was the nonprofit arm, and together we created rather vital activity in the city that helped bring people downtown,” said DiChiera. “I don't think we can underestimate how important the Ilitches were to Detroit during the years when there wasn't a lot happening. I'd have been very lonely down here otherwise.” \nIlitch’s downtown forays were met by early skepticism in some quarters. As he scooped up — and held onto — nearby properties, including other abandoned theaters, the area was snarkily dubbed “Ilitchville” by the likes of Orbit magazine. For some in the entertainment community, his approach in those days was viewed as protective and exclusionary.

(Photo: Salwan Georges, Detroit Free Press) \nThe new District Detroit project represents “philosophical baby steps” on that front, said Music Hall’s Paul — a sign that the Ilitch camp is “reaching out and saying it’s OK not to own every entity there, that there’s enough to go around for everybody.” \n“The insular, unilateral approach may have been appropriate in the 1980s and '90s, but now this city is entering a different phase, and there's lots of different people coming in to mine that economy,” he said. \nStill, there's no doubt the 1988 theater restoration was a passion project for the magnate, who moved Little Caesars’ headquarters from Farmington Hills to the Fox building a year later. \n\"When you're making a pizza, you're just touching someone who's hungry. In sports, you want to win,” he told the Free Press at the time. “Here, it's like you're opening up your home to the city.\" \nContact Brian McCollum: 313-223-4450 or bmccollum@freepress.com. 19 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:12:47.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
