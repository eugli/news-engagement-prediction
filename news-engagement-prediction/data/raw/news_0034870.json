Michelle has hidden the fact that he is her younger lover and the pair have sneakily been stealing passionate moments together. \nBut when Michelle’s past scuppered her chances of a teaching role, reality hit home and Michelle told Preston that he would have to go home. (Picture: BBC) \nPreston was less than impressed and, as he stormed out after making sacrifices to be with Michelle, a passing Louise Mitchell suggested to Bex that she could move on from Shakil Kazemi by pursuing a romance with Preston. \nHurting from being ditched by Michelle, will Preston respond to advances from Bex? And, if so, how might Michelle react? \nEastEnders continues on Friday 17th February at 8pm on BBC One.
