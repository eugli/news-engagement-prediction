Do not do that.’ \nBut I read on, hoping, desperately, that this spa was just using an exciting subject line to get people interested, and was not seriously proposing that people freeze their bits to improve their sex lives. \nI was wrong. \nThe Ainscow Spa is seriously offering people a new unisex treatment called ‘Love Mist’. \n‘Love Mist’ involves blasting minus 160 degree vapour over the genital area using a liquid nitrogen tank for thirty minutes. So essentially, it’s freezing your downstairs area. For fun. Picture: The Ainscow Spa) \nThe spa claims that when the sub-zero temperatures cover the skin, the sudden drop in heat increases the flow of blood and sends endorphins shooting around the body, generating a natural high. \nThis bit is probably true. Just like jumping in an icy cold lake makes you feel very awake and alive, freezing your sensitive areas will likely do the same thing. \nIt’s their next claim that’s suspect. \n‘While the skin continues to feel the freeze the body sends signals back and forth the the brain,’ say the spa. \n‘These messengers tell the brain if there is damage to the tissues, to repair them. (Picture: The Ainscow Spa) \n‘It’s this that along with the instant endorphin level energy boost and natural high, generates a tighter, youthful, clear, and vibrant genital skin appearance through boosting collagen.’ \nThe spa goes on to suggest that the treatment will increase the sex drive and make sex generally brilliant. \nNow, I have a lot of issues with this. \nFirst of all, I bristle at any treatment suggesting that women need to make their vaginas ‘tighter’ or ‘more youthful’, because Jesus Christ I could really do with not getting even more pressure to make my vagina tighter than a test tube just because people think that’s the best way to give someone sexual pleasure. \nI’m also not a fan of any new treatment that suggests that people in any way need to spend money to make their genitals shiny and new. (Picture: Metro / Getty Images) \nA reminder – the vagina is self-cleaning, self-managing, and will generally be fine if you leave it to do its thing. The vagina does not need detox pills , it does not need tightening sticks , and it does not need rejuvenation surgery to make it ‘more youthful’ or slice of any sign of labia. \nBut on a separate and equally important note, this treatment won’t actually do what it’s claiming to do in any way, shape, or form. \nNot only will it not improve your sex life, other than giving you a short-term endorphin boost (which you could also achieve by going for a run), but it could actually end up lessening your sexual pleasure. \nOn her blog , Dr Jen Gunter explains that as a gynaecologist, she often uses cryotherapy on the genitals – but not to increase sexual pleasure. (Picture: Metro.co.uk) \n‘When exposed to temperatures of – 20 degrees C or less for a minute or more cells undergo cryonecrosis, i.e. they are killed by the cold,’ explains Jen, noting that cryonecrosis can cause thermal shock, vascular stasis, dehydration, and denuration of proteins. \n‘This does not make me thing of rocking good orgasms,’ says Jen. \n‘It makes me think of sloughing tissue, unnatural redness, a big nasty scab, a horrendous vaginal discharge, and delicate new skin. And frostbite, it makes me think of that as well.’ \nEssentially, freezing your bits will damage tissue and kill of cells, leaving new tissue beneath. \nThis is probably where the spa is getting the ‘rejuvenation’ angle from. But freezing the penis or vagina doesn’t just magically remove old skin and reveal sparkly new parts underneath. \nIt’s painful. It causes damage. It absolutely does not bring pleasure. (Picture: metro.co.uk) \nAnd, as Jen Gunter explains, while the skin underneath may be shiny and new, it will also not be as stretchy. Which is a very, very bad thing when it comes to having enjoyable sex. \nFreezing the genitals for such a long period of time (30 minutes) will reduce blood flow and make the genitals less sensitive, likely reducing sexual pleasure. \n‘I’ve seen the effects of too much liquid nitrogen on normal genitals,’ says Jen. \n‘It’s not pretty and no one ever said it improved their sex lives. The idea that exposing genitals to temperatures of –160 C for 30 minutes is absolutely ridiculous.
