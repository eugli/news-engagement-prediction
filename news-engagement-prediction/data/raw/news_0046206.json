Neither man was wearing a seatbelt. \nMonica Marie Aker, a cousin of the younger Brasher, told People.com: \"Austin did drink and was coming home from partying when they crashed.\" \nThe father and son - who both lived in Bankston, about 67 miles (107km) west of Birmingham - were said by relatives to be very close.
