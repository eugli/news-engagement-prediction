But it seems the Little Mix star has put her heartache to one side and moved on with TOWIE star Chris Clark , who escorted her to the Brit Awards on Wednesday night. Cuddling up together for a picture, Jesy appeared to be on cloud nine. \"I don't want this girl to go back America tomorrow,\" the TV hunk cryptically wrote on Instagram.

Jesy had another reason to be happy on the night as Little Mix picked up the Best Single award for their chart-topping hit Shout Out To My Ex . Fellow bandmate Jade Thirlwall paid tribute to all their exes as they accepted the gong, telling the crowd: \"Thank you so much. We honestly didn't think we were going to get it, we were just sat there chin-wagging. We'd like to thank our label Sony, Syco, Simon [Cowell], our amazing A&R, our management, and us girls, because if it wasn't for our friendship, we wouldn't still be going. And lastly cheers to our exes for helping us to do an amazing song, this one's for you lads.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:04:47.817+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
