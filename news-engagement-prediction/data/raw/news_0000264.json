As it happened: AUG 26, 2016 : Mine contractors to receive partial debt payout, with former employee entitlements already met MAR 28, 2016 : Shipments of stockpiled ore will cover redundant Bootu Creek mine worker entitlements worth $4.5 million JAN 8, 2016 : Entitlements for 140 redundant workers from Northern Territory's Bootu Creek mine in limbo JAN 5, 2016 : Low prices push Bootu Creek mine operator OM Manganese into voluntary administration DEC 15, 2015 : Bootu Creek manganese mine in Northern Territory suspends operations DEC 10, 2015 : Future of Northern Territory's Bootu Creek manganese mine unclear \nThree mining crews have now been hired, consisting of both former and new staff, and there is a positive mood among those on site. \nThe Northern Territory Department of Resources has approved a revised mining management plan for operation. \nDeputy chief executive Rod Applegate said the department ensured the company met any environmental concern before giving it the green light to recommence mining. \n\"Late in 2016, apparently the manganese price must have increased globally and so they were looking to recommence the mine,\" Mr Applegate said. \n\"Their existing mine authorisation existed, granted originally, but they had to come up with a new mine management plan under the Act. \n\"We had officers go on site and have a look at the site and I think in early December the department approved the mine management plan.\" \nWhile the amounts of environmental mining bonds held by the NT Government are usually kept confidential — a policy currently under review — the department holds around $9.75 million in relation to Bootu Creek. \nMr Applegate could not confirm the exact figure but said the size of the bond may be revised depending on the new management plan. \n\"[OM Manganese] is in care and maintenance, so they have responsibility under the Act, under their title to look after the site,\" he said. \n\"Our security bond is largely available for government when a company goes to the wall and disappears and we have to go in and fix, presumably, any mess that was left behind.\" \nABC Rural has contacted OM Manganese for comment. \nChairman of the Regional Economic Development Committee in Tennant Creek Greg Marlow says around 20 workers from the town, who were laid off from the mine in 2015, have returned to work for OM Manganese. \n\"There are quite a few [locals] who have signed contracts to go back to work with OM Manganese,\" he said. \n\"My understanding is that some of the fly-in-fly-out workers have commenced coming into town to be relayed out to the mine.\" \nMr Marlow said the re-hiring of local workers would be a boost for Tennant Creek. \n\"Because they live in town, that means the money stays in town and gets spent in town, that raises the economic development around the town itself,\" he said. \n\"For sub-contractor's point of view, with the mine operating there is going to be repair work required, so the tradies will have a bit more work on their plate.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T10:29:11.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
