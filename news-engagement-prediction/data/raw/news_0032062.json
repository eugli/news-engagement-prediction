We thought people would write ‘be mine’ or ‘true love’ on them,” she said. “One person wanted suggestive things on their doughnuts.”\nThe Blackbird staff loved the idea, so they started writing the messages themselves.\n“A good amount of last year’s Valentine’s Day was spent making trays of doughnuts with lude comments on them,” Roine said.\nRoine said the majority of doughnut orders this year are for sweet nothings, but naughty ones are coming in by the dozens, too. “We’ll write whatever you want, as long as it fits on a doughnut,” she said.\nwe are closed today but still taking v-day orders up until 6p. email us. orders@blackbirddoughnuts.com\nA photo posted by Blackbird Doughnuts (@blackbirddoughnuts) on Feb 13, 2017 at 8:20am PST\nAs for the Valentine’s display at the shop, Roine said they will decorate a doughnut with “XXX” written on it in case any children come in.\n“If you’re old enough, we’ll show you a tray and you can pick your message,” said Roine.\nThe Valentine’s Day doughnuts are available for order by the half ($20) and full dozen ($40). All kinds of doughnuts will be available for individual purchase for $3.\n(Blackbird Doughnuts, 492 Tremont St., Boston; blackbirddoughnuts.com )", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BQatE7ShoIg/?taken-by=blackbirddoughnuts", "https://www.blackbirddoughnuts.com/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQdVFZvBlYn/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQc6KG7hbEe/"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:17:27.954+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
