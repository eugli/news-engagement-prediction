Flynn, the national security adviser, left, on Friday. The White House has denied publicly that Mr. Flynn and a Russian ambassador had discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times President Trump said he plans to “look into” reports that his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, discussed sanctions in his pre-inauguration conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States and possibly misled administration officials about it. “I don’t know about that. I haven’t seen it,” said Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One late Friday, during a flight to Florida from Washington. Several news outlets reported on Thursday that Mr. Flynn and Ambassador Sergei I. Kislyak had discussed sanctions that the Obama administration had imposed on Russia. The White House has denied publicly that the two men discussed sanctions.

Perhaps a bigger concern for Mr. Flynn is his relationship with Vice President Mike Pence, who sometimes has had to defend him in public.

Mr. Pence repeated Mr. Flynn’s account during a television appearance. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The president still confers daily with Mr. Flynn, one of the few former military leaders to support him during the campaign. But three weeks into Mr. Trump’s presidency, Mr. Flynn’s role on national security matters has been challenged by other West Wing power players — including the president’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, and Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who have both taken expansive roles shaping foreign and defense policy. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, questioned on Friday whether Mr. Flynn should be allowed to stay in his job.
