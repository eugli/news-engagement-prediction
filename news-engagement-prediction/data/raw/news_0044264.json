Image copyright IFRC MENA Image caption The Red Crescent said the dead would be buried in a cemetery for unidentified people in Tripoli, Libya \nLibyan coast guard spokesman Ayoub Gassim said over 500 migrants were rescued at sea on Friday and Saturday near the city of Sabratha, to the west of Zawiya. \nThe boats were between five and seven miles (8-11km) from the coast of Libya. \nMr Gassim said the smugglers were now using larger rubber boats in order to pack more migrants in, some carrying up to 180 people. \nThe boats are weak, and loading them so heavily dramatically raises the risk of sinking. \n\"We are seeing the new boats, which are not equipped with anything, but they carry more people,\" he said. \n\"This is going to be even more disastrous to the migrants.\" \nA note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
