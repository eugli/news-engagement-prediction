Jong nam’s last words before he died - uttered in English to airport staff - were ‘very painful, very painful, I was sprayed liquid’.\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-Il (sitting-L) with his son, Kim Jong-Nam (Photo: AFP) Intelligence agencies in South Korea and the US insist it was a ‘hit’ carried out by North Korean tyrant Kim to protect his hold on power in the secretive communist state.\nAccording to China Press, his estranged half brother staggered 15m to a service counter after Monday’s attack at Kuala Lumpur airport in Malaysia.\nAfter that, he could only ‘grimace’ and ‘groan’. Staff on the fourth floor of the budget airline terminal then stopped policemen for help to take him to the airport clinic.\nHe lost consciousness and was immediately transferred to nearby Putrajaya Hospital.\nA North Korea official leaves the morgue at Kuala Lumpur General Hospital (Photo: REUTERS) But he died on the way, prompting speculation a deadly toxin such as ricin was used to poison him. No ‘puncture’ wounds were found on his body.\nJong-nam, the illegitimate playboy son of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-ill, received threats after he criticised the country’s regime in 2012, according to Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi.\nHe had been warned directly from North Korea to ‘refrain from talking politics.’ Jong-nam had also told him Kim Jong-un would not last as a leader and hereditary succession was a ‘joke’ to the outside world.\nKim Jong-un (Photo: Reuters) Malaysia police Special Branch director Datuk Seri Mohamad Fuzi Harun said they had ‘no reason’ to believe the murder was the work of foreign agents at this stage.\nBut he added: “There are definitely other individuals involved, apart from the two assailants.”\nAishah, from Indonesia, was said to be working in a Kuala Lumpur nightclub when she was approached by the mystery stranger.\nHer Malaysian boyfriend Muhammad Farid Bin Jalaluddin, 26, was also arrested over the death. The attack took just five seconds to carry out.\n Comments Show more comments More On Kim Jong-nam Kim Jong-un North Korea Murder", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1/4221396001_5327214220001_5327196751001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/279/4221396001_5327443519001_5327407700001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/993/4221396001_5327262505001_5327234651001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2887/4221396001_5327614914001_5327624158001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1505/4221396001_5327483394001_5327480943001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1239/4221396001_5326825239001_5326808696001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/961/4221396001_5326913168001_5326870067001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3479/4221396001_5326845758001_5326847364001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3655/4221396001_5327342953001_5327336646001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1846/4221396001_5322689072001_5322675208001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2601/4221396001_5327026388001_IPKG1487345297287I-thumb480x360.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3647/4221396001_5327609658001_5327569099001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMirror", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=DailyMirror", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/959/4221396001_5327428610001_5327424399001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/471/4221396001_5327075411001_5327071632001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://www.nst.com.my/news/2017/02/213393/police-identifying-4-n-korea-operatives-video", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1063/4221396001_5326859301001_5326843694001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/2233/4221396001_5326870376001_5326843722001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/17/4221396001_5327501409001_5327465073001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1433/4221396001_5327499861001_5327477770001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/1369/4221396001_5327583006001_5327567842001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3553/4221396001_5327549252001_5327524003001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001"], "published": "2017-02-18T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:02:01.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
