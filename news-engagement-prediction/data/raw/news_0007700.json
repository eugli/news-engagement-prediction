There was little room for experimentation from Mexico coach Juan Carlos Osorio when it came to naming his squad to face Iceland in Las Vegas on Feb. 8.\nThe Colombian manager is known for his tinkering, but approaching the midpoint of his likely stint in charge of Mexico, Osorio picked close to his strongest available squad for their first match of the year, with the obvious caveat that the Europe-based players aren't involved because it isn't a FIFA date.\nAny feeling that this match offered an opportunity to look at the younger generation with one eye on the Gold Cup was ignored by Osorio. And it is makes sense. July's Gold Cup is a lowly third on the list of priorities for Mexico in 2017. Osorio's responsibility is to qualify for the 2018 World Cup with room to breathe and prepare his side for a tricky Confederations Cup in June. With time on the training field scarce between now and this summer, Osorio will want to work with the players that could potentially impact the national team between now and then.\nThat sentiment is encapsulated by Rafa Marquez leading the team to Las Vegas. The days when his inclusion was constantly debated are temporarily over following his heroics in Columbus against the United States last November and all indications suggest he will continue to play an important role as preparations for Russia 2018 roll on. There is the argument that the 37-year-old could've been rested for what is very much a preparation match against Iceland, but the former Barcelona defender is only playing once every seven days for Atlas and Osorio is unlikely to play him for the full 90 minutes.\nGiovani dos Santos' inclusion is further evidence of Osorio's desire to keep the LA Galaxy forward in the national team's plans moving forward, and he will be vying for minutes on the wing with a strong group including Tigres' Jurgen Damm, Pachuca's Hirving Lozano, Pumas' Jesus Gallardo and Leon's Elias Hernandez.\nIn the goalkeeping department, it was Monterrey's Hugo Gonzalez who got the call to join the squad for the first time, but regulars Jesus Corona and Alfredo Talavera are also involved.\nIn defense, it's the same story, with Tigres duo Hugo Ayala and Jorge Torres Nilo, as well as Santos Laguna's Nestor Araujo. Although there was room for Chivas' left-footed center-back Oswaldo Alanis, who will surely start, Atlas' Luis Reyes, Pachuca's Raul Lopez and America's Edson Alvarez. Osorio will be looking to right-back Lopez and left-back Reyes to show him that they are ready for minutes, despite some people being surprised about their inclusion.\nAfter his heroics vs. the U.S. in November, Rafa Marquez returns to the Mexico squad. The midfield is the most stable part of the side. Jesus Molina and Jesus Duenas are longtime members of the Mexico squad; Orbelin Pineda and Erick Gutierrez are youngsters pushing for more minutes and Leon's Luis Montes is deserving of his recall after recapturing his form.\nThe central striker position is slightly worrying for Mexico due to the sheer lack of No. 9's playing regularly in Liga MX and Oribe Peralta not being available due to Club America's match against Chiapas. The call-up does offer Alan Pulido another opportunity and he needs to take it because aside from his Chivas teammate Angel Zaldivar there aren't really many other strikers that could be considered national-team quality at present.\nBut even with problems up front, you expect the quality within this Mexico squad to deal with Iceland without too many problems in Sin City.\nPredicated XI (4-3-3): Corona; Lopez, Araujo, Alanis, Torres Nilo; Marquez, Pineda, Gutierrez; Lozano, Gallardo, Pulido.\nThe surprising newcomers\nAlvarez: The 19-year-old was in shock at being called up and it does seem early after just nine Liga MX starts. That said, the ball-playing center-back, who can also shift into the holding midfield role, hasn't earned the nickname \"Beckenbauer\" for nothing. Alvarez looked perfectly at ease in important playoff matches last season for Club America and should have an important future.\nReyes: One year ago, the 25-year-old left-back was playing in the third tier of Mexican football. Reyes has shown consistency since earning the start for Atlas this Clausura and is set to be given a chance in a position Osorio has struggled to fill.\nGonzalez: There is little doubt about Gonzalez's quality and his ability in the air will have attracted Osorio. The key behind the 26-year-old Monterrey goalkeeper's call-up is that he now seems to be in place to regularly start for his club, opening the door to the national team.\nThe players omitted\nRodolfo Cota: The Chivas goalkeeper has been in superb form and combines a good aerial game with confidence when playing the ball out. He would appear to be ahead of Gonzalez in the pecking order if there was a World Cup tomorrow.\nCesar Montes: It is difficult to understand why Alvarez is in and Montes isn't. The Monterrey center-back is the same age as Alvarez, but has 51 Liga MX starts to his name and starred for Mexico at the 2014 Olympics.\nRodolfo Pizarro: The Chivas attacking midfielder appeared to be the furthest advanced of the new generation of El Tri potentials, but was left out while Lozano, Gutierrez and Pineda were included.\nTom Marshall covers Liga MX and the Mexican national team for ESPN FC.
