M T Dawn Kanchipuram, which was carrying 32,813 tonnes of Petroleum, Oil, & Lubricants, suffered a rupture which led to an oil spill . There was no casualty or injury to the crew members. \n\n3. Kamarajar Port had immediately deployed oil boom around the vessel to contain seepage, if any. After examination, the damaged vessel was towed safely and berthed at Kamarajar Port on January 30 to prevent any further possibility of oil spill. \n\n4. As soon as the oil leak was tracked, the Coast Guard started mobilizing equipment and manpower for clean-up at various locations and coordinated these operations. Groups were formed and cleaning work was undertaken at different places of the shoreline. \n\n5.
