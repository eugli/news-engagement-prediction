Their mother says they have since been having nightmares. \nThe local council has accepted the children were discriminated against. \nCentral Bedfordshire Council has agreed to pay an undisclosed sum in compensation. \nSpeaking to the BBC, the boys' mother, who has asked to remain anonymous in order to protect the identity of her children, told how she was called in to school and spent a couple of hours waiting for her children. \nLIVE: For more on this and other Bedfordshire stories \nThe mother, who is of Indian Hindu heritage, was told one of the boys had been speaking Arabic and talked about attending a mosque, yet she said none of the family spoke Arabic and the children did not go to mosques. \nThe guns they owned were bright green and orange and made from plastic. \n\"I was told they had displayed signs that were worrying in terms of being reasonable indicators of being involved in terrorist activity,\" she said. \n\"They had no other reason to believe they had any signs of extremism other than the colour of their skin. \n\"I understand that [terrorism] is a problem, but this is a rather blunt instrument with which to tackle it. \n\"There are some residual effects - both boys have suffering nightmares. My younger boy fears he might taken away. We are trying to help them move on.\" \nShe said she felt her family's reputation \"had been trashed\". \nThe school, which is understood to have called the police under the government's Prevent Strategy , would not comment on the case and instead referred the BBC to the local education authority, Central Bedfordshire Council.
