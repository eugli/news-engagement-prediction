A decision not taken lightly by the panel made up of a psychiatrist, a lawyer and a member of the public in Manitoba who concluded Li does not pose a significant threat to public safety. \n“If you were looking for a perfect record, this is a perfect record – showing remorse, showing compliance, showing insight, not having relapsed,” Chris Summerville said who is with the Schizophrenia Society of Canada and has worked with Li. \nREAD MORE: Tim McLean’s mother calls it ‘disturbing’ Vince Li granted absolute discharge \nStill, the decision to give Li a full discharge has sent shock waves across social media. Anger but also fear among Canadians who wonder what will happen now that Li is responsible for managing his medication and mental illness. \n“What happened was a horrific event and people are naturally going to be afraid of this,” O’Connor said. \nAccording to the Schizophrenia Society of Canada, three per cent of all criminal cases are committed by people with mental illness and one per cent of all offenders are found not criminally responsible. \nO’Connor also pointed out that there will be safeguards to protect the public. \n“If it really came down to a problem where he stopped being compliant then there are methods that he can actually be forced back into treatment,” O’Connor said. \n“It’s called a community treatment order –so he will be staying in touch with people and those that have been working with him will want to be keeping in touch with him as well to make sure that he’s keeping up with his treatment.” \nWhile there are no guarantees, Summerville said Li is motivated to continue taking his meds. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
