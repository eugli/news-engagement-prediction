Mariwan is separated from his wife and son, Arrow, because of President Donald Trump's immigration order. (Photo provided by Diamond DeDual.) \nDiamond DeDual is ashamed to be an American. \nThe 27-year-old hairstylist lives in Cuba, Mo. That’s Donald Trump country. Nearly 80 percent of voters in Crawford County voted for the nation’s new president in the November election. \nBut one of Trump’s first actions has been devastating to DeDual’s family. \nFour months ago, she and her husband, Mariwan, had their first child, Arrow. \nThanks to the president’s executive order barring immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. for at least four months, Diamond isn’t sure when she’s going to see her husband next, or when he will see his son. \nHe’s stuck in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, caught in a presidential crackdown on immigrants and refugees that is splitting American families. \n“I’m completely shocked that, as an American, I’m even having this conversation,” DeDual told me Wednesday. \nShe and Mariwan met in Rolla. \nHe was a student at Missouri University of Science and Technology , working on a master’s degree in petroleum engineering. Mariwan is Muslim in the way that a lot of St. Louisans are Catholic. It’s the faith of his father, but he doesn’t actively practice. He was in the country legally on an F-1 student visa. \nThe couple got married in Iraq in September 2015 and lived there for about a year. \n“Every single person I came in contact with was so friendly,” Diamond says of her time in Kurdistan. “They love Americans.” \nWhen she became pregnant, the couple decided Diamond should come back to Missouri to have the baby. The health care was better, and Mariwan’s job prospects would be, too. So they started a new visa process, this time applying for a spouse visa. \nThe case was approved by the U.S. Immigration and Citizenship Service, says their St. Louis-based attorney, Jim Hacking . It was forwarded to the National Visa Center. Mariwan went to the U.S. Embassy for the final step of the process, a personal interview. He left his passport with them and was supposed to get it back this week. \nThen Jan. 27 happened. Trump instituted a ban on immigrants entering the country if they came from seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq. His executive order also stopped Syrian refugees from entering the U.S . The order created chaos as various federal departments hadn’t been consulted and weren’t sure how to react when immigrants already flying to the U.S. landed at airports. The American Civil Liberties Union obtained a stay on a portion of the order, allowing those who had entered the country under legal visas to stay. \nBut that didn’t help the DeDuals. \nBefore Diamond flew back to Missouri, the couple sold most of their possessions to prepare for a new life together in the United States. Without his passport, however, Mariwan is now stuck, separated from his wife and son, unable to complete the immigration process in which he had already been vetted twice, once as a student, and again as a spouse of an American citizen. \n“He can’t go anywhere right now,” Diamond says of her husband. “He’s living on the floor with a teapot and a space heater.” \nThe nation’s immigration system was already broken, Hacking says. Now Trump has thrown it into “utter chaos.” \n“American citizens who are married to individuals from the seven Muslim countries are being denied the ability to bring their spouses to the U.S.,” Hacking says. “This is true despite months and months of processing and vetting by USCIS and the State Department. The procedures are already in place to check their criminal background, and they have to go through an interview. My citizen clients are being treated as second-class citizens with no individualized determination that their spouse did anything wrong. It’s not fair.” \nDiamond and Arrow are living with Diamond’s father. She talks to Mariwan by iPhone and Facebook. She waits, and watches her baby grow, and wonders how much of his early life his father will miss. \n“He wants to see his son,” Diamond says of Mariwan. “It’s not like he’s never been here before. He lived here for five years. He’s a good man, an educated man.” \nBut thanks to President Trump, he’s isolated from his American family, kept out of the U.S., because of the faith of his father. \n“I am absolutely ashamed of being an American right now,” Diamond says. “Nobody ever treated me this badly in a Muslim country.” +1 \nArrow DeDual.
