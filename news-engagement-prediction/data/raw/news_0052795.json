But fewer than two-thirds said other important standards of democracy were being met: no interference with the press and respect for judicial independence by elected branches of government. And a minority said the United States was succeeding at equal rights or basic behavioral norms of civil discourse. The survey was the first to be conducted by Bright Line Watch , a new project formed by four researchers — two from Dartmouth and one each from Yale and the University of Rochester — to study democratic performance in the United States after the 2016 election of Donald J. Trump, and to compare it with other countries. The researchers said the survey was devised to try to avoid political bias, although before the election three of them wrote an open letter saying Mr. Trump threatened democracy. \nAdvertisement   “Our concern is bringing academic expertise to the question, ‘How strong, or under threat, are basic institutions of American democracy?’ ” said Susan Stokes, a professor of political science at Yale and an organizer of Bright Line Watch. “That’s a nonpartisan question in the same sense that the Constitution is a nonpartisan document.” The fourth organizer, who did not sign the letter, is Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth and a contributor to The Upshot. Bright Line Watch conducted the survey by contacting 9,820 faculty members from 511 institutions represented at the American Political Science Association meeting. The project plans to survey the scholars quarterly, and The Upshot will follow the results. In their initial assessments of the health of United States democracy in February, the political scientists were measured, in contrast with the sense of alarm expressed by some left-leaning thinkers. “It reinforces the story that the U.S. is a high-functioning democracy,” Mr. Nyhan said. “It’s not perfect, but it has stronger and more resilient institutions than other countries that have had democratic backsliding or turns toward authoritarianism.” The survey asked political scientists to rate the importance of 19 characteristics of a democratic government, then rate how well the United States currently fares on each. The bulk of respondents said the United States fully or mostly met half of the democratic standards, and fell short on half. By far the most important element of democratic government, they said, was that elections are conducted and ballots counted without fraud or manipulation. This was also the element they thought the United States did best: 86 percent said the United States fully or mostly meets that standard. That assessment stands in sharp contrast to Mr. Trump’s unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud.
