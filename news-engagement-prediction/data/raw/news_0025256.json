The all-cash offer of $56.50 a share represents a 14 per cent premium to Zeltiq’s closing price on Friday. \nThe field of aesthetic medicine has become increasingly attractive to pharmaceutical groups because the vast majority of sales are made directly to consumers, who pay for the products in cash out of their own pockets. \nThat means drugmakers do not have to deal with cash-strapped healthcare systems, which are trying to push down the prices of medicines after years of above-inflation increases. \n“Medical aesthetics is probably one of the best and fastest growing businesses in the pharmaceutical arena,” said Brent Saunders, Allergan’s chief executive, on a call with analysts to discuss the deal. “Zeltiq is a very strong complementary fit to our existing medical aesthetics business and importantly increases our presence in the cash pay arena.” \nVamil Divan, analyst at Credit Suisse, said the deal would give “Allergan a stronger presence in the cash-pay business at a time when there are increasing concerns around drug prices and payer pressure”. \nLast week, Allergan reported that fourth-quarter sales of its facial fillers — which are used to plump up lips and remove fine lines — had increased to $237.8m, a 28 per cent increase compared with a year ago, while revenues from Botox grew 13.7 per cent to $793.3m. \nHowever, the company has had less success with Kybella, a fat-killing injection for double chins it acquired for $2.1bn in 2015. Sales of the treatment, which is heavily advertised on US television, have stagnated in recent months.
