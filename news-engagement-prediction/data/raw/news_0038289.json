But at least two possible cases of human-to-human transmission have been reported since September. \nOn the popular Chinese social-networking platform Weibo, many users expressed concern over the virus and paranoia over common-cold symptoms, while others said they were swearing off chicken. - AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T14:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T10:00:35.705+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
