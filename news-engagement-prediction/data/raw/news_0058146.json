Hours after shaking up their front office, the Lakers have dealt star sixth man Lou Williams to the Houston Rockets for Corey Brewer and a first-round pick, the Vertical reported. The Rockets are sending Corey Brewer and a first-round pick to the Lakers for Lou Williams, league source tells @TheVertical . \n— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 22, 2017 \nWilliams leads the Lakers in scoring at 18.6 points per game despite starting just one of the 58 games he’s played. This move comes as the Lakers reportedly are close to signing Rob Pelinka as their new general manager, one of just a number of front-office moves the franchise made Tuesday. \nMagic Johnson took over as president of basketball operations after the Lakers announced the firings of Mitch Kupchak as general manager and Jim Buss as executive vice president of basketball operations. \nBrewer has started just eight games this season and is averaging 4.2 points with the Rockets. \nWilliams reacted to the reported move. Thanx for the love L.A, I've enjoyed my stay. \n— Lou Williams (@TeamLou23) February 22, 2017 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:08:26.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
