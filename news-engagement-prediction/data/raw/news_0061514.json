The best way to view it is through a pinhole camera or with special solar viewing glasses. The geometry of the sun, moon and Earth changes with every eclipse. The moon's shadow will wander to different places each time but every point will have the chance to see a solar eclipse at some point in history. For those not able to view the eclipse from the ground this time there are a number of flights people can take to see it in all its glory. Alternatively you can live stream it online from the comfort of your own home. The next solar eclipse will be over the US on 21 August. WHY ARE THESE STUNNING COSMIC DISPLAYS SO RARE? They have often been seen as a sign of an impending apocalypse or the anger of the gods, but the real reason for the erratic occurrence of solar eclipses on Earth may finally have been solved. Researchers recently unravelled the mystery of why our Moon has a strange orbital tilt which causes it to pass between our planet and the Sun to cause an eclipse only occasionally. They claim the Moon was jostled into its current position through a series of close encounters with large lumps of debris left over from the formation of the inner planets 4.5 billion years ago. The satellites of most other planets tend to orbit in a path that is in line with the parent planet's equator. If the Moon orbited our own planet in a similar way, we would likely experience monthly solar eclipses as it passes between the Earth and the sun. However, the moon orbits at an angle of 5 degrees off the Earth's own orbital plane around the sun and spins on an axis that is actually tilted towards our own planet. This results in a far less regular solar eclipses.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T21:56:46.623+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
