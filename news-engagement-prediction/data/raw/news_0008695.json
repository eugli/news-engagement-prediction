Now, they’ve started shooting Anderson’s next feature, an untitled period drama set in 1950s London that focuses on a highly sought-after dressmaker who designed for the royals and British society (Vulture’s guess is that it’s about real-life capricious fashion designer Charles James). The movie, which has a title card reading Phantom Threads floating around online in some set photos , also brings Anderson back together with other longtime collaborators, including Oscar-winning costume designer Mark Bridges, who has worked on eight straight projects with the director, as well as composer Jonny Greenwood, who previously composed scores for There Will Be Blood , The Master , and Inherent Vice . We would now like to preemptively congratulate Daniel Day-Lewis on his future Academy Award nomination for whatever year this movie comes out.\nTags: paul thomas anderson daniel day-lewis movies the industry Share   44 seconds  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:20:13.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
