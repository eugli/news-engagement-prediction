Article continues below \nOn first blush, it looked like Styles hit the ground first, but Daniel Bryan ran out and called the match a draw before any real dispute could take hold. \nThe ending left the entire show feeling disjointed and during Talking Smack, the GM would have to face one of the men that he cost a direct chance at the contender position. Article continues below Wayne Shaw reveals the real reason he ate a pie during the Arsenal game \nStyles then said that Bryan made terrible decisions and that is when the show went sideways as the SmackDown head man took some shots at the superstar’s personal beliefs. \nHe claimed that The Phenomenal One believes that the Earth is flat and the challenger barely refuted that claim. \nKyrie Irving of the NBA Champion Cleveland Cavaliers made some similar comments over the weekend, but was revealed to be joking and fans have similar skepticism about Styles’ beliefs after his comments on the show. \nBryan’s claim did a good job of getting the heat off of himself for that terrible decision to end the show, but no one will be talking about how round Earth is if fans don’t get resolution to this dilemma soon. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
