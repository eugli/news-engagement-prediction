IndiaToday.in | Written by Samrudhi Ghosh A + A - Ileana D'Cruz and her boyfriend Andrew Kneebone \nIleana D'Cruz is one of the few actors who does not shy away from flaunting her relationship. Unlike many of her contemporaries who hide behind the 'good friends' tag, Ileana frequently posts pictures with her Australian boyfriend, Andrew Kneebone, on her Instagram account. \nGiven their PDA on social media, the Main Tera Hero actor was asked by Bombay Times if marriage was on the cards. Ileana replied, \"I find it funny when you ask me that question. What's the big deal about marriage? I am happy, I am in a great space, I am doing great films and I am where I am. I think marriage is overrated. Dude, calm down! When I want to announce the fact that I am getting married, I will do it. A little mystery is also important. If I always let the cat out of the bag, why would people be interested in me anymore?\" \nInterestingly, a report in The Times Of India suggested that Ileana had already tied the knot with Andrew in a secret ceremony and was keeping the news of her nuptials under wraps. \nOn the work front, Ileana will be seen next in Milan Luthria's Baadshaho and Anees Bazmee's Mubarakan. \nALSO WATCH: Ileana D'Cruz talks about her fitness regime To get the latest entertainment news and gossip, follow us on Twitter @Showbiz_IT and Like us on facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
