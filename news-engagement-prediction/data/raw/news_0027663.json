The new clothing ranges will be rolled out in Birmingham, Leicester, and Shepherd’s Bush and a slew of international stores, reports the Daily Mail , along with a selection of dresses, jumpsuits, kimono-style wraps, and other garments marketed for their supposed “modesty”.\nThe hijab is a less conservative form of head-covering relative to the niqab, a face veil which leaves only a narrow slit for the eyes, or the burqa, which conceals even the eyes beneath a mesh of fabric.\nThe burkah and the niqab have both been banned in a number of European countries, and Norway’s former ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Carl Schiøtz Wibye, has recently recommended a similar ban in his own country.\n“The niqab is not part of Islam,” the diplomat claimed. “It is an interpretation that emerged in recent years … to keep women in their place.”\nPolling indicates that a majority in the United Kingdom would also favour a ban on the religious garments. Fifty-seven per cent of respondents to a YouGov survey supported banning the veil in public places, compared with 25 who were opposed – a margin of roughly two-to-one.\nIn countries where the less divisive hijab becomes common or even mandatory, such as Iran, significant pressure to adopt more conservative forms of head covering often develops. Women wearing more form-fitting or revealing garments are sexually harassed, while women thought to be wearing “bad hijab” – pushing their headscarves too far back, for example – have been targeted by Islamic vigilantes in acid attacks .\nAyaan Hirsi Ali , the former Muslim and human rights campaigner who now lives under a fatwa, has criticised the characterisation of the hijab as “modest” in the past.\nWorse, the hijab as a symbol justifies the rape of women who refuse to wear it. It is time to discard it like the chastity belt.\n— Ayaan Hirsi Ali (@Ayaan) December 22, 2015\n“[T]he hijab is anything but modest”, she wrote in December 2015. “All it does is reduce a woman to her genitalia!\n“Worse, the hijab as a symbol justifies the rape of women who refuse to wear it.
