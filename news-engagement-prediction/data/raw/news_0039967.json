Source: AP \nZenz was arrested by authorities after he was spotted having his photo taken outside the home Hitler first lived in. \nIt is illegal to glorify Hitler or the Nazi regime in Austria, as it is in Germany. \nIn France, waving a flag with a Nazi swastika on it can get you arrested. \n“It is definitely not a carnival joke or an art project,” a police spokesman told the BBC . “The young man knows exactly what he is doing,” \nHitler was born in Braunau am Inn, then part of Austria-Hungary, in 1889. \nAustria’s Parliament voted in December to buy the three-storey house where the dictator was born, which the Government has rented since 1972 to control how it is used. \nGlorifying Hitler or the Nazis is a crime in Austria, which Nazi Germany annexed in 1938.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:06:56.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
