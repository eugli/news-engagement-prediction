ATO's online meltdown to be reviewed by independent expert Read more \nThe ABC has reported that management attempted to extend the finish time to 5pm, before a significant backlash forced them to scrap the proposal. Briefings to staff reportedly said the proposal was the most disliked of any changes flagged in the new enterprise agreement. \n“Of all the changes proposed in the enterprise agreement (EA) package, this was the one you told us you disliked the most,” the briefing reportedly said. “It was clear from your feedback that this had to go and I think it goes a long way to demonstrating that we’re genuine about getting an EA in place for the next three years.” \nTax office staff have been without a pay rise since 2013 and have now rejected three offers. \nThe Community and Public Sector Union says it is fighting to prevent a further erosion of conditions and entitlements at the ATO, saying the agency has already been weakened to such an extent that it can no longer tackle multinational tax avoidance. \nThe last vote, made in December, resoundingly rejected the proposal of ATO management, with 71% of staff voting “no” . Roughly the same number voted down the previous offer in May and 85% rejected the first offer in December 2015. \nThe CPSU national secretary, Nadine Flood, said after the last agreement that cuts to tax were “making it easier for multinational companies and wealthy individuals to dodge paying their fair share”. \nEarlier this month, the smaller Australian Services Union alleged ATO management was not complying with good faith bargaining requirements and sought advice from lawyers. \nThe union said that made any further attempt at conciliation “futile” and sought to have the negotiations back before the Fair Work Commission for hearing. The Australian Tax Office transparency reporting is looking a little opaque Read more \nThe scale of cuts at the ATO has been significant in the past three years. The CPSU says more than 4400 jobs have been cut from the agency. \nAnnual reports suggest 906 jobs were cut in 2013-14, 2200 in 2014-15 and 590 in 2015-16. \nThe ATO has experienced significant controversy over the summer. \nCritical online services suffered significant outages following the failure of new Hewlett Packard Enterprise storage systems . \nThe outages left the ATO website down and took vital tools like the tax agent portal offline.
