Compare with our MoneySupermarket-powered search Len McCluskey, Unite's general secretary, said: 'The French government owns a significant chunk and they've already come out to say they welcome the prospect of Peugeot buying Vauxhall.\nWe want to make sure our Government is not sitting on the sidelines because you can bet your life the French will be defending French jobs.\nUp for sale after 92 years The Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire is the current home of the Vauxhall Astra\nVauxhall was set up 1857 and built pumps and marine engines It made its first car in 1903 and moved to Luton in 1905 General Motors bought the business for £2million in 1925 Car production at the Luton plant was suspended during WW2 to build the Churchill tank It was bombed in August 1940, killing 39 workers and didn't start making passenger vehicles again until 1945 Its manufacturing plant in Ellesmere Port opened in 1962 Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port facility now makes the popular Vauxhall Astra model 'I'll be seeking urgent conversations with the Government because everything must be done to secure our world-class automotive industry.'\nA PSA spokesman said it was too early to speculate on the nature of the deal. But a merger would probably lead to job cuts across Europe.\nPSA, which has worked with GM in Europe since 2012, said it was exploring 'strategic initiatives', but said there was no guarantee an agreement would be reached.\nA Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesman said: 'Speculation is a matter for the companies involved.\nGM's sale would include both Vauxhall and the Opel brand that's used across other European markets\nThe Government remains in close contact with GM as we closely monitor the situation.' Vauxhall was founded in 1857.\nIts manufacturing plant in Ellesmere Port, in the North West, was opened in 1962 and started making cars two years later.\nIt now produces 47 cars an hour and the Vauxhall Astra and the Vauxhall Corsa are among the best-selling cars in the UK.\nThe talks are the second time PSA and GM have attempted a partnership. The two had an agreement in Europe, which involved GM taking a 7 per cent stake in PSA, but it was unwound in 2013.\nThey have also had their fair share of financial difficulties.\nLast week GM reported a £206million loss from its European operations last year, for the 16th consecutive year, which brought its losses on the continent since 2000 to more than £12billion.\nThe firm also said it had to raise UK car prices by 2.5 per cent after the EU referendum result.\nPSA nearly collapsed three years ago, resulting in a £2.5billion state-backed bailout. The French government now owns 14 per cent of it.\nDeals Of The Week Top rate: 5% on up to £2.500 FlexDirect 1.1% easy access rate Top savings deal Spend £10, get £15 bonus in ANY store New members only Best buy low rate card 5.85% APR £7+ in monthly rewards Blue Rewards", "external_links": ["http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/car-insurance-finder", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/details/?productCode=CUR_nationwide_FlexDirect_Tier01_1_2500&index=5&count=11&selectedProductId=CUR_nationwide_FlexDirect_Tier01_1_2500&gid=CUR_OVERDRAFT&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.quidco.com/ref?cid=4831&utm_source=ThisisMoney&utm_campaign=ThisisMoney_AffiliateArticle&utm_medium=AffiliateArticle", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/current-accounts/details/?productCode=CUR_barclaybnk_BankAcc_BlueRewards_tier_01_0_0&index=2&count=11&selectedProductId=CUR_barclaybnk_BankAcc_BlueRewards_tier_01_0_0&gid=CUR_OVERDRAFT&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/credit-cards/details/?productCode=CC_AA_TRANSFER_PLUS_CARD&index=3&count=106&selectedProductId=CC_AA_TRANSFER_PLUS_CARD&gid=CC_ALLCARDS&page=&source=THISMO1", "http://www.moneysupermarket.com/shop/third-party-promotion-click/?product_sku=SAV_RCIBANK_48F18975BBD543A59694F181F61CBE1C&source=TM1&channel_id=116"], "published": "2017-02-15T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:33:25.683+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
