Inner West Sam Fricker’s head-first approach to diving scores him a Junior Sports Star award City February 23, 2017 12:34pm\nDIVER Sam Fricker, who won last night’s Inner West Junior Sports Star award, has a girl to thank for getting him to practice sessions when he was younger.\n“At first I didn’t want to go but knew she would be there,” the fourteen-year-old said. “Then I started to like the diving.”\nThe girl, who will remain nameless, is now a pleasant memory but Fricker has launched himself head-first into his sport.\nHe has hopes for a berth in the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast in 2018 and representing Australia in 2020 at the Olympic Games in Tokyo.\nAt last night’s award ceremony at Sydney Olympic Park’s WatervieW, Fricker was awarded $1000 for winning the Inner West Courier Junior Sports Star award.\nmedia_camera Sam Fricker accepts his award and has a chat with Foxtel MC Adam Peacock.\nBut it has not been an easy ride.\nIn 2014, when he started to show some serious talent, his mother would drive him from his home in Newcastle to get to practice sessions at the Homebush pool as no local winter diving classes were offered.\nNow the family has moved to Strathfield and he trains close to 24 hours a week with the NSW Institute of Sport.\nLast May, Sam won the 1m, 3m, platform and synchronised diving events at the Elite State championships and, previously, at the national age diving titles.\nThe inner west lad was named the outstanding male diver of the year by Diving Australia at the National Age Diving Championships in 2015.\nHe received a Combined Independent Schools outstanding Sports Achievement Award in 2015 and previously, when he was living in Newcastle, he received two prestigious Hunter Blues Awards.\nmedia_camera Sam Fricker is at home diving from the high boards. Picture: Carly Earl\nThere’s no doubt the Trinity Grammar School student has a fearless love for the sport.\nDespite injuring his wrist last year - a common injury for divers — he still loves to dive from the highest, 10m platform.\n“There’s something about it. You go from 60kms to 0 as you hit the water,” he said.\nNot only can entry into the water be painful but the G-forces while airbone can also put pressure on the body.\nAs a result, strength training is an essential part of the practice regimen.\nHe is part of the Diving NSW Elite and Development squads.\nBefore taking up diving, Sam medalled at state and NSW Country level in gymnastics and has represented at state level for athletics in high jump and long jump.\nLast night, nineteen sports star finalists took out the top gongs for their regions and were each rewarded with $1000 to help them with their sporting careers.\nYOUNG SPORTING SPIRIT WINNER JUNIOR cricketer Oliver Rackley was struck on the knee cap during Leichhardt Wanderers’ grand final decider last year and carried from the pitch. It was thought he may need to go to hospital, but Oliver stuck around to watch his mates. In the final minutes, his side still trailing by six runs and be limped back out to bat and the team won by one run in the best tradition of overcoming adversity.\nRackley was given the $500 Young Sporting Spirit finalist award for his bravery and perseverance which he was thrilled to win. He remembers the day clearly.\n“I wanted to go back in but found it hard to walk,” he said. Despite the pain, he limped back out on the pitch and partnered for the winning score.\nmedia_camera Oliver Rackley won the Inner West Courier Young Sporting Spirit Award at the NewsLocal Junior Sports Star Award Presentation evening at Waterview in Bicentennial Park, Homebush OVERALL WINNER\nFOOTBALLER Ellie Carpenter scored the overall Junior Sports Star medal for outstanding performance in 2016.\nThe awards, sponsored by Rebel, are open to rising sporting stars aged from 10 to 16 and were presented at a gala dinner held at Bicentennial Park’s Waterview conference centre on Wednesday night.\nmedia_camera Matilda player Ellie Carpenter took out the overall award.
