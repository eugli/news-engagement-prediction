On Saturday, Trudeau took to Twitter to declare: “To those fleeing persecution, terror & war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith. Diversity is our strength. #Welcome to Canada.” The world loved it. It has now turned out to have been a platitude, a Liberal advertising jingle, and a hashtag. \nDuring Tuesday night’s emergency House of Commons debate on the implications of Trump’s malicious and shambolic executive order, the Peace Tower was illuminated in green to honour the six Muslims murdered while at prayer Sunday night at the Islamic Centre of Quebec in Quebec City. The visitor’s gallery was packed. The doors were opened to allow the Speaker’s Gallery to fill up. \nCabinet ministers and Liberal MPs said more nice things about Canada and about each other and they dutifully recited the Diversity is Our Strength jingle at every opportunity, but the one important thing they made abundantly plain during the Opposition questions that began at 7:30 and ended close to midnight was this: in the face of the United States’ four-month executive abdication from its commitments under the 1951 Refugee Convention, during the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, Canada will not step up. \nCanada will do nothing about it, and Justin Trudeau’s government doesn’t want Canadian citizens to do anything either. You can march around in your pussy hat and chant slogans until you’re hoarse. You can flood Facebook with the most dubious claims about the superiority of Canada’s splendid multicultural diversity, you can bewail Islamophobia and you can exaggerate the hell out of the difference between the Liberal and Conservative immigration records. \nBut if you and a group of your friends want to raise some money and bring to Canada just one of those broken-hearted Syrian families whose ticket in the American resettlement lottery was ripped up last Friday, you’re not allowed to anymore. Been there. Done that. \nThe Liberal election victory in November, 2015 was due in no small measure to the promises Trudeau made in response to a massive upwelling in Canadian anger and empathy for the people who had fled Syrian butcher Bashar al-Assad’s human abbatoir. A close look at Canada’s impressive and praiseworthy Syrian refugee resettlement numbers – 40,000 since Trudeau formed his government – shows that only slightly more than half were “government-assisted” resettlements. \nAnyway, that was then, but this is now, and the suave and capable Ahmed Hussen, the Liberals’ newly appointed Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship minister, had nothing new to say during Tuesday night’s debate. \nSyrian refugees make up the largest refugee population on Earth. There are at least five million of them now, and still they were singled out for the cruelest treatment in Trump’s decree. For the next 90 days, no visitor of any kind will be permitted to enter the United States from Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, or Libya and for the next 120 days, no refugee from anywhere in the world will be permitted to resettle in the United States. Syrian refugees are barred “indefinitely.” \nWhen it’s back up and running, the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program will be cut in half. From about 70,000 refugees resettled in the U.S. in 2015, the 2017 numbers will be reduced to about 35,000. \nNew Democratic Party leader Thomas Mulcair led the Tuesday night debate with a series of perfectly sensible proposals. Suspend the Safe Third Country Agreement Canada concluded with the U.S. back in 2002. Lift the 1,000-application cap on refugee sponsorships by small groups of private citizens. Fast-track applications American authorities had approved for resettlement before the Trump’s system shutdown, and work with other countries to take up the slack created by the four-month American truancy from the 1951 Refugee Convention. \nReasonable objections might have been raised against suspending the Third Country agreement, which is aimed at dissuading applications for asylum in Canada filed from the United States. There is a provision in the agreement that allows Canada to consider claims if they’re deemed in the public interest, for instance, so you could keep the arrangement in place and deal with any serious cases. But this wasn’t even offered as a proper excuse Tuesday night. The answer was “no.” \nThe rest of the NDP package packed the added heft of support from Conservative immigration critic Michelle Rempel, whose speech Tuesday night was tinged with sadness and resignation. Rempel wrested a 313-0 House of Commons vote last October giving the Trudeau government 120 days to open Canada’s doors to the viciously persecuted Yazidis of Iraqi Kurdistan. The Yazidis have been subjected to what the UN has deemed a genocide at the hands of the Islamic State. With only days left in that timeline, Hussen’s officials have yet to resettle a single Yazidi in Canada. \nEven without bringing other countries into it, Canadians on their own could privately sponsor these refugees in a matter of weeks \nAs for the rest of the Mulcair’s proposals, Ahmed Hussen and his officials could implement them in their sleep. The Syrian refugees the Trump decree has left immediately and indefinitely stranded in bleak UN facilities and in makeshift encampments and back alleys in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon can be numbered at about 2,248 innocents. That’s how many were slated for resettlement in the U.S. over the next two months. Even without bringing other countries into it, Canadians on their own could privately sponsor these refugees in a matter of weeks. \nThousands of Canadians have teamed up in small groups to privately sponsor Syrian refugee families, only to be turned away by their own government. Thousands more Canadians have turned to churches and community groups — “sponsorship agreement holders” — only to be told that Canada’s refugee-resettlement resources have been bled so dry since last year that they could be waiting years to bring a family to Canada. \nCanadians from all walks of life have done their country proud over the past few months. To those fleeing persecution, terror and war, regardless of their faith, Canadians really have opened their arms. The shame of it is that now that we are faced with a refugee crisis of Donald Trump’s making, and our government is all hat, no cattle. \nIt’s really not much to ask. If the Trudeau government isn’t going to help all those abandoned and betrayed refugees, the least it could do is let Canadians put their backs into it and get the hell out of the way. \nNational Post ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T00:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T13:49:29.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
