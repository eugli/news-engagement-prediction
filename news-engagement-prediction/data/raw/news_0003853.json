This time, Sloth and Michael Knight are joining the team! \nYou’ve been waiting patiently for years for Chris Columbus and Steven Spielberg to come up with a story for Goonies 2 . Thankfully, you won’t have to wait long to suit up as Sloth in Dimensions. The Level Pack is due to arrive on February 10 (along with the rest of the new wave), and it features a Sloth minifig, the super-creepy organ (it’s nothing like your mother’s Steinway), and the pirate ship. \nHere are a couple of screencaps from the Goonies level: \nHey, you guys! There’s another 80s icon arriving soon, too! German pop music phenomenon, hirsute lifeguard, and all around man’s man David Hasselhoff is finally getting the minifig treatment. \nYes, Michael Knight and the Knight Industries Two Thousand are ready to takes on the seedier side of the Lego Dimensions universe. This one’s a Fun Pack, so there’s no dedicated level. Still… Lego Knight Rider! \nThis is what I call a dynamic duo: \nIf you want to get your hands on the Knight Rider Fun Pack as soon it’s released, you’ll have to head to the nearest GameStop. They’ve got a timed exclusive on it. \nThere’s also a new Lego Batman Movie Story Pack arriving just in time for the film’s big debut. It comes with BatGirl, a sweet, bespectacled Robin, the Bat Computer, and Bat Wing… and it lets you play through the entire movie, just like the new Ghostbusters pack did.
