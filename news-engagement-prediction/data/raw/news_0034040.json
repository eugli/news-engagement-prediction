US warns N Korea against nuclear attack The report also said that Kim Jong-un \"expressed great satisfaction\" over the test launch, which it said \"adds to the tremendous might of the country\".\nSouth Korea and US officials said the missile flew east towards the Sea of Japan for about 500km (300 miles).\nThe missile reached an altitude of about 550km (350 miles), the South Korean military said.\nExperts suggest the tests are programmed for shorter distances to avoid a missile landing on Japan.\nThis was the latest in a series of tests in the past year, including North Korea's fifth of a nuclear device.\nThe launch took place at 07:55 local time (22:55 GMT Saturday) from the Panghyon air base in North Pyongan province on the west side of the Korean peninsula.\nUnited Nations resolutions forbid North Korea from carrying out ballistic missile tests - part of wider efforts to prevent it becoming a fully nuclear-armed power.\nSouth Korea's foreign ministry said that \"North Korea's repeated provocations show the Kim Jong-un regime's nature of irrationality, maniacally obsessed in its nuclear and missile development\".\n'Hostility' Nato also condemned the missile test, with Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg urging North Korea \"not to raise tensions further and to re-engage in a credible and meaningful dialogue with the international community\".\nThe European Union joined the criticism, declaring in a statement that North Korea's \"repeated disregard of its international obligations is provocative and unacceptable\".\nDonald Trump said that the US \"stands behind Japan 100%\" Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, standing next to Mr Trump on a visit to the United States, said the test was \"absolutely intolerable\".\nAs for the US, Mr Trump said on Saturday: \"America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100%.\"\nChina, North Korea's closest ally, has yet to comment. Beijing has joined in international efforts to press Kim Jong-un to rein in his nuclear ambitions.\nKim Jong-un has authorised several missile and nuclear tests in the past year In January, Kim Jong-un warned that his military was close to testing long-range missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the United States mainland, but experts doubt the technology has progressed that far.\nAt the time, Mr Trump derided the claim in a tweet, saying: \"It won't happen.\"\nOn a visit to South Korea last week, US Defence Secretary James Mattis said that any use of nuclear weapons by North Korea would be met with an \"effective and overwhelming\" response.\nHe also reconfirmed plans to deploy a US missile defence system in South Korea later this year.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-17399847", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/D211/production/_94277735_mediaitem94277734.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/FB29/production/_94279246_northkoreasouthkoreajapan4640217.png", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11813699", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A36D/production/_94273814_trump.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3243/production/_94276821_hi037838440.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:06:15.420+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
