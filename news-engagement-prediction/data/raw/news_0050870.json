France is destroying them with eagles Last updated 05:32, February 22 2017 JILL WORRALL \nWith unmatched speed and sight and bone-crushing talons, birds of prey have been trained to hunt for hundreds of years - for other animals, of course. \nUnder French military supervision, four golden eagle chicks hatched last year atop drones - born into a world of terror and machines they would be bred to destroy. \nThe eagles - named d'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis - grew up with their nemeses. \nThey chased drones through green grass that summer, pecking futilely at composite shells as seen in Sky News footage. \nThey were rewarded with meat, which they ate off the backs of the drones. \nREAD MORE: Dutch police employing eagles to take down drones \nWhen the eagles were ready - this month - d'Artagnan launched screeching from a military control tower across a field, Agence France-Presse reported. \nThe bird covered 200 metres in 20 seconds, slamming into a drone, then diving with the wreckage into the tall grass. \n\"The eagles are making good progress,\" said the French air force's commander of a programme that adapts the ancient art of falconry to the threats of unmanned flight. \nWeeks earlier, on the other side of the world, Iraqi soldiers fired their guns wildly into the sky after a small drone dropped a bomb on them. \nTerrorists have been modifying devices that can be bought in toy stores into weapons and radio-controlled spies, the Associated Press reported. Ad Feedback \nThe French have been concerned since early 2015, when drones flew over the presidential palace and a restricted military site, according to Agence France-Presse . \nNo one was harmed. But terrorist attacks later that year, including the November massacre in Paris, inspired military officials to creative prevention. \nThey wanted a way to take down drones without shooting at them - a potential disaster if one went rogue in a crowded area. \nA solution presented itself in an experiment by Dutch police, who last year used a trained eagle to pluck a DJI Phantom drone out of the air. \nWith unmatched speed and sight and bone-crushing talons, birds of prey have been trained to hunt for hundreds of years - for other animals, of course. But a wild eagle demonstrated natural hostility to a drone in Australia - as the doomed machine's final footage revealed on CNN . \nThus, in France, four eggs \"were placed before birth on top of drones while still inside the eggshell and, after hatching, kept them there during their early feeding period,\" Reuters reported in November. \nThe eagles were named after characters in The Three Musketeers , and by February proved capable of intercepting drones in lightning-fast horizontal chases. \n\"Soon they will be casting off from peaks in the nearby Pyrenees Mountains,\" Agence France-Presse reported. \nThe military has already ordered a second brood of eagles, according to the outlet. \nMeanwhile, d'Artagnan and his siblings will be outfitted with high technology to carry on their war against machines. \n\"The military is designing mittens of leather and Kevlar, an anti-blast material, to protect their talons,\" Agence France-Presse reported. - The Washington Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:38:30.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
