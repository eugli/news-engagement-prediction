But the high upfront cost (as much as $500-1,000 for someone who’s uninsured) has dissuaded many women from choosing them. Usage of IUDs increased after the Affordable Care Act went into wide effect in 2014.\nPassed in 2010, the ACA mandated healthcare plans to provide some preventive services, including birth control, at no extra cost. And a study last year in the journal Contraception found that the ACA’s requirements had a notable impact on lowering the out-of-pocket expenses for women for birth control.\nA separate study of 30,000 privately insured women in the Midwest found that the ACA mandate resulted in cheaper birth control and produced a significant increase in the use of contraceptives, including a large increase in women choosing long-acting birth control methods such as IUDs and implants.\nThe rise in access and decrease in cost in birth control in the U.S. has also coincided with a relatively sharp decline in the nation’s teen birth rate, which was the lowest on record in 2015 .\nIt remains unclear how Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress will approach changes to the Affordable Care Act. An early push for fast repeal has stalled as Republicans consider the possible political consequences of any action.\nStill, reproductive health advocates say they’re worried about Trump’s pick to head the Health and Human Services Department, Republican Congressman Tom Price. In 2013, he voted in favor of the amendment to a budget resolution that would have allow insurers to opt out of covering birth control based on religious or moral objections.\nBut with the Affordable Care Act still the law of the land for now, it seems women are taking advantage of it to prevent pregnancy.", "external_links": ["http://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(14)00687-8/abstract", "http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/11/health-secretary-pick-tom-price-on-abortion-birth-control.html", "https://insight.athenahealth.com/trump-effect-iud-visits-rise-after-election", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/us/politics/obamacare-tom-price-trump.html", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Famerican-women-are-rushing-to-get-birth-control-that-could-outlast-a-trump-presidency", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=American", "http://time.com/3719120/iuds-are-getting-more-popular-with-american-women/", "https://www.guttmacher.org/news-release/2015/new-study-shows-steep-decline-out-pocket-costs-hormonal-iuds"], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:21:11.090+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
