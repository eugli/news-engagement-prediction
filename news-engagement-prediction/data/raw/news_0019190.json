I think they'd woken up to the fact that what they were doing was essentially illegal and they thought they better try and get out of it. But as I said, you know, … we'd already accepted the deal. 'Witness may have been improperly influenced' \nThe Senate voted today to refer the allegations to the Standing Committee of Privileges, which investigates conduct that may obstruct the work of the Senate. \nOn Wednesday night, the Senate president, Tasmanian Senator Stephen Parry, told Parliament the Environment and Communications Committee had reported that the allegations may have substance. \n\"Having taken the necessary steps, the committee has concluded that the witness may have been improperly influenced,\" he said. \n\"The only remaining remedy to address those concerns is the use of the Senate's contempt powers.\" \nThe matter will now be investigated further, which will likely involve submissions from both parties and closed hearings. Privileges Committee 'almost like a court of law' \nFormer Senate president Paul Calvert, who was a Tasmanian senator for two decades, said referrals to the Privileges Committee were not common. \n\"It's something that's not used a lot, but is regarded very highly by all members of the Senate,\" he said. \n\"It's made up of members of all parties and is seen as an independent body. \n\"It's almost like a court of law — the Priveleges Committee will consider what action may need to be taken if there is found to be a breach of privilege. \n\"They do have penalties, and if it's a serious breach, then other action can be taken.\" \nA spokesman for Tassal said the company was not yet in a position to comment. \n\"It is difficult for Tassal to comment too specifically as the company is yet to receive any formal instructions from the committee,\" he said. \nMr Hastwell declined to comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T10:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:11:55.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
