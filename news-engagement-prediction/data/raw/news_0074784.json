Gary also took a selfie with what appeared to be Mahershala Ali's Oscar but not Ali himself. \n\"I feel like youâ€™re ignoring all the white celebrities,\" Kimmel said to Gary toward the end of the bit. \n\"Yes, I am,\" replied Gary. \nSuffice it to say, Gary gave hands down the best performance of the night.
