Wells Tags: Big Food , Big Pharma , Chemotherapy , Food Myths , GMO , holistic , medicine myths , Myths , organic canola , organic soy , toxic food , toxic medicine \n( Natural News ) Everybody wants to be healthy, well-informed and financially free, but most of us receive the wrong advice, believe in popular myths, get sick from ridiculous illnesses that are totally preventable and curable, and then spend our money trying to get ourselves “fixed” by doctors who don’t understand a lick about nutrition. All this while we keep eating the same bad food and taking the same symptom cover-up, chemical-based medicines. \nWhy do we heed all this bad advice and consume chemicals to treat chemical disorders? We do this because corporations are very sneaky, and they push the same lies over and over, across different mediums and even through the mouths of shill doctors, dentists, scientists, academics, journalists and the like. \nYou hear the Big Food and Big Pharma tales repeatedly, and then you start to believe them. You read them everywhere; you hear them on television. You read them in Prevention Magazine or via WebMD . You look them up in Wikipedia and your MD regurgitates them for bonus cash. \nLet’s put an end to all this self-inflicted misery. So, here they come and here they’ll go – away for good, now that you know better. Don’t fall for the top 10 food and medicine myths! #1. Milk … it does a body good \nWrong! Think about this for a minute: Humans are the only animals that drink milk after infancy and from another animal; it’s just not normal. Plus, all dairy products cause excess mucus to accumulate in the body and lead to inflammation. #2. Red meat is worse for your body than chicken, turkey or pig \nMost meat in America comes from confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) where the animals are cooped up in overcrowded pens, rarely if ever see sunlight or pastures, are shot up with synthetic hormones (that cause cancer), injected with massive amounts of antibiotics to stave off bacterial infections, fed genetically modified feed (that also causes cancer) and slaughtered inhumanely – then processed with bleach, ammonia, nitrates and nitrites for human consumption. So, with that in mind, it doesn’t really matter if the meat is red, brown, white or green, because it’s all doing the same chronic damage to the humans that consume it regularly. “Eat less red meat?” Try eating no processed meat and you’ll be far better off. #3. Organic canola oil is a healthy choice \nEverything organic is not healthy. Let’s go there. Organic means it doesn’t contain chemical-based insecticides, algaecides, fertilizers and herbicides. What it doesn’t mean is that it’s free of heavy metals or trace amounts of dangerous chemicals. Canola is not a natural plant to this earth. Canola comes from rapeseed , which is toxic to all animals. What the manufacturers do is remove the stench of rapeseed using hexane, a constituent vapor of gasoline, but there’s still some left in the final product. Irrespective of whether canola is organic or not, it strangles your mitochondria (cells) that need oxygen to function. Organic canola also inhibits enzyme function. Plus, the omega-3 fatty acids of processed canola oil are transformed during the deodorizing process into trans-fatty acids. The reason why canola is particularly unsuited for consumption is that it contains a very long-chain fatty acid called erucic acid, which is associated with fibrotic heart lesions. #4. Organic soy (that’s unfermented) is a healthy choice \nSome people think if a product is organic, it’s “good to go.” Wrong. You still need to stay informed. Let’s talk about any soy that’s not fermented, including the organic stuff. Big Food is quickly buying up medium-sized organic companies and pushing soy and canola like it’s healthy. Just over the past 15 years, 3,000 new soy-based foods, all labeled “certified organic” have hit the shelves. Why? Big Food likes to trick healthy-minded people, that’s why. Remember, Big Food works hand-in-hand with Big Pharma. \nAll soy that’s not fermented screws with the balance of human estrogen and testosterone. Got breast cancer or “Low-T?” Did you know unfermented soy is linked to immune-system malfunctions, thyroid dysfunction and cognitive decline? Yep. In fact, hundreds of health studies reveal infant abnormalities, kidney stones and food allergies thanks to soy consumption. No soy was fit to eat until the discovery of fermentation techniques during the Chou Dynasty. Your organic soy “protein” may be causing you chronic deficiencies in amino acid uptake. Destroy the soy myth and protect your body. #5. Vaccines no longer contain mercury (thimerosal), and the CDC even says so \nThe CDC says they removed mercury from all childhood vaccines over a decade ago, but they’re lying. Influenza vaccines contain massive amounts of mercury and are highly recommended by the CDC for pregnant women, infants 6 months old, and every person for every year of their lives thereafter. Yes, influenza vaccines (flu shots) are one of the main causes of the flu and still contain thimerosal, formaldehyde, aluminum and other dangerous preservatives, adjuvants, emulsifiers and virus “deadeners.” #6. Chemotherapy is the best chance to beat cancer once you’ve been diagnosed \nFact: Chemotherapy yields a miserable 2.3 percent success rate on average. Another fact: 75 percent of MDs and oncologists would never take chemotherapy themselves nor recommend it for their family members. Chemotherapy destroys the human immune system – the one thing humans need the most to fight off cancer. Quite ironic, huh? Natural remedies for cancer are abundant and inexpensive, including vitamin C, garlic, oregano oil, CBD oil , hemp seed oil, chaga and reishi mushrooms, baking soda in water, and of course, plenty of vitamin D. #7. Many cancer cases are inherited in our genes from our parents or their parents \nDoctors tell patients almost everything is inherited from their parents so they won’t go out and seek natural remedies that work . Why would any greedy doctor want you cured when you’ll never come back to them? Most cancer is caused by chemical consumption, period. #8. There is no cure for cancer \nThe search for the cure is the ultimate boondoggle. Honest scientists have been curing cancer for decades – even brain cancer. Google the Burzynski Clinic and you’ll be blown away! Then research natural remedies online. #9. The FDA and the CDC function in the best interests of American consumers by inspecting food and medicine for dangerous substances \nLaughing out loud. The FDA and the CDC are in business with Big Pharma and have been for decades. Want to die of preventable diseases? Just heed their advice. #10. Fluoride in toothpaste and tap water helps humans keep their teeth strong and free of decay \nIf you aren’t already aware of it, it’s time to learn the raw truth about tap water and toothpaste.
