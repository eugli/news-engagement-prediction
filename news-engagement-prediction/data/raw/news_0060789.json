It could be seen as a divisive statement from an artist once known to walk on stage with just his acoustic guitar—holding it up to the audience and announcing, “ Hi, we’re the Mountain Goats .” Of course, over the last decade, Darnielle has become known as more than just a guy with a guitar. He’s also an acclaimed novelist, Twitter humorist, and leader of a four-piece band. \n“Andrew Eldritch Is Moving Back to Leeds” is the first taste from Goths , and it’s far from the dark, throbbing work the album’s title or Sisters of Mercy-referencing lyrics suggests. Sounding more like Leonard Cohen doing country , “Andrew Eldritch” is a simple, smooth, and somewhat modernized Mountain Goats anthem, which just happens to be about SOM’s erstwhile leader. Singing calmly atop glimmery keys and woodwinds, Darnielle sounds right at home, describing a half-glorious homecoming that may or may not have actually taken place. “Nobody ever gets away/Even the best of us come back some day” he sings. It’s a powerful lesson from a songwriter whose music has wandered and expanded, but never lost its identity. If you listen closely, you can even hallucinate his wild strumming somewhere in the background.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:22:49.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
