HOW hard Foxes players tried to get Claudio Ranieri sacked, the Italian’s next career move, and how his axing could impact Aaron Mooy. \nHere’s the latest rumours around the firing of the Leicester boss. \nFOXES TRIED TO GET RANIERI SACKED FOUR TIMES \nClaudio Ranieri is no longer Leicester manager, and according to The Sun , it’s something Foxes players have wanted for a while. \nThe report details that players including Wes Morgan, Kasper Schmeichel and Jamie Vardy met with director of football Jon Rudkin four times to attempt to get the manager sacked, with the first meeting being held last December. \nHowever, it was only in a hotel at East Midlands Airport after returning from Seville following the Champions League defeat that he was sacked, according to The Mail . Vardy finally scores in 2017 0:48 \nThe Sun also reported via West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady that Leicester chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha told the director of another Premier League club that he had sacked Ranieri, before the chairmain then bought £500,000 worth of wine. \nBrady said: “Whilst browsing the Leicester owner told him that in an hour or so news would break they had sacked Claudio Ranieri. \n“He then went and settled his bill for wine and champagne, quite casually. \n“I am guessing the compensation payment to his old manager is mere pocket change by comparison. \n“Such a shame that the fairytale turned into a nightmare. \n“At least the owner can drown his sorrows in some style.” Leicester City's chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Ranieri. Source: AP \nRANIERI’S NEXT MOVE? \nDespite that fact his “dream has died” with Leicester, Ranieri reportedly wants to stay in football management. \nThe Sun is reporting he could soon be back at Fiorentina if current manager Paulo Sousa completes a move to Juventus. \nHowever, a potential Sousa move would also depend on Max Allegri ending his three-year spell in Turin, who has been linked with taking over the Arsenal job from Arsene Wenger. \nRanieri began managing the Italian club in 1993 and led them to promotion to Serie A before claiming his first major trophies - the Coppa Italia and Italian Super Cup - in 1996. \nBut the Italian also reportedly has multiple offers to manage clubs in the Chinese Super League.

He will be in the history of LCFC, in the hearts of Leicester fans and all football lovers.” \nThe bookmakers next favourite is Alan Pardew , who was previously sacked by Newcastle and Crystal Palace.

He helped Fulham to survival in 2008 when they looked dead and buried although, at 69, is four years older than Ranieri and the club may look for a more youthful approach going forward. Saving Leicester would help restore his reputation, which was tarnished by England’s wretched form at the 2014 World Cup and their embarrassing Euro 2016 exit against minnows Iceland.

The Dutchman was sacked in November after just 85 days in charge at Inter Milan. He won four league titles in his six years at Ajax and was also Holland’s assistant manager. He has been linked recently with Glasgow giants Rangers. \nNigel Pearson \nThe 53-year-old has already had two spells at Leicester and is reported to be favoured by some Foxes players for another return to the club. He was dismissed in June 2015 having guided Leicester to a relegation escape by winning seven of their last nine games to beat the drop having looked certain to go down. However, Pearson’s relationship with the owners broke down after a string of bizarre off-field antics and the sacking of his son James following the emergence of an explicit video in Bangkok during a 2015 tour. A 2014 Championship title win added to the 2009 League One crown he won with the club in his first spell between 2008 and 2010 before leaving for Hull.
