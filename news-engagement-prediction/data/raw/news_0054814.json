A proposed German Octoberfest-themed restaurant is now planned at the corner of Scott and… more Provided Kevin Townsell is packing up his lederhosen and shifting his plans for Hofbräuhaus Buffalo from the Canalside District to a site near Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino. Townsell, the veteran restaurateur and founder of the Buffalo Irish Festival, confirmed he is moving his German Octoberfest-themed restaurant from a Canalside parcel at the corner of Scott and Washington streets to the former Upstate Milk Co-Operative and Bison Chip Dip plant at Scott Street and Michigan Avenue. The 60,000-square-foot plant is owned by Buffalo businessman James Sandoro . A proposed German Octoberfest-themed restaurant is now planned at the corner of Scott and… more Provided The building sits across from Ellicott Development’s Fairmont Creamery and one block from the Seneca Buffalo Creek Casino. Negotiations between Townsell and Sandoro are nearly completed, clearing the way for the $5 million restaurant/destination to begin construction. Townsell hopes to open Hofbräuhaus Buffalo by next year. He has started a private placement offering to help secure funds for the project. The move was made for a number of reasons — including concerns about the placement of underlying utilities at the Canalside site. Benderson Development is working on plans for a mixed-use building at the site that may be anchored by the region’s first Ruth Chris ’ Steakhouse. “By going down just a few blocks, we found a more suitable site,” Townsell said. The larger footprint allows Townsell to brew his own German-flavored beer on site while creating a large beer garden atmosphere that plays into the Hofbrauhaus motif. The restaurant and banquet facility would be the first Hofbräuhaus location in New York state and only one of 10 the company has franchised in the United States. “It plays off of the region’s deep German roots,” Townsell said. Buffalo has one of the largest concentration of residents with roots tracing back to Germany in the United States. Hofbräuhaus Buffalo will have a 600-seat indoor seating capacity along with a 200-seat outdoor beer garden. Customers will dine on such foods as sausage, giant pretzels, strudel and schnitzel on long wooden tables, much like those found in German beer gardens. German wheat, pilsners and lager beers, among other flavors, will be sold. All will be brewed according to Hofbräu Munich, a 500-year-old beer making, standards. Other amenities include nightly German music and other themes tied into that country. Also in the works will be a 30-room European-styled guest house, developed in the German “gasthaus” theme. Townsell said the larger building will allow his company to brew as much as 3,000 barrels of beer annually. In addition, the building allows for a potential 30,000-square-foot expansion, if needed. “We want this to mimic the Munich Hofbräuhaus,” Townsell said. Patrons will enter the beer garden from Scott Street via a decorative wrought iron entry gate that will appear like its famous Munich model. From there, guests can either sit in the outdoor beer garden and enclosed beer hall. “The goal is to make this as authentic as possible,” Townsell said. “I want people to feel like they are in Munich not Buffalo.” James Fink covers real estate, commercial development and government Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:12:32.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
