Weintraub said. 02/11/2017 11:50 am ET Hilary Hanson Trends Editor, The Huffington Post \nFederal Election Commissioner Ellen L. Weintraub threw down the gauntlet Friday, challenging President Donald Trump to provide evidence for his outlandish claims that he would have won the state of New Hampshire in the November election were it not for massive voter fraud. I call upon @POTUS to immediately share NH voter-fraud evidence so that his allegations may be investigated promptly https://t.co/cyjUTMXptk pic.twitter.com/DAnsA1cB0n — Ellen L Weintraub (@EllenLWeintraub) February 10, 2017 \n“The President has issued an extraordinarily serious and specific charge,” Weintraub said in a statement that she tweeted on Friday. “Allegations of this magnitude cannot be ignored.” \nThe voter fraud “scheme” Trump describes would “constitute thousands of felony criminal offenses under New Hampshire law,” she noted. \nShe concluded, “I therefore call upon President Trump to immediately share his evidence with the public and with the appropriate law-enforcement authorities so that his allegations may be investigated promptly and thoroughly.” \nWeintraub’s comments came after reports that Trump, during a private meeting with former Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and other senators, insisted voter fraud is the only reason that both he and Ayotte lost the state in November. Specifically, Trump alleged that “thousands” of Massachusetts residents traveled to New Hampshire to vote illegally, Politico reported. \nFergus Cullen, New Hampshire’s former GOP chair, tweeted out his own request for proof of those claims on Friday. Cullen said he would give $1,000 to the first person proving that even one out-of-state person took a bus from Massachusetts to vote in New Hampshire. I will pay $1000 to 1st person proving even 1 outofstate person took bus from MA 2 any NH polling place last ElectionDay #mapoli #nhpolitics — Fergus Cullen (@FergusCullen) February 10, 2017 \nThroughout first few weeks of his presidency, Trump has repeatedly refuted the fact that he legitimately lost the popular vote to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . He’s attributed his loss to widespread voter fraud , including voters registering as dead people, voters registering in two states and undocumented immigrants voting illegally. However, he has offered no hard proof of his claims, and officials across the country have said they found little to no evidence of fraudulent voting.
