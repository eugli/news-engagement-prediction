According to Rohit, all the four notes that he withdrew were fake. \nHe immediately brought the matter to the notice of the local police after which a sub-inspector was sent to the ATM located at the T-Point of Tigri in Sangam Vihar. \nThe sub-inspector was unable to find any other customer with a similar complaint. Therefore, he withdrew a Rs 2,000 note from the ATM which also turned out to be a fake one. \nThe Sangam Vihar police have registered a case of manufacturing documents resembling currency notes, using forged or counterfeit notes and of cheating under IPC sections 489-b, 489-e and 420.
