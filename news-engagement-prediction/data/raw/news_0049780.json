However, plans have been repeatedly delayed by setbacks and modifications, and mired in controversy. \nFor more than a year an Aboriginal tent embassy occupied the grassy block beneath the mural, protesting the gentrification of the area and the erosion of its indigenous links. \nThe protesters accused the AHC of prioritising the project's commercial aspects over the promise to build homes for indigenous families. \nLed by elder Jenny Munro, the embassy decamped from the site in August 2015, after Minister for Indigenous Affairs Nigel Scullion brokered a peace deal between the activists and AHC , amid court action to remove the protesters. As a result, the federal government committed $5 million to the project's Aboriginal housing component. \nA wire fence has since been erected around the site with signs warning trespassers to keep away.
