If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, ' Or walk with Kings – nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, If all men count with you, but none too much; If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And – which is more – you'll be a Man, my son!\"\nA photo posted by Tom Brady (@tombrady) on Feb 9, 2017 at 7:17am PST", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BQS6spfD_Ke/", "https://www.facebook.com/TomBrady/photos/a.233362006704957.53331.214003275307497/1442325202475292/?type=3&theater"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T20:12:56.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
