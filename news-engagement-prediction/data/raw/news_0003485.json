Having a relationship with computers is important. \n“However, it’s no replacement for formal education. They probably won’t be learning different languages, for instance, or different ways of doing mathematics. \n“Children need to go out and explore the world and on a psychological basis it’s essential to experience peer relationships. \n“Face-to-face communication is part of being a social animal.

Often, it’s like they have zoned out.” \n44-year-old mum, Katie, thought her children will be better educated ­entertaining themselves in cyberspace than if she taught them to read, write and count like other home schooling parents. Emma Kenny fears the children may lack socialisation \nShe said: “I don’t think the alphabet has got much to do with learning to read. \n“Games are the bedrock of what we do in our home education . Schools are far too focused on testing and exams and I prefer my children to learn through play.” \nSapphire, 12, and her two brothers Etienne, 10, and Orin, seven, get up when they feel like it and power up their Playstations to “start learning” each morning.

Sapphire sits in her room playing a game (Photo: Sunday Mirror) \nShe and Roger toyed with the idea of sending her to private school but Katie didn’t want to “just be a school run mum” . \nThe children’s education started with Sapphire learning to read aged four, using Ladybird books, while her brothers played with Lego and wooden toys. \nBut that all changed when the family bought a Nintendo Wii console six years ago and the children began to play Mario Kart. And when they discovered Minecraft – which allows users to build their own computer-generated world with bricks – their haul of computers grew.
