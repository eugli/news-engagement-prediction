This is a matter for Allah (God), over which, no one else has authority.\" \n**RESPONSE TO THE RECENT ISIS VIDEO CALLING FOR MY KILLING** In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, Most Merciful ... Posted by Sheikh Shady Alsuleiman on Monday, 13 February 2017 \nThe video, which mentioned several Muslim clerics from around the world, was a chilling and unprecedented escalation on previous calls to boycott leaders who work with governments, police and leaders of other faiths. \nThe terrorist group also condemned clerics from Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern states, who are seen to be collaborating with the regimes of those states. \nIt followed an article published in the April edition of Islamic State's Dabiq magazine that listed 21 \"imams of kufr [infidelity]\" who should be killed, including Australian doctor and charity worker Tawfique Chowdhury . \nPrevious criticisms of Sheikh Shady and the Grand Mufti have been parroted by a small band of extremists in Australia. \nA NSW Police spokesman said they were aware of the video but would not comment on safety precautions for its chaplain.
