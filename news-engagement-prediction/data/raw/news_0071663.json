It can go either ways. And the same is true for the change that Reliance has brought to the telecom market in India and Indian phones users with its Jio 4G service. The lowering of tariff may lead to more chaos in the market, and possibly poor service for consumers. Or maybe it will spur the who industry forward by making consumers happy, who will then consume more data and hence pay more. Right now it is not clear. But what is clear is that the change is definitely here. Also Read: Reliance Jio speed is now as good as Airtel's, at least in Delhi \nIn a way, Jio has turned the telecom industry upside down. For the last 5 odd months the service is free for users, which is unprecedented. After another month or so the Jio users will have to pay for it. But the charges they will pay for the Jio services are shockingly low, especially when they are Jio Prime members. \nFor now the change looks to be good, at least from the perceptive of consumers. Broadly there are two big changes Jio has brought to the market. Data price plummet \nTariffs for wirelesss data are now significantly lower. When Jio launched on September 5, other operators were offering 1GB data for around Rs 250. On Wednesday, a day after Jio Prime was launched as Rs 99 and announcement was made for the Jio plan of Rs 303 that gives users 30GB data at 4G speed and after that unlimited data at reduced speed, Airtel informed some of its post-paid users that they can subscribe to a special and surprise monthly pack of 10GB at Rs 100. \nNow, Airtel has denied that this message that reached a number of its users has anything to do with the Jio Prime. Instead, it said that the offer was part of the promotional offer that the company was running for the last few months. But it is easy to see that the data price that Airtel is charging (around Rs 10 for 1GB) was similar to the price that Jio has with its Rs 303 offer. \nIrrespective of whether there is a connection between the Jio Prime and Airtel offer or not, it is clear that the price of wireless data is in free fall in India in the last few months. Vodafone has a plan where a user can spend Rs 15 and get unlimited 4G data for 1 hour. Even if the speed of this 4G connection is around 4mbps 5mbps, users will able to easily download around 1.5GB data in this one hour. In base scenario, where the speed is around 10mbps, it is easy to leech around 3GB data within an hour. \nThen there are Airtel and Vodafone plans for postpaid and prepaid users. The plans cost the same. But now there is much more data that comes with it. Before Jio entered the picture I used to spend around Rs 750 for 3.5GB or 4GB data. Now, I am spending Rs 799 on an Airtel Infinity Plan and get 8GB data. If I subscribe to the special Rs 100 pack, I will end up getting 18GB data at a price of Rs 899 plus taxes. The bills become simpler \nThis is another big change Jio has brought. Before Jio came into the picture, telecom operators in India were charging consumers using a myriad of ways. Some users were paying 50 paisa per minute for calls. Some were paying 30 paisa. Some users were charged for messages. Some got them free. Then there were roaming charges, STD charges, local charges and etc. Jio's plan is simple. Just charge consumers some amount of money and then bundle everything in it. \nFor the last few months, we have seen that other telecom companies too have largely moved to the similar plan. Airtel's new Infinity Plans are a clear example of this. These plans are basically data plans with everything else attached to it being free. There are no roaming charges in these plans. Calls are free. 100 messages a day are free. And then there is some set amount of data that consumers get. It's that simple.

In the long run, there are too many factors. It can all go this way or that. But in the short run, as far as consumers are concerned, the market has changed for better. The phone users now get much better value for money that they spend on recharging or maintaining their phone plans.
