It sent players into a frenzy as they tried to decode any and all clues, hoping it would point them to the next hero to be added to the game. Turns out, players probably have the right idea, but not everyone was looking in the right place. \nEfi's backstory plus an alleged leak from January suggest the addition of a quadruped robot to the game. Fans scoured the web for more hints, eventually leading them to this piece of concept art, which was first shown at BlizzCon 2014: \nNaturally, some jumped to the conclusion that this must be the next hero. However, speaking at the 2017 DICE (Design, Innovate, Communicate, Entertain) summit, game director Jeff Kaplan projected the same image and said that the character in the center of the art is \"not the hero you think it is.\" \nThis makes sense to me. Personally, I think the art always looked like a human dangling from the middle of robotic spider-limbs, and other Overwatch concept art shows a pink-haired woman who matches that description quite well - something players have also pointed out . In other words, I don't think spider-lady has anything to do with Efi. \nI suggest you look to the far right of this image, at the steely blue machine at the edge of the lineup. \nCertainly looks like a quadruped tank to me. But hey, what do I know? Until Blizzard gives us something more official, we're all just fumbling in the dark on this one. \nSeen something newsworthy? !
