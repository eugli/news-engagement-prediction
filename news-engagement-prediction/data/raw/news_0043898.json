'Today' show anchor, Hoda Kotb made the announcement while trying to hold back tears of joy that she is now the mom of a baby girl, named Haley Joy. \n\"She is the love of my life,\" Hoda told her co-workers over the phone. Viewers may have noted Kotb's absence the past few shows, and now we know why! \nCongrats! — EntertainmentTonight (@etnow) February 21, 2017 ON AIR: Weekdays 10AM-3PM Wendy was 'geeking' out over radio at a super-young age, and being in awe of some her radio idols, knew it was exactly what she wanted to do. Her first internship was at 17 years-old - the summer after high school, while simultaneously working as an ice rink DJ during ‘live DJ’ night. Working her way through the ranks, Wendy eventually found her way to her dream job, hosting and entertaining the masses during the workday hours. While not on the air, Wendy has been called ‘the queen of odd hobbies.’ With a gymnastics background, she has experience in aerial arts (flying trapeze, aerial silks and static trapeze), and enjoys crafting (knitting, crocheting, jewelry & perfume making.) These days you’ll likely run into her at your local yoga studio or gym!
