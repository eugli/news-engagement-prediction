To sum up the latest development, though, a small number of folks who enrolled in that service are seeing a RCS option pop up in Google’s Messenger app. \nRCS brings quite a few features that go beyond your standard SMS experience, and when enabled, users can utilize read receipts, typing indicators, plus enhanced media (pictures, videos, etc.) sharing. However, T-Mobile already offers a feature called Advanced Messaging that is built on the RCS standards, so it’s not as if T-Mobile customers don’t have access to something that offers this. \nCurrently, Google has Sprint and Rogers enrolled to use Messenger for RCS messaging. The testing going on could be a sign that T-Mobile may soon join the ranks. \nIf you are on T-Mobile and are using DIGITS, check to see if the RCS option is available for you in the Google Messenger application.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:29:53.563+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
