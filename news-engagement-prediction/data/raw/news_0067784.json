The two women - who had not since each other since testifying against Kelly 17 years earlier - have also developed a close friendship through their campaign. Ms Jones, a hairdresser, said: 'I want to protect other people and make them aware of this change. 'Any sex offender given life on the register should not have the human right to appeal, to have that hope that one day they will have freedom. The two women - who had not since each other since testifying against Kelly 17 years earlier - have developed a close friendship through their campaign 'These people should spend the rest of their lives on the register so people know they're dangerous.' Ms Taylor said she got in touch with the South Yorkshire Police last year because she had a 'weird feeling'. 'I wanted to know what had happened to him,' she said. 'That was when I discovered that he was still alive and had actually applied to come off the sex offenders register in August. 'I felt sick and knew I had to alert his other victims.' Ms Taylor then got in touch with Miss Jones at the salon where she works. The pair had not see each other since testifying in court 17 years earlier, but were determined to prevent Kelly's name being removed. He had applied following a Supreme Court ruling which said convicted sex abusers should have the right to apply to be removed from the register after 15 years. To fight the application, the two women handed statements to a police liaison officer, outlining why his request should be rejected. In December they were told that they had been successful, meaning Kelly will remain on the register indefinitely. Ms Taylor, who is married with two sons aged ten and six, was sexually abused by Kelly when she was in his year-one class in 1985. She said: 'Primary school is supposed to be a safe place, but for me it was far from that. I was six years old and the man I trusted abused his power. 'Even after he was jailed, I suffered from anxiety and flashbacks. It pained me to know that one day he would get out of jail. Ms Jones added: 'Abuse can happen to any child at any time, and we want the topic to stop being taboo. 'If we had been educated at a young age, we might have been protected.' A South Yorkshire police spokesperson said: 'Adult offenders can apply to come off the Sex Offenders' Register after they have been subject to the requirements for 15 years, following their release from custody. 'If a person receives a prison sentence of over 30 months, they are required to notify onto the register indefinitely. The application is submitted and a decision made by the relevant police force by an officer of at least the rank of Superintendent. 'This process takes a number of factors into consideration, including a complex risk assessment and other cautions or convictions for sexual offences. It also includes checks with probation, social care and other agencies. During this time, victims are also contacted, to seek their views. 'This process is not done through court proceedings, but by officers contacting the relevant bodies and individuals over a period of usually a few weeks.'
