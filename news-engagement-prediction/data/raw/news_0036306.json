General Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA - as are three others. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 \nTrump said in a post on Twitter he was still weighing other potential candidates for the White House job. \n“General Keith Kellogg, who I have known for a long time, is very much in play for NSA - as are three others,” Trump said. He gave no other details about any of the contenders. \nAccording to two sources familiar with Harward’s decision, the senior executive at Lockheed Martin declined the offer in part because he wanted to bring in his own team. \nTrump has said that Flynn’s deputy, K.T. McFarland, could stay. \n(Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Frances Kerry) Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post? Here’s how.
