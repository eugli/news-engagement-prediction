They both dismissed those emphatically reports at CPAC on Thursday. \nRelated: What the heck is Ed Schultz doing at CPAC? \n\"If you look at the opposition party,\" Bannon said referring to the media, \"and how they portray the campaign, how they portrayed the transition, and how they are portraying the administration, it's always wrong. Just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the campaign, and just like they were dead wrong on the chaos of the transition, they are absolutely dead wrong about what's going on today.\" \nPresident Donald Trump's first month in office has been typified by his ongoing anatgonism toward the press. Bannon has clearly influenced that tenor, consistently referring the media as \"the opposition party\" -- a term that has been adopted by Trump. On Thursday, Bannon seemed to go out of his way to invoke the label. \nShortly after taking the stage, Schlapp pointed to the back of the ballroom, where members of the media had gathered to cover the event. \nRelated: CPAC kicks off the Trump era, but conservative divisions remain \n\"Is that the opposition party?\" Bannon asked. \nA bit later in the program, Bannon again wielded the term. \n\"President Trump, when he was running -- and this is the other thing that the mainstream media, or the opposition party, never caught,\" Bannon said. \"If you want to see the Trump agenda, it's very simple. It's all in the speeches.\" \nCNNMoney (National Harbor, Maryland)   4:10 PM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:38:48.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
