The mother and baby are well,” he told The Star . \nMicrocephaly is a rare condition where a baby is born with a small head or the head stops growing after birth. \nIt can occur with no other major birth defects but severe microcephaly can result in a baby’s brain not developing properly during pregnancy, or it develops correctly but is damaged at some point during pregnancy. \nIn September, the mother from Taman Desa Harmoni, whose husband worked in Singapore where the infection was at its height there then, was the third person to be tested positive. \nShe was over three months pregnant when she showed signs of fever, rashes and body aches. \nHer husband was later confirmed as the fourth patient to be infected. The man in his 30s was a chef in Singapore and commutes there daily. \nDr Noor Hisham said that there was no documented cases of microcephaly associated with the Zika virus in Malaysia as of today. \nThe other pregnant woman who tested positive for Zika was the fifth patient – a 36-year-old woman in Miri, Sarawak. \nShe was admitted to hospital in September after complaining of prolonged fever, flu and sore throat. \nThe ministry had said that the two pregnant mothers were being closely monitored by their obstetrics and gynaecology specialists in their respective states. \nIn total, eight people tested positive for Zika in Malaysia. \nAll the patients were well at the point of discharge from hospital except for one patient who died of heart complications while in hospital. \nZika was declared a global health emergency in February 2016 by the World Health Organisation. \nBy Nov 18, it declared that Zika no longer posed a world public health emergency but warned that it remained a challenge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:40:15.464+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
