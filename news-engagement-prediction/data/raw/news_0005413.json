During the takeover, the group of inmates made various telephone calls to parties outside the detention center, including the Delaware News Journal. \nAccording to KYW-TV , who obtained a copy of the audio, one of the inmates can be heard blaming the hostage situation on Trump, explaining the men were fearful after his election. \n“We’re trying to explain our reasons for doing what we’re doing. Donald Trump, everything that he did, all the things that he’s doing now…We know that the institution’s gonna change for the worse,” the inmate said. He did not name any specific actions from Trump that led the inmates to conclude that. \nIn the calls provided to KYW-TV, the inmates also reportedly referenced the need for more education and rehabilitation within the prison system. \nInmates in the C building of the James T. Vaughn Correction Center in Smyrna, Delaware took the officers hostage Wednesday morning, resulting in a hostage standoff situation that lasted nearly 20 hours. \nThe inmate who referenced President Trump can be heard below, courtesy of KYW-TV.
