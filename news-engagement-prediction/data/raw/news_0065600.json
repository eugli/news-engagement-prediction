Announced via release, Balls Out Burger will open its doors in a building that was once a gas station on Durham Drive near the Heights. The restaurant will, not surprisingly, serve up a menu of “high quality burgers” and “local craft beers,” plus a typical bar vibe with plenty of TVs for watching sports and a porch where you can drink all that beer that Balls Out Burger will be serving up. If you’d like something a little fancier than a restaurant named after testicles, Tucker will also open a restaurant-cocktail bar concept called Poitín (pronounced “put-cheen”) later this year at Sawyer Yards in the Washington Avenue Arts District. Described as a “concept driven cocktail bar,” Poitín will serve approachably-priced craft libations and food (menu is, at present, TBD). As for the man behind these two new Houston concepts, Tucker brings a background in hospitality and restaurant ownership from Ireland, where he was born and raised. In Dublin, Tucker opened a much-lauded gastropub called The Exchequer, along with a wine bar of the same name. How the hell did he end up all the way in Houston from Ireland? His wife, who he met while she was vacationing, lives here. No opening dates have been announced yet for either Balls Out Burger or Poitín, but both concepts are expected to arrive before the year is out.
