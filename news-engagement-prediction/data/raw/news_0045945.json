Essendon Airport, which is used mainly by light aircraft, remained closed. \nThe Australian Transport Safety Bureau will investigate the crash. \n(Reporting by Tom Westbrook; Editing by Paul Tait and Simon Cameron-Moore) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:18:03.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
