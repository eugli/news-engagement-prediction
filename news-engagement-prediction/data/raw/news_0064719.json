Trump administration mulls tweaking NAFTA trade numbers By Erica Alini National Online Journalist, Money/Consumer Global News \nThe administration of President Donald Trump is reportedly considering tweaks to the country's trade statistics that would magnify its trade deficit with Canada and Mexico.

The move is likely meant to strengthen the administration’s political case for renegotiating trade deals. \nREAD MORE: Can Donald Trump promise to tweak NAFTA? Trade experts say no \nThe idea is to exclude “re-exports” when calculating U.S. international trade balances. Re-exports are goods that were first imported into a country, usually for assembly or processing, and then exported again. It is standard practice to calculate re-exports as parts of a country’s exports, and that is how Statistics Canada tracks Canada’s trade flows. \nWATCH: How to renegotiate NAFTA and get a better deal from the U.S. \nU.S. reports noted that, if the U.S. were to adopt the new method of computation, the country’s trade deficit with Mexico would nearly double. \nBut the optics would deteriorate considerably for Canada as well, Global News calculations shows. \nFor 2016, the U.S. trade deficit with Canada would grow fivefold, from US$11.2 billion (C$14.8 billion) to US$56.8 billion (C$75.2 billion), according data from the U.S. Census Bureau. \nMexico would see its deficit swell from just over US$63 billion (C$83.4 billion) to nearly US$117 billion (C$155 billion). \nREAD MORE: As Trudeau meets Trump, will Canada abandon Mexico? \nWhile the size of the U.S. trade imbalance with Canada would still look far smaller than Mexico’s, the deficit-magnifying effect of ignoring re-exports is far greater for Canada. \nIt’s unclear whether the proposed change, which has reportedly met resistance from career government officials at the U.S. Trade Representative’s office, would affect Canada. \nTrump told Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during his visit to Washington earlier this month that Mexico, not Canada, is the focus of the administration’s efforts to amend NAFTA. Such assurances were widely seen as a major political win for the Trudeau government. \nWATCH: Ambrose asks what PM Trudeau’s tweaks to NAFTA will be \n“I was encouraged from the comment from President Trump when he referred to tweaks to NAFTA,” Canada’s Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne told Bloomberg in a recent interview. \n“There’s an acknowledgment that we just don’t sell to each other, we make things together, and for me this was very encouraging because this is an agreement that has been good for the middle class,” continued Champagne. \nBut bilateral tensions remain on a number of NAFTA-related questions, such as Canada’s regime for dairy and lumber. \nREAD MORE: Defining ‘tweaking’: Unpacking the politics after Trudeau, Trump meeting \nU.S. dairies are already eyeing Trump as a potential ally in the fight against Canada’s dairy quotas and import tariffs. \nNew, skewed trade statistics could give political fodder to U.S. domestic lobbies with longstanding grudges against Canada’s NAFTA terms. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
