As soon as you hit that magic 28 there’s a bonus ... Basically you’ve got to get 28 conviction statements before you can start hitting extra money.”\nHe joked that the job involved “attacking poor unsuspecting victims”. \nThe BBC told Capita to investigate the claims and “ensure swift and appropriate action” was taken. It confirmed that Capita operated an incentive scheme for enforcement officers, but insisted that this should only apply to licence fee sales and not prosecution statements as the undercover footage suggested.\nA BBC spokesman said: “We are very disappointed by the conduct of Capita’s interviewing managers in this particular case, which is not in line with the high standards we expect and does not reflect the policies in place.”\nIt added: “We have asked Capita to investigate urgently and ensure swift and appropriate action is taken. We expect inquiry officers to behave in a courteous, professional manner and abide by a published code of conduct.”\nA spokeswoman for Capita said: “Inquiry officers are expected to act in a professional manner, abide by strict rules of conduct and adhere to the Pace [Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984] code of practice and we strongly refute any allegation that inquiry officers are instructed to act outside of these requirements.”\nShe added: “The comments made by these individuals do not reflect the culture, skills and attitude of TVL’s operation. We have a strong set of procedures in place and should we find employees have not acted as they should we act appropriately. We are investigating.”\nThe House of Commons culture, media and sports committee is to raise the issue with both Capita and the BBC.\nDowning Street said ministers would raise questions about the conduct of the enforcement officers with the BBC. \n“Clearly, these are concerning reports. The licence fee does need to be collected in a fair and reasonable manner. I see the BBC has quite rightly ordered an urgent investigation into these reports,” a No 10 spokesman said.\nAfter the undercover footage was recorded, Capita realised that the reporter’s CV was fake and so refused to give him job as a Capita field officer, a Capita source said. The source accused the Daily Mail of acting in a “deceptive manner”. \nCapita’s incentive scheme did not reward the collection of prosecution statements, the source added.\nTory MP Andrew Bridgen condemned Capita’s incentive scheme and said it “further increases the pressure to decriminalise those evading what amounts to a TV tax”.\nHe added: “I’m not in the least surprised. My constituents have complained to me of being treated very aggressively by those acting on behalf of the BBC to collect the TV licence.\n“The shocking things is that BBC doesn’t appear to know how those collecting the fees are operating.”\nAnyone with a television or who watches iPlayer without a licence can be fined up to £1,000 and given a criminal record. The government has threatened to revive plans to decriminalise non-payment in a move that could cost the corporation £200m a year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T17:08:18.472+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
