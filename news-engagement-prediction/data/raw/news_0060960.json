She was a heroin addict and now works as an addictions outreach worker in Calgary. \n“They try something once and they’re hooked. It’s just recreational at first and it turns into an addiction. That’s what happened with me.” \nLast year in Alberta, 343 people died from apparent fentanyl overdoses, up from 257 in 2015 and 117 in 2014. \n“It’s a very terrifying time to use drugs right now.” \nJessica Holtsbaum lost her brother Nathan Huggins-Rosenthal to a fentanyl overdose last February. \nThe 35-year-old was a Calgary stockbroker and had recently bought a house with his girlfriend. \n“Drugs don’t discriminate,” Holtsbaum said. “He had a back injury and he was prescribed OxyContin. And things just went down from there.” Powerful stories here for #NationalDayofAction . Jessica lost her brother to fentanyl.

Everyone that is using drugs, they’re people too. \n“They have mothers, they have fathers, they have people that love them and they started somewhere.” \nREAD MORE: Alberta gives firefighters access to naloxone kits as fentanyl overdose deaths rise \nBurnham said she’d like to see supervised consumption sites open up across the country. \nAlberta has been inching towards the idea. Last fall, the province said it would explore the idea of setting up medically-supervised injection services. It still needs federal approval under current drug laws. \n“You can go to many pharmacies and access a naloxone kit but more needs to be done. It’s still not enough. People are still dying,” Burnham said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:07:08.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
