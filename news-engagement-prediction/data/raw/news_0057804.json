The space agency will have a number of panelists on hand for the announcement, including Sean Carey — the manager of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at Caltech — and Sara Seager — a notable expert in the study of exoplanets from MIT. People are encouraged to ask questions to the panelists through Twitter, using the hashtag #askNASA, and if you have even more questions once the announcement is over, there will be a followup Reddit AMA at 3PM ET. We can answer one question for you now though: it’s not aliens. (It never is.) Still, the discovery promises to be super cool and could help with our search for extraterrestrial life moving forward.
