NASA's Marshall Spaceflight Center \nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. â€” The Trump administration has directed NASA to study whether it is feasible to fly astronauts on the debut flight of the agency's heavy-lift rocket, a mission currently unmanned and targeted to launch in late 2018, officials said on Friday. \nThe study marks the Republican president's first step in shaping a vision for the space agency. \nUnder President Barack Obama, NASA was working on the heavy-lift Space Launch System rocket and Orion deep-space capsule with the aim of sending astronauts to rendezvous with an asteroid in the mid-2020s, followed by a human expedition to Mars in the 2030s. \nThe request for the study from the new administration tweaks that plan by exploring whether to add a crew to an earlier test flight and perhaps setting the stage for a human return to the moon. \nNASA officials said they do not feel compelled to fly the test mission with crew aboard, Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's head of human space flight, told reporters on a conference call. \n\"There's not pressure to go do this,\" Gerstenmaier said. \"I find it encouraging that we were asked to go do this feasibility study.\" \nThe study is expected to take about a month. \nEngineers are assessing hardware changes, schedule delays, additional costs and increased risks of flying a two-member crew on the first flight of the Space Launch System rocket, which is about four times bigger and more powerful than any current US booster. \nAn illustration of the Orion spacecraft. silodrome.co \nThe astronauts would fly aboard an Orion capsule, under development by Lockheed Martin Corp, and swing around the moon during an eight- to nine-day mission, similar to what the Apollo 8 crew accomplished in 1968. \nGerstenmaier said adding crew to the mission would not be worthwhile if it forced the flight to be delayed more than about a year. \nThe rocket's second flight, which is to include crew, is targeted for August 2021. The study will explore what would be gained technically by having a crew aboard sooner. Read the original article on Reuters . Copyright 2017. Follow Reuters on Twitter .
