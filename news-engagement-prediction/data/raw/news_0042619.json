They called her a whore. They mocked her accent and her religion. \nMrs. Trump petitioned God on behalf of the nation in her first public remarks as our nation’s First Lady. \nShe recited The Lord’s Prayer over the weekend at a rally in Florida — and just like my pastor did at church on Sunday, she referred to notes during the recitation. (More on that below.) \nHere is the transcript to her speech: \n\"Thank you. Let us pray. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed is your name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespasses against us. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever. Amen. \n\"Good afternoon. It is my honor and great pleasure to stand here before you as the First Lady of the United States. The mid— the America we envision is one that works for all Americans, and where all Americans can work and succeed. A nation committed to a greater civility and unity between people from all sides of the political divide. I will always stay true to myself and be truthful to you, no matter what the opposition is saying about me. \n\"I will act in the best interest of all of you. I am committed to creating and supporting initiatives geared to my heart, which will have impacts on women and children all around the world. View Cartoon \n\"My husband is creating a country of great safety and prosperity. Ladies and gentlemen, I’m proud to introduce the President of the United States, Donald Trump.\" \nSupporters at Orlando-Melbourne Airport received the prayer with “ thunderous applause ” — but liberals took to Twitter to tear her down every way you could possibly think of — and ones you can’t even imagine. \nInstead of linking to their tweets and giving them anymore light of day, I’m just going to quote the vile tweets: \nJaime Primak (@JaimePrimak) tweeted: “Melania starts the dictatorship rally with the Lord’s Prayer? NOT EVERY AMERICAN IS CHRISTIAN!!!! Country over party.” \nA little over the top, don’t you think? Especially for a Christian-majority nation. \nAdrian Short ( @adrianshort) had this attack: “With an hour’s practice I could probably say the Lord’s Prayer better in Slovene than Melania Trump does it in English.” \nThankfully, we’ll never have to find out because Mrs. Trump is our First Lady and her English is fine. \nAccording to Nicole Angeleen ( @NicoleAngeleen) , reading the Lord’s Prayer off a piece of paper nullifies what Jesus did on the cross… \nShe tweeted: “I could recite the Our Father backwards, drugged with a gun to my head. If you need to read this prayer, you’re not Christian (re: Melania).” \nMs. Nicole, I’m glad you can recite the Our Father under duress, just wish you could walk out your faith with no pressure on social media. \nThe Wrap’s senior entertainment reporter, Matt Donnelly ( @MattDonnelly) , had these words: “The way Melania choked through that Our Father tells me she has not spoken aloud for weeks.” \nThat had Hollywood elitist written all over it. \nSelf-proclaimed “progressive secular humanist” Michael Stone wrote on Patheos that Mrs. Trump committed an act of “Christofascism,” adding the “mail-order bride paid lip service to a God that does not exist.” \nSo much for progress. Remind me again how calling the First Lady a “mail-order bride” advances things.All in all, Melania Trump did not call for the beheading of infidels or a violent crusade, she simply recited a prayer that Christians say daily around the world. One that calls for heaven to come down. One that calls for forgiveness. It’s not a controversial prayer. \nThe First Lady spoke out for the first time since assuming the office, and instead of listening to her, they immediately attacked her like a pack of ravenous wolves. \nRemember when former First Lady Michelle Obama said, “When they go low, we go high”? \nYeah, that didn’t last long. \nInstead of sinking lower and lower, the Left could borrow a lesson from the Good Book and show Mrs. Trump a little grace.
