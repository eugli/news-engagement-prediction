Photograph: David Davies/PA Exams Independent school pupils more likely to get extra time in exams \nResearch suggests nearly 20% of pupils in independent sector got extra time last year, compared with under 12% of state counterparts   Friday 10 February 2017 09.23 GMT Last modified on Friday 10 February 2017 09.25 GMT \nIndependent school pupils are significantly more likely to receive extra time to complete their exams, according to analysis of GCSE and A-level entries last year. \nThe research suggests that one in five students in independent schools received extra time to complete GCSE and A-level exams last year, compared with one in eight in their state counterparts. Pupils receive additional time due to a range of special educational needs or learning disabilities such as dyslexia. \nAccording to analysis by BBC Radio 4’s Today programme , extra time was given to more than 27,000 independent school students in last year’s GCSE and A-level exams – nearly 20% of all pupils in the sector. \nIn contrast, in the state sector, 200,000 students received extra time, less than 12% of all such pupils taking the exams. \nSpeaking on the Today programme on Friday, Peter Hamilton, headteacher at the Haberdashers’ Aske’s boys’ school, said the figures represented a “good news story”. \n“For a long period of time, people have been getting better and better at identifying pupils’ special needs,” he said. “It’s a wonderful thing we’re now noticing some of these problems and beginning to get pupils to get fairness when they sit their examinations.” A-level and GCSE grade changes down a quarter after re-mark overhaul Read more \nAsked if the gap between independent and state students was “suspicious”, Hamilton replied: “No, on the contrary, it’s not. It’s all to do with better tracking, better diagnosis, responding to pupil need.” \nBut Lucy Powell, the former Labour shadow education secretary, described the difference as “alarming”. \n“I don’t know what the levels should be and what I think is worrying, in fact probably alarming, is the discrepancy between the independent sector and the state school sector,” she said on Today. \nPowell said Ofqual, the examinations regulator, should be looking at why the gap exists. \n“It’s their job to look at and to make sure there is not an unfair advantage for whatever reason for those children,” she said. \n“Across the independent sector there are fewer children with special educational needs, around 14%, and in the state sector it’s around 16%, so the independent sector are outperforming doubly themselves in getting this extra support in exams. \n“It’s Ofqual’s job – and if it’s not their job then the [Department for Education] should make it their job – to make sure there’s a level playing field here.” \nHMC, a group representing independent schools, told the BBC the higher rate was down to “proper resourcing” which it said “can be lacking in state maintained schools”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T16:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:36:04.241+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
