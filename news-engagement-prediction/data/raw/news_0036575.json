Now Debra is stepping into the spotlight with a special of her own, Being Debra , which premieres tonight on MTV, a new business venture — she’s rapping and starting her own record label — and a new engagement. (Yes, to David, the guy who was so polarizing on last season that meeting him sent Farrah and Debra to family counseling.) Here, Debra discusses her hip-hop aspirations, her relationship with her her daughter, and how being on Teen Mom OG has changed her life.\n Tell me about your new special. It’s going to be fun! I think people will laugh and I think they'll be inspired.\nWhat do you think we’ll be inspired by? I tend to be a person that is tenacious, so even though things look like they're going south or they're going in the wrong direction, I have a positive attitude, and I try to make lemonade out of lemons.\nYou talk in the special about dropping a rap single too and you've released a video for it. Tell me about that. To me, rap music is talking about what's real, what's affecting people. I love it, I take it seriously and I think it's “bring people together” music. I started really listening to Drake and Nicki Minaj and people like that. I’m inspired by their honesty. I'm inspired by how hard they work. A lot of people don't take rap seriously, they don't see it as hard work. When they think about opera or they think about classics, they think that's really hard, that takes a lot of work. Well, let me tell you what: So does rap.", "external_links": ["http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/farrah-abrahams-mom-debra-debuts-rap-music-video-debz-og-w467232", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/debra-02-1487185710.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/debra-02-1487185710.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=768:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/debra-02-1487185710.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"], "published": "2017-02-15T16:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:08:47.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
