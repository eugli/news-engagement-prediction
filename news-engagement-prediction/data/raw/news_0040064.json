Brianna wants to work, but says she's constantly turned down.\n“Nobody wants to hire someone who they know is going to be leaving in a few months because they’re pregnant.”\nThe Salvation Army is one of the only local agencies working to help young homeless families like Brianna's.\nThey pack lunches and provide free laundry service. They're trying to help Brianna find her own apartment and are coaching her on tenants' rights. For now though, life is difficult.\n“It's between a place to live and a place to eat. You can't do both nowadays on assistance; it's impossible,” Melissa says.\n“You fall on hard times so people give dirty looks,” says Brianna. “There's always someone who will have an opinion on it.”\nShe insists she'll eventually find a home and go to college.\n“I'm hoping to study to be a child and youth worker because I like working with children.”\nBrianna says staying positive is important, as is realizing you're not alone.\nRelated Stories Agencies alarmed by the number of young homeless parents Photos Melissa and Brianna can be seen in Barrie, Ont. on Wednesday, Feb. 15, 2017.
