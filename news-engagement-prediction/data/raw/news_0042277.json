The next few times, they begrudgingly order (and finish) a beer by the time you sprint in with your expected \"OMG, so sorry, hope you didn't wait too long!\" fare.\n2. If you end up dating long-term, your S.O. will start calling you out on it ~all the time~.\nhttp://fivesostext.tumblr.com/post/154371359899/ive-forgotten-what-you-look-like-luke4-hey Not that you don't completely deserve it, but ugh, do they even know you?\n3. Your partner will learn to do their own math when meeting up with you.\nJust tell me when and where and I'll be there 20 minutes late\n‚Äî expreslve üéÉ (@EXPRESlVE) July 2, 2016 This may or may not involve some white lies about the movie starting at 7:15 when it's an 8 p.m. show time.\n4.
