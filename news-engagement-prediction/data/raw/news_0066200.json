Described as sensual and flirty, this fruity – gourmand Eau de Toilette combines sparkling fresh notes with delicious sweets. The scent itself returns unchanged, yet in a new packaging. \"ANGEL EAU SUCRÉE is an ode to sweet indulgence. Sensual and mischievous, EAU SUCRÉE concentrates the aromas of confectionery treats in a swirl of tangy freshness and tantalizingly sweet indulgence. The sugar-coated star glitters with the promise of tangy, decadent delight. \" The composition of Angel Eau Sucrée is signed Dorothee Piot . The sparkling top notes of \"Acidulous Delight\" include red berries sorbet, along with some citrus fruits. Caramelized meringue cream is at the \"Sugary Delight\" heart of the perfume, based on the \"Voluptuous Delight\" of patchouli and vanilla. This year's bottle is coated in a slightly shimmering cobalt blue glaze. The box is decorated with blue and silver stripes, inspired by the codes of traditional confections. It is available from February 2017 as a 50 ml Eau de Toilette . \nSanja Pekić \nSanja joined the Fragrantica team in 2009 and writes and designs articles about perfume news.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:16:33.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
