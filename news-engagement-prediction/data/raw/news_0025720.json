Mesut Ozil suffering CRISIS of confidence, admits Arsenal boss Wenger \nFollowing Arsenal’s 2-0 win over Hull on Saturday, Wenger dismissed Wright’s comments and indicated he expects to stay on. \n‘I could be tired because I get up early in the morning and I finish late at night!’ said the 67-year-old. \n‘But I didn’t give any indication about my future. \n‘I appreciate very much that you want me to rest, absolutely, but I’m not ready for that.’ Wenger will be back on the touchline after completing his four-match ban in the win over Hull (Getty) \nWright, who played under Wenger during the French tactician’s early days with Arsenal, stood by his prediction though. \n‘Well I got the tiredness right. The thing is, it was a question and answer, and it was a really good evening,’ he explained on Match of the Day. \n‘The way the boss was speaking, talking about coming to the end, his demeanour, and the way it was going – it was my opinion. I could be wrong, seldom am, but the fact is that’s what I based it on and I stick by it. \n‘I think with everything that’s going on, there is some tough games coming up and I still think he has got some massive decisions to make, and I still think this might be his last season, I genuinely do.’ Wright stands by his claim (Getty) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:40:10.375+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
