It was pathetic.\" \nThe lack of food and water was a constant source of anxiety for desert troops. \nThe officers showered every day, while the soldiers were rationed a single cup of water. \nSometimes for food, they resorted to eating flesh from camels that had been blown up by landmines. \nRick says the best moment of the war for him was being captured by British and Australian forces. With a few thousand other Italian soldiers, he was sent to Australia as a prisoner of war. \nIt was during his time as a POW that Rick's love affair with Australia began. Photo: Rick says he has had a deep affinity with Australia since he first arrived as a POW. (ABC RN: Tiger Webb) \nDuring the war, with so many workers away fighting, there was a labour shortage in Australia. \nThe shortfall was made up by POWs from Germany, Italy and Japan who were held in camps here. \nThey built roads, worked in agriculture and forestry. Rick was sent to a farm in Sutton Forest, in the New South Wales southern highlands, where he worked for 18 months. \nEach day he grew fonder of the Australian bush and his employers, Mr and Mrs Badgery. \nRick was aged 21 when the war ended. \nAs the Australian soldiers returned, the POWs were sent back to the camps to await repatriation. \nRick was in a camp near St Ives, Sydney, and the thought of eventually returning to a decimated Italy after the relative freedom of life on an Australian farm held little appeal. Dream sequence \nDreams have always been and still are a major part of Rick's life. They've led him to make decisions on investments, friendships, relationships, and in 1946, a horse in the Melbourne Cup. \nRick says he dreamt that a horse called Russia would win. He compelled some prison guards to bet a few shillings for him on the horse and it went on to win. \nHe then convinced the same guards to buy him civilian clothes with his winnings. \nWhen they asked him why, he told them he was planning to escape. They had underestimated him. \nAfter receiving a hat, a coat and some trousers, Rick, like approximately 300 other prisoners of war from various camps, went on the run. \nHe made his way to Lismore where he worked on a banana farm and then returned to Sydney where he lived under a false identity. \nAn amnesty was offered to all outstanding prisoners. If they gave themselves up, they'd receive a free passage home and the right to apply to migrate back to Australia should they want to. \nRick returned to Italy but he hated it. \n\"The streets were so small; the buildings were dilapidated,\" he says. \nHis heart was in Australia, where he thought he could truly grow. \nTwo years after he'd left, Rick returned to Australia, initially to the Badgerys' farm and then to Sydney where he tried to make a go of it. \nHe made timber crates during the week and tended gardens on the weekends. \nThen he saw an opportunity to make a little extra money on the side, designing and planting a garden for a new hospital at Kogarah. \nWorking day and night Rick made enough money to buy a small cottage in Marrickville, which he improved and flipped. \n\"I never looked back after that,\" he says. Photo: At 96, Rick Pisaturo retains an incredible zeal for life. (ABC RN: Tiger Webb) \nWithin a year or two he'd flipped 18 houses, then purchased a Kings Cross apartment block. \nWith a real estate licence, he was not only buying and selling houses, but building hundreds of homes in Sydney's western suburbs. \nEver since he worked with Mr and Mrs Badgery, he'd wanted to breed pedigree cattle and import European breeds, specifically Charolais and Chianina. \nHis success in real estate gave him the means to purchase a large plot of land in the western districts of Sydney, where he established Mandalong Stud. \nHe began importing and breeding. At first other cattle breeders were sceptical, but they too underestimated him. \nIn just a few short years, Rick was being recognised as a pedigree beef stud cattle breeder. \nHis collection of trophies, ribbons and awards for cattle breeding fills a large room on his property. \nHis contribution to the Australian cattle industry was so significant that in 1990, almost 50 years after Rick had first arrived in Australia as a POW, he was awarded the Order of Australia. \nNow 96, Rick remains a man of remarkable energy with a boundless zest for life who shows no sign of slowing down, nor looking to the past. \n\"Whatever you've done, you've already done it. But the future you can change if you don't like it,\" he says.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:28:22.250+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
