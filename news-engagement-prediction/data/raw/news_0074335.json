It's growing upwards and outwards. We'll have to book her in for her first trim soon enough. 'Everyday from day one she has had to have it oiled - with the oil is left in for a bit then combed through - then washed, dried and brushed. Little Amelia already has an impressive bouffant and was even born with a full head of hair (left) Mum Kayleigh said: 'We got the shock of our lives when she came out and had all this hair' Amelia's dad Jonathan Lunn, 28, has nicknamed her Mr T due to her crazy hairdo 'She absolutely loves being pampered. Her little face when she's having her hair washed and blow dried is so cute. 'I dread to think what she'll be like when she's older. She's only ten weeks old and she's already got a strict daily hair regime. She's going to be so high maintenance. 'When she hasn't had it washed and everything it forms into a proper Mohican. It is so funny - her dad calls her Mr T because of it.' Amelia's fuzzy barnet, which is already long enough to be styled with cute clips and grips, attracts quite a lot of attention. In total, her routine takes a mammoth two and a half hours to complete - five minutes to apply the oil, two hours to leave it in, two ten minute washes and a five minute blow dry. The tot has her hair oiled and blowdryed every day - and the process takes over two hours in total Kayleigh said: 'Everywhere we go, people are stunned by Amelia's hair' The 22-year-old said the amount of time the tot's hair needs to be brushed a day frequently reaches double figures. Mum Kayleigh said she has heard strangers 'gasp' at the sight of her little girl's adorable mop when she takes off her hat in cafes and restaurants. Kayleigh said: 'Everywhere we go, people are stunned by Amelia's hair. Friends, family and strangers all come over or comment on it. 'There have been times I've gone into a cafe and she's had a hat on and when I've taken off the hat there have been audible gasps from people in the room. 'I don't think anyone has ever seen such a little baby with so much hair before, they can't believe it. 'But she actually looks just like I did when I was born. She just takes after her mum.'
