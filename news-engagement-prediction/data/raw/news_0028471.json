Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images After her mesmerizing Grammys performance , Beyoncé returned to the mortal world to accept her Grammy for Best Urban Contemporary Album. Reading, of course, from a gold card that matched her outfit, Beyoncé thanked “everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep Southern culture” and elaborated on the mission of Lemonade , which was to allow children to see themselves, and their beauty, reflected in her work.\nRead her full remarks below:\nThank you to the Grammy voters for this incredible honor. Thank you everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep Southern culture. I thank God for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter, my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support. \n\nWe all experience pain and loss and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that will give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness, and our history – to confront issues that make us uncomfortable. \n\nIt’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror – first through their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House, and the Grammys, and see themselves, and have no doubt that they’re beautiful, intelligent, and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel it’s vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes.\nTags: beyonce grammys 2017 awards music lemonade Beyoncé Gives Moving Grammy Acceptance Speech Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Here Are Your 2017 Grammy Winners Frank Ocean Fires Back at the ‘Faulty’ Grammys for Their ‘Cultural Bias’ Leslie Jones Really Wants to Play Donald Trump Most Viewed Stories Jake Tapper Has a One-Word Response to SNL’s Unhinged Fatal Attraction Sketch Rosie O’Donnell Won’t Be Playing Steve Bannon on SNL Everyone Performing at the 2017 Grammys The Meanest Lines From the Fifty Shades Darker Reviews What’s New on Netflix: February 2017 What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO Kellyanne Conway Isn’t Going to Be Ignored in Her Very Own Fatal Attraction Parody Piers Morgan Told to ‘F*ck Off’ for Dismissing Trump Fears As ‘Hysteria’ on Real Time With Bill Maher Melissa McCarthy’s Sean Spicer Returns to SNL in the Hope of Becoming Calm Saturday Night Live Recap: Alec Baldwin and Melissa McCarthy Keep It Spicey Damien Chazelle Says Studio Wanted Whiplash , a Movie About a Drummer, to Cool It With All of the Drumming Most Popular Video On Vulture The Best Bloopers From Friends Latest News from Vulture 13 mins ago Girls Season Premiere Recap: She’s So High Is Hannah Horvath finally growing up?\n17 mins ago Beyoncé Gives Moving Grammy Acceptance Speech “It’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty.”\n28 mins ago Why Girls Is So Good When It Leaves New York City Outside, everything is clearer, simpler, more candid.\n30 mins ago Katy Perry Pays Homage to Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Warren at 2017 Grammys She wore an armband that said, simply, “Persist.”\n10:13 p.m. The Walking Dead Recap: Turn That Frown Upside Down “Rock in the Road” has one of the show’s greatest zombie slaughter scenes.\n10:05 p.m. 2017 NAACP Image Awards: Beyoncé, Moonlight , and Black-ish Win Big Read the full 2017 NAACP Image Award winner list.\n10:03 p.m. Watch Beyoncé Perform of ‘Love Drought’ and ‘Sandcastles’ at the Grammys She performed “Love Drought” and “Sandcastles.”\n10:00 p.m. Victoria Recap: A Man of Principle Teamwork makes the dream work, Victoria!\n10:00 p.m. The Young Pope Recap: The World Is Always Ready for Love Cardinal Gutierrez isn’t doing so hot in New York.\n10:00 p.m. Homeland Recap: Whistleblowers It’ll be very interesting to see where Homeland goes from here.\n9:42 p.m. Here Are Your 2017 Grammy Winners Who’s collecting golden gramophones?\n9:23 p.m. When SNL Makes Fart Jokes and the Audience Expects Donald Trump Resistance SNL had a classic meh episode when the expectations were higher than ever.\n9:09 p.m. Girls Changed Hannah’s Look After Judd Apatow Noted She Looked ‘Too Attractive’ “Her outfit is too cute, her hair and makeup looks too good.
