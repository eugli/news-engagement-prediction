The list included major news stories such as the attacks in San Bernardino , Orlando , Paris and Nice . \nNoah noted on Tuesday’s “The Daily Show” that the Trump list didn’t include any terrorist attacks carried out by white extremists, such as the recent attack on Muslims inside a Quebec City mosque that killed six people, or the church shooting in Charleston, South Carolina, in June 2015. \n“During the campaign, Trump promised ‘America first.’ Now he’s ignoring all the hard-working white America terrorists?” Noah asked. “I guess the forgotten man has been forgotten after all.” Also on HuffPost How To Get Into The Conspiracy Theory Game How To Get Into The Conspiracy Theory Game 1 of 7 Become exceedingly adequate in Microsoft Paint.
