S. Embassy at 2 pm on Thursday, February 23, and will hold a quiet and respectful demonstration on the public space in front of the embassy. Mark your calendar and be ready to to attend on a moment’s notice.” \nThe petition, posted on the far-left website MoveOn.org, received approximately 1,430 signatures. \n“As no one else, those of us Americans who are concerned about these policies, and who also make our homes in Mexico, are in a unique position to provide the Secretary of State a viewpoint that he might not receive in Washington, D.C.” the petition said. “We call on Secretary Tillerson to meet with us at a time and place of his convenience during his visit.” \nDoug Hall, listed as both the organizer of the protest and the creator of the petition, has been cited in Mexican news outlets as an employee with Democrats Abroad. \nDemocrats Abroad Mexico is chaired by Jodie Quinnell, who served as a delegate for Hillary Clinton at the Democratic National Convention. \nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders handedly defeated Clinton in the Democrats Abroad primary, including in Mexico where he earned 848 votes compared to Clinton’s 535. \nThe Republican Party’s formal organization dedicated to outreach among Americans living abroad, Republicans Abroad, dissolved in 2013, leaving individual country chapters to fend for themselves as independent entities.
