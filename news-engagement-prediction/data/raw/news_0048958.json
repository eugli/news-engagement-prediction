'What you see is the dog being thrown across the floor of the landing and struck at least twice and spat at,' Mr Turner told the bench. 'The dog keeps running away and not coming to heel, probably with good reason, while the defendant chases after it.' He is seen kicking the animal twice in the footage and even spits at the dog, despite telling magistrates he 'loves animals' The bull terrier looks shaken as it is eventually seen following Cheshire out of the lift Mr Turner said the dog, a bull terrier-type, ran into a lift in a bid to escape but Cheshire continued his attack even as the animal 'cowered and whimpered'. Cheshire wore only jogging bottoms and was 'clearly intoxicated', the court heard. The dog was not seriously hurt and will be rehomed by the RSPCA. Chester was given a 12-month community order with the requirement to perform 120 hours unpaid work and pay Â£385 court costs. Magistrates imposed a lifetime ban on him owning an animal - but said he could apply to have it lifted after two years. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard Cheshire took the dog in as a stray a week before the attack. He has been banned from keeping animals for life Sukhdip Randhawa, defending, said Cheshire took the dog in as a stray just a week before the attack. He said his client suffered from anxiety and depression and used alcohol to cope with his problems. During the incident, Chester was on 'a bit of a bender' and could not remember any of it. 'He took that dog in and cared for it and is an animal lover and would like to own a pet again in the future,' Mr Randhawa said.
