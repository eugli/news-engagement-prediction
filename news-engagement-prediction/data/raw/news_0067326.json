Ecstatic, some kissed the ground shouting, “Thank you lord” and “ Viva Espana ”. â¶ VÃ­deo: Subsaharianos dispersos por distintos puntos en busca del CETI - YouTube https://t.co/4u0ZkqZ1u7 — El Faro de Ceuta (@ElFarodeCeuta) February 20, 2017 \nThere are now more than 1,400 migrants waiting to be processed by authorities in Ceuta, which has requested more tents to house the influx of new arrivals. \nWestern Sahara trade dispute \nThe crossings come amid heightened tensions between Morocco and the European Union over a bilateral free trade agreement on agricultural and fishery products. \nUntil late last year, the deal encompassed Western Sahara, a former Spanish colony annexed by Morocco in 1975 known for its abundant offshore fishing. But on December 21, 2016, the European Court of Justice challenged Morocco’s claim to the region, ruling that it was not subject to any EU-Morocco trade agreements. \nAlthough the decision was welcomed by the Western Sahara independence movement, Polisario Front, Morocco’s government reacted angrily, issuing Europe a stark warning over immigration if it failed to respect the original terms of the deal. \n“Any obstacle in the application of this agreement is a direct attack on thousands of jobs… on both sides, and risks the resumption of migratory flows, which Morocco has succeeded in containing through a deliberate, sustained effort,” the agricultural ministry said in a statement. \n‘Morocco will open and close borders as it sees fit’ \nMorocco’s response has been interpreted by some analysts as an attempt to pressure the EU by hitting the bloc where it hurts: the migrant crisis. \n“Morocco’s entire foreign policy is influenced by what’s happening in Western Sahara,” Khadija Mohsen-Finan, a North Africa expert and professor at the Sorbonne University in Paris, told FRANCE 24. “If the EU does not support Morocco’s claim to Western Sahara and turn a blind eye to products coming from this region, then [Morocco] will open and close its borders as it sees fit.” \nEurope has been struggling to deal with an influx of migrants fleeing war and poverty in parts of Africa and the Middle East. Italy and Greece are among two of the countries hardest hit by the crisis, with an estimated 344,793 people arriving on their shores in 2016, according to the UN Refugee Agency. \nWith more and more migrants arriving in Spain each month, there are concerns that the country will soon also be stretched beyond capacity – especially if Morocco halts efforts to control its border with Ceuta. \nThe last mass attempt by migrants to cross into the Spanish enclave was on New Year’s Day, when more than 1,000 people tried to jump the double fence separating the two countries. The incident left five Spanish and 50 Moroccan border guards injured, including one officer who lost an eye. \n(FRANCE 24 with AFP and REUTERS) Date created : 2017-02-22", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:50:47.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
