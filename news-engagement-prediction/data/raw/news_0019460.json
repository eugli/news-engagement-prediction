His victim suffered permanent eye damage (Photo: Gloucestershire Live) Read More \n\"My son will be so relieved, now he can start to move on,\" she told gloucestershirelive.co.uk . \n\"After all this time I just feel completely different already. \n\"Without this no lesson would have been learned. Not by the offender, not by the witness or my son or even the public. \n\"Now we can move on with our lives a little easier. At least there is some form of justice. \n\"You can't do what you did to my son and get away with it. I think my son will be able to move on now.

This was a sustained assault,\" he said. \n\"These factors can only lead in our view to great harm and the use of a shod foot in these circumstances had a devastating effect, suggesting a higher culpability.

The Court of Appeal increased Gaze's sentence (Photo: PA) Read More \nHe can never play contact sports again because of the surgery for fear of severing an optic nerve. \nHe also has problems with his eyesight, has regular headaches, nightmares and needs regular pain medication. \nAfter the trial at Gloucester Crown Court in December, Gaze was found guilty of assaulting causing grievous bodily harm and sentenced to a three-year youth rehabilitation order and 240 hours of community service, while a friend was convicted of assault. \nBut Gloucestershire Police's DC Benn Pockett said after the appeal: \"This is the right response to the level of injury that happened and the nature of the incident. \n\"The family were distraught by the initial decision and they have been driving this ever since. \n\"The CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) got on board and are why we are here so we are very pleased with the result.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T21:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T17:04:22.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
