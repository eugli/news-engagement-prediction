Barbie has had a variety of STEM careers and even ascended to the presidency not long ago.\nBut the paper dolls are free, which opens the possibility of getting them into the hands of many more girls.\nRoszkowski has a spot on her site where visitors can suggest future outfits that she'll draw and add to the collection.\n\"So far, I've gotten submissions for chef, saleswoman and mom,\" she said. \"Those will be coming soon.\"\nHow do you dress like a mom, I wondered.\n\"I was thinking about a doll wearing one of those Baby Bjorns with a baby's head peeking out,\" Roszkowski said. \"But I was talking to some mom co-workers, and they said Baby Bjorns are sort of out.
