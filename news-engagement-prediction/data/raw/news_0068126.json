But the 2014 assembly elections changed that scenario when BJP led by Devendra Fadnavis devised a strategy to poach confidants of Pawars one after another. \nThe saffron outfit first poached Laxman Jagtap, an MLA, and made him the Pimpri-Chinchwad chief. Jagtap, working overtime, ensured that other associates of Ajit switched loyalties. \nMonths before the elections, Fadnavis dealt another jolt to the NCP by getting yet another close aide of Pawar junior, Mahesh Landge, an MLA. Landge and Jagtap then poached Azam Pansare, who was once a loyal face of Sharad Pawar in Pimpri-Chinchwad for decades. \nJagtap, Landge and Pansare, on whom Pawars relied in order to retain their bastion, distributed tickets mostly to imports coming from NCP, which till recently was considered invincible in this belt. These three leaders, however, were modest in claiming credit for the BJP’s resounding victory. \n“The people voted for development, which was our main plant. They saw that Fadnavis is committed to development of this town,” said Landge.

The party expanded its base in suburban areas by opening its doors to aspirants coming from other parties. According to political observers, among the factors that worked in the party’s favour was the foundation of metro rail project which was in the pipeline for more than a decade but did not move forward during NCP regime. \nHaving lost power at the Centre and the state in 2014, the NCP had a make-or-break fight to maintain hold over Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporations, the two civic bodies with a total budget of Rs. 9,200 crore. \nBy losing both, the NCP has lost its last bastion in urban Maharashtra. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:20:38.025+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
