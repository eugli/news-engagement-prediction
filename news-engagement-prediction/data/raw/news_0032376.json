But I will not tell you now if he plays or not.\" \nDeulofeu has made a positive impact since arriving on loan from Everton and he provided a fine assist for Mario Pasalic to score a dramatic late winner at Bologna, despite their numerical disadvantage, a result which ended a four-match losing run in all competitions. \nMontella was asked if the winger could form a front three with Suso and Lucas Ocampos at Stadio Olimpico, but the coach is yet to decide. \n\"A false nine? Yes, I'm thinking about it. It's possible,\" he added. \"It is right to give him praise for what he did [against Bologna]. It's fine to do it in the media but I also like to praise others.\" \nArsenal need more to survive against Bayern \nMontella urged his team to take the momentum from the win over Bologna into the Lazio game, as eighth-place Milan look to force their way back into the reckoning for European qualification. \n\"There were a thousand reasons to make excuses, instead they [the players] were professional. It should be an example and a memory that we use every time,\" he said. \n\"I am very proud, there is a spirit here because we are a true team. The targets are always high, we need this spirit shown in Bologna in order to achieve our aims.\" Related ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T13:42:53.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
