Photo: Getty Images Share Oscars 2017 conspiracy theories Yahoo7 Be - Yahoo7 \nThe entertainment industry is still in shock after La La Land was wrongly announced as the Best Picture winner instead of Moonlight at the 2017 Oscars yesterday. \nAnd now the internet has gone into meltdown trying to work out how the stuff-up happened, and there are some wild theories being thrown around! \nFrom accusing Leonardo DiCaprio of wreaking his revenge, through to pinning the blame on dead rapper Tupac, it seems like everyone has got an explanation for how the wrong card ended up in the hands of award presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway. \nAll hell broke loose when the cast and crew of La La Land were announced as the winners and filled the stage to accept the award - only for one of the two accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers, who oversee the awards ballot, to run onstage and reveal the mistake. La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz announced the mistake to the crowd. Photo: Getty Images \nAnd La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz put his hands straight up, telling the audience \"I'm afraid they read the wrong thing. This is not a joke. Moonlight has won best picture.‚Äù \nPricewaterhouseCoopers has since apologised for the massive onstage blunder, but it's still not clear how the cards got muddled up to begin with. \nHere are some of the best theories on the block... \n1. Leonardo DiCaprio finally got his revenge Leo... Was it you? Photo: Getty Images \nEagle-eyed viewers noticed Leo, who presented Emma with her Best Actress Oscar, didn‚Äôt hand over the winning card to the actress. \nAnd having been snubbed by the Academy before finally winning an Oscar last year for The Revenant , some fans think the 42-year-old could have wanted to get his own back by causing mischief. \nA few Twitter users accused Leo of taking the envelope off stage with him and putting it down on top of the Best Picture card. LEO CARRIED THAT CARD OFFSTAGE PUT IT DOWN WHEN HE SAW WARREN AND WARREN PICKED IT UP üïµüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è #oscars pic.twitter.com/uIOE54oy23 ‚Äî kelly oxford (@kellyoxford) February 27, 2017 \nHowever, Emma later gave a speech claiming she'd had her Best Actress card the entire time. Emma's not lying! Leo gave her the Best Actress envelope and it's in her hand. Photo: Photo: Getty Images \nHowever, PwC‚Äôs Brian Cullinan has revealed that they actually have two of each card at the event. \n\"From a security perspective, we double up everything,\" he told told MarketWatch before the show. \"That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs two of us. We have two briefcases, that are identical, and we have two entire sets of winning envelopes. Martha carries one of those briefcases, I carry the other.‚Äù ‚Äî Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) February 27, 2017 \n2. It was Matt Damon pranking Jimmy Kimmel Maybe it was Matt who got the last laugh. Photo: Getty Images \nThe Oscars 2017 host picked on his longtime friend, Matt, numerous times throughout the evening and some say this was the actor‚Äôs way of getting back at the comedian. \n‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Matt for a long time now, I‚Äôve known Matt so long when I first met Matt, I was the fat one. True,‚Äù Jimmy joked. 95% sure this was a revenge prank by Matt Damon to finally get @jimmykimmel back ‚Äî The Gregory Brothers (@gregorybrothers) February 27, 2017 \n3. It was Jimmy Kimmel pranking The Academy \nThe Jimmy Kimmel Live! host did a pretty good job of entertaining the audience with his jokes and hoaxes. So it‚Äôs no surprise viewers thought this was the presenter‚Äôs way of making this year‚Äôs Oscars extra memorable. classic jimmy kimmel prank ‚Äî brian feldman (@bafeldman) February 27, 2017 \n4. It was a publicity stunt \nOne Twitter user thinks the blunder was no blunder at all, and that it was all a setup to increase ratings! ‚ÄúThe wrong envelope was purposely handed to the presenters to take over the headlines instead of Moonlight's success,‚Äù they wrote. Conspiracy theory: The wrong envelope was purposely handed to the presenters to take over the headlines instead of Moonlight's success. ‚Äî Millennium (@ckgourdet) February 27, 2017 \n5. Tupac is still alive \nAnother user thought this was all too much and concluded this means Tupac is still alive despite being fatally shot 20 years ago, and that Adele‚Äôs Record of the Year Grammy card actually had Beyonc√©'s name on it. Hm, yes, all valid points! I don't care what anyone says they stole moonlight's moment this is a conspiracy tupac is still alive bey's name was on the grammy card too pic.twitter.com/ZwZUHWrCjt ‚Äî Aaron Edwards (@aaronmedwards) February 27, 2017 \n6.
