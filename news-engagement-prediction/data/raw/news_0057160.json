City of St. Petersburg Construction on a new St. Petersburg pier is inching closer. St. Petersburg City Council will consider at a meeting on March 2 a nearly $900,000 agreement with the construction company chosen to oversee the project that would trigger the first steps of building the city’s new downtown pier, according to the council's agenda. An aerial rendering of the pier. City of St. Petersburg The measure includes an amendment to the city’s agreement with Skanska (NASDAQ: SEK) to provide additional pre-construction services, including the purchase of 20 test piles and two overwater pile layout templates. The test piles and templates are needed to verify the length of actual piles used to support the new structure. Not much will be visible once crews begin testing the pilings, as most of the work will be underwater. Boats and barges with heavy machinery will be noticeable to onlookers. City council had already approved $490,000 for pre-construction services including constructibility reviews, cost estimating and value engineering services. The additional pre-construction costs are a part of the pier’s planned budget. However, the project has been under increasing scrutiny, as original features in pier renderings were axed to meet budget constraints. In December , Mayor Rick Kriseman proposed using an additional $14 million from tax incremental funds that were designated for a transportation hub that was canceled. The existing budget for the pier and the adjacent uplands is $66 million. Kriseman’s ask would increase the total budget to $80 million. Additional funding would put some features back into play like extra splash pads in a water feature, a playground, covered shelter and a “gateway” from the uplands to the pier. City staff is planning a presentation sometime this spring on additional projects the extra money would fund. City council would then vote on that proposal. Construction on the pier is expected to begin in May; it's expected to open in late 2018. Janelle Irwin is a reporter for the Tampa Bay Business Journal.
