Journalist Tom Brook, presenter of Talking Movies on BBC World News has been delving into the Academy’s best film back catalogue to find some must see classics, even though the critics didn’t always agree. 1) Gone with the Wind (1939) Despite being described by critics as dramatically inert and taking a white supremacist viewpoint, this is a Hollywood spectacle with many redeeming features, including an iconic performance from Vivien Leigh. The film picked up nine Oscars including the Special Award and saw Hattie McDaniel who played Mammy, become the first African American to be nominated for and win an Oscar when she was acknowledged for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. Photo: Screengrab 2) Casablanca (1942) One of the greatest movie classics of all time which deserves to be revisited because of the screen magic created by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman - and hearing never to be forgotten lines like “Here’s looking at you, kid.”. Casablanca scooped three Oscars including Best Adapted Screenplay – it was based on the (as of then unproduced) play ‘Everybody Comes to Rick’s’. Photo: Screengrab 3) All About Eve (1950) This well-written campy melodrama brings audiences Bette Davis in one of her signature roles. Who can forget her uttering “Fasten your seat belts, it’s going to be a bumpy night.” The film received 14 Academy Award nominations – a record it shares with this year’s favourite La La Land among others. Photo: Screengrab 4) The Sound of Music (1965) Described as “icky-sticky” by one American critic, it remains a must-see for fans of the movie musical and Julie Andrews in arguably one of her best performances ever. Although Andrews missed out on the Best Actress award the film still scooped five Oscars. Photo: Screengrab 5) Midnight Cowboy (1969) This story of an unlikely friendship between two drifters of a different stripe played by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman lingers in the mind - and delivers on many fronts: great acting, writing and directing from Britain’s John Schlesinger. While both Hoffman and Voight received nominations for the Best Actor Oscar they lost out to John Wayne for True Grit in the 1970 ceremony. Photo: Screengrab 6) The French Connection (1971) This classic crime thriller set in 1970s New York is remembered for Gene Hackman’s portrayal of cop Jimmy “Popeye” Doyle but it’s also known for its staging of one of the greatest car chases in film history. The picture gained eight nominations, picking up five awards including Best Actor for Hackman and Best Director for William Friedkin. Photo: Screengrab 7) Annie Hall (1977) This widely acclaimed romantic comedy is seen as vintage Woody Allen - a high water mark in his career. It’s a film in which audiences witness Allen’s character, Alvy Singer, as a close representation of his alter ego - and Diane Keaton in a defining performance. Indeed it won Keaton her only Best Actress Oscar to date while Allen took home Best Director and Best Original Screenplay. Photo: Screengrab 8) Chariots of Fire (1981) This British drama of two athletes competing in the 1924 Olympics brought audiences compelling performances from Ben Cross and Ian Charleson - but what many moviegoers are smitten by is the film’s rousing theme tune from Vangelis. The piece saw the composer and musician take home the Oscar for Best Original Score. Photo: Screengrab 9) 12 Years a Slave (2013) A slave drama which won tremendous acclaim for its director Steve McQueen who also made history by becoming the first ever black producer to win a Best Picture award. Worth watching for British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor in the central role of the kidnapped slave Solomon Northup. Photo: Screengrab 10) Spotlight (2015) A journalism drama involving the Boston Globe’s reporting on sexual abuse in the Catholic Church in Boston. A film that brings rewards because it can be seen as a great tribute to investigative journalism. It received six nominations including both actor and actress in a supporting role, but only won two Oscars: Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.
