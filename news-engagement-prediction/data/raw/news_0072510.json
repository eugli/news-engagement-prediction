We had some really bad puddle dates, and had to turn to poor conditions quite a few times. This is unlike any other year we've ever seen.\"\nLast year the trail was late opening, so Thomson said they began analyzing data to get a better sense of when the trail opens and closes. Usually, skaters are on the ice by late December or early January; the trail most often closes between late February and early March.\nThis year, the trail was already temporarily closed in late January before reopening in early February. The warming huts were removed from the ice last week as a safety precaution.\n\"We want to do our best to make sure we get as much out of winter as we possibly can, and that's why we were so excited to get the trail open this morning. But unfortunately we always have to err on the side of safety,\" Thomson said.\nCanopy still open, Crokicurl to return Crokicurl combines crokinole and curling. (Jaison Empson / CBC)\nThe earliest the trail has ever closed for the season was in 2013, when it shut down on Feb. 27. Typically it lasts through the first week of March. Last year, it wrapped up on March 6 and in 2015 it was March 9.\nThe canopy ice rink is still open, and Thomson hopes it will stay frozen for another week. Crews are also repairing the Crokicurl rink for one last shot at winter.\n\"That being said, it's now time for us to assess and figure out how we move forward next year. Who knows if this mild season is our new reality?\" Thomson said.\nFor the latest canopy rink skating conditions, click here.", "external_links": ["http://www.theforks.com/events/signature-events/skating-trails-park-conditions"], "published": "2017-02-25T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:08:36.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
