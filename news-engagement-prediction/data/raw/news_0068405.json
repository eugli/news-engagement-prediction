Wednesday’s drawing was the first time in nearly three months that the jackpot had climbed above $400 million. \nPowerball says there was one Match Five Power Play winner — a ticket bought in New Jersey now worth $2 million. One ticket in New York also hit the Match Five, winning $1 million. \nThe top prize drops back to $40 million for the next drawing Saturday night. \nPowerball is played in 44 states, plus Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The odds of winning the Powerball jackpot are incredibly small, at one in 292.2 million. \n(© Copyright 2017 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.
