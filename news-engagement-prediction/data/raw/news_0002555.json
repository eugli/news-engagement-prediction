There were demonstrations taking place across America while others around the world petitioned their own governments to take a stance against Trump’s new order. \nIn a mansion in one of Washington’s most expensive areas however, Ivanka Trump slipped into a $5000 molten silver Carolina Herrera ballgown before posing happily with husband Jared Kushner for an Instagram picture as they left to attend the exclusive Alfalfa Club dinner. A photo posted by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Jan 28, 2017 at 9:04pm PST \nO n any other night, it would have seemed like just the latest example of the eldest Trump daughter’s carefully managed strategy to present herself as an aspirational yet accessible face of modern womanhood, juggling her three young children and a high-powered role in the public eye with poise, elegance- and an enviable designer wardrobe. \nAnd yet, there is no doubt that the post came at a monumentally insensitive moment as the fallout of Trump’s order caused thousands to find themselves stranded in airports and millions more without the prospect of escape from danger. Some called it Ivanka’s Marie Antoinette moment while elsewhere it was summed up in a poignant meme showing Ivanka in her crinkled silver dress beside a refugee child in a foil blanket with the caption ‘Who wore it better?’ — Geoff Crawley (@VoiceOfThePhan) January 29, 2017 \nA lthough Ivanka hasn’t deleted the image from either her Instagram or Facebook accounts, a source has now told Vanity Fair that she ‘feels terrible and does not want something like this to happen again.’ \nBut if that is the case, how did it happen in the first place? One theory suggests that because Ivanka and her husband are both practising Orthodox Jews, they had been observing the Sabbath. This would mean that from sundown on Friday until sundown on Saturday, the pair cut themselves off from technology and rest. \nIn fact, it is this religious practice which is being offered as the reason why President Trump has carried out some of his more extreme actions (like sending out press secretary Sean Spicer to say that the crowds at his Inauguration had been record-breaking) on Saturdays when Jared Kushner, Ivanka’s husband and now a close adviser to the President, is not present or in touch. Ivanka Trump also wore Carolina Herrera to the Inaugural ball Credit: Getty \nI f true, it would mean that posting the Carolina Herrera gown shot might have been the first time that Ivanka had logged on for 24 hours. Given the high stakes situation the couple find themselves in though, it does seem baffling that they wouldn’t have someone briefing them on what they’d missed- or the good sense to have a quick scan of the news once Sabbath had ended. A photo posted by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Jan 22, 2017 at 4:52am PST \nG owngate- as it is begging to be dubbed- is Ivanka’s first major brush with controversy since becoming First Daughter. In her previous career at the helm of her own brand, she had coined the mantra ‘Women who work’ and made it her own (she even has a book coming out with that title). During the campaign and since her father’s election, Trump has honed her image as an advocate for women and families, using her own children to create a narrative of happiness and perfection with fashion as a central tool while distancing herself from any of her father’s more extreme proclamations. A photo posted by Ivanka Trump (@ivankatrump) on Jan 23, 2017 at 7:12pm PST \nA photo of her wearing a rich red velvet Oscar de la Renta coat holding the hand of her daughter Arabella in a pristine white princess coat by childrenswear brand Petit Peony as they attended the Inaugural prayer service at the National Cathedral offered a new embodiment of the term ‘Sunday best’ while a family portrait in which her children wear pyjamas and she and her husband are dressed in sleek workwear seemed like a glamorized take on the juggle faced by many working parents. \nThe gown shot may have been intended to be a relatable if elevated nod to the concept of date night but that message has instead become mired in controversy. Given social media has so far been Ivanka Trump’s most powerful mode of communication, it will be interesting to see how her next post might attempt to begin to repair her reputation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T14:07:42.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
