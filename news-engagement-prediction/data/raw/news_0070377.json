So, 'What do I think of Jeremy Corbyn?' is not the question I ask myself. The question is, 'What do I think of the strategy?' \n\"The tempting thing to say is that it's a mistake because it won't get elected but for people like me it's a mistake because it won't address the challenges of the country. \n\"This isn't just an electability question, it's a question of substance. I think one can achieve more radical and substantive change through a different set of positions.\" Labour MPs turn on Jeremy Corbyn after by-election poll disaster \nMr Miliband, who is now based in the United States as the head of aid charity the International Rescue Committee, also revealed he would have joined the 52 Labour MPs who rebelled against Mr Corbyn's three-line whip ordering MPs to back the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill. \nHe said: \"I would have found it very difficult to vote for that because I think that Article 50 needed to be triggered but my fear is that the terms under which it's going to be triggered will be very damaging. \n\"I fear that we are going to end up with a higher chance of a disastrous outcome than is comfortable and I fear that we are going to end up with a harder outcome than is desirable.\" \nHe also refused to rule-out a return to British politics. He told the paper: “I honestly don’t know what I am going to do. It’s hard to see – but what’s the point of saying never?” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T15:29:49.917+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
