The Justice and Education departments will continue to study the legal issues involved, according to the new, superseding guidance that will be sent to public schools across the country. JONATHAN ERNST/RUETERS \nThe move has sparked outrage amongst the LGBTQ community in the US. \nReversing the Obama guidelines stands to inflame passions in the latest conflict in America between believers in traditional values and social progressives, and is likely to prompt more of the street protests that followed Trump's November 8 election. \nREAD MORE: \nA couple hundred people gathered in front of the White House to protest the Republican president's action, waving rainbow flags and chanting: \"No hate, no fear, trans students are welcome here.\" JONATHAN ERNST/REUTERS \nThe decision over transgender guidance is the latest in the string of controversies that have marked the first month of Donald Trump's presidency. \nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said the White House was pressed to act now because of the pending US Supreme Court case, G.G. versus Gloucester County School Board. \nThat case pits a Virginia transgender boy, Gavin Grimm, against officials who want to deny him use of the boys' room at his high school. \nAlthough the Justice Department is not a party in the case, it typically would want to make its views heard. The Trump administration action on Wednesday (local time) also withdrew an Education Department letter in support of Grimm's case. JONATHAN ERNST/RUETERS \nThe protests attracted a couple of hundred people. \nThe federal law in question, known as Title IX, bans sex discrimination in education. But it remains unsettled whether Title IX protections extend to a person's gender identity. Ad Feedback \nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the Obama guidelines \"did not contain sufficient legal analysis or explain how the interpretation was consistent with the language of Title IX.\" \nHe also said Congress, state legislatures and local governments were better-placed to address the issues than the executive branch. \n\"The Department of Justice remains committed to the proper interpretation and enforcement of Title IX and to its protections for all students, including LGBTQ students, from discrimination, bullying, and harassment,\" Sessions said. \nThe courts are likely to have the final say over whether Title IX covers transgender students. The Supreme Court could pass on that question in the Virginia case and allow lower courts to weigh in, or go ahead and decide what the law means. - Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:36:41.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
