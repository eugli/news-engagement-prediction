That level marks a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of its sell-off since the Nov. 8 election. \nWATCH: Mexico president cancels U.S. visit after Trump wall comments \n“Perceiving the 20 percent import tax comment as a starting point for negotiations, the market took some solace because it could have been much higher, say 30 percent or 35 percent,” said Gordian Kemen, global head of emerging market fixed income strategy for Morgan Stanley. \nThe peso has continued its tear even as Trump has reiterated concerns about the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying on Thursday he would like to speed up talks to either renegotiate or replace the deal. \nKemen said investors were relieved Trump did not move to unilaterally withdraw from NAFTA or rule out talks entirely. \nPRICED IN \nAnd though investors have in the past wagered at their peril that Trump’s often extreme rhetoric would not be matched by his real-world actions, many are betting that the current price of Mexico’s peso already reflects the worst of any potential U.S. action against the country. \nDeutsche Bank asset managers said earlier this week they believed the peso had hit a near-term bottom. \nSimilarly, Michael Gomez, PIMCO’s head of emerging markets portfolio management, said that while he expects the background to remain noisy, “Mexican assets and the peso specifically already incorporate much of the expected downside risk.” \nUBS strategists recently said in a research note that even the border tax had been 70 percent priced into the peso’s value. \nThat’s not to say big risks do not remain, especially given the recent bounce. \n“The peso is cheap certainly and absent a big unfavorable change to NAFTA, you will make great money investing in Mexican bonds. But a change to NAFTA that’s unfavorable, and who knows,” said Kieran Curtis, investment director at Standard Life Investments in London, adding that he still sees Mexico as a “deteriorating credit.” \nEach firm calculates a currency’s “fair value” differently, but generally valuations are derived by comparing the ability to buy the same goods in different countries or measuring the value of income and investment an economy takes in against what it spends. \nREAD MORE: Hillary Clinton illness blamed for fall of Mexican peso \nFund managers interviewed by Reuters largely agreed that the peso was at a level inconsistent with the reality of its economy, but some remained wary of further Trump-related surprises. \nWhile he holds slightly overweight positions in Mexican debt, including local currency bonds, Gorky Urquieta, co-head of emerging market debt at Neuberger Berman, said aggressive unilateral U.S. imposition of tariff s or an unwind of NAFTA would likely hit the peso again. \n“As much as we think the currency is undervalued, it could become even more undervalued before it begins a sustained recovery,” he said. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:38:34.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
