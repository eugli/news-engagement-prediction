Editor Advertisement \nSo, today is the day when the budget will be announced by the Finance Minister in Parliament. As per usual like all previous years, Singaporeans will be given some sweeteners for the year. \nThe Finance Minister will definitely name you handouts, that will cover Singpaoreans from all walks of life. But, how long before the sweeteners got turned into other price increases? Already ERP charges going up in several areas. Service and Conservnacy Charges also going up. So, next, our public transport fares also going up? After all, many people are happy with the public transport, right? \nOnly thing you can be sure of is this. Your salary, even if they do go up, will be minimal compared to other costs rising around us. This is Singapore. \nBrandon Tye \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
