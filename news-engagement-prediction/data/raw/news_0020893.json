She told journalist Barbara Walters then that she was a girl.

I insisted that I was a girl, and over the years my parents realized I was a little bit different and decided to love and embrace me for who I am .” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:23:31.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
