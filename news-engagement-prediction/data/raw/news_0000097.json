But year after year, diehard fans can't seem to get enough of McDonald's Shamrock Shake.\nIn the weeks leading up to St. Patrick‚Äôs Day, McDonald‚Äôs brings back its beloved mean, green icy beverage for a limited time.\nBut this year, the frothy drink is back with a few twists.\nBrand Eating reports that participating McDonald‚Äôs restaurants are planning to debut not one, but five different variations of the Shamrock Shake on their McCaf√© menus, including the original Shamrock Shake, a Chocolate Shamrock Shake, a Shamrock Chocolate Chip Frapp√©, a Shamrock Hot Chocolate and a Shamrock Mocha.\nWHAT'S REALLY IN A SHAMROCK SHAKE?\nAs Consumerist notes, McDonald's minty new offerings may have actually been inspired by items frequently ordered off their \"secret menu\" by Shamrock Shake enthusiasts, e.g., a hot chocolate with mint syrup, or a half-chocolate-half-Shamrock Shake.\nSee more info on each new beverage below:\n--The original Shamrock Shake features vanilla soft serve, mint syrup, whipped topping, but this year it may come with a sprinkle of granulated green sugar and a cherry.\n-- The new Chocolate Shamrock Shake consists of half a chocolate shake (on the bottom) and half a Shamrock Shake (ayered on top.\n--The Shamrock Chocolate Chip Frapp√© is a mocha frappe with whipped topping, green sugar and a drizzle of chocolate syrup.\n--The Shamrock Hot Chocolate, like McDonald‚Äôs original hot chocolate, is a blend of milk and chocolate syrup, but with the addition of mint syrup, too.\n--The Shamrock Mocha, another hot beverage, is similar to the Hot Chocolate, but comes up with a shot espresso.\nAccording to Brand Eating, McDonald‚Äôs latest Shamrock beverages are already available in select locations, but Instagram evidence points to a wider roll-out on Feb. 7.\nI can't stand the food, but the #shamrockshake is definitely my all time favorite.
