Chelsea were also the first team Dyche faced when he joined the ranks of Premier League managers last time round, when Diego Costa’s first competitive goal in English football paved the way for a 3-1 away win in 2014 . Right at the start of this season the Clarets shipped another three goals at Stamford Bridge , even though Chelsea were still stuttering under Antonio Conte and yet to hit on the formational switch that transformed their season. \nBurnley have famously picked up only one point away from home all season and after the league leaders at Turf Moor this afternoon they face four consecutive away games. It is conceivable that it could be April before further progress is made in the battle to ensure survival, though Dyche is not unduly worried about the situation. If points were handed out for being relaxed, affable and positive whatever the challenge ahead, the Burnley manager would be even higher up the table than he is already.

If you keep performing at the right level you will win games eventually. \n“That’s what I keep telling my players and I don’t think it is an idle promise. There are no guarantees, we’ve had a number of contentious decisions go against us and things like that are out of our control. But it’s my belief that, if you put in the work and the performances, you will get a reward.” \nBurnley’s remarkable home form is what has been keeping them safely above the relegation scrap a few places below. With nine wins and a draw contributing 28 points to the club’s total of 29, Dyche’s stated aim of turning Turf Moor into a fortress has turned into a reality. He accepts that Chelsea are likely to present the toughest test to date – “they were miles better than us in August and they have morphed into an even stronger unit since” – but refuses to countenance the notion that Burnley have no chance.

We try everything we can to see what works. \n“I must admit I cannot see many weaknesses in this Chelsea side but it’s up to us to find a way to make something happen. We have to believe we can do that because football is full of surprises. No one thought Liverpool had any weaknesses until very recently.” \nDyche’s side were the first to beat Liverpool this season , well before their January wobble, and since then Burnley have been active in the transfer market, bringing in Robbie Brady and Ashley Westwood in quite a busy window.

Part of our growth has been to get to a level where we can compete but of course it is hard to compete with the superpower teams like Chelsea.

Some clubs in this division have owners who say it doesn’t matter what they spend. I don’t know what happened to Financial Fair Play but it didn’t exactly level the playing field. \n“We’ve all seen the heaven and hell of the Premier League when clubs throw money at the problem and end up in pretty bad shape. We can’t do that and nor should we. We work to a fairly simple business model here: don’t bet the ranch.” \nThough not quite at Chelsea’s level – “they are a fantastic side delivering very strong performances” – Dyche feels Burnley have matured into a hardier Premier League proposition this time round. “We are a little more rounded, a little more sure of ourselves, everything seems to have moved a step forward,” he says. “It is fair to say it is tougher against the superpower clubs. There’s a group of them and we all know who they are. They are a step above most of us but we still believe in what we do and that’s important. \n“There haven’t been any gimmes at this club. We have all had to work for everything we have got and what that means is that the players here know the value of what they have got. We are not just going to sit back and say, ‘Oh wow, we are playing against Chelsea.’ This is what we signed up for and we’ll be up for it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:09:10.077+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
