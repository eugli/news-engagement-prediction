The Crystal Method makes some excellent undead-slaying music. I guess I didn’t know. Advertisement \nThe fallen movie director (Paul Reubens) who used dark magic to transport four aspiring young actors (Ike Barinholtz, Seth Green, Jay Pharoah and Sasheer Zamata ) into a zombie-infested space theme park with the launch of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare continues his cinematic assault in the first installment of zombie DLC, released today for PlayStation 4 players as part of the Sabotage DLC pack. This time it’s the ‘90s, and the setting is a forest rave gone wrong—beyond just being a forest rave. \nWhere Zombies in Spaceland gave us wide-open spaces to roam, Rave in the Redwoods is very cramped and corridor-based, so when you get into a wide open area, say the rave camp in the video atop this post, it’s very hard to leave. Throw in the song that was in every cool late ‘90s movie trailer, and it’s just too cosy to leave. \nMy experience with the mode so far consists of trying to play it on own, getting scared and quitting before I was eaten (you start with just a melee weapon and it’s so lonely), and getting into a group in progress and trying my best to keep up. If I stick to the few larger areas, I live. If not, I’m back in the afterlife Arcade, playing mini-games for a chance at being reborn. I miss my old Zombies teammates. Kirk, Stephen, other guy—call me. \nWhat scares me most about Rave in the Redwoods is the Slasher, a terrifying and powerful enemy who only appears when the player activates the blacklit “rave mode”. As cool as everything looks when things go all neon, knowing this thing is waiting for the lights to come on makes activating “rave mode” a good reason to pee a little. Advertisement \nOther reasons to pee a little, Kevin Smith appears in this installment as another actor trapped in the ‘90s slasher film. Left 4 Dead (sorry) but surviving via his excellent climbing and hiding skills, his character helps the players survive.If you play your Easter eggs right, you might even be able to play as him . \nThere are three more DLC packs on the way, so the four aspiring actors aren’t getting home any time soon. Once wave 20 of Rave in the Redwoods is over, the team is transported once more, this time to a vaguely ‘70s-looking subway. If there’s anything that can tear me away from “Busy Child.” it’s some good funk.
