Los Angelenos spend an average of 104 hours in congested traffic a week, according to Inrix, a transportation analytics firm. This number tops Moscow at 91, and in third place, New York City at 89 total congested traffic hours.\nMedia: Brandpoint Seattle comes in 20th in the world, and 10th in the U.S. for peak hours spent in congestion. The average driver spent 55 hours in rush-hour congestion last year, according to the report.\nRelated Stories Survey: How commuters get to downtown Seattle Study: Uber reduces traffic congestion Using new methodology to calculate both direct and indirect costs of congestion to drivers, INRIX found that congested traffic cost U.S. drivers nearly $300 billion last year, or about $1,400 per driver.\nIn Seattle, that cost was about $1,590 per driver, and ran to about $2 billion in total cost to the city's population in time lost to sitting in traffic.\nAnd while that all sounds pretty stunning, it's really nothing compared to cites that top the list, like Moscow, Russia, where commuters spent 91 hours in rush-hour congestion last year. Or even Atlanta, Georgia, where drivers sat for 71 hours -- that's almost three full days -- in traffic.\nWe gathered the top 25 most congested cities in the world straight from INRIX's report in the slideshow above. Click through to see the average hours of congestion and the congestion rate (average percentage of drive time spent in congestion) for each of the cites.\nAnd be grateful that, while traffic here is no walk in the park, it's usually faster than walking.", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/51/67/47/10975696/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/67/45/12286334/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:28:47.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
