(Chris Pizzello/Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  42 PM \nMeryl Streep made a fashion statement at the Oscars despite dress drama with Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld. \nThe 67-year-old actress, who was reportedly slated to wear Chanel to the Academy Awards, showed up in an off-the-shoulder deep blue Elie Saab number. \nLast week, Lagerfeld accused the actress of canceling a dress he was working on for her, claiming that another designer was willing to pay her to wear one of their dresses -- and even called her cheap. \n“A genius actress, but cheapness also, no?” he told Women’s Wear Daily. Oscars 2017: Winners, losers and top show moments \nSince then, Lagerfeld and Chanel apologized in a statement claiming he “misunderstood” the reason Streep chose another designer. \nStreep said the dispute was taking away from her record-breaking 20th Oscar nomination. She fired back on the eve of the award show Saturday. \n“I do not take this lightly, and Mr. Lagerfeld’s generic ‘statement’ of regret for this ‘controversy’ was not an apology. He lied, they printed the lie, and I am still waiting,” she said in a statement to People. Last week, Lagerfeld accused the actress of canceling a dress he was working on for her, claiming that another designer was willing to pay her to wear one of their dresses.
