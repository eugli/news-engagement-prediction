That was due largely to the fantastic blocks of Eric Bailly and Chris Smalling, and when they don't play Mourinho still has Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo to count on. United will need them all in the next 10 days alone when they play in three different competitions, the FA Cup fifth round at Blackburn on Sunday, their Europa last-32 second-leg on Thursday and a Wembley League Cup final against Southampton three days after that. And then back to the Premier League and the intense fight for a top-four position. 'If we progress in competitions, we will be in trouble in April and May,' acknowledges Mourinho, who faces a delicate balancing act that will represent a challenge to even the best multi-tasker. Jesse Lingard came off the bench at half-time as Manchester United delved into their squad Mourinho will spend hours this weekend poring over team selections for one, two, three weeks ahead. Automatic starters like Ibrahimovic, Paul Pogba and Ander Herrera can't start in every game. Those like Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick, Henrik Mkhitaryan, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Luke Shaw who were not in the 18-man squad against the French will have to step up to the plate when called upon, maybe starting on Sunday. Fortunately, Mourinho is a master juggler who twice pulled off multiple trophies at Chelsea, and won the Treble with Porto and Inter Milan. It's in his DNA to take every competition seriously. For all the talk about Mourinho making United more entertaining than they were under Louis van Gaal, he remains a pragmatic manager. Daley Blind kept his place at left back with Luke Shaw not afforded a place in the squad United don't play to win or lose heavily from the opening whistle. They play the percentages based on size and power until they wear the opposition down and take advantage in the latter stages. It worked a treat against an enterprising Saint-Etienne side without United ever hitting dazzling form. The tactical plan was around a central core of five giants; Bailly, Smalling, Pogba, Marouane Fellaini and Ibra. In the first 45 minutes, the French side were clearly ahead on artistic merit though Zlatan's deflected free-kick was the only goal. Zlatan Ibrahimovic celebrates after his fortunate free-kick put United ahead against St Etienne But as the visitors wilted under the physical barrage, United were able to exploit the pace of Anthony Martial and later Marcus Rashford, and Juan Mata's ability to thread a pass. The all-important third goal came via the penalty spot from Ibrahimovic though it looked a soft decision. It was an important goal though because it means the manager may be able to rest a few players for the second leg so they are fresh and raring to go for Wembley. Importantly, the United goal stayed intact. They have lost just one of their last 23 games in all competitions and it's a Mourinho truism that if you don't lose games, you have a chance of landing silverware. Marcus Rashford's introduction was a boost for United, he set up Ibrahimovic's second Chelsea's style under Mourinho was attritiional with Didier Drogba leading the line. It wasn't pretty but the manager could point to the trophy cabinet to justify it. His United are not as different as he would have you believe. With Ibrahimovic leading the line, they aren't going to win by tiki-taka and the high press. But these methods have staying power. 'It's important to keep working hard. This is a decisive moment in the season,' said Ibrahimovic after his hat-trick. He understands this will be a battle of stamina.
