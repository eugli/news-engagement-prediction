His accomplices threatened the guard and the maid with a gun – the staff had been chatting outside the house.\n'Lois lost her bag, her phone and some jewelery. She is a very calm person, she reassured the robber, told him to keep calm.\nMrs Pistorius was accosted in broad daylight as she drove into her automatic garage on Wednesday afternoon. Oscar Pistorius murdered Reeva Steenkamp on February 14 2014. He is currently serving six years in prison\n‘She won’t let this get her down, she is strong. This is how we live in South Africa, there is a full time guard in a guard house just outside the garage and the thugs were brazen.\n'It doesn’t matter where you stay, what security you have, crime is everywhere and any time of day.’\nAccording to a local police source, the Pistorius’s housekeeper and guard were ordered at gunpoint to lie face down on the floor, so they could not put up a struggle.\nMrs Pistorius ‘cooperated fully’ with her attacker after he brandished a heavy hammer in her face and ordered her to take off her rings.\n‘It was obviously a terrifying experience for her, she wasn’t expecting to be confronted by an intruder on her own property - we regard inside the garage as a house robbery,' said the source.\n'She stayed calm and cooperated fully with the robber and immediately removed her rings and handed them over, and apparently was reassuring to him, letting him know that she posed no threat and would do as he wanted.\n'He also pointed to her bag which was sitting on the front seat and she handed that over.\n'The robber did not raise his voice according to the victim, but he was armed and brandished his weapon very obviously, so the threat was clear to her - cooperate or face the consequences.\n‘Later Mrs Pistorius’ phone was found discarded, which is common as the expensive phones have trackers and robbers know they run a risk of being caught if they hang on to them.\n'Mrs Pistorius was offered trauma counselling but said she did not need it. Her guard, who was threatened with being shot, has requested some counselling, however.’\nPistorius moved into a cottage on Mrs Pistorius's large property following the Valentine’s Day murder of Reeva Steenkamp, 29, in 2013.
