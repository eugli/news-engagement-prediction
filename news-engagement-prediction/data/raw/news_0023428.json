He taught speech at Naperville North from 1978-2007 and is a member of the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association and Illinois High School Soccer Coaches Association halls of fame. \n\"When I started I never had a vision of coaching for 50 years, and then when I got to Naperville North, I said I would go 50 years or until I got it right,\" Harris said. \"Fifty years came sooner.\" \nHarris and sophomore coach Nick DiGiovanni, who's also retiring, were honored before Saturday's 30-29 loss to Wheaton North. \n\"It's not a rash decision,\" Harris said. \"I've been thinking about it for several years. I'm getting older and I don't enjoy the bus rides.\" \nBut Harris, 70, still enjoys spouting one-liners. \n\"I should be 71, but I was sick a year,\" he said. \nSuch banter has endeared him to a generation of Redhawks, including senior Erin Moran. \n\"Coach Harris is the nicest man I've ever met,\" Moran said. \"He's always making jokes with me about having my earrings in. He's bribed me with free (ice cream) scoops at Culver's.\" (Matt Le Cren) \nHarris works part time at Culver's and hands out coupons to players for meeting certain goals or following certain rules. \n\"For me, it's to not wear my earrings in practice,\" Moran said. \"He actually made me sign a contract. He keeps it in his pocket.\" \nIndeed, Harris has such deals with all the Redhawks. Sophomore Lucy Schmidt loves it. \n\"(The) Culver's (deal) is a great plus,\" Schmid said. \"For me, it's (making) 10 out of 10 free throws in practice.\" \nBut the players and other coaches value Harris for much more than the treats. \n\"He's always been so great at our practices,\" Schmid said. \"He's so nice and upbeat.\" \nHarris always puts his players first. When he was at Naperville North, he began wearing neckties bearing the names of all the players and hung the neckwear on the wall of his classroom. \nHarris started the girls soccer program at Naperville North in 1982 and guided the Huskies to two state titles, including the first IHSA -sanctioned championship in 1988. \nWhen he retired in 2001, he held the state record for most career victories with 339, which has since been broken by former Downers Grove South coach Barry Jacobson. \nBut Harris also spent 18 years as an assistant girls basketball coach at Naperville North under the late Dale Shymkewich, winning 13 DVC titles. \nWhen Shymkewich retired, Harris was hired by Naperville Central to be Andy Nussbaum's assistant in girls basketball. The Redhawks have since won two state championships. \n\"I thought he was a soccer coach coaching basketball,\" Nussbaum said. \"He was a basketball coach coaching soccer. \n\"It's really been good for me, for our players, for my family in so many ways. One year I'm coaching against this guy and two years later he's in my kitchen. How did that happen?\" \nHarris has cut back his duties this season, but still helps prepare scouting reports on all opponents. \n\"He's got grandchildren, so there are times when he can't be there, but that briefcase is like Mary Poppins,\" Nussbaum said. \"He's got everything in it. He's probably got a taxi cab in there.\" \nAlthough the program is in good hands with Nussbaum and assistant Keith Lakstigala, Harris' departure will leave a void. \n\"He's just a great guy,\" Moran said. \"We're going to miss him.\" \nMatt Le Cren is a freelance writer for the Naperville Sun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T06:04:29.637+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
