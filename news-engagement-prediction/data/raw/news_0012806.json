But another effective solution to the problem of dealing with a critical illness is to buy a critical illness cover. The objective of this insurance is to provide a lump sum to the insured upon diagnosis of a critical illness listed in the cover.\nCritical illness insurance supplements the loss of income due to hospitalization for longer periods.
