Get your 30-day Free Trial\nFlorida State point guard Xavier Rathan-Mayes said Wednesday he's taken on the challenge of guarding an opposing team's best player. USA Today Sports Images Held scoreless in the first half, there was still an extremely real chance N.C. State star Dennis Smith Jr. could eventually catch fire and become a one-man demolition crew.\nNBA scouts know this. Smith is a potential lottery pick. It's why close to 20 NBA scouts boarded a flight from Atlanta to Tallahassee to watch him on Wednesday night.\nThe Tucker Center was far from quiet but wasn't quite at its loudest. A voice, one coming from a Seminole Sound saxophonist, openly asked, \"HE's supposed to be the No. 4 pick?\" It was said in a manner which suggested disappointment until a friendly reminder was given.\n\"Don't piss off No. 4,\" said Seminole Sound director David Plack, referring to Smith's jersey number. \"He could go off for 30 this half.\"\nSmith was never close to 30. He finished with a season-low eight points on 4 of 8 shooting over 35 minutes. Smith was kept in check during arguably his worst performance of the year by the No. 14 Florida State men's basketball team in the Seminoles' 95-71 win.\nFSU (21-4, 9-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) subdued Smith in a way in which only Louisville achieved when the Cardinals held him to eight points on Jan. 29.\nIf it all comes across as a bit surprising, it shouldn't. Much has been said of FSU's success against ranked opponents this season. But there's another impressive yet less discussed facet of what the Seminoles have accomplished.\nBased off the latest mock draft from DraftExpress, the Seminoles have played seven games against eight potential first-round draft picks. FSU is 5-2 in those games and has enjoyed success against those individuals who could become millionaires in a few months' time.\n\"Man, we're big-time athletes. We take challenges,\" Seminoles junior point guard Xavier Rathan-Mayes said with a smile. \"You see somebody on the other side, at your position, you feel like can challenge you, you take a challenge.\"\nHow potential first-rounders have fared against FSU in 2016-17 Name School Position *Ranking Stats Result Dennis Smith\nN.C.
