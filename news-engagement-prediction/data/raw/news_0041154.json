Sarandon, cutting a fiery figure at Manhattan’s Rainbow Room in a bright-red jumpsuit with lipstick to match, told me on Tuesday that she spent about a month of the filming feeling overwhelmed, unsure that she could nail Davis’s particular tone and cadence without going over the top. “There’s nothing wrong with a little camp,” she said. But eight hours of it, Sarandon figured, would be too much. In the five episodes of Feud I’ve seen, the show, created and often written and directed by Ryan Murphy, mostly treads that line well. It certainly provides heaping doses of diva scenery-chewing—from Sarandon and from her co-star Jessica Lange, playing Crawford as a booze-saturated, violently wilted flower. But there’s an actual humanity at work in the series, too. We’re shown a sensitive version of Crawford's and Davis’s inner lives as they war and bicker during and after the making of What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? a legendarily acrimonious process that bore mostly poison fruit. Feud is a sad, loud look at an era when Hollywood’s treatment of women was perhaps less coded, their worth and capital assessed and dismissed in the bluntest and cruelest of ways. (Now it’s perhaps a little more subtle.) Neither Davis nor Crawford were meek, but they were undeniably battered by the system—manipulated into a rivalry that, on Feud, never quite gets to the operatic heights the show may be aiming for, but certainly has a dark, juicy pull. It’s entirely entertaining to spend time in Murphy’s snappy, jewel-hued version of mid-century Hollywood, a time and place where movie stars and their impresarios were still trying to live like East Coast royalty, before they’d forged their own mod, mellower groove, which was on its way by the early 1960s when Feud unfolds, making Bette and Joan seem all the more like dinosaurs raging against obsolescence. As one expects of Jessica Lange in a Ryan Murphy production, she plays a volatile hurricane, an addled tragedy in a musty dress. It’s a variation on many characters we’ve seen Lange play in the Murphyverse and beyond, and it works again in Feud even if Lange’s approach to these characters has, by now, lost its ability to shock or surprise. It’s a familiar riff, just set in an intriguing new world. Bette Davis is rendered in a more minor key. Sarandon makes subtle references to Davis’s Massachusetts Brahmin accent and raspy delivery, but mostly avoids direct imitation. There are times when Sarandon raises an eyebrow and cocks her head and suddenly there’s Bette, owlish and assessing. But there’s mostly a lot of Sarandon. Which isn’t a bad thing—she gives a compelling performance. It’s just that seeing old clips of the real Bette Davis—and, for that matter, Joan Crawford—reminds you just how outsized and one-of-a-kind the real things were. Watching Davis on, say, The Dick Cavett Show , you long to see Davis’s archness and directness reflected in Feud. Sarandon nails it on occasion, but she’s not given enough pepperiness to play with. Murphy and his writers seem more invested in making room for Lange’s theatrics, and focusing on the overall series’s somewhat limply handled social consciousness. Which is all to say that Feud is not quite the rip-snorting bitch fest some may be hoping for. Still, it’s not without bite. The brilliant Judy Davis, playing dogged Hollywood columnist Hedda Hopper, probably comes closest to what some want the series to be. Catherine Zeta-Jones, as Olivia de Havilland, gets some good stuff too. But Feud is otherwise unexpectedly restrained, and I haven’t yet decided if that’s admirable or regrettable. It’s a little of both, perhaps—just as the series flip-flops between serious character study and zesty backstage tell-all. In one episode, studio head Jack Warner ( Stanley Tucci, having fun) says to Baby Jane director Robert Aldrich ( Alfred Molina, having maybe a little less fun), “It’s a B-movie. It’s always been a B-movie.” Watching the scene, I found myself wishing, just a little bit, that Feud would fully embrace its B-ness too. Back at the Rainbow Room, a fittingly dazzling and gilded space on the 65th floor of Rockefeller Center, Lange, Sarandon, Murphy, Zeta-Jones, Kiernan Shipka (who plays Davis’s daughter), and the writer Tim Minear sat down for a Q&A. Moderated by Gayle King, the panel was pretty standard stuff—though nonetheless engaging, given the stars and the subject matter. There was much talk about gender politics in Hollywood. (Other politics were discussed, at length, with Sarandon at our table.) The issue of the pay gap came up, which Sarandon brushed off. “I don’t really care that much about harping on the equal pay,” she said. “It’s such a subjective thing anyway. There are a lot of people that I think are pretty mediocre, and they get paid way more than I do. Men and women. And I’m not gonna let that bother me.” The topic of aging in Hollywood was also inevitably raised, particularly how quality opportunities tend to fade away the older an actress gets. “It is kind of a shattering experience when you realize you’re not wanted,” Lange said. (Later, King asked Shipka if she’d experienced anything like that, and Lange let out a throaty guffaw, exclaiming, “Oh Christ! She’s 17!”) Lange is, thankfully, a beneficiary of a new era, when actors, especially women, are finding gainful—and respectable—employment on television. Zeta-Jones added that she first met Murphy on a trip to Los Angeles, asking her agent to set up a meeting with him because she was interested in joining his repertory company as she nears 50 and feels the ground shifting beneath her career. This frank conversation and its luxe, almost garish setting were apt complements to the series, in which glamour mixes with the various vacuities and indignities of the grinding show business machine. Times have changed at least some since 1961, and there didn’t seem to be any towering, terrifying divas of the Crawford or Davis variety in the Rainbow Room on Tuesday. Though, when I happened to share an elevator with Catherine Zeta-Jones on the way back downstairs, I took a chance and said to her, “You’re in the Ryan Murphy troupe now!” She leaned her perfectly coiffed head back and smiled. “I’m in the troupe!” she said. “It’s exactly what I wanted!” The elevator pinged and she confidently strode out into the lobby, on her way to a waiting black SUV. As I watched her go, heels clacking and dress fitting like a glove, I found myself guiltily thinking that it might be fun to watch her feud with someone next time.
