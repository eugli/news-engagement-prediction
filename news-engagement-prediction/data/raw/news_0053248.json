Article continues below \nAnd, despite scoring his 100th goal on Monday night against Sutton, he still came in for plenty of criticism. \nWith his pace against players from the National League, you’d think Walcott could really show his Premier League class on the 3G pitch. Article continues below What caused an angry reaction from Antoine Greizmann's vs Bayer Leverkusen \nHowever, a 24-second ‘highlights’ video has gone viral on Twitter showing that he didn’t have the greatest game. \nThe clip shows Walcott giving the ball away on numerous occasions and failing to dribble past players that are actually builders and teachers. \nThe video, seemingly created by Twitter user @Joshuapsjones, is titled “Arsenal pay Theo Walcott £110,000 a week…” and has been retweeted almost 1,500 times. Walcott's 'highlights' Twitter reacts \nAnd also check out some of the comments on the video from disgruntled Arsenal fans: \nSome people may point to the fact that Walcott was playing on a different surface than he's used to but surely he should still be able to complete a five-yard pass on 3G. \nArsenal supporters may not be too impressed with Walcott’s performances but he looks on course to set a new personal best in terms of goals this season. \nHe has already notched 15 in 26 appearances this campaign - already his second best tally - with his previous best being the 21 goals he scored during the 2012/13 season. \nBut despite some Arsenal fans criticising his displays, Walcott was absolutely delighted to have reached 100 goals in a red shirt. \nAfter the victory over Sutton, he said: \"It's great. I'm lost for words to be fair because I didn't really think about it before and it's just happened. \n\"It'll probably hit me in a few days I'm sure, but I really enjoyed that. I'm really proud of that personal achievement of mine.\" \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
