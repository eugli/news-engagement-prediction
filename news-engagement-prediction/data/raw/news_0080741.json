I'm withdrawing from the campaign. Congratulations everyone. I request to be left alone. I said what I had to say.. (1/2) — Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) February 28, 2017 One thing is for sure, next time we will think twice before resorting to violence or threats and that's all this was about (2/2) — Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) February 28, 2017 To anyone questioning my courage and bravery.. I've shown more than enough — Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) February 28, 2017 I have been through a lot and this is all my 20 year self could take :) — Gurmehar Kaur (@mehartweets) February 28, 2017 \n7.30am: The march will begin from Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur (SGTB) Khalsa College at 12.30pm and end at the arts faculty building of DU. \nThe protests began after a literary event at Ramjas College was called off as the ABVP objected to an invite to controversial JNU students Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid to speak at the seminar. Khalid was accused of organizing an event at JNU last year in which anti-India slogans were heard. \nUnhappy with the ABVP’s protest, students and teachers called a counter-demonstration last Wednesday and that turned into a street punch-up. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T09:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:20:40.924+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
