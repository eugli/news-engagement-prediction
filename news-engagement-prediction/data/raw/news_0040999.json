Fourteen different players cost the Braves runs, in terms of Fielding Bible’s defensive runs saved , at those four positions, a deficiency the team addressed internally with a healthy Inciarte in the everyday lineup and Swanson’s second-half promotion. \nThe front office’s external moves this offseason offer fewer fielding assurances. If Phillips, who, despite coming off the worst defensive season of his career, owns four Gold Gloves, returns to form he could solidify the infield’s double-play duo until top prospect (and plus defender) Ozzie Albies is ready for primetime. Meanwhile, new catcher Kurt Suzuki’s defense appears to be in decline from his heyday in Oakland, but he threw out runners more consistently than Tyler Flowers and has posted a positive defensive WAR in each of his nine MLB seasons. \nThen there’s the year-over-year comparison: the Braves’ Opening Day lineup projects to replace A.J. Pierzynski, Erick Aybar and Jace Peterson from last year’s version with Flowers, Swanson and Phillips in the span of 12 months. \n— FOX Sports: Braves (@FOXSportsBraves) February 17, 2017 \nUp-the-middle defense earns its reputation through sheer workload. Of the 50,477 defensive plays recorded in baseball last season — excluding catchers and pitchers — shortstop, second base and center field, respectively, did the heavy lifting by the wide margin. Catchers are on the receiving end of every single pitch thrown. Double plays, defensive alignments, pitch framing … the game’s defensive signatures fall disproportionately on the fielders at the center of the action. \nOrganizations, in turn, often place their best gloves there. Over the past decade, seven of the 11 leaders in defensive runs saved and 14 of the top 16 in defensive WAR played up the middle. As Phillips phrased his role, “I want to be the pitcher’s best friend.” \n“If it gives you one extra out per game, think about that. One extra out per game,” veteran starter R.A. Dickey said when asked the difference a formidable up-the-middle defense makes. “In 33 starts, that’s 33 outs. Break that down. Three outs per inning. That’s a whole game worth of outs that these guys are going to maybe give you. That’s a huge deal.” \nDickey should know. The knuckleballer’s Toronto Blue Jays ranked third league-wide in combined defensive runs saved from the four positions last season, anchored by standout center fielder Kevin Pillar: TEAM ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T15:55:41.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
