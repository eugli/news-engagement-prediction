(Kim Janssen) \nThe week has been an emotional roller coaster for those sponsors, who raced to furnish and decorate a local apartment when they learned the sisters narrowly made it. They plan to pay their rent and help the sisters acclimate to the culture and customs of their new homeland — everything from navigating bus routes to writing a resume. \n\"It's very much at the core of our tradition to make sure that we are taking care of the stranger, making sure that we are looking out for the vulnerable of society,\" said Rabbi Paul Cohen of Temple Jeremiah in Northfield. \"Because we know what that's like from very early on, from Egyptian slavery all the way through history. We know what it's like to be oppressed, persecuted and to be exiled.\" \nVic Doucette, a volunteer from St. Francis Xavier Church in Wilmette, also said his Catholic faith prompted him to help folks he's never met from across the globe. He said he's skeptical of the Trump administration's plan to give immigration priority to religious minorities — typically Christians — in those restricted Middle Eastern nations. \n\"We wonder about how that's going to affect other people who aren't Christian,\" he said. \"I would help anybody.\" \nA teddy bear \nAn empty two-bedroom apartment in Skokie has been fully furnished for three weeks, awaiting a Syrian family that was scheduled to arrive Feb. 6. \nA little teddy bear sits atop one of the beds, intended for a 10-year-old boy. \n\"It was cleaned and readied with love and anticipation,\" said Pastor Kevin McLemore of Epiphany United Church of Christ in the North Center neighborhood, which had volunteered to host the refugee family. He said many volunteers were excited to help guide the family in \"all of the frustrations and all of the joys that come with anyone navigating a new place.\" \nThe mother, father and two sons have been awaiting resettlement since 2013. Their arrival, however, has been stalled indefinitely with the executive order.

Forty-year-old Mwege and her son Mukamba, 20, had been living in a refugee camp in Uganda for about five years. They had already been traveling when the new immigration restrictions took hold but were able to arrive just in time, according to officials with their resettlement agency, RefugeeOne. \nMwege will be reunited with her daughter — who had just been released from the hospital after giving birth — and seven grandchildren. They were all resettled as refugees in the United States in 2015 and live in Chicago. \nMwege and Mukamba initially will live in that Skokie apartment once intended for the Syrian refugee family.
