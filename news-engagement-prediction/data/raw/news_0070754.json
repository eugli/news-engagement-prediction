The newly transformed home was unveiled this weekend during the Modernism Week festivities. \nChristopher Kennedy transformed the home's dining room as well as its expansive terrace. The result was indoor-outdoor dining and entertainment areas fit for the nostalgic California jet set. The guest suite designed by Joy Cho (Image credit: Marni Epstein-Mervis ) \nKate Spade New York , Barclay Butera , Joy Cho (you'll spot pieces from her most recent Target collection !), Sarah Sherman Samuel, Gray Malin, Salvador Camarena, and others comprised the list of designers, content creators, photographers, and fashion stylists, who contributed designs for the home. Kelly herself designed her home's family room (or \"glamily room\" as she calls it). Her wildly colorful aesthetic is paired here with whites and muted neutral wood tones for room that is glam and approachable. \nEach room distinctly represents the tastes and aesthetics of its designer. For example, fashion stylist Salvador Camarena's penchant for pop culture and whimsy shines through in his Beyonce-inspired pool bath. Note, the lemon[ade] wallpaper. \nThose familiar with LA-based designer and content creator Sarah Sherman Samuel will recognize some similar colors and elements from her Light Lab project in the guest bedroom she designed at Villa Golightly. (Image credit: Marni Epstein-Mervis ) \nAt the same time, each distinct room contributes to the home's overall aesthetic: Retro-Palm-Springs-Chic-Meets-Contemporary-Hollywood-Regency. Wondering what exactly that looks like? Scroll through our slideshow of the the home for more. \nWhich is your favorite room? Tell us in the comments!
