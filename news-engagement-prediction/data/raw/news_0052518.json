The 41-year-old actress appeared   on Tuesday, where she talked about her split from 53-year-old Brad Pitt while promoting her new film, First They Killed My Father. Jolie clearly got emotional when asked about her family's current situation, after the actress' highly publicized custody battle with Pitt over their six children. \"We are focusing on the health of our family,\" Jolie told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, when asked about their current state while speaking to him remotely from Cambodia. \"So we will be stronger when we come out of this because that's what we're determined to do as a family.\" When asked if she still believes Pitt is a \"wonderful father\" and \"part of the family,\" Jolie didn't hesitate. \"Of course,\" Jolie said. \"We will always be a family. Always.\" The actress also gushed about working with her two older sons, 15-year-old Maddox and 13-year-old Pax, on her new film. The movie's subject matter -- based on human rights activist Loung Ung's 2000 memoir about her experience as a war orphan under the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia -- is definitely personal given that she adopted Maddox from the country in 2002. \"I don't know much of my childâ€™s birth parents but I believe they would have gone through this war,\" Jolie said. \"I wanted to understand him and his culture in a deeper way, and I wanted to bring this story to this country in their language.\" \"So, being with him on set and studying the history of his country with him, and being with his fellow countrymen every day was extraordinary,\" she added. She also revealed Pax did the still photography on the film, though she joked that her sons would actually prefer to have a different career in the spotlight. \"I think they'd rather be musicians,\" she said with a smile.

And we will get through this time and hopefully be a stronger family for it.\" Watch below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:58:14.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
