A police source said it was too soon to conclude that Jong-chol was behind the liquid poison believed to have been used to kill Kim Jong-nam. 'He is being quized on this and he is also being questioned about the whereabouts of three accomplices who are still at large.' One of the suspects, North Korean Hong Song Hac, left Malaysia on the day of the murder Ri Jae Nam arrived in Malaysia on February 1 and left the country on February 13 O Jong Gil was only in Malaysia for a week before escaping on the day of the murder Ri Ji U is also one of the suspects who Malaysian police are looking for following the murder Police fear, however, that three other men - said to be part of a gang of four men working with two women in Kim's murder - might have already escaped from Malaysia. Special branch officers studying CCTV footage from Kuala Lumpur Airport, where Kim was attacked last week, have allegedly pinpointed three men aged between 30 and 50 who boarded a flight to another South East Asian country immediately after the incident. CCTV footage shows that the suspects changed their clothes before heading to the departure hall to board their flight. 'The suspects wore grey, purple and green clothing respectively prior to the attack,' said a police source. 'However, after the attack, they went to a restroom and changed before heading to the departure hall to board their flight.' Police are convinced this was a pre-conceived plan as the two women allegedly involved in the attack - and who have claimed they were tricked into believing they were taking part in a tv prank - have told officers there was no sign of their male accomplices after the event. Police also released a photograph of Vietnamese suspect Doan Thi Huong If the arrested North Korean man, Jong-chol, was part of the assassination team, either directly or indirectly, police believe he would know the names of the three men who remain at large. This would enable Malaysian police to alert authorities in neighbouring countries to watch for them and detain them. On Sunday, the Deputy National Police Chief of Malaysia, Noor Rashid Ibrahim, said four other suspects were on the run. He said the men were North Korean and had flown out of the country last Monday, when Kim died. 'I am not going disclose where they are,' he told a room packed with journalists. Interpol was helping with the investigation, he said. Noor Rashid showed photographs of the four North Korean men police were trying to track down. They were traveling on regular - not diplomatic - passports and are aged 33, 34, 55 and 57. Kim Jong Nam, pictured, died shortly after the hit squad administered the poison on Monday He also said there was a fifth North Korean man whom authorities wanted to question. Kim Jong Nam was waiting for his flight home to Macau when, authorities say, he was set upon by two women. He sought help at a customer service desk and said 'two unidentified women had swabbed or had wiped his face with a liquid and that he felt dizzy,' Noor Rashid said Sunday. Kim died en route to a hospital after suffering a seizure, officials say. Noor Rashid said Sunday that he expected autopsy results to be released within days. 'We have to send a sample to the chemistry department, we have to send a sample for toxicology tests,' he said. Investigators also want to speak to Kim Jong Nam's next of kin to identify the body. He is believed to have two sons and a daughter with two women living in Beijing and Macau. 'We haven't met the next of kin,' Noor Rashid said. 'We are working, we are trying very hard to get the next of kin to come and to assist us in the investigation.' The case has raised tensions between Malaysia and North Korea. Pyongyang officials have demanded custody of Kim's body and strongly objected to an autopsy, saying they will reject any results. The Malaysians went ahead with the autopsy anyway, saying they were simply following procedure. Kang Chol, North Korea's ambassador to Malaysia, said that Malaysia may be 'trying to conceal something' and that the autopsy was carried out 'unilaterally and excluding our attendance.'
