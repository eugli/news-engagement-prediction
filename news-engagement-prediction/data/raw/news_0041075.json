At least that's what one mom says. Eight years ago, Deb Larcombe gave birth to only one of her expected twin babies. While Taylah survived, her identical, brother Jeremy did not. Now, thanks to an unusual family photo, Larcombe believes Jeremy might just be watching over his twin sister Taylah, and the rest of the family, from beyond the grave. Photo credit: Shanelle Massey Photography/Mercury Press More While on a visit to Queensland, Australia, Taylah was featured in a family photo. After closer observation, Larcombe noticed a bright spot shimmering next to the eight-year-old's head. \"After seeing the picture of the glowing face next to Taylah, people have kept telling me that Jeremy wanted to be in the picture,\" Larcombe said to Metro . Photo credit: Shanelle Massey Photography/Mercury Press More The story behind the twins is a rare one. Fourteen weeks into her pregnancy Larcombe was told that Jeremy had Trisonomy 18, a condition in which a child has extra chromosomes. Doctors thought if Jeremy miscarried, Taylah might too, as she was positioned below Jeremy in the womb. He was eventually born with with a section of his brain missing and with serious heart problems - weighing less than three pounds. He died a little over one hour later, and the twins never got a photo together. \"All the pictures from that day seem to have something in them. It is like there is a light moving around Taylah â€“ and I think it could be Jeremy,\" she continued. According to Larcombe, the photographer, Shanelle Massey, didn't notice anything unusual in the photos during the shoot, but thinks the family could be on to something. Larcombe also vowed that Massey did nothing to enhance the photos, and plans to hang this one in her home. \"It would mean a lot to me to think that here is a picture of him and Taylah still together in a way, with him staying by her,\" said Larcombe. \"If he is there, it's as a friend and it's nice to know he is nearby, watching over his sister.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:05:08.734+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
