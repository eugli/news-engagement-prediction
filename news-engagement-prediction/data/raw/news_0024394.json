Is this just fantasy?” It may look like it is what Trump likes to call “fake news”, but for a change, the alternative facts and the real facts are somehow the same: Dr Gurmeet Ram Rahim Shigh Ji Insan (when did he become a doctor?), the leader of the ultra popular cult Dera Sachcha Sauda, has won a film award. According to Bollywood Hungama , the self-proclaimed saint has been awarded with the Bright Award for “best actor” and “most versatile personality of the year”, in an event in Mumbai on February 6. The actor (it’s a questionable description) who shook the world with MSG: The Messenger , and MSG: The Warrior Lion Heart , is back to change the world with a third horrific endeavour - Hind Ka Napak ko Jawab - MSG Lion Heart – 2 , a movie that is supposedly based on the notorious “surgical strikes”. In this latest venture of his, which is all set to release on February 10, the cult leader does more than any man in the history of independent cinema. The man has credited himself for handling no less than 43 departments, including acting, writing, direction, editing, stunts etc. Photo: Bollywood Hungama The man continues to outdo himself, because in his last venture he merely fulfilled the production capacity in 30 departments, which is still a huge feat, obviously impossible for mere mortals. It, therefore, comes as no surprise that the man won the award for the most versatile personality of the year. According to the Bollywood Hungama report, the self-proclaimed superhero has also been presented with Dadasaheb Phalke Film Foundation Award, for most popular actor and director for his second film in 2106. To clear things out, this award is nowhere near to being the same as the actual Dadasaheb Phalke Award named after the man known as the father of Indian cinema. But faux-fancy awards or not, the Bright Awards are very much a real thing, with famous faces like Hrithik Roshan, Ranbir Kapoor, Abhishek Bachchan, Mika, Vinod Kambli, Rakhi Sawant et al present there. In fact, Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis too graced the occasion and also presented the self-proclaimed Insan with an award.
