Trump voters disagree. (Gerald Herbert | Associated Press) Enrique Lavin | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com \nEvery nation has the right to control its borders, to limit immigration, and to deport those who enter illegally. President Trump didn't invent that idea. \nBut it can be done with some trace of humanity. And that's where his new push to ramp up deportations fails so dramatically. \nMillions of good people have crossed our borders illegally to protect their families from poverty or repression. Past presidents, Democratic and Republican, have understood that. \nMost Americans do, too, no doubt because they hear at least an echo of their own family histories. By a 2-1 margin , the public favors a path to citizenship. \nTrump, from the first day of his campaign, has tried to vilify them, to whip up hatred and fear of them, to spread the slander that they are more dangerous than the average person. Never mind that study after study shows the reverse . \nTrump and his supporters argue that he is only enforcing the laws on the books, and that is true. But with 11 million undocumented immigrants here, a reasonable president would focus deportation efforts on the bad actors, starting with those who have committed serious crimes. That's what President Obama did. \nUnder Trump, the \"priority\" cases will widen to include nearly everyone. He says he will bypass the Dreamers, those who came here illegally as children, and that is one consolation. But that leaves more than 10 million vulnerable. \nThe thrust of Trump's plan is to widen the net. A mother who used phony papers to get a job as a janitor is in the target zone. A father caught smoking marijuana in a park 10 years ago is, too. It doesn't matter if they don't have a violent bone in their bodies; they will be ripped away from their children and deported. \nRoughly 1 million more will now be subject to \"expedited\" deportation hearings. That had been confined to those caught near the border within a few weeks of their arrival. It now includes those who have been here up to two years, and it applies everywhere, including New Jersey. The Dreamers will barely have time to say good-bye. \nThe pace of deportations is likely to skyrocket. Trump wants to hire more enforcement agents and judges, and to hasten work on the wall. He wants to enlist local police in the effort, which will drive the undocumented further underground. \nAsk yourself: Will an abused woman call police if she knows her husband will be deported to Mexico? Will a witness to a mugging come forward if it means he might be sent back to Turkey? \nTrump did spare one group: Business owners who employ undocumented immigrants. Nothing in this order stiffens the soft penalties against them, or even attempts to close this enormous loophole in enforcement . \nSo these orders will make life more precarious for the workers. But they do nothing new to interfere with employers and consumers who benefit from the cheap labor. \nReasonable people can differ about the impact of large-scale immigration, legal or not. But these enforcement measures border on cruelty. We are a better country than this. It's a pity that Trump doesn't seem to know that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:36:15.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
