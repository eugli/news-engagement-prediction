Abrams, a seasoned Republican foreign policy official, sent lists of possible candidates for national security jobs. \nOne by one, the answer from the Trump team came back no. The reason was consistent: This one had said disparaging things about Trump during the campaign; that one had signed a letter opposing him. Finally, the White House asked Abrams himself to meet with the president about becoming deputy secretary of state, only to have the same thing happen - vetoed because of past criticism.

Trump remains fixated on the campaign as he applies a loyalty test to some prospective officials. Many Republicans reacted to what happened to Abrams with dismay, leaving them increasingly leery about joining an administration that cannot get past the past. \nAs Trump brings down candidates for national security adviser to meet with him in Florida this weekend, he presides over a government where the upper echelons remain sparsely populated. Six of the 15 statutory Cabinet secretaries are still awaiting Senate confirmation as Democrats nearly uniformly oppose almost all of the president's choices. Even some of the Cabinet secretaries who are in place may feel they are home alone.

Photo: Andrew Darby \nIt is not just the State Department that has no deputy secretary, much less Trump-appointed undersecretaries or assistant secretaries. Neither do the Treasury Department, the Education Department or any of the other Cabinet departments. Only three of the 15 have even named a nominee for deputy secretary. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has a deputy only because he kept the one left over from President Barack Obama's administration. \nThat does not even begin to cover the rest of the more than 4000 appointments that a president typically makes. In some cases, the Trump administration is even going in reverse. A senior political appointee at the housing department, who had started the job, was fired this past week and marched out of the building when someone discovered his previous statements critical of Trump. The State Department laid off six top career officials in recent days, apparently out of questions about their loyalty to Trump. Advertisement \n\"Many tough things were said about him and by him\" before last year's election, Abrams, who served as Ronald Reagan's assistant secretary of state and George W Bush's deputy national security adviser, said in an interview. \"I would have hoped he would have turned toward just hiring the most effective people to help him govern rather than looking back to what we said in that race.\" \nTrump has fallen behind the pace of his last three predecessors in naming senior officials who require Senate confirmation and in securing their confirmations, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. Whereas Obama had nominated 40 senior officials by February 11, 2009, Trump had named 34 of them as of Friday. Obama had 24 confirmed at that point, while Trump has 14. SHARE US President Donald Trump attacked the media and leakers at a combative press conference on Thursday. Photo: Bloomberg Rift between Trump and Washington \nThe trouble assembling an administration reflects the deeper rift between Trump and the Washington establishment of both parties. A reality-show businessman with no government experience, Trump catapulted to power on a promise to break up the system. Even after he won the Republican nomination last year, he did little to win over those who had opposed him, while his \"never Trump\" critics within the party kept up a steady assault on his qualifications and temperament. \nTrump faces other hurdles, too. With no cadre ready to go from past political service, he has been starting from scratch. His team has been slow to vet candidates, and in some cases his choices have had troubles with their business backgrounds or other matters. And Democrats have mounted a wall of resistance to his nominations, slowing the process down. \nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment, but Trump has disputed reports of troubles. Don't believe the main stream (fake news) media.The White House is running VERY WELL. I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2017 \nThe ill will between Trump and much of the Republican establishment works both ways. Many Republicans who might have agreed to work for the president have been turned off by what they consider his sometimes erratic behaviour and the competing power centres inside his White House. After firing his first national security adviser, Michael Flynn , Trump found that his initial choice for a replacement, Robert Harward, a retired vice admiral, would not take the job without assurances that the president was ultimately unwilling to make. \nSeveral other prominent figures coveted by Trump's team for national security adviser, like David Petraeus, the retired general and former CIA director, and Stephen Hadley, former national security adviser, have privately made clear that they would not consider the job. Some Republicans said that any worthy candidate would have to insist on the same conditions that Harward did, namely the right to pick his or her own team. \nContributing to the discomfort among potential officials was Trump's rambling, disjointed news conference on Thursday, which several Republicans said made them worry about what life in the White House or agencies would be like. \n\"The problem is that with each successive episode, it raises the stakes for the next one,\" said Peter D Feaver, a Duke University professor who was a strategic planning adviser to Bush. \"It's going to be hard for the next outsider to accept the national security job and not request the ability to make personnel changes.\" \nOne former senior government official who was considered for a top post in Trump's administration said that many of his colleagues had reached the point where their disagreements with the president's policies and concerns about the unruly workings of his White House outweighed their desire to serve their country. He spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the White House. \nFormer Republican Senator Judd Gregg said the roster of business veterans that Trump had enlisted for his Cabinet was \"the most positive thing about his administration so far.\" But he added that the president's disregard for reasoned advice could complicate his efforts to fill crucial posts. \n\"He really doesn't seem to place a lot of interest in what people tell him who know what they're doing in the area of national security,\" Gregg said in an interview. \"You get the feeling that he's still flying by his own experiences, and that's got to concern anyone who cares about these issues.\" Breakdown of trust \nFor Trump, the challenge is more pronounced because he and his advisers feel they cannot trust some of the senior career professionals still working at the White House or Cabinet departments. Leaks about Flynn and Trump's phone calls with foreign leaders have convinced White House officials that they face an opposition within. \n\"You have a new administration that also has fewer people familiar with the processes and systems of government, including the importance of the vetting process,\" said Max Stier, chief executive of the Centre for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service. \"You can't operate as they did in the campaign context, with a smaller than usual group - it doesn't work.\" \nTrump's failure to vet candidates in advance has led to some stumbles. A White House scheduler was fired this past week because of an issue that surfaced in her background check, something that normally would have been completed weeks ago. \nThe New York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:26:41.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
