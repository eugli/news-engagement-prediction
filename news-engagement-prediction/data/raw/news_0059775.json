Among the local leaders in attendance was Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas and chairman of the House Rules Committee. \nThen on Tuesday, Ryan dropped by Dallas Police Headquarters in route to a trip to the nation's southern border. Thank you Speaker @PRyan for coming by headquarters to visit with our officers. We appreciate the support! #DallasStrong pic.twitter.com/VE9F60ZNjU — David Pughes (@DPDChiefPughes) February 21, 2017 \nHe visited the department to express his support for police and offer condolences for those killed in the line of duty. \nSome of the money raised at Monday's fundraiser could be coming back to Texas. Sessions, who represents Congressional District 32, is expected to have opposition from Democrat in the 2018 elections. The dept would like to thank Speaker of the House @PRyan who came by 2 express his appreciation & condolences to our officers. #DallasStrong pic.twitter.com/sZAqeoOsfj — Dallas Police Dept (@DallasPD) February 21, 2017 View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:31:46.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
