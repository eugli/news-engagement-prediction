He'll likely get more playing time coming off the bench in Los Angeles, but again, it's important to note that the first-round pick is the main draw for Magic and the Lakers in this trade. \nWith a couple more days to go until the trade deadline, it'll be interesting to see what else Magic is able to do to position the Lakers for a brighter future.
