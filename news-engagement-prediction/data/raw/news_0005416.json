Minimalism is the default description used to describe northern brands, though it doesn’t accurately portray a lot of what walks down the runway. It’s true that there’s a certain pragmatism to design here, a general economy of line, and few froufrou embellishments, but there is a new generation of designers who don’t associate themselves with the style, and, having grown up with it, are apt to react against it as they find their own voice. Faced with shifting paradigms in ateliers, which are mirrored in the changing demographics of the country, what’s a Fashion Week to do? Enter Babak Azarmi, director, manager, and cofounder of RMH Sweden (Respect My Hustle), a hip-hop and R&B label representing acts like Silvana Imam, Cherrie, and Jireel, was initially approached by Fashion Week organizers interested in having some of his top talents perform; he declined, proposing instead a space that would give visibility to young creatives. “We wanted to have two days where we could build a vibing scene,” Azarmi said in an interview before the week started. He did that by organizing a trio of events, including an open house for six streetwear labels and an exhibition–cum–poetry slam put together by This Is Sweden, an antiracist platform. He also invited Heron Preston and Virgil Abloh to speak “because of the knowledge they can bring over here.” Azarmi has little doubt that Preston and Abloh will be well received. “Our audience is very young,” he says. “They’re literate and adaptive to change.” They are also partial to brands coming from outside of Sweden, in part because there is a void in the local market. “When an artist comes from the U.S. or France, he gets sold out in a second. [These kids are] actually more connected than anyone in the world: If you count, there are 2.5 computers for every Swede.” Azarmi describes those in question as “third culture” kids, having discovered the term once used to describe the Swedish-born children of ambassadors when Googling one day. “Sweden is a country that’s had immigrants for a lot of years, but on every type of level we are very underrepresented,” Azarmi states. And that’s really the genesis of Space by RMH , a free and “super open” place that celebrates creativity coming up from the streets. “There are folks who are creating the stuff people want to wear, who are growing that type of culture at home in front of their computers, but you get so limited when you do that,” says Azarmi. “With this kind of space we can bring interesting people over here so we can collab for real instead of collabing over Instagram.” Välkommen.
