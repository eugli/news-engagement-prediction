Back then it was a bad wager that Ibaka, who appeared to lack much fire down deep, would suddenly emerge as a go-to guy without Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook around. \nNow with only Terrence Ross and a mid-20’s draft pick to show for those three pieces, the move is unquestionably a disaster. And yes, it's still terrible despite the fact Oladipo and Ilyasova (who they got along with current Knick Brandon Jennings in exchange for Tobias Harris at least year's deadline) were set to be free agents after this season at the time the deal was made. \nMORE: Can Raptors retain Ibaka and Lowry in the offseason? \nLooking at Tuesday’s trade with the Toronto Raptors in the vacuum of present day, it’s not completely awful for the Magic. They were hard pressed to get a great return on a two- or three-month rental for a soft player whose defensive prowess has been plummeting for five years (sharp drops in block percentage and defensive rating each season). However, Ibaka is still a strongly valued commodity in today’s game thanks to his rare combination of long-range shooting and declining-but-still-existent rim protection. You’d think it would be possible for Orlando to pluck a young upside guy riding the bench for a playoff team in return. \nThey didn’t. \nPlease don't try to sell anyone on 25-year-old Terrence Ross being a promising young piece. Ross had a relatively hot start to this year, which has some thinking he's made the leap as a legit, plus contributor. \nHe hasn't. \nThe fifth-year player has regressed to his streaky, barely-average self over the past 20 games, shooting 39.3 percent from the field and 33.3 percent from deep while averaging 9.3 points per contest. His player efficiency rating has reached a career-high 14.9, but he’s still yet to break 15 in a season (the benchmark of an average player). \nRoss’ status was elevated early on in his career thanks to a dunk contest victory as a rookie and a 50-point explosion in his second season, but he’s never expanded his game. His career highs in minutes played, points, rebounds, assists and 3-point percentage all came in that second year. He's been prone to rough mental collapses (see the end of Game 4 of the 2016 Eastern Conference Semis), and the Raptors have netted out worse with Ross on the court each season prior to this one. \nAt best, Ross is an occasionally serviceable bench player for a good team, but one who has bad efficiency written all over him with an increase in touches. Even Norman Powell would have been a better haul from Toronto. \nBut how about that precious first-round draft pick? The pick will almost definitely be coming via the Clippers, which would currently position it as 25th overall in the 2017 Draft. Let’s take a look at how the No. 25 pick turned out over the past eight years, in chronological order: \n2009: Rodrigue Beaubois (out of the league after four years) \n2010: Dominique Jones (out of the league after 80 games) \n2011: MarShon Brooks (out of the league after three years) \n2012: Tony Wroten (out of the league after four years) \n2013: Reggie Bullock (2.9 career points per game) \n2014: Clint Capela (really solid player) \n2015: Jarell Martin (67 games played in two years) \n2016: Brice Johnson (hasn’t played a game) \nOne out of eight isn’t the best. \nThis was not a good trade by the Magic. And this was a really poor evaluation of personnel by the Magic dating to last June.
