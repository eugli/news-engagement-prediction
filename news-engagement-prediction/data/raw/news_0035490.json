That office ceased to be a Cabinet-level position in 2009. \nDonahue said that for security reasons, she could not provide any information about the number of marshals assigned to DeVos, nor whether they are providing round-the-clock protection. It is unclear how long the arrangement will last.

(Maria Danilova / AP) \nEducation Department officials did not respond to repeated requests for information about why they have called on the marshals or what the security team normally assigned to cover the secretary is doing now. \nFederal policy allows the Education Department to pay other agencies for services, but it is unclear whether the department is reimbursing the marshals for the cost of deploying a security team. \nMarshals began providing security for DeVos on Monday, Feb. 13, the first weekday after DeVos encountered protesters outside the District's Jefferson Middle School Academy, Donahue said. \nThe demonstration was mostly peaceful, but several protesters attempted to block a government car from entering the street in front of the school, and a few others tried to bar DeVos from entering the building. Video circulated by WJLA, the local ABC television affiliate, showed a member of the department's security team steering DeVos away from the protesters, guiding her by the arm as she returned to her government vehicle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T05:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:08:50.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
