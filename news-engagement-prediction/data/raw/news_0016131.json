The film has one more romantic number which was chopped out due to its length. Sung by Shreya Ghoshal and Sonu Nigam, the name of the song is Halka Halka and it’s a rain sequence. Interesting no? Well, this clearly confirms reports that a lot of chopping has been done for Raees before it was presented to the audience. Although the film already has a romantic number, that is, Zaalima, sung by Arijit Singh and even Udi Udi Jaye by Sukhwinder Singh. But there’s one more track featuring Mahira and Shah Rukh that didn’t make it to the big screen. At a success press conference held today, the actor announced that the song will be released in 2 days. He gave details of the same that its sung by two spectacular artistes and that it’s a rain sequence. Exciting, isn’t it? This surely is a post Raees treat to fans, who have still not gotten over SRK’s surma look. \nBut while we’re excited for the song, this takes us back in time when it was revealed that a few scenes of Mahira as well as a romantic track was deleted from the movie to avoid controversy. Remember, Mumbai Mirror had reported that a lot of songs including a romantic song was cut from Raees because they wanted to minimalize controversy. We had also taken it up and although we were surprised to see Zaalima, this revelation surely proves that more than what’s been shown of Mahira Khan in the movie, has been deleted. ( ALSO READ – Mahira Khan’s scenes CUT SHORT in Shah Rukh Khan’s Raees – read details ) \nOur reporter told us that at the press conference of the film, after the actor made the announcement, people asked the reason behind the omission. To this, Shah Rukh kept blaming producer Ritesh Sidhwani for making the decision to edit out this song. However, Sidhwani soon retorted, “Yeah right, you are sitting here and I’ll call the shots. Look, everyone is laughing.” Guess with the whole fire around the Pakistani artistes dying down, the makers think it’s safe to release the song. Anyway, we’re super curious to know what Shah Rukh and Mahira have in store for us in Halka Halka. \nStay tuned to this space for hot scoop and latest updates. \nPublished: February 3, 2017 11:15 pm Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T19:56:08.440+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
