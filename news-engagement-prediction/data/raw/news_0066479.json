Smith struck his fifth Test century against India and 18th overall as Australia were all out for 285 at lunch, thereby setting India 441 to win on Day 3. \n\nIt seemed that Smith was destined to reach three figures. He was handed yet another life, fourth in the innings, when an edge went past Ajinkya Rahane at leg slip. Add to this the numerous occasions the ball missed his outside edge against the spinners and a plumb lbw appeal that was turned down. \n\nLuck was definitely on his side but that shouldn't take away how he applied himself on an abrasive surface where batting is becoming difficult with every ball. He judged the length well and was calm despite having to fight the vicious turn every next ball which got the better of quite often. A late cut off Ravindra Jadeja took him to 98 and a couple to his maiden century on Indian soil. The pumped up celebration that followed made it clear how much it meant to him. \n\nThat he was able to reach three figures was also because of the support he received from the other end. His overnight partner Mitchell Marsh fell early (31) but not before a 56-run stand for the fifth wicket. Then came Matthew Wade, with whom Smith added a further 35. While India must be ruing their luck, they must have learnt the importance of judiciously using their reviews when Wade clearly edged one to the 'keeper but stayed put and India couldn't challenge the not out decision having exhausted both their reviews on Day 2 itself. That didn't cost them much as two balls later, he again was caught behind and this time, he walked for 20. \n\nMitchell Starc continued having fun with a four and a six over midwicket off Jadeja. With Smith, he added 42 runs for the seventh wicket at 4.75 rpo. The association was broken when Jadeja finally had Smith lbw for 109 but by that time, he had taken the lead past 400 runs. The tail further frustrated India with Starc hitting Ashwin for two more sixes before they were all out. India have eight sessions to chase down the target. \n\nBrief Scores: Australia 260 and 285 (Smith 109; Ashwin 4/119) set India 441 to win", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T18:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:47:26.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
