Photo: Farmer David Matthews and his wife, local accountant Sam Matthews, were instrumental in setting up the first community bank almost 20 years ago. (ABC Central Victoria: Larissa Romensky) \nDavid Matthews, a third generation farmer, chairman of the first Australian community bank, in Rupanyup, and previous owner of the Wimmera Grain Company with his wife, said the role of the community bank was no longer about helping towns to improve local facilities, but to start looking at the economic activity of the towns. \nTowns like Nhill in western Victoria have attracted a large Karen population, largely due the local duck processing plant, while Pyramid Hill in central Victoria has attracted many Filipinos because of the piggeries. \nMr Matthews said there did not have to be a strong base industry to attract a population. \nTourism and the industry of agriculture, which has seen a shift from individual smaller family farms to large scale farming, have important roles to play. \n\"We have to get smarter about aggregating our demand and create the opportunity to attract someone,\" Mr Matthews said. \n\"We all need a mechanic on our farm but we can't justify having a mechanic each, but can three of us get together and employ a mechanic?\" Colombian vets enjoy new home Photo: Guillermo Sierra Cespedes and his wife Magda Liliana Medina with their three children. (ABC Central Victoria: Larissa Romensky) \nQualified vets in Colombia Magda Liliana Medina and her husband Guillermo Sierra Cespedes arrived in Australia five years ago in search of better work opportunities and a \"better future\" in Australia. \nThey worked in a range of jobs from cleaning to hospitality before finding work in the agricultural sector. \nWhen they arrived in Rupanyup, Ms Medina worked for a year in a nearby piggery, and Mr Cespedes now works as a farm manager on the Matthews' farm, after meeting the local farmer while studying agriculture. \nDespite the first \"challenging\" year, especially for Ms Medina at home with a young child, no friends or internet, she now prefers the quiet rural town and has made many friends. \nTheir son Philp, who used to travel a four-hour return bus trip to school in Colombia, now walks a short distance to school and has joined the local football team. \n\"The good thing about this is when you arrive at the crowd you find all these people gathering together,\" Mr Cespedes said. Community supermarket in the pipeline Photo: Malcolm Uhe, president of the community enterprise group, at the site of the proposed new supermarket. (ABC Central Victoria: Larissa Romensky) \nMalcolm Uhe returned to Rupanyup four years ago after retiring and now heads up the local community enterprise group hoping to reinvigorate the retail centre in town. \n\"You have to do something. You can't just let [the town] dwindle and die over time,\" he said. \nThe main focus is building a community supermarket, which wasn't viable as a commercial venture, along with some other speciality shops including a cafe at the old general store site. \n\"The community will own the building, the community will fit out the shop, the community will benefit from the profit generated,\" Mr Uhe said. \n\"If we're having to go to other places just to conduct business, it very quickly is the death knell for a small town.\" \nWith $1.2 million needed for the venture, the group is waiting to hear back about its final funding application with the State Government. Tourism in the Wimmera plains Photo: The silo art trail is heading to Rupanyup and the hope is it will bring much needed tourism to the town. (ABC Central Victoria: Larissa Romensky) \nMr Matthews admits 10 years ago he saw tourism in the Wimmera plains as a \"bit of an oxymoron\", but with the planned silo art in March he admits he was \"dead wrong\". \nHaving seen the impact of silo art on towns like Brim and Patchewollock, and the flood of Chinese tourists in the town of Sea Lake , he understands the attraction of the big sky and clean air. \n\"I've certainly moved my view to think that tourism could become a very important part of the economy here,\" Mr Matthews said. \n\"There's a big but and that is that we have to prepare for it, because I think we're under prepared as regional communities.\" \nHe said people were turning up to look at the silos with nowhere for them to spend their money. \n\"We need to make sure our people within our community have a retail offering ready for the people that come to look at the silos to enjoy,\" Mr Matthews said. The entrepreneur Photo: Claire Morgan has opened a gift shop in the middle of town. (ABC Central Victoria: Larissa Romensky) \nHaving been born to a farming family, Claire Morgan and her husband have \"farming in the blood\" and bought a farm in the area six years ago. \nNot content with just the family business, the keen entrepreneur opened a gift shop in the centre of town that also serves coffee, along with a chocolate brownie mix made from the region's chickpea flour. \n\"I just believed there was an opportunity to open up a business like this for the women in our town and people passing through,\" Ms Morgan said. \nShe said word of mouth had been spreading, and people from further afield had been travelling to the shop. Renovations underway at museum Photo: Michael Woods, one half of the bachelor farmer brothers at the Woods' Heritage and Farming Museum. (ABC Central Victoria: Larissa Romensky) \nMichael Woods runs the local Woods' Heritage and Farming Museum, a huge 60m by 30m metre shed that houses all sort of collectables from tractors to sewing machines and a street of mock shops such as a general store, post office and butcher. \nThe shed was built more than 10 years ago by Mr Woods and his late brother John as a place to house their collectables and for the public to enjoy. \n\"Neither of us had family to leave it to. We're Rupanyup people, we're fifth generation, so we thought we'll leave it to Rupanyup,\" he said. \nThe retired farmer said he was busier now than he had been when he was working, being in the middle of renovations in preparation for the influx of tourists expected to visit the silo art.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:34:15.597+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
