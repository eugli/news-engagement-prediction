If one wants a bouquet, we can adjust the price to around Rs100-120 for each rose,” said Kunjlal Nalavade, a florist at a flower market in Mumbai. \nFlorists say the Valentine’s week is a boom period for them and that the sales have kept increasing over the years. “All thanks to youngsters, our business during the second week of February reaches new heights,” said Surekha Khairwar, another florist at Dadar market. \nAlthough other gifts have not remained as popular, roses have retained the favourite tag. The demand for greeting cards has dropped significantly over the years. “Cards have become cliché now. There are so many other things available which one can gift their partner that can be of use too. Cards are just to keep in the cupboard as a memory,” said Shweta Sonigara, 22, a psychology student and a Malad resident. \nREADMORE ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:00:24.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
