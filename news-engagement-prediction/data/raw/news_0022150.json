Sajjan would not say if Defense Secretary James Mattis had made any assurances that the U.S. would not employ torture under Trump, an avowed torture supporter. But Sajjan, a former military officer who served in Afghanistan, said they did discuss “ethics in soldiering” when they spoke at the Pentagon outside Washington on Monday.\nRead the latest news on U.S. President Donald Trump \n“When it comes to our military and Canadian values, we follow international law and Canadian law. Canada will never use torture or be party to that,” Sajjan said in an interview on Tuesday. “This is something that not just within our military but many militaries ‎also understand. I’ve worked with the U.S. military, and they too have the same structure and values as us.”\nHe added: “It goes without saying that we will never be a party to it. If we are a witness to it, we have a responsibility to report it, to investigate it.”\n  Trump has spoken approvingly of torture , and he vowed on the campaign trail to bring back not only the torture tactic of waterboarding but “a hell of a lot worse.” Since his election, he has said he would defer to Mattis’s anti-torture views.\nSajjan would not say precisely what his commitment to never be a “party” to torture might mean in practice. Michael Doucet, head of the watchdog body overseeing Canada’s intelligence service, was recorded saying a month after Trump’s election that Canada may be forced to reconsider how it shares intelligence with the U.S.\nSukanya Pillay, executive director and general counsel of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, praised Sajjan’s words but urged the government to “put action behind them” by rescinding a formal policy, issued under the previous Conservative government, that allows Canada to use information obtained through torture in “exceptional circumstances” involving an “immediate” threat. \n“I think the minister’s comments are important. And I think Canada has to now take care that we do not condone or inadvertently collude with torture. And one safeguard would be to immediately rescind the ministerial directive,” she said.\nCanada has a checkered recent history on torture. A federal inquiry concluded that Canadian Maher Arar was tortured in Syria after the RCMP passed bad information to American authorities under George W. Bush. Hundreds of prisoners turned over by Canadian soldiers to the Afghan army were allegedly tortured; Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberals demanded an inquiry while in opposition but have refused to launch one in office. \nAs recently as Monday, Trump has been castigating members of the NATO military alliance for failing to meet a guideline of spending 2 per cent of their gross domestic product on defence. Sajjan would not say if Mattis pressed him to boost Canadian spending above the current 1 per cent of GDP.\nSajjan, though, made a kind of counter-argument. What matters, he said, is not just how much money a country spends but what it is accomplishing. \n“There are many things that Secretary Mattis knows quite well that Canada does that other nations cannot do and have not,” he said. \nTrudeau and his ministers have made a painstaking effort to avoid criticizing Trump. Asked whether Trump’s stated desire to “take the oil” from Iraq might give Canada any pause about participating in a coalition with the U.S., Sajjan said he does not pay attention to every utterance in the foreign media. \nAnd asked whether he worries about Trump handling an international crisis, Sajjan responded: “President Trump has been democratically elected by the U.S. people.”\n“We will always work together with our closest ally in dealing with challenges,” he said. “We’ve done it in the past, and we will continue to do it now.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:54:34.851+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
