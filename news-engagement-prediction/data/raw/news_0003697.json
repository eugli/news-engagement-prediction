Homeless Persons Union Victoria says none of the residents have been found transitional housing, as promised. Picture: Nicole Garmston Source: News Corp Australia \n“People there tonight said no one has been there since the announcement on Friday and offered them the transitional housing the government said would be immediately provided. \n“Members of the HPUV and others will be there to bear witness to this removal ... Please join us if you can and capture this.” \nThe issue arose during the Australian Open, when thousands of visitors from interstate and overseas descended upon Melbourne. \nFlinders Street Station is the main public transport arrival point for those travelling to the international tennis event at Rod Laver Arena.

You can’t walk 250 metres without being hassled for money. \n“It’s not a good look for Melbourne. \n“It doesn’t look like the world’s most liveable city from what I’ve seen so far.” \nBut, in response, an open letter from the CEOs of 36 agencies working with rough sleepers urged the media not to vilify them. \n“Vilifying people sleeping rough does not help them, splashing the faces of people in crisis in the paper only further stigmatises and isolates them, and fuels public fear and resentment,” the letter said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:15:50.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
