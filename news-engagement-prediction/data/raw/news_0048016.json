New Department of Education figures to be released Wednesday show there were 554,179 full-fee paying international students in Australia in 2016, generating a total 712,884 enrolments. Enrolments grew by 11 per cent on the previous year while the number of international students beginning their studies rose by 10 per cent. New enrolments grew by 12 per cent in Victoria and 10 per cent in NSW. International education is Australia's third largest export after iron ore and coal and has flow-on effects for the retail, hospitality and tourism industries. Universities are also increasingly dependent on international student revenue to pump money into teaching and research. The University of Melbourne raked in $526 million in international fee revenue in 2015, up 21 per cent on the year before. The proportion of revenue from international students, rather than local students, increased from 41 per cent in 2011 to 48 per cent in 2015. The University of Sydney recorded $480 million in international fee revenue in 2015, up 23 per cent on the previous year. Education Minister Simon Birmingham said it was a \"gangbuster\" year for international education and that the government will leave \"no stone unturned\" to maximise opportunities for more growth. \"In addition to the quality of our international education offering, various geopolitical factors create new possibilities for Australia to maximise our share of the growing number students from all over the world who are travelling to study,\" he said. The chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia, Phil Honeywood, said Australia was in a strong position to benefit from political ructions in competitor countries. \"Because of Brexit, European students will no longer be able to study for free in the UK,\" Mr Honeywood said. \"And there are perceptions the US will not be a welcoming place for students from many countries under President Trump. \"That reinforces Australia as a safe, affordable and attractive destination.\" But Mr Honeywood said Australia should not grow complacent because countries such as Canada and New Zealand were making strong pitches to international students. Australia needs to focus on providing more affordable student accommodation, better integrating local and foreign students and providing more work experience opportunities during study, he said. Malaysian student Fatim Amran, 24, said she would not be keen to study in the US because of \"political conditions\". Ms Amran and fellow student Naomi Zhao from China said they had closely examined international rankings tables before opting to study international management at Canberra's Australian National University. They said they liked Australia's climate and welcoming environment, but that accommodation was expensive. Almost a third of all international students came from China in 2016, with Chinese enrolments growing by 16 per cent over the past year. Enrolments from Brazil surged by 20 per cent and by 22 per cent from Columbia. Higher education enrolments grew by 13 per cent and vocational education enrolments by 12 per cent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:21:23.382+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
