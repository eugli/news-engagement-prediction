Not bad for someone born in 1917. One of the few advantages in choosing authorship as a profession is the faint possibility of a long career, but not everyone manages to keep words and passion alive for the duration. Burgess’s practical attitude to his writing, his detailed understanding of voices, the changing sounds of humanity and the musics and mass cultures they produce all helped to keep his voice on the page young and, in every sense, vital. His outrage in the face of media-sponsored human folly also helped to keep him burning bright. Burgess always both gave and received in his relationship with popular culture. \nAnd that first sentence is typically craftsmanlike. Burgess loved the precison, power and adventure inherent in his huge vocabulary. He was a grammar school boy, an eternal autodidact and a trained teacher – he’s going to give you words. So there’s that latinate and louche term for a gay lover – still daring in 1980. He drops in the exoticism of the name Ali, the incongruous arrival of a senior Catholic cleric – and the immediate taste of a real, unique human being’s voice. It’s a tease, a deft setting out of the novel’s key elements and a display of bravado, partly by the author and partly by his fictional narrator Kenneth Toomey, who – further down the page – will admit he was aiming to impress. Both Toomey and Burgess are showmen with an interest in “high” art, “low” entertainments and everything in between. Burgess once wrote: “There is no worse neurosis than that which derives from a consciousness of guilt and an inability to reform” – and Toomey is created to embody that throughout his suitably serpentine memoir. \nBurgess gives us here one of his many morality tales, as told by an immoral old man: lapsed Catholic, hack writer, an innocently homosexual, guilty sensualist who looks back over a star-studded, sordid, compromised life, during the star-studded, sordid, compromised 20th century. It’s a kind of joke Burgess tells against himself – holding a funhouse mirror up to personal and professional falls from grace and adding a few he avoided. And he reveals the energy and empathy not just of an author, but an entertainer – a man who liked the immediate applause his music could gather when performed, who took pains to give a rattling good reading for an audience, even when he’d just learned he was dying of cancer. Toomey, the author of feelgood musicals and second-rate prose, tells a grim tale peppered with the dark wit of an 80s new wave comedian. He says of a Nazi soldier, “He had a compassionate face: he would be compassionate while supervising human liquidation: this liquidates me more than it does you.” \nBurgess, born John Burgess Wilson, was the son of performers. His mother, who died when he was very young, was a dancer and his distant father played the piano, mainly in pubs, but had, one music hall evening, accompanied the Eight Lancashire Lads – including Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin. (Chaplin is the underdog ghost with the pre-Hitler moustache who haunts Earthly Powers .) Burgess was a writer with his earliest roots and inspirations deep in popular culture, a lonely child who read out silent movie speech cards to illiterate neighbour kids in the cinema, a warily intelligent adult who addressed popular forms as an observer, a creator and one of the UK’s earliest authors to embrace the possibilities of television. Publicity? A chance to educate and entertain, to challenge and tease all those thousands of people in thousands of living rooms? Of course he embraced TV, as other more staid and less working class authors did not. And through popular culture, as a writer and composer, the unloved child and initially under-loved man could allow himself the benefit of mass appreciation, affection without commitment.

He’d sit, the Lancashire lad made good, talking in soft, fastidious Manchester tones, answering serious but deferential questions as a wise old polysyllabic author. He’d give good value, happily admit he could do nothing else but write while also discussing his musical composition, even sometimes playing the piano. I remember his swept-aside comb-over with that comical little kick above one ear, and the deadpan face and delivery of a northern patter man. It was the face of someone who wouldn’t mind performing on the page using the hypnotising, futuristic voice of Alex, the Beethoven-loving thug of A Clockwork Orange , or the subtly subversive narration of Janet Shirley, a northern housewife whose comment on killing her quiz show-winning but insane husband is: “The best first thing to do, when you’ve got a dead body and it’s your husband’s on the kitchen floor and you don’t know what to do about it, is to make yourself a good strong cup of tea.” The novel she inhabits is the perfectly titled One Hand Clapping, which castigates the banality and corruption of newspapers and televison shows – their inability to be anywhere near as profound as a Buddhist conundrum, not supplying the possible sound of one hand clapping, offering only a bizarre wag of self-congratulation, or else a wave goodbye. Burgess, like a good teacher, had high aspirations for both print and visual media. He also relied on them in their imperfection, both as a subject and an author, but he perhaps salved his conscience by lambasting their faults, or perhaps he hoped for their reform, their education. \nBurgess grew up as Jackie Wilson. As Anthony he appears under both a saint’s name and a kind of stage name and is forever playing parts, slipping his people deep into our heads, making us play roles and letting us see the sin and the sinner, ourselves in the other and the other in ourselves. And Burgess, even as late as the 1990s, was still able to use the idea of media confession as an opportunity for moral inventory. He defied publicised, salacious gloating with an unsensational laying out of stark truths in autobiographies and interviews. Burgess shows Toomey – and indeed Janet’s quiz star husband – demeaning himself for attention and money, and knowing it. But Burgess approached the media as someone whose early life had taught him to be untrusting and to at least acknowledge morality’s practical uses. His was honesty as self defence – inside and out – while his ongoing critiques of popular culture were far-sighted and damning. Which didn’t stop him using it to sell books. \nHe’d been poor and didn’t like it. His aim was to earn a living and he chose – rather late – to do that by writing. He mentioned aiming for, “2,000 words before breakfast and then you have the rest of the day”. That is a good many words, in case you were wondering. Before breakfast. At one point he had to write under another assumed name, Joseph Kell, to prevent himself from seeming disreputably productive. He brought the work rate of a good tradesman to what was still regarded as a gentlemanly game, something creative chaps did to pass the time, not work, not commerce, not setting out your stall in the public eye. \nThe Burgess onscreen in my living room was selling himself on his own terms. He would talk about the details of literature, the work. He could discuss culture without flattering the worst of its tastes – the wilful ignorance, the parasitic intrusion, the distortions. His forensic eye owed its insights not to a university, but to early Catholic instruction in self-examination and to Manchester’s streets, the twists of working class wit in the pubs and booze shops his family ran and frequented. Burgess never lost his early affection for the wordplay that makes a joke, a song, a rhyme, out of current events and personalities, human failings. He could tell the difference between a lack of education and wilful ignorance and – like the teacher he briefly became and the wary child he always stayed – he could point out that being misinformed, or uninformed, put one at a personal and political disadvantage. Lord knows what he’d think of us now. The emptiness of a demagogue’s words or the greedy jangle of advertising catchphrases revolted him, and he said so \nUnconventionally educated and inveterately curious, Burgess was a polyglot magpie amongst the world’s inspirations. He was an elitist in the sense that he liked – as every craftsman does – a proper job, well done. He’d never forget a street rhyme of quality, or a fine aria, sonnet, a foreign term, a good movie or nickname. And this wasn’t the fake equivalency that allows the half-finished and ill-conceived to be celebrated just for existing or being fashionable. Burgess knew the kind of bad faith and bodging that leaves the artist dependent on fawning and gimmicks to survive. But if there was beauty and truth in something, it was good. The emptiness of a demagogue’s words, of religion’s circumlocutions, or the greedy jangle of advertising catchphrases revolted him, and he said so. \nAnd part of his later use of essays, articles and appearances combined his writer’s vocation with that of a teacher. He’d met many types of people and was didactic in the widest possible sense – here is this joke, keep up before it’s gone; here is this word, you can learn it; here is my work, it exists and is part of culture, you can read it and also you might like to know that it is work, takes effort and that, for example: “When I hear a journalist like Malcolm Muggeridge praising God because he has mastered the craft of writing, I feel a powerful nausea. It is not a thing to be said. Mastery never comes and one serves a lifelong apprenticeship. The writer cannot retire from the battle, he dies fighting.” That’s art as a feet-on-the ground craft. And it’s writing as a way of being in the world – you get knowledge, you get skill, you get dignity, you get – if not righteousness, then some measure of contentment. Burgess saw the age of instantaneous fame coming, the toxic emptiness of much culture. It’s not at all an accident that another gentle ghost echoing through Earthly Powers is Tom, the music hall comic, the man who is praised towards the end of the book for practising a “comedy of kindness”. Burgess’s own humour could be less than kind – it was based on sharp observation, often of defects and stupidities, given that we’re only human – but he has Toomey describe Tom as a saint. In a book where there is a genuine miracle performed with terrible consequences, the spotlit clown is left the angel’s part. To see everything and still be kind – that is saintly. And educational. And entertaining. And a precious part of any healthy culture. \n• The series The Essay: Burgess at 100 can be heard on Radio 3 at 10.45pm, 27 February to 3 March.
