But now the scion of Lord Balfour is arguing that it is Israel that is causing anti-Semitism.\nRoderick Balfour's views are simply wrong both as a matter of fact and as a matter of morality. Anyone who hates Jews \"around the world\" because they disagree with the policy of Israel would be ready to hate Jews on the basis of any pretext. Modern day anti-Semites, unlike their forbearers, need to find excuses for their hatred, and anti-Zionism has become the excuse de jure .\nTo prove the point, let us consider other countries: has there been growing anti-Chinese feelings around the world as the result of China's occupation of Tibet? Is there growing hatred of Americans of Turkish background because of Turkey's unwillingness to end the conflict in Cypress? Do Europeans of Russian background suffer bigotry because of Russia's invasion of Crimea? The answer to all these questions is a resounding no. If Jews are the only group that suffers because of controversial policies by Israel, then the onus lies on the anti-Semites rather than on the nation state of the Jewish people.\nMoreover, Benjamin Netanyahu's responsibility is to the safety and security of Israelis. Even if it were true that anti-Semitism is increasing as the result of Israeli policies, no Israeli policy should ever be decided based on the reaction of bigots around the world. Anti-Semitism, the oldest of bigotries, will persist as long as it is seen to be justified by apologists like Roderick Balfour. Though Balfour does not explicitly justify anti-Semitism, the entire thrust of his letter is that Jew hatred is at least understandable in light of Israel's policies.\nBalfour doesn't say a word about the unwillingness of the Palestinian leadership to accept Israel's repeated offers of statehood to the Palestinians. From 1938 through 2008, the Palestinians have been offered and repeatedly rejected agreements that would have given them statehood. Even today, the Palestinian leadership refuses to accept Netanyahu's offer to sit down and negotiate a final status agreement without any pre-conditions. Nor does Balfour mention Hamas, Hezbollah, and other terrorists groups that constantly threaten Israel, along with Iran's publicly declared determination to destroy the state that Lord Balfour helped to create. It's all Israel's fault, according to Balfour, and the resulting increase in anti-Semitism is Israel's fault as well.\nRoderick Balfour ends his letter by essentially joining the boycott movement against Israel. He has declared his unwillingness to participate in the Centenary Celebration of the Balfour Declaration, until and unless Israel takes unilateral action to end the conflict. So be it. I am confident that the author of the Balfour Declaration would have been willing to participate in this celebration, recognizing that no country in history has ever contributed more to the world – in terms of medical, technological, environmental and other innovations — in so short a period of time (69 years) than has Israel. Nor has any country, faced with comparable threats, ever been more generous in its offers of peace, more committed to the Rule of Law, or more protective of civilians who are used as human shields by those who attack its civilians.\nSo let the Celebration of the Balfour Declaration go forward without the participation of Roderick Balfour. Let Israel continue to offer a peaceful resolution to its conflict with the Palestinians. And let the Palestinians finally come to the bargaining table, and recognize Israel as the nation state of the Jewish people in the way that the Balfour Declaration intended.\nAlan Dershowitz ( @AlanDersh ) is the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law, Emeritus, at Harvard Law School and author of \"Taking the Stand: My Life in the Law\" and \"Electile Dysfunction: A Guide for the Unaroused Voter.\" This article was previously published in Gatestone . \nAlso from the Washington Examiner Study: Fewer employers offering health insurance The percentage of employers offering insurance fell to 45.7 percent in 2015, a 1.8 percentage point drop from 2014.\nBy Robert King • 02/22/17 11:28 AM If you would like to write an op-ed for the Washington Examiner, please read our guidelines on submissions here. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:46:37.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
