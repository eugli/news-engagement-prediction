And while some problems have different solutions , others have answers that don't deal with numbers at all, like a Facebook post asking people to find a math mistake. \nThe photo, shared by Facebook user Antley Lamont Staten, shows a photo of a man holding up two sheets of paper.

Or are you trying to figure out what the issue is with the numbers? The answer is on the paper to the left — the man spelled \"mistake\" wrong.
