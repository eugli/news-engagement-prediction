I mean that literally: That Trump just lost a court battle over his travel ban. The two-week-old immigration order bans refugees and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States, and the block placed on it last week by Washington state judge James Robart last Friday was upheld by the 9th Circuit Thursday. \"SEE YOU IN COURT\" memes and tweets make fun of Trump's all-caps response to the news. \nBecause if there's one thing President Trump cannot bear to be, it's a loser. To Donald Trump, either one is a loser or one is a winner. If you happen to be a loser, you're in good company â Trump has said as much about figures including Meryl Streep, Hillary Clinton, John McCain, and, um, Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr. (Parenting goals, eh?) \nRemarkably, the Washington State attorney general also replied in caps: \"DENIED. Â UNANIMOUS. Â PER CURIUM,\" he tweeted shortly after the ban was announced. This is what 2017 has come to, ladies and gentleman: Our elected officials shouting at each other about who's going to get the last word. On Twitter. In all caps. \nHere are some of the best memes and tweets about \"SEE YOU IN COURT.\" 1.
