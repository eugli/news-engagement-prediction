They weren't outrageously expensive but they weren't cheap either. They were nice going out shoes.' Mr Bowman, a coach driver, said it was a 'miracle' that the car didn't end up going through their home in Kendal, Cumbria. 'It's our regular parking space, our driveway. She said her foot just hit the wrong pedal and she was in reverse so she just went off the end of the drive. 'The car must have finished up about two centimetres from the house.' Ms Wheatman, 47, had borrowed John Bowman's Toyota GT86 for a Saturday afternoon shopping trip when she accidentally reversed into their home (pictured) Mr Bowman - who described the car as his 'pride and joy' - decided to teach Ms Wheatman a lesson and cut up the Ted Baker heels (pictured) The prang caused Â£70 of damage, including a dent in the exhaust. 'The main thing is she's alright and the car wasn't too badly damaged,' he said. 'There's a dent in the exhaust from where it crashed into the windowsill but it could have been a lot worse. 'I've had the car for over a year and it's my pride and joy. We travel all over the country in it. I'm a bit of a petrolhead but as you can see, Katy can't handle it.' The mother-of-two said she usually wears trainers while driving (pictured) but wore heels this time instead The couple, who have been together for three years, share the car but Mr Bowman said his 'heart is in his mouth' when Ms Wheatman takes it out. She added: 'I wanted to move it straight away but John was having none of it. 'I do blame the heels. Usually I drive in my Nike trainers but I'd been out in the heels and didn't fancy changing them. 'I've parked there loads of times but you have to go up the kerb and it can be a bit tricky. I've just hit the wrong pedal and given it too much oomph. 'It shot back like a bullet. Obviously I'm very embarrassed. I'm just glad I didn't go through the window. 'John was mortified when he turned up but thankfully he took a deep breath and we've kissed and made up now.'
