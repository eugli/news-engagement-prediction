OPINION: Curtains are an insult to art and inmates \nThis newspaper reported last year that prisoners had been engaged to sew curtains as part of a programme endorsed by Mrs Muscat’s charity organisation, the Marigold Foundation. \nThe programme came under fire after inmates complained they had not received thousands of euros in payment for their services. The issue was eventually resolved. \nThis newspaper made a number of unsuccessful attempts to contact Ms Pisani about the programme and the payment her company received. All inmates concerned were duly paid for the supervised practical curtain making \nNo replies were forthcoming when a spokeswoman for the Home Affairs Ministry was asked why the material had been purchased from Ms Pisani. \nThe ministry was also asked whether the material had been purchased from Ms Pisani at market or cost price. \nThe spokeswoman would only say that the material had been used in “practical lessons” in which inmates produced curtains for a number of wards at St Vincent de Paul Hospital. \nThe cost of the material, the accessories and the installation of the curtains had been covered by the hospital, the spokeswoman said. \nNo reason was given why the direct order had been issued by the prison rather than the hospital. \nCurtain fabric retailers contacted by this newspaper said they would not sell the material for anything less than €10 per metre. Based on such a rate and excluding the cost of curtain rods and rails, the prison would have paid for about 10 kilometres of curtain material, enough to cover the distance between Valletta to Mdina. \nAlthough it was not clear whether the material had been purchased for the controversial programme linked to Ms Muscat’s charity, the spokeswoman said there “were no outstanding bills regarding this project and all inmates concerned were duly paid for the supervised practical curtain making”. \nThe project may not have been a one-off as the spokeswoman said that the correctional facility’s administration had offered male and female inmates the chance to enrol in “soft furnishings and ladies and gents tailoring” courses. She did not say who was running the course and questions on the matter remained unanswered. \nIt was only said that 13 inmates were participating in the new courses. « GO reports pre-tax profit of €28.1 million Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=45585438562&n=0fbdba68' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=45585438562&n=0fbdba68' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
