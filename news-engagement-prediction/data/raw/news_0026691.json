(Lulama Zenzile, Netwerk24) \nJohannesburg - The ANC on Tuesday repeated its call for the wearing of hard hats to be banned in Parliament. \nEFF MPs were using them as weapons, ANC spokesperson Zizi Kodwa said in a statement. \n\"This thuggish behavior is rather unfortunate and exposes the inability of the EFF to effectively engage on content by readily creating anarchy as a diversion.\" \nSome EFF MPs used their red hard hats to try and fight off Parliament’s security guards during their eviction from the National Assembly during President Jacob Zuma’s State of the Nation Address on Thursday. \nKodwa appealed to Parliament to act \"firmly and without hesitation,\" and protect the interests of millions of South Africans who relied on their elected representatives to advance laws and policies. \n\"The sideshows of the opposition parties, which at times degenerate into utter barbarism and criminality, will never detract us from the mandate given to us by the electorate,\" Kodwa said. \nEFF spokesperson Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said if the ANC was looking for a \"thug\", it need only look within. \nNdlozi said none of their MPs had been found guilty of violating their oath, unlike Zuma. \n\"Thuggish behaviour is Zuma who stole money to build his private home in Nkandla,\" he said.
