Construction could begin soon on the long-awaited second phase for the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, including the 1,700-seat Steinmetz Hall. (Handout) Jeff Weiner Center for the Performing Arts is set to break ground March 6, putting the venue’s third theater on track for a May 2020 debut. \n“Great things are worth waiting for, and this is certainly one of them,” Dr. Phillips Center President and CEO Kathy Ramsberger said Tuesday. \nBut first, Orlando’s City Council will be asked to sign off next week on the project’s expected cost of at least $227.5 million, a figure which has grown steadily in recent years as the arts center struggled to find funding for Steinmetz Hall, a planned 1,700-seat venue. \nThat work is not yet done, as the Dr. Phillips Center still must raise $14.7 million to fund all construction costs fully. Ramsberger said next month’s milestone should help with that, by convincing hesitant donors to get on board. \n“When you break ground, momentum is always very helpful for fundraising, because what you’ve been working on is more of a reality,” Ramsberger said. “ … We’ve had some donors that have been waiting to see if this project was going to be completed.” \nThe arts center was facing a much larger gap before a breakthrough in November, when Orange County approved a spending plan that freed up $45 million in hotel taxes for the project. \nThe City Council on Monday will also be asked to approve $10 million in contingency funding for the project, which would only be used in the event of unexpected cost overruns, according to the city’s chief financial officer, Chris McCullion. \n“For any project of this complexity, you don’t want to go without a contingency,” he said. “Things come up that need to be funded, from time to time.” \nThe contingency will come in part from reserves Orlando set aside years ago when it issued bonds for the arts center and other projects. The county took over the city’s debt obligations last year to give the arts center its $45 million boost, freeing up those reserves. \nThe proposed contingency money is restricted for use in community venues and downtown projects, officials said, and could not be used for other needs, such as to hire police officers or repair roads. \nApproved by the city and county as a $425 million project in 2007, Dr. Phillips Center was supposed to be finished in 2012, before a recession caused a dip in tourist-tax receipts, forcing local leaders to split the arts center’s construction into two phases. If current estimates hold, the Dr. Philips Center’s final price tag will comfortably top $550 million. \nSteinmetz Hall, expected to be the new home of Orlando's ballet and philharmonic, will be second-largest of the arts center’s three theaters, behind the 2,700-plus-seat Walt Disney Theater. \nThe hall is named for Chuck Steinmetz and Margery Pabst Steinmetz, who donated $12 million toward its construction in 2015. \nThe arts center’s second phase will also add a new rehearsal and performance space dubbed the Green Room, as well as additional back-of-house support spaces and kitchens. \nAt the time the $329 million first phase opened in 2014, the second phase was expected to cost about $186 million, but estimates climbed even as officials hunted for funding, something Ramsberger attributed mostly to market forces and an improving economy. \n“The costs go up the longer we wait, so the goal was to close the gap as soon as we could,” she said. \nPlaza Live renovations challenge Orlando Philharmonic » Caption Pine Hills home invasion results in one dead, deputies say \nPine Hills home invasion results in one suspect is dead and another in critical condition, sheriff’s officials say. \nPine Hills home invasion results in one suspect is dead and another in critical condition, sheriff’s officials say.
