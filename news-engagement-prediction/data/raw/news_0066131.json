Minnesotans -- including Prince, who died last year of a fentanyl overdose -- have been similarly affected. In Duluth, Minnesota, the owner of a head shop called The Last Place on Earth was selling synthetic drugs, causing an uptick in police calls, emergency room visits, and even deaths in the area. Luckily, law enforcement got him, and he was sentenced to 17 1/2 years in prison. But other dealers are still out there. And because of fentanyl and other synthetic forms of heroin, the drugs on the streets are getting stronger, more addictive and more dangerous. Heroin is already extremely addictive and cheap. But now it is increasingly laced with synthetic drugs like fentanyl, carfentanil, or U-47700 to make it even more potent. How powerful are these drugs? According to the Drug Enforcement Administration , it only takes about two milligrams of fentanyl -- about the same amount as a pinch of salt -- to kill you. Viral photo shows face of heroin America needs to see As the report states, a large majority of these synthetic drugs are made in labs in China and then shipped to traffickers in the Western Hemisphere. Typically, synthetic forms of heroin are shipped to traffickers in our country through the postal system. Unlike UPS or FedEx, the US Postal Service does not require electronic customs data for packages entering the country. That makes it easier on the traffickers and harder for our law enforcement to scan these packages for drugs like fentanyl or other smuggled products. And that leaves us more vulnerable to these international drug traffickers. In the United States Senate, we have made progress in the fight against the addiction epidemic. Last year, President Obama signed into law the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, with our strong support. It's the first comprehensive reform of federal addiction policy in two decades, and it will help bring down the demand for drugs in our communities, support treatment and long-term recovery for those struggling with addiction, and increase the availability of naloxone -- a life-saving overdose-reversal drug -- so that our first responders can save more lives.
