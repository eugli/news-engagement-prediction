Wilkinson was homeless and many said he changed the face of it. \n52-year-old Paul Wilkinson \nReverend John Pentland of the Hillhurst Community Church conducted the tribute. \n“Homelessness is just an issue or a topic or a cause, but suddenly it became a name, a person.” \nWilkinson came to the weekly services at the Kensington-area church and many said he was a remarkable reminder of humanity and humility. Homeless man who lost his family to be treated to day of luxury from Calgary businesses \n“He would never come in gracefully, it was always awkward,” church volunteer Anne Yates-Laberge said. “I miss the disruption and I miss his raw humanness in our presence. He’s not perfect and didn’t try to be – and I love that unpretentious being about himself.” \nWilkinson battled an addiction and in the end, it was how he lost his life. His best friend Shawn Gaudry shared the streets with him and said he respects what Wilkinson did. \n“Paul opened up everybody’s hearts to what homelessness was about,” Gaudry said. “He was the embodiment of the streets.” \nAnd the regular parishioners said he was always generous, even though he had very little. \n“He brought me a card with $100 in it and he said, ‘I want you to buy a new dress,'” Marsha MaPoy said.”He wanted me to buy something so I will remember always…so I did.” \nMany were encouraged to donate to the outreach program at Hillhurst Community Church in Wilkinson’s memory. \nHe was always donating panhandling money to the church or giving loonies to children, encouraging them to pay it forward. \nWilkinson was 52 years old. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:49:42.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
