Story continues below \nThe club says recent developments in the United States present “very serious and distressing implications” for some of their members. \nOn Friday, Trump signed an executive order prohibiting U.S. entry for passport holders of seven Muslim-majority countries, including Iraq, Iran, Sudan and four other countries, for 90 days. There is also a 120-day ban on entry for all refugees, and an indefinite ban for refugees from war-stricken Syria. \nOn its website, the Southsiders club says, “our supporter’s group was founded on the principles of inclusivity, acceptance and respect for all who sought to stand with us. Since our earliest days we have stood for equality, and we have spoken out against racism and bigotry. We have always strived to be the place where everyone feels welcome. We are the place where everyone belongs.” \nREAD MORE: Tens of thousands take to streets of US cities to protest Trump travel ban \nPresident Peter Czimmermann told Global News they took three hours to deliberate and make the decision not to travel south of the border. \nCzimmermann says only a couple of their members are directly affected, but there are quite a few who are uncertain about their ability to go. He says the games primarily affected include those taking place in Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon. \n“We try to stay away from politics as much as possible,” said Czimmermann. “I was not happy we had to have this discussion in the first place, but the reason we are doing this is because we are a group, we are almost a family and if one of us can’t go, then we are not going to organize a trip, where someone is excluded.” \nAfter giving careful consideration to the club’s Charter and Code of Conduct, Czimmermann said they have unanimously agreed on the following: \nBus trips : The Executive Board shall not coordinate any bus trips to the US until such time that the current conditions at border crossings have changed. We cannot in good conscience be responsible for arranging or hosting events or experiences which potentially come at the exclusion of some of our members, no matter how few in number those affected might be. \nAway tickets : The Executive Board recognizes it has an obligation to continue facilitating access to match tickets for away games. It is important that we protect the ticket allocation we fought very hard to gain control of. We are also mindful that many members booked flights and hotels prior to these recent developments. As such, away tickets will become available once kickoff times have been finalized. \nDecide for yourself : We are not asking our members to participate in protests or boycotts. We are not telling our members to stay home. You can make those decisions for yourself. \nRespect : We have just one request – if you travel to a Whitecaps game in the U.S. in the foreseeable future, we ask that you leave your Southsiders scarf at home as a sign of respect for members who cannot cross the border with the same ease and personal freedom as you do. \nREAD MORE: Fact Check: A look at Donald Trump, Sean Spicer’s comments on travel ban \nThe club will continue monitoring the border situation and advise its members of any changes in the future. \n“These are tumultuous and unpredictable times to say the least, which makes planning for the future extremely challenging,” the club said online. “Our ultimate goal is for all of us to move forward together in harmony and respect.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
