We don’t believe the company is doing that for us,” Moran said. \nEarlier in the day the UAW said Moran had never been paid by the union. \n“We can confirm that Mr Moran and others at Tesla have approached the UAW and we welcome them with open arms,” the union said. \nThe Fremont factory was once a UAW-represented operation owned by General Motors but became non-union when Tesla took over in 2010. \nTesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, told Gizmodo on Thursday that Moran was “paid by the UAW to join Tesla and agitate for a union. He doesn’t really work for us, he works for the UAW”. \nMoran said he had been congratulated by fellow factory workers since publishing a blog citing preventable injuries at the plant, mandatory overtime and workers being paid less than the auto industry average.

Tesla already builds Model S sedans and Model X SUVs at the plant. \nMusk is pushing to launch Model 3 production by July. He has projected output will reach 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018, roughly five times last year’s production. \nIn a video posted to the Fair Future at Tesla Facebook page on Friday, Moran said employees “spend more time at work than at home” and do not feel they can report health and safety issues. “ Tesla workers are fed up ,” he said. \nA Tesla spokesman did not return a call for comment. \nMoran’s blog charged that Tesla managers required workers to sign confidentiality agreements not to speak out about wages or working conditions. \nMusk, in comments reported by Gizmodo, said there was sometimes mandatory overtime but it was tapering off. \nHe said Tesla’s starting wages were higher than UAW starting pay and employees also received stock grants. Confidentiality agreements were meant to prevent company secrets from leaking, Musk said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T13:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T08:27:06.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
