Starting today, the restaurant is opening up its patio, adding alcohol and late-night service, and splitting its coffee shop into a separate operation on weekends. The covered patio features a walk-up bar that operates out of a converted shipping container. Joshua Fryer, previously of The Lawrence , and Timothy Faulkner, an alum of Le and Brown’s now-shuttered Lusca , are in charge of the new beverage program, which is comprised of cocktails, beer, and wine. The wine list is curated by Tim Willard, another Lusca alum. Late-night service, which begins at 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday, is similar to that of sister restaurant Octopus Bar . Look for dishes such as a lobster roll and the same burger that was routinely found on the menu at Lusca. Keith Remes has joined the team as head chef for 8 Arm’s dinner service, and Wilson Gourley is teaming up with Sarah Dodge on weekend brunch. Remes and Gourley are two more veterans of Lusca coming into the fold. 8 Arm’s coffee bar will operate independently of the main restaurant, with its own seating, during brunch service. 8 Arm is now serving coffee seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Breakfast is available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., lunch is served Monday through Friday from 1:30 p.m. to 3 p.m., and brunch runs Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dinner is on deck Monday through Saturday beginning at 6 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:08:12.807+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
