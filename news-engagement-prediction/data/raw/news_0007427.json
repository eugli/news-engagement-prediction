Nevertheless, organizations across the political spectrum readily agreed that Gorsuch represented an abortion foe in the mold of the justice he is slated to replace, the late Antonin Scalia. Neil Gorsuch nominated by Donald Trump to fill supreme court vacancy Read more \n“Neil Gorsuch has all the makings of an extreme anti-abortion justice,” said David S Cohen, a Drexel University law professor and a board member of the Abortion Care Network. “He is devoted to originalism, has decried using the courts for social change, and has protected the rights of religious Christians to impose their views on everyone else,” said Cohen. “Whether he will vote to overturn Roe v Wade is unknown, but the signs don’t point in the right direction.” \nGorsuch’s judicial rulings offer scant evidence of how he might rule on abortion rights. Still, there are myriad hints. Abortion opponents note his doctoral dissertation on assisted suicide, in which he thunders against “the intentional taking of human life”. Supporters of reproductive rights note that Gorsuch sided with an effort to defund Planned Parenthood and with companies opposed to providing their employees with contraceptive coverage in their healthcare plans. \nBut the best piece of evidence, all agreed, was the fact that Gorsuch’s thinking is closely modeled on the justice whose seat he might fill. That would be the late Antonin Scalia, whom Gorsuch called “a lion of the law”, and who was a reliable opponent on any question of expanding abortion rights. \n“He hasn’t addressed abortion head-on,” Cohen continued. “But he’s an originalist, and he’s very open about it, and originalism is pretty clear about abortion.” Because the original constitution and its later amendments say nothing about abortion, that thinking goes, abortion should be left to the states. “A conservative who believes in originalism thinks Roe v Wade is one of the worst decisions ever decided.” \nIf Gorsuch turns out to be a foe of abortion rights as reliable as Scalia, Trump will have fulfilled his loudest and most consistent campaign promise regarding the supreme court. After claiming, early in the presidential race, that he believed Roe v Wade to be settled law, and angering conservatives, Trump shifted course. He promised repeatedly and emphatically that he would nominate justices who would overturn the ruling. \nOn Tuesday night, pro- and anti-abortions rights activists alike appeared inclined to take Trump at his word that he had appointed one such judge. \nEd Whelan, the president of the conservative thinktank Ethics and Public Policy Center, praised him as a textual originalist in the mold of Scalia. \nAsked if he was confident of how Gorsuch would rule on abortion rights, he said, “I look at his interpretive methodology and his character and it gives me great comfort. It takes a very willful judge to misread the constitution on Roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood v Casey [another abortion rights case] and I don’t feel he’s that kind of judge. I feel comfortable about where he would end up on that case.” \n“Judge Gorsuch is a distinguished jurist with a strong record of protecting life and religious liberty, as evidenced by his opinions in the Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor cases, and in his doctoral dissertation in which he wrote that ‘human life is fundamentally and inherently valuable,’” said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B Anthony List, a political action committee that opposes abortion rights. \nBurwell v Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor, which was titled Zubik v Burwell, are two examples of cases in which Gorsuch, as a federal appeals judge, sided with a retailer and a religious nonprofit, respectively, that objected on moral grounds to providing contraceptives in their employee healthcare plans. Both employers believed, although it has no basis in science, that some contraceptives can cause abortions. And conservatives considered both cases to be victories. \nBoth cases ultimately played out before the supreme court. In Zubik, an eight-justice court punted the case back down to a lower court. But Hobby Lobby ended with a 5-4 conservative majority finding that Hobby Lobby, a closely held corporation that operated a chain of craft stores, had a right to raise a religious objection to providing contraceptive coverage. \nGorsuch, in his earlier, lower court opinion, went even further. He found that not only the corporation but also its individual owners could exercise their religion when it came to deciding their employees’ health benefits. \nAfter Trump’s announcement, some abortion rights advocates reserved their judgment of Gorsuch, hoping perhaps that his Senate confirmation hearing would turn up evidence that he was open to preserving some of their gains. Nancy Northrup, the president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal outfit that challenges many abortion restrictions, called on the Senate to interrogate where Gorsuch falls on the issue because of his lack of clear record. \nBut calls like these were in the minority. \n“The nation is steadfastly learning that ignoring even the most extreme of President Trump’s promises comes at our peril,” said Marcia Greenberger the co-president of the National Women’s Law Center. “So we take seriously his promise to nominate a justice who will overturn Roe v Wade. He promised we can count on it, and we do.” \nRegardless of his position, Gorsuch may not swing the court’s balance yet. Anthony Kennedy is considered the court’s decisive, swing vote on abortion cases. In June, he joined the court’s four liberals to hand abortion rights activists a major victory. It will probably take another Trump appointment, to fill a vacancy left by a liberal justice, to change this dynamic. \n“This is a guy whom most of the far-right conservatives in the country were hoping for, rooting for, and they got him,” said Cohen. “But his vote is not going to change the balance.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T14:28:35.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
