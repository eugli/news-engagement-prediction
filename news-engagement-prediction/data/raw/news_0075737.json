Image caption Stacey speaks to a human rights lawyer who says \"it's clearly violating and abusing the children\". \nSpeaking to the camera after being held, she claims: \"So I've just been kept by the police for the past two hours, they held us against our will, they would not let us go. \nFollowing the law change, the documentary examines what Japan is doing to stop normalising the sexualisation of children. \nStacey meets volunteers from a charity trying to help vulnerable girls, as well as the Head of the Juvenile Section at the National Police to find what they are doing to protect young girls. \nSpeaking about the type of men who meet up with teenagers in Tokyo she says: \"Those grown men intimidated me, I'm nearly 30 years old, a strong woman.\" \n\"So if they do have a relationship with these girls... They'd be very easy to manipulate. \n\"If they asked them to do something they didn't want to do, I don't know how confident they'd feel to say no.\" \nStacey Dooley investigates: Young Sex For Sale In Japan is available from Tuesday February 28 on BBC Three. \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T12:56:21.275+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
