According to commercial real estate firm NAI Avant, boba tea cafe Tapio took the opportunity to move from 65 Spring St. to around the corner to 221 1 ⁄ 2 Coming St. in order to expand its offerings. Tapio’s original mission was to bring boba teas to Charleston, but with the new space, the restaurant will expand its menu and offer Taiwanese and Thai cuisine. Owner Terry Hung says, “Tapio is all about family, and we believe family starts with good food and drinks. We have noticed that it is becoming more and more expensive to dine in Charleston. So, we set out to create something unique for Charleston but traditional for us that is affordable. We believe good eats transforms to happiness and happiness transforms into love.” Tapio should reopen this winter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:47:50.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
