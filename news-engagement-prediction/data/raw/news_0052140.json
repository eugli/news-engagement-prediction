Find out here with the Top 23 shows ranked by rating. TheWrap \n23. “CNN Tonight with Don Lemon” \nLemon’s primetime show averaged 924,000 viewers and is a unique combination of straight newscast and opinion programming. CNN essentially allows Lemon to do what he thinks will benefit viewers on a nightly basis, which was evident when he recently choked up remembering news legend Gwen Ifill. CNN \n22. “Erin Burnett Outfront” \nBurnett continues to be one of the most-watched programs on CNN, averaging 948,000 viewers on a nightly basis. CNN \n21. “The Kelly File” – repeat \nIt’s been quite a year for Megyn Kelly and the late-night repeat of “The Kelly File” averages one million viewers per night, topping the live edition of most cable news competitors. NBC \n20. “Hardball with Chris Matthews” \nMatthews averaged 1.05 million viewers to help MSNBC defeat CNN in the 7 p.m. hour during the wild political year of 2016.

CNN \n16. “Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell” \nO’Donnell, who was a writer on “The West Wing” before landing his MSNBC gig, averaged 1.24 million viewers in 2016. MSNBC \n15. “Fox & Friends” \nThe Fox News morning show hosted Steve Doocy, Brian Kilmeade and Ainsley Earhardt averaged 1.27 million viewers. By comparison, cable news rivals “New Day” averaged 508,000 and MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” averaged 677,000. Fox \n14. Fox News’ 2 p.m. ET Hour \nThis one is complicated, as “Real Story with Gretchen Carlson” occupied this spot until she filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, who eventually stepped down in disgrace. Carlson’s old show combined with a variety of replacements averaged 1.35 million viewers. TheWrap \n13. “The O’Reilly Factor” – repeat \nBill O’Reilly is so popular that the late-night repeat of his primetime show averaged more viewers than most competitors pick up on a good night, with 1.39 million viewers tuning into the second run of “Factor.” Fox \n12. “The Rachel Maddow Show” \nMaddow is the most-watched show that isn’t on Fox News Channel, averaging 1.43 million viewers. 2016 was Maddow’s most-watched year in the show’s history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:33:50.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
