However, the Galaxy C5 Pro hasn't been announced yet, while the other two are already available in markets other than China. Samsung Galaxy C5 Pro was spotted last year at Wi-Fi Alliance with model number SM-C5010, a variant specifically designed for the Chinese market. Fast forward two months and we have another Galaxy C5 Pro version that's been granted Wi-Fi certification, SM-C501X.We believe this is the international variant of the smartphone. Even so, this doesn't guarantee that the Galaxy C5 Pro will be available worldwide, just that it will not be China-exclusive.Based on previous rumors, the Galaxy C5 Pro is a more than decent mid-range smartphone since it packs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor , 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal memory.The large 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display with full HD (1080p) resolution puts it in the phablets category. Another selling point of the phone could be the 16-megapixel rear-facing camera, coupled with a no less impressive 16-megapixel selfie shooter.Since its bigger brothers, the Galaxy C7 Pro and C9 Pro ship with Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, there's a high chance that the Galaxy C5 Pro will run the same version of the OS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:46:56.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
