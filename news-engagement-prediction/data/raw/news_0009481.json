Source: YouTube \nThe rest of the video mainly features the pop diva rolling around on top of a car in white lingerie and a lacy garter or a black PVC leotard.\nMost of Carey’s new video ‘I Don’t’ is scenes like this. Source: YouTube \nLyrics like “Boy I was buggin’/ Thinkin’ somehow I can trust ya/ But you don’t mean nothing/ ‘Cause I don’t, I don’t” hint at what might’ve went on behind their heavily publicised relationship but it’s a scene from the video that speaks a thousand words — specifically the scene of Mariah burning a puffy wedding dress to ashes.\nThrowing the dress on the fire. Source: YouTube \nCarey leaves her wedding dress burning. Source: YouTube \nWhile the video might feature Mariah throwing her wedding dress on top of the fire, her engagement ring, valued at more than $10 million USD, didn’t suffer the same fate.\nThe video even features Carey giving the camera the rude finger with, you guessed it, the gigantic sparkler sitting on her middle finger.\nCarey’s engagement ring was front and centre in her new music video. Source: YouTube \nThe new single ‘I Don’t’ came after fans waited patiently for the pop diva to release new music and boy did she deliver.\nIn her docu-series Mariah’s World , the singer revealed she wrote the song “to heal.”\nAfter recording in the studio, the final episode ends with Carey taking off the huge diamond and leaving it on the music stand.\nMost would realise there’s a discrepancy in the timeline considering Carey ‘left’ the ring in the last episode of her show but is seen wearing it in the music video.\nIt’s still unclear whether ‘I Don’t’ and her single from last year ‘Infinity’ are the start of a new album.\nCarey’s last album Me. I am Mariah ... The Elusive Chanteuse was the singer’s 14th and most recent and was released in 2014.\nMariah is set to tour with Lionel Richie for their All The Hits Tour this year.\n\nWatch the entire video below.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:58:32.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
