The club's official website confirmed the England captain's intentions, as Rooney said he will remain in Manchester under coach Jose Mourinho. The 31-year-old's statement read: \nDespite the interest which has been shown from other clubs, for which I’m grateful, I want to end recent speculation and say that I am staying at Manchester United. \nI hope I will play a full part in helping the team in its fight for success on four fronts. \nIt’s an exciting time at the club and I want to remain a part of it. Jan Kruger/Getty Images The United legend has found himself on the edge of Mourinho's plans in recent months, losing his regular starting spot after the good form of Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Juan Mata. The 31-year-old has started only eight Premier League games this season, scoring twice, according to WhoScored.com . According to Simon Jones and Chris Wheeler for the Daily Mail , Rooney was ready to leave the Theatre of Dreams as he was unhappy with his lack of opportunities in Mourinho's squad. Rooney is still young enough to regain a place in United's starting XI, but the emergence of Mkhitaryan has compromised his position as a No. 10. The skipper's productivity has reduced after Sir Alex Ferguson retired from the Old Trafford hot seat, and Rooney does not have the pace needed to start every week for the Red Devils.
