What happened was, our partner on the left side of the stage, Brian Cullinan, he handed the wrong envelope to Warren Beatty,” PwC U.S. chairman and senior partner Tim Ryan told USA Today . “And then the second we realized that, we notified the appropriate parties and corrected the mistake.”\nCullinan had handed Beatty the wrong envelope as he walked out, leading co-presenter Faye Dunaway to incorrectly name “La La Land” as best picture winner instead of the true champ, “Moonlight.”\nA later-deleted tweet from Cullinan available on Google's archive. (Brian Cullinan via Twitter) The accounting firm executive and his colleague, Martha Ruiz, held identical briefcases containing all 24 envelopes of Oscar winners. Cullinan appeared to have accidentally pulled a duplicate card for Emma Stone’s best actress award — which she had already accepted onstage moments earlier — and sent Beatty on his way.\nMaking matters worse, Cullinan tweeted a since-deleted photo of Stone backstage just after her win at 11:05 p.m. Eastern, Google’s archive showed — roughly three minutes before he’d cause the biggest flub in Oscars history.\nCullinan, marking his fourth year of helping steward the top-secret results, had also tempted fate in the days leading up to the Oscars.\n13 photos view gallery Stars react to epic Oscars gaffe “We stand on opposite sides of the stage, right off-screen, for the entire evening, and we each hand the respective envelope to the presenter,” he told Medium in a Feb. 10 interview. “It doesn’t sound very complicated, but you have to make sure you’re giving the presenter the right envelope.”\nAnd in an eerily prescient interview with the Huffington Post , he addressed the unthinkable scenario that a wrong winner might be announced.\n“We would make sure that the correct person was known very quickly,” he said. “Whether that entails stopping the show, us walking onstage, us signaling to the stage manager — that’s really a game-time decision, if something like that were to happen. Again, it’s so unlikely.”\nCullinan and Ruiz have not yet commented on the debacle.\nTags: oscars  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:52:27.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
