A brief of evidence was handed to Victoria’s Department of Public Prosecutions, which is still considering the file. Pell has consistently denied allegations against him.\nThe motion “notes the allegations of criminal misconduct against Cardinal George Pell have been forwarded to the Victorian Office of Public Prosecutions by the Victoria police” and called on Pell to “return to Australia to assist Victorian police and the Office of Public Prosecutions with their investigations into these matters”. The motion was supported by the Senate.\n“Cardinal Pell has done a very good job at avoiding a return to Australia,” Siewert said. “I urge the cardinal to consider the view of the Senate and return to Australia as soon as possible”.\nBut overnight Pell’s spokesman issued a statement criticising the Greens.\n“The Greens have opted for an obvious political stunt while knowing full well Cardinal Pell has consistently co-operated with the royal commission and the Victorian police,” the statement said.\n“The suggestion that Cardinal Pell should be accountable for all the wrong doings of church personnel throughout Australia over many decades is not only unjust and completely fanciful but also acts to shield those in the church who should be called to account for their failures.”\nThe spokesman added that the Greens had an “anti-religion agenda” and that “most fair-minded Australians would see this motion as pathetic point-scoring”.\nSiewert dismissed Pell’s comments on Thursday morning.\n“I’m not going to lose sleep over the fact Cardinal Pell is upset we had motion to the Senate calling for him to come home,” she told Guardian Australia. “My focus is the thousands victims of abuse, many of whom would like him to come home to assist police in their investigation in person.\nPolice send sexual abuse brief about George Pell to prosecutors Read more \n“It’s important to note that, while the motion was put forward by the Greens, it was supported by the Senate as a whole. Cardinal Pell is the only one who seems to think this is a partisan political issue. It is time for Cardinal Pell to come home”.\nLast year, Pell gave evidence before the child sexual abuse royal commission via video link from the Vatican after his lawyers said that he was too unwell to fly to Australia to appear in person.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:22:29.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
