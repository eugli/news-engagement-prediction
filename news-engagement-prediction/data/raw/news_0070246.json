Directed by Alankrita Shrivastava, the movie stars actors like Ratna Pathak Shah and Konkona Sen Sharma in the main role and among other stars that feature in the movie are Sushant Singh, Vikrant Massey, Sonal Jha and Plabita Borthakur. The director and the producer of the film are all set approach the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) in order to get the movie a clearance and set a release date for it. A letter issued by the CBFC stated the reason behind its ban, it said, “The story is lady oriented, their fantasy above life. There are contanious sexual scenes, abusive words, audio pornography and a bit sensitive touch about one particular section of society, hence film refused under guidelines (sic).”\nAccording to Times Now reports, Director Alankrita Shrivastava in a statement said, “I believe the decision to refuse certification to our film is an assault on women’s rights. For too long, the popular narrative has perpetuated patriarchy by objectifying women or minimising their role in a narrative. So a film like Lipstick Under My Burkha, which challenges that dominant narrative is being attacked because it presents a female point of view. Do women not have the right of freedom of expression?”\nProducer, Prakash Jha in an interview with the media put forward his views on how no one should have the power to cut any scene and also that he is soon going to appearl in the tribunal against the decision of the censor board. He said, “We need to remove the censor and bring in certification, no one should have the power to cut scenes. The audience is mature enough to understand what is good or bad. It is not due to one person or CBFC; it is about right to take decision; the mentality and understanding. Yes of course I will appeal in the tribunal like I have done before, that is the only option.”\nActor Sushant Singh who features in the movie said, “Movie has been appreciated, no one became a loose character after watching, nor was any culture destroyed. CBFC thinks a female with sexual desires is bad for our society, but films with cheap sexual innuendos gets passed.”\nAccording PTI reports, Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) chief Pahlaj Nihalani said, “The film was not cleared by the examining committee and then it went to the revising committee which also declined certification. The makers can now approach FCAT and get it cleared from there. ” While talking about curbing the freedom of expression, he said, “It is not the first film in the history of the censor board to not get certification. We don’t go out and tell which film gets a certificate and which does not. It is their freedom of expression. Prakash Jha is an experienced filmmaker and he successfully managed to get his last film Jai Gangaajal released without cuts. It is his right to approach the tribunal and the court to get his film cleared.” CBFC CEO, Anurag Srivastava said, “There is no controversy, we followed normal process, filmmaker can go to tribunal.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:00:22.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
