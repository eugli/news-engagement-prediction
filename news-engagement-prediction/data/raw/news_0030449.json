Pitched at sufferers of lung disease, Parkinson’s, autoimmune conditions such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis and even Alzheimer’s,... (Michael Hiltzik) \nThe investigation is the product of the show’s so-called medical unit and its chief of staff, Michael Crupain, a medical doctor and public health specialist who was hired from Consumer Reports about a year and a half ago. At one point during his research for the program Crupain dialed in to a “webinar” in which prospective patients were recruited by a clinic. “It was like watching someone sell a time-share,” he told me—an observation that made it into the show. \nThe three segments, which take up about half of Tuesday’s scheduled program, include undercover visits to clinics in New York by Elizabeth Leamy, a reporter on the program, along with a former patient. At one point we see a clinic employee claim that he’s treated 44 patients for multiple sclerosis, and “every single patient had vast improvement.” The investigators are pitched $15,000 treatments and encouraged to “spread it out” on their credit cards. (No insurer will cover these untested and unproven therapies.) One promoter seen on tape acknowledges to the undercover team, “We don’t know the exact mechanism of everything we do,” but counsels them, “We just know that it works, we use it. If it works and it’s safe (and)...it’s reasonable in cost, you know, why not?” \nWhy not, indeed? Because the targets of these pitches are at the end of their rope, vulnerable to scamsters, and often have to make immense sacrifices to pay the fees. “Doctors and others can prey on their vulnerability,” Oz observes. \nOz displays a list of the conditions the clinics claim to treat—joint pain, autism, Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, stroke, emphysema, and blindness, among many others. He explains that it’s impossible for a one-size-fits-all treatment to cure them all: “It defies basic medical know-how, which means they are not telling us the truth.” He lucidly describes their supposed technique, which involves extracting stem cells from the patients by liposuction, separating the stem cells by centrifuge and treating them with some sort of enzyme, then reinjecting them in the patient’s body and waiting for the concoction to do its magic. \noffers a withering assessment of doctors who claim to be engaged in clinical trials of stem cell treatments but “ask you to give money up front and mortgage your house and borrow from your friends’ credit cards—that’s not how medicine should be practiced.” \nOz is assisted by talk show host and mulitiple sclerosis patient Montel Williams and Sally Temple, a stem cell scientist who is president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research. Temple explains that real research into stem cell treatments takes years and aims to develop treatments that can receive FDA approval. She quite properly underscores the danger to legitimate research posed by bogus clinics offering medically dubious treatments. “They’re saying they can cure a whole host of diseases, and we know they can’t,” she says. “We are really concerned that it’s going to undermine the genuinely good work that’s being done.” \nCrupain considers the stem cell investigation to be “Dr. Oz at his best.” He’s right.
