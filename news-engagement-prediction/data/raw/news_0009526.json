You aren’t doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isn’t, so I just might send them down to take care of it.” \nThe excerpt did not make clear exactly who Trump considered “bad hombres”– drug cartels, immigrants, or both? — or the tone and context of the remark. \nIt also did not contain Nieto’s response. \nBoth the U.S. and Mexican governments denied details from the AP’s report with a spokesman for Nieto saying: \n“I know it with absolute certainty, there was NO threat. The things that have been said are nonsense and a downright lie.” \nUSC Latin America Professor Gerardo Munck says if Trump’s comments are real, it could damage the nation’s important relationship with its neighbor south of the border. \n“It’s as undiplomatic as you can get,” Munck said. “One expression that comes to mind is sort of ‘cowboy diplomacy’ do this or else. I don’t think that’s the way to deal with a neighbor, a big neighbor that’s been a very reliable ally of the United States.“ \nAnd things also reportedly got heated in a phone call this weekend between Trump and the prime minister of Australia when Trump objected to an agreement over the U.S. receiving refugees. \nTrump reportedly ended the call abruptly because he was unhappy. \nAnd tonight he tweeted: Do you believe it? The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia. Why? I will study this dumb deal! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017 \nThe phone call between Trump and Pena Nieto was intended to patch things up between the two leaders in light of Trump’s determination to have Mexico pay for the border wall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T14:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T17:15:00.333+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
