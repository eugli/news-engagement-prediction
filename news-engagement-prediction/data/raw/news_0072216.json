A Weapon No More Dangerous … \nOpponents of the AWB claimed that assault weapons are generally no more dangerous than many other readily available firearms. Most of the defining characteristics included in the AWB do not hinder or enhance the weapons’ effectiveness or accuracy. While semi-automatic weapons can be fired faster than other firearms, a large number of semi-automatic rifles, pistols and shotguns remained legal in the U.S. after the adoption of the AWB. \nThe AR-15, one of the rifles that became an assault weapon with the passage of the AWB, is a .223 caliber. The .223 is smaller and less lethal than many rifle calibers. In most states, a .223 is not permitted for hunting big game because of the caliber’s ineffectiveness at bringing down animals such as deer and elk. Assault Weapons Defined by States \nThree U.S. states — California, Connecticut and New Jersey — had passed their own ban on certain firearms defined as assault weapons prior to the passage of the AWB in 1994. New York and Massachusetts have since added assault weapon bans. \nIn each state, assault weapon definitions loosely follow the defining characteristics included in the 1994 federal legislation. In Connecticut, the law applies only to firearms specifically named as assault weapons. The law applies to any firearm meeting the definitions set forth by statute in each of the other states. Availability and Usage of Assault Weapons \nThe exact number of legally-owned firearms in the U.S. falling under the general assault weapons definition is unknown. Estimates range from four million to 10 million. Either way, the number represents a small fraction of the 230 million firearms legally owned in the U.S., according to the National Rifle Association . \nResearch by noted firearms researcher David B. Kopel shortly before the AWB was implemented revealed that assault weapons were used in less than one percent of gun crimes in the U.S. \nShortly after the law was allowed to sunset in 2004, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study of the AWB, finding that there was \"insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness” of the law for reducing crime rates. Expanding the Definition of Assault Weapons \nPolitical efforts in the years since the AWB expired have sought to expand on the definition of assault weapons. \nRep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, introduced legislation in 2007 that would renew the AWB and expand the law to include other guns by reducing the number of qualifying characteristics from two to one. Rep. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, introduced legislation the following year that would have reauthorized the AWB for 10 years with only minor expansions of the assault weapons definition. Neither bill advanced past a subcommittee of the House of Representatives . \nRep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, introduced H.R.4269, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2015, in December 2015. The bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations in January 2016. It had 149 Democratic co-sponsors as of October 2016, with 218 co-sponsors necessary to pass the House of Representatives. The bill would outlaw all AR-15 and AK-type rifles manufactured anywhere in the world, as well as all civilian versions of military rifles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:00:38.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
