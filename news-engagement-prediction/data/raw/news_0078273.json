It feels like a lot less,” said retired LAPD Officer John Caprarelli, who exchanged gunfire with robbers Larry Phillips Jr. and Emil Matasareanu, who were killed in the gun battle. \nThe day isn’t just remembered for the heroics of some of the outgunned officers, or the way the incident played out on live television, but also for how it forever changed law enforcement. \nThe suspects were better armed and prepared than the officers who responded, City Councilman Mitchell Englander said. \n“That was a wakeup call,” he said. “Not only is this weaponry available to the mass market, but anybody can deploy it for any reason. So the (police) weaponry changed … the tactics and the training changed. Every law enforcement agency in the country changed in how to respond to those incidents.” \nPhillips and Matasareanu had meticulously planned the armed robbery at the Bank of America branch at 6600 Laurel Canyon Blvd. for months, and had even calculated the expected LAPD response time by listening to police scanners. But they did not foresee that two police officers would happen to drive by and see them as they entered the bank. \nBy the time they exited the bank eight minutes later, police had surrounded the building and the robbers immediately unloaded their illegally altered assault rifles, striking multiple officers. \nIn all, the robbers fired about 1,200 rounds at officers, civilians and even a police helicopter. But hundreds of officers converged to surround the area, preventing their escape. An injured Phillips took his own life and Matasareanu surrendered but bled out at the scene. \nPolice in Los Angeles eventually became better equipped as a result of the shootout. If a similar situation were to happen today, one of the first officers responding would likely be armed with his or her own assault rifle. \n“Not only are police more equipped, but the tactics deployed are all different, in like how to take cover to reduce risk to the officers and the general public,” said Englander, who is also a reserve officer with the LAPD and chair of the council’s Public Safety Committee. \nCaprarelli and Englander planned to be on hand for a shootout remembrance event Tuesday at the LAPD’s North Hollywood Division. Mayor Eric Garcetti, Police Commission President Matt Johnson, Chief Charlie Beck and Councilman Paul Krekorian are also scheduled to attend. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
