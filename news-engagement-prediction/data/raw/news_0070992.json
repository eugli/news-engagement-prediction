In a note shared to their Facebook page, the band’s Jake Ewald stated that the cancellations are for the members “to take a break from Modern Baseball for a little while,” and also explained that the band had become an “immense source of anxiety for me.” He shared that feeling with his bandmates, who felt the same way. “The project we started as a source of joy and positive expression had become something that was slowly eating away at our mental health and our friendships,” he wrote. “Please know that we don't take a tour cancellation lightly, and under any other circumstances we would not even consider it an option, but in this instance we have to put our health and friendships first.” Read the full note below. \nEarlier this year, Modern Baseball’s Brendan Lukens announced that he would not be joining the band for their European and UK shows, also citing the need to focus on his “mental and physical health.” In 2015, Modern Baseball canceled tour dates in order for Lukens “to focus on making steps towards positive mental health.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:38:29.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
