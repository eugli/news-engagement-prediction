Close MKR's Colin jokes about overthrowing Pete and Manu UP NEXT VIDEO MKR's Colin jokes about overthrowing Pete and Manu. Source: Kyle & Jackie O MKR's Colin jokes about overthrowing Pete and Manu \nLike the Perth pals, they’re the young, giggly girls of their group - but would their cooking skills be as bad as Ash and Bek’s record-breaking low? \nIt’s time to find out as the second episode of Colin’s group takes us to the Uni students’ Instant Restaurant, Vogue Chic. Named for their love of fashion, of course. Ponytails on point. Source: Channel Seven \nThe gals say they love “fusion” food, and they try to combine Italian and Japanese whenever they can. \nWith the two cuisines being so vastly different, it sounds like a disaster in the making! As Colin ponders: “if this young and brave, or young and naïve?” Colin is confused by the menu. Source: Channel Seven \nWe don’t know, Col, but we love your thinking face! \nAfter shopping, prepping and welcoming the guests, the gals get down to making their special Japanese mayo, which has a very controversial ingredient: MSG. Oh, dear. MSG! Source: Channel Seven \nOf course, judge Darren Robertson comes in just as they’re using the MSG – the timing is uncanny, right?! \nWe don’t usually like using MSG,” Demi admits. “For this mayonnaise, we’ve tried making it without MSG and it just doesn’t have the right consistency to it.” Time for a lesson from Professor Darren. Source: Channel Seven \nSee, the girls think it is a thickening agent – until Darren sets them straight that it’s a flavour enchancer. In a cooking competition. The girls can’t believe how stupid they’ve been, but it’s too late now! \nWhen they serve up their entrée of bundt salmon sushi complete with the mayo, Darren makes them ‘fess up to what they added to the dish and everyone is most displeased – especially Colin. Grumpy Cat (or Mell?) is not happy about the MSG. Source: Channel Seven Cyn is shocked! Source: Channel Seven This is the face of a man who hates MSG. Source: Channel Seven \nThe girls stand there looking like school kids that have just been yelled at. Aw, chins up ladies! \nThey work hard on their Japanese burger in an effort to redeem themselves and it is a big fat fail – even with the big “Kardashian” buns the girls have made. Colin has notes on the burger. Source: Channel Seven \nStill feeling the sting of being yelled at for the MSG, the budding fashionistas take the criticism hard. “I know you’re saying it’s fusion,” Colin says. “But they’re conflicting flavours and it sort of ends up as confusion.” Sniff! It's not nice being yelled at. Source: Channel Seven \nCaitie bursts into tears after this stern dressing-down. So it’s time for a Fassnidge pep talk! That inspirational quote was Instagram worthy, Colin! Source: Channel Seven \n“Sometimes the best thing to happen to you is to get knocked down,” he says, as a million hearts break around the country. “Because if you don’t get knocked down you can’t get back up.” This just in: Colin is actually a big softie! \nBuoyed by this wise advice, the girls bounce back into the kitchen for their big finale: matchamisu. Yes, it’s more fusion and yes, it looks like something that would grow in a swamp, but it’s their last hope. The matchamisu ain't the prettiest thing ever. Source: Channel Seven \n“This was your best course yet,” says a very nice person that used to be Colin but now we don’t know who he is. The gals are thrilled by Colin's positive feedback. Source: Channel Seven \n“Your Italian-Japanese fusion, you actually pulled this off. And I’m so glad you did.” \nRELATED: MKR's Court fires back at Josh \nOne person isn’t as impressed. “I think this is a one time expedition into the world of Japanese-Italian fusion,” Cyn the villain sniffs. \nStill, the girls score a very respectable 60 – Ash and Bek wish they could have pulled that off! \nWant more celebrity, entertainment and lifestyle news?
