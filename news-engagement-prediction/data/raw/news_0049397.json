Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017 \nWhite House spokeswoman Susan Sanders also put out a statement saying the president wasn’t referring to a specific incident: NEW: @SHSanders45 re POTUS&Sweden: “He was talking about rising crime&recent incidents in general, and not referring to a specific incident” \n— Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) February 19, 2017 \nThis may be the segment he’s referring to where Ed Henry, filling in for Tucker Carlson, discussed migrants in Sweden and crime: turns out \"what happened last night in Sweden\" actually just means \"last night I was watching Tucker Carlson talk about Sweden\" pic.twitter.com/6z5pfOJ7Yv \n— Ashley Feinberg (@ashleyfeinberg)   \nThe Swedish embassy had earlier tweeted that it had asked U.S. officials for an explanation: @theclevertwit Qs about #swedenincident , unclear to us what President Trump was referring to. Have asked US officials for explanation. \n— Embassy of Sweden US (@SwedeninUSA) February 19, 2017 \nAs we told you earlier, many journalists jumped on Trump, accusing him of promoting a terror attack that never happened. Journos claim Trump referred to ‘nonexistent terror attack in Sweden’, transcript proves otherwise #SwedenIncident https://t.co/spNwAuTBEI \n— Twitchy Team (@TwitchyTeam) February 19, 2017 \nAlthough it was clear from the transcript/video that he never referred specifically to a terror attack. Trump, discussing terror, seamlessly mentions incident \"last night in Sweden\". \nThere was NO \"incident\" in Sweden last night. pic.twitter.com/XtcC4PRiNU \nFrom the New York Times : \n“You look at what’s happening,” he told his supporters. “We’ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden . Sweden, who would believe this?” […] \n“Sweden,” he said. “They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible. You look at what’s happening in Brussels. You look at what’s happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris. We’ve allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country and there was no way to vet those people. There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we’re going to keep our country safe.” \n***", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:12:21.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
