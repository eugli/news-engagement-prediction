He then abducted her in her own ambulance before taking her to scrubland and raping and murdering her. \nHer husband Keith Woodford was asleep inside their home. When he woke and found her gone, he believed she must be assisting someone with a medical emergency — something that was common for her to do. \nLater that morning colleagues from her community clinic began to fear the worst when she hadn’t returned and the ambulance was missing.

Picture: Channel 7 Source: Supplied \nA desperate search began with police eventually tracking the GPS from the ambulance to a location on the outskirts of town. Mrs Woodford’s body was found nearby in a shallow grave. \nHis guilty plea at the Port Augusta Magistrates Court means for the first time the real Davey can be unmasked. \nTragically, he had only recently completed parole for an “appalling” attack on a woman outside an Adelaide convenience store in 2012. \nThat involved a woman who had passed out after a night out with friends, who Davey lay on top of and sexually assaulted. A witness told police he saw Davey making thrusting motions on the woman, who had her knees bent. \nThe woman remembered nothing, but woke in hospital with scratches on her face and a chipped tooth. \nWhen he was sentenced for that in 2013, the court heard he had only just been released from jail, but was not on any community-based supervision. \nMagistrate Bob Harrap described Davey’s offences as appalling, and warned he would need to have the “fortitude” to deal with his alcohol problem that had been his “demon”. \n“Alcohol has been his demon for a number of years. Clearly it’s a problem with which he needs to continue to wrestle, otherwise I suspect Mr Davey will simply continue to commit the cycle of offending he’s been involved in over the years and continue to spend time in custody,” he said. Gayle Woodford was known by to be kind and generous by community members. Source: Supplied \nTragically for Mrs Woodford, that was exactly what happened. \nEven Davey’s own lawyer, Mike Norman, admitted he was out of control when he had been drinking. \n“He is two people ... when he is sober he is an absolute pleasure, when he is drunk he is an absolute menace.” \nDavey was jailed for three years, and released on parole after 20 months, to the APY Lands — a dry zone that was supposed to help with his rehabilitation. \nHe completed his parole for that crime just six months before he murdered Mrs Woodford. Because he was no longer on parole he was not legally required to be on any community-based supervision. \nBut it was far from his first assault against a woman. The 2012 incident came after he was released from jail for a series of other assaults, including intent to rape, a violent attack on a 12-year-old girl and stalking a woman through an Alice Springs hospital carpark. A desperate search through the outback began after Gayle Woodford was abducted. Picture Simon Cross Source: News Corp Australia \nThat took place when Davey was just a teenager. Court documents reveal why the victim believed she was about to be raped. \n“He placed both arms around her torso. She struggled. She fell face first to the ground. He fell on top of her. He placed her in a headlock. He placed both hands over her mouth to prevent her screams. She eventually managed to break free and alert passers by. The victim suffered abrasions to her shoulder and a sore neck and lasting psychological consequences. She naturally enough believed that she was the victim of a sexual assault as opposed to a mugging.” \nUnder SA law, Davey is now subject to a mandatory head sentence of life in prison, with a non-parole period of at least 20 years — unless a judge finds special reasons warranting a lower minimum term. \nDavey remains in Yatala Prison ahead of sentencing submissions in the Supreme Court in Adelaide that will begin on March 20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:29:11.038+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
