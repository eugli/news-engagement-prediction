Joe Wojcik Gatesman, Pittsburgh’s sixth-largest advertising agency, has added a trio of accounts all based outside Pennsylvania. Thorntons Convenience Stores, NPI Holdings Corp. and INVO Coconut Water each chose the South Side-based agency after competitive reviews. CEO John Gatesman said the business burst means adding at least five new posts across creative, public relations and digital. John Gatesman plans to add five new people since his agency landed a trio of accounts. Joe Wojcik “We’ve been fortunate and continue to stay strong with organic growth,” Gatesman said. “This was reflective of fourth-quarter business planning, a natural time for clients to start looking for an agency or to replace one. And there is an air of confidence from all of our clients that the economy is on a positive trajectory.” Gatesman declined to break out specific financials but said that, combined, the accounts add more than $1 million to the agency’s revenue. “We like to say we’re headquartered in Pittsburgh, but we certainly don’t view ourselves as only a Pittsburgh agency,” Gatesman continued. “When you reach a certain size, it provides a level of confidence to clients outside the market that you’ve got the horsepower to deliver.” Founded in 2006, the agency employs 82. It listed 2015 total revenue of $16.8 million. Thorntons, based in Louisville, Ky., is a $2.3 billion gasoline and convenience retailer operating throughout the Midwest. It tapped Gatesman as its public relations and social media partner, and responsibilities include strategy, media relations, influencer outreach, cause marketing and reputation management. NPI, through its subsidiaries, manufactures and sells wall panel solutions for the building products, signage, transportation and other commercial markets. It named Gatesman agency-of-record for its Marlite and Nudo brands, which includes handling branding, marketing and communications strategy and new product launches. NPI is owned by Grupo Verzatec of Monterrey, Mexico; Marlite is based in Dover, Ohio; and Nudo in Springfield, Ill. Gatesman also will do design and packaging work for San Francisco-based brand INVO Coconut Water. The new business wins follow several changes at the agency late last year, including shortening its name from Gatesman+Dave following the departure of its chief creative officer. Shannon Baker , who had led public relations, was appointed president in October, enabling Gatesman to focus on new business and growth opportunities. “We ushered in a new marketplace-driven agency model that broke down the silos to ensure consumers and insights are at the heart of all we do, and we’re also very aggressively pursuing our next acquisition,” Gatesman said. Where or what Gatesman wants to buy wasn’t disclosed. Its last major transaction was in 2013 when the agency effectively doubled its size by buying Quest Fore Inc., also based in Pittsburgh. Pre-deal, Gatesman was the city’s No. 15 agency, and Quest Fore was No. 17. Patty Tascarella covers banking, finance and the legal industry. Contact her at or 412-208-3832.
