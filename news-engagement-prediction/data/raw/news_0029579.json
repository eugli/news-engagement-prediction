The Cavaliers also sent cash down to owner Michael Jordan and the Hornets in the deal. \nCharlotte, which is fighting for one of the final playoff spots in the Eastern Conference, waived Andersen immediately. \nBasically, as Sam Amico reports, the deal had the Cavs giving Charlotte some cash now for luxury tax relief later. \nMore interestingly, Amico of FOX Sports Ohio also is reporting the Cavaliers are not nearly done in advance of the trade deadline \nAmico says the Cavs \"plan to aggressively explore more trades as the leagueâ€™s February 23 deadline nears, the source told Amico Hoops.\" \nLeBron has reportedly backed keeping around 10-day contract contributor Derrick Williams for a longer deal. \nOther names are certain to pop up in the rumor mill ( Carmelo Anthony , anyone?), especially given Kevin Love's uncertain injury situation . Among the biggest needs is back-up point guard, where rookie Kay Felder has played in 34 games. Coach Tyronn Lue has even used Williams there already in a big-lineup experimentation. \nIf the Cavs are able to find someone to bring them over the top again, LeBron can, in part, thank his old friend, the Birdman.
