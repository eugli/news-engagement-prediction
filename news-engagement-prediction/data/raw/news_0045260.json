But taking on the first Oscars of the Trump era — where tensions are sure to be high and speeches politically charged — is an even dicier proposition. If Jimmy Kimmel is nervous, however, he's a master at hiding it. Sitting with THR in his dressing room following a Jan. 17 taping of ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live! , the 49-year-old funnyman (who also hosted the 2016 Emmys in September) is relaxed and effusive. Not even the impending mayhem in Washington, D.C., seems to rattle him —\"My guess is that there will probably be some new crazy thing we're all talking about,\" predicts Kimmel, well before \"alternative facts\" and national security adviser Michael Flynn's resignation commanded the national conversation — as he only hopes for fodder to keep the show moving and the audience laughing. \nYou know, you once sent me an email. \nOh, you must have written something nice about me. \nIt was about the Oscars, actually. It was two years ago when Neil Patrick Harris got the hosting gig. I reported that he was their third or fourth choice. \nOh, I wonder what I was. I had to be at least eighth. ( Laughs. ) It took so long for them to ask. \nDid you expect it? \nNo, not at all. In fact, I had decided that I had a date in mind — I don't remember exactly what it was — but if they don't ask me by this date, I'm not going to do it. And then a month later, they asked me to do it, and my agent is like, \"Of course you're doing it.\" I was like, \"Oh, OK, I guess I'm doing it.\" \nWhat do you feel has been missing from the Oscars the past few years? \nI don't know if anything has been missing, but the things that have worked best on the Oscars are things that you don't know how they're going to turn out — like when Ellen [DeGeneres] orders pizza for the audience, I think that that's a real gamble. Garry Shandling did a great thing on the Emmys once where he blindfolded this young couple, and they didn't know they were coming to the Emmys, and he brought them out onstage and unmasked them and got their real reaction to suddenly being onstage at the Emmys. And that's something that you don't know how it's going to go. It's a real swing, and I like to take a couple of those. That makes the show more fun. Of course, it also raises the potential for something bombing miserably. \nAre you going to give the Oscars audience food like the PB&J sandwiches you passed out in paper bags at the Emmys? \nI will absolutely figure out some way, whether it be on camera or off, to make sure the audience has food. \nHow do you feel about all the political speeches at recent awards shows? Can the politics detract from the proceedings? \nIt depends on the speech, you know? I think that you've got a group of people who are largely very liberal, although I will say, the first time I hosted the Emmys, I had a joke about there being no Republicans in the room, and a surprisingly big group of people clapped when I asked if there were Republicans, and I was a little bit thrown by it. So I don't think the audience in its entirety is as liberal as people in Middle America imagine it is. But the celebrities, most of them are pretty liberal. If I was nominated and I was going to stand on that stage, I think I'd be intimidated by how good Meryl Streep's [Golden Globes] speech was, so I'd probably keep my mouth shut when it comes down to it. \nIn your Emmys monologue, you took a lot of jabs at Trump. Now that he's president, how does that change things? \nI don't think it necessarily changes anything. I don't know where we'll be mentally on Feb. 26. I don't know if we'll feel like we're past that stuff or if there will be some new crazy thing we're all talking about — my guess is that there will probably be some new crazy thing we're all talking about, so it really depends largely on what's going on that week. And I would definitely make those decisions the day of or day before as to how much material I do and what my spin on it is. \nMatt Damon's Manchester by the Sea is up for best picture. Have you thought about — ? \nI'm going to do everything I can to make sure that he doesn't win or doesn't know that he won. My goal is to keep him offstage. \nThis story first appeared in the Feb. 24 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
