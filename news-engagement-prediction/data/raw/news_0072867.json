Labour’s share of the vote in Copeland has been falling for 20 years and of course I take my share of responsibility. \n“Both these areas, like many others in Britain, have been left behind by globalisation and lost out from a rigged economy. So it’s no surprise that they rejected the status quo by voting to leave in the EU referendum. That’s why it was important for Labour to respect the result and vote for article 50.” Labour faces catastrophic loss of working-class support Read more \nCorbyn said his party had not yet done enough to “rebuild trust with people who have been ripped off and sold out for decades and don’t feel Labour represents them”. He said he was confident the key to success was in party unity. “If we stand together, I am confident we can do that and turn back the Tory tide,” he wrote, saying he was determined to “finish that job” as party leader. \nShami Chakrabarti , the shadow attorney general, was more forthright in pinning the blame for the defeat on the MPs who had challenged Corbyn over the summer. Labour had long been the political establishment in Copeland, she told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show. \n“You cannot weigh people’s votes, you have to cherish them,” she said. “Yes, we lost, but I believe when people see what Mrs May’s hard Brexit looks like, and they see a vision from a more united Labour party as I believe we can be, they will change their minds. In Copeland, Labour has looked like the establishment for a long time. \n“We have suffered from disunity and if we’re always talking about the leadership that won’t help us cut through.” \nOver the weekend, senior Labour figures said Corbyn should launch a full party inquiry into the loss of the seat. The deputy leader, Tom Watson , and the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, both suggested the Labour leader should do some soul searching. \nWatson, speaking at the Scottish Labour conference in Perth on Saturday , raised the spectre of the party’s virtual wipeout in Scotland being repeated south of the border as he called for Labour to take a “long, hard look at ourselves and ask what’s working” before it is too late. \nStarmer, in a speech in London, said the “worst thing” Labour could do would be to “normalise defeat” and “walk past” results that were disastrous for the party and merited an honest admission that all was far from well. \nThe Unison general secretary, Dave Prentis, whose union had backed Corbyn for the leadership, said the Labour leader “must take responsibility for what happens next” and “show he understands how to turn things around and deliver just that”. \nChakrabarti said the public criticism of Corbyn would only further damage the party. “What I would say to Dave Prentis and other great men of the left is that it’s time to unite,” she said. “Constant attacks on the leadership, constant leadership elections don’t allow us to focus on the issues that would allow us to present an alternative vision.” \nCorbyn’s speech at the Scottish Labour conference in Perth later on Sunday will stress not only the importance of party unity but across the Brexit and national divides. “The policies and ideas we are setting out are policies whose time has come,” he will say. \n“But to win that fight we need to remain united. United in our belief in our movement. United in our commitment to once again make our society fairer, better and more just. That’s why Labour believes that together we’re stronger. Unity is still our strength.” \nHe will also challenge the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, to end talk of a second independence referendum, urging her to “listen to the people and respect democracy”.
