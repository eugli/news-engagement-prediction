I’ll be calling Dubai home for the next four weeks as I undertake an internship at the Gulf News.\nHere are the ups and downs — or trials and tribulations if you will — of my journey in Dubai as I navigate currency conversions, complex public transport and sample a new cuisine in a new city... Day One\nBefore leaving, I’d found myself a room to stay in a villa in Umm Sequeim via Airbnb. My first port of call after I arrived was to acquaint myself with the neighbourhood. So on my first day, I went for a walk around the block — a common outing back home in Australia. One thing about Dubai became clear as soon as I embarked on this endeavour: the blocks are very, very big. An intended 20 minute walk easily stretched into two hours — I’m grateful for the burger shop and beach nearby that made it a rather refreshing one.\nAs I hit the final corner of the block, I finally arrived at a supermarket. Here, I could complete my second very important mission for the day: grocery shopping. One thing I did not anticipate was the amount of sheer choice that would be available! My ‘quick shop’ soon became an extended wide-eyed stroll through meticulously clean aisles offering a range of cereals and snackbars I’d never seen before (although my eyes did become substantially wider when I looked at some of the price tags!). Naturally, I examined each option scrupulously before settling on a few Australian brands that I am familiar with. I picked up a copy of GN Weekend to prepare for my internship, headed to the checkout (Dh150, or A$50, for three small bags of groceries made me a little queasy) and lugged my very valuable bags of shopping through the streets that remained to complete the circuit. Abu Dhabi\nOn our second day, myself and Alison (another intern from Sydney at the Gulf News) had to be in Abu Dhabi at 2.30pm for an appointment with the Australian embassy. Alison’s roommate kindly offered to give us a lift and we decided to make a day of it.\nThe Shaikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi looked beautiful in photos we’d seen, so we decided to visit before our meeting. Knowing it was in Abu Dhabi, we assumed it would be at least relatively close to where we’d been dropped off near the water (probably based on the fact most of Sydney’s key landmarks are walking distance apart). Not the case! A Google maps search put a 3 hour and 40 minute walk out of the question and our lack of an Abu Dhabi bus pass meant public transport was also ruled out. Against our instinct as Sydney-siders (where cabs are pricey), we hailed a taxi and were surprised that after 25 minutes, we still weren’t quite there. Luckily, taxi rates here are half the price of what they are back home, otherwise the lengthy return trip would have put quite a bit of pressure on our budgets! The mosque was stunning though so it was worth it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T19:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T14:33:43.873+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
