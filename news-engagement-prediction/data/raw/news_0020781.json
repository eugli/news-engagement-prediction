Jeff Sessions was confirmed as the next attorney general on Wednesday. (KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated:   11:01 PM \nA laundry list of human rights groups, religious organizations and outraged Democrats blasted the confirmation of Jeff Sessions as the new attorney general, ripping the longtime Alabama senator's controversial record on civil rights and race relations. \nAll Democratic senators but West Virginia's Joe Manchin voted against Sessions at the Wednesday night confirmation vote, while Republican senators unanimously threw their support behind President Trump's pick. \nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who was formally silenced by Republicans on Tuesday after criticizing Sessions on the Senate floor, had harsh words for the new attorney general. \n\"Deeply disappointed that the Senate confirmed an AG whose record does not show he will faithfully & fairly enforce the law,\" she tweeted . \"There's no Rule 19 to silence me from talking about Jeff Sessions anymore. So let me say loudly & clearly: This is just the beginning…If Jeff Sessions makes even the tiniest attempt to bring his racism, sexism & bigotry into @TheJusticeDept, he'll hear from all of us.\" \nThe NAACP, which Sessions once called \"un-American\" and \"Communist-inspired,\" saluted the millions of Americans who protested Sessions' nomination, and pledged to continue to vigorously follow his every move. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren warned Sessions that the backlash against him \"is just the beginning.\" (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) \n\"Rather than hang our heads in despair, the NAACP will continue to hold the new AG and the Department of Justice accountable,\" the civil rights organization said in a statement , adding that its members will put pressure on Sessions to uphold \"protections against voter suppression, the use of consent decrees as a means of reigning in racism within police departments, protection of women's rights and the humane treatment for immigrant communities\" — all issues that Sessions have been criticized for advocating against in the past. \nSessions, the first senator to endorse Trump's presidential bid, was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 over allegedly suppressing African-American votes, repeatedly voting against hate crime legislation and staunchly opposing any immigration reform. One of Sessions' colleagues at the time also testified that the 70-year-old senator made light of the Ku Klux Klan , and joked that he didn't have a problem with its members until he found out some of them smoked marijuana. \nWade Henderson, the President and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, ripped Sessions' confirmation as a \"grave mistake.\" \nSen. Jeff Sessions confirmed by Senate as attorney general \n\"Confirming Sessions has jeopardized the equal and fair treatment of people of color, women, the LGBT community, people with disabilities, immigrants and refugees,\" Henderson said in a statement. \"Sessions has an extreme 30-year record of demonizing these communities and has built his career on disregarding the rule of law and fueling hostility towards the protection of civil rights.\" President Trump tapped Sessions as attorney general in November. (MIKE SEGAR/REUTERS) \nThe LGBTQ-rights advocating Human Rights Campaign criticized Sessions for lamenting the Lawrence v. Texas decision, which ended the criminalization of same-sex relationships in 2003. \n\"The man now in charge of enforcing hate crimes protections doesn't even think they should exist — or that LGBTQ people need them,\" HRC President Chad Griffin said in a statement. \"Our message to Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions is this: we're going to fight any attempt to roll back our rights with every resource we have. We will not give one inch.\" \nAndrea Miller, the president of the National Institute for Reproductive Health, lambasted Sessions over opposing the Violence Against Women Act and calling the landmark Roe v. Wade decision a \"colossal\" mistake for guaranteeing women the right to abortion. \nSpicer says he'd hope MLK Jr.'s widow would back Sessions for AG \n\"It's disgraceful that a man who has espoused anti-woman positions — and whose racist views cost him a federal judgeship — would be entrusted to seek justice in cases that affect the lives of so many communities across this country,\" Miller said in a release. Protesters wearing white KKK sheets shout at Sessions as he arrived for his confirmation hearing on Jan. 10. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) \nThe ACLU had a simple message for Sessions. \n\"If he violates the Constitution, we'll sue,\" the legal advocacy group said over Twitter . \nRabbi Jack Molie, the president of the Interfaith Alliance, questioned Sessions' ability to separate his \"far-right\" Christian views from judicial rule. \nSenate bars Elizabeth Warren from criticizing AG nominee \n\"During his confirmation hearing, Sessions suggested that 'secular' attorneys in the Justice Department are less qualified than religious ones at assessing 'truth,'\" Molie said in a statement. \"This troubling and unconstitutional support for a religious test for office is consistent with his support for President Trump's Muslim ban and dismissal of church-state separation as 'unhistorical and unconstitutional.'\" Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke was thrilled over Sessions' confirmation. (Gerald Herbert/AP) \nBut some were thrilled by Sessions' confirmation. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted that \"our nation will be better\" with Sessions as attorney general. \n\"Fair in action, bound to the constitution, a defender of civil rights,\" McConnell added. \"This is the @SenatorSessions we've come to know and will see as AG.\" \nDavid Duke, the former grand wizard of the KKK, was also all smiles. \n\"Thank God after 8 horrible years of black radical Marxists we finally have an AG who will defend decent American people — rather than thugs,\" Duke tweeted .
