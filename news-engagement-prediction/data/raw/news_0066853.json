YWCA Columbus is taking the wraps off a transformative renovation of its home in the historic Griswold building downtown. The nonprofit organization has completed a $25 million project to remake the women’s housing facility from dorm-like units with shared kitchen and bathroom facilities to 91 independent apartments. 12 photos The basketball court now houses the administration offices for the Women’s Residency. See the slideshow for a look inside the more than 90-year-old facility at 65 S. 4th St., last updated in the 1990s. The Columbus Partnership held its first quarterly meeting of the year in a newly renovated ballroom. A grand opening event is scheduled for Thursday. “This has been an extensive transformation that has greatly upgraded the living space of the women’s residency, in addition to condensing administrative space for streamlined work flow,” CEO Elfi Di Bella said in a statement. “All this was accomplished while preserving the historical integrity of the building and as a tribute to the lasting legacy of the organization.” YWCA Columbus launched a fundraising campaign in 2014 , raising more than $10 million to supplement $15 million in state historic tax credits. Work began in the summer of 2015. Berardi & Partners Inc. designed the project. Capacity was increased from 60 women to 91, with administrative offices relocated within the building.
