Its shallow muddy waters confuse the whale’s sonar, leaving it vulnerable to stranding by an ebb tide, according to marine environmental organization Project Jonah. \nPilot whales are not listed as endangered, but little is known about their population in New Zealand waters. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T03:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:17:56.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
