Credit: Mrs Burdett \nThe father of a two-year-old girl who died from meningitis has accused the government of doing \"absolutely nothing\" to raise awareness of the disease. \nNeil Burdett's daughter Faye died a year ago, her death sparked a nationwide online petition for more children to be given the vaccine. \nThe petition was one of the most-signed in the history of Parliament's site with over 820,000 people calling for all children to be given the Meningitis B vaccine, Bexsero.

There is just this massive hole that children are falling into. \n\"We have been through something so terrible and we thought if we could stop it happening to other families, that's what we wanted to do. \n\"But since going to Parliament, we've heard nothing.\" \nMr Burdett and his wife Jenny, 36, spent every day at Faye's hospital bedside. \n\"She could hear and she could react,\" Mr Burdett said. \"Every morning I would sit with her and she would squeeze my finger. \n\"Once, she opened her eyes and she looked around. She mouthed the word 'mummy'. We never heard her voice again because of the ventilator.\" \nThe couple made the decision to switch off Faye's life support after doctors told them her chance of survival was minimal. \nThe couple had already signed forms consenting to amputations but knew that sepsis had caused extensive damage to Faye's body. \nMr Burdett said: \"Her kidneys weren't working and the list went on and on. \n\"She had fought so hard. Turning off the machine was the hardest decision we have ever had to make but it was the right thing to do. We've never regretted that decision.\" \nHe said: \"She was such a happy little girl but that's the thing with meningitis - in the click of a finger, it all changes. \n\"She loved painting and was very clever for her age, she was so bright and determined\", he added. \nMr Burdett said there is an ongoing investigation into the treatment Faye received as she was sent home but returned seven hours later. \nLast year, former public health minister Jane Ellison pledged to launch an awareness campaign for parents on the signs of meningitis and the government agreed to release its cost-calculations for vaccines. Mr Burdett described his daughter Faye as very bright, happy and loved to paint.
