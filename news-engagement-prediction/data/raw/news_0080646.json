It was the first time that Islamic State had claimed responsibility for an attack in Indonesia. \nIslamist militant attacks had been relatively rare in Bandung, about three hours away from Jakarta. Provincial police spokesman Yusri Yunus said the situation was “under control” in Bandung after the bomber was killed. \n(Reporting by Agustinus Beo Da Costa and Gayatri Suroyo; Additional reporting by Kanupriya Kapoor; Writing by Ed Davies and Eveline Danubrata; Editing by Michael Perry & Simon Cameron-Moore) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:33:43.294+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
