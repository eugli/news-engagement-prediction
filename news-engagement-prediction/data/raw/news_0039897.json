Although, the U.S. Department of Education has so far declined to say why these twelve districts were selected. \nIn December, federal officials heard from hundreds of parents during a series of “listening sessions” across the state. Parents shared stories of how Texas schools were delaying and even denying special education testing. \nAfter the December “listening sessions”, the U.S. Department of Education sent the TEA a letter stating it has “serious concerns” about Texas’ declining special education enrollment numbers. \nSince 2004, special education enrollment in Texas schools has dropped from 11.2 percent to 8.5 percent of the student population, according to state reports. \nThe 8.5 percent puts Texas below the national average of more than 13 percent of students receiving special education services. \nAccording to TEA records, Everman ISD’s special education enrollment has dropped in the past years from 11.6 percent of the student body to 7.8 percent. \nHowever, the district officials told the CBS 11 I-Team the total number of students it served in special education during the 2015-2016 school year was 10.6%. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
