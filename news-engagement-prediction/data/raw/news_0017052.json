Photo: Time \nIn a celebrated interview with the Hollywood Reporter in the days after Trump's stunning election win, Bannon broke with the customary it's-all-about-the-boss spiel in cheerfully drawing a parallel between himself and Dick Cheney and some other unsavory notables - \"Dick Cheney. Darth Vader. Satan. That's power,\" he said. \"It only helps us when they get it wrong. When they're blind to who we are and what we're doing.\" \nGoing further, Bannon found his own image in Henry VIII's 16th century England. Lighting on the man credited with splitting the Church of England from the Catholic Church, an earth-shattering achievement, he told the Hollywood Reporter : \"I am Thomas Cromwell in the court of the Tudors.\" \nThe Time profile of Bannon contains this revealing passage: \"'Where Bannon is really having his instinct is on the policy front,' says a longtime Trump ally. \n\"Which policies? 'All of them. He&'s Trump's facilitator.' In a Trump White House, this adviser says, you can only get-- and keep-- as much power as the President wants you to have. But Trump and Bannon 'sat down before the election and made a list of things they wanted to do in office right away,' says this adviser. Trump is the one deciding which items to tick off. 'Bannon's just smart enough to give him the list.'\" \nIn his encounter with the Hollywood Reporter , Bannon embraced the description of himself as a nationalist – but baulked at \"white nationalist,\" before racing ahead to talk as though he was the new president – for decades to come. \n\"I'm not a white nationalist, I'm a nationalist. I'm an economic nationalist,\" he insisted. \n\"The globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia. \n\"The issue now is about Americans looking to not get f—ed over. If we deliver we'll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and we'll govern for 50 years. \n\"That's what the Democrats missed, they were talking to these people with companies with a $US9 billion market cap employing nine people. It's not reality. They lost sight of what the world is about.\" \nForeseeing an American populism that would be \"greater than the Reagan revolution — conservatives, plus populists, in an economic nationalist movement,\" he declared: \n\"We're going to build an entirely new political movement … It's everything related to jobs. The conservatives are going to go crazy. I'm the guy pushing a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan. With negative interest rates throughout the world, it's the greatest opportunity to rebuild everything. Ship yards, iron works, get them all jacked up. We're just going to throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks.\" \nThe jobs and infrastructure plan might have been a more uplifting opening act for the Trump presidency, instead of kicking at migrants and refugees. \nBut how would Rove or Cheney have handled this transition? \nObviously at this early stage, Democrats are more likely than Republicans to take Bannon apart – but there are reports of head shaking in GOP circles; and a number of senior congressional Republicans have spoken out on the botched roll-out of the migration crackdown. \nIt's an easy shot for Democrats to charge that Bannon is Cheney or Rove incarnate - \"Karl Rove on steroids,\" as described by House minority leader Nancy Pelosi's spokesman Drew Hammill in the weekend. \nAssessing the political advantage for the Democrats, Politico concludes: \"Democrats see an opportunity to turn Bannon into a figure whose mere presence rallies the Democratic base, as Rove did when he was dubbed 'Bush's brain.'\" \nBut a thoughtful piece on the progressive website ThinkProgress, argues that the comparison doesn't work, because the Trump-Bannon machine doesn't have the disciplines that Bush-Rove-Cheney had, to create a false, but believable alternate political universe – which was \"a willingness to tell many little lies that were internally consistent, mutually reinforcing, and at least superficially plausible, as they added up to one big lie.\" \nNed Resnikoff, a senior editor at ThinkProgress, argues that despite not being true, the Bush administration's Iraq narrative was compelling - \"Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, Al Qaeda was in cahoots with virtually all of America's enemies, and the United States was a messianic crusader that would eventually spread capitalist liberal democracy to every corner of the world.\" \nIn conceding the \"clear internal logic\" of the fantasy world constructed by Bush and Rove, Resnikoff writes: \"Whereas President Bush offered America the illusion of morality clarity, President-elect Trump offers an ever-shifting phantasmagoria of sense impressions and unreliable information, barely held together by a fog of anxiety and bewilderment… something more like an endless bad dream - think Kafka more than Lord of the Rings.\" \nThere is some support for Resnikoff's argument in opinion polls – Americans bought the Bush-Rove fantasy, to the extent that as many as 93 per cent of them believed it on the eve of the US-led invasion in 2003, according to Gallup; but a poll for CNN in the weekend, found that 53 per cent of Americans did not approve of Trump closing the door to migrants and refugees from the seven countries. \nAnd on cue, in another unhinged performance on Monday, Trump again proved Resnikoff's point that Team Trump is not capable of fabricating the 'believable' lie. \nSpeaking to the military brass at Central Command in Florida, Trump departed from his prepared text to make this startling claim: The media are intentionally covering up reports of terrorist attacks. \n\"You've seen what happened in Paris, and Nice. All over Europe, it's happening,\" he ad-libbed. \"It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. They have their reasons, and you understand that.\" \nBannon has had a rough start. But maybe he'll find his feet – or Trump will find them for him. \nAnd to some observers, as a political novice, his weakness is his strength – having spent his career chopping the establishment of both parties off at the knees, he has no political safety net. \n\"If he hit a bump, there is no personal support mechanism to sustain bad times: Tom Rath, a Republican strategist in New Hampshire, told ﻿ Politico ﻿ . \"But perhaps he has a pretty good hold in the only personal relationship he needs. He has a constituency of one.\" Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:31:50.242+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
