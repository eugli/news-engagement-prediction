(Photo: David Bailey, AFP/Getty Images) \nFor her Sapphire Jubilee, Queen Elizabeth II is looking blue — as in a blue dress and a magnificent set of blue sapphires and diamonds draped around her neck and dangling from her ears. \nFor special occasions, the queen, who will be 91 in April, is known to bring out the big-league baubles in her fabulous jewelry collection. On Monday, she marks her 65th year on the throne of the United Kingdom — an achievement unmatched by any other British monarch and precious few others in world history, so it's definitely special. \nFor the occasion, she reissued a picture by famed photographer David Bailey, taken in 2014, that shows her in a sparkly blue dress and wearing a suite of sapphire jewelry: A necklace of emerald-cut sapphires surrounded by diamonds and separated by individual diamonds, plus a pair of pendant earrings each with a single large sapphire in a diamond cluster, and all set in gold. \nPrince William admires the David Bailey Portrait of the Queen as he visits the GREAT British Festival of Creativity on March 3, 2015 in Shanghai, China. (Photo: WPA Pool, Getty Images) \nThe sapphire set is especially dear to the queen because it was a gift from her father, King George VI, whose death on Feb. 6, 1952, brought her to the throne. \nThe Victorian Suite (it was made in the mid-19th century in the reign of her great-great grandmother) was bought by the king at Carrington & Co ., and given to the then-Princess Elizabeth in 1947 as a wedding present when she married Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, 95. \nPrincess Diana's sapphire engagement ring on the left hand of Kate Middleton when her engagement to Prince William was announced Nov. 16, 2010. (Photo: Arthur Edwards, AP) \nShe had the necklace shortened by four links in 1952, and later the largest cluster was turned into a pendant to hang on the necklace. In 1963, the Queen commissioned a tiara and bracelet to match.She also has the Prince Albert Sapphire Brooch, given to Queen Victoria by Prince Albert the day before their wedding in 1840 and passed down from queen to queen ever since. \nSapphires are prized by British royals, and the Crown Jewels are peppered with them. Prince Charles gave Lady Diana Spencer a large sapphire engagement ring before their 1981 wedding, and after she died in 1997, it passed to her sons; it now resides on the left hand of Prince William's wife, Duchess Kate of Cambridge. \nBut the queen will not be out and about wearing sapphires on her Ascension Day: The anniversary is bittersweet given it also marks the death of her beloved father. So, as usual, she will spend the day quietly at her private estate in Norfolk, Sandringham. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Annie Leibovitz, Buckingham Palace,AP Fullscreen Queen Elizabeth II overtakes her great great-grandmother Queen Victoria as Britain's longest reigning monarch, at just over 63 years, on Wednesday. At 89, hers is the most famous, most photographed, most painted face in the world. She's on the money, on the stamps, and on many, many official portraits, more than 130 painted portraits alone over her reign, according to Buckingham Palace. The British National Portrait Gallery in London has more than 900 images of her at last count. Take a look at some of her portraits, starting with \"warts and all-style\" depiction by royal portrait painter Richard Stone. This 1980 artwork makes no attempt to hide her wrinkles, furrowed brow and graying temples.

His characteristically uncompromising and unflattering style features her glum expression, her jowly and severe facial features. The painting was shown in 'Royal Treasures: A Golden Jubilee Celebration,' the inaugural exhibition at the new Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, that opened in May 2002. Royal Collection, via AFP Fullscreen Every British official building and ship around the world has a portrait of the queen.
