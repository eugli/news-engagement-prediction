The unveiling coincides with the Mahashivaratri festival being celebrated today in India. \n\nThe unveiling of Adiyogi bust has also attracted controversy. Several environmental groups and political outfits have urged PM Modi not to attend the event as they believe that the construction of Shiva murti is in violation of environment laws. \n\nHere are seven things to know about the event and the controversy: \n\n1. The scale \nThe Adiyogi bust is claimed to be the largest by Isha Foundation. The bust, made of steel, weighs 500 tonnes. It was designed in 2.5 years and built in eight months. \n\n2. The symbol \nThe bust is 112-feet tall, and it's not a coincidence. According to Isha Foundation, Shiva as Adiyogi opened up 112 possibilities for human beings to reach their ultimate potential, and the bust symbolises those possibilities. \n\n3. The event \nThe unveiling of Adiyogi Shiva bust is part of the largest Mahashivratri celebrations in the country which will be telecast live, simultaneously in seven languages to over five crore people through more than 23 satellite television channels and several online platforms. Isha Foundation expects nearly 5 lakh participants to attend the event. \n\n4. The mega yoga drive \nPM Modi will light the sacred fire to commence the Maha Yoga Yagna across the world in which one million people will take an oath to teach a simple form of yoga to at least 100 people each in the coming year, and touch at least 100 million people before the next Mahashivratri. \n\n5. The power quotient \nThe list of big politicians attending the event includes chief ministers Shivraj Singh Chouhan (Madhya Pradesh), Chandrababu Naidu (Andhra Pradesh), Vasundhara Raje (Rajasthan) and Edappadi K Palaniswami (Tamil Nadu). Tamil Nadu governor Vidyasagar Rao, Puducherry lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi will also attend the event. \n\n6. The politics \nTamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami may use this event to establish a rapport with Prime Minister Narendra Modi by flying down to Coimbatore to receive him at the airport. This gesture may help soften his relationship with the Centre which was perceived to be against government formation by the Sasikala group. \n\n7. The controversy \nA PIL in the Madras High Court has challenged clearance for constructing the bust by Isha Foundation. It claims the catchment area of the Noyyal river is being obstructed by the construction. It says the bust adversely affects biodiversity and violates building bylaws. A few environmental groups and political outfits have asked PM Modi not to attend the event and also threatened to stage protests. However, Isha Foundation says it has got all the necessary approvals for construction.
