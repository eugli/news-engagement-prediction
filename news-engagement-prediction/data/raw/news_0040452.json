He died in the arms of sister Elizabeth, then 13, when she returned home from school to find him collapsed and bleeding. \nIt is believed he had at least three people in the house with him and there were no signs of forced entry, meaning it is thought he may have been known to his killers. The firearm has never been recovered. \nBilly, who had attended Ernest Bevin College, had been in Acre Lane, Brixton , in the hours leading up to his death before returning home where he was found at 2.36pm. \nDetective Sergeant Jason Grafham today told the Standard he believes the case is still “solvable”, but is hoping someone will feel comfortable to come forward with information. \nHe said: “There is no doubt there were gang stresses and strains. I wouldn’t want to give the gangs the credence of naming them. Whatever it was, there is no justification for what happened. \n“Some more information might get us home on this. Just one strand of information is all we need to achieve it. I’m confident someone in and around that area still knows what happened. This case is solvable, we just need a bit more help.” \nHe added: “As time passes people’s lifestyles and allegiances can change and these people may want to help us get justice for Billy and his family.” \nA friend turned up to Billy’s house after the shooting, which his sister heard from outside the home, to help give first aid, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. \nThe shooting in 2007 caused then Scotland Yard chief Sir Ian Blair to call together his top officers for a crisis meeting about gun deaths. \nIt came days after Michael Dosunmu, also 15, was shot by two gunmen who burst into his home in Peckham and 16-year-old James Andre Smartt-Ford was shot and killed at a crowded ice rink in Streatham. \nBilly’s mother today said her husband passed away five years ago of a “broken heart” over their son’s death. \nShe added: “I got home straight away [from work that day]. I saw all the police tapes around the road and by the house. My husband and the police came towards me. I shouted to my husband ‘please don’t tell me that my son is dead.’ My husband said ‘yes darling, he is.’ \n“I fell to the ground. I cried and cried until I had no tears left and I wanted to die with him. I had to accept the truth that my son had left us. \n“Every year we have a commemoration to remember him at the temple. I miss him so much. His life was taken away at such a young age. But I have to be strong because I still have my daughter to live for. \n“I would like to seek justice and I’m appealing for anyone who has any information about this case, no matter how small it is, to come forward and inform the police so that they can catch the person who shot him. I am sad to think that nobody is still interested in my son’s case.” \nAnyone with information is asked to call the incident room on 020 8785 8267 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
