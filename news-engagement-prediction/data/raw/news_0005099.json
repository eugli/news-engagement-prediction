Sporting News \nPublished on Jan. 30, 2017 \nJan. 30, 2017 \nMelbourne Demons legend Garry Lyon has returned to the media spotlight following a hiatus from the public eye, in a radio interview with renowned footy personality, Mike Sheahan. \nMORE: Dustin Martin puts Richmond contract talks on hold \nIt was revealed last year that Lyon was in a relationship with Channel Nine colleague and good mate, Billy Brownless’ ex-wife, a relationship which is reportedly still ongoing. \nThe former Demon revealed he apologised to Brownless via text message, however did not get a response from the former Cat. \n“It was a text, yeah,” Lyon said on SEN Breakfast . \n“I spoke to Bill before this became public a year or so ago. \n“Beyond that, it’s something for he and I to work through. We will do it. If he wants to talk about it publicly, then that’s his right. But I won’t be.” \nAnd while he admitted that he was sorry for starting a relationship with Nicky Brownless, he confirmed the pair are still together. \n“I’m not saying that I was jumping out of my skin to talk to Bill about it,” Lyon said. \n“There’s no easy way to broach that subject. Whether I’d do things differently in hindsight, maybe. What I do know is that there was a lot of hurt that resulted from it. I have to live from that. Nicky and I are together. \n“I am eternally grateful that she was able to support me through the back half of this. That’s the end of it.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T03:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:07:34.989+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
