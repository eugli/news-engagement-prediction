I want to clarify to our hometown exactly the values for which Under Armour and I stand.” \nPlank went on to explain that, in Baltimore, the company stands for “entrepreneurship, job creation and opportunity,” and affirming the brand’s commitment to American manufacturing and its opposition to the travel ban set in motion by President Trump. \nThe letter also stated that the company believes “immigration is a source of strength, diversity and innovation for global companies based in America like Under Armour,” adding, “I personally believe that immigration is the foundation for our country’s exceptionalism.\" \nThe letter comes in the wake of mounting pressure from celebrity athlete endorsers, including Stephen Curry, Misty Copeland and Dwayne Johnson, who spoke out publicly in opposition of Plank’s pro-Trump comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T00:24:35.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
