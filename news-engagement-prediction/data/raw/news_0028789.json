Worse is that he does not remember anything, and is unable to help himself get out of the ordeal. \nNot all hope is gone though as the synopsis for \"Criminal Minds\" season 12, episode 13 teases BAU will get the help of the International Response Team to get Reid off the hook. \nIt is unclear how it will turn out, but seeing that the episode is teased to be a game-changing one for Reid and the group, big things will happen in \"Spencer.\" \nThere is a reason to worry about Reid's fate in \"Criminal Minds\" season 12, episode 13 simply because the installment was co-written by Kirsten Vangsness. \nAs fans know, she is notorious for writing episodes that change the course of the series such as the one that marked Derek's (Shemar Moore) last day in the force and the other that saw Gideon's (Mandy Patinkin) death. \nVangsness admitted to TVLine that \"Criminal Minds\" season 12, episode 13 will be a \"game-changer\" for Reid although fans hope it does not involve the character's death. \nThe star, who plays the role of FBI technical analyst Penelope Garcia in the series, did point out that \"Spencer\" will change Reid's course in the series. Just how that will happen, fans will learn soon enough. \nExecutive producer Erica Messer teased that \"Criminal Minds\" season 12, episode 13 \"launches a journey for [Reid] and for the team that I would argue we never even imagined would happen â and yet it happens, and we're along for this ride. And it's an intense one.\" \n\"Criminal Minds\" season 12, episode 13, \"Spencer,\" airs Wednesday, Feb. 15, at 9 p.m. ET on CBS.
