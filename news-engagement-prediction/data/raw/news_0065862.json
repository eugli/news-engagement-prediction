Watch | Paul Nuttall: Ukip's time will come 00:42 \nM r Nuttall told reporters this morning that Ukip was \"not going anywhere\" and insisted the party's \"time would come\". \nBut Mr Oakden acknowledged that the party could face a long haul if it was going to increase its tally of one MP. \nHe told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme: \"Look, something clearly didn't fire yesterday in as much as the fact that we didn't win. But this is - politics is a long game. Ukip candidate and party leader Paul Nuttall after losing the Stoke-on-Trent Central by-election Credit: Joe Giddens/PA \n\"We've been aware of that for quite a long time. You know it took us 23-odd years to win a referendum to get Britain out of the European Union. \n\"It may take that long for us to get a seat in Westminster via a by-election. But if that's how long it takes, then that's what we will keep doing, because that's what we're here for.\" \nD ouglas Carswell, who defected for the Conservatives to Ukip, was elected in the 2014 Clacton by-election. Stoke Central by-election results \nM r Oakden acknowledged Mr Nuttall had endured a \"difficult\" campaign, in which he had to apologise over a false claim that he lost close friends in the Hillsborough disaster, but said he had the full support of the party. \n\"This party is absolutely behind Paul Nuttall as its leader. He is 12 weeks into his leadership. We are all going to support him moving forward. This is one step along a long road for our party,\" he said. \n\"He has had a difficult campaign. There is no doubt that he has been targeted by various unpleasant elements during the last four weeks. \n\"I think it was incredibly courageous of him to put his head above the parapet and stand to be the candidate for our party in this election. \n\"He did it to unify our party. I think by the evidence of the number of people who came up to support Paul during this campaign, that is what happened.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T15:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T10:59:52.688+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
