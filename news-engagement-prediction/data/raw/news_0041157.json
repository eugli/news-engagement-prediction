A veterinarian who examined the cat says an arrow had gone through the animal's head, passed through her esophagus and then came out of her shoulder blades. The vet removed the arrow and says the cat is expected to survive.

Photo: NOAA Texas man arrested after being caught dragging German Shepard behind his motorized wheelchair 1 / 23 Back to Gallery \nA Mission man was arrested Thursday morning after a video showing him dragging his German Shepard behind his motorized scooter surfaced on Facebook. \nMario Cardona, 59, was charged with animal cruelty just 15 hours after the disturbing video surfaced online. \nMelissa Janelle Torrez, who was on her way to the store, spotted her neighbor dragging the dog across the street. She quickly parked and pulled out her phone to record the incident. \nThe profanity-laced video captured the man's actions. WARNING: The video contains graphic content and language that can shock, offend and upset - view the video with caution. \nA woman confronted Mario Cardona, 59, as she noticed him while driving through a neighborhood in Mission. Media: Melissa Janelle Torrez \nIn the video, Cardona is heard saying, \"Call 'em [the cops]! It's my dog!\" Torrez did exactly that and waited for the police at her house. Just 15 hours after Torrez's complaint was filed, Cardona was arrested, KVEO reports . \n\"You know something like this is great because somebody actually provided us with video evidence,\" Mission Police Lt. Jody Tittle told KVEO . \"Sometimes animal cruelty is hard to prove, you know, as bad as that may sound.\" \nThough the experience was an emotional one, Torrez is glad her recorded and reported Cardona. \n\"When I found out he was arrested not even 24 hours later, I felt relieved and when I found out later all his dogs and been removed I felt a sense of accomplishment knowing that I helped save these dogs from a monster,\" Torrez told Chron.com. \"My intent was never to go viral I was just trying to bring awareness to animal abuse.\" \nThe dog, a German Shepard mix named G2, was cleared by Mission Animal Control and is said to be in good health and remains in their custody, according to KGBT .
