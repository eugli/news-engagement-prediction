The four men (who have fled the country) put the liquid on the hands of both women before they acted. \n“The Indonesian was the first to wipe her hands on the victim’s face, followed by the Vietnamese,” he told a press conference yesterday, dismissing reports that the women had worn gloves and earlier claims that the two had thought it was all part of a prank on Jong-nam. \nIt could be seen on the CCTV footage that the women went to a nearby restroom shortly after carrying out the hit on Jong-nam, said Khalid. \n“They were also instructed to wash their hands after the attack. \n“They even practised a few times at Pavilion and KLCC prior to the incident,” he said. \nFour people have so far been arrested in relation to the case. \nApart from Doan, who arrived from Hanoi on Feb 4, and spa masseuse Siti Aisyah, who entered the country via Batam on Feb 2, North Korean Ri Jong-chol, 47 was also arrested. Detained last Friday, the chemist had entered Malaysia on Aug 6 last year. \nAlso held is Siti Aisyah’s boyfriend, Malaysian Muhammad Farid Jalaluddin. \nHe was arrested on Feb 15 but is not a main suspect in the case. \nKhalid said the remand for the two women was extended for a further seven days while the boyfriend would be released on police bail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:51:06.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
