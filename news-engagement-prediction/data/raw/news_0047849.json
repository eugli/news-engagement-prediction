(Sushil Kumar/HT PHOTO) \nDelhi Metro has decided to introduce multi-modal integration (MMI) in 68 of its upcoming stations under Phase III instead of the initially proposed 14 Metro stations. \nThe Delhi metro has guaranteed that almost 90% of its stations coming up under the Phase III project are going to “chaos free” zones. The mass transporter is going to develop areas within 300 metre radius of such MMI stations offering dedicated spaces for pedestrians, motorised and non-motorised vehicles. \n“Around 68 out of the 78 stations in Phase 3 are going to have seamless connectivity with IPT (intermediate para transit) system and buses. So far, 61 station designs for the same have been approved by the Lieutenant Governor (L-G),” said Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC. \nRead more| Pink, blue, yellow, all taken: Delhi Metro running out of colours for new lines \nSpecial emphasis is also being given in making areas around stations greener. “Sitting areas will be created around trees. People will get to see a lot of hedges, manicured in interesting shapes at some stations. Food kiosks will be stationed near these seating spaces,” Dayal said. \nAt Moolchand station, for example, a mini amphitheatre like space will be created for sitting, which would be located near a food plaza. While work on two stations, Kashmere Gate and Chhatarpur have begun, construction at 12 others — like Dilshad Garden, Shahadara ,Shastri Nagar, Rohini West, Jahangirpuri, New Delhi, AIIMS, Dwarka Mod, Uttam Nagar East, Karol Bagh, Jhandelwalan, Moolchand and Nehru Place — will start soon. \nRead more| In Phase IV, Delhi Metro will go deeper under narrow lanes of Old Delhi \nAt present, areas around a number of metro stations are chaotic and unsafe with hawkers, beggars, e-rickshaws, autos and cycle rickshaws using up space haphazardly. While auto drivers continue to parking norms in the bays dedicated for them, there is no planned space for non-motorised vehicles. \nMoreover, three-wheelers crowd areas outside stations to such an extent that bus stops have been pushed away from the stations. With the number of cabs rapidly multiplying in the city, a lot of space is also being eaten up by cars, where drivers wait for passengers. \nRead more| Rapid Metro slow on ridership \nUnder the MMI system, the DMRC is going to create pedestrian zones around stations for easy and safe dispersion of commuters towards the bus stop, lanes for non-motorised vehicles lanes, auto TSRs and cycle stands. \n“There will be dedicated bays for autos, e-rickshaws and feeder buses. Public facilities like toilets, dustbins, hawking zones, lighting, signages, information/wayfinding maps, cycle repair shops, electric charging stations for electric rickshaws will also be provided,” Dayal said. \nIn addition, roads that directly fall under the station areas are being re-designed with special pedestrian crossing facilities and traffic calmers. “The crossing time for pedestrians will be shortened and traffic calming measures will be taken through synchronised traffic signals,” he added.
