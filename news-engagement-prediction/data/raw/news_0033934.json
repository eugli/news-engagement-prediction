But this time, we have given the work to a competent company like Setraco. This road is important to us because of Ariaria International Market. \n“Setraco will do a 5.6 kilometres underground water channel that will take the storm water from Ifeobara Basin to Aba River. \nThis is a permanent solution to the problem of Ukwa-Mango and the flood water along Faulks Road. Those who built houses and other structures at Ifeobara basin should remove them or have the government demolish them.” \nWhen South East Voice visited the area, construction workers from the Setraco Company were on site building the channel to link the Ifeobara Basin. \nSome residents of the area who spoke to South East Voice commended the state government for the projects, stressing that if completed as designed, the problem of flooding on Faulks Road, Ukwu Mango and the Ariara International Market would be over, even as it was also observed that the state government had commenced efforts to expand the Ifeobara Basin by demolishing structures built around the area. \nEfforts to get the reaction of the Setraco Construction Company, proved abortive as some workers on site directed the South East Voice to the Manager, Mr. Charbel Eid, who could not be reached on the telephone at the time of filing this report.
