His lows included the 5-0 Ashes whitewash which precipitated a crisis in the Test team and the recent defeats on the sub-continent by India and Bangladesh. \nThe team drifted in 2016 and the emergence of Root and Ben Stokes, almost certain to be vice-captain, has shown the future direction England need to take. \nCook will now concentrate on opening the batting and leading with the bat and attempt to overhaul Sachin Tendulkar’s record for the most Test runs. Root is in line to replace Cook as captain with Ben Stokes second in command Credit: AP \nR oot has little captaincy experience beyond a handful of matches for Yorkshire but has been identified as a future England captain since the early days of his Test career.
