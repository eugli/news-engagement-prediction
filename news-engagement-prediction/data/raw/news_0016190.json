Key points Mr Kalanick said his participation was never meant to be an endorsement Social media campaigns urged users to switch to rival firm Lyft Inc. In a note to employees, Mr Kalanick said many communities hard been hurt by the ban \nThe CEO of the ride hailing service had been under mounting pressure from activists who oppose the administration's immigration policies. \nCritics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves. \n\"Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the President or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,\" Mr Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff. \nUber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later on Thursday confirmed he had left the group. \nSocial media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft. \nUber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban. \nMr Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Mr Trump about the immigration order \"and its issues for our community\" and told the President he would not join the economic council. \nThe CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Mr Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven majority-Muslim nations from entering the United States. \n\"There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that,\" he wrote in a note to employees. \n\"The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America. \n\"Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and there's a growing fear the US is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.\" \nThe White House said in a statement that did not mention Uber that Mr Trump \"understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation's economy stronger.\" Big tech firms oppose the immigration ban \nThe move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Mr Trump on Friday. \nGeneral Motors said its chief executive will attend, while Walt Disney said earlier on Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting. \nOthers expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM and Wal-Mart. \nOthers that are part of the council include Tesla Motors chief executive Elon Musk, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser. \nThe departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington. \n\"There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,\" said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. \n\"They [the Trump administration] clearly don't value the economic activity generated by tech.\" \nMicrosoft on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Mr Trump's travel limits. \nTechnology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Apple and Amazon.com have opposed Mr Trump's order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world. \nAmazon and Expedia have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state Attorney-General. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:29:46.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
