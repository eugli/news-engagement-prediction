The pictures were taken in 1960 in NYC when Marilyn was just 34 years old. The Daily Mail is reporting that Monroe was pregnant with French actor: Yves Montand . \nFrieda Hull became close to the star while part of a group of fans known as the Monroe Six. She named the photos \"the pregnant slides\" as a note to the secret kept right up until Monroe's death. A friend or Frieda's, Tony Michaels , bought the photos at a 'once in a lifetime' Marilyn Memorabilia Auction. Frieda had told Michaela that Monroe lost the baby, but it was never made clear whether that was by miscarriage or possibly an abortion! \nTake a look at the photo's below: A post shared by @caitlincahillx on Feb 15, 2017 at 11:45am PST A post shared by heldien (@br.heldien) on Feb 15, 2017 at 11:58am PST A post shared by heldien (@br.heldien) on Feb 15, 2017 at 11:59am PST ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T22:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T06:27:31.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
