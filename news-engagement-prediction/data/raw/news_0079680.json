Source: Facebook/Gurmehar Kaur \nDelhi University student Gurmehar Kaur who is also the daughter of a Kargil martyr filed a complaint with the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) against the ABVP threats. Gurmehar who received rape threats while addressing the media after filing the complaint said, “It doesn’t matter who you are or what organisation you belong to, you cannot threaten a woman with rape. This movement is not for anyone else and for women. There will be a protest march tomorrow, it will be a peaceful protest and it is because we don’t want any bullies in the country. The march will start at 12:30 PM at the Khalsa College.” Gurmehar has been in the news for the last couple of days for her stand against ABVP and their concept of nationalism. \nAfter Gurmehar’s complaint, Swati Maliwal, the DCW Chief said, “She has given us a complete list of names who have been threatening her on social media. We have sent the letter to Delhi Police and I have personally talked to the Commissioner of Delhi Police. All Gurmehar Kaur wants is peace in Universities and colleges, all across the country.” While talking about the rape threats she said, “Police must take action against those boys giving rape threats to Gurmehar Kaur and set an example.” \nWatch the video- ‘No one can threaten women, I will take a bullet for my country: Gurmehar Kaur, DU Student. pic.twitter.com/IGOg9rqL1b \n— News18 (@CNNnews18) February 27, 2017 \nEarlier in the day, Gurmehar Kaur, daughter of the Kargil martyr said that she doesn’t need to prove her nationalism. She came into controversy after posting pictures on the social media network. Union Minister Kiren Rijiju reacted in an interview to CNN news, and said Gurmehar Kaur is misguided. He reminds the DU youth that we are sharing the air of this country, we are drinking the water of this country and we must appreciate it. “Kargil war must not be exploited,” he says.
