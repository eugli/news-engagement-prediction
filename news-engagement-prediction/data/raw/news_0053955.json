The unofficial Disney Cruise Line Blog reminds us to bring coins to make pressed-penny souvenirs. Pressed pennies are a popular collectible in the Disney parks. While there are no machines on Disney's ships, there is a pressed-penny machine in the cruise terminal at Port Canaveral.\nThere are six Disney Cruise Line designs in all: one for each of the four Disney ships, one for Castaway Cay and one general Disney Cruise Line penny.\nYou'll need one penny and two quarters to create a pressed penny. Want the whole DCL collection? Bring 12 quarters and six pennies.\nFind this pin on my Disney Cruise Line with Kids board.\n23 of 25 Show All 1 Bring some Sharpies for the best DIY Disney souvenirs ever 2 Pack homemade costumes for theme nights 3 Arrive the night before 4 Book an early arrival 5 Personalize the outside of your stateroom door 6 Use magnets to turn your door into a command center 7 Snag a free ticket for a coveted meeting 8 Ask the ship's photographers to use your camera 9 Wear a wristwatch and set it to ship time 10 Change your phone's lock screen 11 Join the ultimate Disney gift swap at sea 12 Pack your carry-on for fun from Minute One 13 Outsmart those smart light switches 14 Multiply your outlets 15 Pack a dry bag for a day at the beach 16 Bring a few dollar bills to Castaway Cay 17 Booking an interior cabin?
