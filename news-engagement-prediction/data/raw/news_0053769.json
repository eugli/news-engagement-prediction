Journalism and journalists becoming its actors, more so in the theatre of the new media,\" Zahid said. \nHe said the media must be the intelligence dimension for global peace and harmony by facilitating a multicultural and a multi-civilizational dialogue, educate people and stir cultural and civilzational thinking. \n\"We do not need only dominant worldview. All worldviews perpetuated and projected by the media must be seen in equitable terms. Media and world harmony are not premised on a monolithic worldview but alternative and pluralistic views must characterise this enterprise,\" he added. \nZahid said that the challenges for media for world harmony are tremendous, such as ideological, government repressions, national legislative and constitutional provisions or lack of them, cuts in commercial revenues and the tyranny of technology. \nHe said the media and world harmony are not only the story of states and government but the story of humanity and civilizations and their interactions to modern and contemporary life. \n\"The role of religion and spirituality in the media with the dialogue of civilizations is critical and we cannot leave out religion when speaking of media and world harmony. Without religion, there would not be world harmony and without media as agent, there would not be meaningful participant among us,\" he said. \nMore than 200 participants attended the two-day Ibraf's forum and meeting held in Kota Bandung, beginning today. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:45:55.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
