The Dunk Elite features a larger Zoom Air bag in the midsole, to give riders maximum impact absorption, and a one-piece upper that eliminates seams in high-wear areas. The launch colorway for the new Dunk Elite Low is modeled off the original grey and blue SB Dunk sample that Sandy Bodecker (then the GM of Nike SB) first took around to skate shops in 2002. The shoe is available March 9 on nike.com and at select retailers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:17:44.212+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
