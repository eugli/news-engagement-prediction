They're deep in this bit. \nHe also singled out the \"overrated\" Streep, whose anti-Trump Golden Globes speech launched a flood of tweets, by giving her a standing ovation. Kimmel got a bit more serious and asked Americans to \"reach out to one person you disagree with... and have a positive, considerate conversation\" to \"make America great again.\" \nAnd he asked us to remember last year's Oscars: \"I want to say thank you the President Trump. Remember last year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?\" \nKimmel's feud with Damon didn't end with the monologue, though. these #oscars are turning into a Matt Damon roast pic.twitter.com/xPszIXiZao â€” The Daily Dot (@dailydot) February 27, 2017 Jimmy Kimmel rips Matt Damon with fake 'We Bought a Zoo' tribute: \"He has almost no discernible talent.\" #Oscars pic.twitter.com/HpX8zh8l73 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:38:33.728+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
