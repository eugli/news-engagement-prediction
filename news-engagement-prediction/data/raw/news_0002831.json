If it involves overseas-based institutions of higher learning, the best way is to contact the authorities in that particular country,\" she said. \nSiti Hamisah was speaking to reporters after officiating the 2017 International Conference on Teaching and Learning in Higher Education (ICTLHE) at Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (UMT) near here Wednesday. \nAlso present were UMT vice-chancellor Prof Datuk Dr Nor Aieni Mokhtar, Universiti Sultan Zainal Abidin deputy vice-chancellor (Academic and International) Prof Dr Mahadzirah Mohamad and Open Learning Global Pte Ltd chief executive officer Adam Brimo. \nSiti Hamisah was commenting on a local daily report which exposed a syndicate offering bachelor's and post-graduate degrees including doctorates (PhD) between RM11,000 and RM15,000 within 24 hours after payments were made. - Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:43:09.407+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
