She says she can easily see herself balancing her work and family as women are masters at multi-tasking.\nKareena gave birth to her first child with actor Saif Ali Khan in December. \nAsked how she plans to balance work and motherhood, Kareena said: \"I have always balanced my work and my marriage. People thought that I wouldn't, and I did. I am going to continue to do that. I think women know how to multi-task. \n\"Today, you see working women out there. If you have a family, if you have a child... It doesn't mean you are home-bound. Of course, there is time for that and work.\" \nThe 36-year-old actress, who maintained her style quotient during the nine months that she carried Taimur and continued to be active at endorsement-related events and social gatherings, is loving this phase of her life. \n\"I am taking it each day as it comes. I think it's the most beautiful phase of my life,\" said Kareena. \nHaving said that, she agrees \"parenthood comes with a lot of responsibility\". \"Both Saif and me are ready for this kind of responsibility,\" she added. \nImages: Sify", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:34:03.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
