The model will live alongside the larger 5.5-inch iPhone and the smaller 4.7-inch variant. \nThe report also notes that only the top-tier iPhone with an all-glass design will feature wireless charging. Every other report and rumour so far has noted that Apple will include wireless charging on all three variants of the iPhone due to be unveiled this year. \nAdditionally, the report states that Apple will make use of Qi wireless charging standard on the iPhone instead of a long-range one from Energous . The Cupertino company will also not include the wireless charger in the box, with consumers having to purchase it separately. Going a step further, the company will reportedly stop including the Lightning to 3.5mm adapter with the iPhone 8 this year. With many Lightning earphones and AirPods now available in the market, Apple was bound to make this move sooner or later. \nThis is not the first time that we have heard about Apple launching a 5-inch iPhone, but looking at how today’s report goes against many of the previous rumours and leaks, I’d say that the chances of it turning out to be accurate are pretty slim.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T22:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T18:54:06.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
