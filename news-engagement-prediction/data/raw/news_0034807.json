For example, a consumer searching for ‘Download movie XYZ’ will no longer be directed to torrent sites from where the pirated copy of said movie can be accessed. \nWhile the move may prevent some people from accessing pirated content, savvy users will easily be able to circumvent it. \nHere are five ways how the torrent sites will still be accessible to users: \nThrough other search engines \nMost pirates are likely to move from the traditional search engines like Google and Bing to privacy-focussed ones like DuckDuckGo and Ixquick. Sites such as DuckDuckGo emphasize on protecting searchers’ privacy and avoiding the filtered search results. This means no website, including torrent sites, will be filtered out from search results. \nDirectly accessing torrent sites \nPopular torrents sites maintain their own internal search engine for pirated content. Users can go around the ban by simply visiting popular torrent sites directly and searching for the content they need. The most popular public torrent platforms offer very sophisticated search engines that allow users to filter results by popularity. \nPrivate trackers \nWhile public torrent trackers (platforms) are popular with most users, private trackers offer a significant upgrade. They’re called “private” because they regulate who is allowed to use the site or in other words they are an exclusive community. \nBecause the rules are so strict and the sites are so much less visited than sites such as The Pirate Bay, users are a lot less likely to have someone looking over their shoulder. So, the search engine ban hammer is unlikely to affect access to these sites because of their relative obscurity. \nIllegal streaming sites \nTorrenting is so 2003 and illegal streaming sites are the new king, at least that is what the data says. A large majority of traffic for both TV and film piracy is now being hogged by streaming piracy sites instead of torrent-based downloading, with roughly 58 billion visits last year alone according to research group Muso . \n“There’s a clear piracy audience trend change away from content ‘ownership’ using P2P/Torrents or web downloads,” the company reported. \nJust how large is that? According to Muso, streaming volume accounts for approximately 74% of all TV and movie piracy online, with traffic to torrent sites dropping sharply. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:32:55.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
