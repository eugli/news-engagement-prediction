I just feel blessed to have had the opportunities that I have had.\" \nAs for the on-stage mix-up for \"Moonlight,\" Ali has a lot of respect for the musical that almost stole their light. \"'La La Land' has done so well and resonated with so many people, especially in this time when people need a sense of buoyancy in their life and need some hope and light. That film has really affected people in a very different way than 'Moonlight.'\" \n\"When their name was read, I wasn't surprised. I was really happy for them,\" he said. \"Then, when I saw security and people coming onstage and their moment was being disrupted, I got really worried. When they said 'Moonlight' had won, it threw me a bit. Well... it threw me more than a bit. I didn’t want to go up there and take it from somebody. It’s very hard to feel joy in a moment like that.\" \nHowever, in the end Ali can see the silver lining, \"I feel very fortunate for us all to have walked away with best picture. It's pretty remarkable.\" \nAs for landing his Oscar-winning character from \"Moonlight\" Juan, Ali jokes, “I’m glad Idris [Elba] and David Oyelowo left me a job.” Latest updates", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T09:52:40.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
