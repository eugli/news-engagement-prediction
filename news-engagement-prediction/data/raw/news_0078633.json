The dad-of-four kicked off Pancake Day by sharing a video of himself expertly flipping a pancake in the air. \"Happy Pancake Day, kids. Ready?\" David was heard saying. His daughter Harper , five, enthusiastically replied \"Yeah!\" as she watched her dad show off his culinary skills at home. The sweet Instagram video gave fans a glimpse inside the Beckhams' kitchen, and more importantly, their pancake toppings of choice. David and his little girl seem to have opted for the classic lemon and Nutella toppings, judging by the short clip. \nPancake Day: the best menus to try \nThe father-daughter duo are incredibly close, with David regularly taking to social media to share photos and videos of his youngest child. David, his wife Victoria and the couple's four children – Brooklyn , Romeo, Cruz and Harper – have recently returned from a skiing trip in Canada , where David learnt how to snowboard. It was his first time on the slopes, as David wasn't allowed to do any winter sports while playing professional football. A post shared by David Beckham (@davidbeckham) on Feb 28, 2017 at 2:47am PST \nGBBO's Selasi shares his top tips for Pancake Day! \nThe sports icon, who captained the England football team in his prime, looked a natural as he posted a video of himself doing tricks on his snowboard. Unluckily for David, the dad-of-four took a tumble and broke his front tooth in an accident . He headed to an emergency dentist within hours of landing back in London, and had his incisor fixed, the Sun reports. A source said: \"David is a trooper and didn't make a fuss. He took it all in his stride.\" His eldest son Brooklyn, 17, also lost his balance while snowboarding and broke his collarbone . \nDuring the holiday, David seemed particularly proud of his little girl Harper as he shared a few photos of his daughter. \"Daddy is chasing you,\" he wrote alongside a photo of himself snowboarding behind Harper. In another sweet snap, the stylish schoolgirl was the picture of cuteness as she expertly snowploughed down the slopes in an all-white outfit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:58:43.798+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
