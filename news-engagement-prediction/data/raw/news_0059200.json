Using drones and fighter jets, they have been working their way through a ‘kill list’ of key targets. Neither Parliament nor public has been informed. Islamic State fighter waving a flag while standing on captured government fighter jet in Raqqa An RAF Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle believed to have been used to kill two British jihadis David Cameron caused a furore when he revealed in September 2015 that the UK had used military force in Syria without the approval of MPs. Three British fanatics were killed in drone strikes. No further deaths have been announced since then – apparently on the basis that the Government later won parliamentary backing for its Syrian operations. The Ministry of Defence also said hits were hard to verify and it did not want to make martyrs out of terrorists. ‘When we know where they are we kill them,’ said a senior defence source. ‘Our priority is those plotting against the UK. David Cameron caused a furore when he revealed in September 2015 that the UK had used military force in Syria without the approval of MPs 'We have found evidence of this. We are also helping the French who don’t have our capabilities.’ The British pilots are operating the drones from a hangar at RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire, 3,000 miles from Syria. In a statement, the MoD said: ‘We and our coalition partners have been clear that if you are fighting for Daesh (Islamic State) in Iraq and Syria then you will be targeted, irrespective of nationality. 'The UK is committed to the defeat of Daesh and publishes regular updates on air strikes conducted by the RAF.’ UK intelligence agencies are helping to find other British jihadists, who expose their locations when they use their mobile phones. RAF jets and drones can then target them using laser-guided missiles and 500lb bombs. The defence source said ‘UK voices’ had been picked up in the trenches in Syria as troops closed in on Islamic State’s stronghold of Raqqa. However, the disclosure that UK forces have continued to take out British jihadists abroad without any public announcement is controversial. Mr Cameron stunned MPs 18 months ago with news of the assassination in Syria of a jihadist plotting an atrocity at an event attended by the Queen. Reyaad Khan, 21 and from Cardiff, was killed along with another British fanatic, Ruhul Amin, on August 21, 2015. A third jihadist, Junaid Hussain from Birmingham, was killed by a US drone in a joint operation three days later. Mr Cameron said Khan was a ‘clear and present danger’ but the Government was accused of executing a secret ‘kill policy’ and critics demanded a judicial review. Shortly afterwards, Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said Britain would not hesitate to carry out more drone strikes against jihadists plotting ‘armed attacks on our streets’.
