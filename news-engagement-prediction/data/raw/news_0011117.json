Dan Sweeney has got to go,\" a crowd of more than 1,000 protesters began marching from Trump Plaza Saturday evening. Their final destination? The Intracoastal Waterway just west of Mar-a-Lago, where President Trump arrived Friday for his first visit to his Palm Beach estate since being sworn in as the nation's 45th president.\nThe signs they carried were as varied as the controversies that have plagued the first days of the Trump administration. \n\"Climate Change Is Real,\" read one. \n\"I stand with my Muslim neighbors,\" read another. \n\"My Body My Choice,\" a third declared. \nOne sign listed a half-dozen issues before ending, \"#GonnaNeedABiggerSign.\" \nA flag-draped coffin preceded the protesters along the water next to Olive Street in downtown West Palm Beach, but progress was slow as the throng attempted to navigate the walkway. \nProtesters rally at LAX \nBefore the walk kicked off at 5 p.m., police estimated the crowd at 1,000 people, but it soon swelled considerably beyond that. \nThe idea for the march started with a local activist named Stephen Milo, who envisioned a few hundred people peacefully marching from Trump Plaza to Mar-a-Lago. But more than 2,000 people said they would attend when he posted the event on Facebook, and he canceled, citing security concerns. \nBut thousands had already planned to march to Mar-a-Lago, and they were not about to let a little thing like the march being canceled stand in their way. Instead, organizers of the local chapter of the Women's March, which took place the day after Inauguration Day in Washington, D.C., and other cities around the world, took up the torch. \nOn their separate Facebook page, which was created Thursday, 1,600 people said they would attend. \n\"The other gentleman who set it up had noble intentions, but I don't think he realized how big it would get,\" said Luis Garcia, a retired firefighter who was participating in the march as a volunteer marshal, keeping everyone peaceful and on the sidewalks. \nGarcia said he was also bringing first aid equipment, granola bars and \"two backpacks filled with frozen water\" to give out to the sweaty masses. \"My main goal is to directly communicate with police commanders on scene,\" Garcia said, in order to report violent agitators or medical emergencies. \nThe initial plan had called for protesters to march directly to Mar-a-Lago, where the International Red Cross was having its charity gala, complete with a fireworks display. But after taking over the event, the Women's March Florida shortened the march to end at the Intracoastal before crossing over into the City of Palm Beach. Because of the president's presence and the Red Cross event, security concerns prevented anything more. The Secret Service barred all traffic into south Palm Beach except for hotel guests and residents. \nThe protests have drawn unwelcome attention to the Red Cross ball. The organization works a great deal with refugees, so Trump's ban on refugees had some calling for the Red Cross to nix the event. But that would have meant losing thousands of dollars, both money raised at the gala and in nonrefundable fees paid to Mar-a-Lago. \nAccording to the Associated Press, a permit for the Red Cross' 2016 gala says 500 people were expected to attend and the event would raise $925,000 and cost about $400,000 to put on. \n, 954-356-4605 or Twitter @Daniel_Sweeney", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:03:47.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
