A New Hope [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nHamster Hashtags is a trend started by fans of Mark Hamill (\"Hamster\"), as an ode to his social media prowess. A photo of Hamill is uploaded to the Twitter account @HamsterHashtags , and Hamill's fans compete to come up with the best caption in hashtag form. The account and competition is fan-run, and inspired by Hamill's own hilarious hashtagging. \nHamill has been invited to engage in the competition before, and it looks like he's finally taken up the challenge: @HamillHimself @joanwalsh @esquire Great hashtags as always Mark, I hope one day to see them in a round of #HamsterHashtags ! — Hamster Hashtags (@HamsterHashtags) November 11, 2016 \nSuffice to say Hamill probably won this round of the competition. Though to be fair, he should probably be excluded from competing— his hashtag skills are just too next-level. 2017: The Year Of Mark Hamill's Oscar-Worthy Monologue? The Force Awakens [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nThe Force Awakens was nominated for a handful of Academy Awards upon release, but the stars themselves were snubbed— and that includes Hamill. It's hardly surprising, considering his very short appearance. That prolonged moment of eye contact may have triggered some serious emotions for Star Wars fans, but it wasn't exactly \"Oscar-worthy\". \nHowever, there's new hope for Hamill in the form of his next Star Wars escapade, #TheLastJedi . While Star Wars has snagged a few Academy Awards in the past for production, the narrative and acting isn't quite what you'd expect to see recognized by the Oscars. \nThen again, perhaps Hamill has plans to change all that— could his cheeky tweet be a hint at what's to come? Poll Do you think Mark Hamill will deliver an Oscar-worthy monologue in 'The Last Jedi'? I'm sure his monologue will be great, but it won't win him an Oscar. Yes! And I can't wait! The Academy Awards is for serious grown-up thespians, not hashtagging old Jedi. \n[Image credit: Lucasfilm] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:19:22.982+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
