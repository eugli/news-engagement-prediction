Hom credits his subjects' willingness to strip down and otherwise bare their souls to the trust they place in him. 'You can't take a great photograph if people don't trust you. If you don't have the common respect for each other, it's like knocking your head on a wall,' he said. One of his favorites from the book is a whole of actress Sienna Miller, who is seen sitting in a car. He said the image has a 'cinematic feeling', and Sienna herself was a great subject. He added that you can't take a great photo if your subject doesn't trust you (pictured: Alicia Vikander) He also photographed Mickey Rourke (pictured), Lupita Nyong'o, Robert Redford, Angelina Jolie, Christopher Walken, Brie Larson, Kate Winslet, and Michelle Obama. This image of Louise Bourgeois in New York City in 1996 is one of his favorites 'She's one of those people who just gave it all she had really. I don't know if I should repeat this, but as she was sitting in the car, she said \"Hold on, one second!\" She lifted up the shirt and touched her nipples to get them erect, and was like \"Okay, I'm ready now!\" I thought that was quite funny. It's definitely stuck in my mind!' In another image, Jennifer Lopez wraps herself in a blanket on the floor. Rachel McAdams looks sexy and undone in a slip dress and leather jacket, while Nicole Kidman hangs out barefoot on the steps of her trailer. Alicia Vikander, Louise Bourgeois, David Beckham, Lupita Nyong'o, Robert Redford, Angelina Jolie, Christopher Walken, Brie Larson, Kate Winslet, Julian Schnabel, Wiz Khalifa, Iggy Pop, Matthew McConaughey, Ben Affleck, and Michelle Obama. Hom, who is originally from Denmark, has also photographed the Danish royal family. The images will be showcased at the 'Profiles' exhibition. They will be on display from May 8, 2017 at the IMMAGIS Gallery in Munich, Germany.
