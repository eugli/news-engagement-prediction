Tune into Kylie's Snapchat right now!\nA post shared by Kylie Cosmetics (@kyliecosmetics) on Feb 22, 2017 at 10:30am PST\n There are six shades in the Kylighter collection: Banana Split, French Vanilla, Salted Caramel (Jenner's favorite), Cotton Candy (Jenner's other favorite), Chocolate Cherry, and Strawberry Cheesecake. Each shade looks insanely glitteryâ€“basically, these are not highlighters for the shine-adverse. Though she noted that you can wear whatever shade you want, the range of six means you can find one to work on all skin tonesâ€”from fair to deep.", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ0vF0GF1qO/"], "published": "2017-02-23T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:22:52.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
