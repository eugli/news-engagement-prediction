We followed the mayor,” he said. “We followed him to his favorite coffee haunt in Brooklyn. We went to his gym, the YMCA in Park Slope, to get him to focus on the contract. And I think it was effective.” \nTensions ran high during negotiations over the last several months, with the PBA launching attacks and tailing Hizzoner. \nLynch often led protests outside the mayor’s gym and favorite coffee shop to put the pressure on.
