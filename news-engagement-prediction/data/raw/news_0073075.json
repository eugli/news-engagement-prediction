SEE MORE: Awards: The Contenders \nIt was announced earlier this year that, because of President Donald Trump ’s travel ban, Farhadi would boycott the Academy Awards , even if exceptions were made to allow him entry into the United States. Another prominent Iranian American, engineer Anousheh Ansari, accepted the prize for him and read a prepared statement on stage. \n“I’m sorry I’m not with you tonight,” she read. “My absence is out of respect for the people of my country and those of other six nations whom have been disrespected by the inhumane law that bans entry of immigrants to the U.S.” Related Academy Award Winners 2017: Updated List \n“Dividing the world into the us and our enemies categories creates fear,” she continued. “A deceitful justification for aggression and war.

As he noted in the statement, Farhadi in 2012 won the best foreign-language film award for “A Separation.” Filed Under: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T10:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:19:19.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
