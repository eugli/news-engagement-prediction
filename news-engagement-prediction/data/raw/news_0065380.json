As long as your not a Muslim”. \nIt wasn’t long before people were pointing out that “your” should have been “you’re”. Oops. Grammatical error leaves anti-Muslim sign open to ridicule. Source: Facebook \n“Proper English or leave!” one person posted in response. \nAnother said: “I’d rather communicate with a Muslim than most Australians who forgot how to speak English”. \nFacebook user Susan Husseini took the original photo with the comment “Are these people serious”. \nOne commenter hit back with: “I don’t care if you’re Muslim, as long as you can SPELL.” \nAnother suggested it was typical of haters. \n“Not the brightest of stars either, with the spelling error. That is often so obvious. Those full of hatred are not bright people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:17:23.849+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
