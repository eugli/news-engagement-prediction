But that is slowly beginning to change.In October 2008, director David Zucker, famous for his Airplane and Naked Gun movies, released An American Carol , a film that spoofs Hollywood liberalism and its most notorious propaganda artist, Michael Moore . The film starred a host of Hollywood conservatives, who 10 or 15 years ago would have lost their careers for such political blasphemy!But it isn't the film's plot that makes it such an important piece of cinema. It's what the film says about the conservative movement. By coming out with a clearly right-of-center film -- a comedy, no less -- Hollywood conservatives are saying they're willing to put their careers on the line to help the movement move into the light of day.Below is a list of Tinseltown celebs who make no bones about their conservative commitments. The list is growing, and each week one of these Hollywood celebrities will be profiled -- complete with a breakdown of their conservative credentials. Some you'll know. Others might surprise you. Either way, enjoy ... and know that if you're a conservative, you're not alone (even though it might feel like it sometimes)!
