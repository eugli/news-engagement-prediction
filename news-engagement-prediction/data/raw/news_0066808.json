(ABC News: Jane Bardon) \nLast week, Julalikari said in a public notice that it had fenced off and signed the affected areas and the corporation was hiring an asbestos removal company, security to patrol the areas and an interpreter to speak to families about the dangers of asbestos. \nMs Turner said Julalikari had also failed to deliver housing services in the region. \n\"There's a 10-year waiting list to get into public housing and even a four-year waiting list to get on priority housing,\" she said. \n\"We have people living in the bush, in parks, it's really sad.\" \nMr Dodd said his business, a petrol station in Tennant Creek, had been in Julalikari's firing line. \n\"They've taken business off their own business, which is a ludicrous situation,\" he said. \n\"We're 50 per cent owned by Julalikari and they decided, without any reason that was given to us, to pull overnight their whole trade off us.\" \nJulalikari was set up in 1989 to improve the lives of Aboriginal people in the Barkly region and it now employs more than 90 people, according to ORIC. \nMr Beven said the corporation was solvent and in a strong financial position but the loss of community support had created problems for its governance and operations. \n\"There is frustration on all sides,\" he said. \n\"The special administrators will provide an opportunity for all parties to restart conversations in good faith, restructure the corporation's governance, and refocus its energy on delivering high-quality services.\" \nIn a statement to the ABC, Julalikari said it was disappointed with the registrar's decision, especially given its financial position. \n\"ORIC appears to have given weight to criticism - most of it anonymous - levelled at JCAC by a small but vocal number of critics, some of whom are non-Aboriginal people who are significantly indebted to JCAC,\" the statement read. \nThe organisation said it was planning to meet to discuss the decision and said a request for a review was one of the options being considered.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:47:35.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
