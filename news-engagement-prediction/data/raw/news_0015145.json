Their first foray into North County is scheduled to open early next week and is the second edition of The Crack Shack , the group’s fast-casual phenomenon built around fried chicken and egg-centric dishes. Nestled into a busy Encinitas corner, the 6,000-square-foot restaurant isn’t quite as open-air as its Little Italy predecessor, but the indoor/outdoor space is appealingly breezy and the retractable roof ensures comfortable year-round dining. Bluemotif Architecture returns with its signature design elements, including communal tables. the bocce ball court (that can also be used for cornhole and mini-golf) and, of course, the oversized chicken statue. New elements include a chicken-themed American Gothic mural, a kid-friendly sandbox and chalkboard wall, an outdoor fire pit, and a semi-private room with a fireplace and multiple large screen TVs. Running the kitchen is chef Andrew Schrader , where the menu is still anchored by its top-notch fried chicken and chicken-based sandwiches; more recent additions include a refreshed kale salad and the mash-up of matzo ball soup and pozole. Also new is a tap system featuring The Crack Shack’s signature sauces, an espresso bar powered by Bird Rock Coffee Roasters, and a separate walk-up window that will expedite to-go orders. The fast-casual eatery also features a full bar, with a craft cocktail program created by bar manager Eric Johnson and 32 taps of local craft beer and wine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:23:47.088+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
