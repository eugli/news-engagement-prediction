the Titans close in on a forgotten forward; and the rookies to debut in round one. \nCheck out Monday’s news bites from Fox Sports’ chief NRL reporter James Hooper. \nHolmes to miss round one \nPREMIERS Cronulla have been dealt an early curve ball with newly-anointed fullback Valentine Holmes racing the clock to be fit for the season-opener against Brisbane on Thursday night. \nThe young gun earmarked to replace Ben Barba after his departure to French rugby, Holmes is still struggling with a hamstring injury picked up in the trials and has been unable to train fully for the past fortnight. \nFor all the latest NRL news, tune into NRL Tonight LIVE on Fox Sports News 500, 5.30pm (AEDT) tonight! \nWith the Kangaroos flyer from last year’s Four Nations tour expected to be ruled out, Gerard Beale and Jack Bird have both trained at fullback for Cronulla. \nNew recruit Edrick Lee is expected to win one wing position when coach Shane Flanagan names his team on Tuesday, with Sosaia Feki also expected to overcome a knee injury and win selection. Jack Bird is in line to play fullback in round one.   \nBennett goes with bolter \nFIVE years ago, Tautau Moga was drawing comparisons to a young Israel Folau. \nBut three ACL reconstructions have rendered the talented centre as one of the NRL’s unluckiest players. \nThrown a lifeline by Wayne Bennett at the Brisbane Broncos last October, Moga is now firming to debut for the club at left centre against premiers Cronulla. \nMoga is tipped to be paired with Corey Oates on the left edge, with James Roberts and Jordan Kahu to be named on Brisbane’s right side. \nThe Broncos will arrive in Sydney on Wednesday. Tautau Moga looks set to be picked at left centre for the Broncos. Source: AAP \nThe rookies set to debut \nLAST year it was Ash Taylor, Nathan Cleary, Suliasi Vunivalu and Cody Walker who took a blowtorch to the NRL with breakout rookie seasons. \nThis year another talented crop of debutants are set to be given a crack at the big time in round one. \nFirst-up premiers Cronulla will name local junior Jayden Brailey to replace the retired Michael Ennis at hooker. \nThen on Friday night Wests Tigers coach Jason Taylor will name the million-dollar baby, Moses Suli, on the left wing. \nThis is the 18-year-old who signed a three-year $1.3 million contract without having played an NRL match. \nSuper Saturday will see the Canberra Raiders hand local young gun Nick Cotric a crack on the left wing. Cotric has been tipped to be equally as good as Raiders juniors Josh Dugan and Todd Carney. \nThe Newcastle Knights will also name another debutant, with the son of former coach Rick Stone, Sam Stone, tipped to win a spot on the bench for the Knights. Nick Cotric will make his Raiders debut in round one.   \nTitans close in on Grevsmuhl \nIN November last year it took a very frank appraisal from Penrith boss Phil Gould for Chris Grevsmuhl to realise he needed some time away from rugby league. \nAnd last week The Daily Telegraph told the brilliant story of how he is back in the NSW country town of Orange working on a building site and aiming to rekindle his love for rugby league. \nOne man who has been working behind the scenes to try and convince Grevsmuhl to return to the game is Gold Coast Titans coach Neil Henry. \nGrevsmuhl and Henry have a history dating back to when both were at the North Queensland Cowboys, with the Gold Coast now appearing a good chance of signing the forgotten forward. \nThe NRL is monitoring the situation and if the Titans can strike a deal, expect the Indigenous All Stars forward to be Gold Coast-bound by round four. Former Panthers player Chris Grevsmuhl could return to the NRL with the Titans.
