Clinton implored Trump (via his preferred medium, Twitter) to condemn the wave of attacks on the Jewish community in recent weeks, from at least 11 Jewish community centers across the U.S. that received bomb threats (which thankfully turned out to be hoaxes) to tombstones being overturned at a cemetery in the St. Louis area . “JCC threats, cemetery desecration & online attacks are so troubling & they need to be stopped. Everyone must speak out, starting w/ @POTUS,” Clinton tweeted, in what was perhaps her most pointed address to the president since he took office. Later this morning, after touring the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington D.C., the president appeared to listen to Clinton, as well as the growing chorus of others who have been calling on him to definitively condemn the anti-Semitic attacks. (There is a distinct and troubling irony, many have pointed out, that Trump’s comments flow freely about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s The Celebrity Apprentice ratings or his own electoral college victory, but he seems to be far less quick to renounce anti-Semitism and other hate crimes.) “Anti-Semitism is horrible, and it’s gonna stop and it has to stop,” Trump told NBC News . If Trump was indeed nudged by Clinton, even subconsciously, it would be a poignant moment for the president, who continues to criticize the former secretary of state even after her defeat (and her escape from the public eye)—perhaps most recently and nonsensically invoking her just last week as multiple reports exposed his campaign and administration’s ties to Russia (“This . . . is merely an attempt to cover up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton’s losing campaign,” the president deflected). It may also be a sign of the most effective means of reaching him: Forget Fox News; could the best way to impact the president come in 140 characters?
