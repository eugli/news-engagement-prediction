The Labour politician was first elected as Manchester Ardwick MP in 1970 before becoming Manchester Gorton MP after constituency boundary changes in 1983 until his death. \nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to Kaufman as an “iconic and irascible figure”, saying: “He loved life and politics. I will deeply miss him, both for his political commitment and constant friendship.” \nKaufman’s family said: “Sir Gerald had been suffering from a long-term illness for several months, but, in that time, remained firmly committed to, and focused on, the activities and wellbeing of his beloved constituency, which he had served since first elected in 1970. \n“Sir Gerald dedicated his life to serving those who he believed would benefit most from a Labour government and Labour values in action. He believed that policy and principle without power were simply not enough to deliver the better life that he fought for on behalf of his constituents for almost 50 years. \n“Though Sir Gerald had many friends and supporters in Manchester and across the world from his work on many campaigns and causes, he was in essence a private man. There will be a further opportunity for those who wish to pay tribute to the contribution of this great socialist and parliamentarian in due course. \n“For now, his family request that his dignity and integrity be honoured through respectful reflection.” \nMore details soon ...
