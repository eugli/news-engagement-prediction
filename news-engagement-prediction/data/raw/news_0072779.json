She was also a solo mother of one. The following four years were spent fighting the disease. She's now a personal trainer with a positive story to pass on to others. \nFour years ago Elouise Hemming was told to say goodbye to her baby daughter because she only had weeks to live. \nThe Auckland woman's lymphoma had returned after a year in remission; \"stage four cancer, again, and it was in my stomach, in my bladder, in my colon, in my rectum,\" she said. \nNow the 28-year-old is a competitive powerlifter and self-described life of the party. LAWRENCE SMITH \nTwenty-eight-year-old Hemming has two years left in remission before being declared cured of lymphoma. \nWhen her doctor told her death was nigh, Hemming replied \"f... that!\" \nREAD MORE: \n\"I said that because that's me, I fight, and that's what I did.\" LAWRENCE SMITH \nMother-of-one Elouise Hemming beat cancer twice to became a powerlifting personal trainer. \nShe battled her disease and the strain of motherhood within a disintegrating relationship. When the relationship and her chemotherapy ended together, Hemming turned to the gym for direction. \nShe said cancer taught her to see exercise as a privilege. \n\"Working out is uncomfortable, but that aspect gets you tougher mentally,\" she said. \"It's helped me become a better mum and friend.\" LAWRENCE SMITH \nMother-of-one Elouise Hemming beat cancer twice to became a powerlifting personal trainer. \nIt also gave her a career - Hemming became a personal trainer one year after going into remission. Ad Feedback \n\"I get a lot of joy from seeing people get stronger,\" she explained. \n\"I'm not interested in the aesthetic side of things, I'm interested in making a long term improvement - helping someone avoid old age in a nursing home, for example.\" \nShe is cautious about sharing her story with clients, wary some may perceive her as \"guilt tripping\". \n\"I don't want to be like 'look at me, there are no excuses' ... It's about inserting my experience somehow when they're finding motivation hard,\" she said. \nThe gym-junkie has also taken up powerlifting. \nDespite nausea, fluid retention, and heart problems that haunt her post-cancer body, Hemming can dead-lift 120kg. \nShe competed for the first time two months ago and aims to enter the Auckland Powerlifting Championships next year. \nAlong with her rallying health, her housing situation has improved since she was re-revaged by cancer. \nHemming left a mouldy apartment for a \"way better\" flat shared with another single mum. \n\"We take the 'it takes a village to raise a child' saying to heart,\" she said. \nMotherhood, powerlifting, work, and \"partying enough to make up for all those sick years\" keeps her occupied - but doctors' aren't out of Hemming's life yet. \nEvery few weeks for the next two years she needs blood tests to check she's still in remission. \nAsked whether she feared a third bout of cancer, Hemming gave a firm \"no\". \n\"I prefer to practice gratitude.\" - Sunday Star Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:30:05.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
