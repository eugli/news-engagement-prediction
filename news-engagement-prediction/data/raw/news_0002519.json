Photograph: Niall Carson/PA   Press Association   15.12 GMT \nFootballer Anthony Stokes has been given a two-year suspended sentence for assaulting an Elvis impersonator in a nightclub. \nThe Blackburn Rovers striker pleaded guilty last November over the attack in what was then Buck Whaleys on Leeson Street in Dublin on 8 June, 2013. \nThe 28-year-old, originally from Dublin and who spent six years playing for Celtic, is also to pay the victim, Anthony Bradley, €30,000. \nJudge Patricia Ryan said she was taking into consideration “the seriousness of the offence and the personal circumstances” of Stokes. \nDublin’s circuit criminal court heard that Bradley, 53, suffered a broken nose and two broken teeth in the incident. He has also been diagnosed with a degenerative spinal condition since the assault, which causes pain across his neck and shoulders. \nJudge Ryan also ordered Stokes to sign a bond to be on good behaviour for two years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T17:19:38.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
