Organic Versus Inorganic Benzene is an example of an organic compound. Benzene is made of carbon atoms bonded to other carbon atoms and to hydrogen atoms. Laguna Design / Getty Images Updated September 29, 2016 . Question: What Is the Difference Between Organic and Inorganic? \nOrganic compounds and inorganic compounds form the basis for chemistry. Here is a look at the difference between organic and inorganic compounds, plus examples of each type. \nAnswer: The primary difference between organic compounds and inorganic compounds is that organic compounds always contain carbon while most inorganic compounds do not contain carbon. Also, almost all organic compounds contain carbon-hydrogen or C-H bonds. Note, containing carbon is not sufficient for a compound to be considered organic! Examples of Organic Compounds or Molecules \nMolecules associated with living organisms are organic. These include nucleic acids, fats, sugars, proteins, enzymes and hydrocarbon fuels. DNA table sugar or sucrose, C 12 H 22 O 11 benzene, C 6 H 6 ethanol or grain alcohol, C 2 H 6 O Examples of Inorganic Compounds \nInorganics include salts, metals, substances made from single elements and any other compounds that don't contain carbon bonded to hydrogen. \ncontinue reading below our video 10 Best Universities in the United States table salt or sodium chloride, NaCl carbon dioxide, CO 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:47:47.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
