In the end, CC couldn’t support Leclerc with enough offense and the Pioneers emerged with a 2-1 victory — their 11th straight over the Tigers. \nDenver outshot its Front Range rival 39-15 and Leclerc finished with 37 saves in the opener of the two-game, home-and-home Gold Pan series, which moves to the Broadmoor World Arena on Saturday at 6 p.m. Senior defenseman and team captain Will Butcher had two assists for DU. \nDenver took a 1-0 lead 1:37 into the game and led 2-0 at 5:34 of the second period. Defenseman Adam Plant beat Leclerc with a long shot through traffic on his first shift of the game and forward Jarid Lukosevicius struck on the power play early in the second.
