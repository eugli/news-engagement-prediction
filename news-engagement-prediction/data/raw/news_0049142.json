Cast members drawn from support group \nAfter her brother's death, she established a community group Talk Out Loud to help address youth mental health and suicide prevention. \nSome of the 41 Seconds cast members are from that group. \nTara Shapcott plays Nick's ex-girlfriend Chloe in the Fringe show. \nThe 17-year-old said she had struggled with anxiety and depression and that playing the role had been challenging, but in a very supportive environment. \n\"My character doesn't understand suicide and mental health, so trying to portray a character who's somewhat ignorant is somewhat difficult because I can relate to someone with mental health and suicide issues so well,\" she said. \nShe hopes to help break the widely held stigma of discussing mental health and suicide, something she said was still difficult for many young people. \n\"I feel younger people are always judged for talking about mental health because a lot might think they're attention-seeking, that they have nothing to be sad about because they're young,\" she said. Monologues tell real-life stories \nInterspersed through the play are four monologues, telling real-life stories about mental health and suicide. \nGalouzis said she hoped the audiences would engage with, and be helped by, hearing actual life stories. \n\"I see it as a quite a powerful addition to the play — rather than being just separated into your normal acts and scenes and so on, these are real stories,\" she said. \n\"We've had many rehearsals where we've been in tears.\" \nVinnie Esposito has battled depression and lost a friend to suicide recently. He performs one of the monologues. \n\"Basically my monologue is on the love of my life, a girl, and obviously things don't work out and it's just expressing that — it's still hard now,\" he said. \nThe 34-year-old said he had considered but never attempted suicide and being involved with 41 Seconds was about healing and paying it forward. \n\"By me helping other people, I'm helping myself — that's how I see it myself — and I'm more than happy to share my story to help them. If I can save one life, that's a job done for me.\" \nGalouzis said the show had a powerful finale. \n\"Each actor walks on with a pair of shoes that belonged to a loved one, and then we show a slideshow of faces lost by suicide,\" she said. \nAfter the Fringe, she plans to take 41 Seconds into schools.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:53:11.840+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
