Unwittingly, some of the attendees watching the speech began waving the flag around. \nSnapchat’s Head of News Peter Hamby caught a few of these photos, and reported that attendees were waving around Russian flags. Crowd at CPAC waving these little pro-Trump flags that look exactly like the Russian flag. Staffers quickly come around to confiscate them. pic.twitter.com/YhPpkwFCNc \n— Peter Hamby (@PeterHamby) February 24, 2017 \nIt was soon revealed by James O’Keefe that the person handing them out was a man named Ryan Clayton. Clayton works for a man named Bob Creamer who heads up the group “Americans Take Action,” which was at one point the subject of a sting by O’keefe. Creamer’s group allegedly had illegally used campaign expenditures from then Democratic candidate for President Hillary Clinton for advertising projects. \nAccording to O’Keefe, Creamer and Project Veritas have had run ins in the past. Upon being discovered, Creamer was ejected from the conference. This was Ryan Clayton from Bob Creamer group \"Americans Take Action\" handing Russian flags. Ryan was forcibly removed. You edited that out. https://t.co/hKwywREjn5 \n— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) February 24, 2017 Ryan Clayton, @Project_Veritas nemesis gets kicked out of @realDonaldTrump speech at #CPAC for handing out Russian flags. pic.twitter.com/0rLgeqIC3A \n— James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) February 24, 2017 \nThe punchline of the story is that a Democratic operative was handing out Russian flags in order to make it seem like the Trump supporting crowd was pro-Russian to the media, who would then report it, and circulate the lie around the world. \nTheBlaze’s own Dana Loesch called Hamby out for not mentioning the fact that the culprit behind the false-flag operation was a leftist troll. Hi @PeterHamby , you do know this wasn’t conservatives, right? Will you include this? —> https://t.co/Dsnd9yqaVx #CPAC2017 https://t.co/sAbbhoPMzz \n— Dana Loesch (@DLoesch) February 24, 2017 \nLater, Hamby still had not clarified what had happened, despite numerous tweets being sent to him proving that the flag prank was done by Democrats. Instead, Hamby simply tweeted out pictures of Clayton handing them out, and CPAC organizers confiscating them.
