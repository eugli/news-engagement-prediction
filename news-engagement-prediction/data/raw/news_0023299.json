Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA pensioner whose wife died ‘in agony’ after doctors failed to recognise her bowel condition has been awarded a six-figure payout. \nAnthony Lindley, 70, believes Susan would still be alive today if medics at Tameside Hospital had spotted the blockage in her bowel that was causing her so much pain. \nGrandmother-of-five Susan, 54, was admitted three times with severe stomach pain and vomiting in the two months prior to her death. \nIt was only after being transferred to Wythenshawe Hospital that the problem was finally diagnosed. \nBy then it was too late and the devoted mum-of-two died in August 2014 during an operation to try and save her. \nTameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust has now accepted that had she had surgery sooner, it is likely she would have survived.

(Photo: Manchester Evening News) \n“They told me to go home and get some sleep, but I had only just got into bed when they phoned and told me to go back because she’d gone.” \nRetired coach driver Anthony has now found love again with his second wife Joyce, but says he still thinks of Susan every day. \nHe planted a tree and has dedicated a bench to her in Greenfield, Oldham, where he regularly visits to lay flowers.
