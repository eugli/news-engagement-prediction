Article continues below \nDuring this excellent purple patch, Emery helped PSG achieve one of the greatest results in the club’s history: a 4-0 victory over Barcelona at the Parc des Princes earlier this month. \nPSG have also kept up the pace with Ligue 1 leaders AS Monaco, who sit three points clear of the Parisians and Nice with 11 games of the season remaining.

Video: PSG score goal straight off the training ground \nA fantastic video has emerged of PSG’s opening goal against Marseille which shows how Emery reacted on the touchline. \nWatch Emery’s actions and you can clearly tell that the first goal, scored by Marquinhos, was a set-piece routine straight from the training ground. \nMarco Verratti swung the ball towards the left-hand side of the penalty area, Thiago Silva headed it across the face of goal and his compatriot applied the finish from close range. \nEmery knew exactly what was coming during the move and pretended to head the ball as if he was the Brazilian centre-back. \nWatch it here... Why this goal will delight Emery \nIt’s a funny clip - but it shows PSG’s players are taking on board the instructions of Emery and his backroom staff during the training sessions. \nFor football managers, there’s no better sight than watching a training drill come to life during a competitive match. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
