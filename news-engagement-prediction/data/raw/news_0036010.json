It will take many years to develop these systems.\" \nThe Associated Press originally published the paragraph that included the mention of monitoring private channels, but its story has since been updated \"to substitute a quote on artificial intelligence to reflect what was actually in the manifesto.\" \nWhile it's common and expected for social networks to try and keep terrorists off their platforms, suggesting that Facebook plans to listen in on seemingly \"private\" conversations raises a flag about the company's stance on privacy. \nWe've reached out to Facebook for an explanation of why the line was removed from the final manifesto, and we'll update this story with what we hear back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T19:52:37.052+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
