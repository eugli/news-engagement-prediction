Crisis averted. Giphy \nUnfortunately, that wasn’t the case when some poor kid left his or her pink teddy bear at Cork Airport in Ireland. \nIt seems the owner of the teddy bear is long gone on their journey to wherever they were going. \nThe good news is the kind folks over at Cork Airport aren’t at all heartless. \nThey’ve set out on a mission to reunite the owner of the teddy bear with their stuffed BFF , according to Mashable. \nCork Airport recently shared a post on Facebook regarding their mission to return the pink teddy to its rightful owner, saying, \nThis pink Teddy should have been heading off on a flight earlier today but got separated from his traveling companions. If you are missing Teddy please contact us. Teddy has had his dinner and tea and is relaxing in our lounge at present. \nThis is just proof there are still good people out there. *Breathes a sigh of relief* Here’s the Facebook post Cork Airport shared in hopes of locating the owner of a pink teddy bear that was left behind in Ireland. \nThis pink Teddy should have been heading off on a flight earlier today but got separated from his travelling companions…. \nNai-post ni Cork Airport noong Linggo, Pebrero 5, 2017 Despite garnering nearly 900 shares on Facebook, the owner of the bear has yet to come forward.

Teddy has decided to entertain staff and passengers while waiting for his rightful little owner… \nPosted by Cork Airport on Tuesday, February 7, 2017 \nSo, the bad news is the owner of this teddy bear obviously hasn’t been located yet. The good news, however, is the bear is surprisingly coping well during this tough time. \nThat’s not to mention he’s now been crowned a viral sensation thanks to Cork Airport’s Facebook-savvy ways. I don’t know about you, but I have a feeling all of this newfound fame could lead to him reuniting with his family in the end. \nHey, owner of this stuffed animal, where ever you are, CHECK FACEBOOK MORE OFTEN!
