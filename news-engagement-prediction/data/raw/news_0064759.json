Cables will monitor his heart and provide an emergency video link.\nJournalists looked on as workmen pressed together the two halves of the rock at the gallery on Wednesday.\n\"The purpose is to feel the aging stone inside the rock,\" Poincheval told Quartz Media during his weeks of preparation for the ordeal.\n\"There is my own breathing, and then the rock which lives, still humid because it was extracted not so long ago from the quarry. So there is that flow, that coming and going, between myself and the stone.\"\nMental challenge At the time, he was coy about how he would go to the toilet, but in the moments running up to his entombment he came clean to AFP news agency, admitting he would urinate into empty water bottles and sit on a small container to excrete.\nAnd the smell?\n\"The stone will absorb some of the smell,\" he said. \"I think I can take it.\"\nInstead, he says, one of the biggest challenges will be psychological: keeping grasp of reality.\nPoincheval is an old hand at putting his body through the bizarre and potentially perilous - often within a confined space, having previously spent 13 days inside a bear .\nPoincheval has also spent a week atop a 20m (65-foot) pole outside Paris's Gard du Nord train station... ...spent 13 days living inside a hollowed-out bear ...navigated the Rhone river inside a large plastic bottle with a cork in it ... and spent a week in an underground hole beneath a bookshop in Marseilles. He also once crossed France in a completely straight line using a compass If he emerges intact from the boulder, Poincheval plans to sit on a dozen eggs for the three or four weeks they take to hatch.\nAnd his ultimate ambition is to \"walk on the clouds\", he told AFP.\n\"I have been working on it for five years, but it is not quite there yet.\"\nYou might also like:\nSilo art: The massive murals helping small town Australia Miniature worlds: Artist Joshua Smith's tiny creations replicate real buildings The Instagram artist who fooled thousands", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ED26/production/_94801706_gettyimages-610511264.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7F16/production/_92443523_464x2.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/11061/production/_94792796_b54083ad-227c-44cf-9ecf-a289bccf75e2.jpg", "https://qz.com/904981/french-artist-abraham-poincheval-is-going-to-live-inside-a-rock-for-a-week/", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26837085", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/B676/production/_94801764_gettyimages-482497872.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/13B46/production/_94801708_gettyimages-152473042.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/culture/story/20160307-the-instagram-artist-who-fooled-thousands", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/in-pictures-39030785", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-39023899", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/54CE/production/_94801712_gettyimages-481709751.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-22T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:47:04.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
