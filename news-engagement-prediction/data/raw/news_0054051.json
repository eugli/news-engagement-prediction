Planes' time on loan from United States extended \nDeputy Commissioner Rogers said this year's loan of Thor and Southern Belle from America was extended by more than a month, with both air tankers now due to be returned in March. \n\"We had some very real concerns about how NSW was faring, so we kept them on and, given the fires that have occurred in that time, I am really glad we did,\" he said.
