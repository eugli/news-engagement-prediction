In 2012, the ban was declared invalid by an Ontario Superior Court judge. \nFitzsimmons said she wants to bring the debate back to city hall. \nREAD MORE: Friends remember Toronto filmmaker Rob Stewart who died on dive \n“I thought to re-open the discussion on a ban of shark fins in Toronto would be a good place to start to honour his work,” she said. \n“From my understanding, the previous ban had banned the sale and consumption of shark fins but if it’s framed a bit differently, it might have a better chance to stand up in court.” \nA statement from Mayor John Tory’s office said the court “struck down the ban” and ruled city council “did not have the authority to enact such a prohibition” because it was outside the jurisdiction of the city. \n“Actions to deter the importing and sale of shark fins should be taken at the federal level,” the statement said. \n“If the federal government does not restrict the importation of shark fins, the City has few tools to regulate its sale in our city.” \nFitzsimmons said the amount of support the petition has received is a testament to the work Stewart was doing. \n“I wouldn’t have known about shark finning if it wasn’t for him and I’m sure many people who signed and supported the petition wouldn’t have known about shark finning, either,” she said. \n“I think there is increased education, awareness. There is so much evidence to support this that it seems like something that should be a no brainer.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
