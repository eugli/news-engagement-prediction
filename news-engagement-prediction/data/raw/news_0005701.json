Hawker centres would then become social spaces for people to come together not just to dine but enjoy or participate in community activities, the committee said. \nMore amenities such as free Wi-Fi access and child-friendly spaces should also be provided for customers, it added. \nTo cultivate a tray-return culture among Singaporeans, the National Environment Agency and hawker centre operators should work with cleaning companies to dispel the misperception that cleaners will be made redundant, the committee said. \n“A good tray-return culture would facilitate faster turnover of tables and reduce waiting time for the next diner and thus, potentially increasing sales for the hawkers,” the committee said. “It would also result in a cleaner and more pleasant dining environment.” Illustration from the Hawker Centre 3.0 Committee's report. \nMinister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli said his ministry is studying the report and will respond “in due course”. \nThere are currently more than 100 hawker centres in Singapore, with more than 6,000 cooked food stalls located islandwide. - CNA/xk", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T11:09:07.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
