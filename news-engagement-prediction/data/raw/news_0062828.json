A third person, an American who tried to intervene, was also injured. \n“We can’t let hatred win,” said Indian-American Senator from California Kamala Harris. “Extremely saddened to hear the news out of Kansas. My sympathies go out to the victims and their families,” the Democratic Senator said in a tweet. \n“My thoughts are with the victims and families shaken by the shooting in Kansas. Senseless acts of violence have no place in our country. I’m heartbroken by this tragedy,” said Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. \nMs. Jayapal is the first Indian-American woman ever elected to the US House of Representatives. \nThe incident has reignited fears of hate crimes among the immigrant Indian community. According to eyewitnesses, the shooter believed the victims were from the Middle East. \nMs. Jayapal said since Donald Trump’s election as the US president in November, hate crimes have risen as a result of his administration’s controversial ideas against immigrants. \nIn the Seattle suburb of Redmond, a Muslim Association of Puget Sound mosque was twice vandalised since the election. \n“This is not normal. We must declare our entire country a hate-free zone and fight to protect it as such. During this moment of tragedy, I stand with Indian-Americans, Muslim- Americans, and all groups impacted by the dangerous rhetoric coming out of the Trump administration,” Ms. Jayapal added. \nIndian-American Congressman from California Ro Khanna in a statement said his condolences go out to the families of the men involved in this senseless act of violence in Kansas City. \n“Any act of violence fuelled by hatred and xenophobia and prejudice cannot be tolerated. I have faith in local and federal law enforcement to justly investigate this shooting as a hate crime,” Mr. Khanna said. \nDemocratic Congressman from California Brad Sherman said the victims and their families were in his thoughts and prayers. “Xenophobia and hatred do not belong in America.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T12:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:35:09.565+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
