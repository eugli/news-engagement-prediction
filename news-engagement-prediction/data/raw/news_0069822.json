The hearse rolled through the streets around 6 a.m. on Tuesday morning as a grim, one-day visual aid for “That Text Or Call Could End It All,” a week-long campaign launched by Toronto Police on Monday to curtail drivers who illegally talk, text, or type on hand-held devices.\nAs part of an awareness campaign, the force used a hearse as an unmarked police vehicle on Tuesday. The message: if you text and drive, this is where you could wind up.\n“It’s a wakeup call for everyone,” said police spokesman Clint Stibbe. He said people should consider the different forms of distracted driving — texting, handling a coffee or talking on the phone — and the grave consequences those actions can have.\n“Surprisingly, we didn’t see that many people using their devices. There were some—but believe me, if there was more, we would have stopped more,” Stibbe added.\n  Using a hearse to draw attention to a distracted-driving campaign is somewhat appropriate: distracted driving is one of the top four causes of road fatalities in the city, next to speed, impaired driving, and those caught without a seatbelt.\nPolice officers issue an average of 16,000 tickets a year for distracted driving. Since 2011, the Toronto Police Service has also issued over 109,000 charges relating to the offense.\nOfficers keep an eye out for distracted drivers 24/7, Stibbe said. But the campaign—and the hearse—have only been around since February 2014, when the Ontario government announced it would nearly double the fines for distracted driving from $155 to $280.\nBut until March 18, 2014—the date these new fines actually took effect—there was a moratorium on distracted driving charges.\n“Essentially, anyone caught in Toronto was getting a warning for a period of time,” Stibbe explained.\n“The hearse, I think—everyone can articulate what a hearse really means. And I think it leaves a bit more of a lasting impression,” Stibbe said.\nThe hearse has been used every year with the exception of 2016—last year’s February weather was a little too cold and icy, Stibbe said.\nUntil Sunday, police officers in marked and undercover cars will be devoting “special attention” to distracted motorists while urging drivers to put their phones down while on the road.\nStibbe also shared on Twitter that one of the drivers that was pulled over was given a $490.00 ticket, and had three demerit points deducted for distracted driving.\n“Drivers must do better,” Stibbe said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:04:14.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
