The Megaupload founder faces extradition to the US over the still-standing charges. \nDotcom founded the hugely successful file-sharing site Megaupload in 2005 which boasted 50 million daily users at its peak. In 2012 the US Department of Justice shut down and seized control of the site, and commenced charges against him relating to money laundering, racketeering and wire fraud. \nSpeaking to RT in October, Dotcom described the case as “the copyright cartel in Hollywood trying to take control and monopolise of all human thought.” \n“I think the US case was demonstrated to be a sham,” Dotcom said. “I think we’ve shown with our evidence that there’s no case for extradition, there’s no case for copyright infringement and I know that they were quite unhappy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:19:22.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
