Do we get the outside committed to coming in to buy at the community? Or do we have people who are here fighting for what they already have? So, that’s the battle right now.” \nFort Worth is putting money on the neighborhood, too. \nCity records show 25 homeowners have been helped fixing up their houses through Habitat for Humanity, and the city will soon start work on a $5.3 million dollar neighborhood in the area. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.)
