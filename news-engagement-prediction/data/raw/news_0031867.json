The clinic had the help of five veterinarians, eight veterinary technicians, and 25 volunteers from various dog rescue groups. They also received donations of medicine and supplies. \nSome of the dogs were brought in from as far as Berens River, Man., about 275 kilometres north of Winnipeg. Dogs also were brought in from Pine Creek, Sandy Bay, Peguis, Waywayseecappo, Canupawakpa and Birdtail First Nations. \nKatie Powell, the director of Save a Dog Network Canada, organized the event and worked with Spirit of Hope Rescue, Manitoba Pug Rescue, K9 Advocates Manitoba, and Strays That Can't Pay. (Holly Caruk/CBC)\n\nPowell says all of the dogs that were fixed are owned, and the goals of clinic were to keep them from having unwanted puppies and hopefully reduce the number of dogs ending up sick and homeless. She says fixing the dogs also makes communities safer. \n\n\"These unwanted puppies are continuously being born. These animals are truly affecting our First Nations communities in Manitoba. Children cannot play safely outside their homes, families cannot walk to the store [for] groceries without packs of dogs [around them],\" she said. \nThousands of dogs frozen, slaughtered on Manitoba First Nations, rescuer says Battle underway to control stray dog population in First Nations communities Manitoba girl, 10, mauled to death by dogs in Lac Brochet \nPowell said many of the dogs were from communities that don't have easy access to vet care. She said some owners can't afford the procedure, or don't have means to transport their dogs. \nVolunteer veterinarian Jonas Watson helped spay and neuter some of the dogs over the weekend. The volunteers worked into the night to get the surgeries done. (Holly Caruk/CBC)\n\n\n\"Lots of them don't drive, they have young children … we really wanted to provide these community members with what they need and one of the biggest is getting the transportation,\" said Powell. \n\nDog owners paid $100 for a checkup, vaccinations, spay or neuter surgery, nail trim, identification tattoo and a new collar. Typically, spay or neuter surgery can cost anywhere from $200 to $500, Powell said. \n\nShe said by working with other rescues, who already have relationships with the communities, they were able to identify which dogs were in need and coordinate transportation. \n\n\n\"We were able to bring in way more dogs … and help a multitude of First Nations and not just isolate one community,\" said Powell. \nMobile dog clinic helps 80 dogs 2:35\nSetting up a clinic comes with red tape \nPowell said there have been similar clinics on some remote First Nations in the past, but transporting vets and supplies to them can be difficult. \nShe says  setting up temporary clinics can also be difficult because of regulations. \n\nA rule, put in place by the Manitoba Veterinary Medical Association, says a temporary clinic cannot set up in a community unless it has permission from all vets within a 250-kilometre radius. \n\"The problem with that is when you have a clinic that wants to happen an hour or two away [from Winnipeg], you're asking every vet clinic in Winnipeg. It's very overwhelming,\" said Powell. \nRed tape keeps help from reaching northern Manitoba dogs, rescue group says \nIn order to get around that rule, the group used a mobile vet clinic built inside a trailer. It's owned by Rebecca Zettler, one of the vets who volunteered her services and equipment for the clinic. \nVeterinarian Rebecca Zettler above owns the mobile vet clinic and donated her time and equipment to make the event possible. (Holly Caruk/CBC)\n\nThe trailer is licensed as a mobile clinic, so the 250-kilometre rule does not apply. \n\nJonas Watson, a volunteer vet with the event, says the rule has posed a challenge for temporary clinics in the past.\n\n\"It makes it hard for well-intentioned rescue groups to run clinics like this,\" said Watson. \nThe dogs were housed in kennels after their surgeries and were checked on by volunteers and veterinary technicians. (Holly Caruk/CBC)\nThe Veterinary Association says the rule is there as a courtesy to other vets in the area, but also as a means of ensuring regulations are followed. They say the rule is currently under review and that providing access to veterinary care in remote and under-serviced areas is a priority.\n\n\nWatson says without rescue groups taking on initiatives like this, many dogs would not get fixed and many more unwanted animals would end up being born and needing care. \n\n\"I hope that people at large hear the message and we can see some advocacy on the part of governments and animal welfare groups to really step up the way they can help First Nations communities in the province,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T16:38:33.360+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
