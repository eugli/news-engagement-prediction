The film is pure escapism.\" \nEmma lends her singing skills (and acting chops!) to Disney's live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast , her first major role since taking a year off to focus on her activism efforts. Photos Courtesy ELLE UK/ Kerry Hallihan Courtesy ELLE UK/ Kerry Hallihan \nOf the experience, she shared with the mag, \"It wasn't about me necessarily proving anythingâ€¦ I was just thinking that I have this year to myself, so let's see what we can do to 'move the needle' and make a difference.\" \nDuring her hiatus from the spotlight, Emma organized several projects with her HeForShe initiative , which she launched as a U.N. goodwill ambassador to engage men in the fight for gender equality. \nEmma also touched upon the criticism that comes with the territory of being engaged in issues beyond Hollywood. \"It really toughened me up,\" the actress explained. \"There is a level of criticism that comes with being an actress and a public figure, which I expect, but once you take a stance on something like feminism, that's a completely different ball game.\" \nAfter Beauty and the Beast premieres March 17, 2017, Watson revealed she'll get right back to activism, but don't expect a book to follow shortly thereafter. \n\"I need to see and do a bit more first... I'm no expert, and when people push me into a corner of 'here's Emma Watson to lecture you on feminism,' it's uncomfortable because I am aware I have a long way to go. I am not sure I deserve all the respect I get yet, but I'm working on it,\" she said. \nPick up the March issue of Elle UK , on sale now.
