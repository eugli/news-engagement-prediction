He said robot taxes could help fund projects like caring for the elderly or working with children in school. Quartz reported that European Union politicians considered a proposal to tax robots in the past. The law was rejected.\nRecode, citing a McKinsey report, said that 50 per cent of jobs performed by humans are vulnerable to robots, which could result in the loss of about $USD2.7 trillion ($3.5 trillion) in the US alone.\nMicrosoft founder Bill Gates is currently the world’s richest man.

Some of it can come directly in some type of robot tax. I don’t think the robot companies are going to be outraged that there might be a tax. It’s OK.”\nLast month, Gates told FOX Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo that he is excited to work with President Trump and his administration, especially when it comes to the US government’s support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation he said.\nBill Gates leaves Trump Tower after meeting with Donald Trump in December. he said in an interview he’s looking forward to working with the new US president.
