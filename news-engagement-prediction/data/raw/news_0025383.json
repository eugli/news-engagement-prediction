This past weekend, Alec Baldwin hosted the show for a record 17th time. The 58-year-old managed to pull in the highest ratings SNL had seen in six years, according to Variety. \nA video posted by Saturday Night Live – SNL (@nbcsnl) on Feb 12, 2017 at 2:08pm PST \nSaturday Night Live scored a 7.2 rating for this past weekend’s show, the best since January 2011, when Jim Carrey hosted and the band The Black Keys performed and the show brought in a 7.8. \nThe 7.2 rating for Saturday’s show amounts to about 10.6 million followers, which is around two million more than the average viewership last season. \nA photo posted by Alec Baldwin (@iamabfalecbaldwin) on Jan 14, 2017 at 8:38am PST \nThe SNL ratings figure for the last show is thought to be likely to rise once delayed viewing numbers are taken into account. \nThis means that it is the most-watched SNL season since 1994-1995, which was 22 years ago. \nIn this past weekend’s episode, Alec played Donald Trump as he stood before TV’s The People’s Court defending his travel ban with a shirtless President Putin as his character witness. \nMelissa McCarthy also kicked off the show with a hilarious start, impersonating White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. \nMcCarthy used a leaf blower to tame the press who were asking her questions. \nAfter debuting her Sean Spicer character on last weekend’s episode of Saturday Night Live, sources within the White House told Politico that President Trump was particularly upset by the fact that his press secretary was being ridiculed. \nSNL cast member Leslie Jones also tried her hand at playing Donald Trump, wearing a blonde wig and eyebrows for the skit. \nA photo posted by Saturday Night Live – SNL (@nbcsnl) on Feb 11, 2017 at 9:45pm PST \nSaturday Night Live touched on the uneasy feelings about the current state of America. \nA photo posted by Saturday Night Live – SNL (@nbcsnl) on Feb 12, 2017 at 7:56am PST \nRELATED REPORTS BY THE INQUISITR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:32:06.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
