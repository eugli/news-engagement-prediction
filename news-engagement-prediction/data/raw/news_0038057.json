Credit Shannon Stapleton/Reuters The final day of New York Fashion Week was meant to be the quietest, with just one big show on the schedule Thursday afternoon. But at 11 a.m., at Grand Central Terminal, an event was held that drew Diane von Furstenberg, Valentino Garavani, Anna Wintour , Michael R. Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton to Vanderbilt Hall. It was not a runway show or an exclusive party, but rather a first-day-of-issue ceremony dedicated to the inspiration for the Postal Serviceâ€™s newest stamp collection: the designer Oscar de la Renta . Police officers and security personnel were out in full force, telling a gathering crowd to disperse under the orders of a fire marshal. Speaking of Mr. de la Renta, Mrs. Clinton reflected on their friendship, recalling the first time she met him as a first lady, and the times Mr. de la Renta and his wife, Annette, hosted Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton in the Dominican Republic, where Mr. de la Renta was born. (He left for Spain when he was 19 and moved to New York in 1963.) NYT Living Newsletter Get lifestyle news from the Style, Travel and Food sections, from the latest trends to news you can use.
