Sara Boboltz Entertainment Editor, The Huffington Post \nWith one look , Hillary Clinton brought the Palace Theatre to its feet. \nAt a showing of Broadway’s “Sunset Boulevard” Wednesday night, the former Democratic presidential candidate prompted applause and cheers from audience members as she took her seat among them. \nSeveral Twitter users and reporters in the theater took note of the enthusiastic response. — Logan Culwell-Block (@loganculwell) February 16, 2017 \nSince her shocking loss in the 2016 election, Clinton has caught a few Broadway shows, including “In Transit,” “The Humans” and “The Color Purple,” where she was also treated to warm welcomes . Her appearance at “The Color Purple” with husband Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea marked the revival’s last performance, but the former candidate received several ovations of her own . \nHer reception stands in sharp contrast to the somber message about diversity the cast of “Hamilton” delivered to current Vice President Mike Pence when he caught a performance in late November. \nAt New York’s Palace Theatre, Clinton gamely waved to supporters and posed for photos.

The musical features scores by Andrew Lloyd Weber as it tells the story of Norma Desmond, an aging star who dreams of renewed fame. \nAfter the show, Clinton took a trip backstage to meet the cast.

In a taped video that opened the 2017 MAKERS conference in California earlier this month, however, she reiterated her belief in the values that shaped her campaign. \n“Despite all the challenges we face, I remain convinced that, yes, the future is female,” she said.
