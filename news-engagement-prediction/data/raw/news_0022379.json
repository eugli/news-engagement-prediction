Shouldn't we be offering her (non-televised) counselling and not collectively laughing at her and her weird made-up accent? \nOn the other hand, she's is modelling her own merchandise line in a rap star's video, so at least she's making bank. (We hope.) \nWhat were you doing at 13? For better or worse, it probably wasn't this.
