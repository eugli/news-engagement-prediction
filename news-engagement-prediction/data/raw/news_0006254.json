Our first glimpse at Emma (Photo: Disney) Will we see more of her soon? (Photo: Disney) \nThe footage then cuts to interior shots of a ballroom in the grand palace, where a piano - which looks like it hasn't been played in decades - sits gathering dust. \nMoments later, the camera then zooms in on a portrait of young man before a claw reaches up and rips the canvas. \nIn the background, a roar can be heard - our first introduction to the Beast, although we don't actually get to see him. The abandoned home of the Beast (Photo: Disney) \nA heavy door then creeks open before Lumiere [Ewan McGregor] gasps in a French accent, \"Look, it's a girl! What if she's the one?\" \nIan McKellen then makes his début as Cogsworth, as his voice can be heard sarcastically quipping, \"Yes, I can see it's a girl.\" It will be transformed (Photo: youtube) Belle's backstory is changing \nIn the animated movie, Belle feels frustrated with her life in the \"quiet village\" where \"everyday is like the one before\". \nHer father, Maurice, is an inventor, while Belle feels out of place but has her love of books. \nEmma Watson will now be the inventor in the new movie. \n'What is she doing with her time?’ So, we created a backstory for her, which was that she had invented a kind of washing machine, so that, instead of doing laundry, she could sit and use that time to read instead,\" she added. \"So, yeah, we made Belle an inventor.” \nMaurice, her father, creates music boxes as a way to show Belle around the world - and what she is missing.

Menken wrote the original score with Howard Ashman, while Tim Rice is known for his Disney lyrics on Aladdin. \nThe songs include; Our Song Lives On which appears at several points in the movie. \nMenken also teased there's going to be a \"wonderful singer\" for the end credits. \nDan Stevens will sing For Evermore, when he releases Belle from her 'prison' to go to her father. \nThe third is Days in the Sun, when the objects and Belle are falling asleep. \nBroadway legend Audra McDonald, who plays Madame De Garderobe will also get to sing in the prologue. Read More Disney's Beauty and the Beast live-action movie has three new songs - Alan Menken explains Wait, is Angela Lansbury not keen? \nThe actress who voiced Mrs Potts and sang the classic Tale as Old as Time was asked about the new remake. \nWhen asked what her initial reaction to news of the project was, she said: \"I was a bit taken aback, naturally. I thought, 'Why? Why are we doing this over again?' But I guess, I don’t know why they’re doing it. But they are, and it will be interesting to see what they do with it.\" \nShe isn't quite against it then - and seems to think the live film will be very different to the cartoon. \n\"I don’t blame them for doing it. But, I’m sorry, they’re not really on our territory. We did it as cartoon characters, and that is quite different from live actors,\" she added. Read More Angela Lansbury's reaction to new Beauty and the Beast re-make \nBill Condon says Emma Watson brings an intelligence to the role of Belle \n\"Belle is someone who doesn't really care about becoming a princess. She's more interested in seeing the world and figuring out who she is than in finding a man and getting married,\" Condon said in a statement. \nHe added, \"We all know how intelligent and worldly and sophisticated Emma is, and while that doesn't describe Belle, it is what Belle aspires to be, and it is the innate intelligence that Emma brings to the role that is such a crucial element when you're doing a live-action film.\" \nOk, so this sounds a little, well mean. Belle had brains, she was clever, but we'd agree she wasn't that wordly - cue Little Town playing.
