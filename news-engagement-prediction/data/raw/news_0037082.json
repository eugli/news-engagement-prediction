Amy Duggar just admitted that she's a huge fan of sex toys , and we're not quite sure how to respond. A round of applause for thoroughly breaking the Duggar stereotype once again? A giggle over imagining Jim Bob and Michelle's reaction to the news of their freaky niece? Right now, we're still too busy picking our jaws up off the floor. \nShe's the rebel Duggar for a reason, y'all.

Even though Amy has long been the black sheep of the Duggar family, we never expected her to be quite this open about her sexuality. \nMore from CafeMom: Anna Duggar Might Finally Be Leaving Josh for Good \nAmy and Dillon have had a bit of a bumpy ride (no pun intended) this season on Marriage Boot Camp , with her being accused of not taking it seriously, and him getting called out for speaking her condescendingly. After this clip though, it looks like they've got at least one thing covered -- their sex life. \nYou go and get yours, girl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:18:16.848+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
