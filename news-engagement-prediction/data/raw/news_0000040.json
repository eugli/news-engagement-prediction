Those who are often already marginalized and discriminated against – particularly Muslims – have been particular targets for Trump. \n“Trump directly threatens steps towards tackling climate change, fighting discrimination, inequality, peace and disarmament. At the very moment when the world needs more solidarity, more cooperation, and a greater commitment to justice, he proposes to build walls and wants to turn us against each other.” \nOrganizers behind the February 20 London demonstration hope the big celebrity names will encourage others to join. They estimate up to a million people could attend. \n“People in Britain never voted for this. It is our duty as citizens to speak out. We oppose this state visit to the UK and commit ourselves to one of the biggest demonstrations in British history, to make very clear to our government, and to the world, this is not in our name,” the letter adds.
