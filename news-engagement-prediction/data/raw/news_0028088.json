As well as being painful, you could end up wasting emergency service time if you have to call us out.” Read More Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson in Fifty Shades Darker (Photo: Handout) Couples are being inspired by Fifty Shades \nFirefighters had to come to the rescue one ‘victim’ when doctors could not remove two metal rings that had been stuck on his penis for three days in November 2014. \nHe had gone to a London A&E in the early hours and the two firefighters had to scrub up and remove the rings using pedal cutters - a hydraulic handheld piece of cutting equipment. \nOther past call outs included helping free a man from a toaster and a vacuum cleaner. \nThe brigade said since last April they had to free nine men trapped in rings - the same as for a whole two previous years.
