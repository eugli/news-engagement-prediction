(JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Getty Images) Some protesters said Thursday's walkout may have sapped some of the energy for Friday's action.\n\"The immigration event yesterday was a big event, but not everyone can be at them all,\" said Joe Balkis, a retired United Parcel Service worker who was one of approximately 75 protesters at Daley Plaza in Chicago.\nTrump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration and signed an executive order, which was put on hold by federal courts, restricting entry from seven Muslim-majority countries. Those policies, along with a series of federal raids last week, have alarmed immigrant rights' groups.\nStrike4Democracy urged Americans to stay away from work, donate their lunch money to a worthy cause and contact congressional representatives about the strike.\nSince his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has faced a steady stream of protests and marches, highlighted by mass rallies focussed on women's rights that drew millions of people around the globe on the day after he was sworn in.\n(Additional reporting by Robert Chiarito in Chicago and Ian Simpson in Washington, writing by Joseph Ax in New York; editing by Bill Trott and Jonathan Oatis)\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn3XBx?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn3XBx?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/9f1cf4f4-5", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn3XBx?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn3XBx?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://video.foxnews.com/v/feed/playlist/928378949001.xml?template=fox&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAn48fi.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA42Hq5.img", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/9f1cf4f4-5282-43ca-99c7-9d00ef5d2483/15b540cf-8689-43b2-ba88-6883520dbced.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn3XBx&lang=en-us&flow_id=032f31b7-573f-4685-b2c0-f19d41ffe1c3", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn3XBx%3focid%3dst&text=%27General+Strike%27+protests+against+Trump+take+place+across+US&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn3XBx%3focid%3dst", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA9UODq.img", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn3XBx%3focid%3dsl&title=%27General+Strike%27+protests+against+Trump+take+place+across+US&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f01%2fen-us%2fAAn3XBx%3focid%3dsl", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBphlIt.img"], "published": "2017-02-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:52:01.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
