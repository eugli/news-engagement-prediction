(Kent Porter/The Press Democrat/Associated Press)\nReservoir gushing water Meanwhile several other communities downstream from a Northern California reservoir gushing water for the first time in 20 years braced for flash floods and evacuations. The surge released from Don Pedro Dam into the Tuolumne River in the foothills east of Modesto was expected to reach overtopped levees later in the day.\nKatie Whitley, who manages the Driftwood Mobile Home Park in Modesto, said residents nearest the river have been moving their trailers out since the start of the weekend.\nWhat to know about California's failing Oroville Dam \"We're just holding our own,\" Whitley told the Los Angeles Times. \"That's what we have to do. You just have to hope for the best. But you can expect it when you live on the river.\"\nThe water released from Don Pedro is expected to reach its peak along a stretch near Vernalis that's already at danger stage, said Tim Daly, a spokesman for the San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services. The water isn't expected to spill over the levees but rather increase pressure on them, causing possible breaks in any weak places.\nThe Anderson Dam in Santa Clara County reached capacity over the weekend, and after heavy rain, it began overflowing into the Coyote Creek.\nA member of Cal Fire, right, talks to workers on the Oroville Dam project in front of its main spillway in Oroville, Calif., on Monday. (Hector Amezcua/The Sacramento Bee/Associated Press)\nAtmospheric rivers The rains were the latest produced by a series of storms generated by so-called atmospheric rivers that dump massive quantities of Pacific Ocean water on California after carrying it aloft from as far away as Hawaii.\nIn the Sierra Nevada range, one of the main routes to Lake Tahoe was in danger of collapsing after a roadway shoulder gave way following heavy storms, leaving a gaping hole on part of Highway 50, Caltrans engineer Jarrett Woodruff said.\nCrews opened one lane Tuesday as Caltrans workers tried to fix the road failure after numerous mudslides blocked it for days in recent weeks.\nThe water level rose at Lake Oroville for the first time since authorities ordered an emergency evacuation of 188,000 people more than a week ago after a damaged spillway caused flooding concerns.\nThe rains have saturated the once-drought stricken region and wreaked havoc for residents. At least four people have died in the storms throughout the state in the last week.\nÂ© The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-22T21:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:30:36.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
