The owner of the home interrupted the robbery and ended up chasing the suspects who left in a vehicle that belonged to the homeowner. Story continues below \nAccording to Staff Sgt. Glenn Henry, police were en route to the home when they happened upon a collision at the intersection of Highway 845 and Township Road 84. \nHenry told Global News the collision involved the recently stolen vehicle – driven by the suspects, and a second vehicle – driven by the homeowner. He said the stolen vehicle stopped suddenly and was hit from behind by the homeowner. \nPolice said the two suspects took off on foot but were caught in a nearby farmer’s field. \nA 34-year-old man from Fort Macleod and a 23-year-old woman from Standoff are facing numerous charges and will appear in a Lethbridge court Monday. \nPolice said a second stolen vehicle was found at the property that had allegedly been broken into. \nIn the release, RCMP included a reminder to discourage citizens from getting involved in any crime in progress. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:13:21.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
