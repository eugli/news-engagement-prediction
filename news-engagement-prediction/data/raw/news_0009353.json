Plan B, he said, was to fly her to stay with relatives in Canada, Europe or Armenia.\nBut her arrival Monday was seamless.\nLess than an hour after his fiancee landed, Meneshian spotted her carting her luggage out of the Tom Bradley International Terminal.\n“Nothing happened to me,” she said, laughing and smiling. She identified herself only as Ana. “I have school, I have a job. I have to go back to my life.”\nL.A. federal judge orders a temporary halt to part of Trump's travel ban Joel Rubin A federal judge in Los Angeles has added another legal ruling against President Trump’s controversial suspension of travel from a group of predominantly Muslim countries, issuing an emergency order that forbids government officials from enforcing many of the new rules.\nUsing sweeping, unambiguous...\nA federal judge in Los Angeles has added another legal ruling against President Trump’s controversial suspension of travel from a group of predominantly Muslim countries, issuing an emergency order that forbids government officials from enforcing many of the new rules.\nUsing sweeping, unambiguous...\n(Joel Rubin) Amid the confusion and apprehension following Trump’s recent executive order temporarily blocking travelers entering the United States from seven Muslim-majority countries, there were stories like that of Ana.\nThe executive order, which Trump said is needed to protect the country from terrorist attacks, blocks citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from coming to the U.S. for at least 90 days. It also imposes a ban for 120 days on refugees from any country entering the U.S. and bars refugees from Syria indefinitely.\nCritics said the ban unfairly targets Muslims and imposes undue hardship on innocent families.\nMeneshian’s mother, who was also at the airport, spent her weekend much less worried. In fact, she said she had zero concerns about her future daughter-in-law’s travel plans and supports Trump’s executive order.\n“Our borders have to be secure,” said Zara Meneshian, who immigrated to the U.S. from Soviet Armenia in the late ’70s. “I waited 30 years to vote for Donald Trump.”\nHer only qualm was the chaos and confusion that erupted when the order was put in place immediately.\nAs she was leaving the airport, she told a protester — holding a sign that read, “I stand with all immigrants” — to go home.\n“You have your priorities wrong,” she told him.\nThere were a dozen or more protesters outside the arrivals area with an air horn late Wednesday, and attorneys said the last traveler they spoke to, from Iran, estimated that 50 people from different countries were still being detained.\nTuesday, a family of six from Afghanistan — a country not included in Trump’s order — was detained for more than seven hours with no food, according to Kristy White, a volunteer immigration attorney.\nShe said the father, a mechanic, and his family were granted special immigrant visas for his work with the U.S. military in Afghanistan.\nBut when he landed, White said, customs officers accused him of having fake passports and threatened to deport him and his family. It’s unclear if Trump’s executive order was cited.\nHe said the officers told him he would never get into this country, White said.\nBetsy DeVos 'is unprepared and unqualified' to be Education secretary, charter school booster Eli Broad says Joy Resmovits Eli Broad , the prominent local philanthropist behind a massive effort to increase the number of charter schools in Los Angeles, is protesting the appointment of Betsy DeVos as secretary of Education.\nBroad sent a letter to U.S. senators Wednesday, asking them to vote against President Trump’s nominee.\n...

(Joy Resmovits) The man was taken to one room, White said, while his wife and four young children, all under 10 years old, were placed in another.\nOfficers allegedly tried to compel the man, who is illiterate, to sign paperwork renouncing his visa, but he refused, White said.\n“He said, ‘I’ve been trying to get this visa for three years — they’re not going to take it away,’ ” she said.\nOfficers told him they would “call Kabul” to find out if the passports were authentic, and if no one answered, he and his family would be deported, White said.\nWhat transpired afterward is unclear, but around 8:30 p.m., the family was released.\n“They all grabbed water from us as soon as they came out and started drinking it,” White said.\nShe added that during the detention, she tried to file paperwork with Customs and Border Protection officials indicating that she was the family’s attorney. “They wouldn’t take it,” she said. “No one’s getting access to counsel back there.”\nOn Wednesday, a relief organization was helping the family resettle.\nalene.tchekmedyian@latimes.com\nFollow me on Twitter @AleneTchek\nALSO\nL.A. federal judge orders a temporary halt to part of Trump's travel ban\nTrump travels to Dover Air Force Base to honor first service member killed in action on his watch\nDemocrats and liberal activists face uphill battle against Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-58914fec/turbine/la-me-police-commission-ruling-video", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58934ea9/turbine/la-me-ln-federal-order-travel-ban-20170201", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-589341e1/turbine/la-4-stories-you-cant-miss-video-20170202", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58935833/turbine/la-me-eli-broad-opposes-devos-20170201", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5891f3ee/turbine/la-90-seconds-4-stories-you-cant-miss-video-20170201", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58913fba/turbine/la-na-pol-gorsuch-speech-vid", "http://twitter.com/alenetchek", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58934abd/turbine/la-me-uc-berkeley-protests-against-milo-yiannopoulos-video-20170202"], "published": "2017-02-02T03:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:30:04.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
