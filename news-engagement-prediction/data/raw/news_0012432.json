HALL OF FAMER \nSo, it’s clear to see why fans were ecstatic to find out that Angle was finally going to be inducted into the Hall of Fame in a few months’ time.

Article continues below Watch: The moment Zlatan Ibrahimovic ended Christian Fuchs' career \nThat was until fellow Hall of Famer and 16-time world champion, Ric Flair – who was actually signed with WCW at the time - advised him to go to what was then the WWF, and that was easily the best decision he made. \nFlair advised him that Vince McMahon will make him into a star, something WCW couldn't do. THE NATURE BOY: GO TO WWE! \nSpeaking to The Statement Show , Angle said: “Before I signed with WWE, I did speak with Ric Flair and he told me flat out. \n“He said, ‘You don’t want to come here. They’re going to ruin your career. Go to WWE. Let Vince McMahon mould you into the star you deserve to be.’ \n“And I listened to Ric. WCW went out of business, I think, the first year I started, so he was right.” \nIt’s great to hear that The Nature Boy was looking out for Angle and his interests, as he could have easily wanted WCW to secure his signing and bring more eyes to the product to rival McMahon. \nInstead, he knew he could be a star and knew Vince was the best man to take him to that level. \nJust imagine if he did pick WCW. \nHow do you think Kurt Angle’s career would have played out had he picked WCW over WWE?
