I could definitely see him getting Joseline pregnant again. The connection is still strong between them.” \nCredit: Instagram \nNew mom Joseline is also currently in a loving mind state, posting a photo of herself kissing her baby daddy, with sources claiming she’s still not over him. \n“I know she’s still in love with him and she does want more babies. Why not have them with Stevie? It’s not something they’re trying for, no way, but it could happen.” \nCredit: VH1 \nNews of their reported reconciliation comes just one month after the “Puerto Rican Princess” referred to her ex as “Stevie Lame” on The Real. \n\nStevie has been taking the high road however, dropping his lawsuit against the 30-year-old beauty and cancelling his petition for sole custody of their daughter. \nA post shared by Stevie J.
