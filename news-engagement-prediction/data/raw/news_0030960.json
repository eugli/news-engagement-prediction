His remarks followed a speech by Mohammed Al Gergawi, Minister of Cabinet Affairs & The Future and Chairman of the World Government Summit. As the first day of the #WorldGovSummit comes to an end, we announce day two sessions. We look forward to welcoming you tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/xIEpxzCROB - World Gov Summit (@WorldGovSummit) February 12, 2017 Schwab further elaborated on the challenges of globalism. Highlighting the changing global sentiment around capitalism and the uncertainty people feel about their future, he proposed new paradigms for governments and policy-makers to consider while making key decisions about the changeable future. Arab World can regain glory Management is the missing factor that the Arab World needs to get back its development, said His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, during his address at the World Government Summit on Sunday. In an hour-long transparent question and answer session organised to examine the revival of the development process in the Arab World, Sheikh Mohammed displayed a down-to-earth persona as he addressed a series of topics related to the Arab region. He highlighted ways to reignite the region's development. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum speaks his mind on burning issues of the day: TODAY we have those who kill others and blow themselves in the name of Islam. Such acts have nothing to do with our religion. OUR key achievement is our people; when the #UAE was founded in 1971 we had 40 graduates, today we have 77 universities. ALMOST third of #UAE cabinet members are women. This percentage may increase to 50% in the coming period.
