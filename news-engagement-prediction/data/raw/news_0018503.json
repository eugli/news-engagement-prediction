Nevertheless, its JGB holdings continue to rise, with the bank sticking to its annual target of 80 trillion yen for JGB purchases. \nWith the amount of such bonds circulating in the market declining, \"the bank will reach the limits of its bond purchase program as early as the first half of 2019,\" said Takenobu Nakashima of Nomura Securities. \nThe bank's bulk purchases have driven down long-term interest rates to around 0%. In the U.S., however, long rates are rising on expectations of aggressive fiscal policy under President Donald Trump. The widening gap between rates in the two countries is contributing to a weaker yen. \nTrump on Jan. 31 blamed the U.S. trade deficit on money supply policies in foreign countries, singling out China and Japan as guiding their currencies lower. \n\"If the money supply continues to increase due to the BOJ's large-scale JGB purchases, Trump may step up his criticism of Japan,\" said Yasunari Ueno of Mizuho Securities. \n(Nikkei)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T20:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:22:15.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
