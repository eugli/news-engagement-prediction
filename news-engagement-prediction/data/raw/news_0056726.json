It’s a great opportunity to learn, develop, and excel within the gaming industry. We are a diverse team that welcome everyone with a can-do attitude and a sense of fun. The company language is English but we have more than 25 languages (including Quenya) represented across our two offices in Stockholm and Umeå, Sweden. \nAt Paradox Interactive we come from many different backgrounds and all have very different experiences. Some of us came here with fresh degrees in programming or engineering, some with many years in the games industry and some with just great skills, attitude and a passion for making games. Together we make the best games we can possibly make while having great fun! A big family \nOur Paradox family includes more than just employees, we have a big network of loyal fans, 25+ external development studios and long-term sales partners who contribute to our success. We make our own decisions \nWe control our operations and make our own decisions, and we are not dependent on outside funding or lengthy approval processes. Have fun \nOur corporate culture includes hard work and dedication but also Friday After Work, a strong board game community and team activities within and outside the company. Responsibility & Freedom \nEven though you’ll be responsible for your specific part of our production chain, your contribution counts and you’ll see direct results of your input in our final products. At Paradox we provide you with freedom and responsibility to meet your goals. We offer flexible work hours, an open office environment and we encourage sharing and learning from each other. Who we are \nWe are PASSIONATE and care about our gamers, our products and our colleagues. \nWe are COMMITTED and work hard to keep our fans happy. \nWe are CHALLENGERS and thrive on the front lines and on our way into the unknown. \nWe are RESPONSIBLE, learn and improve from our mistakes. When we see a problem we don’t ask whose fault it is, but see ways we can help fix it.
