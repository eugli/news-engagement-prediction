Apparatus being one of the city’s more buzz-worthy design firms meant that this was one silent auction that did not disappoint. There were some pretty exceptional objets up for grabs, ranging from jewelry to funky chairs to perfectly designed side tables, with offerings from Eva Fehren, Jennifer Fisher, Marc Jacobs, and Loeffler Randall in the mix. The party drew in aesthetes of all sorts, including Bergdorf Goodman’s Bruce Pask; Sylvie Millstein of Hellessy; Adam Selman and his partner, stylist Mel Ottenberg; designer James Huniford; Kola House co-owner Lisle Richards; and Darroch and Michael Putnam, the couple behind floral design firm Putnam & Putnam. Athena Calderone in particular—in a funky embroidered Oscar de la Renta skirt and top—was on the hunt for something to bring home. Her new Brooklyn townhouse is currently undergoing a gut renovation, to be completed this fall. She and Eva Fehren designer Eva Zuckerman shared a moment debating the merits of wide-plank versus herringbone hardwood floors, and ultimately agreed to disagree. “It’s hard work doing all this stuff, but I really love it,” said Calderone. Although it might have seemed like an evening of people brought together by their shared love of design, what really got this group together was their support of the Center. As the Center’s executive director, Glennda Testone, explained to us, Apparatus founders Gabriel Hendifar and Jeremy Anderson approached her about doing a fundraiser and more or less made it happen. Testone was touched that so many people came out to support the Center’s mission. “Now, more than ever, we need to create safe spaces for LGBTQ people,” she told us. “Being here together tonight, all this love we are generating, is what matters.” Recommended For You ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:30:39.957+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
