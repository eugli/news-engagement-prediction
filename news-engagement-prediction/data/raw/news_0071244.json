Over the years he’ll be really good. \n“He just needs to talk up a little bit more. He’s a quieter halfback. The skill and the way he competes at training is really good. I see a heap of potential in him.” \nHaving spent the last nine years playing alongside the game’s premier halfback Cronk, Proctor knows a thing or two about what it takes to succeed as an NRL playmaker. \nProctor admits he sees certain Cronk traits in Elgey but the youngster has a few tools the Test star doesn’t. \n“Coops is pretty loud and pretty direct. If he gets his talk up (he could be like Cronk),” he said when comparing Elgey to Cronk. \n“Kane is a little bit off the cuff too and Coops is more structured. He doesn’t really like to go outside of his comfort zone with that sort of stuff. He likes to stick to the game plan and that’s what works for Melbourne and him.

He’s got some similarities.” \nSince leaving the Storm for a long-term deal with the Titans at the end of last year, Proctor’s transition to the glitter strip has been a bumpy ride. \nAn MCL injury during a training mishap set his pre-season into a spin but he’ll take the field against the Roosters on March 4 when the Titans kick-off their season at home. \n“It was a bad tackle,” he explained. \n“He got the knee in the wrong spot and he probably shouldn’t have dived. It was an accident. Those things happen. \n“It was a four to six week injury and it’s (five) weeks now. I’d like to strap it all year now just as a precaution.” Kevin Proctor at Titans training. Source: News Corp Australia \nProctor is expected to be named co-captain alongside Ryan James this week with his leadership qualities a major factor in why he was brought to the club. \nAs part of the pitch from coach Neil Henry, Proctor said the plan is to “lead some of the young guys around and try and show them some of the cultures that we had in Melbourne”. \nJames was a name brought up during that conversation, with the forward ready to take the next step in his career as he pushes for representative honours this year. \nThe other part of the pitch was influencing the club’s culture. \n“It’s that tight bond everyone has together and you get that through training together,” he explained. \n“It starts at training with discipline. Getting everyone to do the little one percenters and teaching the young guys that the one percenters make your team. They help your team out so much. \n“I’ll try and teach them how to get into a good routine, your diet, life outside of footy. \n“You have to get an even balance so you don’t wear yourself out. If I can bring that to some of the younger guys, that’ll help us a lot.” \nDo you live in Queensland? Want to meet a bunch of NRL legends and talk footy with them?
