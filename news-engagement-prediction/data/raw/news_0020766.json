Miller leads the Rangers with 42 points. (David Zalubowski/AP)  48 PM \nJ.T. Miller walked into the Garden on the morning of Dec. 27 after the NHL's three-day Christmas break knowing what was in store for him. It was for the start of that game against the Senators that Alain Vigneault dropped the 23-year-old forward to the fourth line after a 14-game stretch over which Miller produced only three points and a minus-9 rating, not the first time the coach has shown some tough love toward Miller. \nSix weeks later, that night against Ottawa can be seen as a turning point of sorts for Miller, who has been showcasing his excellent play-making ability ever since while making more of the high-percentage plays his coach wanted to see from him at the time of his demotion, which Miller said he responded well to. \n\"I knew I had to be better,\" he said after the Rangers' 4-1 win over Anaheim on Tuesday, in which he had two more assists. \"I went through a 15-20 game stretch where I wasn't creating much, I was forcing plays. You've got to go back and get a wake-up call. Coming into the locker room that morning I knew something was gonna happen. I didn't complain. It's hard at that point, but you've got to put your work boots on and try to get back to being simple, and when that happens things seem to open up. You get confidence and you get rolling.\" \nMiller has been rolling to the tune of 20 points (seven goals, 13 assists) in his last 16 games, seven of those assists coming in the last four games, including two assists in each of the last three. His centering pass set up Michael Grabner's crucial goal 3:45 into the third on Tuesday to put the Rangers up 3-1. \nWith a team-high 42 points, Miller is one shy of his career-high set last season. He had 19 points in his first 22 games before the dry spell. Miller.

Their improvement is a major reason the Rangers, who host the Predators on Thursday, are a better-than-expected 34-18-1. \nIt's also why during games like Tuesday's when Henrik Lundqvist is keeping the Rangers in it despite a massive shot and attempt differential that they can still create a number of quality scoring chances without much possession. \nFor Miller and Hayes, it helps to play with a speedster with a hot stick like Grabner. \"We have really good chemistry as a line, and when we're playing to our strengths it's hard to handle,\" Miller said.
