Times, a video released by ICE showed an agent identifying himself to a deportee by saying, “Good morning, how you doing? I’m a police officer. We’re doing an investigation.” \n“This is especially corrosive given that to advance public safety, LAPD does not initiate police action with the objective of determining a person’s immigration status,” the letter goes on to say. The latest version of the letter. Now addressed to David Marin. pic.twitter.com/5x0qUuMtr6 \n— Claudia Peschiutta (@ReporterClaudia) February 24, 2017 \nIt was signed by Mayor Eric Garcetti, City Attorney Mike Feuer and L.A. City Council President Herb Wesson. \n“In sum, decades of experience by LAPD and City Attorney prosecutors demonstrate the city we serve will be less safe if any member of our large and diverse immigrant population is driven undergound, dissuaded from providing valuable information and cooperation because they fear contact with our own police force.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:08:23.870+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
