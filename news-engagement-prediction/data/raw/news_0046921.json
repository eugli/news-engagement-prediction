New Media Investment Group (NYSE: NEWM), the acquisitive firm that owns GateHouse, said in a regulatory filing today that the company has plans to cut $27 million in expenses this year. But in the same filing, CEO Mike Reed said that with about $200 million in cash and cash equivalents, \"New Media is well positioned to take advantage of more great acquisition opportunities at attractive valuations in 2017.\" GateHouse Media CEO Kirk Davis Suzanne Neace The cuts come as the company, which owns more than 100 newspapers in Massachusetts including the Patriot Ledger and Worcester Telegram & Gazette, reports a 50 percent drop in profit for 2016 â€” to $32 million on $1.3 billion in generally flat revenue. New Media blamed its challenged financial results on the \"further decline in traditional print\" as well as a challenging holiday season experienced by its retail advertisers, which caused lower advertising spending. It's not immediately clear if those cuts would come from its workforce itself, but the company did say that the savings would come from \"synergies from out latest acquisitions.\" GateHouse CEO Kirk Davis did not immediately return a message seeking comment. But the financial pressure won't apparently put a dent in New Media's plans for a newspaper shopping spree. Last year, New Media acquired newspaper including the Columbia Daily Tribune in Missouri; the Rochester Business Journal in New York; and Harris Enterprises, which owns papers in Kansas and Iowa, for $20.4. The company also acquired the publishing division of the Ohio-based Wooster Republican Printing Company for $21.2 million. So far, New Media has spent $735 million buying up newspapers since it was formed in 2014, taking advantage of the flagging value of print newspapers across the U.S. New Media is managed by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group (NYSE: FIG), which announced last week it would be acquired by Japanese multinational firm SoftBank Group for $3.3 billion. New Media's portfolio includes 564 community print publications, 489 websites, 476 mobile sites and six yellow page directories across the country. The company employed 9,509 employees, with about 13 percent of the workforce represented by 35 unions as of Dec. 27, 2015, according to a regulatory filing. Shares of New Media were down about 5 percent on Tuesday to $15.01. David Harris oversees the Boston Business Journal's digital content.
