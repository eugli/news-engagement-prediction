Mr Smith takes the photos from a small fixed-wing aircraft piloted by his friend, Joe Smith (no relation). Speaking to the BBC from \"the middle of a cotton paddock\", Mr Smith said he came up with the idea at a bakery in Sydney. As he looked around, he wondered if other customers knew where their bread was coming from. \"It just dawned on me that there was probably no consideration given to what has gone into producing that bread,\" he said. So he took to the skies, hoping to draw attention to how food and clothing is produced. It was a hobby until 2011, when his aerial shots of floods in Queensland and New South Wales were featured in a major newspaper. Since then he has made it his living, and held an exhibition of his work. \"Here in Australia, we've got farmers producing the highest quality produce anywhere in the world,\" he said. Mr Smith said that when he shows farmers photos of their land, \"it's usually quite a good reaction\". \"I'm trying to put an abstract point of view on what would be a pretty routine process happening on a farm,\" he said. \"The end game for me is producing these series as fine art,\" he said.
