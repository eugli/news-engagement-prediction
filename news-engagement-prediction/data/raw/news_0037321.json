Trump loves rallies; it would be a win for the British public and a win for the Royal British Legion, of which the Queen is patron… The only person who gets screwed is the Speaker of the House of Commons.” \nThe Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has stated that he will attempt to block Trump addressing the Parliament, but the Express ‘ reports, “The President has shrugged off the apparent snub and wants to ‘speak to the people, not politicians.’ ” \nBercow and Parliament were warmly welcoming of Barack Obama during his visit in 2011. \nBercow’s poorly-calculated maneuver has cost him dearly, as speakers are expected to remain neutral in all partisan matters. Members of Parliament are pushing to deliver a vote of “no confidence” in Bercow, and the government has indicated that it will not intercede on his behalf. \nBreitbart also reports that “over recent days, it has emerged that Bercow also backed Remain during the Brexit referendum last summer, while allegations have surfaced that Bercow accepted tens of thousands of pounds’ worth of donations from contacts of Keith Vaz, a Labour MP. Vaz was forced to step down from chairing the Home Affairs Select Committee due to a scandal over drugs and male prostitutes.” \nThere is no official date set for Trump’s visit to Britain, but it is expected to take place in late spring or early summer of 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T20:40:02.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
