(AP) â€” Draymond Green had an uncommon triple-double while scoring only four points, and the Golden State Warriors beat Memphis 122-107 on Friday night for their first win over the Grizzlies in three tries this season. \nGreen had 12 rebounds, 10 assists and a career-best 10 steals, part of a Warriors defense that forced 19 Memphis turnovers and 39 percent shooting. \nKlay Thompson scored 36 points to lead Golden State (45-8). Kevin Durant added 24 and Andre Iguodala had 22, missing only one of seven shots.
