The amount of tuition help will decrease as a student's family income increases, until it reaches a maximum income cut-off point.\nFree tuition for low-income students squeezes middle class, critics say   Students launch complaint against province over bursary program The amount of the grant will also change based on the size of the family, to a maximum family size of seven. \n\"This new program make post-secondary education more accessible … for New Brunswick students,\" said Gallant.\nFamilies that fall under the program include:\nA family of one or two making up to $75,000 a year. A family of three making $90,000 a year a year. A family of four making up to $100,000 a year.  A family of five making up to $108,500 a year. A family of six making up to $116,500 a year. A family of seven earning up to $123,500 a year. \nThe program will be available starting Aug. 1 to New Brunswick students who meet the criteria of the program.\n\nThe new program is an addition to financial assistance programs already offered for New Brunswick students, including the Tuition Access Bursary, which was announced in 2016 to help students with families earning less than $60,000 attend a publicly funded college or university.\nIn 2015, the Gallant government received backlash from the public for cutting New Brunswick's tuition rebate program, which could reach a maximum of $20,000 for graduates who stayed in the province and worked after graduation.\nStudent financial assistance program applications for the 2017-18 school year are expected to be available by June 1.\nGallant also announced the province will provide health-care coverage to international students enrolled and studying at New Brunswick universities and community colleges to help address out-of-pocket expenses.\n\"If we want to grow the economy … the best investment we can make is education and training,\" said Gallant said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:25:12.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
