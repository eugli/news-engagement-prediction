That impact propelled a tire onto a nearby property, police said. \nAn elderly male driver suffered a medical condition that caused a crash in Olds, Alta. on Feb. 3, 2017. \nThe Jeep then destroyed a wooden fence before smashing into a yard and through a detached garage. \nThe vehicle tore off the southwest corner of the residence before crashing through a shared fence with a neighbouring property where it pushed a deck off its supports. \nThe Jeep came to a stop against the southeast corner of an adjacent home. \n“The vehicle is believed to have gone airborne for approximately 20 feet as it mounted over the curb,” RCMP said in a statement Friday afternoon. \nThe couple, in their late 70s and early 80s, had to be removed from the wreckage. They remained in hospital as of Friday night. \nPolice said there was no criminal aspect to the driving and no charges are expected. \n“A medical complication arose for the male driver as the vehicle was westbound and resulted in him being incapable of operating the vehicle,” police said. \nHomeowners in the affected residences were not injured. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:43:55.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
