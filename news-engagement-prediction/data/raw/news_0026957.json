Margaret Credit: Gene Page/AMC \nGregory is adamantly against Rick's plan to attack the Saviors and wants to cut off ties with them entirely, but Jesus reminds him how much Maggie and Sasha have benefited the Hilltop already. \nMaggie already looks at the Hilltop and its people as hers, which bothers Gregory to the point of calling her by the wrong name... again. \nGregory holds fast and the group angrily leaves the meeting, but Enid's been going door-to-door to gather troops for the fight and the Hilltop is so in. \nStill, Rick knows these two groups won't be enough to take down Negan, but Jesus has a surprise up his sleeve... \"You have given the King much to ponder.\" \nThe group arrives outside the Kingdom and Richard and another knight lead them to meet with King Ezekiel. \nThe group spies Morgan and a happy reunion ensues. He informs them of Carol's safety and of her insistence on being alone. \nIn turn, Morgan learns of the sad deaths of Glenn and Abraham. \nRick is amused by the medieval nature of the group but he quickly grows nervous when he finally meets Sheva! \nThe Sheriff presents his plan to Ezekiel, who is not happy about his secret dealings with the Saviors possibly coming to light. \nRichard has been wanting to bring down Negan for a long time and he more than agrees with Rick, but Zeke is more interested in Morgan's opinion. \nThe Zen Master knows a lot of people will die and believes they must find another way, prompting Ezekiel to delay his decision so he can think on it for the night. \nHe promises to give the group an answer by morning. Credit: Gene Page/AMC \nCarol comes across Morgan's knight-in-training, Benjamin, and advises him to go home before dark. \nHe assumes she must need help, too, but she assures him she can handle herself. \nBen offers Carol food and water but she doesn't understand why he would be so helpful to others. \nShe teaches him how to walk quietly and sends him on his way. \nWhen he returns, he finds the King telling his baby brother a bedtime story and informs Zeke of his run-in with Carol before advising him the Kingdom should help the Alexandrians. \nEzekiel has second thoughts about joining the fight, he worries about losing his people in the war. \nHe turns down Rick's request, but offers to allow Daryl a place to hide inside the Kingdom instead. \nDaryl wants to return to Alexandria, but Rick talks him into staying. It's safer, and he can try to change Ezekiel's mind. Credit: Gene Page/AMC \"We're the ones who live.\" \nRick and the group head out and come across a unique roadblock: dynamite. \nBut it's not meant for survivors; it's to protect the Sanctuary from an incoming herd. \nThe Alexandrians make off with the explosives, hoping it will aid them in their fight. \nRick makes sure to direct the herd towards the Sanctuary, knowing the Walkers could be the edge they need. \nMeanwhile, Negan has discovered the death of Fat Joey and the disappearance of Daryl. \nHe sends a search party to Alexandria, but Rick is forewarned thanks to Jesus's walkie-talkie. Credit: Gene Page/AMC A Wild Goose Chase \nThe group makes it back to Alexandria before Simon and the Saviors arrive, but only by about five seconds. \nRick pretends to have no knowledge of Daryl's escape, but Simon insists on dragging the group along on their search for the escapee. \nDuring the hunt for Daryl, the group discovers the pantry has been emptied out completely. \nUnbeknownst to them, a panicked Father Gabriel made off with the rest of their supplies. \nThe search turns up empty and Simon and the Saviors head back home after warning Rick that, if Daryl ever does turn up, the Sheriff is expected to put him down. \nAfter Negan's goons leave, Tobin and Aaron reveal that the Priest has been missing for days. \nThe group seems to have lost faith in the cowardly Father but Rick insists the man has changed. Credit: Gene Page/AMC \nRick discovers a clue to Gabriel's whereabouts and the group prepares to search for the missing Priest. \nEric begs Aaron to stay, but he inevitably leaves with the search party. \nThe group is suddenly surrounded by a large group of survivors with guns, but Rick just smiles. \nLooks like the Sherrif plans to recruit the newcomers. Credit: Gene Page/AMC \nIt seems clear the new group must be the long awaited \"Junkyard Kids,\" but will they be open to teaming up with the rest of survivors, or will Rick have another fight on his hands? \nTune in next week to find out!
