It is apt that the race should be wary of the adage that a rotten apple can spoil the barrel,” he added. \nSultan Nazrin Shah said Malays who continued to be at loggerheads would not be a strong community and Muslims who continued to be in conflict would not be able to uphold Islam. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T15:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T10:18:58.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
