He claims @_iamqueenk found out she was getting evicted while she was visiting him. He says she was trying to convince him to let her stay, but he wasn’t having it. The story intensifies as @KashMoneyKanee recalls her coming to his house on a cab fare she couldn’t pay for to harass him. When @_iamqueenk’s mother gets involved, you know this is getting out of hand.\nOKAY YALL , LETS TALK ABOUT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED....\n— 1017Swervo 🇧🇿 ( @KashMoneyKanee ) February 20, 2017 so @__iamqueenk slid in a nigga dms nshit .. and we get to talking.. texting... face timing err&apos; night nshit .\n— 1017Swervo 🇧🇿 ( @KashMoneyKanee ) February 20, 2017 FIRST OF ALL, WHO GOES ANYWHERE WITHOUT ANY MONEY?

The end.\n— 1017Swervo 🇧🇿 ( @KashMoneyKanee ) February 20, 2017 Twitter was so into the story that there have been imaginary threads telling different perspectives. Probably the funniest one is hearing what parody account @HurtMouse has to say. The running joke here is that @_iamqueenk already thought @KashMoneyKanee was suspect because he had mice in his home. This is too much.\nMy door broke, no food in the fridge, ugly busted hoes walking around the crib with fake bears. A young mouse is fed up cuhh !! pic.twitter.com/ sLphz9FCwb \n— HurtMouse ( @HurtMouse ) February 20, 2017 Their takes on #mousegate:\nthat nigga tried to act surprised when I told him them damn mice was out to get in his house.
