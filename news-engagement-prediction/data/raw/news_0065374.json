Another strong tackle option appears headed to free agency as the broncos have informed Russell Okung they will not be picking up his option \n— Jay Glazer (@JayGlazer) February 23, 2017 \nThe Broncos saw disappointing play from both of their offensive tackles during their 2016 Super Bowl title defense with Okung on the left and a combination of Donald Stephenson and Ty Sambrailo on the right. Okung struggled mostly in pass blocking, ranking 48th among 74 qualified left tackles, according to ProFootballFocus’ figures. \nNFL writers, observers and agents heavily scrutinized Okung’s contract at the time of his signing because Okung negotiated the deal with Denver by himself … and did a pretty poor job. He secured only $5 million guaranteed with a team option in Year 2, leaving himself completely vulnerable to the eventuality he’s now suffered. \nNevertheless, Denver may look to retain Okung on a new deal. At 29 years of age, he should have a healthy number of suitors (hello Jaguars, Giants, Vikings) in a pretty thin market for tackles. Okung should probably get some experienced representation this time around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:22:13.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
