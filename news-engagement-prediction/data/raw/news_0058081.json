Ledo Pizza and a fast-casual barbecue joint are opening in the Jefferson Square at Washington Hill apartment building near Johns Hopkins Hospital . Urban-Bar-B-Que plans to open in early April in 1,800 square feet. The location will be the chain's first in Baltimore and 12th overall. The concept started in 2003 with a location in Rockville and began to expand across Maryland after Ledo Pizza took a minority stake. Urban Bar-B-Que and Ledo Pizza are opening at the Jefferson Square Apartments at… more CoStar Group Inc. Urban-Bar-B-Que concentrates on the Texas, North Carolina and Memphis-style BBQ. \"We take all of the different styles and combined into one location,\" Will Robinson , a vice president at Urban-Bar-B-Que and Ledo's. Urban Bar-B-Que has other Baltimore-area locations in Catonsville, Ellicott City and Linthicum Heights. Ledo, meantime, will open in 2,500 square feet adjacent to the Urban space. Ledo's will have a full bar, while Urban will serve just beer. Ledo is expected to open several weeks after Urban debuts. The restaurants were attracted to the North Wolfe Street space because of its proximity to the busy Johns Hopkins Hospital and the void of restaurants nearby, Robinson said. Anwar Yousuf is the franchisee of both Urban-Bar-B-Que and Ledo's. The 305-unit Jefferson Square apartments opened in 2014. Current first-floor retail tenants are CVS and BB&T.
