Popular US crime writer Patricia Cornwell has spent millions of dollars researching Jack the Ripper (Image: AP Photo/Jim Cooper) \nThree of Sickert's letters sent to friends and two of the antagonistic notes Ripper sent to police were found to have come from a paper run of just 24 sheets, according to scientific analysis conducted by Ms Cornwell. \nThe book also claims to debunk Sickert's alibis and contains claims he would dress up as Jack the Ripper while painting, Daily Mail report. \nMs Cornwell also claims Sickert confessed to a friend that \"he would not mind having to kill and eat raw flesh.\" Ms Cornwell has long asserted that Walter Sickert is Jack the Ripper (Image: Wikimedia Commons) \nSickert is renowned within the British art community for his depictions of sex and sleaze in London at the time. \nThe author has spent millions of dollars investigating the true identity of Jack the Ripper - including more than $3.2 million for 32 of his paintings, some of his letters and his writing desk. \nRipper: The Secret Life of Walter Sickert will be released in Australia on February 28. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 TRENDING VIDEO Emotional football ad celebrates love A US commercial for the NFL Pro Bowl is being praised for its heart-warming message that “Love Has No Labels”.
