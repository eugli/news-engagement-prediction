It was barely a confrontation. Instead, his mother told him calmly and simply that she would not, could not attend. Given the ultimatum by her son — accept all of me as I am, or none of me — she chose the latter, without hesitation.\nmedia_camera Yvonne and Geoff told their son they would not attend his wedding. Picture: Channel 7\nIt was startling viewing. And in an interview with Kyle and Jackie O this morning, Chris revealed some information about his mother’s past that makes her inability to accept her gay son all the more perplexing.\n“Religion gives my mum structure in her life — she found it when she was a bit of a wild child,” he said of his “full-blown Jehovah’s Witness” mother.\n“No-one knows this, but my mum actually used to work in gay bars, back in the day.”\nmedia_camera Chris can't hide his hurt after his parents refuse to attend to wedding or meet his partner of three years.\nYep, you read that right. Kyle and Jackie O couldn’t quite believe what they were hearing — Kyle asking if perhaps Yvonne’s rejection of homosexuality stemmed from whatever same-sex action she witnessed in 1970s-era gay venues.\n“It’s more so about the beliefs, I don’t know that it has anything to do with what she experienced [in gay bars],” Chris said.\nThe couple said that they’ve found theirs is “not a unique story” — attending Sydney’s Mardi Gras Fair Day on Sunday, they said they were approached by many people who’d seen them on Bride and Prejudice and had their own stories of parental rejection to tell.\nChris said he still held out hope his parents would change their minds and attend his wedding, which will take place in the US.\n“Hopefully, [the show] was a bridge we could build with my parents, because it would be great to have them there,” he said.\nmedia_camera Chris and partner Grant (left) will get married, whether his parents are there or not.
