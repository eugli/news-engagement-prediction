Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA Wire The House of Lords \n“But I don’t want to see anyone holding up what the British people want, what the people of Stoke-on-Trent voted for last year, which is for us to deliver Brexit.” \nFor the avoidance of doubt, she added: “[The bill] was not amended [in the House of Commons]. I hope that the House of Lords will pay attention to that.” \nThe PM’s words came as Downing Street played down the amendments threat, stating that that what the Lords does “is a matter for the House of Lords”, adding that MPs passed the bill by a ratio of five to one. \nA No.10 spokesman stressed that the legislation, which will allow May to trigger the formal Article 50 process of quitting the EU, was designed to enact “will” of the people expressed in the EU referendum in June 2016. Christopher Furlong/PA Wire Theresa May visits a pottery factory in Stoke with by-election candidate Jack Brereton \nSome 190 peers, including former Cabinet ministers and diplomats, were due to speak in the two-day Second Reading debate on the Brexit Bill on Monday and Tuesday. \nMay has said she wants to trigger the Brexit process by the end of March, starting a two-year legal journey which will see the UK finally leave the EU by 2019. \nSome MPs and Government sources have warned the Lords that they could face abolition or a flood of new Tory peers if they seek to block the Brexit bill. \nAmong the string of peers expected to speak in the debate was Lord Lisvane, the former Commons Clerk. \nHe told BBC Radio Wales on Sunday that Government sources briefing about abolition of the Lords “appear to be in the grip of powerful medication”. “I think these are very wild threats,” he said, but added that the Lords “could not, should not, would not” overturn the Brexit referendum result. \nLabour’s leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon, said on Monday that her party would not wish to overturn or block the bill, but would try to make ministers think again about key aspects. \nA new ICM/Guardian poll found that on the issue of EU citizens’ rights in the UK after Brexit, voters backed May rather than Labour’s plan for unilateral rights. \nSome 42% of those polled said the Government should not give EU nationals living in the UK the right to stay “until Britons living in other EU countries get the same right” \nA total of 41% of voters said that such citizens should get their rights up front, “because it is the right thing to do and may get negotiations off to a good start”.
