At one stage Julie weighed 150kg. Picture: Caters Source: Caters News Agency \nAfter undergoing a gastric sleeve operation in 2015, the mum-of-four educated herself on healthy food choices and slimmed down to a size 14. \nDespite her incredible transformation, Judith felt tortured by an inner shame after being left with a hideous ‘apron’ of excess skin that she had to tuck into her knickers. \nNow finally, she has the size 12 body of her dreams after spending $50,000 on a full body lift and breast implants, and losing almost 5kg in excess skin. \nJudith said: “My whole adult life I have been big and it’s always got me down. Especially when I had kids as I struggled to run around after them. \n“But I loved the feeling of having food in my mouth. When it wasn’t there, I’d feel restless and upset. \n“Most days, I’d chew on a huge kilo bag of Minties between meals which had double the amount of calories I was supposed to eat in a day. \n“Then I’d make unhealthy food choices, such as eating packets of noodles for dinner and eight Weet-bix and toast for brekkie. \n“I tried dieting but was constantly up and down. It was at my heaviest of 150kg when a photo of me by the beach in Fiji on my honeymoon, made me realise how bad my weight had got. \n“I knew I needed help and eventually my doctor suggested surgery. It changed everything, most importantly my mindset.” Not being able to run around with her children was a major push for Julie to lose weight. Picture: Caters Source: Caters News Agency \n“After having the gastric sleeve operation, I lost almost 70kg and changed the way I ate. \n“But I was left with this unsightly, flappy apron of skin. \n“My once full DD cup breasts were like deflated balloons and I was desperately down and depressed. \n“My now ex-husband saw how badly it was affecting me, and stumped up the $50,000 I needed to have the skin surgery from his super. \n“After surgeons cut off my ghastly apron, I had a body I was extremely proud of.” \nLIFELONG BATTLE \nJudith has always battled with her weight, but it was during her second pregnancy, when she was expecting twins, that the weight really piled on. \n“I was about 90kg when I fell pregnant with my eldest daughter, Jasmyn, 14, when I was 20. By the time I’d given birth to my twins, Jacinta and Harrison, 10, I’d ballooned up to a huge 120kg,” she said. \n“I was wearing baggy size 26 clothes and hated the way I looked. But I had no motivation to do anything about it. \n“After the birth of my youngest, Hunter, now three, I got married. \n“I didn’t bat an eye at waltzing down the aisle wearing a size 28 wedding gown. I was just happy to be getting married. \n“But when I saw a photo of me on the beach on honeymoon, I was horrified. I weighed 150kg and looked like a beach ball.” \nShe lost 40kg after her doctor prescribed an appetite suppressant but when the medication was banned, her appetite came rushing back along with the weight. \nAfter her GP referred her for surgery, Judith began to educate herself on the nutritional aspects of food. \n“My kids were growing up before my eyes and I wanted to make sure they didn’t inherit my terrible food habits,” she said. \n“After my operation, I completely changed what I was eating and instead had lean meats and vegies. \n“Of course, my portions were much smaller too. \n“After nine months, I’d dropped to 79kg. It was amazing to wear a size 14 and I was so proud of myself.” Julie after the surgery to remove 5kg of excess skin.

The operation removed 5kg of excess skin and gave Judith a size 12 body. \n“Without my saggy skin, I feel like I can do anything,” she said. \n“Exercising is so much more enjoyable and I’ve been able to buy a pair of jeans for the first time in my life. Life suddenly seems so much more exciting.” \n“Losing 70kg has changed my life and I’m so happy I can finally be a good role model for my kids, especially as I’ve recently split from my husband. \n“Best of all, I’ve finally beaten my addiction to food. I don’t think I could ever eat another Mintie again.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:17:10.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
