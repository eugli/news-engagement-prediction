(Mario Tama/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday, February 10, 2017, 5:27 PM \nWASHINGTON â€” When Vice President Mike Pence declared that national security adviser Michael Flynn didn't talk to the Russian ambassador about sanctions before President Trump's inauguration, he was repeating what Flynn had told him directly, a source in the Trump administration tells the Daily News. \nPence said in a Jan. 15 appearance on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that Flynn's pre-inauguration contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak had nothing to do with the Obama administration's sanctions punishing Russia for its meddling in the 2016 election. That claim has now been directly contradicted by reports in the New York Times and Washington Post that say Flynn did discuss the sanctions in December, a potentially illegal move. \n\"They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States' decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,\" Pence told CBS at the time. \nAn administration source confirms to the Daily News other reports that Pence was just repeating what Flynn told him directly before the interview, strongly suggesting that Flynn lied to Pence. \n\"The Vice President based his comments following his conversation with General Flynn,\" the source said. \"He spoke to General Flynn in preparation for doing that interview and that's where the basis of that interview came from.\" Flynn has long courted controversy with his close ties to Russia, and the latest controversy has led to demands from many Democrats that he be fired. (JIM LO SCALZO/EPA) \nThe CBS interview has entangled Pence in Flynn's controversy, hurting his reputation as a relatively straight shooter compared to the President himself, who has repeatedly made bold claims without facts to back them up, including boasting about crowd size at his inauguration, claiming millions of people illegally voted in the 2016 election, and misrepresenting the murder rate in recent days. \nNine current and former senior government officials told the Post that Flynn specifically discussed the looming sanctions with the Russian ambassador, with some saying he encouraged Russia not to overreact to the sanctions because Trump might take a different route. \nFlynn initially denied the allegations but later walked that back, telling the Post through a spokesperson \"that while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn't be certain that the topic never came up.\" \nFlynn has long courted controversy with his close ties to Russia, and the latest controversy has led to demands from many Democrats that he be fired.
