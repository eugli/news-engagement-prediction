Matt Ryan, left, and Khalil Mack (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 7:49 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 7:49 p.m. ET \nThe awards keep coming for Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, which he hopes will be an omen for Sunday. \nThe night before Ryan will lead the Falcons on the field against the Patriots in Super Bowl 51, Ryan was named the NFL's Offensive Player of the Year at the annual NFL Honors awards show. \nRaiders pass rusher Khalil Mack was selected as the NFL Defensive Player of the Year. \nMORE: Brady vs. Ryan is the best QB matchup in Super Bowl history \nRyan completed nearly 70 percent of his passes during the regular season for 4,944 yards, 38 touchdowns and just seven interceptions for a 117.1 passer rating as the Falcons went 11-5 to win the NFC South and earn the NFCâ€™s No. 2 seed. Ryan set an NFL record with touchdown passes to 13 different receivers and his 9.3 yards per pass attempt was the highest mark since former Rams quarterback Kurt Warner had a 9.9-yard average in 2000. Ryan's number this season is the best for any quarterback attempting 500 or more passes. He also led the league this season with 13.3 yards per completion. \nWhile Ryan was second to Saints quarterback Drew Brees in passing yards (5,208) and Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers in touchdown passes (40), he was the most consistent of any quarterback and easily had the highest passer rating. \nRyan set franchise records in passing yards, touchdowns, completion percentage and passer rating, which was the fifth-highest in NFL history. \nThe Falcons led the NFL in scoring this season with a franchise-record 540 points. \nRyan was also selected by the Pro Football Writers Association as the league MVP and Offensive Player of the Year. \nMack recorded a sack in eight straight games, a stretch that included three straight games with a sack/fumble. During a 35-32 win over the Panthers, Mack became the first NFL player since 2009 with an interception, sack, forced fumble, fumble recovery and a touchdown in a single game.
