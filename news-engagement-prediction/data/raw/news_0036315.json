I only have to think of my own kids and how angry I'd be.\" \nHe said there was only one reason the nurse called Dr Harper about Gabby's case \"and that was for him to come in\". \nThe hospital made changes after Ms Hampel's death, the inquest heard, but they did not go far enough to prevent Gabby's death. \n\"There needed to be essentially a clinical redesign, it wasn't about protocols because we'd done that and it hadn't worked,\" Dr Palmer said. \nChanges since Gabby's death include a dedicated triage nurse, early warning signs of sepsis for paediatrics was developed and every patient who went to the emergency department is seen by a doctor. \n\"In terms of the practice of medicine which deals with life, it's just so important mistakes are learnt from,\" Mr Cavanagh said. \nHe has retired to consider his findings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T09:48:30.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
