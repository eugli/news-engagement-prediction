Thambidurai This is people's victory, we will carry forward Amma's legacy in the coming days: AIADMK Senior Leader M. Thambidurai We will not let AIADMK go into the hands of few of VK Sasikala's family members: O Panneerselvam. We will continue with our 'dharm yudh' until Amma's rule is established: Panneerselvam.

The Panneerselvam camp has alleged AIADMK MLAs were held at a resort on Chennai's outskirts against their wish. While O Panneerselvam has managed to win over 10 odd MPs and some MLAs, Sasikala has been able to rally the support of an overwhelming majority of AIADMK MLAs. Though Panneerselvam does not have the explicit support of a very large number of MLAs, he has been insisting he would prove majority on the floor of the House if asked to do so.
