We can only imagine the stress and heartache they are feeling.” \nThe rhino orphanage said: “We are still trying to come to grips with the devastating attack on our team as well as the tragic loss of two of our beloved rhino orphans, Impi and Gugu. \n“Thank you for the overwhelming support and our apologies if we are slow at responding to comments and messages. \n“Our team is still on full alert with additional protection measures being implemented to ensure the safety of the staff and calves still in our care. \n“The remaining rhino orphans and Charlie are all doing well and we are sticking to our normal schedules to minimize any further disruptions that could cause them stress.” \nThe centre added: “In the coming weeks we will keep all our followers informed of the situation. Let’s all stand strong, calm and united in the face of this tragedy.” \nIt is understood that authorities have arrested three people in connection with the incident.
