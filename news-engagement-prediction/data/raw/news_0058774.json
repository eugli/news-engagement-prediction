Rupert Jones, deputy commander of Operation Inherent Resolve, offered a more muted assessment of the situation on the ground, telling CNN's Christiane Amanpour the airport was \"reasonably well-secured.\" \"It's been a really good day,\" said Jones, speaking from Baghdad on Thursday. \"The Iraqis are on the airfield. It looks reasonably well-secured.\" \"We should just be a little bit patient. It will really be for the Iraqis to say for certain once they're confident they're holding it,\" he added. Iraqi forces launched a new bid to retake the western parts of the city on Sunday after declaring in late January that the east had been liberated. Federal police and rapid response forces, backed by drones and heavy artillery, advanced from several positions to storm the airport, Lt. Gen. Raid Shakir Jaudat said in a statement. ISIS has held the airport since 2014 and has largely destroyed its infrastructure. Sources have told CNN in recent months that ISIS has sabotaged the airstrip there to prevent its use. Forces took the airport in a few hours and appear to be moving swiftly, taking back control of two villages -- Yarmouk and Tal al-Rayan -- near the airport and the al-Ghazlani camp. They have also taken control of an ISIS weapons storage warehouse, former ISIS headquarters and the barracks at al-Ghazlani, Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasoul, a spokesperson for the Iraqi operation, told CNN. But the push to take western Mosul is expected to take some time -- the east of the city took more than three months to take from ISIS control.

CNN went aboard an Air Force plane and met two residents of the east who had written some of the letters. One, Ghassan Mohammed Saadoun, said that he had received similar reassuring letters from other Iraqis when the east was being liberated. He said ISIS had tried to confiscate those letters. \"I have lived that experience and seen these letters and leaflets, but ISIS tried to prevent us from seeing them as much as they can. When that happened, the children of ISIS went out into the streets and collected these letters early in the morning hours so no one could read them,\" he said. One of the letters read: \"Do not be afraid of the security forces -- they are coming to protect and to liberate you from injustice. Collaborate with them and don't be afraid of them. They are your sons. We wish you safety and security.\" The offensive to retake Mosul began in October in an extraordinary union of Iraqi troops and militia representing minority ethnic and religious groups that have often stood on opposing sides in Iraq's history.
