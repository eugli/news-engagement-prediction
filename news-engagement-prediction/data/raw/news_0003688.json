Rhoderick Armamento, Quezon provincial police director, said the suspects, all of them men led by their operator, John Lloyd Carlos, 32, were performing sexual acts in front of computer cameras when operatives from the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) raided a two-story house in Saint Jude Village II at 1 a.m. \n“The bedroom was arranged to look like a five-star hotel [suite] to lure their international clients,” Armamento said in a telephone interview. ADVERTISEMENT \nHe said closed circuit television cameras were installed in the house. \n“An informant tipped off the cybersex operation when I [assumed as provincial police director in] November. Since then, we have been monitoring the operation to develop the case,” said Armamento. \nAuthorities, armed with search warrant, seized two desktop computers with cameras and several sex toys that the suspects used in their online shows for their foreign customers, mostly from Europe and Asia. \nCarlos, a tourism undergraduate, said he started as a cybersex worker in 2011. He said he was enticed to start his own cybersex operation two years ago because he earned easily. \nRELATED STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T09:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T04:17:34.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
