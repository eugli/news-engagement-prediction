No one from the Oil Kings has contracted the mumps.\nIn Ontario, Toronto is seeing a surge, with 14 cases linked to bars in the city’s downtown core.\nAHS said the virus is easily spread in crowded environments.\n“There are a number of ways it can be spread,” Dr. Chris Sikora with AHS said. “One of the ways is through contact, if we touch infected items and then touch our mouth, nose and mouth, we can contract the illness, just like influenza.”\nThe illness is preventable by vaccine – it is usually administered to patients at 12 months, and again between 4 and 6-years-old.\n“There shouldn’t be any increased risk to the public, overall,” Dr. Sikora said. “But again, we’re reminding people to know their immunization status and to take those extra precautions.”\nSymptoms of the mumps include fever, aches and swollen facial glands, anyone concerned they may have caught the virus is asked to call Health Link at 811.\nWith files from Carmen Leibel \nRelated Links AHS - Information on Mumps MyHealth Alberta - Information about Mumps", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:36:29.672+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
