Counter-protests are also expected. \nOrganizers say the taxpayer dollars that go to Planned Parenthood should instead be funneled to other health care providers that better serve women and don't offer controversial abortion services. \n\"The money that they get from the government helps them to keep their operations going, and it provides a (mechanism) to provide abortion so they can continue the myth that they're a general healthcare provider,\" said Eric Scheidler, a co-director of #ProtestPP. \n\"Abortion takes the life of an innocent unborn child struggling to exist, and Planned Parenthood is the nation's largest abortion provider.\" \nSisters MacKenzie, Madeline and Meredith Fortener, ages 23, 22 and 26 respectively, left to right, of Wyandotte, Mich., rally to end abortion at the March for Life Friday, Jan. 27, 2017 in Washington, D.C. (Photo: KEN CEDENO, TNS) \nRuth Lednicer, director of media and communications for Planned Parenthood of Michigan, called the rallies misguided. She noted that no federal dollars can be used for abortions, and that the health centers offer other services like cancer screenings and birth control. \n\"The idea of cutting off Planned Parenthood to the thousands of people who depend on us (because of) a service that is not federally funded, it seems short-sighted,\" she said. \nThe anti-abortion movement has political momentum on its side. Majority Republicans in the House and Senate would like to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood, which provided more than a third of the nation's abortions in 2014. They also hope to ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. President Donald Trump has pledged to sign both measures if they reach his desk. \nOne of Trump's first acts after taking office a few weeks ago was to sign an executive order banning U.S. aid to foreign groups that provide abortions. \nRead more:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:11:37.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
