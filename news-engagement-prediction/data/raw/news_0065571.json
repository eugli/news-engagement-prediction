Due emphasis was laid on showcasing the rich heritage of the rulers of Amaravati. \nThe meeting discussed the names that could be given to the buildings and roads, particularly the nine thematic cities, and other relevant issues. \n“We intend to draw inspiration from the designs of the past, but there is no need to copy them,” Mr. Prabhakar observed. \nVentilation \nTTD’s Sri Venkateswara Museum director V. Ranganayakulu said the courtyards of government offices should be like ‘manduvas’ that existed in houses long ago. Such structures would have plenty of air and ventilation. \nSome of the suggestions that came up during the deliberations were that the building tops should be like Sanchi Stupa, the Assembly building should resemble Chandragiri Fort, and the front elevations should highlight aspects of Buddhism. \nAnother proposal was that the Undavalli caves should be properly protected and reinforced. \nDirector of Culture D. Vizia Bhaskar, retired SVU professor Kiran Krant Chowdary, adviser Amareswar Galla, retired ASI officer K.V. Rao, and film art director Anand Sai participated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T06:55:44.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
