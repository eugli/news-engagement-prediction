SpaceX founder Elon Musk said the mission would take approximately a week. \nThere will be no landing on the surface. \n\"This presents an opportunity for humans to return to deep space for the first time in 45 years and they will travel faster and further into the Solar System than any before them,\" the company said in a statement.

SpaceX said the people paid \"a significant amount of money\" for the moon trip. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 27, 2017 \nLift-off will be from Kennedy Space Center's historic Pad 39A near Cape Canaveral – the same launch pad used by the Apollo program for its lunar missions. \n\"Like the Apollo astronauts before them, these individuals will travel into space carrying the hopes and dreams of all humankind, driven by the universal human spirit of exploration,\" SpaceX said. \nThe company suffered a blow when its Falcon 9 rocket exploded while being fuelled on a launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station last year. \nNo one was on board the rocket, and there were no injuries. But the blast touched off a massive fireball and caused extensive damage, including the loss of a commercial satellite.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:04:18.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
