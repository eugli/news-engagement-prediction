The game was lost, he was sure. “This is over,” one Globe columnist, who shall remain nameless, tweeted; Waters’s wife, Suzanne, decamped for the bedroom.\nAdvertisement\nWaters left the TV on, but turned his attention to Twitter, where he found an endless supply of political news to divert the path of his fury. Monday, the dyed-in-the-wool Democrat said, “was going to be an awful lot like the day after the election.”\nThen it was 28-9. Then 28-12 . . .\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Sign By the time running back James White plunged into the end zone for the game-tying touchdown, Suzanne was storming back downstairs and the Patriots had reclaimed Waters’s Twitter feed, where he shared a video of a cat bringing another cat back from the dead via CPR: Resurrected!\nFind a fan who says they never had a doubt on Sunday night, and you’ve likely found a liar. But how many fans were so dismayed by the first 40 minutes of Sunday’s Super Bowl that they abandoned ship? Few will admit to that.\nFor diehards, desertion is the highest form of treason. The greatest derision on social media in the hours after the game was reserved not for the charred remains of the Atlanta Falcons defense, but for those self-described Patriots’ fans who’d “given up.”\nAdvertisement\nCall it the “No True Patsman” fallacy: Anyone who lost faith in Tom Brady isn’t a “real fan,” the world’s most ridiculous sports argument goes.\n“I think most of us have learned our lesson by leaving Red Sox games early,” said Jodi Beggs, a Cambridge economist, responding to a question on Twitter.\nAnd though fans were caught filing out of Fenway when the Red Sox were down 7-0 to Tampa Bay in the 2008 playoffs, abandoning the team only to hear about the ending in the morning is a mistake you only make once, Beggs said.\nPity those famous enough to be caught on camera while fleeing the wreckage.\nThere was President Donald Trump, who reportedly abandoned his Super Bowl party when the game appeared out of hand. But Trump’s status as an authentic Patriots fan, rather than just someone with a few high-placed pals, is a matter of some dispute. And any casual fan or disinterested observer could of course be forgiven for switching over to “Young Pope” or whatever.\nBut what about Mark Wahlberg, whose Patriots bona fides are not in question? If he transformed into an empty seat and left the stadium early, surely there were a few televisions around Boston turned off in disgust.\nWahlberg later said his son wasn’t feeling well, though a quick search of social media found several fans who were feeling pretty bad themselves.\n“28-3 haha so [expletive] embarrassing,” Justin Rumrill of Somerville tweeted just before 9 p.m. The next touchdown — and missed extra point — did nothing to raise his spirits.\nBut then, as things began to change, Rumrill demonstrated the versatility of well-wielded swear words.\n“Holy [expletive],” he tweeted.\nThen, 20 minutes later: “Holy [expletive] [expletive].”\nBy midnight, he was happily eating crow (or Falcon, as it were):\n“When it was 28-3,” he wrote , “I gave up and lost faith. Once again Tom Brady and the Pats proved me wrong.”\nHe even broke out the emojis: five rings.\nNestor Ramos can be reached at nestor.ramos@globe.com .
