Maher, astonishingly agreed, saying, “that’s not unreasonable.” The host asked panelist and former Republican congressman from Georgia Jack Kingston, “where do you stand on weirdos peeing?” \nAfter Wilmore and “Overtime” panelist counter-terrorism expert Malcolm Nance attacked Yiannopoulus, Maher asked him why he always had to fight with people. “We were having such a nice time, but you always invite such awful people on your show, they’re so stupid,” he whined to Maher. “You need to start inviting higher-IQ guests.” \nWilmore responded that Nance could “talk circles around your pathetic, douchey little ass.” \nThe men mostly smiled or chuckled through the parries and Kingston urged Yiannopoulus on, saying, “Milo, for it, Brother.” \n“Are you the real, true face of the alt-right?” Nance asked at one point. “I thought the Nazis were in there, how did they take you on board?” \nYiannopolous responded that they hate him. “The worst people on the very far left and the very far right all hate me,” he added. \nWilmore quipped, “I think you’re leaving out a lot of people.” \nMaher advised Yiannopoulus to tone down his rhetoric — not just for the show but in general. “Look, this is the beginning of your career,” he said. “People are just starting to hate you. You remind me of a young, gay, alive Christopher Hitchens, but you gotta lose that kind of shit.” \nTwitter, meanwhile, wasn’t particularly happy about Maher’s gentle treatment of his guest earlier on “Real Time,” when the two seemed to get on famously and Maher never held Yiannopoulus’ feet to the fire. Others were simply outraged he was invited to begin with.

I'm disappointed in @billmaher for comparing him to the great Chris Hitchens #RealTime — Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) February 18, 2017 @ColMorrisDavis @RealTimers @billmaher I saw who was on and turned it off.
