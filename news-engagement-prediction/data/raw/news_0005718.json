Gary Bobrovitz reports. \nRandall Hopley eventually pleaded guilty in the case and was sentenced to seven years in jail. \nHe was also deemed a long-term offender after court heard of his long list of prior offences. \nREAD MORE: Special coverage of Kienan Hebert's kidnapping \nAccused child abductor Randall Hopley is led out of the Cranbrook, B.C. courthouse on September 14, 2011. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Bill Graveland \nNo hearing was actually held for Hopley, but the law allows for offenders to automatically have their detention reviewed for possible early release. \nAccording to documents obtained by News Talk 770, the Parole Board of Canada has ordered Hopley to remain in custody. \nIn its decision, the board highlighted that Hopley remains a high-risk to reoffend, doesn’t take responsibility for his actions and refuses to undergo a psychological assessment. \n“You continue to blame others for your offending and have not accepted responsibility for your behaviour,” the decision read. “You do not have the support of your CMT (case management team) for any kind of release at this time.” \nIn the decision, the board noted a “substantial degree of indifference” towards the consequences to others affected by his crimes. \nHopley provided no comments to the parole board before a decision was made, adding only that he wanted a written decision because of the anxiety and stress associated with an in-person hearing. \nKienan Hebert with family \nHopley’s mandatory release is set for November 2018, but he would still be subject to supervision for 10 years because of the long-term offender status. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
