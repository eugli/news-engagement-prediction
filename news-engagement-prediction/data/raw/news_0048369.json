Courtesy ABC News 24. \nThe first is that consumers were taking their own control, he told the conference. \n\"The second is the increase in energy costs we have seen in recent times â€“ with only an all-too-brief respite thanks largely to the repeal of the carbon tax,\" he said.

Photo: Peter Rae \nCanberra has recently tagged \"unrealistic\", state-based, renewable energy targets for soaring prices and lower reliability, but Mr Frydenberg said a shift to new technology at the consumer level - \"distributed generation\" - would help. \n\"This could be as simple as changing their retail plan, or might involve them investing in solar PV, storage, or energy productivity measures,\" he said. Advertisement \nIt came as the opposition scoffed at the suggestion that anyone would invest in new coal generation and as the French operator of Victoria's soon-to-be-mothballed Hazelwood brown-coal power station said it had received no offers to take it over. \n\"I don't know, someone might give you a dollar for it, but I don't see anyone wishing to acquire Hazelwood to run it as we have,\" Jim Kouts, Engie's corporate affairs director told a Senate hearing. \nAsked whether the ageing power station would be a good investment for another company, he replied that if he were on the board of another company he wouldn't be putting its money in. \nEngie continues to operate the more efficient Loy Yang B power station in Victoria, which it is trying to sell because it wants to exit coal worldwide. \nThe government is now awaiting the finding of its Finkel Review into energy policy, for which public submissions were extended on Monday due to high public interest. \nOne of those submissions, from the umbrella body Lock the Gate, representing rural landholders, communities and conservation groups, argued that the means of extraction was crucial to ordinary people in the bush. \n\"A blueprint for policy actions to manage the transition must address mining and supply issues including energy and water demand by mining and the social, environmental and economic damage that it does,\" it said. \n\"The damage that energy resource extraction does to land, water and the social fabric of rural Australia no longer makes sense when electricity in particular can so easily and cheaply be generated by renewable sources and stored for large-scale use.\" \nAs well as admitting that cutting carbon tax had provided only fleeting respite for households, the government also back-tracked on its past strong objections to using tax-payer funds for expensive energy projects unable to attract private capital. \nMr Frydenberg is now considering amending the Clean Energy Finance Corporation's mandate to allow it to invest in the next generation of coal-fired power stations, in a marked change of heart from past objections to political interference in the market and the increased exposure of public finances. \nThe government had also cautioned against having taxpayers' money risked on technologies not supported by commercial markets. \nIn his speech to federal Parliament during the 2012 debate to set up the CEFC, Mr Frydenberg said governments should steer clear of \"picking winners\" in the energy industry. \n\"The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will saddle Australian taxpayers with a huge financial burden as billions of dollars are wasted on uncommercial projects in the coming years,\" he said. \n\"By setting up this $10 billion fund to pick winners and assist technologies that the commercial markets will not support, they are basically saying to other players in this market who are existing under the funding constraints that we currently have: 'You will be disadvantaged'. \n\"What is more, with this bill currently before the House there is scope for unwarranted ministerial direction in pursuit of political not commercial goals. There is the potential to distort the existing renewable energy market to the disadvantage of those players operating under the current constraints.\" \nMr Frydenberg has also repeatedly talked about how coal use will inevitably continue to come down in Australia. \n\"The Australian economy is in transition. We are moving away from coal and that is not a bad thing,\" he told the ABC in July.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T14:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T09:24:57.864+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
