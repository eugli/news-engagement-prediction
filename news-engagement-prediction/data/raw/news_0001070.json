In the same row. My frame of reference was Philadelphia, near where I grew up, whose — what’s the right word here? — zealous fans in analogous circumstances would never accept such apathy, or what I perceived as such. Season after season, the Braves won their division, destroying the Phillies, and this is how their fans responded? \n  “Are we as rabid and overtly die-hard like Boston or New York? No, we could be better,” Gavin Godfrey, a native Atlanta journalist who chronicles culture and sports , said over lunch in Castleberry Hill, a historic arts district by the Georgia Dome. “But that doesn’t mean we don’t care, and not every town has to be held to that standard. Not every city’s built the same.” In the Northeast, for instance, with a deep and abiding sports culture that spans generations, and in some cases centuries, there is less competition for sports fans’ loyalty. The emotional connection with college football, for instance, is not as strong as it is with some professional sports. For years, the opposite has been — and to a degree, still is — true of Atlanta, where on autumn Saturdays fans pack bars and living rooms, or flee for Georgia, Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, South Carolina, Tennessee, all within a three-hour drive.

The Falcons have built a base of loyalists — the City Council president, Ceasar Mitchell, said he drove down to Miami for the Falcons’ last Super Bowl appearance despite not having a ticket — but so struggled to pack the Dome that home games were not shown on local television because of the N.F.L.’s old blackout rule. The team’s middling history has also failed to entice the local residents and persuade the newcomers to come out. The arrival of the quarterback Michael Vick , in 2001, mirrored the city’s spirit at the time — ascending, vibrant and hip-hop forward — and his downfall, for his involvement in an interstate dogfighting ring, created tension, on a racial and cultural level, that lingered for years. Vick’s successor, Matt Ryan, is his antithesis in nearly every possible way — be it race, playing style, pedigree or personality. “Some of our fans will always be proud that an African-American quarterback succeeded,” Hertz said. “What I think has happened over a period of time is a growing appreciation and acceptance in Matt Ryan, and that his style is every bit as spectacular on and off the field.” The city’s evolution, coupled with an effort by the owner of the Falcons, Arthur Blank, to promote a sense of community around the team, has strengthened its bond with the Falcons.

Credit Photographs by Dustin Chambers for The New York Times Since 2012, when the Falcons lost in the conference championship game, the Georgia Dome, which seats 71,250, has achieved at least 98 percent of its season-long capacity every year. This season’s mark of 98.2 percent, 15th among the 32 teams and the lowest since 2011, bested that of, among others, the venues for the Giants, Jets, Chiefs and Patriots. As the Braves bolt northwest for a new stadium in Cobb County, a move that has left many fans feeling betrayed, the Falcons remain moored to Atlanta. Next season they move into a new home, Mercedes-Benz Stadium. \n  “There’s something about the nature of fans here that makes them take pride,” said Molly Slavin, 29, who moved here in 2012 from Illinois. “Although it might not be in a way that translates to sports fandom as seen in other cities.” Ryan Cameron, 47, an Atlanta radio personality and a season-ticket holder since 1998, explained that phenomenon like this: “There are people who will fight you about these Falcons,” he said. “But we’re not trying to prove to you that we’re so crazy. For us, it’s just being loud. We don’t have to brag.
