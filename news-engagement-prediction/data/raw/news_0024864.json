By Pooja Nayak | Published: February 8, 2017 6:11 pm 5 times Karan Johar and Kajol gave us friendship goals \nYou know those times when your hair just refuses to listen to you? Even worse if you have just walked out a salon and the wind tries to give you an all new hairdo! Well, Sridevi’s daughter Jhanvi Kapoor had one such trouble last evening; perhaps making us believe that even she belongs to one of us and there’s more to always being fashionably correct. One look at the above picture and you will know what we are trying to say. Looking nothing extra-ordinary in her casual tracksuit, Jhanvi was heading home after a gym session when the papz caught her midway. But her hair made sure they play the perfect distraction. Although she tried putting it behind her ear but who can stop one from flirting with such a gorgeous face? (We are still talking about Jhanvi’s hair!) Also read : Jhanvi Kapoor and Khushi Kapoor to meet Kendall Jenner? \nNevertheless, we are totally crushing on Jhanvi’s natural glow in these pictures. I mean, tell me when was the last time you saw Jhanvi without makeup or without flaunting her designer wear? You might make us count Jhanvi’s airport outings but that again is always so planned with well picked outfits. Take for instance the last time when Jhanvi paired her crop-top with black pants, flaunting her sexy midriff. No complaints though, coz for all that we know, Jhanvi is making her every appearance count mainly coz she is gearing up to make her much awaited Bollywood debut and very well knows how she is constantly under the scanner. But these candid pictures of a simpleton Jhanvi is such a delight. Dunno about you but I feel sometimes the makeup just adds on to make you look mature than your actual age. \nJust in case you didn’t know, Jhanvi is most likely to be seen in the Karan Johar’s Hindi remake of Marathi film- Sairat. Father Boney Kapoor too had confirmed the same stating, “Yes, Karan has been talking to us about a film for Jhanvi and we’ve given consent. But we don’t know which project it would be. Since Karan has recently acquired the remake rights of Sairat it is being presumed that our daughter would be launched in this project.” \nAll said and done, what are your thoughts about these above pictures?
