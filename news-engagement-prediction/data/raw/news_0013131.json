Erik Gonsalves, Thunderbird No. 8, who will be in the stadium helping coordinate the timing. \nGETTING READY: Lady Gaga dances in a bra during sexy sneak peek at halftime show \nOn Friday, the Thunderbirds met with Super Bowl LI singers to measure the length of their performances. Before Bryan sings the national anthem, original \"Hamilton\" cast members Phillipa Soo, Renée Elise Goldsberry and Jasmine Cephas Jones will perform a rendition of \"America The Beautiful.\" \nOn Saturday afternoon, they practiced flying over NRG Stadium. Gonsalves had said ground coordinators planned to toss a few curve balls at the Thunderbirds just in case \"Luke Bryan really gets in the moment and starts drawing out some of those stanzas.\" \nBut overcast skies limited the Thunderbirds to one flyover with no curve balls. \nFor the big game, the Thunderbirds will take off about a half-hour before the national anthem and make large, left-hand turns in an area 25 to 35 miles south of the stadium. It will take them about four minutes and 30 seconds to get to the stadium, so they will begin that flight during the middle of \"America the Beautiful.\" \nRELATED: Law enforcement eyes will be in sky over stadium area \nGonsalves will be inside the stadium with the production team and production studios. Three additional Thunderbirds will be on the stadium's roof to communicate with the six pilots flying the F-16s. \nThis is Gonsalves' first Super Bowl, and he gets to stay to watch the game. All 12 Thunderbird officers will be recognized during the game. \n\"I'm really excited,\" Gonsalves said. \"It's such a cool opportunity, and what an honor to be able to come out here and do this.\" \nThe Thunderbirds are officially called the U.S. Air Force Air Demonstration Squadron. Their mission is to plan and present precision aerial maneuvers to exhibit the capabilities of modern, high-performance aircraft and the degree of skill required to operate those aircraft.
