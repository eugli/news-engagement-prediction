The Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre (MBRSC) announced that Nayif-1 has transmitted its first message in Arabic from space, a quote by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. \"The renaissance of peoples, nations and civilizations starts with education; and the future of nations starts at their schools.\" - His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Ground stations all over the world that operate on amateur radio bands were able to receive the message. The message was transmitted from Nayif-1's ground station, located at the American University of Sharjah (AUS), under the supervision of a team of engineers from MBRSC and university professors, as well as MBRSC's knowledge transfer partner, Innovative Solutions in Space NL. Isro's PSLV lifts off with 104 satellites Nayif-1 is an educational project launched by MBRSC in cooperation with AUS with the goal of providing hands-on experience to Emirati engineering students on designing, building, testing and operating nanosatellites.The nanosatellite Nayif-1 was launched successfully to space on February 15, 2017 on board a PSLV-C37 rocket, from Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, India. Nayif-1's main mission objective is to send and receive messages on Amateur Radio frequencies and stands out as the first 1U nanosatellite that is programmed to transfer text messages in the Arabic language.
