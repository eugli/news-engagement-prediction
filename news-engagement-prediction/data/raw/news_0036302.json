He does rank fourth in the top flight for shots taken, with team-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic top of the charts so far this season. The 23-year-old is also led by two players from north London sides in terms of shots taken - Alexis Sanchez and Christian Eriksen. Both Eriksen and Sanchez are also in the top eight for players who have hit the woodwork this season. But Ibrahimovic is not on the same chart, suggesting he has been considerably more fortunate with his 102 shots in the Premier League - possibly balancing out Pogba's bad luck. Stoke City midfielder Charlie Adam is something of a surprise name on the woodwork list, having hit the post or bar four times in the Premier League this season. Pogba will have a chance to improve his tally when United take on Championship side Blackburn Rovers in the fifth round of the FA Cup on Sunday. But Pogba only ranks fourth in the Premier League for the most shots taken this season RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T17:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T19:24:59.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
