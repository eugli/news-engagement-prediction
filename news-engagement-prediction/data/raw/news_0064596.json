Those freedoms include the right to practice any religion or none at all, the right to speak freely without fear of government interference, and the right to carry guns. \nRelated Story: How Do You Amend the Constitution? \n\"A bill of rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth, general or particular, and what no just government should refuse, or rest on inference,\" said Thomas Jefferson , the author of the Declaration of Independence and the third president of the United States . \nAmendments 1-10 of the Constitution were ratified in 1791.

Amendments 1-10 of the Bill of Rights were predated by the Magna Carta , signed in 1215 by King John to protect citizens against abuse of power by the King or Queen. Likewise, the authors, led by James Madison , sought to limit the role of the central government. Virginia's Declaration of Rights, drafted by George Mason immediately after independence in 1776, served as a model for other state bills of rights as well as the first 10 amendments to the Constitution.Once drafted, the Bill of Rights was quickly ratified by the states. It only took six months for nine states to say yes - two short of the total needed. In December 1791, Virginia was the 11th state to ratify Amendments 1-10, making them part of the Constitution . Two other amendments failed ratification. List of Amendments 1-10 \nHere's an explanation of what Amendments 1-10 say.
