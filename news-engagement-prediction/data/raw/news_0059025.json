By Priscilla Frank Priscilla Frank for The Huffington Post \nThroughout her 70-year career, Japanese artist and almighty priestess of polka dots Yayoi Kusama has created a series of rooms ― mirrored, enclosed spaces that use water, twinkly lights, bespeckled balloons, soft phallic sculptures and pumpkins ― to prompt viewers to contemplate the idea of the infinite universe. \nAnd, from what we’ve gleaned, the infinite universe is very photogenic. Priscilla Frank for The Huffington Post \nOn Friday, Feb. 24, the stunning traveling exhibition “ Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors ” opens at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., featuring six of Kusama’s iconic, infinite spaces. \nViewers are encouraged to enter each space alone, with approximately 45 seconds to take it in once inside. It’s probably a smart idea to sign up for free, timed passes to minimize time spent waiting in lines ― the exhibition is expected to be a blockbuster. \nSince you won’t have boundless time to photograph yourself in the seemingly boundless spaces, you’d be wise to head into the rooms ready to take in the work and take a photo in an expedient manner. And know this: snapping a selfie in the dizzying space is not disrespectful toward Kusama’s mission. In fact, a photo is a simple way to harness the spirit of her rooms ― by multiplying yourself, immersing yourself in your environment, and becoming an infinite image yourself. \nStay tuned for our full review of the exhibition. In the meantime, take a digital walk through the show below, and read more about the exhibition here .
