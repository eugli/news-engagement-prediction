Bey posted a slew of photos from the event on her website today (February 16), which show her husband, Jay Z , and Solange’s hubby, Alan Ferguson, partying the night away. Other celeb attendees included Rashida Jones , Janelle Monáe , Tracee Ellis Ross , and even Beyoncé’s Destiny’s Child sisters, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams . \nQueen B also pulled off her third outfit change of the night, trading in her sequined red Grammys ensemble for a floor-length, cleavage-baring white gown that showed off her growing baby bump. Solange and Rowland, meanwhile, complemented each other in striking red numbers. \nSee all the photos from the A-list affair — as well as behind-the-scenes snaps from the Grammys — on Beyoncé’s website .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:10:10.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
