It won’t affect your breast milk supply and is safe to take while you breastfeed as the tiny quantity of hormone that goes into your breast milk will have no effect on your breastfed baby. \n— This style of contraception can be started straight after the birth of your baby. \n— The combined oral contraceptive pills shouldn’t be used while you breastfeed as they can have an impact on your milk supply. \n— As condoms are a barrier contraceptive, they are a good choice for breastfeeding mothers as they have no impact on your body or your milk supply. \n— Using a diaphragm after birth can be ineffective because of possible stretching of the pelvic floor.
