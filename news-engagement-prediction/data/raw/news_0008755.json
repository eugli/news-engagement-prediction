Kolker’s book, published in 2014, details the world of online escorts and the search for a serial killer who is still at large. \nKevin McCormick and David Kennedy are producing through their Langley Park production company. Pamela Hirsch is executive producing. \nPaulson won the SAG, Emmy and Golden Globe awards for her work portraying prosecutor Marcia Clark in the FX series “The People vs. O.J.Simpson: American Crime Story.” Paulson also stars in “Rebel in the Rye” with Nicholas Hoult, which premiered at Sundance. \nGarbus directed two documentaries that received Oscar nominations —“What Happened, Miss Simone?” and “The Farm: Angola USA.” McCormick’s credits include “Gangster Squad,”“Arthur” and “The Lucky One.” \nPaulson is also part of the ensemble cast of Warner Bros. “Ocean’s Eight,” starring Sandra Bullock, Anne Hathaway and Cate Blanchett. She’s repped by UTA. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:07:28.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
