The most recent one term president who lost his re-election bid was George H.W. Bush , a Republican who lost to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992. \nSee also: 5 Wacky Myths About Obama \nWho are the other one term presidents in the history of the United States? Who are the other modern one term presidents? Why did voters turn their backs on them? Here's a look at America's one term presidents - those who ran for, but lost, re-election - through history. Hulton Archive / Getty Images 1. George H.W. Bush \nRepublican George H.W. Bush was the 41st president of the United States, serving from 1989 to 1993. He lost a campaign for re-election in 1992 to Democrat William Jefferson Clinton , who went on to serve two full terms. \nBush's official White House biography describes his re-election loss this way: \"Despite unprecedented popularity from this military and diplomatic triumph, Bush was unable to withstand discontent at home from a faltering economy, rising violence in inner cities, and continued high deficit spending. In 1992 he lost his bid for reelection to Democrat William Clinton.\" Bettmann / Contributor / Getty Images 2. Jimmy Carter \nDemocrat Jimmy Carter was the 39th president of the United States, serving from 1977 to 1981. He lost a campaign for re-election in 1980 to Republican Ronald Reagan , who went on to serve two full terms. \nCarter's White House biography blames several factors for his defeat, not the least of which was the hostage-taking of U. S. embassy staff in Iran , which dominated the news during the last 14 months of Carter's administration. \"The consequences of Iran's holding Americans captive, together with continuing inflation at home, contributed to Carter's defeat in 1980. Even then, he continued the difficult negotiations over the hostages.\" \nIran released the 52 Americans the same day Carter left office. David Hume Kennerly / Hulton Archive 3. Gerald Ford \nRepublican Gerald R. Ford was the 38th president of the United States, serving from 1974 to 1977. He lost a campaign for re-election in 1976 to Democrat Jimmy Carter , who went on to serve one term. \n\"Ford was confronted with almost insuperable tasks,\" his White House biography states. \"There were the challenges of mastering inflation, reviving a depressed economy, solving chronic energy shortages, and trying to ensure world peace.\" In the end he could not overcome those challenges.

He lost a campaign for re-election in 1932 to Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt , who went on to serve three full terms. \nThe stock market crashed within months of Hoover's first election in 1928, and the United States plunged into The Great Depression . Hoover became he scapegoat four years later. \n\"At the same time he reiterated his view that while people must not suffer from hunger and cold, caring for them must be primarily a local and voluntary responsibility,\" his biography reads. \"His opponents in Congress, who he felt were sabotaging his program for their own political gain, unfairly painted him as a callous and cruel President.\" Stock Montage / Getty Images 5. William Howard Taft \nRepublican William Howard Taft was the 27th president of the United States, serving from 1909 to 1913. He lost a campaign for re-election in 1912 to Democrat Woodrow Wilson , who went on to serve two full terms. \n\"Taft alienated many liberal Republicans who later formed the Progressive Party, by defending the Payne-Aldrich Act which unexpectedly continued high tariff rates,\" Taft's White House biography reads. \"He further antagonized progressives by upholding his secretary of the interior, accused of failing to carry out [former President Theodore] Roosevelt's conservation policies.\" \nWhen the Republicans nominated Taft for a second term, Roosevelt left the GOP and lead the Progressives, guaranteeing the election of Woodrow Wilson.

He lost a campaign for re-election in 1892 to Democrat Grover Cleveland , who went on to serve two full terms, though not consecutively. \nHarrison's administration suffered politically after a substantial Treasury surplus evaporated, and prosperity seemed about to disappear as well. The 1890 congressional elections swept in Democrats, and Republican leaders decided to abandon Harrison even though he had cooperated with Congress on party legislation, according to his White House biography. His party renominated him in 1892, but he was defeated by Cleveland. Stock Montage / Getty Images 7. Grover Cleveland \n*Democrat Grover Cleveland was the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, having served from 1885 to 1889, and 1893 to 1897. So he doesn't technically qualify as a one term president. But because Cleveland is the only president to serve two non-consecutive four-year terms, he holds an important place in U.S. history, having lost his initial bid for re-election in 1888 to Republican Benjamin Harrison . \n\"In December 1887 he called on Congress to reduce high protective tariffs,\" his bio reads. \"Told that he had given Republicans an effective issue for the campaign of 1888, he retorted, 'What is the use of being elected or re-elected unless you stand for something?'\" Stock Montage / Getty Images 8. Martin Van Buren \nDemocrat Martin Van Buren served as the eighth president of the United States, serving from 1837 to 1841. He lost a campaign for re-election in 1840 to Whig William Henry Harrison , who died shortly after taking office. \n\"Van Buren devoted his inaugural address to a discourse upon the American experiment as an example to the rest of the world. The country was prosperous, but less than three months later the panic of 1837 punctured the prosperity,\" his White House biography reads. \n\"Declaring that the panic was due to recklessness in business and overexpansion of credit, Van Buren devoted himself to maintaining the solvency of the national Government.\" Still, he lost re-election. Stock Montage / Getty Images 9. John Quincy Adams \nJohn Quincy Adams was the sixth president of the United States, serving from 1825 to 1829. He lost a campaign for re-election in 1828 to Andrew Jackson after his Jacksonian opponents accused him of corruption and public plunder - \"an ordeal,\" according to his White House biography, \"Adams did not easily bear.\" Stock Montage / Getty Images 10. John Adams \nFederalist John Adams , one of America's Founding Fathers, was the second president of the United States, having served from 1797 to 1801. \"In the campaign of 1800 the Republicans were united and effective, the Federalists badly divided,\" Adams' White House biography reads. Adams lost his re-election campaign in 1800 to Democratic-Republican Thomas Jefferson . \nDonâ€™t feel too sorry for one-term presidents. They get the same nice presidential retirement package as two-term presidents including a yearly pension, a staffed office, and several other allowances and benefits. \nIn 2016, Congress passed a bill that would have cut the pensions and allowances given to former presidents. However, President Barak Obama, soon to be a former president himself, vetoed the bill .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:17:35.132+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
