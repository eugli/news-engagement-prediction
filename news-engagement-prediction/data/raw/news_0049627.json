Lao   \nCEBU, Philippines - Mandaue City Mayor Gabriel Luigi Quisumbing is warning illegal vendors occupying roads and sidewalks that they will be removed on March 6 as they have already caused multiple obstructions to all motorists and pedestrians, aside from affecting the income of legitimate market vendors. \nSome legitimate market vendors have expressed disgust regarding the proliferation of illegal vendors within the vicinity of the public market behind the National Shrine of St. Joseph in Mandaue City who are not only obstructing the sidewalks, but have also affected their income. \nA vendor, who requested anonymity, said the illegal vendors just put up their tables and goods just outside the market, resulting to a lesser number of customers for legitimate vendors with stalls inside the market. \n\"Naa ma'y ubang mamalita'y nga mopalit nalang sa ma'y dalan unya kami lehitimo? Maapektuhan gyud sab among mga baligya,\" a vendor said. \nQuisumbing has also observed the proliferation of illegal vendors and their effect on legitimate market stallholders. \n“These are people that worked very hard but unfortunately naapektuhan gyud ilang income tungod sa mga illegal market vendors,” Quisumbing said.   \nMandaue citizens have also been complaining that most sidewalks are occupied by illegal vendors so pedestrians are not able to pass by smoothly. \nQuisumbing explained that he is not opposed to vendors doing their livelihood, but that he only wants to regulate them and put them inside the market where they can sell their goods in proper stalls and not occupy the sidewalks that are meant for pedestrians. \n“Unfortunately, we will be clearing them by March, all of the illegal vendors in the city of Mandaue but we are currently looking for viable alternatives para nila kay di man sad mi ganahan nga completely mawala ilang income,” Quisumbing said. \nThe mayor said he recognized the plight of legitimate vendors as they follow the laws and regulations of the city, including paying the right taxes and getting their permits properly, but whose incomes have lessened because of the presence of illegal vendors. \nLast week, Quisumbing met with at least 300 market vendors in Barangay Centro as he gave an update on the status of the construction of the new public market. He said the city government is currently rebuilding the new market on the same lot where the old market used to stand in Barangay Centro. \nAccording to Quisumbing, the new public market is set to open in August this year.
