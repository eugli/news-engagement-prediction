Source: Supplied \nDuring the extended break Head and Victorian captain Cameron White met to discuss the options available to both teams after Harris was immediately ruled out of playing any further part in the Shield match.\nVictorian coach and former Australian Test allrounder Andrew McDonald said Victoria formerly requested to replace Harris with a substitute player for the remainder of the match, but was denied by the home team.\nUnder Sheffield Shield rules opposition captains have the ability — in the spirit of the game — to decide if their opposition are able to replace injured players.\nMcDonald diplomatically said Head knocked Victoria’s request back.\n“There was some talk behind the scenes, obviously in extenuating circumstances for a replacement player,” McDonald told ABC Grandstand.\n“That was requested and obviously in the spirit of the game the two captains can get together. Travis Head had a good think about it. Apparently there was some sort of vote in their dressing room and the end result is that we won’t be able to replace that player in that extenuating circumstance, but that ultimately is South Australia’s decision and Travis Head is ultimately responsible for that decision and he felt that it wasn’t going to be passed by him.”\nTravis Head rolling the arm over. Source: News Corp Australia \nThe decision leaves Victoria a batsman down in the second innings and without their primary wicketkeeper for South Australia’s second innings run chase.\nMcDonald said his team’s first priority is the health and welfare of Harris.\nHe said Harris’ severe concussion diagnosis was extremely good news considering recent head blow injuries in cricket.\n“It all looks pretty good for him at the moment.” McDonald said.\n“He’s in the Royal Adelaide Hospital receiving some treatment in there. He’s had CT scan and there’s no bleed or fractures or anything serious like that so at this stage it looks like a severe concussion and he’ll be kept in hospital overnight for observation.\n“It’s a pretty good result for what we thought was a pretty significant blow to the head. It’s obviously, good news.\n“Obviously, he was well treated on the ground and all the correct procedures were followed. Once he got out the back behind the stands everything sort of calmed down a little bit. They stabilised him and things were looking good and there was no significant rush to get him off.\nSam Harper appeared distressed. Source: Supplied \n“At that moment, obviously, players’ minds were flashing here, there and everywhere and it was decided by both captains that a delay was probably best until, particularly Jake Lehmann was ready to continue his innings, until our guys were ready to continue. So common sense prevailed there.”\nVictoria established a 70-run overall lead at tea on day two.\nSouth Australia were 9-168 at the time of Harris’ injury and eventually were dismissed for 178, six runs shy of Victoria’s first-innings total.\nLehmann was the final wicket to fall, caught off the bowling of Jon Holland (4-26) for a match-high 92.\nIn reply, the Victorian opening pair made a solid but unspectacular start, putting on 64 from 23 overs in the second innings.\nTravis Dean was unbeaten on 23 and Marcus Harris was not out 40.\n— with AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T01:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T10:21:26.065+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
