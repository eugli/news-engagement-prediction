Li was found not criminally responsible for the killing. (John Woods/Canadian Press) \nThe man who was found not criminally responsible for a beheading on a Greyhound bus could be given complete freedom after a Manitoba Criminal Code Review Board hearing on Monday. \nVince Li, who now goes by the name Will Baker, has already been living free in the community with some conditions since last year. He killed 22-year-old Tim McLean on a Greyhound bus in 2008. Tim McLean, the young man stabbed to death and beheaded by Vince Li is seen in a photo taken from his MySpace.com personal page. (Canadian Press) \nHe could get an \"absolute discharge,\" depending on what his medical team has to say at his annual review hearing. \nBaker has to go before the Manitoba Criminal Review Board every year, as they determine whether a person who is found not criminally responsible poses a threat to the safety of the public. \nLast year Baker was discharged with some conditions that included taking his medication under supervision, disclosing his address to his medical team, and having no contact with the victim's family. Vince Li's request for more freedom OK'd by Manitoba review board 2:41 Department of Justice fact sheet on NCR \nThe board's other option — if Baker is found not to be a threat to the public — is to grant an absolute discharge. He would no longer be required to attend annual reviews and or abide by conditions. Experts say NCR offenders are unlikely to reoffend . \nIn 2008, Baker was sitting next to McLean on a bus near Portage la Prairie when he repeatedly stabbed McLean and mutilated his body. \nHe was found not criminally responsible because of his schizophrenia . Baker believed he was chosen by God to save people from an alien attack. \nThe not criminally responsible designation has been a fundamental principle of Canada's justice system since 1992 . The accused persons must have the capacity to understand that what they did was wrong — otherwise they can't be found guilty of an offence. \nWill Baker's allowed to: \n2016 : live independently in Winnipeg, with conditions \n2015 : live in a halfway house in Winnipeg. \n2014 : moved to unlocked ward. Allowed unescorted trips into Selkirk, beginning at 30 minutes and working up. \n2013 : supervised visits to Winnipeg and beaches near Selkirk. \n2012 : short, escorted outings from hospital. \n2011: Doctors say Baker could be ready for unescorted walks on hospital grounds within a year. \n2010 : Daily walks on hospital grounds. Click here for a timeline of the events leading up to and directly following the killing. \nEvery change to Baker's conditions seems to prompt controversy, from McLean's family rallying for a law to change NCR rules, to a law professor complaining about meddling politicians. \nMcLean's mother, Carol de Delley, has been outspoken in her belief that Baker should stay locked up.
