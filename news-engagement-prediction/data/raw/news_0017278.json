Susan Sontag was there. Jacqueline Susann was there. So was Philip Roth, and Cynthia Ozick, who asked a mischievous question about Norman Mailer ’s testicles. What was this wild night? A 1971 panel at Town Hall in Manhattan, marketed as a debate on women’s liberation and moderated by Mailer, whose incendiary essay “The Prisoner of Sex” had just filled an entire issue of Harper’s Magazine. The evening was chronicled in “Town Bloody Hall,” a 1979 documentary by D. A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus . And it is now the inspiration for “The Town Hall Affair,” a new piece by the Wooster Group at the Performing Garage, starring Maura Tierney (“The Affair”). Rousing and infuriating, cerebral and vulgar, the original event marked a flash point in second-wave feminism. In this Women’s March moment, it seems newly resonant.

Credit Alex Welsh for The New York Times The Panel Occurring a year after New York had legalized abortion and when equality feminism was giving way to something more revolutionary, this debate, a “Dialogue on Women’s Liberation,” enticed much of the New York literati. Why? Continue reading the main story In 1970, the feminist writer Kate Millett had published an unflattering analysis of Mailer in her book “Sexual Politics,” calling him “a prisoner of the virility cult.” Mailer responded with “The Prisoner of Sex,” in which he savaged Ms. Millett, called his penis “the Retaliator” and ultimately concluded, “The prime responsibility of a woman probably is to be on Earth long enough to find the best mate possible for herself and conceive children who will improve the species.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Millett refused to debate Mailer. So did Ti-Grace Atkinson and Gloria Steinem. Robin Morgan agreed, but only if she could shoot him. Finally, a panel was assembled and the event, which ran three-and-a-half hours, began. After a brief introduction by Mailer, Jacqueline Ceballos, president of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, gave a cogent speech discussing inequalities. The poet Gregory Corso heckled her and had to be ejected. After a cynical question from Mailer, Germaine Greer, author of “The Female Eunuch” and a woman Life would soon call a “ saucy feminist that even men like ,” took the stage. Resplendent in a slinky black dress and ratty fox boa, she read a passionate speech that disparaged “the man of genius” (an implicit dig at Mailer), calling for a return of “the artist who had no ego and no name.” Photo An embrace during the 1971 debate called “Dialogue on Women’s Liberation,” which inspired “The Town Hall Affair.” Credit John Sotomayor/The New York Times Ms. Ceballos recently recalled Ms. Greer, who declined an interview request, as “her usual bored, superior, disdainful self,” and added, “But she was glamorous!” Jill Johnston, an essayist and dance critic for The Village Voice, spoke next. Her talk, somewhere between manifesto and tone poem, began, “All women are lesbians except those who don’t know it naturally.” When she exceeded her time, Mailer tried to cut her off. Instead, two women ran up from the audience to embrace her and the three of them fell to the floor in what Mailer described as a mess of “dirty overalls.” Finally, the literary critic Diana Trilling gave a deceptively fastidious speech that slighted both Mailer and feminist activists while staunchly defending the vaginal orgasm. The Q. and A. session followed, with questions from Friedan, Sontag and the literary critic Anatole Broyard, who asked Ms. Greer to describe women’s sexual requirements after liberation. Ms. Greer declined. “Whatever it is they’re asking for, honey, it’s not for you,” she said. The Film Mailer gave Mr. Pennebaker (“Don’t Look Back”), who had filmed scenes for Mailer’s 1970 mockumentary, “Maidstone,” $3,000 to record the evening. But the Town Hall management did not agree, and as Mr. Pennebaker recalled, speaking by telephone from his home, he spent much of the evening dodging security, finally finding refuge onstage.

It sat on a shelf until Ms. Hegedus, now his wife, took an interest. “For me it was fascinating,” she said, speaking on another line. “These women were some of my heroes in the women’s movement.” She tried to capture the comedy of the event, the seriousness of the arguments, and what she read as the heavy flirtation between Mailer and Ms. Greer. “It seemed like it was some kind of love affair,” she said. (She took the movie’s title from a sardonic remark by Ms. Greer.) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Not many people saw the 1979 film in its first release, though Mailer came to a screening and told Mr. Pennebaker, “This is the night that Jill Johnston turned my hair gray.” Mailer also admitted that at that time, he hadn’t properly understood the women’s movement, Mr. Pennebaker said. For a long time, Ms. Hegedus said, she used to think of “Town Bloody Hall” as little more than a time capsule, a snapshot of a particular cultural moment. But she finds the spectacle of women arguing over their rights and their bodies newly relevant. She and Mr. Pennebaker hosted a screening in Los Angeles after the election this past November “and I was just shocked how much it resonated with people,” she said.
