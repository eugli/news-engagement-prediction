Photograph: Dan Peled/AAP \nBrown, originally from New Zealand, had been hiding from Patea at a safe house and friends’ homes since taking out a domestic violence order against him.\nOn the day of the attack, she had dropped off her three-year-old daughter Aria at day care when Patea chased down her hatchback in a four-wheel drive vehicle.\nWitnesses saw the pair reaching speeds of more than 100km/h and Patea banging on Brown’s driver’s side window with both fists when she had to stop at red lights.\n\nPatea eventually rammed the back of her car, forcing the vehicle down an embankment where it overturned, trapping her inside.\nHe used the metal slab weighing 7.8kg from the side of the road to repeatedly bash her in the head, causing “non-survivable” brain injuries.\nNearby residents who heard the crash originally thought Patea was trying to free Brown and helped him break a window to get to her.\nIt was not until they heard her crying out that they realised what he was doing and tried to stop him, but he fought them off.\nA triple zero call made by Brown earlier captured the sounds of a dozen “thumping” sounds as well as her crying out “Lionel, stop. Please help me.”\nHinton said when she was told her daughter was in hospital, she knew that Patea had found her and hurt her.\n\n“I was oblivious to the extent of his sickening actions,” she said. “My whole world caved in around me as this misogynistic narcissist murdered my baby girl.”\nPatea was likely to be sentenced on Monday.\nCrime - Australia Gold Coast Queensland news   Share   Reuse this content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:11:57.766+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
