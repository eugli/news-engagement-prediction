The information will be broadcast on local media and Department of Transportation message boards as well as on monitors at Education Lottery locations. \nIn order to issue a Blue Alert, there must be information to identify the suspect and law enforcement must also determine a suspect is a threat to the public. \n\"We hope we never have to issue a Blue Alert,\" said Col. Glenn McNeill, commander of the state Highway Patrol. \"However, if we do, North Carolina has this new quick response system that, with tips from the public, will hopefully result in the assailant's capture.\" \nThe Blue Alert started nationwide in 2015 after two New York City police detectives were gunned own while they were sitting in their patrol car.
