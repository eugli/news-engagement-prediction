Image copyright J P Humbert Image caption The gold sovereigns depict Queen Elizabeth II one one side and St George slaying a dragon on the reverse \nAll the Elizabeth II sovereigns, dating from 1958 to 1967, depict St George slaying a dragon on the reverse side. \nEach 0.3oz (8g) coin was valued at more than £200. Image copyright J P Humbert Image caption The solid silver bars were recovered in a suitcase along with more than a hundred gold sovereigns \nThe 16 solid silver bars, weighing 2.2lb (1kg) each, are engraved by the Swiss bullion makers Metalor. \nMr Humbert said the house owner, who wants to remain anonymous, had made a casual reference to a suitcase behind the sofa containing gold. \nHe said: \"I went to pick it up and I almost pulled my shoulder out of its socket, it was so heavy - so I had to drag it out unceremoniously. \n\"It was incredible. My eyes lit up - it was quite a find.\" \nHe said it was unusual for one person to have that many gold sovereigns in one place. \nThis year is the 200th anniversary of the \"modern gold sovereign\" which saw the traditional heraldic Tudor rose emblem on the reverse replaced with St George and the dragon for the first time.
