Proceed at your own risk! \nYou didn’t think the Bachelor 2017 producers were going to leave the Taylor Nolan and Corinne Olympios feud behind in Episode 5, did you? \nThey know the people want drama, and they’re ready to deliver once again in February 6’s Episode 6. \nIn the preview for next week’s outing, we pick back up where we left off — with Taylor interrupting 2-on-1 victor Corinne’s dinner date with Nick Viall . The Bachelor (@BachelorABC) January 31, 2017 \nWe see the recently-eliminated mental health counselor telling the Bachelor, “I felt like I could not leave today without speaking my truth to you.” Eek! \nCue shot of her worried-looking competitor alone at the dinner table. Credit: ABC video still \n“I don’t think anyone was really expecting to see two people go home on a 2-on-1,” an unidentified contestant says ominously in a voiceover, as Nick puts someone in the car. \nWait, do they both go home?! \nThat’s definitely what the show wants you to think, with shots of the crew rolling suitcases out of the house, the other women looking shocked, and uttering the words, “oh my god.” \nHowever, Reality Steve is here to clear things up. \nAs we suspected, the spoiler king confirms the rejected bachelorette’s return is much ado about nothing. The Bachelor (@BachelorABC) January 31, 2017 \nSure, it’ll be interesting to see her put the 36-year-old in his place for keeping a 24-year-old with a nanny instead of her, but it doesn’t change anything. \nThe brunette beauty is still sent home without love, and actually, three more gals are eliminated in the ensuing rose ceremony. Credit: ABC/Rick Rowell) \nAs for the rest of that chaos (and tears) teased in the trailer, that actually seems pretty real — aside from Jasmine Goode pretending to choke him, which is exaggerated. \nVanessa Grimaldi is “scared for Nick” that he’ll end up alone, Whitney Fransway is crying over, well, something, and even the Wisconsin native himself is breaking down. Credit: ABC video still \n“I just want to be honest because I just feel like I hit a new low because I think my biggest fear right now is that the same thing is going to happen,” he admits to his remaining contestants. \n“I really want this to work out but I really wanted it to be real and be right, and right now, I just feel terrified that’s not going to happen.” Credit: ABC video still \nWhat the heck is going on, guys?! \nThe Bachelor Season 21 airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of The Bachelor below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:55:33.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
