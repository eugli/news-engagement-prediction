What happens when you’re not in the office?” \nIn some cases, it can almost be strange to think of someone having a whole other life outside of the shoebox of desks you’ve known them in. \nA Scottish man gave his colleagues some pretty deep insight into his life after he accidentally left his phone at work. \nWhile he had a passcode on it, incoming messages could still be read in full on the lock screen. \nAnd, uh... now he’s a viral sensation. Wait... what? Source: Supplied \nThis raises so many questions. \nWhy did he take a fourth sausage off Gary’s plate? Why is Mum so angry about that? Why did she call him a minute before sending that text — surely they were all seated around the dinner table, especially as it was 7:54pm? If he was close enough to take a sausage from Gary’s plate, why did “Gaz” then proceed to text him about it, rather than just speak? Why has this idiot still not replaced his cracked phone screen? \nThe image was shared by Twitter user @katobell , and has drummed up more than 25,000 retweets and 65,000 likes. \nPeople were quite sympathetic with the recipient. — Chris Donnelly (@ChrisDonners) January 29, 2017 @katobell that is so poetic.
