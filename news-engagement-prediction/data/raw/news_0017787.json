Gjergjani, who has two sons, 1 and 3, with her husband Jeremy, was nervous to learn the gender of her third child. \nWith friends and family watching, Gjergjani’s husband handed her a slice of cake with pink frosting inside — indicating that her baby is a girl. \nHer emotional reaction has been viewed over 760,000 times. \n“And I’ll end up as a meme somewhere,” she joked in the video’s caption. A video posted by Egreis Gjergjani (@thestilettomeup) on Feb 5, 2017 at 9:37am PST \nShe told The Huffington Post she and her husband weren’t planning on having more children after their “two amazing sons,” so her third pregnancy was a surprise. \n“Since I’ve had two boys so far, I genuinely did not think I would have a girl,” Gjergjani said, adding that she designs dresses for little girls in order to experience “what having a little girl would be like.” \nShe said she’s excited to have a “mini-me” to dress in her designs. \n“To be able to carry a child is a blessing,” she said, adding, “That initial discovery of your child’s gender is an amazing feeling. It doesn’t matter if it is boy or girl, just that initial moment of knowing what you’re going to have makes it all so real.” \nGjergjani, who is originally from Albania, said she’s been touched by the online reaction to the video. \n“So many of them have shared tears of joy with me,” she said. “That’s the beauty of humanity. To be able to relate to another human being, without ever knowing them, simply because you can feel the happiness through a video.” \nShe added that she enjoyed seeing her son George’s reaction in the video. \n“He knows mommy is having a baby but had no idea really what was going on,” Gjergjani said. “He just thought we were celebrating something with cake. … I laugh when I see George’s face the entire time. He’s just so confused, wondering, ‘What is wrong with the cake?’” \nGjergjani is due in June.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:15:16.350+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
