But while being named Best Supporting Actor was an honour, it was was of his pregnant fiance Laura Prepon that Ben seemed most proud. Before heading on stage to accept the award for Best Supporting Male for his role in Hell or High Water, the 36-year-old held Laura by the face with both hands for a lingering kiss. Scroll down for video The right priorities: Ben Foster took home the first honors given out at the Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica on Saturday Kiss kiss: Before heading on stage to accept the award for Best Supporting Male for his role in Hell or High Water, the 36-year-old planted a long smooch on pregnant Laura Prepon's lips 'To my beautiful love of my life, Laura, thank you for reminding of the things that are truly important,' the actor said, once he took the stage to accept the win. Foster portrayed ex-convict Tanner Howard in the action crime drama for which he was honored. The character is one half of a brotherly due who craft and execute a wild scheme to save their family ranch from foreclosure in Texas. The Alpha Dog star beat out four incredibly talented actors to take home the prize. His leading lady: Foster puts his arm around pregnant fiancee Laura Prepon in the audience at the 2017 Independent Spirit Awards in Santa Monica Winning performance: Foster portrayed ex-convict Tanner Howard in the action crime drama for which he was honored The other nominated in his category were Ralph Fiennes for A Bigger Splash, Lucas Hedges for Manchester by the Sea, Craig Robinson for Morris from America and Shia LaBeouf American Honey. Perhaps getting the memo early that he hadn't won, LaBeouf was noticeably absent from the ceremony when hosts Nick Kroll and John Mulaney called him out for being arrested at his own art installation. The installation includes the words 'He will not divide us' along with a live stream outside of the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City which will run continuously for the next four years in protest of President Donald Trump. Long time coming: Foster and Prepon, also 36, who have known each other for nearly 20 years, became engaged in October 2016 Being the pros that they are, the hilarious Kroll and Mulaney went ahead with the joke anyway, just like they did with the joke they'd prepared for Sameul L. Jackson, who was also absent.
