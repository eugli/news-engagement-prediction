Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs followed that at the Oscar nominee luncheon by urging those in attendance to \"stand up to those who try to limit our freedom of expression.\" \nAhead of Sunday's Academy Awards (ABC, 7 p.m. ET/4 PT), USA TODAY talked with Boone Isaacs about the past year and the work ahead. \nQ: How big was the relief to see such a diverse slate on Oscar nominations morning? \nA: There were certainly big smiles on all our faces here. This last year has energized many people in the industry to sort of stand up. People were so engaged to see movies, and the conversation of inclusion had already been circulating everywhere. ... Then you put into that mix an incredible array of films this year. Academy president urges Oscar nominees to 'stand up' politically \nQ: How much have your initiatives, such as expanding the Academy with diverse members, helped? \nA: The business is cyclical. So much depends on movie distribution patterns, which we have no control over. It just so happened that there were films this year with diverse talent in front of and behind the camera. There was much more inclusion. But the important issue still remains the same, the issue of inclusion in Hollywood with regard to employment. \nCheryl Boone Isaacs, left, and best supporting actress nominee Viola Davis ('Fences') attend the Oscar nominees' luncheon. (Photo: Kevin Winter, Getty Images) \nQ: When you look at the nominations this year, what areas of work do you see ahead? \nA: Certainly the lack of female directors. For the life of me, I cannot figure that out. We’ve seen an increase in women producers, especially this year. However, there are so many career possibilities in the motion picture business. It's important for us to include all aspects of fresh talent: female, people of color, international people. That’s how you keep the talent pool healthy and growing. We have to nurture that on every level. \nQ: Your message at the Oscar luncheon was to \"speak out\" on issues such as President Trump's immigration ban. Is this call more urgent this year? \nA: At that moment, there was such a heightened — correctly — concern about the political environment. But that’s one topic of conversation in the political arena. I’m hoping Oscar winners will speak about creativity and their aspirations and if they have been realized. \nAcademy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs on stage at the 88th Academy Awards in 2016. (Photo: Aaron Poole, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) \nQ: Was that a call to activism for Academy members? \nA: There is a surge of activism in many different areas, I feel that. ... I have a sense right now that people are going to be more active. I was addressing the folks in our audience. But it’s part of a bigger issue. \nQ: Will the Oscar telecast be political this year? \nA: What I expect is terrific entertainment. Part of the excitement of the show is, of course, who receives Oscars and their expression of happiness, or whatever they wish to speak about. That's what touches people, whether in the theater or watching around the world. 4 CONNECT 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lnTxiC NEVER MISS OUT Life Be a pop culture maven.
