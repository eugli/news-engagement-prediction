GETTY BRIT Awards: The Little Mix girls showcased a variety of quirky designs at the ceremony \nHer fluffy frock featured a PVC bustier-style top, which ensured her ample cleavage was on full display. \nShe added height to her look with a pair of black sandals, while she styled her blonde locks in a quirky braided ‘do. \nLeigh-Anne Pinnock found herself on the worst-dressed list after she chose a distressed denim gown. Her strapless number featured a ripped hem and plaited detailing down the side. \nAnd, completing the group, was Jesy Nelson who sported a floor-length leather gown which had a racy split up the front of her skirt. \nShe put on a very busty display in the low-cut number, while her brunette locks were left in cascading curls. GETTY BRIT Awards: Ellie Goulding flaunted major sideboob as she joined the girls on the red carpet \nThey were joined on the red carpet by Ellie Goulding who flaunted major sideboob as she went braless in a racy black dress. \nHer generous décolletage took centre-stage as the Burn hitmaker risked a nip slip due to the precarious chain straps holding her frock in place. \nThe 30-year-old is nominated for the British Female Solo Artist BRIT award and will face competition from Anohni, Emeli Sande, Lianne La Havas and Nao. \nThe BRIT Awards air on ITV tonight at 7.30pm.
