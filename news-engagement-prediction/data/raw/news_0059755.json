At some points, EastEnders is criticised when it doesnâ€™t mention topical issues or events but when they do, they are condemned equally for preaching. But the writer of last nightâ€™s episode, which briefly highlighted the prevalent racism in the UK, has passionately defended the scenes and hit backs at claims of a BBC â€˜Brexit biasâ€™. \nThe moment in question saw Mick and Johnny Carter attempting to remove racist graffiti from the Queen Vic doors which said â€˜Poles Go Homeâ€™. It had been scrawled there as the Vic was holding a Polish themed night and as the community looked on in despair, they commented to each other on the state of racism in the UK. (Picture: BBC) \nWhile many viewers praised EastEnders for highlighting racism, a handful tweeted that they felt BBC was deliberately trying to undermine Brexit and claimed that the xenophobia shown was a deliberate and â€˜snideyâ€™ attack on the vote. \nOf course, racism and xenophobia has been horrifyingly prevalent in the UK for a long time, with and without Brexit, and Leo Richardson, who penned the scene, expertly responded to the criticism. @bbceastenders \"It's the Britain we live in now\" is not acceptable in a supposedly apolitical soap, please sack tonight's script-writer \nâ€” Gabi Jones (@Gabrielka_J) February 21, 2017 \nAddressing ridiculous claims that he should be sacked for highlighting racism, he said: â€˜So are you saying that racism doesnâ€™t exist? And that this isnâ€™t a very real problem in Britain today? What you saw on screen was a fictional character expressing his own belief. The side of a under represented group of people, I might add.â€™ So are you saying that racism doesn't exist?

It previously mentioned the Brexit vote just after the result came in but the characters avoided giving a view either way other than to say things were uncertain.
