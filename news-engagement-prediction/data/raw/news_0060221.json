Both my brother and I were raised in Franklinton. My great aunt lived here,” Harris said. “We’d crawl all over that scuppernong grape vine, eating grapes. It was some kind of good.” \nThe house Harris’ great-great grandfather built before he took up arms with the Confederate Army is making its last stand as rumors circulate that the old house will soon be history. \n“Well, I’ve heard that the insulation is bad, it needs to be re-piped and new electricity wires put in,” Harris said. \nGlenn Boyd said he bought the property with the intention to restore it, but the home has so much non-original construction that its historic integrity has been compromised. He said the house is in such bad shape that it would not be financially feasible to renovate, so he plans to demolish it. \nHarris said the home has sentimental value for him, with family reunions and wedding portraits happening on the property over the years. He said he would like to see the home remain. \n“I feel bad about it because I think it’s a structure that needs to be preserved, even though it might cost some money to bring it up to code or bring it up to standards. It’s a beautiful house,” he said. “This is history, this is the heritage of this area. I’m here today because of the people who used to live there in that house.” \nBoyd would not disclose what he plans to build on the property once the old house is demolished, but many believe he plans to build a bigger house.
