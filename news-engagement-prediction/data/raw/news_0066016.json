Easy process: Mustafar (in uniform) checking out the immigration process at KLIA as MAHB managing director Datuk Badlisham Ghazali ﻿looks on. \nMustafar said officers from the agencies that issue travel bans – PTPTN, the Inland Revenue Board and the Employees Provident Fund – would also be stationed at the airports. \n“With these kiosks, those blacklisted can settle their outstanding issues, such as making their PTPTN loan payment, and have the ban lifted on the spot,” Mustafar said. \nHe added that this was only one of a few measures taken to manage airport queues. \nThe Immigration Department is having meetings with relevant agencies such as Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd and the Airlines Operating Committee to discuss better ways to enhance its services, including increasing the number of immigration officers, opening all counters and installing more automated gates. \nThe department is also talking to passport chip makers to improve the efficiency of the automated gates, Mustafar added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:43:56.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
