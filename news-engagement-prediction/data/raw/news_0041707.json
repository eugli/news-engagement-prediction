But we all learn by experience, whether politicians or judges. It's easy to be critical after the event.\n“They were faced with an unexpected situation from which, like all sensible people, they learned.”\nLord Neuberger said undermining the judiciary also undermined the rule of law as judges were “the ultimate guardians” of it.\nSupreme Court Brexit Challenge 13 show all Supreme Court Brexit Challenge 1/13 People wait to enter the public gallery outside the Supreme Court ahead of the challenge against a court ruling that Theresa May's government requires parliamentary approval to start the process of leaving the European Union, in Parliament Square, central London\nReuters\n2/13 Gina Miller, co-founder of investment fund SCM Private arrives at the Supreme court in London on the first day of a four-day hearing\nGetty\n3/13 A man waves the EU flag in front of the Supreme Court\nGetty\n4/13 Satirical artist Kaya Mar poses with two of his paintings in front of the Supreme Court\nGetty\n5/13 Pro-Europe protestors dressed as Supreme Court Justices stand outside the Supreme Court ahead of the first day of a hearing into whether Parliament's consent is required before the Brexit process can begin.\r The eleven Supreme Court Justices will hear the government's appeal, following the High Court's recent decision that only Parliament can trigger Article 50\nGetty\n6/13 The eleven Supreme Court Justices will hear the government's appeal, following the High Court's recent decision that only Parliament can trigger Article 50\nGetty\n7/13 Businesswoman Gina Miller arrives at the Supreme Court ahead of the first day of a hearing into whether Parliament's consent is required before the Brexit process can begin\nGetty\n8/13 Attorney General Jeremy Wright arrives at the Supreme Court in London\nEPA\n9/13 Protesters outside the Supreme Court in London, where the Government is appealing against a ruling that the Prime Minister must seek MPs' approval to trigger the process of taking Britain out of the European Union\nPA wire\n10/13 A protesters wearing a judge's wigs and robes stands outside the Supreme Court ahead of the challenge against a court ruling that Theresa May's government requires parliamentary approval to start the process of leaving the European Union, in Parliament Square, central London\nReuters\n11/13 A protester holds up a placard outside the Supreme Court ahead of the challenge against a court ruling that Theresa May's government requires parliamentary approval to start the process of leaving the European Union, in Parliament Square, central London\nReuters\n12/13 Pro-Europe protestors dressed as Supreme Court Justices stand outside the Supreme Court\nGetty\n13/13 A man waiting to enter the public gallery waves a European Union flag outside the Supreme Court ahead of the challenge against a court ruling that Theresa May's government requires parliamentary approval to start the process of leaving the European Union, in Parliament Square, central London\nReuters\n“The rule of law together with democracy is one of the two pillars on which our society is based,” he said.\n“And therefore if, without good reason, the media or anyone else undermines the judiciary, that risks undermining our society.\n“The press and the media generally have a positive duty to keep an eye on things.
