Simon auditioned as Steven Goldblatt (Photo: Channel 4) The rapper proved a hit with the judges (Photo: Channel 4) \nIn his eight hours backstage, Brodkin told how producers coach and persuade contestants to say the right things to judges, manipulate what the acts do on stage and also film fake scenes of celebration and despair BEFORE people have even auditioned.

In my opinion I don’t think it is that. It is contrived, manipulative and you don’t need to have talent. \n“Shortly before I went in front of the judges I was advised what to say and how to present my act.

I was given direction as to how to act and they reshot each stage several times. Once backstage they asked me to look nervous, happy, frustrated, excited etc, filming as many emotions as possible so they have the building blocks to build their own narrative.” Simon was contacted by producers with a questionnaire (Photo: Channel 4) He was invited to audition in front of the judges - and filmed it all (Photo: Channel 4) \nBut a spokesman for the show hit back calling him a fame-hungry fraud and denied manipulation of acts.” \nIn the documentary, Steven travels to Manchester for an initial audition with producers, without the judges present. \nHe hides a camera in his beatbox stereo so he can film it. \nBrodkin said: “No suggestions were made on the day but four days ­afterwards I received a call from an ­associate producer who told me they liked my act but the rap I auditioned with was not right for the show.

The judges were impressed (Photo: Channel 4) He had to stay in character (Photo: Channel 4) \nThe documentary then shows Brodkin having intensive ­make- up and prosthetics to pose as Steven before a London auditions for the BGT judges. \nBackstage footage shows him being repeatedly asked the same question to give the answer producers want. He is also seen posing with a flag, looking as if he is celebrating getting through. This footage is all filmed before he goes on stage.

He then raps about Britain, and why it is great, in the song Red, White and Blue. The judges are easily fooled and put him through to the next round with four yes votes. \nCowell said after the audition: “That was great Steven, it makes you feel proud to be British, it could be like the new National Anthem. I wouldn’t have imagined, Steven, that coming from you. He claimed he was given directions (Photo: Channel 4) A BGT spokesman has denied manipulating contestants (Photo: Channel 4) \n“You are a quiet little thing. But then when the song started, you turned into like 50 Cent.” \nAn executive producer then spotted he was Brodkin and he was stopped from going to the live shows and asked to leave. \nA BGT spokesman has said: “It is not unusual for Britain’s Got Talent to work with acts to ensure their performances are suitable for family viewing. \n“On this occasion Simon Brodkin ­auditioned with a rap containing material we were concerned may cause offence. Simon Brodkin has become infamous for his stunts (Photo: Evening Gazette) \n\"We subsequently found out that Simon Brodkin is a ‘comedian’ and hoaxer who promotes his act by deceiving people. It is untrue to suggest that Britain’s Got Talent manipulated Simon’s act.\" \nA source added: “It’s ironic he thought it was funny to manipulate a full live theatre audience by making false claims about who he was and yet is trying to accuse Britain’s Got Talent of being manipulative. \n“This guy is just desperate for fame – and is hoping to get it by being a professional fraud and con artist.” \n* Britain’s Greatest Hoaxer, Channel 4 tonight at 10pm Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:38:04.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
