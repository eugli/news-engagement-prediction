Parramatta Eels NRL player Kenny Edwards in court last year over the charges. Source: News Corp Australia \nMagistrate Theo Tsavdaridis dismissed the domestic violence charge on condition that the Eels star enter into a six-month good behaviour bond saying the 27-year-old needed, “management and oversight rather than a conviction and punishment.” \nThe court heard that following a fight on the morning of December 11 last year, Edwards sprayed water in the face of his then partner Madison Campbell, 26, before pouring the contents of a beverage on her while she was in bed. \nMr Tsavdaridis said although the assault did not involve physical violence it was “demeaning” and domestic violence matters should never be trivialised. \n“Domestic violence is a problem of considerable proportions in the community,” he said. \nThe court heard New Zealand-born Edwards had been the victim of domestic violence himself at the hands of his father while growing up. \n“He himself saw his mother commit suicide following a lengthy period of dysfunctional familial upbringing,” Mr Tsavdaridis said. thKenny Edwards pleaded guilty to common assault having poured a drink over his partner.
