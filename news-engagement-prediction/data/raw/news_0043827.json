Theo Walcott left red-faced as Arsenal fans slam club for 'disrespectful' gesture \nIt’s a huge week for the Red Devils, with Europa League progress on the line on Wednesday and then an opportunity to win silverware when they take on Southampton at Wembley on Sunday. With such a huge game at the weekend Mourinho may be tempted to keep some of his stars out of harm’s way for the trip to France, particularly considering his side hold a 3-0 advantage over St Etienne from the first leg. \nProviding an injury update after the 2-1 win over Blackburn, Mourinho said: ‘De Gea was rested. Rooney is injured. Jones is injured. I don’t think they will recover [to face Saint-Etienne on Wednesday]. Valencia was rested but Rooney and Jones haven’t trained with the team yet so I don’t think they will be there for Wednesday.’ Manchester United fixtures \nSt-Etienne – Europa (A) – Wed 22 Feb Southampton – EFL (N) – Sun 26 Feb Bournemouth (H) – Sat 4 Mar Southampton (A) – Sun 12 Mar Middlesbrough (A) – Sun 19 Mar West Brom (H) – Sat 1 Apr ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:37:58.645+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
