If conflicts occur, where they will their loyalties lie? \n“When someone has been appointed a Member of Parliament and even the Prime Minister of Somalia, we have to assume that they are Somali nationals,” he said. \n“The fact that he has now become Prime Minister clearly shows that his need for protection should be seen as temporary and not permanent in nature.” Follow Telegraph News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T09:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:17:24.189+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
