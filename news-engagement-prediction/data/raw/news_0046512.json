The young, relatively inexperienced senator from Illinois who first ran for president in 2008 with promises of hope and change delivered at least one of those things to many Americans. On the first Presidents Day since his tenure officially ended, \"Obamas Day\" tweets show that President Obama's legacy is fully intact. \nOn Monday morning, #ObamaDay took over Twitter as users celebrated the most recently retired commander in chief. The overwhelming sentiment was simple: We miss Obama. Even the more generic #PresidentsDay tweets were flooded with photos of 44th president. Clearly, a large subset of the American people were focused on one former president in particular on the holiday. \nThese messages of support for Obama bring his entire presidential career full circle. When he took the political world by storm in 2008, he inspired and energized his supporters like no candidate before him had done. Although his presidency was challenged by tough economic times, violent episodes in the U.S., and terrorism and conflict around the world, Obama somehow found a way to inspire and energize those supporters even into his retirement, which has also featured some uneasy times across the country. He's not the president anymore, but many Americans will still look to him as a sign of hope.
