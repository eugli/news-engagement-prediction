They need to learn their place in the United States, which is to govern football, not politics.”\nThe comments marked Abbott’s second response in three days to McCarthy’s statement following a tweet on Saturday that invoked the NFL’s handling of the Deflategate scandal to cast the league in a negative light.\nGreg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) NFL decision makers also benched Tom Brady last season. It ended with NFL handing the Super Bowl trophy to Brady. https://t.co/Qg06jT9RDp \nFebruary 11, 2017 Although the NFL released a statement about inclusiveness earlier this month prior to the Super Bowl in Houston, it didn’t address whether the bill could put future such events at risk for the state.\nThe NFL has selected future Super Bowl sites through 2021, none of which are in Texas. Dallas hosted the game in 2011 and three Super Bowls have been played in Texas since 2004, which is second only to Florida.\nUnder the Texas bill, people would be required to use bathrooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate. It’s similar to a North Carolina law that prompted the NCAA to pull seven championship events from that state last year and is backed by Republican lieutenant governor Dan Patrick, a powerful figure in the state who had cited the Houston Super Bowl as proof that big events will stick around.\nAbbott had previously been quieter on the proposal and, noticeably, never mentioned bathrooms while laying out his legislative agenda last month.\nNorth Carolina faces six-year NCAA event drought over 'bathroom bill' Read more \nFollowing the NFL statement, Patrick’s office signaled it was remaining firm and was committed to “making sure that every Texan is welcomed” at sporting events.\n“Despite persistent misinformation in the media, under Senate Bill 6, all Texas teams will be able to set their own policies at the stadiums and arenas where they play and hold their events. There is no conflict with the NFL’s statement today and Senate Bill 6,” Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia said.\nSpokespeople for the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans did not immediately return emails seeking comment.\nThe NCAA has declined comment so far since the Texas bill was filed last month. Since 2004, Texas has hosted more combined Super Bowls, NBA All-Star Games (three) and NCAA men’s Final Fours (five) than any other state. San Antonio is scheduled to host another Final Four in 2018, and Dallas is hosting the women’s NCAA Final Four in April.\nUnlike the North Carolina law, the Texas proposal stops short of some provisions the NCAA singled out when defending its decision to relocate events last fall. That includes language that invalidatses local equal-rights ordinances, although there is separate legislation in Texas that could have similar effects.\nThe NFL has issued similar warnings before about state legislation that critics say invites discrimination. In 2015, Georgia Republican governor Nathan Deal vetoed a ‘religious liberty’ bill that the NFL suggested could result in Atlanta being passed over for Super Bowls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T09:17:03.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
