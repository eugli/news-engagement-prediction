The accident happened in good weather on a well maintained road but on a dangerous curve. \n\"I was sleeping when the bus began to flip over,\" the unidentified teenaged passenger told Argentina's Channel 13. \"[When] I woke up and I was falling. \n\"[The bus] was going at a high speed. It hit the roadside, first it moved a little bit and then continued. It went very fast, very fast.\" \nThe passenger said the bus had continued to travel at speed even though passengers volubly complained.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:54:51.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
