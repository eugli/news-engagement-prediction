Safa meet to discuss Bafana successor for sacked Mashaba \n\"If a reinstatement order is granted‚ we will have two head coaches. Don't allow them [Safa] at the CCMA to say we've already employed someone‚\" argued Bollo. \nHe said Safa has indicated that a head coach will be \"identified\" by the end of February‚ a month before the CCMA matter. \n\"If they should appoint a coach‚ while the CCMA matter is unfolding‚ this will cause Mr Mashaba irreparable harm‚\" Bollo said. \nHe said Mashaba stands a good chance of being reinstated as head coach. \n\"We've made out a case that has not been challenged here. Reinstatement [of Mashaba] is a possibility.\" \n- TMG Digital", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T14:59:06.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
