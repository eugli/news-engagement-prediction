Johan Alexis Ramírez who helped guide rescue teams to the Chapecoense plane crash was also invited to the Bernabeu for the Espanyol game :slight_smile: pic.twitter.com/dZdUdd7GM9 - M•A•J (@U1traSuristic) February 20, 2017 \nIt's fantastic to see Real well and truly spoil the 15-year old and give him an experience he will never forget. After his heroics in helping save six lives in the Chapecoense plane crash, it's incredibly heartwarming to see him up close and personal with the individuals who he looks up to so much. \nSpeaking to the Real Madrid website about the signed shirt he was given by James Rodriguez, he said: \n\"James represents all Colombians. It's very emotional and something very nice for me. This shirt is a very nice gift that I will have for a lifetime, it's a pleasure for me. \nA wonderful story for the young man quite rightly dubbed 'Angel Boy'.
