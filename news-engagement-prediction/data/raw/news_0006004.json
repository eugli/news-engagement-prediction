In the supplementary grants, the government allotted Rs 752 crore more making it a total of Rs 2,465 crore. \n\nA reduction in fuel prices and its own cost cutting measures has helped Air India reduce losses but it still accounts for the biggest chunk in the industry. In FY16, the airline posted a net loss of Rs 3,837 crore as compared to Rs 5,859 crore in the previous year. \n\nThe bigger bother for the carrier however is its Rs 46,000 crore debt.

We have to meet our costs: either by borrowing from banks, or delaying payments. That has been happening for several years,\"he added.
