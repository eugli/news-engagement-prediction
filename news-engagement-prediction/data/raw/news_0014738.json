A dejected Leicester were sucked further into the relegation battle following a 3-0 defeat by Manchester United on Sunday There is more drama at the bottom than the top, Jermain Defoe and Romelu Lukaku join illustrious company, and Arsenal's travel sickness continues. \nBBC Sport takes a look at the quirkiest and more interesting statistics from the weekend. The tightest relegation battle ever? \nIf it wasn't already apparent, Leicester City are now in serious danger of going from champions to Championship. \nTheir 3-0 defeat by Manchester United on Sunday, after Swansea's late heartbreak against Manchester City, coupled with stunning wins for Hull City and Sunderland, mean just two points now separate the bottom six in the Premier League. \nThis is only the second time in Premier League history the relegation battle has been this tight after close of play on 5 February. Newcastle United fans may want to look away now... 'Change the manager it's the only thing to do' - Listen as Leicester fan lets loose on 606 \nTottenham were also caught up in the relegation mire at this stage of the 2008-09 season, with 24 points after as many games, but were clear of the bottom six thanks to their superior goal difference. \nThat season saw Newcastle, Middlesbrough and West Brom relegated, with Blackburn's escape suggesting there is hope for current 18th-place occupants Hull. The least competitive title race? \nYou could be forgiven for thinking that Chelsea already have two hands on the trophy after tightening their grip on the Premier League title, while their rivals have faltered in recent weeks. \nBut the Blues' nine-point lead is not the greatest margin any team has held over the rest at this stage of the season. That honour goes to Manchester United, who held a remarkable 15-point lead over Blackburn on 5 February 2001, going on to win the 2000-01 title by 10 points. \nThe Red Devils hold the second biggest lead on this date too, a 13-point advantage again over Blackburn in the 1993-94 season, in which they also won the title. \nYet the third-highest lead at this stage suggests there is some precedent for Chelsea to be caught. Newcastle fans may want to look away, again... \nKevin Keegan's side were, like Chelsea, nine points clear of Sir Alex Ferguson's team on 5 February 1996, only for a run of five defeats in their subsequent nine games to see Manchester United overhaul them in March and eventually claim the title by four points. \nYet with Chelsea only due to face Manchester City and Manchester United from the current top six during their final 14 games, can anyone hope to stop Antonio Conte's side? Golden oldies \nThe old adage goes that age is just a number, but Jermain Defoe's numbers just seem to get more notable the older he gets. \nThe 34-year-old scored twice in Sunderland's 4-0 thrashing of relegation rivals Crystal Palace on Saturday, taking his total for the season to 14. \nDefoe looks on course not only to beat last season's tally of 15, but also surpass his best-ever top-flight total of 18 for Spurs in 2009-10 as he seeks to fire Sunderland to safety once again. \nIt was a weekend for vintage strikers as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, at 35 years and 125 days old, became the oldest Premier League player to score 15 goals in a season, but Defoe actually lags behind plenty of prolific veterans in the list of top Premier League scorers after passing their 30th birthday. Click to see content: top_over30_PLscorers2 \nArsenal legend Ian Wright turned 30 in the 1993-94 season and went on to score an impressive 93 goals in 169 appearances, including 10 as the Gunners won the 1997-98 title, while he also had a brief spell at West Ham. \nHe also has the best goals per game rate of every player to score more than 40 goals aged 30 or over. Indeed, he is the only player to score at better than a goal every other game, with 0.55 goals per game. \nIn comparison, Defoe has now scored 41 goals in 116 Premier League appearances at a rate of 0.35 goals per game since his 30th birthday on 7 October 2012, putting him 16th on the list. \nOf course, no list of golden oldies would be complete without Teddy Sheringham, who struck 77 times in 284 appearances past the 30-year mark and remains the oldest Premier League goalscorer at 40 years and 268 days when he scored for West Ham against Portsmouth in December 2006. The 300 club \nIn scoring the third of his four goals against Bournemouth on Saturday, Everton striker Romelu Lukaku claimed the 300th hat-trick in Premier League history. \nThe inductees into this club range from the illustrious, such as Eric Cantona, who scored the first ever Premier League hat-trick for Leeds United in August 1992, to the more obscure. Think Fredi Bobic for Bolton in April 2002 and Somen Tchoyi for West Brom in May 2011. \nLukaku himself now has three hat-tricks and becomes the 24th player to score four or more goals in a Premier League match. \nBut the 23-year-old Belgian has some way to go before he catches up with the most prolific hat-trick hitters... Click to see content: most_PL_hattricks \nPerhaps unsurprisingly, all-time record Premier League goalscorer Alan Shearer is top with 11, two ahead of Robbie Fowler, with Thierry Henry and Michael Owen tied for third on eight. \nShearer scored two of those hat-tricks for Newcastle United and a remarkable nine at Blackburn Rovers, helping them to sixth in the list of most hat-tricks by club in Premier League history, with 17 in total. \nThe top five hat-trick scoring clubs are the usual suspects - Arsenal topping the pile on 38, thanks mainly to Henry (8) and Ian Wright (5), while Robin van Persie, Emmanuel Adebayor and Theo Walcott have all scored three trebles for the Gunners. Arsenal's away woes \nTS Eliot wrote April was the cruellest month, but for Arsenal fans it could well be February. \nYet again their season appears to have unravelled at this crucial time of year and it was a case of history repeating itself as they once more failed to beat one of their supposed title rivals away from home in a 3-1 defeat by Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. \nSince a newly-wealthy Manchester City joined the so-called \"big six\" in the 2009-10 season, the Gunners have failed to win more than two games in any one campaign on the road against their five main rivals, also consisting of Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.
