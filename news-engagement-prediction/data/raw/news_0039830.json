But while CEO Evan Spiegel and company are generating the expected level of buzz for their efforts, their move to the public market is an outlier among startups. \nAt least, that’s according to a recent survey of 941 startups — 69% of which were from tech — by Silicon Valley Bank.

That shouldn't be a huge shock: While getting bought out isn’t the most idealistic route for tech entrepreneurs, it’s usually the most straightforward, especially for companies which just don’t have Snap’s potential for growth. \nStatista", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:09:04.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
