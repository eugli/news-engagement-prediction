The problem is, no one really seems to know what Trump is talking about. \nDuring a rally today in Florida, Trump talked about ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs happening last night in Sweden‚Äù as he defended his blocked executive orders to limit immigration from several Muslim nations. Sweden did not experience any kind of specific major terror attack in the past 24 hours, and it would appear that Trump was referencing a Friday night Fox segment where Tucker Carlson discussed Sweden‚Äôs immigration policy . \nThis seems to be the latest instance where Trump lifted talking points from television he was watching. \nAs things stand, Trump is getting mocked by those who are saying that by hyping up a false terror attack, he‚Äôs doing exactly what Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer have done: Trump on terrorism: And what happened last night in Sweden was terrible‚Ä¶ \nDonald, there was NO incident last night in Sweden. #FakeNews \n‚Äî Michael Skolnik (@MichaelSkolnik) February 19, 2017 Maybe the victims of The Bowling Green Massacre will have a fundraiser for the victims of last nights incident in Sweden. üôÑ #TrumpRally \n‚Äî Jennifer Hubbartt (@JenHub17) February 19, 2017 Conway makes up Bowling Green Massacre. Spicer makes up attack in Atlanta. Trump makes up attack in Sweden. All fake; all blamed on Muslims. \n‚Äî Melissa McEwan (@Shakestweetz) February 19, 2017 Everyone mad at Trump for not denouncing the mosque shooting, but no one‚Äôs giving him credit for talking a/b the Sweden attack he made up.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T06:12:18.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
