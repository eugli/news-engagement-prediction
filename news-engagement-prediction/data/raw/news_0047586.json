Mercury Press Bouncy castle boss David Cooke was left embarrassed after sending this topless selfie to a female customer Mercury Press Since sharing the tongue-in-cheek picture online the business owner of 19 years has reportedly built up a considerable female fan-base Mercury Press Mr Cooke said that he had lost two stone after taking a gruelling eight-week training course in Thailand \nThe mortified owner quickly apologised, texting “sorry sent wrong photo, how embarrassing”. \nBut surprisingly the mum ignored the apology and booked the £50 jungle-themed toy for her tot’s christening. \n“It was so embarrassing,” said Mr Cooke from Upfield in East Sussex. \n“As soon as it read ‘sent’ I realised what had happened. \n“Bouncy castles are a very seasonal business with peak months being between May and October so last November I went to Thailand to do an eight-week fitness course. \n“While I was there the dietician advised me to take weekly progress pics to track my progress. \n“As I scrolled through the pics on my phone my thumb must have got stuck on that instead of ones of the bouncy castles and I hit send.” RELATED STORIES Woman accidentally posts topless selfie in rave online review of her new washing machine TOPLESS GUN RAF officer tried to send topless selfie to boyfriend but accidentally shared it with THOUSANDS of soldiers AN UNFORTUNATE SLIP-UP Actress left red-faced after accidentally flashing her boobs on Facebook Live YOU MUPPET!

All the mums of the under-15s rugby team I help coach have joked about it. \n“I apologised straightaway but she didn’t really acknowledge it – though she probably had a laugh. \n“I really need to put my pictures of the bouncy castles in a separate folder to my camera roll to make sure it doesn’t happen again. \n“I’ve learned my lesson and now double-check every picture before I hit send.” \nWe pay for your stories!
