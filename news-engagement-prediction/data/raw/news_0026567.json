West Ham 2-2 West Brom What is the background to the incident? \nPulis managed Stoke for a total of 10 years during two spells between 2002-05 and 2006-13, with Shawcross a vital member of the team and captain for several years. \nStoke reached the FA Cup final in 2011 under Pulis and played in the Europa League the following season. \nHowever, relations between Pulis' former side and his current team have been strained following comments before and after their Premier League match earlier this month. \nStriker Berahino joined Stoke on 20 January in a Â£12m deal and it was later revealed he served a suspension before leaving West Brom, for a \"Football Association disciplinary matter\".

I took them to an FA Cup final and to Europe. \n\"Do you think I'm going to criticise that area and those people? It's absolutely disgraceful whoever has put that out.\" What did Mark Hughes say? \nIn a news conference on Friday, Hughes said: \"I was annoyed with their manager (Pulis) ringing up Ryan on the Monday morning after the game and calling him a loser. I wasn't too happy with that.\" \nOn the message left for Shawcross, Hughes added: \"There was a voicemail left, and I haven't heard it. But Ryan wasn't too pleased. He tried to ring back and didn't get any answer.\" How did Tony Pulis respond? \nPulis said he had contacted Shawcross but dismissed claims he had called the player a \"loser\". \n\"Firstly, the phone call I made to Ryan is private,\" added Pulis. \"And then, yes, I did mention losers, but I said about people with innuendos making allegations that weren't true. \n\"I did use the word loser but I meant it in that way and I actually said, 'Ryan, you've never been that'.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Referee got decisions right - Pulis Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:15:47.170+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
