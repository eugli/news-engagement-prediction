The city will host a public meeting to discuss proposed changes Thursday night at the Kate Jackson Community Center on South Rome Avenue from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Bike lane along Bayshore Boulevard in Tampa Google Earth/Maps Proposed changes include reducing the speed limit on Bayshore Boulevard from 40 miles per hour to 35 and reducing travel lanes to 10 feet. The additional room would allow the city to add a two-foot buffer to existing bike lanes. Buffered bike lanes would be added from Rome Avenue to south of Howard Avenue. The city would also add three reflective flashing beacon crosswalks at S. Dakota Avenue, S. Delaware Avenue and between S. Brevard Avenue and W. Swann Avenue. Faded striping between Rome Avenue and Platt Street would be replaced with new striping, made to be more visible to motorists and cyclists. Changes are intended to improve safety and traffic flow in the corridor, the city said. The project, which would ultimately be funded by the Florida Department of Transportation , is currently in its design phase. That process is expected to run through May. Construction on any approved changes hasnâ€™t been scheduled. Janelle Irwin is a reporter for the Tampa Bay Business Journal.
