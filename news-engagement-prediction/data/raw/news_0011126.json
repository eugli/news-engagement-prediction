At first, we didn't recognise Timmy Hung, and realised a big star had arrived only when Sammo Hung sat down,\" said a staff member who did not give his name. \nRestaurant owner Chen Chonglu told Shin Min that he personally waited on Hung's table. \nThe martial artist ordered many dishes for his family, Mr Chen said. This included a $65 claypot turtle soup and black chicken soup that cost $13. \nHung told Mr Chen in Cantonese: \"The soup is very good!\" \nRead also: Chow Yun-fat spotted at Founder Bak Kut Teh again \nThe veteran actor left about an hour later. \nMr Chen said: \"To have a huge star visit us during Chinese New Year and have a satisfying meal, I'm really honoured and proud!\" \nHung is known for his body of work in Hong Kong action cinema, churning out more than 230 movies since his film debut in 1961.
