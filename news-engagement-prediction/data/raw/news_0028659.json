Owner John Pani , who also operates Park & Rec in University Heights, cites its appeal to families as the motivation behind expanding the established 30th Street eatery north to the newly-developed Del Sur Town Center , where it will be one of three full-service restaurants in the complex. Joining a nicely curated selection of independent eateries including next door neighbor Piacere Mio, a South Park transplant, Waypoint Public is currently building out a 3,500-square-foot space, which will include an outdoor patio, seating for 170 guests, and a kids playpen built cleverly into one of the restaurant walls. Executive chef Rich Sweeney will be rolling out a new seasonal menu in North Park and Del Sur, which will keep popular core items, including the grilled cheese, fish and chips and the burger, but add more salads and lighter seafood entrees to the Del Sur location, where his open kitchen will be fronted by a chefs table where the former Top Chef competitor will cook up special VIP and group menus. Due by early April , the new Waypoint Public will also feature a cocktail program on top of its 30 craft beer taps and wine offerings. Pani tells Eater that the original North Park location will also be adding cocktails later this year. He says he’s interested in bringing Waypoint Public to other underserved neighborhoods, and will likely open another in the North County area before expanding elsewhere in San Diego or beyond.
