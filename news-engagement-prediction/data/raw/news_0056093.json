Detainees at Guantanamo bay Credit: AP \n\"What was particularly frustrating was that in some cases our security services had legitimate evidence that these former Guantanamo detainees were wrong 'uns, but could not disclose it because in doing so they would also have had to disclose damaging information about the activities of their American counterparts\", said a lawyer. \nHe added, however, that the law has now been changed, via the 2013 Justice and Security Act, to prevent compensation payments being payable to the likes of al Harith. That legislation makes it possible for highly sensitive and confidential security information to be heard and considered in private by judges. \nThe source said that if the situation arose today, al Harith would not be paid a penny.
