Some of these animals have a mixture of genes in their cells. \n\"It is more common for some males to have some female genitalia and undescended testicles, known as hermaphrodites. But it is also possible to get females with some male organs which would be known as pseudo-hermaphrodites.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:37:34.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
