(PHOTO: Lim Wui-Liang) More The pilot of a river taxi that dramatically caught fire on the Singapore River last July had traces of narcotics in his system, said police investigators at a Coroner’s Inquiry on Thursday (23 February). Investigations also found that the late Ong Hock Long, 33, had debts and that the blaze had been deliberately set. Ong’s vessel, a river taxi deployed by Singapore River Cruise (SRC), caught fire near the Esplanade at around 6.20pm on 12 July, 2016. He went missing after jumping into the water and his body was recovered following a 27-hour search. A toxicology report concluded that Ong had traces of amphetamines and methamphetamines in his blood, said investigating officer Inspector Lam Jia Yen. Lam told the court that Ong’s consumption of the drugs was “approximate to the time of death” and likely “played a role in the death of the deceased”. The report added that the drugs could cause confusion, affect a person’s ability to respond to situations, as well as “hallucinations and bizarre, violent behaviour”. Lam noted that enquiries with the Credit Bureau showed that Ong had unsecured credit card loans with several banks dating back to 2014. Previous media reports said that Ong needed help from his family to pay off debts from a failed duck rice stall venture in 2011, and was also upset over a failed relationship. ‘An incendiary fire deliberately set’ Lieutenant-Colonel Andy Choo of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), a lead fire investigator at the time of the incident, testified that the blaze started when a “significant pile” of life jackets was stacked at the front of the passenger cabin and set alight. Ong’s boat contained more than 50 life jackets, which were stored under the seats. A burn test was also conducted with two life jackets obtained from SRC, which found that they were “easily ignitable” since they are made primarily from hydrocarbon-based materials, added Choo, who has investigated about 300 fatal fires in the last five years. The enclosed passenger compartment, which was where the fire originated from, also helped to fuel the ensuing blaze. Asked by State Counsel Tang Shang Jun if the fire could have been started by chemical or electrical means, or if it might have been accidental, Choo replied, “This rapid development of fire is not consistent with that of an accidental fire.” He added that there was no indication that any of the three fire extinguishers on board had been used. SRC river taxis, which ply a loop service around Marina Bay, are equipped with fire extinguishers and life jackets. Ong, a heavy smoker, was also discovered with a lighter on his body. View photos More Erratic behaviour SRC ticketing officer Dewi Sutra was with Ong on the day of the incident and testified as to his erratic behaviour. At around 5pm, she was with Ong on his boat, which was scheduled to make a stop at Clarke Quay to pick up waiting passengers. CCTV footage screened in court showed that Ong’s vessel approached the embarkation point before suddenly reversing and heading towards Boat Quay, deviating from his normal route. This created much confusion among his colleagues, who placed calls to Sutra in a bid to get Ong to come back. “I think he tried to get away from Clarke Quay because he told me that someone is there,” said Sutra, who had only been working at Singapore River Cruise for five months at that point. She added that she did not know who Ong was referring to. Asked by State Coroner Marvin Bay to clarify his tone of voice, she replied, “Fearful.” Ong then asked Sutra to jump off his vessel RC36 and onto a passing vessel, RC15, when they were near the Fullerton Hotel. Read More “He looked agitated, like he needs to rush off somewhere else. So he asked me to go off the boat and let him be alone,” said Sutra, adding that this was not part of standard operating procedure. Sutra was also shown a video clip in which Ong’s boat is seen banging against the Elgin Bridge shortly after. In response, she said, “I was shocked, because it never happens.” ‘Why didn’t the company send anyone to save my son?’ SRC manager Raymond Tang, 34, also testified that Ong had become “very quiet” and “very negative in his thinking” during the year leading up to the incident. He explained that Ong had become more impatient and less willing to work hard. Asked by the State Counsel if he knew of any problems Ong was facing, Tang said that he had heard from other boatmen about his financial issues. He also loaned Ong about $1,400, which was only partially repaid. Tang and Ong had known each other for about three years, and had even gone overseas together. But they drifted apart after Ong found a girlfriend, said Tang. Ong’s parents were present and followed the proceedings via a Mandarin translator. His mother had told investigators that her son called her at around 5pm that day to ask her to cook his share of dinner, and that it was a “normal conversation”. Given the opportunity to ask questions of the witnesses, Ong’s parents queried the SRC’s handling of the incident. Towards the end of the hearing, when asked if they had any questions for the SCDF’s Lt-Col Choo, Ong’s mother replied, “There is no point in asking, because what happened has happened. We were not there, so we cannot know what exactly happened.” Reblog ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:19:38.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
