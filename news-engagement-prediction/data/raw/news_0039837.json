Jackie referred to an incident between the pair that happened a few years ago, saying: 'I don't like him because of what he did to you, in that respect â€” but it was years ago,' adding that maybe they should move on from the incident. Not holding back: 'I hate the guy's guts,' Kyle said, adding David (pictured L, with Today Extra co-host Sonia Kruger) is a 'big-mouth, a piece of s**t' What happened? Jackie referred to an incident between the pair that happened a few years ago Kyle unleashed, saying father-of-three David was a 'big-mouth, a piece of s**t' and said he would hold a grudge 'to the death.' 'I'll p**s on his grave before I go on that f**king show,' he said. Kyle said he has banned the star, 43, from appearing on his radio show, but would let him on if he could 'smack him in the face with a dead fish.' Not happy: Kyle said he has banned the star from appearing on his radio show, but would let him on if he could 'smack him in the face with a dead fish' During Kyle and Jackie's chat with Sonia, Kyle took another swipe at David. He told Sonia he'd co-host the show with her one day, when her 'a*** puppet' isn't there. Sonia, no doubt feeling a little awkward, said: 'I don't understand it, I don't get it,' about Kyle and David's feud. Kyle explained, saying: 'He was a nice guy and then he jumped on the bandwagon of hate and then I was like, \"well b***h you sit over there on your own then.\" When it stared: Kyle said David 'jumped on the bandwagon of hate' The shock jock added that he saw David out one time, and claimed he 'ran away.' 'I saw him at the movies one day and he ran off in the other direction and he was petrified,' Kyle said, saying he had burly men he dubbed 'gorillas' with him, and that perhaps David thought it was a set up. Sonia laughed it off saying they need to 'smoke the peace pipe' when Kyle sarcastically asked if he smokes 'the pipe.' Sonia then said how healthy her colleague is and how watches what he eats as a vegan, when Kyle went off again. 'He's a seed eater!' Sonia then said how David is healthy and watches what he eats as a vegan, when Kyle again went off 'No wonder I can't stand him, he's a seed eater! He's like, \"I don't want to get too big,\" eating his seeds.' Despite slamming Jimmy Barnes' son David, Kyle said he still watches Today Extra and likes Sonia. Sonia and Jackie meanwhile, said they would be staying out of the feud. Daily Mail Australia has contacted representatives of David and Kyle for comment, in relation to this story. Channel Nine declined to comment.
