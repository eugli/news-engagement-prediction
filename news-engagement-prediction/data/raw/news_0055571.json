Lucasfilm has announced that the standalone Star Wars story will arrive on Digital HD and the Disney Movies Anywhere service on March 24 and then be available on Blu-ray, DVD, and on-demand on April 4. To mark the news, Lucasfilm released a new trailer (watch above) teasing the bonus materials available with the home edition. Depending on which format you choose, you’ll be able to get in-depth info on the idea that launched the first Star Wars Story outside the “Skywalker Saga,” behind-the-scenes breakdowns of all the newly introduced heroes and villains, a look at the digital wizardry involved in recreating Grand Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia, and a featurette on the myriad Easter eggs referencing previous entries in the Star Wars cinematic universe.

As has been widely reported, substantial amounts of Rogue One were tweaked during reshoots , and fans have been clamoring to see some of the excised material (some of which will be revealed in the Marvel comic adaptation also coming in April) and alternate footage. Alas, none will be included here.

Of course, the biggest complaints with the initial home release of The Force Awakens last April was the absence of a J.J. Abrams commentary and only a scant amount of deleted scenes; both were eventually included in the subsequent four-disc collector’s edition that came out in November. So there might still be some hope for Rogue One fans.
