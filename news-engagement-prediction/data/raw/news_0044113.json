And it seems like controlling rapist Pierce is set to get even worse, meaning misery ahead for poor Rhona. \nFans were left horrified when Pierce forced himself on Rhona and his gaslighting behaviour and attempts to isolate Rhona and maintain control over her have left everyone watching desperate for Rhona to escape the destructive relationship. \nAs Pierce continues to chip away at Rhona’s confidence, the storyline is about to take another dark turn. \nIain explained to Metro.co.uk at a recent event: ‘Rhona and Pierce’s story is swinging into top gear and what I’ve loved about it so far is that as soon as people saw Pierce getting together with Rhona so quickly, they started to suspect that there was something not quite right about him. \n‘We’ve taken our time and let that story develop slowly and it reaches a kind of peak in April/May time, I think. It doesn’t come to an end there but there’s a big story explosion. The episodes are heart-stoppingly dramatic – quite a tough watch but an unbelievably big talking point heading into the summer.’ All the press event gossip! \nIn case you missed any, here are links to all of the articles from the Emmerdale press event. \nFirst details of Chas’ exit revealed ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:39:58.781+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
