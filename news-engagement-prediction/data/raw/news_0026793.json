The Fences star is the father of 25-year-old twins, Olivia and Malcolm Washington, and shared with ET's Denny Directo at the 2017 NAACP Image Awards on Saturday the one piece of advice he would give to the Clooneys.

I'm not talking to George, I'm talking to his wife. Sleep now!\" \"He's gonna need support, and not from an actor,\" Washington, 62, added. \"It's going to be a real performance. He'll see, but it's beautiful. We have twins and they're grown now, but it's a miracle.\" EXCLUSIVE: George Clooney Jokes About Second Anniversary to Wife Amal -- 'And They Said It Wouldn't Last' Last week, ET also caught up with George Clooney's pal, Matt Damon , who was thrilled that his friend would soon be a father to twins. \"I've never had twins. He has it coming,\" the father of four joked. \"I had them one at a time and that was plenty.\" \"It's going to be a huge challenge, I mean, one baby cries, wakes the other up. Itâ€™s going to be on in that household,\" Damon, 46, added. \"[But] he doesn't sleep a lot anyway. He'll be alright. I'm serious, he's got a hell of a work ethic.\" RELATED SLIDESHOW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:21:42.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
