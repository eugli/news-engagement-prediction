Tensions escalated when Albania became the first country to recognize Kosovo, outraging Serbia. \nThe text made a point of its anger toward a monument and talked of wanting to destroy the piece. \n“In Pristina, shamely [sp] now located in Kosovo, there is a monument called NewBorn. A fucking monument with a clear meaning: peace and new beginning, let’s forget the past. Jesus, Forgive my anger and what I’ll say, but if I ever end up in that dirty city, I’ll pee on this so called monument and destroy it.” \n– Hackers Kuroi’SH and Prosox \nAs can be seen in the hacked website’s content, Asiana Airlines was not the real target, but Albania and Kosovo. According to an insider in Asiana Airlines, it was the not the actual website that was hacked, but the DNS web-hosting company that had hosted their domain. Asiana Airlines also tweeted updates about the status o their website on their official Twitter account. \n“The website itself was not hacked, but the web-hosting company that manages our domain name system (DNS) was attacked which led to this problem. We have assessed that our clients’ personal information and data has not been leaked. \n– Insider of Asiana Airlines IMPORTANT NOTICE: Our Domain Name System has been compromised where users are redirected to another website when accessing our URL. (1/2) \n— Asiana Airlines (@AsianaAirlines) February 20, 2017 \nBesides those who accessed the site at the time of the hacking, our website is now back to its original state, but in order to fully recover from the hack, more time will be needed. We are planning on reporting the issue to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA).” \n– Insider of Asiana Airlines The matter has been reported immediately and is expected to be fully recovered soon. We apologize for any inconvenience caused. (2/2) \n— Asiana Airlines (@AsianaAirlines) February 20, 2017 \nBelow is a screen recording of the full website at the time of the hacking.
