Of around 300GB only about 4.5GB is left,” the company wrote in a blog. \nWe accidentally deleted production data and might have to restore from backup.

Kudos for transparency!\n— Lacy Paschal (@lacydev) February 1, 2017 While noticing the error quickly, the start-up was unable to fully restore all of the data.\n“Out of five backup/replication techniques deployed, none are working reliably or set up in the first place. We ended up restoring a six hours old backup,” the company wrote.\nThankfully, the database in question only contained comments and bug reports, meaning it wasn’t home to anyone’s code that would have been lost from the missing six-hour window.\nWhat is the worst mistake you have made with deleting something?
