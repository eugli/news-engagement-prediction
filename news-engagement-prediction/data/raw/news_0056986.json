The problems began almost immediately, with cost overruns and construction delays.\nAfter its first year of operation, the facility was failing to meet water quality standards and the town of Dawson City refused to take over operation of the plant, as had been planned.\nThat forced the Yukon government to maintain ownership of the plant, until Dawson was willing and able to take it over. Last year, the territory realized that was never going to happen and assumed permanent ownership of the plant .\nThe government has said the sewage treatment plant is still not meeting the discharge standards of its water license. Operation costs are also as much as seven times higher than what was originally promised by Corix.\nWith files from Vic Istchenko", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:42:12.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
