Per the report, “it is known he is currently in the process of gauging interest for his entry into the 2018 race.”\nAnd a survey of Alabama residents about the worthiness of Tuberville’s candidacy is reportedly going to influence his decision. The coach resigned from his position at Cincinnati in December after a 4-8 season with the Bearcats. His career record at the four schools is 159-99\nTommy Tuberville resigned from Cincinnati in December. (Getty) More Someone with the resume of Tuberville’s is well-versed in the art of politicking. But would Alabama be willing to vote for an Auburn coach who isn’t the most popular? We’re only slightly joking when we say Nick Saban could announce he’s running for governor the day before the election and win in a runaway, but would Tuberville, 62, stand a chance among the legions of Alabama fans in the state?\nThe answer, of course, is largely based on who he runs against. And Alabama residents aren’t too fond of their current governor , Robert Bentley, who allegedly had an affair with an aide.\nTuberville has dipped his toe into the water of political statements before. In 2011 he appeared on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show where the topic of then-President Barack Obama’s birth certificate came up . During the exchange, Tuberville said that “Obviously there’s got to be something on there that he doesn’t want anyone to see.”\nCoincidentally, not long after Tuberville made his remarks on Fox News, Obama released his birth certificate. And anyway, it’s unlikely Tuberville’s stance regarding Obama’s birthplace would have any affect on his appeal given what happened in the Nov. 8 presidential election.\nPer the report, Tuberville is expected to make a decision about his gubernatorial aspirations in the next couple weeks. If he decides to run, we suggest that he make those campaign signs void of both Auburn and Alabama colors. Play it right down the middle.\n– – – – – – –\nNick Bromberg is the assistant editor of Dr. Saturday on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
