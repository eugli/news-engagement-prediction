I mean, I once stayed at a hotel in which I didn’t watch the TV the whole time I was there because I couldn’t find the ‘on’ switch and was too embarrassed to ask reception. I also struggle with everyday things such as downloading movies and knowing how to make my face look weird on Snapchat. \nBut, despite the fact I’m about as tech savvy as a 80-year-old rancher, even those who know me best are flummoxed as to why I haven’t bothered getting any phone data or credit in the nearly six months I’ve been living in Amsterdam. \nWhen I lived in Bangkok, I was one of those people who was glued to their phone. I’d walk along the street with my head down, scrolling through Facebook. I’d WhatsApp my friends while taking a motorbike taxi at high speed through the city. I’d send tweets between workout sets and listen to music while reading the news while I was on the train. I was one of those zombie-looking types you see people post cartoons of on Facebook. \nAnyway, when I arrived in Amsterdam, I didn’t really have as much to talk about. Nobody wants to post the cruddy aspects of their life on Facebook and, for the first couple of months in a new city you’re mainly just looking for a place to live, trying to convince people to be your friend and generally feeling a bit green. Being a newbie isn’t very fun and certainly isn’t something you want to brag about on your social media channels which, if you’re using social media properly, is exactly what you’re meant to do. \nSo, I didn’t bother getting any phone data. I used Wi-Fi at work and home, and barely went anywhere else. I didn’t have anyone to call or message, so I just left it. And left it. Now I’ve been in Amsterdam nearly six months and I still don’t have any phone data and, while other people look at me as if I’ve just told them I don’t believe in dogs or that I live in a cave in Mongolia when I tell them about it, I really enjoy it. \nI am on the internet all day at home (watching Netflix, skyping friends, googling pictures of baby rhinos, etc.) and at work (using the server, researching stories, googling pics of baby hippos, etc.) so, really, it’s quite refreshing to have to do without it, sometimes. \nExcept, you know, when you’re late to meet someone and you can’t phone them to tell them, or you’re lost and you can’t check on Google maps to see where on earth you are. But, yeah, apart from those times, life is better with an enforced break from staring at a screen. It’s also fun for a bit of nostalgia for what it was like to be 15 again — you know, when you had to be on time for things and meet people in specific places. I’ll see you at 3pm at the town hall doors, etc. \nI’m sure, at some point, I’ll rejoin the 21st century, but until then, I’ll be on time for all my appointments and, possibly a little late in replying to your messages.
