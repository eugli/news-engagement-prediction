He was largely a squad player at those clubs – and suffered with achilles tendon problems last year – but has won 68 international caps for Uruguay and was in the starting team that knocked England out of the 2014 World Cup.

However, Stephens has only just broken into the first team and Gardos has just returned after being injured for the past two years. \nCaceres will not come cheap in terms of his wages but, as a free agent, can be signed outside of the transfer window for free on what is likely to be a short-term deal. He also had a trial at Crystal Palace but Sam Allardyce instead opted to take Mamadou Sakho on loan from Liverpool. Southampton did also look at Sakho but were more interested in a permanent deal and were not willing to pay a potential £20 million fee.
