And this year, collectively around the world, consumers will spend about US $500 billion on tech products. \nConsumers making a beeline to buy the latest iPhone \nThat’s a whopping Rs 33.5 lakh crores! The figure’s greater than India’s budget expenditure estimate for 2017-2018 which stands at about 21.5 lakh crores. \nThat’s where all the iPhones, Android phones, laptops, PCs, cameras, and other off-the-shelf consumer tech gadget spending falls under. Never thought the number would be this big, did you? However, this consumer tech spending estimate from IDC dwarfs in comparison to the total global tech spending -- products, services, IT -- everything combined for both consumers and businesses. That number is at the astronomical US $2.4 trillion, as per IDC’s predictions, and this is only for the calendar year 2017. Just over 20 per cent of that total tech spending is related to consumer tech products and gadgets spending, which amounts to about US $500 billion. According to IDC, USA makes up for a giant chunk of all that trillions of dollars of worth of tech spending, amounting to US $960 Billion. Behind America, European comes in second, followed by Asia-minus-Japan in third place -- that’s the hierarchy of global tech spending power, right there.
