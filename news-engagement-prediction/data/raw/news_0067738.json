Credit: BPM. Campaigners from the Birmingham Civic Society, the Birmingham Trees for Life campaign and the 1,500 people who signed a petition to save it had been given reassurance that their plans would be considered, giving them hope of a reprieve.\nAn extra root survey was carried out following the fallout to see if the benches could be worked around the tree - the results of which were being awaited by campaigners.\nDespite the efforts, today work has started to prepare the tree to be chopped down tomorrow morning, a move which has infuriated campaigners who claim council bosses had not informed them of the move.\nThey are now organising a protest in the Square tomorrow. Campaigner Cllr Fiona Williams (Lab, Hodge Hill) said:\n“There is no reason for this tree to go - it could stop a juggernaut and there are ways to work around it. Someone at this council does not want it and is determined to get rid of it. It’s symbolic of the very cavalier attitude some officials have to our trees which, with the pollution in the city centre are needed more than ever.”\n– Campaigner Cllr Fiona Williams Protester Ray Egan, aka John Bull, added: \"Storm Doris couldn't move her, but here comes the council to destroy our lovely tree.\" A joint statement from the city council and Transport for West Midlands said:\n“We have looked long and hard at all the options to retain this particular tree but because the Metro extension and the Centenary Square development, with its in-built anti-terror measures, have been designed as one integrated scheme it has sadly not been possible. While it is unfortunate we will have to lose this London plane tree, we will be planting 59 semi-mature trees as part of the new square design, making the area even greener than before.”\n– Birmingham City Council.
