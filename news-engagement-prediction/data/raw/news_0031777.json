These users see Google’s software — its customization options, hardware affordability, and no-frills design — as the perfect refutation of the sterile, mass-marketed appeal of Apple’s iPhone. Your Tinder date, however, doesn’t care about any of that, according to cold, raw data. In fact, your date is judging you, and so are their friends, family, and likely everyone sitting in and around your table at dinner and then later on at the bar. \niPhone owners are far more likely to hate on Android phones According to a study conducted by Match.com and Research Now , iPhone owners are about 21 times more likely to negatively judge a date who uses an Android phone. On the flip side, Android owners are only 15 times as likely to negatively judge a date for opting for iOS. \nWhat this says about iPhone users isn’t really clear. Perhaps they’re haughty, condescending elitists who see technology as a badge of social status, and an $800 cellphone as a way to lord that over others. Or maybe they just really have no idea why your text messages are green and not blue. This confusing deviation from the norm could really freak them out — or in the case of this writer , get you coyly made fun of until the overwhelming shame forces you to trade in your Nexus. (We’ll leave the Google Pixel, an excellent and pricey Android smartphone , out of this debate.)\nEven worse in this situation is a cracked screen. The same study found that women are 86 percent more likely to negatively judge a date for having a broken smartphone screen. So if you’re an Android-toting, cracked-screen-having dude that just loves living on the edge of gadget acceptability, maybe consider a dumb phone for when you want to go out. Those are hard to break, and they have the added benefit of not having the Twitter app .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:14:02.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
