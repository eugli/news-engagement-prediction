'It will dry out tonight and the only places that will see further bits of rain, sleet and snow tomorrow morning will be parts of eastern Scotland. 'Elsewhere it should a dry start, sunny in Wales and southern England, but with gales around the coasts of England, the north coasts of Cornwall and Devon.' This photo, taken yesterday, shows a vehicle sidelined in a ditch near Hamsterley, in County Durham, as the icy and snowy conditions made roads hazardous Yesterday, sheep gathered in a snow-covered field near Castleside, County Durham, as the country braced itself for freezing weather Mr Powell said the mercury will peak at 11C in the south-west on Monday, but high winds will make it feel colder. 'Around the middle of the week, things are going to turn a bit warmer but the high winds will remain. 'Temperatures will creep up, and we will start to feel it a bit warmer because of a change in wind direction. 'Towards the end of the week we could see high pressure building in again. 'It will be more settled with lighter winds on Thursday and Friday and temperatures will moderate at around 9 or 10C.' 'Willy-willy' hits chilly hilly: Rare 100ft tall SNOWNADO is spotted on Scottish mountain This is the moment a rare 'snownado' touched down on a mountain in the Scottish Highlands, whirling snow and ice in a circle at least 100ft off the ground. Skiers and walkers were dwarfed on Cairngorm Mountain near Aviemore by the stunning spiralling pillar of snow – also known as a 'willy willy' - which disappeared as quickly as it appeared. The phenomenon – spotted by Lynn Godfrey on Monday of last week - typically forms when a cold air mass passes over a warmer surface, heated by sunlight. Wind shear then causes the rising air to spin. Ms Godfrey, 49, of Newmains, North Lanarkshire, said: 'We were in Aviemore on holiday. We came for the dog sled rally and stayed an extra week for the walking. 'We have two malamutes, a malamute/German shepherd and a labrador with us, so we walk constantly. It was so windy, our van was almost blown over. I've never seen anything so beautiful but so scary before.' Met Office meteorologist Emma Sharples said the formation of the 'willy-willy' can be caused by a variety of factors. She added: 'It's fairly rare to see the formation on snow. 'Snownado': Skiers and walkers were dwarfed on Cairngorm Mountain near Aviemore by the stunning spiralling pillar of snow The phenomenon seen in Scotland typically forms when a cold air mass passes over a warmer surface, heated by sunlight 'It's probably captured on camera less because there's not as many people up in the mountains, but they usually form in deserts or semi-arid ground, not normally on snow.' According to the Met Office, the air temperature at the nearby car park on the mountain was around 3C with the wind speed in nearby Aviemore blowing at around 8mph (5 knots) Share or comment on this article \nWhat's your view?
