The high court commented on the law and order situation after it was stunned on watching videos of rioting being played in the courtroom. Policemen were seen escorting rioters when they attacked the house of one Rafiq Salot. When the mob was ransacking the house and damaging the vehicles parked beside it, the policemen were silent spectators. Tearing into Gujarat police for its inaction against former BJP MP Dinu Bogha Solanki in connection with the case of rioting in Kodinar of October last year, Justice J B Pardiwala said, \"I want to say so many things, but I am restraining myself from making more comments.\" The court reminded the investigators, who were present in the courtroom, about their duties and asked them why they were armed with guns, when the cops expressed inability to take action against the strong mob. The court also questioned cops why they did not make any arrests in this case. The HC quashed the FIR lodged by the police inspector in this case, which was a toned down version of the incident. It directed for a new FIR on basis of a complaint filed by Jetunben Salot, the wife of Rafiq, whose house was attacked by a strong mob led by Solanki. The court directed CID (crime) to take up the investigation in this case. During the hearing, the high court got angry at the behaviour of police officials and said that their inaction in this case could have resulted in communal riots because the mob was armed with deadly weapons and attacked the house of a member of the minority community. Petitioner Salot's advocate Anand Yagnik had submitted CDs containing videos of the rioting in the HC and insisted on playing the videos in the courtroom by making allegations that the state authorities do not stop Solanki's terror in Kodinar.
