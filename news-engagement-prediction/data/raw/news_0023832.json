Terry, 36, is considering coaching among a list of post-playing options and has been studying towards his UEFA licence qualifications. On Wednesday he revealed an image featuring some of his notes, accompanied by the message: 'Always learning'. John Terry has provided an insight into his note-taking as Chelsea's captain studies coaching Terry's notepad details a series of systems and formations including defensive block work Terry's files and pads include notations on tactical manoeuvres and formations as well as work detailing the preparation for matches including team meetings. One note reads: 'Treat a meeting like a training session – prepare for a meeting and take and learn everything possible to help you improve – 10 minutes max.' Terry has spent time with Chelsea's youth sides and at times this season has been seen leading warm-downs for the substitutes after first-team matches. He has also undertaken some punditry work with Sky Sports. The centre back has been largely unrequired by Antonio Conte in the Premier League, playing just six league minutes since mid-September. And while the Italian values Terry's playing ability and leadership skills in his squad for now he says the skipper could one day make a good manager himself. The defender's extensive notes are linked to his desire to at least consider a coaching future Terry laughs with the other substitutes, warming-down at Stamford Bridge on Saturday 'When he decides to finish his career, he could have a good prospect to start a new career as a manager,' Conte said. 'He is clever and really good at understanding situations. But [only] when he is finished. For now, leave him to play.' Terry's predecessor as club captain at Chelsea has said it is his 'time to go' having watched him fall out of favour – saying it's just like when Terry ousted him 13 years ago. 'I left because they (Terry and William Gallas) were faster than me, better than me and it was my time to go – their time to shine – and now it's his time,' Desailly told Sportsmail . Antonio Conte has made it clear he believes Terry could have the attributes of a good boss 'It's great to see that he's been able to handle it. You are the captain, you have been put to the side a bit because other players are more suited for the tactics required, but you're still there present, you are still there focused. 'I'm happy because it's a different phase for John – leader as a first-choice but also leader as a second-choice. He's there to boost and to be present in the group so it's a different approach of John.'
