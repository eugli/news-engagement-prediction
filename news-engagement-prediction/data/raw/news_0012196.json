(Photo: Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports) \nHOUSTON – Ninety-one yards of green grass lay ahead. At the end, a chance at setting up the largest comeback in Super Bowl history. \nThe New England Patriots had played miserably to start Super Bowl LI Sunday against the Atlanta Falcons. In order to complete their march to their fifth Lombardi Trophy and erase a 25-point deficit, however, they would first need to tie the game. \nThis is how they saved their season and set up a game-winning touchdown drive in overtime to shock the Falcons, 34-28. \nMORE COVERAGE: Tom Brady suspects Super Bowl jersey was stolen after game \nThe drive started from New England’s own 9-yard line. The Patriots were down 28-20 with 3:30 left to play in the game. Quarterback Tom Brady received the play call in his helmet, leaned in, and relayed it to the 10 other players standing in the huddle, shouting so that they could hear him above the roar of the crowd. \nThere was no motivational speech. There was no epic pep talk. \n“You know what? You don’t need words at that point,” offensive tackle Nate Solder, who stood directly to Brady’s left in the huddle, told USA TODAY Sports. “You just need to hear the play, know what you’re doing, and get it done.” \nExcept the Patriots didn’t. Two quick incompletions put New England’s drive in peril. Brady got blasted on the first – the 16th time he had been hit by that point in the game, according to the FOX broadcast – and couldn’t connect with receiver Chris Hogan on a deep pass for the second. \nOn third-and-10, Hogan was lined up in the slot, from where the Falcons sent cornerback Brian Poole on a blitz, leaving Hogan free to run an out. \n“It was the look we wanted,” Hogan told USA TODAY Sports. “Tom made a good throw, and I just knew I had to make the play.” He hauled it in for a 16-yard gain. Though it was four-down territory, the Patriots had new life. \nA batted incompletion brought up second down, with 2:34 left to play. \nMORE COVERAGE: What's next for Patriots after Super Bowl? Questions on Tom Brady, Jimmy Garoppolo \nBrady fired a dart to Malcolm Mitchell the left sideline for 11 yards and another first down. \nThat set up what turned out to be the biggest play of the game. The most difficult catch, you could argue, in Super Bowl history. \nBrady flung a pass that Atlanta cornerback Robert Alford tipped in the air. It floated as Edelman – and three Falcons defenders – lunged for it as it tumbled to the turf. Edelman grasped it, propped up by Alford’s leg, but had to adjust the grip as it hung just inches from the ground. \n“It was one of the greatest catches I’ve ever seen,” Brady told reporters after the game. “I don’t know how the hell he caught it. I mean, I don’t think anybody – I don’t think he does, but that’s the way it goes.” \n“I was just trying to track it,” Edelman said. “It was a bang-bang play.” \nThe sideline erupted. \n“It changed the game,” cornerback Malcolm Butler told USA TODAY Sports as he left the stadium. “It got us amped. We needed it. That was clutch. Julian, man, you just don’t know the type of things this man do at practice. I jumped out of my seat and said ‘Wooo.’ ” \nOfficials reviewed the play. \nSaid Edelman: “I knew I had it.” \nIt put the Patriots at the Atlanta 41-yard line, with only 2:03 left to play. \nThree straight completions of 20, 13, and seven yards put New England all the way down to the 1-yard line. \nRunning back James White plowed it into the end zone over the right side of the line to put the score at 28-26 with 57 seconds to go. \nAll the New England needed was two more points. \n“We worked on those two-point plays all week,” Patriots coach Bill Belichick told reporters after the game. “I don’t know. (Offensive coordinator) Josh (McDaniels) and I had a sense that we may need a couple of them.” \nReceiver Danny Amendola was lined up to the far left, motioned inside, and caught a quick pass before being sprung forward by Hogan and Edelman blocks. Tie game. \nAnd in overtime, New England completed its mission by mounting an eight-play, 75-yard drive that was capped by White powering into the end zone to secure the title. \n“The odds of doing that were not very high,” Solder said, as defenders on the other side of the locker room sprayed champagne that soaked anyone nearby. \nMeanwhile, near the entrance of the locker room, Kraft handed out Padron cigars to players. “But we pulled it off.” \nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes . \nPHOTOS: Best of Super Bowl LI Like this topic?
