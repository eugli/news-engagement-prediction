It is the second largest chip maker in the world, behind Samsung.\nThe company is still struggling to recover after it emerged in 2015 that profits had been overstated for seven years, prompting the chief executive to resign .\nUK nuclear plant in limbo As well as detailing its losses, Toshiba is also widely predicted to announce it is scaling back its global nuclear business - and possibly getting out of the sector all together apart from its operations in Japan.\nAmong the projects that would impact heavily on is a planned new power plant in Cumbria in the UK.\nThe Moorside nuclear plant on the Cumbrian coast is due to open in the mid-2020s Toshiba has a 60% stake in Nugen, the company which has the contract to build the plant.\nShould the Japanese company pull out of the project, the UK would have to look for other backers to step in with South Korea's Kepco a likely candidate.\nAny changes to the current plans are expected to seriously delay the project, thought to eventually provide as much as 7% of the UK's energy needs.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/EBCB/production/_94636306_gettyimages-481438238.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33605638", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/416A/production/_91164761_moorside.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-14T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:54:40.253+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
