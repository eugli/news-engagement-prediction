But with Liam racing back to England, fans went into overdrive. \nFans rushed to social media yesterday to speculate on his reason for making a swift return. Fans have sparked rumours (Photo: ITV) Liam has returned to the UK (Photo: Getty Images Europe) \n\"Hold up, Cheryl is having the baby NOW?” wrote one excited fan. \nAs added: \"Cheryl’s super baby is coming.” \nDespite the wild speculation, both Cheryl and Liam have yet to break their silence over the claims. \nLiam's been in Los Angeles working on his debut solo album, which is due for release later this year. \nA source said recently: “Cheryl has been incredibly supportive of Liam and his music. She really wants him to do well, she knows what is like to have a solo career and how hard it is breaking out on your own. \n“They are both very excited about his career and of course about their new arrival. It’s a very happy time for both of them.” \nCheryl and Liam, who have never publicly confirmed news they're expecting a child, just celebrated their first anniversary together. Liam's pal spoke about the news recently (Photo: Getty) \nLiam's former bandmate confirmed the news recently however when he spoke about his excitement. \n“I’m looking forward to it,” he told the Daily Star. \n“Liam hasn’t said he’s nervous but I’m sure he is. I bet he can’t wait as well. It is a very exciting thing in your life.” \nMirror Celeb has reached out to their rep for comment.
