He, along with Von Bell, Sterling Moore and B.W. Webb were shown the door despite having table reservations ahead of time. The reason? They were deemed “too urban.” We pull up to @CirqueLeSoir where we have reservations and this is what they tell us!! @SterlingMoore @TheVonnBell7 @burtleyc @OhGi_3Dawg3 pic.twitter.com/vfKGcqUmxQ \n— Mark Ingram II (@MarkIngram22) February 28, 2017 They told us they were \"6 big guys\" that are too \"Urban\" but nobody taller than 5'11!! 😂😂🤔🤔 cc:saints roster 😂😂😂😂 \n— Mark Ingram II (@MarkIngram22) February 28, 2017 \nIngram shared a picture of himself and his five friends, wondering how they look “too urban” for a nightclub. \n— Mark Ingram II (@MarkIngram22) February 28, 2017 \nThe Saints will play the Dolphins in London next season, in addition to three other NFL games in the city. It’s a part of the NFL’s expanded schedule in London as the league is making a concerted effort to grow the game overseas. \nThis makes the incident particularly noteworthy, considering Ingram and his teammates will all be in England this coming October. Fortunately, the situation at Cirque Le Soir was the only negative experience the group had, according to Ingram, saying they’ve been treated well otherwise. Nonetheless we all can't wait to play out here @NFLUK next season!!! Gonna be crazy experience and I'm excited about it! I ❤️ England! \n— Mark Ingram II (@MarkIngram22) February 28, 2017 Everyone in England has been amazing so far!!! This was our first #TooUrban encounter entire trip! I ❤️ England! #TooUrban https://t.co/QbmMtkWcza ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T18:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T18:30:50.291+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
