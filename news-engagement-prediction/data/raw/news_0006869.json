Not only does it have some masti, some emotional sequences and stunning visuals, but also good music. With singers like Sukhwinder Singh, Rekha Bhardwaj, Sunidhi Chauhan and O.S. Arun lending their voices, it was always going to be out of the world and all the singers shine in the song. And while Vishal’s composition might not cater to the mainstream taste, Tippa will still be on everyone’s playlist as it instantly uplifts your mood. \nThe song starts with a sequence where Kangana is crying. Everyone around the actress come up to her and start consoling her. She gets back to normal, post which we see her play around, jump and dance while Shahid acts like a total snob. The actor is seen just looking at her with a straight face. Clearly they have had a lover’s tiff, but Kangana doesn’t care and keeps dancing around in rain. We even see her on top of the train, singing a few lines. All in all, the song is a visual treat and we see a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the number. It is a very refreshing song and you can listen to it on loop. Anyway, check out Tippa from Rangoon right here: \nDirected by Vishal Bhardwaj, Rangoon is a period drama. With a backdrop of World War II, we expect to see a lot of action, drama and suspense. Apart from that we will also see a love triangle between Shahid, Kangana and Saif Ali Khan in the movie. Anyway, check out the latest song Tippa above and stay tuned to BollywoodLife for all the exclusive dope about the movie right here!
