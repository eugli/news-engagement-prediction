To make matters even more tragic, Cleo McQueen was rushing to his side to confess her love when the tragedy unfolded and now Mac and his lover Lisa Loveday are left shattered by the secret of what happened? \nFans were hoping for a happy ever after for Cleo and Nathan on Valentine’s Day but Hollyoaks writers had other ideas and aired a final ending for Nathan after he discovered Mac and Lisa’s betrayal? \nBut, according to David Easter, who plays villainous Mac, this is just the start of the drama ahead. (Picture: Lime Pictures) \nSpeaking exclusively to Metro.co.uk, he revealed: ‘The aftermath is deeply traumatic, both for the grief and the fact that someone might find out about what happened. There are secrets still hidden and how and when they come out remains to be seen. We also have the funeral where Tabby comes back – which might be a lot different to what people might think. Tabby might be a little different towards Mac. \n‘There are lots of twists ahead and the devastation he feels sends him down a slippery slope – and a very dark path. Nathan was always there for Mac and his death will have massive repercussions.’ (Picture: Lime Pictures) \nSo how does Mac respond in the moments after the shocking death – when life for the Nightingales has changed forever? \nDavid continued: ‘He’s in total denial at first. At the moment no one knows Lisa and Mac were there but Lisa becomes tempted to open up to people about what happened and Mac needs to try and stop her. It goes from a love relationship to a detesting relationship. \n\n‘Mac will definitely will go down a very, very dark route. Everything implodes inside and he can’t cope with all of the lies he has told. The storyline is very macabre and Hollyoaks is great for doing that. There will be tough times – for Mac, for Lisa, for Marnie, for everyone. \n‘And if and when the truth all comes out, it’s bound to be massively huge. When the family know, it will surely cause hell…’ (Picture: Lime Pictures) \nIt’s certainly a devastating storyline – particularly for fans who were really rooting for Cleo and Nathan. And David admitted that he was as shocked as us when he found out what was ahead. \nHe agreed: ‘I know, it’s so sad, isn’t it? Jared has so many fans cos he’s a lovely boy but he couldn’t wish to go out on a better story. The episode is absolutely amazing and it is such a swansong for him. I hope people are really shocked by it – when we filmed the funeral scenes, Nathan was there so hopefully it’s a massive storyline. \n‘It took a lot of emotion to film and the aftermath is full on – the story is going to explode.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:47:51.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
