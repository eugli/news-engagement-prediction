The machines can be used by any dog, their defenders say, but the avalanche of online instructional videos show overwhelmingly that it is pit bulls — the chief breed used in dog fighting — doing the running. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story With brand names like Dogtrotter USA and the Game Changer, the largely homemade machines look something like miniaturized treadmills, but are typically not motorized. Dogs are tethered to an overhead bar and move the belt by running on it. Neither of the companies that make the Dogtrotter or the Game Changer responded to requests for comment. Dogtrotter devices have been recovered in several police operations, according to news reports . At the offices of the Humane Society of the United States in Gaithersburg, Md., Chris Schindler, the director for animal cruelty and fighting prevention, keeps as a teaching tool a slat mill recovered during a sting operation. Owning a running machine or making one hardly means that a person is involved in dog fighting — people living in apartments or with limited mobility might find them a practical way to exercise energetic dogs.

Credit Becky Harlan for The New York Times Dr. Richard Goldstein, the chief medical officer of the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, said the center used motorized treadmills to rehabilitate patients, adding that the machines must be monitored at all times by trained workers. Nonmotorized treadmills can be a cheaper and safer alternative for pet owners, he said, adding that sled dogs, for example, are often trained on treadmills before races so they can run indoors. “We understand that there is obviously abuse of the techniques to train dogs to strengthen their endurance,” Dr. Goldstein said, “but it is a legitimate tool for training dogs.” Slat mills are a preferred piece of equipment for dog fighters, said a man who trained and fought pit bulls across the United States for over 20 years, before quitting in 2010 and becoming an informant for animal rights groups and law enforcement. “You can be very discreet with your illegal activity. You can portray it as saying that it’s just exercise equipment,” said the man, who declined to be named because he is an informant. “The reality is, it’s all illegal and it is made to make these dogs fighting machines.” Experts say there is a strong correlation between fighting and the running tracks commonly sold on the web. “A lot of things can be inhumane in the wrong hands,” Mr. Schindler said. Dog fighting is illegal nationwide, and in 20 states, including New York, possession of slat mills is, too, if there is proof of intent to use them for dog fighting purposes. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “You’re not talking just about the mill itself, you’re talking about the totality of the evidence seized, that show this person is involved in dog fighting, which is inherently cruel,” Mr. Schindler said. Randall Lockwood, senior vice president for forensic sciences at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said that in the last two years in Baltimore alone, there had been close to 20 dog fighting busts and in nearly all of them a slat mill or similar device was found.

A regimen used to condition dogs to fight is called “a keep” and incorporates diets and exercises that differ from trainer to trainer. Many employ some kind of running device. To train a dog to run, the dog is usually confined to a running machine while food or even a live animal is placed just out of reach. Some instructional videos show dogs sprinting on separate mills, pointed at one another. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
