There's not much I could do really. I was standing on it at the last moment before it went fully under.\" \nAllan Campbell, who helped recover the vehicles, said it was \"a bit awkward\" because the ute was upside down on the bottom of the lake. \n04022017.

It went out probably 50 metres which I have never had one out that far before. We have done jobs like this before but regrettably with bodies, but this was good, there was not body recovery.\" \nDiver Steve Bell said the ute and boat was down about 11 metres. \n\"The truck was actually upside down and the trailer and boat were on top of the truck. So we had to get the boat off, then trailer off, the had to roll the truck the right way up...It's bad luck for the young fella.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T09:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:37:59.103+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
