It would appear to show our sitting president having a mental breakdown and/or fit in the presence of a foreign leader . \"You have a bunch of bad hombres down there,\" Trump told Pena Nieto, according to the excerpt seen by the AP. \"You aren't doing enough to stop them. I think your military is scared. Our military isn't, so I just might send them down to take care of it.\" \nThis would be the sitting president asserting that he may send the American military into Mexico... in a call with that nation's president. \nMexico's foreign relations department is so far denying that the leaked transcript is accurate. Shortly after the phone conversation between the two leaders, however, the Mexican president called off his planned meeting with Trump, with that nation's officials saying it would no longer be productiveâ€”and the Associated Press claims they were indeed given the official transcript by \"a person with access\" to it. The AP obtained that transcript after a Mexican reporter reported Tuesday that the conversation between the two had \"humiliated\" to the Mexican leader. \nSo the evidence suggests Donald Trump just threatened war with Mexico over unspecified \"bad hombres\". In other news, the call between Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcom Turnbull appears to have been almost as incoherent and hostile , suggesting he may indeed be out of his goddamn mind and incapable of conducting the duties of his office.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:24:34.803+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
