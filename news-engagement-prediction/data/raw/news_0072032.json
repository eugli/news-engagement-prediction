The roller coasters came to a screeching halt. And the many other rides vanished.\nSomeone with some spare cash and a deep craving for nostalgia, can now reclaim a piece of the old fun. It will only cost $5,500, just slightly more than it used to cost to purchase a ticket to the storied park.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Scott Knickerbocker, a Brattleboro, Vermont, resident who runs an antique shop in nearby Newfane, has turned to Craigslist to off-load a roughly 1-ton artifact from the days of yore: a steel-plated rocketship car that was once featured inside the park.\n“It’s a pretty cool item, and it’s, in essence, like its own attraction,” said Knickerbocker. “It’s something to look at. I don’t want to say it’s a museum piece, but in some ways it is.”\nThe rocketship, which some have said was set up at Whalom Park for family photo opportunities, has a stainless steel skin wrapped around a steel tubed frame, Knickerbocker said.\nAdvertisement\nWhen you step inside the ship — it’s about 16 feet long — there are four bench seats that can each fit two adults. Aside from a few dings and dents, the rocket is in fair condition, he said.\n“It’s unique. It’s obviously one-of-a-kind,” he said. “Where else are you going to find a damn rocket?”\nThe Fitchburg & Leominster Street Railway Co. opened Whalom Park in 1893, according to the Worcester Telegram and Gazette.\nOver the years, attractions were added. But as nearby amusement parks became theme parks, and beefed up their offerings with “thrill rides,” Whalom Park was slowly left in the dust.\nThe park suffered from bad weather and equipment failures, according to the Gazette, and attendance dwindled. Park equipment became rusty, and cutbacks were made.\nBy 2000, the owners decided to call it quits. The park was torn down in 2006, and a housing development now stands in its place, according to Globe archives .\nKnickerbocker got his hands on the rocketship through a friend, Chris Thompson, around a decade ago. Since acquiring the piece of history, it has either sat beneath a tarp behind a barn in Newfane, or used as a lawn ornament to entice customers to come visit his antique shop.\nThough the price may seem steep, Knickerbocker has already received several inquiries about the relic.\n“If I got the right offer I would let it go. I have had some low-ball offers,” he said. “I don’t think it’s an unreasonable price.”\nIf those interested buyers fall through, it shouldn’t be too difficult to find someone else. To this day, people turn to YouTube to watch decade-old videos about the park. In the comments sections, people often share fond childhood memories from the days when Whalom was in business.\n“I used to live in Lunenburg,” one person wrote this week. “Whalom Park held many memories for me — especially the roller skating rink.”\nBeneath a separate video posted in 2008 of Whalom Park’s “Flyer Comet” rollercoaster, someone recalled visiting his or her grandparents and riding the attraction.\n“Visited the park each Summer as I grew up in the mid 60’s through early 80’s,” the person wrote recently . “Always made it to Whalom.”\nOn top of that, a group called the “ New Whalom Cooperative, LLC ” was formed to try and build a family-friendly park in the original attraction’s memory. The group, whose goal is to resurrect Whalom and bring a high level of entertainment to the region, is in the midst of fund-raising.\nThe cooperative is hosting a social gathering “ to include a presentation on a New Whalom Park ” this week.\nWith the park still fresh in people’s minds, Knickerbocker believes it could be the thirst for the good-old-days that will serve as the driving force behind the sale of the rocketship.\n“I think people get pretty sentimental about things like this,” he said. “That’s a major factor as far as people taking interest in it.”\nSteve Annear can be reached at steve.annear@globe.com .
