Given Samsung is launching Galaxy S8 soon that will come in two sizes -- the Galaxy S8 Plus being a 6.2-inch phone, a Note series had been assumed dead. The Galaxy S8 is said to have a curved display bigger than Note 7's, an iris scanner for phone unlock and authentication, introduced on Note 7, and all other premium stuff. Samsung is also not doing away with the 3.5mm jack reportedly. So does that mean there will be no Note 8? Also Read: Moto G5 Plus, Nokia P1 and Xiaomi Mi 5C: Meet 3 most-awaited phones coming soon \nWe speculated so back in December, as many did on the demise of the popular and crazy Note 7. Samsung was said to have done with the Note brand because, why not? It was bruised enough by the battery fiasco that its transference to a bigger Galaxy S8 made sense. But the Galaxy S8 Plus was never said to have the S-Pen which left sufficient room for doubt. \nBy the end of January, with the recall almost completed, Samsung was in process of confirming the issues with Note 7. And it also confirmed that the company will keep working on the Note series and that you will get to see the next Note launched sometime later this year (around iPhone 8 launch?) \nA new leak, posted by gsmarena via @UniverseIce on twitter suggests that work has already begun on the new Note. The project is said to be code-named Biakal, which is one of the deepest lakes located in Siberia and the picture connected to the information shows a similar scene. The phone is rumoured to come with 4K display and the Bixby AI-based assistant that will debut on the Galaxy S8 this April.
