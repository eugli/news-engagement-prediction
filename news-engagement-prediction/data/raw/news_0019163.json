First, several of these actions will make little difference in the lives of most Americans, either because the actions have no real impact or because, like the refugee ban, they will inflict tremendous pain on already vulnerable populations without solving any pressing economic challenges American families face. \nThe president's first order, which directed agencies to undermine the Affordable Care Act, illustrates this first category. The order's reach is crippled by legal requirements written into the Affordable Care Act that cannot be set aside and the need to go through lengthy public comment in the limited areas where there is some flexibility. Only an act of Congress could repeal or change the law itself. Another executive order seeking to bolster domestic manufacturing does nothing more than call for a paper-pusher's review of barriers to creating new jobs. Meanwhile, not only does the refugee ban endanger the lives and well-being of heavily-vetted refugees, it will also not fulfill promises to create jobs, and is likely to backfire by endangering our national security. \nA second category of orders is more nefarious, because they will have a real impact and will hurt most Americans. These betray Trump's populist pledges during the campaign to stand up to Wall Street, and will benefit his wealthy friends and donors at the expense of the rest of us. Take, for example, that in the opening hours of the Trump administration, the Federal Housing Administration effectively raised mortgage premiums by 25 basis points – taking about $500 a year out of the pockets of average homeowners. \nThen Trump directed his administration to reverse an Obama administration rule that requires investment firms to act in your best interest when you pay them for advice. How is rolling this back good for Americans struggling to make ends meet and save for retirement? Banks say Trump's order is needed because offering unconflicted advice to families is too expensive – and that they'll offer less of it. Yet this doesn't pass the smell test. Of course banks make more when they can steer middle-class savings toward high-fee products that are in banks' own interest, but they would still do just fine if required to act in the best interest of clients. Already we've seen new services pop up to provide better, unbiased advice at a reasonable cost. That's the best part of our free market economy. \nHow does raising the costs of mortgages by $500 or freeing financial advisers to accept kickbacks without acting in your best interest help the average American? It doesn't. But this is the real agenda of President Donald Trump: Make empty promises – and sign hollow pieces of paper – to help working Americans, and then more quietly sell them out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:20:44.648+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
