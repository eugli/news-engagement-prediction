The Star Wars variant of mac and cheese is limited edition, and the Nanaimo family has snapped up every last box they can find.\n\nBotwright took to social media to help track down more of the pasta, hoping anyone with a spare box or two might be inspired to donate it for Everett.\nSince he made the post on Sunday , the family has gotten inundated with offers of support, including from someone in Newfoundland, and now think Everett will have his favourite food available for some time to come. \n\n\"It feels like there's going to be an avalanche, the amount of people who have said 'I've found an entire flat in Burnaby and I want to send them all to you.' I think I'm going to need a storage locker.\"\n\nBotwright and his wife are hopeful this will be the beginning of Everett enjoying even more foods. \n\"He hasn't found this much joy in food in a while.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:52:17.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
