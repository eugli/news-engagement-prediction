Narenasagaran. \nHe said many policemen – including officers – were in this situation as they had taken loans which they had difficulty repaying. \nHe said some had monthly loan repayments amounting to 40% of their salary, which made it hard for them to make ends meet. \n\"We should not easily give in to demands by family members if we cannot afford it,\" he told reporters after a training parade for 199 police constables at the Police Training Centre here Saturday. \nHe said policemen were required to get their superiors' approval before applying for loans, with repayments deducted from their salaries and stated in their salary slips. \nHe said the problem arose when they made loans without knowledge of their superiors. \nIn his speech, Narenasagaran advised police trainees to embrace the concept of lifelong learning to improve themselves and become capable and dedicated policemen with integrity. – Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T16:33:13.720+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
