He declared $300 worth of goods.\nThe man was driving a 2015 electric car with U.S. plates that he told customs officials a friend had loaned him for a few months.\nThe border guard decided to send the man for a secondary examination, where his story began to unravel.\nEvidence of purchase found on phone\nDuring that inspection, officers searched the car as well as the man's cellular phone, which he unlocked for them.\nAgents discovered emails and an electronic invoice confirming the man had purchased the car in the U.S.\n'The single best thing you can do to save time returning to Canada is to simply be open and honest with the CBSA officer.' - Leanne Sullivan, CBSA At that point he confessed, CBSA said, admitting he had just bought the car in the U.S. CBSA temporarily seized the vehicle and confiscated the man's NEXUS card.\nCustoms officials determined the vehicle had a duty value of $12,084 and ordered the man to pay a penalty of $6,646.\nCBSA said if the man had simply declared his purchase, it would have cost him $700 in duty and taxes, plus a $295 Registrar of Imported Vehicles (RIV) fee — a total just shy of $1,000.\nThe driver still had to pay those duties, taxes and fees — as well as the penalty — before his vehicle was released to him.\nPenalty could have been even stiffer According to CBSA, the driver could have faced even harsher penalties including the permanent seizure of the vehicle as well as criminal charges.\nCBSA also keeps records of all infractions on its computer system, so the man may well face close scrutiny on future cross-border trips.\nIn the media release, Leanne Sullivan, CBSA's chief of operations for the Prescott port of entry, said there are lessons here for other cross-border shoppers.\n\"The single best thing you can do to save time returning to Canada is to simply be open and honest with the CBSA officer. If you are not sure about what to declare, don't hesitate to ask a CBSA officer at a port of entry,\" Sullivan advised.\nHave customs officers asked to unlock your mobile phone at the border? If you've been asked to unlock your phone at the Canada-U.S. border, CBC Ottawa would like to hear from you.
