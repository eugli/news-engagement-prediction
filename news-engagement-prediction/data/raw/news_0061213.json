When the woman's friend came to her rescue, the gang attacked him as well. \nActing on their complaint, the police later arrested those involved in the incident. \nUnfortunately, the young man was highly upset after the incident and hardly spoke to anyone, his friend claimed. \nKerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had earlier taken a strong note of the incident and asked the state police chief to take strict action on incidents of moral policing incidents.
