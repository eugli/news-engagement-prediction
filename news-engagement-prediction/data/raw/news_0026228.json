Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nSometimes the most fun you have on Fifa 17 is shortly before the game starts - when you play the skill games. \nThere's passing, shooting, defending, set-pieces and even dribbling. \nAdmit it, when you're playing against your mate, how often do you forget about the actual game you're supposed to be playing and instead get caught competing in the skill challenges? \nWe've all done it. \nWell six lucky stars down at Chelsea 's training ground were fortunate enough to play a skill game recently... in real life. It's just like the game! (Photo: EA SPORTS FIFA /Youtube) \nEden Hazard, Thibaut Courtois and Michy Batshuayi were put into one team, Team Belguim. While N'Golo Kante, Kurt Zouma and Nathaniel Chalobah were grouped into another, Team Rest of the World. \nIn three rounds, the boys had to collect as many points as possible by kicking the balls into the baskets. Eden and co are less than impressed with Batshuayi's attempt (Photo: EA SPORTS FIFA /Youtube) \nIt's 1200 for the big basket, 1600 for the medium-sized one and 2000 for the smaller target. \nAt the end of round one, Team Rest of the World lead 0-1600 - thanks to Kante's excellent aim. Zouma on point (Photo: EA SPORTS FIFA /Youtube) \nAnd things don't get much better for Team Belgium. At the end of round two, Hazard is the only one to have acquired points for his side and the group trail 1600-4800. \nBut a late surge from the round three underdogs sees Hazard, Courtois and Batshuayi all score points. \nWith the scores standing at 6000-4800 to Team Belgium, it's all on Chalobah to either draw or win the game for Team Rest of the World. The final scoreboard (Photo: EA SPORTS FIFA /Youtube) \nThe 22-year-old steps like a champ and gets a stunning 2000 pointer. Team Rest of the World win! \nCan we have go now please? poll loading Is FIFA 17 the best football game yet? 0+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T21:20:55.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
