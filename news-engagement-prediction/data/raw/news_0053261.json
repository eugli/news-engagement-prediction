Arvai, 24, was unaware that the transaction was part of a sting operation. \nThe Stubhub broker called Northgate Mall security, where the two met to do the exchange, and alerted a police officer ahead of the transaction that Arvai was likely pedaling fake tickets. \nArvai was charged with four counts of scalping tickets, four counts of counterfeiting a trademark, and four counts of obtaining property by false pretenses, according to the Durham Herald-Sun report.
