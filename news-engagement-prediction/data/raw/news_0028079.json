Bill Shorten calls for commonwealth lead on reparation for stolen generations – politics live Read more \nOn Monday evening One Nation’s Malcolm Roberts told the Senate that his party, which has three senators and is likely to soon gain a fourth after Rodney Culleton’s disqualification , does not support the bill. \nThe government has now removed the bill from the Senate notice paper. \nRoberts said that he recognised the benefits of internships but the PaTH scheme was “simply a subsidy to make work, and not a fulfilling job”. \nHe criticised payroll tax, which he said paid for the scheme and was “killing employment”. \nRoberts asked why the PaTH scheme did not have a cost-benefit analysis and questioned its value for money. \n“We have an apprenticeship scheme, which the leader of our party, Senator Hanson, will be discussing in more detail,” he said, flagging an alternative plan that Pauline Hanson is expected to announce on Tuesday. \nNick Xenophon Team senator Stirling Griff told the Senate PaTH was a “positive step” that his party supported in principle but warned of several problems if the government implemented the program without legislation.

This would undermine the intention of helping the jobseeker afford the costs that come with applying for or starting a new job.” \nGriff said NXT would move an amendment to review the scheme after two years and would suggest other changes including lengthening the period the subsidy was paid over. \nHe said this would make it harder for employers “lured by the subsidy on offer and on offer and ... intent on exploiting it” to take on an intern as cheap labour and dump them soon after the subsidy ends. \nGuardian Australia contacted the employment minister, Michaelia Cash, for comment.
