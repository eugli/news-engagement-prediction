The main thread of the skit revolved around Steve Bannon, who was played by the grim reaper. \nAlec Baldwin was at it once more when he returned to this week's Saturday Night Live to once again give it to Donald Trump. \nBaldwin, who does an uncanny impression, skewed the president for another tough week after actual Trump got major pushback for newly enacted policies and butted heads with world leaders. \nBaldwin's Trump, wearing a Russian lapel flag, threatened Australia and Mexico with war over refugees and the wall, respectively. \nBaldwin also worked in the fictitious \"Bowling Green massacre\" and Trump's actual feud with new Apprentice host Arnold Schwarzenegger. \nThe main thread of the skit revolved around Steve Bannon, who was played by the grim reaper, giving the Trump character awful advice, which of course he followed. \nBaldwin, who started doing the impression during the campaign season, has been very vocal in his criticisms of Trump and has said over social media numerous times he believes the former reality star is unfit for office. \nTrump on multiple occasions has taken the bait and blasted the sketch show — which he host in the past — and Baldwin, accusing the program and actor of essentially character assassination. \nBaldwin was even criticizing Trump hours before the show aired this week. 1-Trump is, quite simply, a man who was never embraced by his hometown, by NY society. Not even middle-of-road Repubs. Always peripheral. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T11:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T06:55:55.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
