Moving to the cloud is not an overnight exercise and takes planning and proper expertise.\nFor this reason, Activate-Telecoms has looked at the things involved and some questions that should be asked when making the move to Cloud.\nActivate specialises in demystifying the Cloud for businesses and talking to specific key areas.\nHere are some reasons it’s worth making the move to Cloud:\nEnhanced security Cutting-edge technology Access from anywhere in the world at any time Improved uptime and reliability Capacity and scalability Great turnaround times in terms of upgrades Cost savings Storage of data ERP Green environment Redundancy One major discussion that needs to be dealt with, though, is how will the data move from your ‘device’ to your Cloud environment that is based in Ireland or some other distant location?\nFor a company that is sitting in a major Metro, this may be easy since Fibre is readily available, and it offers good speeds that will result in a good experience.\nOther people are less lucky and may only have slower connections, such as ADSL available to them, making the move to Cloud a harder project to roll out.\nThe next issue is to decide what should be moved into the cloud – just Pbx and voice, email or perhaps deciding to move everything including exchange servers?\nActivate-Telecoms are a company that specialise in rolling out bespoke environments from Hosted Pbx’s and voice solutions all the way through to Office365 roll outs.\n“We do research on having the correct data connections and that you are utilising them correctly,” says Activate.\n“We sit and plan your migration with you and we take care as if it were our own business.”\nThere are many topics that can be discussed when going cloud from Security, timelines of roll out and how this will actually work.\nThese questions can be answered by Activate, who can help you house everything under one roof.\nThe time has come to move, be safer, be more effective, be more productive and save money while doing this.\nFor more information, visit the Activate-Telecoms website or contact them today on 011 081 9911.\nThis article was published in partnership with Activate-Telecoms.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:58:40.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
