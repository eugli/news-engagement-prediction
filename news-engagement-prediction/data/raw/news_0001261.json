(Photo: NBA) \nSteph Curry was on fire in the first half of the Warriors' game against the Hornets on Wednesday night, and the bench absolutely loved it. Curry scored 26 points (8/10 from deep!!!) and seven assists as Golden State took a commanding 77-56 at the HALF. \nWhile Curry got open to drain one of his threes late in the second quarter, Charlotte's Marvin Williams got a crossed up.

Some of them fell out of their seats and onto the floor. \nThe Warriors bench can barely handle how hot Curry is.
