He’s been linked with moves away for a good few years now but it looks as though a transfer is finally materialising. The destination? Manchester City. Change of agents \nAS report that he’s changed representation and this could be a huge hint about where he’ll end up. Formerly a client of Gestifute, an agency run by Jorge Mendes, he’s switched to Media Base Sports – run by a certain Pere Guardiola. \nPep’s brother will now look after the affairs of William, who’s also wanted by Real Madrid. Guardiola is believed to want to beef up his midfield in the next transfer window. Having registered their interest with Sporting, City could engage in a bidding war with Madrid for the Portugal international who had a starring role in their Euro 2016 win. Loading tags...
