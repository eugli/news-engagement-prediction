(PTI) Well done, Mukesh Ambani . In just 170 days, the richest Indian has signed up 100 million customers for his fourth-generation mobile service. That growth, bruising rivals and triggering a wave of industry consolidation, was explosive but predictable — Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. was offering Jio for free.\nTime taken to reach 100 million Jio subscribers: 170 days\nProgress will be harder now. The existing median revenue per user of leading Indian telcos such as Bharti Airtel Ltd. is about $4.50 a month, according to Credit Suisse Group AG, very close to the introductory price that Ambani announced. That median is bound to shift lower as rivals try to prevent their better-paying customers from switching to Jio.\nIf Ambani can double the number of subscribers, and get at least $4 from each of them, investors who endured seven lean years will get a decent harvest. Anything less, and Wednesday’s market euphoria over Reliance may be short-lived.\nYou may also like to watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:32:27.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
