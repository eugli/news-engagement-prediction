Here’s a glimpse of Salman Khan training for the underwater sequence in the film and he was getting help from popular scuba diving instructor Anees Adenwala. From what we hear, unlike other cases, the actor did not require scuba or diving gear for practice since he is a great swimmer. Exclaiming that Salman Khan is a water baby was trainer Anees was all praises for Salman and how he took some lapses even in cold water as a warm up session. He also had a chat with him about the scuba instructions about the breathing and how to manage the buoyancy among others.
