I need to whoop her right now,” she said on Facebook. \nBregoli gained internet notoriety for her defiant catchphrase “cash me ousside” that she made to a disapproving audience on an episode of Dr. Phil last September about out-of-control kids. \nShe was even screaming the phrase on the plane during the scuffle. \nBregoli, her mother, and the third passenger were taken off the flight and banned for life from the airline, TMZ reported. \nSpirit Airlines wouldn’t confirm the names of those involved but did release a statement saying: “Police removed three passengers from Spirit flight 310 during the boarding process at LAX Monday night following an altercation. The customers were refunded and refused service.” \nBregoli is scheduled for another appearance on Dr. Phil Friday on CBS2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T14:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:40:27.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
