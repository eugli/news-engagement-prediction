A popular video claims that sharing \"copy and paste\" Facebook status updates leaves social media users vulnerable to hacking. 0 CLAIM Publishing \"copy and paste\" and \"don't share\" status messages on Facebook leave users vulnerable to hacking. See Example(s) EXAMPLES Collected via e-mail, February 2017 \nThis isn’t a rumor per se, but I wanted to ask about it. Someone posted a video on facebook that showed how user accounts can be hacked or cloned. The video claims that the many posts floating around on facebook with requests that end with “please copy and paste this and don’t share” enable potential hackers to then search for strings in these posts and see everyone who has done the ‘copy and paste’. Is this true? \nDoes “copy and paste” put you in danger of being targeted by hackers any more than “share”? \nThat copy and pasting will allow hackers to get into your facebook account. false false ORIGIN \nOn 6 February 2017, fitness marketer Antony Newby published a video advancing the claim that “copy and paste” Facebook status updates left users unwittingly vulnerable to people who wanted to hack into their social media accounts and, by extension, their computers: \n\nThe narrator of the video walks viewers through his theory of copy and paste hacking, claiming that anyone with bad intentions can copy a portion of any circulating status update, paste it into the search bar, and find everyone on social media who has shared that message. \nAlthough the video claims to provide information about securing accounts, it instead just illustrates lack of familiarity with Facebook’s security protocols. Locating users using a search string of text does not make their accounts any more vulnerable to hacking, and we found absolutely no evidence to suggest that Facebook scammers target people with status updates. Even if Facebook scammers did unnecessarily target users with searches, they would still need an individual’s password to log in as that user — but if they had those credentials, there would be no need for hackers to target people sharing “copy and paste” status updates. \nBest practices for Facebook security include two-factor authentication , by which each login is verified as legitimate. Unauthorized access should not be confused with account cloning , a known issue, but one that does not involve anyone accessing your account without permission (instead using your public photographs and information to solicit money or personal information from your friends and family). Copying and pasting a status update does not expose login information to Facebook scammers.
