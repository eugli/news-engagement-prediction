(Photo: Provided by Carmel) 495 CONNECT 8 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCarmel has activated a traffic-metering signal at the roundabout-style interchange at 136th Street and Keystone Parkway. \nThe roundabout becomes backed up in the morning and evening due to students going to and from nearby Carmel High School, according to a news release. Five thousand students attend classes there. \nThe meter will turn red only during long backups to keep traffic flowing, according to the news release. Most of the time, the signal will be inactive and the roundabout will function normally. \n\"Those who travel through this area on school days are aware of the backups that occur, especially on 136th Street and on the northbound ramp from Keystone Parkway,” said City Engineer Jeremy Kashman, in a prepared statement. “This metering system is the most efficient manner of relief for this congestion that is only occurring during peak times before and after school.\" \nThe signal cost $88,000.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:13:09.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
