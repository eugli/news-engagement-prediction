Rec Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan is the favorite to win the NFL MVP. But before that award is announced, Ryan already has won one already: Offensive Player of the Year. Ryan, who is getting ready to play in his first ever Super Bowl Sunday night against the New England Patriots , has been Atlanta’s franchise quarterback since he was drafted in 2008. He has been also one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL. He has a huge arm and superb accuracy. The 31-year-old quarterback has always had amazing stats, but he took his game to a different level in 2016. While the Falcons’ offense has its fair share of dynamic players like receiver Julio Jones and running back Devonta Freeman , Ryan was responsible for plenty of big plays. Whenever Atlanta needed a big play this season, the veteran signal caller delivered. Ryan led the Falcons to an 11-5 record, and they clinched the second seed in the NFC. His excellent season is the reason why he was awarded the NFL Offensive Player of the Year. Ryan is also the first Falcons player in franchise history to win the award. The four-time Pro Bowler threw for 4,944 yards, which was second-most in the NFL. He threw 38 touchdowns against just seven interceptions. Atlanta also had the top-scoring offense in 2016. Ryan also made a lot of big plays in the fourth quarter, including against the Green Bay Packers in Week 8. Down 32-26 with 38 seconds left in the game, Ryan threw an 11-yard game-winning touchdown pass to receiver Mohamed Sanu. Atlanta won 33-32. Ryan is the catalyst for the success of this offense, and he had a great season in 2016. Because of his arm, talent and poise, the Falcons are an offensive juggernaut, and he earned Offensive Player of the Year honors.
