No curse or spell will be formed against President Trump, or those who abet him.\"\nThe witches, though, seem undeterred.\nTRAVEL BAN: Texas colleges stand to lose big if Trump's immigration policy is imposed\nFor good measure, they plan on repeating the effort ritually - \"To be performed at midnight on every waning crescent moon until he is removed from office.\"\nDid the spell work? It just depends on how someone sees Trump's actions and whether his policies and politics are seen as harmful.\nIf you’re looking an idea that’s a little more outside the box to resist Republican Donald Trump; a group of witches has planned on casting a “mass spell” on the President.
