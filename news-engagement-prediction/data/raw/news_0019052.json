Both the phones have been leaked countless times, and based on buyer feedback; the G5 Plus is the 'more awaited' one of the lot. Someone apparently just got hold of a Moto G5 Plus before launch for testing purposes and the gentleman was kind enough to share an image of the phone in question on Reddit . \nThankfully, the alleged Moto G5 Plus in the leaked image includes the protective plastic on the handset's display, giving out key specs of the upcoming phone. The most important thing to note here is that the phone is seen carrying a 5.2-inch (1080p) display which when you consider its predecessor would seem a little surprising. The Moto G5 Plus is probably not a 5.5-inch phone like the Moto G4 Plus because the phone (as also mentioned in the picture) will be powered by a 2GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor and Lenovo already has a Moto Z Play with similar screen size and processor specs.

The phone is seen sporting a 12-megapixel camera on the rear with a 'rapid focus' system and a 3,000mAh battery with support for Motorola's proprietary Turbo Charging. \nWhile the Moto G4 Plus is an all-plastic phone, the Moto G5 Plus is likely to take the all-metal route. The Moto G4 Plus is powered by a 1.5GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 processor clubbed with Adreno 405 GPU. It is available in two options: 2GB RAM and 16 GB memory and 3GB RAM and 32 GB memory. The phone supports expandable storage. \nThe Moto G4 Plus also sports a 16-megapixel camera on the rear with f/2.0 aperture, hybrid autofocus (phase detection plus laser autofocus) and dual-LED (dual tone) flash. On the front, it comes with a 5-megapixel camera. The Moto G4 Plus is backed by a 3,000mAh battery.
