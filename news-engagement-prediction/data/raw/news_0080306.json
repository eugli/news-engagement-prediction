It is understood that others are with the injured climber at the bottom of the hole. \nSenior Sergeant Blair Hall from Nelson police said emergency services were responding to a report of a caving accident at the hole on top of Takaka Hill, northwest of Nelson. \nRobin Reeve, of New Zealand Land Search and Rescue, said LandSAR was setting up a repeater to enable communications between the SAR base at Motueka and rescuers at the site.

It drops to an underground river that emerges below and flows into Gorge Creek and then into the Takaka River. \nSeveral scenes from Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy were filmed in the complex of caves at the bottom of the shaft. \nSituated in a remote part of Takaka Hill in Golden Bay with little to no cellphone reception, Harwoods Hole is a 45-minute walk from the Canaan car park, through distinctive limestone rock formations.â€‹ \nMORE TO COME", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:30:40.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
