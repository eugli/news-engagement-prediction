Thailand's notorious Tiger Temple \nThe main welfare concerns witnessed by the investigators at these tourist venues include: Tiger cubs cruelly separated from their mothers, two to three weeks after they are born Young cubs used as photo props with tourists; constantly viewed and mishandled hundreds of times a day, which can lead to stress and injury Tigers being punished to stop aggressive unwanted behavior. One staff member told our researchers that starvation is used to punish the tigers when they make a ‘mistake’ Most tigers were housed in small concrete cages or barren enclosures with limited access to fresh water. 50% of the tigers we observed were in cages with less that 20sqm per animal, a far cry from the 16-32km they would roam in a single night in the wild More than one in ten (12%) of the tigers we observed showed behavioral problems; such as repetitive pacing and biting their tales. These behaviors most commonly occur when animals feel they can’t cope with stressful environments or situations.
