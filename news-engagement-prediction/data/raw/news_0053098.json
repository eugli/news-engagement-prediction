A state that calls for Israel’s destruction? \n“A state whose territory will be used immediately for radical Islam?” \nAt the press conference Mr Netanyahu declined to give detailed comment on reports he is being investigated for allegedly accepting gifts from Australian billionaire James Packer. \nMr Netanyahu is in Australia to hold talks with Mr Turnbull as part of a historic four-day visit.
