I believe it's a feeling we share, us 'normal people', us 'regular folk'. We feel this too. It might be an age thing; we grew up with her, watching her, laughing at/with her. Watching her be brilliant in a bikini and snorkel, or all fur coat and tiny white knickers, wishing we could be half so brave. Our own mortality is now reinforced by the death of another from our group. A body bag wheeled into her apartment a blunt reminder that life is short and the end is not pretty, no matter how beautiful you were. It might be we are struggling because she died alone. Seemingly lay there for anything up to a week before anyone noticed. This is my version of the saddest death of all. Ms Hopkins said the socialite (left at her birthday party in 1998 and right in the 90s) was 'a huge heart inside a tiny frame' and never created the spotlight for herself She even managed to make her godfather, Prince Charles (pictured together in 2003), seem normal, a man just like the rest of us, Ms Hopkins writes We just moved my grandfather into a place with 24/7 care for exactly this reason. Just in case. So he would never be alone. Never lie there all chilly with no one to make him comfy until we came rushing to keep him company. I have reconciled myself with dying; a year ago I needed to. But to die alone and for no one to notice makes death so much more stark. The invisible threads of life that connect us so strongly to a handful of others — mums, husbands or wives, children, friends, bosses; people who would wonder why you hadn't texted or called — none of them were apparently there for TPT, though, of course, we don’t yet know the full facts. No spider’s web of support shared with others who would feel the vibrations of her life, sense her moving about — and scuttle to her aid when the lines went still. Ms Palmer-Tomkinson was found dead in her flat in London yesterday afternoon. She is pictured left, with her close friend Ivan Massow at Annabel Goldsmith's party in in 2014, and right in November,when she revealed she was being treated for a non-malignant growth Police are pictured outside her Earl's Court flat after she was found dead shortly yesterday I can accept we might die alone. I think I might prefer it, to save anyone the drama. But I wouldn't want to lie alone for a week, too. Waiting to be found. Waiting for someone to notice. I think that's partly it: the loneliness of it all. But the worst of it is the contrast between the way she died and the widescreen way she lived. Flailing about on the floor in the dark, a soft moth dying in the cold, having flown so brilliantly, so close to the sun. A beautiful Icarus. A massive life, lived big. A huge heart inside a tiny frame. Ms Hopkins (pictured) said all of us would like to have felt as free as Tara Always cuddling or hugging. A girl who seemed to be like the rest of us, loving her family and friends, making spectacular cock-ups and being brilliantly batty like we want to imagine posh people always are. She was old money. I've known a few — houses messy but somehow still grand, dilapidated but fabulous all the same. Just like Tara. She even managed to make her godfather, Prince Charles, seem normal, a man just like the rest of us, capable of hugging and laughing, a father having fun with his boys. She never created the spotlight for herself, manufacturing attention with a smartphone and soft focus. No tragic pictures of an oiled arse or leaking boobs inflated for display. She brought the light, became the party, said yes when the sensible said no. How we would all love to be so free. We took shelter in our safe lives and sensible jobs, thought buying a lottery ticket was a risk — and often lived vicariously through her, instead. The sanctimonious may tut tut tut. But she's a secret part of many of us. A braver part than many of us. She described her life as being like that of Alice in Wonderland: 'I fall down the rabbit hole and there are teddy bears’ picnics and Mad Hatters and tea parties going on all around me, but somehow I manage to climb back up. Then, just as I poke my head out the top, I go falling back down again. But I will get out. I will.’ I think we all believed she would, that she’d keep going, keep scrambling back up. She really was Alice in Wonderland, and she lived a fantastic dream. Near the end, Tara lived quietly in the margin of life, between the light and the dark, between breath and air. Only this time, the lights went out for good. Breath became air. And she never made it back up out of the hole. I’d like to think she is back off up the mountain now, way up above the clouds, off once again to fly close to the sun.
