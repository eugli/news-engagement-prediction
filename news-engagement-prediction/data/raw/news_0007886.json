And civil complaints against Nassar, Michigan State and USA Gymnastics, the governing body of the sport, are mounting by the week.\nHours before Simon's statement, an anonymous woman filed a motion in federal court in Michigan seeking to join an existing lawsuit there — pointing out, as others also have, that Michigan State investigated Nassar after a patient complaint in 2014.\nRelated: FBI Says Gymnastics Doctor Larry Nassar Recorded Abuse on Go Pro\nNo charges were brought at that time, and the school allowed Nassar to stay on staff and continue treating patients as long as he kept skin contact to a minimum and had a chaperone present during \"sensitive\" procedures, his personnel record shows.\nWhen the school fired Nassar, it said an investigation showed he broken those rules and had also hid a 2004 police investigation. The 2014 complaint against him has since been reopened.\nNassar has denied molesting any patients, with his lawyers saying that any procedures he performed were medically sound. He has pleaded not guilty to abusing the family friend and to the pornography charges.", "external_links": ["http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_21426262", "http://player.theplatform.com/p/2E2eJC/nbcNewsOffsite?guid=nc_olympicdoc_161123", "http://tve_static-snappytvpoc.nbcuni.com/snappy/caption/NBC_News/559/727/2016-09-30T22-46-42.633Z--195.034.mp4.vtt", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/4tRSMnETRE0e", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201611/nc_doctorarraigned1122_1920x1080.nbcnews-ux-440-240.jpg", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/201609/2016-09-30T22-47-46-366Z--1280x720.jpg", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/201611/NC_doctorarraigned1122_1920x1080.jpg", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/eDqWXVb6E0OZ?mbr=true", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201609/2016-09-30t22-47-46-366z--1280x720.nbcnews-ux-800-440.jpg", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201609/2016-09-30t22-47-46-366z--1280x720.nbcnews-ux-1240-700.jpg", "http://player.theplatform.com/p/2E2eJC/nbcNewsOffsite?guid=Nn_sgo_athletes_abuse_160930", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/ISTgF7ToZ7_D?mbr=true", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201611/nc_doctorarraigned1122_1920x1080.nbcnews-ux-360-200.jpg", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201611/nc_doctorarraigned1122_1920x1080.nbcnews-ux-800-440.jpg", "http://nbcnews.to/2drle8I", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201611/nc_doctorarraigned1122_1920x1080.nbcnews-ux-1080-600.jpg", "http://media.snappytv.com/captions/928000/387p387/2016-09-30T22-46-42.633Z--195.034.mp4.srt", "http://president.msu.edu/communications/speeches-statements/letter-spartan-community-2017-02-03.html", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/cckjqjgdvNF2", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/5Of3WECUSqcE?mbr=true", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201609/2016-09-30t22-47-46-366z--1280x720.nbcnews-ux-440-240.jpg", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201609/2016-09-30t22-47-46-366z--1280x720.nbcnews-ux-1080-600.jpg", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201611/nc_doctorarraigned1122_1920x1080.nbcnews-ux-1240-700.jpg", "http://nbcnews.to/2gfCG1l", "http://feed.theplatform.com/f/2E2eJC/nnd_20381145", "http://link.theplatform.com/s/2E2eJC/7PyJeCho_MVX?mbr=true", "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/j/msnbc/components/video/201609/2016-09-30t22-47-46-366z--1280x720.nbcnews-ux-360-200.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-04T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T09:22:33.634+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
