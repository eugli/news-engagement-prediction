Irae Simone, TJ Perenara and Quade Cooper. Source: FOX SPORTS \nSean Maloney, Fox Sports commentator ( @seanny202 ) \nThe Reds. \nMore specifically: George Smith. \nDoes everyone realise, as a 36-year-old he qualifies for Golden Oldies? \nLet that sink in, you front up for a GO carnival — take your pre-game shot of Port as is custom, then look up and see George Smith. \nChristy Doran, Foxsports.com.au journalist ( @christypdoran ) \nA new beginning. \n2016 was a hell of a year for Australian rugby. \nOther than the Brumbies, our Super Rugby sides started slowly and never recovered. \nDitto the Wallabies. \nLessons have been learnt, however, and there will be no repeat this season. \nIt’s often said that when the Reds perform, Australian rugby is stronger for it. \nI think that will be the case. \nGreg Martin, former Wallaby \nI can’t wait to see the Reds’ imposing forward pack intimidating teams. Rona makes his mark \n2) Who will top the Australian conference and why? \nHoiles: The Reds and the Waratahs will make the finals too. \nNick Stiles has managed to put together a great list of players. \nThey have a very good balance of young guys (Andrew Ready, Lukhan Tui and Taniela Tupou) on the way up and they will benefit by playing alongside some very experienced players (James Slipper, Stephen Moore, George Smith and Quade Cooper). \nClark: The Waratahs. \nDespite losing a lot of experience they have still named six Wallabies in the forward pack and four in the backs, with another two on the bench for week one. \nIf they all remain injury free they will be hard to beat. \nBoth the Reds and Rebels will keep them honest all season long. \nMcArdle: For the reasons mentioned above, I think the Reds are the team to beat on Australian soil. \nThe Waratahs will be tough to beat and if the Rebels can keep their best players on the park they’ll be in for a good year. \nMaloney: I don’t know who finishes top, but I’m happy to have a fiver on the Force finishing third at the least. \nWhy? \nI think Dave Wessels will get the best out of the guys there and their roster looks stronger than it has in quite a while. \nDoran: The Waratahs will give them a run for their money, but the Reds will be back with a vengeance in 2017. \nAfter a few years of pain and misery, the Reds will once again be the kings of Australian rugby. \nQuade Cooper will ensure the Reds rediscover their mojo. \nHe is fit, fresh and has a point to prove. \nHis combination with Karmichael Hunt and Samu Kerevi will be one to watch. \nBut what will make Cooper all the more threatening is the pack he is playing behind. \nThey tick all the boxes: experience and raw talent in the front-row, size and skill in the locking department and, with George Smith on board, the most versatile back-row in the competition. \nTogether, they will give Cooper the time and confidence he needs to pull the strings. \nMartin : I say the Reds, on the back of a new attitude, George Smith and a super scrum. \nQuade’s looking good and Karmichael Hunt is looking like Digby Ioane, but with ball skills. DHP re-signs until 2019 \n3) Who will be the Australian breakout star? \nHoiles: Jed Holloway. \nWe’ve seen what he can do in glimpses, but I believe he has plenty more to give. \nHe’s injured for the start of the season, but he could be a regular member of the Wallabies by the end of the year if he plays to his potential. \nClark: Irae Simone. \nThe Shute Shield rookie of the year and the NRC player of the year last season should be ready to take it to the next level. \nMcArdle: He’s missing the first round through injury but if Marika Koroibete can reacquaint himself with the game he could be a try-scoring machine for the Rebels. \nI also expect Karmichael Hunt to have his best season in the 15-man game. \nMaloney: Young Brumbies back-rower Rob Valetini. \nDoran: Isi Naisarani \nBrisbane City were poor last season, but this guy was a ray of sunshine. \nHe hasn’t made his Super Rugby debut yet, but the 22-year-old will be wearing Australian gold in next to no time. \nNaisarani’s workload is as big as his giant frame and he’s exactly the type of player the Wallabies need in the back-row. \nThe Force will be tenfold better for having him in their pack. \nMartin: He’s no rookie, but Sefa Naivalu is getting better and better. Super Rugby future in doubt 0:42 \n4) What stance should the ARU adopt regarding the Super Rugby format and their five franchises? \nHoiles: I’d like to see five teams stay, but we need more local derbies and we need our teams to not only be successful but playing entertaining and exciting rugby. \nEntertaining and exciting rugby can come in many ways — it’s not just about throwing the ball around at every opportunity. \nFans need to turn up and watch their team and leave feeling inspired by their performance, not only the result. \nI’m not yet convinced that having Japan and Argentina in the competition helps Super Rugby, and South Africa can’t support six teams. \nClark: Australian rugby must come first. \nI’m now leaning towards a model that increases trans-Tasman competition. \nA 5.30pm, 7.30pm double-header every Friday and Saturday night is the way to go. \nMcArdle: Firstly, I think everyone will acknowledge the current structure is unworkable and with the benefit of hindsight should never have been allowed to happen. \nI liked Wayne Smith’s suggestion in The Australian — a 10-team trans-Tasman competition. \nAt least we could keep five teams. \nMaloney : I don’t get paid enough to tell the ARU what stance they should adopt. \nI will say this, however — too much rugby is never enough for me, so five franchises suits me fine. \nDoran: Australian rugby should fight tooth and nail to keep their five franchises until the end of the broadcast rights deal in 2020 and then reassess. \nIt’s early signs but the Force appear to have turned a corner. \nIf they can get some results on the board, the crowds and momentum will start to build. \nSANZAAR, it would appear, are ready to take some action, but if the structure needs to change, it should start with getting rid of the sixth South African team. \nMartin: The competition needs to go back to 15 teams and everyone playing each other once, so humans can understand. \nIf that means we need to drop the Rebels or Force, that’s fine. \nDrop the team that comes last this year. 'He had such a presence' 0:59 \n5) Who will this year’s finalists be? \nHoiles: Crusaders, Lions, Reds, Hurricanes, Waratahs, Chiefs, Highlanders, Jaguares \nClark: Hurricanes, Highlanders, Crusaders, Waratahs, Reds, Stormers, Chiefs, Rebels \nMcArdle: The Reds will top the conference… and it’d be good to think another couple of Aussie teams could qualify. \nThe Tahs and the Rebels? \nMaybe the Brumbies and the Force? \nIf you need me I’ll be here on this fence. \nMaloney: I’ll go ahead and give you the grand finalists. \nReds v Crusaders. \nDoran: Lions v Highlanders in the big dance. \nReds, Bulls, Crusaders, Hurricanes, Waratahs and Jaguares to round out the eight. \nMartin: Hurricanes, Lions, Reds, Stormers, Highlanders, Crusaders, Waratahs, Jaguares \nLive stream 2017 Super Rugby on FOX SPORTS.
