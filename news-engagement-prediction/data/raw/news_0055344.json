UK and the European Union.\nIn an interview with Business Insider , David Wright, the former deputy director general for financial policy at the commission , said that the strident tone ahead of Britain’s divorce negotiations with the EU, and the “red lines” likely to dominate once Article 50 is triggered, could make an agreement between both parties impossible.\n\"Brexit was a dagger in my heart,\" Mr Wright, who spent more than 30 years working at the EU commission, told Business Insider .\nRead more Leaving EU customs union will mean border queues warn experts \"It's not a bit neutral, or a bit negative, but for the EU and the UK it's potentially extremely disruptive. There's a risk of a complete breakdown, certainly it's looking more probable,\" he added.\nThe Government said that it plans to trigger Article 50, the EU’s formal exit clause, by the end of next month. The House of Lords began debating the bill giving Prime Minister Theresa May the authority to take that step earlier this week.\n\"There's so much complexity. To resolve all of it in two years is absolutely impossible. Politics in the EU are not black and white like in the UK,\" Mr Wright said.\nRead more Four in 10 EU doctors in Britain 'considering leaving due to Brexit' Third of manufacturing firms 'want to move from UK after Brexit' British tourists face US-style online visa scheme in EU after Brexit Theresa May's Brexit plan 'not on offer', says Sir Ivan Rogers Hedge fund managers and financial services firm in the UK found themselves in an increasingly precarious position following Britain’s decision to leave the EU. Ms May’s hard Brexit will almost certainly result in the loss of crucial passporting rights, which allow financial firms to sell their services freely across the rest of the EU.\nMr Wright urged the UK government to provide more clarity on the future of financial services.\n\"The US isn't going to change its financial services laws for the UK, so the danger is [that] the UK is pulled towards US rulemaking approaches and away from EU parallelism,\" Mr Wright said.\n\"Some of the bills on the table could castrate the US regulators,” he said.\nMs May has sought to rid the UK of the obligation to offer free movement for EU citizens, by saying that Britain will leave the single market and instead negotiate access for some UK industrial sectors as part of a free trade agreement.\nBrexit Concerns 26 show all Brexit Concerns 1/26 Brexit will put British patients at 'back of the queue' for new drugs Brexit will put British patients at the “back of the queue” for vital new drugs, the Government has been warned – forcing them to wait up to two years longer\r \r A medicines regulator has raised the alarm over a likely decision to pull out of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), as well as the EU itself.\r ealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt dropped the bombshell , when he said he expected the UK would quit the EMA – because it is subject to rulings by the European Court of Justice.\nGetty Images\n2/26 London to lose status as 'gateway to Europe' for banks One of Germany’s top banking regulators has warned that London could lose its status as “gateway to Europe” for the banking sector after Britain quits the European trading bloc. \r \r Andreas Dombret, who is an executive board member for the Bundesbank—Germany’s central bank—told a private meeting of German businesses and banks earlier this week in Frankfurt that even if banking rules were “equivalent” between the UK and the rest of the EU, that was still “miles away from [Britain having] access to the single market”, the BBC reports. \nJason Hawkes\n3/26 Exodus The number of financial sector professionals in Britain and continental Europe looking for jobs in Ireland rocketed in the months after the UK voted to leave the European Union\nShutterstock\n4/26 Brexit is making FTSE 100 executives richer Pay packages of many FTSE 100 chief executive officers are partly tied to how well share prices are doing rather than the CEO’s performance -- and some stocks are soaring.\r ritish equities got a boost since the June vote because the likes of Rio Tinto, Smiths Group and WPP generate most sales abroad and earn a fortune when they convert these revenues back into the weakened pound.
