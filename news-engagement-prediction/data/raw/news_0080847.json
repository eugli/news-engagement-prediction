Its next verse, as captain and coach of a flagship Broncos club, gets its first ink against premiers Cronulla on Thursday. \nThis chapter almost came to an abrupt end almost six years ago, when Boyd had the world at his feet, but all he wanted was to go home. \nWith Bennett taking up a lucrative offer to join Newcastle at the start of 2011, Boyd spent the best part of six months weighing up whether to follow him to the Knights or stay at St. George Illawarra. \nOr take up a $1.5 million, three-year Titans deal that would sever ties with Bennett, the only NRL coach Boyd had ever known. \n“I’d been away for a long time and I really wanted to go home, back home where my grandma was,” Boyd told foxsports.com.au . \n“My friends and family, I was really missing them at that point and I was flying home almost every weekend. \n“I was lucky, at the time the Dragons were playing a lot of Friday night games so I used to fly back a lot of weekends. Boyd and Bennett during their 2010 title winning year with the Dragons. Source: News Limited \n“I was just homesick and sick of being away. I was really close. \n“I was seriously considering the Titans for a long time; I was ready to go a couple of times.” \nFor a then-24-year-old with off-field troubles starting to take serious hold, the lure of family loomed strong. \nA teenage Boyd had already once considered putting his crack at the NRL on hold until the Titans re-entered the competition in 2007. \nDelphine Boyd, the grandmother who raised him, was living on her own on the Gold Coast, and wasn’t getting any younger. \nGeorge Mimis — both Boyd and Bennett’s long-time seven-percenter — sat his client down with pen and paper to decide his future. \n“The pros of staying with Wayne were obvious: I was going to become a better football player and a better person hopefully as well,” Boyd says. \n“The only reason I really wanted to go home was to be home. But your career’s so short and you’re lucky if you can get 10, 12 or 15 years out of it. \n“So I thought you may as well do whatever you can to become a better footballer and person, and that meant sticking with Wayne and I think it’s worked out.” \nIt has worked out, with time. \nNRL-wide, Boyd is the best footballer in his position, one that features contenders Tedesco, Moylan, Slater, Trbojevic and Hayne. \nTo those that actually matter; friends, family, teammates and himself, Boyd is an infinitely better person. \nLewis willing to have a look Why Sharks can repeat 1:47 \nBoyd’s 2016 campaign was his best yet in over a decade in the game, and Luke Lewis’s own efforts last year stack up well against any of his 16 seasons of first grade. \nA premiership ring, Clive Churchill Medal capped 26 club appearances — his most ever in one season — for the 33-year-old, who, were it not for marked cards, would also still be in the frame for rep honours. \nLewis is having little of retirement talk as a result. If that means leaving Cronulla at the end of 2017 to secure another one-year deal, so be it. \n“At the moment I’m just going to listen to the body,” Lewis says. \n“I don’t want to string anyone along so I’m doing one year at a time. I feel great at training and fitness wise, so I don’t want to retire. \n“I totally understand that we do have a lot of young guys off contract — I think it’s 12 first graders or something — that would be priorities for the club to re-sign. \n“But if I have to go somewhere else to keep playing and I feel like I want to play on, I will. \n“I’m not going to string anyone along but. If there’s interest out there and I’d be going for the sake of going, then I won’t. But if I’m feeling good, I will.” \nA new stoush for the Storm 'Slater can get back to best' 1:11 \nCam Smith admitted to The Australian on Monday he’s “worried” about the latest raids on Melbourne’s prized forward pack. \nIt’s nothing all that new. Rival coaches have been eyeing off the fruits of Craig Bellamy’s considerable labours for at least a decade now. \nAlready Kevin Proctor has been lured home to the Gold Coast and fellow Kiwi rep Tohu Harris will make a similar move across the ditch in 2018. \nNewcastle and Wests Tigers are among those keen on Dale Finucane, the Cowboys want Jordan McLean, while the Bromwich brothers are also able to field formal offers. \nThe knock on recruiting out of rugby league’s deep south is that those players picked off have rarely performed as well once outside of Bellamy’s famed systems. \nThis crop of in-demand forwards though looms as the circuit breaker. \nProctor, Harris and Finucane and the Bromwich boys in particular shoulder far more responsibility in the Storm inner sanctum than their predecessors. \nIt’s the key to Bellamy’s succession planning around his ageing Holy Trinity of Slater, Cronk and Smith. \nIt also holds rivals in better stead if they do lure one of their key offsiders away from Melbourne. \nThey’ll be getting a player better equipped to handle life without three of the best the modern game has seen. \nLive stream the Sharks round one clash with the Broncos on FOX SPORTS.
