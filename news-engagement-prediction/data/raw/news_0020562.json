The reports soon spread on social media. 'It's time to focus on other things,' says Lesley Musina on Muvhango exit \nVusi told TshisaLIVE that he slowly became more concerned with the speculation as the rumours got vicious. \n\"I was okay with it in the beginning, people started asking questions and I would laugh it off. But it got a little more serious for me when I would read ridiculous things like I had gone to an island with my boyfriend and got married. That was when it really got to me,\" Vusi said. \nFrom that moment on, Vusi decided to change his stance and became more guarded with his love life. \n\"I started feeling like whatever I decide to do in my personal life has nothing to do with anyone else. I got to the point where I don't feel like I need to explain to people who I am dating or why I am dating that person. \nI am not going to entertain it and say I am gay or I am straight because I don't feel it has anything to do with anyone,\" Vusi said. \nHe said that he had accepted that his love life and sexuality would be the subject of speculation, and had become \"comfortable\" with people guessing. Siv Ngesi defends Joost van der Westhuizen's memory against negativity \nVusi did however reveal that he was still recovering from a break-up late last year. \n\"I broke up with someone around September last year when my last album came out and I have been single ever since. Some of my recent songs were inspired by the break-up. I am open to finding love. I still believe in love. I honestly believe my person is still out there,\" Vusi said.
