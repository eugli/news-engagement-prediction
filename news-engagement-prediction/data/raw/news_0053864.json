No women’s strike has been called for March 8 in China, but the word “strike” is politically delicate in China. The government discourages, and sometimes harshly represses, any mass activities outside state control, including at the government-run All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the All-China Women’s Federation . The move may also reflect a tightening of security two weeks before China’s annual parliamentary meetings, which begin March 5, during which the government traditionally cracks down on the already limited political debate in the country’s censored media. Also, the Communist Party will hold its 19th Central Committee meeting later this year, where major leadership decisions are expected. According to a message circulating on social media that quoted an unidentified person working at Sina.com , women’s rights advocates said the account’s suspension had come from the Cyberspace Administration of the State Internet Information Office , which can “direct, coordinate and supervise online content management,” according to the state news media. For now, Feminist Voices’ Weibo communications have been transferred to another Weibo account, “ Fairness for Women .’’ The action against Feminist Voices shortly before International Women’s Day mirrors events in 2015, when five Chinese feminists were detained on the eve of March 8 for planning to distribute leaflets warning of sexual harassment on public transit. Those women spent several weeks in detention before being released on bail conditions that were not lifted until more than a year later. At the time, the police said they were still investigating accusations that the five women had been “gathering a crowd to disturb public order,” a criminal charge, said Chen Jinxue, a lawyer for one of the women. The Chinese government says it is striving to achieve equality for women, as laid out in the country’s Constitution, and that it has made substantial progress in recent years. In New York in 2015, President Xi Jinping affirmed the government’s commitment to women’s rights. \nFollow Didi Kirsten Tatlow on Twitter at @dktatlow . \nKaroline Kan contributed research. \nGet news and analysis from Asia and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: Asian Morning newsletter.
