In August last year, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice President and Prime Minister of UAE and Ruler of Dubai paid a rich tribute, honouring Emirati women and their ever-growing roles. \" We do not only empower women, but we empower the whole community through women. Our state will remain stronger, thanks to your diligence and perseverance.\" Diligence and perseverance are just some of the qualities that women in the police force hold strongly, a top official at Dubai Police told Khaleej Times , on the sidelines of the ongoing International Defence Exhibition (Idex) in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. Captain Eng. Humaid Sultan Bin Dalmouk, head of Technical Support - Explosives Security Department, Dubai Police, noted that female police officers are even \"becoming better than their male colleagues,\" when it comes to executing various tasks that require flexibility and multi-tasking.\" \"Today, Emirati women are playing a tremendous role when it comes to the security and safety of communities,\" he added. \"The women in our department play a critical role, especially when it comes to protecting female VIP guests and officials from foreign countries.\" He pointed out that in his department there are 40 policewomen, in which 16 have the duty of protecting VIPs at all times, and are even capable of riding motorbikes. Captain Eng. Dalmouk noted that Sheikh Mohammed often encourages Emirati women to join powerful, striking roles, adding that: \"More women are now seeking to join the police force and we welcome them.\" \"Women play a very prominent role when it comes to executing our operations,\" he said, adding that \"They are perfect.\" The number grows Major Abdulbasit Ali Abdulrahman, Dubai Police, said that one should not find it too surprising to witness the growing numbers of policewomen in the UAE. \"Becoming a police officer means you must work alongside the community and help serve people.\" \"Women have a natural gift when it comes to helping others, which is why it is no surprise to see why so many women join this industry.\" Colonel Dr Ahmed Mohammed Rashed Alsaadi, Dubai Police, said he is certainly proud to see the growing rate of policewomen, adding that the way UAE's leaders help encourage people has in itself become a cycle that encourages women. \"When we see how the government helps the people, we try to do the same and therefore we like to encourage women to join us help serve the communities, because helping people is in our blood.\" 'There's no such thing as fear' First Sergeant Azza Abdullah Al Sehhi, Dubai Police, shared her incredible experience about what it is like being a policewoman in the UAE. The 28-year-old, who has been with Dubai Police for four years, highlighted on the notion that her dream of joining the police force began from a young age. \"I wanted to be a policewoman ever since I was a child, because both my parents and brother are police officers.\" \"I loved the idea of following my parent's footsteps and becoming a policewoman myself one day, and I am happy to say that I followed my dream and made it my reality.\" First Sergeant Al Sehhi pointed out that she is proud to see so many Emirati women serving their communities. \"As soon as a woman joins the police force, she will immediately feel challenged, yet inspired.\" \"A policewoman will certainly encounter various challenges and physical activities, whether it is riding a motorbike regularly, a horse, or protecting foreign VIP guests with her life - there are endless possibilities in this industry.\" She noted that protecting international VIPs can be dangerous, yet exhilarating at the same time. \"I hope my children in the future will follow my footsteps and become police officers.\" Jamila Rashid Al Hammadi, Dubai Police, also shared why she chose to take on a role that may sometimes be perceived as \"the outside of the norm for a woman.\" She highlighted that it was her experience working in an office behind a desk, which eventually led her to make a life-changing decision. \"I did not want to sit and work in an office for the rest of my life, I wanted something challenging, where I can test my strengths and weaknesses, where I can test my mind and body - so I joined the police force.\" \"Today, I love being a policewoman more than I could image,\" added the 32-year-old, who has been working for Dubai Police for four years. \"Many people ask me: 'How could you as a woman drive a motorbike?'\" She laughed. \"I tell them there is no such thing as fear.\" jasmine@khaleejtimes.com ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:14:09.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
