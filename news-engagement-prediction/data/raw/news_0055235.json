The event also has dropped \"Belle Isle\" from its official name and has a new logo. \nNew logo for the Chevrolet Detroit Grand Prix, presented by Lear (Photo: Courtesy of the Detroit Grand Prix) \n“It’s just huge for us,” Denker said. “Lear and (CEO) Matt Simoncini are great supporters of Detroit and our community. For us to have Lear on board, because of their Detroit ties, their giving nature – they give so much to the city already. They have a new Innovation Center down in Capital Park. It just makes so much sense, and we’re excited to have them aboard.” \nThe 2017 Grand Prix weekend has seven races scheduled on the 2.3-mile street circuit on Belle Isle on June 2-4. The event is highlighted by the Chevy Dual in Detroit, the only doubleheader on the Verizon IndyCar Series schedule. \nThe race previously was named the Chevrolet Detroit Belle Isle Grand Prix. Quicken Loans, which still will be involved in the event, had been the presenting sponsor. \nRather than have multiple logos for each race, there now will be one logo for the event. It highlights the Scott Fountain, the signature landmark of Belle Isle Park, and the silhouette of the downtown GM Renaissance Center, General Motors’ world headquarters. The new logo also recognizes the event’s two primary partners: Chevrolet as the title sponsor and Lear Corporation as the presenting sponsor. \nTerms of the deal with Lear were not announced today. \nDenker said Lear had a chalet to entertain customers and guests during past Grand Prix weekends. Now its branding will be on all race signage and tickets. \n“They will have a lot more people there, a lot more product that they can show customers,” Denker said. “A global brand, global partner, global supplier, now stepping up to assist Roger Penske, myself and Chevrolet, is a real big deal.” \nLear Corporation is celebrating its 100th anniversary this year, after being founded in Detroit in 1917 as American Metal Products. It is a global supplier of automotive seating and electrical systems and is headquartered in Southfield. The corporation has approximately 150,000 employees in 37 countries. Lear opened its Innovation Center in Detroit in the fall. \n“Lear is proud to partner with Chevrolet to bring the Grand Prix to the Motor City. Belle Isle Park is a perfect setting for an event like the Grand Prix,” Simoncini, president and CEO of Lear Corporation, said in a released statement. “We are looking forward to welcoming thousands of race fans to Detroit and showcasing our city to a national television audience of millions. Detroit is America’s comeback city and a great place to live, work and innovate.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:08:02.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
