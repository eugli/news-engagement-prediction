February 22, 2017 10:05 PM by John Powers Jeffrey Mayer I can’t tell you exactly when it happened—it was sometime between the Golden Globes and the SAG Awards —but there came a moment when I started feeling like a marathoner who, grasping for the water bottle, realizes there are still six more miles to go. My soul was crying out: “Enough!” I didn’t want to hear any more about La La Land and its Oscar chances . I didn’t want to read any more interviews with its director, Damien Chazelle . I didn’t want to see Emma Stone gallantly struggle through another inane red carpet interview when every fiber of her being was shrieking, “just let me go home.” I particularly didn’t want to see another pro-and-con discussion of Chazelle’s movie in The New York Times by reporters who don’t even write about movies. Don’t these folks have anything better to do—you know, like covering the gutting of the Endangered Species Act ? What makes this so funny is that I really like La La Land (though I wouldn’t mind shaking the “City of Stars” earworm) and think it has the finest ending sequence of any movie in years. I really like Chazelle, both as a filmmaker and a person. As for Stone, I did her first interview with Vogue and adored her— I knew she’d be a star. Heck, I even think La La Land should win the Best Picture Oscar, though not because it’s actually the best picture. In the first place, there’s no such thing, and anyway, Oscars usually go to movies that clearly are not the best —remember Argo, The Artist, Crash, etc.? La La Land should win best picture because it’s the good movie that best captures the moment. Ten years from now, people will remember going to see its happy colors and high spirits against the backdrop of Donald Trump becoming president . So, my problem isn’t with La La Land . It’s with our American habit—radically intensified by the digital age—of overdoing everything until it becomes slightly monstrous. Beloved shows like Mad Men, Breaking Bad, or Game of Thrones can’t just end . They have to end over two years, in split seasons, surrounded by a drumbeat of publicity and media palaver fanning our expectations. Our presidential contests last two full years and—because people prefer the poetry of campaigning to the prose of governing—they completely overshadow what the real president is doing in the world . The same thing has happened with the Academy Awards. What once was an enjoyably frivolous event that brightened the winter— Hollywood stars dressed to the nines and hoping to win a prize—has become a juggernaut in the entertainment industrial complex. Being an Oscars pundit is now an actual job! These days, awards season runs six months, at the very least: In Sundance this January, there was already Oscar talk about movies that couldn’t possibly win one until February of 2018. In fact, there are so many articles, so many Q&As, so many ads, so many predictions, that by the time the show comes around, everyone is so exhausted that the whole thing feels like a letdown. Even now, we can all imagine the reviews of this Sunday’s Oscar-cast, saying how entirely dull the evening was. Now, awards fatigue is hardly a disaster in real world terms, even though it may be slightly disastrous how much more attention America gives to the Oscars than, say, what’s going on in Syria . That said, at the risk of seeming like a scold, it’s worth pointing out the downside of our current awards fixation . For starters, the concentration on the handful of contenders sucks up all the air in the cinematic room, suffocating all the films that—often for reasons of bad marketing—don’t make it into the awards mix. Movies like Silence, Patterson, I, Daniel Blake (which merely won Cannes ), Neruda, The Handmaiden , and Julieta are all pre-eminently worth seeing, yet they’ve gotten lost in the mountain of attention lavished on La La Land , Moonlight , Hidden Figures , and Manchester by the Sea . Because of the Oscars, the whole culture winds up obsessively focusing on the same few films. Yet the obsession isn’t with the movies themselves. Who cares about what they are saying, how well they’re made, or what they might mean out in the world? What percentage of *La La Land’*s fans will bother to check out its inspiration, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg ? Who among *Moonlight’*s admirers will have come across a single article pointing out that that its three-part structure was influenced by Three Times, a film by the Taiwanese genius Hou Hsiao-hsien? What matters is their place in the Oscars horse race. The coverage becomes all about personalities, behind-the-scene stories, whose gown is gorgeous, whose peccadilloes may cost them, and above all, who’s favored to win. In a sense this isn’t surprising: You see, even as movie awards loom ever larger, movies themselves— especially the kind of movies that get nominated—play an ever-smaller role in our lives. (The nine Best Picture nominees combined have pulled in $625 million; Rogue One alone made $525 million.) By way of compensation for film’s dwindling cultural importance, we now measure a movie’s importance by its box-office receipts and its prizes—as if anybody’s life was affected even slightly by Captain America: Civil War or The Artist . Which is another way of saying that our awards mania is less about worth than it is about winning. In this, it’s reminiscent of our political coverage, which just spent two full years covering a presidential election without ever digging into the issues. It was too busy caring about the horse-race. And then people were surprised that Donald Trump kept talking about his poll numbers, as if media types like Chuck Todd or Chris Wallace or Jake Tapper spent their days telling us about alternatives to Obamacare —they were hooked on those numbers, too. In truth, Trump’s fixation on being a \"winner\" fits perfectly into a culture that spends half of each year obsessing over which movie is going to win a statuette. Could you pass me a bottle of water for the last 200 yards?
