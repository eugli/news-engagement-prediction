Rookies lead charge as Kelowna Rockets blank Vancouver Giants \n“No matter where our team is in the standings and how they’re playing come in, [you] still have to put the work in and put the compete in to give yourself the opportunity to win the game,” he said. \nThe Rockets scored three times in the opening period, once in the second and six more times in the third. \nRodney Southam had a hat trick, while Kole Lind chalked up his 27th goal of the season. \nThe Oil Kings scored their lone goal at 9:34 of the third. \nKelowna netminder Brodan Salmond improved his record to 10-7-2-0 on the season, stopping 14 of Edmonton’s 15 shots on goal. \nThe Rockets record improves to 35-20-5-0 on the season. \nKelowna face the Blazers in Kamloops on Friday, head to Seattle Saturday to take on the Thunderbirds, and play their third game in three nights in Spokane on Sunday. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:31:53.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
