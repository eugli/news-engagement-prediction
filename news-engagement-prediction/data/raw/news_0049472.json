Rick Ankiel (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 6:25 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 6:25 p.m. ET \nRick Ankiel is known for his epic pitching slump with the Cardinals, then his resurgence into the big leagues after a rough few years. \nHowever, what wasn't known was that Ankiel used liquid courage in the form of vodka to push him through a couple of games early is his career. \nMORE: Every MLB team's worst postseason memory, revisited \nAnkiel joined host Ryan Kelley on \" The Morning After \" during Cardinals spring training Monday to discuss his new autobiography coming out in April and dropped a few details on how he dealt with nerves when he was a surprise opening day starter in 2001 against the Diamondbacks and pitcher Randy Johnson. \n“Before that game … I’m scared to death. I know I have no chance. Feeling the pressure of all that, right before the game I get a bottle of vodka. I just started drinking vodka. Low and behold, it kind of tamed the monster, and I was able to do what I wanted,\" Ankiel said. \n\"I’m sitting on the bench feeling crazy I have to drink vodka to pitch through this. It worked for that game. (I had never drank before a game before). It was one of those things like the yips, the monster, the disease … it didn’t fight fair so I felt like I wasn’t going to fight fair either.” \nAnkiel said he also drank during his second start that season, a loss to the Astros, but realized after that alcohol could not be a solution to his nerves. \nIt all followed a disastrous 2000 postseason for Ankiel and served as the beginning of the end of his pitching career. He last threw a big league pitch in 2004. \nAnkiel then took a couple of seasons off to recover from various injuries and to reinvent himself as a position player. He worked his way back up to the major leagues from rookie ball as an outfielder and had his best season as a hitter in 2008, batting .264/.337/.506 with 25 home runs and 71 RBIs. \nHe retired before the start of the 2014 season.
