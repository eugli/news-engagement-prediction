I haven’t put that out. That is wrong.” \nUkip press officer Lynda Roughley later issued a statement saying she was “entirely responsible” and offered to resign. \nShe said: “Paul is a man of great integrity and would not say something he knew to be untrue. It’s me who has made this mistake, and one I feel absolutely terrible about. \n“I am frankly mortified at the distress this issue has caused Paul and may have caused to anyone involved with the Hillsborough tragedy. \n“I have today offered my resignation. I could not be more sorry.” Related...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T15:56:05.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
