But he’s also the co-sponsor on a proposal that would require school employees — and even some students — to report assaults or else face criminal penalties. \n“We’ve got to be serious about this,” Watson said. “Students have a right to be safe.” 52 acts of rape \nBattling sexual assault on college campuses is now a top priority for both Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate. The players might disagree on exactly what to do and how to do it, but leaders on both sides of the aisle agree this is the year to act. \nThe Baylor scandal began back in 2015 and last year claimed the careers of several top staff members, coaches and even then-President Ken Starr. A report the university commissioned showed “institutional failure at every level.” By year’s end, more than a dozen women had sued the school, saying they were bullied and shamed into keeping their mouths shut about the trauma endured. \nThen, in January, a new bombshell : A lawsuit claimed 31 Baylor football players committed at least 52 acts of rape in just three years, a number that blew away previous estimates and allegations. Baylor sex assault scandal: Everything you need to know to understand what happened \nBut while the situation at Baylor has forced lawmakers to seriously consider more stringent changes, they said every school should be under the state’s microscope. In 2015, Texas passed a law that for the first time required colleges and universities to draw up sexual assault prevention plans and educate students about them. \n“It wasn’t a big enough step,” Watson said. “While Baylor has highlighted this issue and caused a focus, this isn’t just about Baylor. We need a new culture in higher education.” 'All of the above' \nWatson’s five bills have one unifying goal: encourage more students to report harassment, stalking, rape and other acts of sexual violence by lessening the stigmas and potential negative repercussions for doing so. \nHe wants to require every school to establish anonymous online reporting tools for sexual assault victims and witnesses and make sure students aren’t punished for underage drinking or breaking a school’s conduct rules if they’re reporting an assault, the threat of which many Baylor students said held them back from coming forth with their allegations. \nHe also wants Texas to join California, New York and the handful of other states that have passed “affirmative consent” laws requiring colleges to tell students they must get a verbal “yes” from their sexual partner before initiating any sexual contact. \nWatson is also co-sponsoring a bill with Sen. Joan Huffman, a Houston Republican and former judge, that would put in place some of the most stringent anti-campus rape rules in the country. \nSenate Bill 576 would require any school employee, and some student leaders, to report any instance of “sexual harassment, sexual assault, family violence or stalking” within 48 hours of becoming aware of the incident, or else face serious consequences. \nPeople who fail to report could be charged with a Class A misdemeanor — punishable by up to $4,000 in fines and a year in jail — if they were found to have intentionally concealed information about an assault. Then bill would also require schools to gather data on reports of sexual violence and disseminate this information twice a year. \nHuffman did not respond to requests for comment about her bill. Watson, while a co-sponsor, said he was not involved in the drafting of the legislation. \nRep. J.M. Lozano, the new chair of the House Committee on Higher Education, favors an “all of the above” approach, he said. Reporting has to improve, there needs to be more funding of mental health services for student survivors and, yes, there may need to be “a deterrent to conspiracies,\" he said. \n“I would support that,” he said of the bill’s provision to punish people, including some students, who try to conceal assault reporting. “If there’s a conspiracy to intentionally withhold that information, if there’s a conspiracy of sorts, I would definitely penalize a peer.” \nLozano also said school admissions officers should have access to an applicant’s full criminal history, including expunged juvenile records. 'A chilling atmosphere' \nNot everyone agrees with this aggressive approach. Rep. Terry Canales, an Edinburg Democrat who wants schools to have better outreach programs to combat sexual violence, questioned whether threatening to punish students and staff would improve the problem. \n“At first blush, it doesn’t seem constitutional,” Canales said Monday. “We want people to report without making criminals out of them.” \nFederal laws like the Clery Act and Title IX already require schools to report on annual crime statistics and protect the rights of assault victims. But they don't apply criminal penalties to discourage the failure to report. \nSen.

(AP Photo/Austin American-Statesman, Laura Skelding) AP \nPatricia Davis, a Title IX attorney in Dallas, said Huffman’s bill may go too far. \n“It will create a chilling atmosphere on campus for everyone,” Davis said of the criminal penalties. \nShe favors Watson’s so-called amnesty bills, on the other hand, and said all these proposals together, if passed into law, would place Texas into a group with some of the most aggressive states fighting campus sexual assault. \n“The amnesty bill would actually put us ahead of a lot of states,” Davis said, adding that “the reporting, the criminal possibilities for not reporting, would make us much stricter.” View Comments ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:11:40.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
