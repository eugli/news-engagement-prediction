Media caption Two cars fell into sinkhole in Los Angeles during the storm \nMeteorologists described the storm as \"bombogenesis\", an intense extra-tropical cyclonic low-pressure area, or \"a weather bomb\". Image copyright AP Image caption A fire engine being recovered close to Los Angeles after part of a freeway collapsed from the heavy rain \nOne man was killed after a tree fell and pulled a power line on to his car in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles. \nA second person died in a vehicle when it was submerged by a flash flood in the town of Victorville. \nTwo others died in car accidents in the San Diego area, and another person was found dead after being swept into a creek in Ventura County. \nEvacuation orders were lifted in the towns of Duarte on Saturday afternoon (local time). \nThe north of the state has already experienced fears of flooding at the tallest dam in the country , Oroville Dam, when more than 180,000 residents were evacuated from their homes last week. \nAuthorities at the dam have been working to lower the level of the lake and have said it has continued to fall despite the storm. \nAre you in the affected regions?
