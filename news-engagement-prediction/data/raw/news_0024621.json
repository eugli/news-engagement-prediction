Evan Mory , the cityâ€™s director of traffic and parking management, filed an appropriation request for $200,000 to begin the process. The request affects 3rd and 4th Street and 8th and 9th Street through downtown St. Pete. The request is for $200,000 to pay for a consultant to develop a plan addressing how to adapt infrastructure including changing traffic signals and interstate on-ramps. Converting single direction thoroughfares in urban areas into two-way roads is part of a complete street strategy taking hold nationally that encourages pedestrian and bicycle use as well as stimulating the local economy by increasing access to businesses. A request filed by the city and sponsored by first term State Rep. Ben Diamond (D-St. Petersburg) lists the targeted project as one that improves citizen health outcomes, promotes a healthy environment and fosters economic growth. Two-way streets along the four roads would include pedestrian and bike paths, which the city argues creates a more active population and reduces vehicle miles driven. The two-way streets also provide a better transition to nearby areas like the Edge District and Grand Central by eliminating the need to pass destinations and circle back which is currently necessary under the grid of mostly one-way roads. One-way roads are considered better for getting drivers across longer distances while two-way streets are better for short trips. To become effective, the request needs to be included in Florida's 2017 budget and then is subject to the governor's review. Janelle Irwin is a reporter for the Tampa Bay Business Journal.
