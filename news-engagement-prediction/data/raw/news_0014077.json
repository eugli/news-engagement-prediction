Kabinveerapan knew he wanted to be a police officer and he expects his law degree will stand him in good stead. \nArmed with a law degree from University of Northumbria in Newcastle, Britain, the 22-year-old from Selangor joined the police force last year. \nYesterday, Kabinveerapan was the youngest of 596 cadet inspectors who graduated as probationary inspectors after nine months of intense training. \n“Joining the police force has definitely been my ambition as I was inspired by many notable figures. \n“I am confident that a police officer with a knowledge of the law would play a more effective role. \n“That’s the main reason I studied law to serve the public and country,” he said during the graduation ceremony at the Police Training Centre (Pulapol) here.
