We're going to respect the negotiating process.\"\nNotley's government is weighed down by a large budget deficit and is facing the expiry of several key contracts with nurses, the Health Sciences Association and the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees. Teachers are already in contract talks.\nLast spring, the Alberta government passed a law to comply with a Supreme Court ruling that public sector workers have the right to strike. The Progressive Conservatives barred AUPE from legal walkouts when the union formed in the 1970s.\n\"So … it is a new world. That being said, we put in essential services levels. Even if job action occurs, it would happen on the outskirts of what is deemed essential,\" Notley said.\nMORE ALBERTA NEWS | WestJet plane turns back after smoke in cockpit 2nd day in a row MORE ALBERTA NEWS | 'Completely destroyed' but singing 'a worship song': Bobsled-track crash survivors stand strong in faith With files from Andrew Brown © The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-03T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:34:01.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
