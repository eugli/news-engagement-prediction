I love Ronda. I’ve always supported Ronda, and then when she loses that second one, people are trying to make me celebrate like, ‘Now they’ve got nobody.’ 'WEAK INDIVIDUALS' \n“That’s the wrong mindset. I don’t celebrate another person’s defeat like that. That’s weak. That’s a weak individual that does that. \n“There’s people that tried to celebrate when I lost that got nothing to do with it. \n\"That’s not the sign of the champion – that’s not the sign of a true champion. I couldn’t believe it. We’re all in it on our own, but what someone else does or doesn’t do has no effect on me and what I do. \n“I’m doing what I do, she’s doing what she’s doing, everyone else is doing what they’re doing and it is what it is.” \nMcGregor also had his say on Rousey getting a free pass from her media duties, something that saw the Notorious pulled from the UFC 200 card when he wanted the same. \nHe added: “I didn’t give a f**k! I’m the two-weight world champion at that stage. I’m f g richer than rich. I don’t give a bollocks, she didn’t have to do the media and that’s great.” \nMcGregor has always been supportive of Rousey, and it’s great to see someone with influence come to her defence. \nWhat do you make of Conor McGregor’s comments on Ronda Rousey?
