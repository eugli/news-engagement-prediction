He's covered just about everything and that's the way he likes it. He lives in South Jersey with his three kids and a dog, and likes to sleep in tents as much as possible. More by Jason Nark \nPhiladelphia’s court rooms are taking a cue from Dave Chappelle, Guns n’ Roses, and Childish Gambino by implementing new technology to restrict an ubiquitous one. \nThe goal: reducing witness tampering by restricting the use of cellphones in court. \nStarting April 3, visitors to the Juanita Kidd Stout Center for Criminal Justice on Filbert Street will be required to turn off their cellphones and place them in a portable “pouch” that will remain locked until they leave the building. The First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, in a news release issued Thursday, said the new rule aims “to deter, if not eliminate, intimidation of witnesses and courtroom disruptions.” \n“The proliferation of mobile devices throughout society has given rise to safety and security concerns in our courtrooms,” wrote Judge Jacqueline F. Allen of the Court of Common Pleas. \nThe pouch, created by the San Francisco-based Yondr, has mostly been used by musicians and comedians, according to media reports posted on the company’s web site. It’s unclear whether the pouches have ever been used by a municipality before and representatives from Yondr did not immediately return requests for comment. \nVisitors to the courthouse will keep their cell phones locked in the Yondr pouch. After court, the pouch will be unlocked by a magnetic disk. The distribution and collection of the pouches will be handled by the Sheriff’s office. \nNumerous groups will be exempt from the ban, including jurors, attorneys, employees, police officers, people with disabilities, case workers and members of the media. \nAny effort to reduce witness intimidation and improve courtroom security in the CJC is something the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office supports,\" said Cameron L. Kline, spokesman for DA Seth Williams. \nLorraine Donnelly worked as an assistant district attorney for 10 years and said witness intimidation with cellphone is “1,000 percent a problem.” She recalled a preliminary hearing for a murder where a member of the audience snapped a photo of a witness and posted it on an Instagram page about “snitches.” \n“I don’t know if this pouch thing is going to work but controlling the cell phone for people in the audience is a good idea,” Donnelly, who is now with the firm Wilkes & McHugh. \nVeteran criminal defense attorney Jack McMahon said he thinks the cell phone plane will make a chaotic venue even worse, the lines longer. \n‘Who knows, some days it feels like a comedy show down there,” McMahon said. “When you make a step like that, there has to be a significant problem. In my dealings, it’s not been a real issue.” \nMcMahon said it’s important for him to have contact with witnesses, defendants and their family members while in the courthouse. \n“It will create a logistical nightmare and a problem between counsel and their family,” McMahon said. \nCourt of Common Pleas President Judge Sheila Woods-Skipper, in the news release, said the program “has received broad support from our justice partners.” \n“While we realize there may be some concerns about the new restrictions, we believe we have found a realistic way to increase safety in our courthouse without placing too much of a burden on the people we serve,\" she said. \nThe news release did not mention the cost of the pouch program or how many it would be using and a spokesman did not immediately return a request for those numbers. An October article on Yondr in the New York Times said the company rents the pouches for $2 a day but offers discounts for “large quantities” and schools. \nYondr’s founder, Graham Dugoni, had a philosophical bent about his company’s purpose. \n“I view it as a social movement, and this is one piece of the puzzle,” Dugoni told the New York Times. “It’s about helping people live in the digital age in a way that doesn’t hollow out all of the meaning in your life.” Published: February 23, 2017 — 12:40 PM EST | Updated: February 23, 2017 — 1:30 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.
