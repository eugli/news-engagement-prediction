Frazier was dazzling in the loss 16m ago • 1 min read \nThere’s no way John Calipari could’ve predicted this kind of win -- at any point in the season -- for his team. \nKentucky managed to escape Georgia with an 82-77 victory on Saturday night. The win’s big for UK because it keeps the SEC regular-season title in sight, and it means UK (22-5, 12-2) is riding a four-game winning streak with two of those dubs having come on the road. \nBut Saturday was weird. First off, Georgia lost Yante Maten less than two minutes into the game, due to a knee injury. Maten’s been a top-30 player in college hoops this season. How could Georgia possibly win this game without him? \nEnter J.J. Frazier. The senior Bulldogs point guard was tremendous, putting up one of the strongest performances anyone will have against UK this season. Frazier, all 5 feet and 10 inches of him, was incredible from start to finish, closing with 36 points, one shy of his career best. \nBut Kentucky still wins. How? Made foul shots, of all things. UK entered the day ranked 211th in the country in free throw percentage. Yet the Wildcats closed this game out because of 17 straight made free throws, went 18-of-23 from the line, and De’Aaron Fox was the catalyst. \nFox (16 points, five rebounds, five assists, three steals) scored nine straight in the closing stretch for UK, helping give the Wildcats the lead and then some point insurance. What’s so important for UK: Fox had a bad day, mostly, then was ultra reliable in the final three minutes. To have a lightning-quick point guard be that good at the foul line, to get to the rim and force the other team to commit fouls, it’s massive, particularly when he proves he can do it in crunch time in a game where he’d been off most of the night. Close wins are currency for coaches at this point in the season. They know winning small, on the road, has true impact on team morale and confidence. \nUGA’s now 0-6 vs. Top 25 team this season. Their last whimper of a hope to become a bubble team died with this loss. It’s NIT or bust for the Dawgs at this point, barring winning the SEC tournament.
