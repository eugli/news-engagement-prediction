The simplistic idea of saying, 'Oh, everyone deserves equal rights and equal protections' ... I don't even know. I just wish this wasn't a reality.\" \nGrace said this is clear proof that, despite whatever pledges to support the LGBTQ community Trump made during his campaign, this move is unsurprising and proof that \"this is an administration that doesn't fucking care about transgender people.\" \nEven worse, Grace said, this action to take away protection is \"somehow more evil\" than previous administrations before the Obama administration that have just ignored transgender people. \n\"And it's not just this action by the administration toward transgender people that's scary. It's the overall agenda of making certain groups of people seem less than other groups of people and how that contributes to discrimination and allows people to treat other people as subhuman,\" she said. \"You are stating, 'These people are not equal to these other people. They don't deserve protection.' And it's just fucked up.\" \nAs for what comes next, Grace said it's a \"continual battle for education\" about gender identity and what it means to be trans. \n\"So many people are ignorant around the bathroom issue in particular,\" she said. \"It's insane that it's something that's so heated or so misunderstood. It's insane that it's a reality for transgender people, that it's my reality. Most of the time, I will just wait to use the fucking bathroom, and not do it in public. I feel so strongly about it being an issue for students because I remember there always being traumatic issues around restrooms in elementary school when I was growing up, and this is not even being out as a transgender person but just the experience of being a student and using a locker room or a bathroom and already feeling unprotected. You're creating that much more dangerous of an environment for transgender students.\" \nRead the full interview here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:00:18.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
