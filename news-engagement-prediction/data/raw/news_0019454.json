The undocumented migrant from Mexico, Guadalupe García de Rayos, was detained after she was called to the regional Immigration and Customs Enforcement Center for her regular check-in. Instead of being released as she has normally been in the past, the mother of two was taken into custody and issued an order of deportation. (Reuters) About eight years ago, there was a knock on Guadalupe García de Rayos’s door. Authorities had come to arrest the undocumented mother of two U.S.-born children, a Mexican native who had lived north of the border since she was 14.\nThe Phoenix mother was detained for months and eventually ordered to be sent back to Mexico. But for the subsequent years, after she appealed her voluntary deportation, García de Rayos was allowed to remain in the United States, as long as she checked in once a year, and then every six months. Each year, she followed suit, and each year, immigration officials let her stay.\nThis year, as García de Rayos feared, was different. When she went to check in as usual at the central Phoenix offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, she was taken into custody as protests erupted outside. García de Rayos could perhaps be among the first undocumented immigrants to be arrested during a scheduled meeting with immigration officials since President Trump’s inauguration, civil rights lawyers told the New York Times. \n[ VIDEO: Young, undocumented and worried about her future ] \nHaving anticipated the mother’s possible detention, the group Puente Arizona had organized a rally outside the offices, and crowds swelled to about 200 people at the peak of the gathering, the Arizona Republic reported . Protesters, including de Rayos’ two children, shouted, “No papers, no fear” and “Let her go, set her free,” as others banged on drums and raised posters and flags.\nFor several hours, demonstrators blocked an ICE van with García de Rayos inside — one man even tied himself to one of the van’s front wheels. It was unclear whether the van was taking García de Rayos and other deportees to Mexico or to detention. Seven protesters were arrested, but the majority of the demonstration was peaceful, Phoenix police tweeted.\nBesides the few people engaged in criminal acts, most people out here are peaceful and exercising their rights properly.\n— Phoenix Police (@phoenixpolice) February 9, 2017 \n\nGarcía de Rayos’s detention is likely to mark a shift in deportation priorities under Trump. Previously, the Obama administration prioritized the deportation of people who were violent offenders or had ties to criminal gangs. Trump’s executive order on Jan. 25 expanded priorities to include any undocumented immigrants who had been convicted of a criminal offense.\n[ The long struggle over what to call ‘undocumented immigrants’ or, as Trump said in his order, ‘illegal aliens’ ] \nIn a statement, ICE officials said García de Rayos was detained based on a removal order issued by the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which became final in May 2013, and was spurred by a prior felony conviction dating from March 2009 for criminal impersonation.\nThe conviction stems from one of former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio’s worksite raids targeting the Golfland Entertainment Centers, which operated several water and mini-golf parks. Sheriff’s deputies seized hundreds of employment records and later arrested García de Rayos at her house, the Arizona Republic reported. She pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal impersonation, a Class 6 felony, the lowest level.\nAfter being arrested and turned over to ICE, García de Rayos spent six months at the Eloy Detention Center. She is now fighting to have her felony conviction thrown out on grounds that Arpaio’s worksite raids were unconstitutional. Puente Arizona filed a lawsuit in 2015 to end Arpaio’s raids, an often-touted law-enforcement tactic that has led to the arrests of hundreds of immigrant workers since 2008.\n“It has 100 percent to do with the executive order,” said Ray Ybarra-Maldonado, a Phoenix immigration lawyer who is representing García de Rayos, told the Arizona Republic.\n\nA protester locked himself to the van carrying Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos that is stopped by protesters outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. (Rob Schumacher/Arizona Republic via Associated Press) Ybarra-Maldonado immediately filed documents asking ICE to stay her deportation, on the basis that she has lived in the United States since she was 14, has two children who are U.S. citizens and is fighting to have her felony conviction overturned, he told reporters. \nThe protesters said that they initially stopped the vehicles from leaving, but that they later left the grounds by another exit, the Associated Press reported. They didn’t know if García de Rayos was still in the vehicle.\nCarlos García, the director of Puente, told the Arizona Republic that he thinks ICE’s decision to take García de Rayos into custody will spur other undocumented immigrants who have been released on supervision to stop checking in and go into hiding.\n“Most definitely, if what’s going to happen when people come to check in they are going to get detained and deported, I would assume most people will not turn themselves in,” he said.\nWhen asked what she would tell Trump if she had the chance, García de Rayos’ daughter Jaqueline, 14, told reporters , “I’d ask him why he would want to take her from me. She hasn’t done anything wrong and I’m not scared of him.”\nAsked how long she planned to stay, Jaqueline had a simple answer, the Arizona Republic reported: “Until I get my mom back.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T17:51:52.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
