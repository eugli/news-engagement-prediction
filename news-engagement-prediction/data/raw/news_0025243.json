Dr Ellis said he had spoken to her about suicidal thoughts ‘on several occasions’ but said he had never done anything. 10:42 KEY EVENT When officers were murdered, 'his life changed' \nThe inquest has been told that Mr Summerscales was ‘very good friends’ with Pcs Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone Pc Fiona Bone (left) and Pc Nicola Hughes \nJoshua said their deaths affected his father greatly and from that point on ‘his life changed’ as he struggled to come to terms with it. Joshua had not realised how affected his father had been by the events, and was given the impression that he was coping. \nWhen Mr Summerscales left GMP in 2015 he started working as a delivery driver. Joshua said there was never any indication that his father was struggling. 10:39 'Very hard working' \nMr Summerscales’ son Joshua has told the court that his father was brought up in Oldham and joined GMP in 2001. \nJoshua described him as very hard working, loyal and early on in his career loved his job. He loved motorbikes and football and was a Liverpool FC fan who had been at Hillsborough during the tragedy, his son tells the coroner. \nJoshua and Andrew had attended the Hillsborough memorial service at Anfield a couple of years ago and spoke about the tragedy ‘now and again’. 10:31 Inquest to begin shortly \nCoroner Joanne Kearsley has offered her condolences to the members of Mr Summerscales’ family, many of whom have attended today.
