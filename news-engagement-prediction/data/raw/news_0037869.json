(Photo: Tommy Gilligan, USA TODAY Sports) 10 CONNECT 24 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTweet! \nThat loud, shrill noise you just heard was me blowing my whistle and calling a flagrant foul on Tom Izzo. \nThe Michigan State basketball coach was out of bounds Tuesday night when he tried to get ESPN basketball analyst Dan Dakich censured by his employer. \nIn his news conference after the Spartans’ 74-66 win over Ohio State at the Breslin Center, Izzo went on the offensive, attacking Dakich for comments made in a Twitter war with Spartans fans after last week’s 86-57 blowout loss to Michigan. \nIn a series of since-deleted tweets, Dakich called MSU fans whiny and suggested that one person typed like he was drunk. \nThe biggest bomb he dropped? Ah, yes. Old reliable. MSU fans are jealous of Michigan. \n“Sparty not only whines but now just dumb!! Couldn’t get into UM??” Dakich wrote. \nOstensibly, Izzo was standing up for his school's honor when he demanded that Dakich apologize to MSU fans and students. It was almost the only thing he could do. \nThe problem is that Izzo went too far and should know better. Izzo hates Twitter, yet he willingly jumped down the rabbit hole to chase after Dakich. Izzo is right to dislike Twitter, a hair-trigger medium that often turns into a cesspool of outrageous invective and personal attacks. \nSo why engage, Tom? Twitter’s landscape could best be described by this quote often attributed to Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw: “I learned long ago, never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it.” \nDakich was working Tuesday's game for ESPN, so the Izzone took the opportunity to chant, “We hate Dakich,” throughout the broadcast. Izzo said the only thing that saved him from leading those chants himself was being ignorant of Dakich’s tweets until after the game. \nIzzo then went off the rails. He suggested it’s inappropriate — “a disappointment” and “ridiculous” — for Dakich to work Michigan games when his son, Andrew, plays for the Wolverines. At this point, you would almost expect Izzo to have channeled his inner Kevin Costner from “JFK” and pulled out charts explaining a conspiracy theory that ties Andrew Dakich, Jim Harbaugh and Tom Crean to an elaborate shadow government within the Big Ten. \nIt didn’t stop there. Izzo saved his most cutthroat comment for last, when he suggested that ESPN put its hands around Dakich’s throat and squeeze. “I am surprised ESPN would let somebody say something like that, that works for them,” Izzo said. \nLet’s get something straight. Dakich is no saint. He definitely pushed the boundary of what I would consider appropriate as a media professional. And he seemed to tacitly acknowledge as much by deleting his tweets — yet another cowardly mechanism that Twitter offers. \nBut Dakich’s job is to offer opinions, and he’s good at it. If you think he should stick to opining about basketball, think twice. Not only is freedom of speech one of our country’s most precious rights, but the strong opinions Dakich gives are what makes him interesting and, frankly, unique among his colleagues. \nAnd let’s not forget that Dakich started his fight on Twitter and he kept it there. He even showed that he knows how to exit the pigpen and take the high road. During Tuesday’s game, he retweeted a selfie he took with a fan at Breslin while both held a sign that read: “Dan Dakich pays for Tinder.” Dakich also signed it and wrote, “Go Sparty!!” Always had unreal respect for Coach Izzo MSU hoops+its fans! Reached out to Tom this AM to clear the air..Look forward 2 that conversation — Dan Dakich (@dandakich) February 15, 2017 \nIf Dakich made a mistake, it was going on Twitter to begin with. No one wins on Twitter. He didn’t walk across MSU’s campus pushing down cheerleaders and defiling the Sparty statue. He never used foul language. \nIf you think Izzo is completely right and Dakich is completely wrong, try this. Reverse the roles. Let’s say Izzo had gone on a Twitter rant about Dakich and ESPN. Then Dakich held a news conference and talked about Izzo’s son and suggested that MSU should punish or fire Izzo. What would you think of Dakich then? \nContact Carlos Monarrez: cmonarrez@freepress.com.
