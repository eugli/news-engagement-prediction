Source: Supplied \nRED DWARF WORLDS \nTRAPPIST-1 is a small red dwarf star — barely bigger than the planet Jupiter — on the cooler end of the spectrum. But red dwarfs are the most common type of star in our galaxy.\nUp to 50 per cent of the Milky Way is made up of red dwarfs.\nThat there are seven potentially habitable worlds in orbit around just one of these has enormous implications for the odds of there being alien life.\nAnd any such life is likely to be very odd, given the alien environment.\nSPECIAL FEATURE: On red dwarf worlds, it’s life - but not as we know it \nRed Dwarf Worlds by Steve Grice on Sketchfab \nSPECIAL FEATURE: Different. Deadly. Alien. Life on red dwarf worlds \nBut co-author Amaury Triaud from the Institute of Astronomy in Cambridge, UK, says it is very hard to know if such an abundance of Earth-like planets is common.\nAs for hosting life, there are complications.\nProfessor Gillon and colleagues emphasise that further observations are required to thoroughly detail the nature of these planets — especially the seventh. This outermost planet has not yet had its orbital period defined.\nGiven TRAPPIST-1 is just 39 light years away, this opens up the opportunity for much more detailed observation of the planets as a new generation of telescopes come online, including the Hubble-replacement space-based telescope, the James Webb Telescope next year.\nAnother specialist planet-hunter will also be launched in 2018, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite .\nAn extrapolation of the TRAPPIST-1 red dwarf planets compared to the rocky worlds in our own Solar System. Picture: NASA Source: Supplied \nTHE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION \nWith seven worlds all orbiting so close to one another, they may be ‘pulling’ on each other in unusual ways.\n“It’s a very small, very compact system,” says ays Emmanual Jehin, a co-author on the study. “The seven planets are all included well inside the orbit of Mercury.”\nSuch gravitaitonal ‘squeezing’ could heat up the planets’ cores.\nThis is significant.\nIt could do to the seventh ice world what is happening with moons like Europa and Enceladus: melt water under its ice surface. Again, this brings with it the potential for life.\nIt could also contribute towards giving the worlds a magnetic field - a protective shield against the red dwarf’s solar flares.\n“This star is extremely quiet compared to other very small stars. It’s very calm compared to Proxima Centauri, for example,” Jehin says. “If we’re optimistic, at least five of the planets—maybe not the first and maybe not the last—but at least five could have some liquid water on the surface, if they have atmospheres and the right pressures.”\nRed dwarf worlds GETTING A LIFE \nDebate continues raging among astrobiologists and astrophysicists as to whether or not planets around small — but active — red dwarf stars can hold an atmosphere long enough for microbial life to take hold.\nThis is because such worlds need to orbit close to the star for the required warmth, which in turn brings them within the reach of solar flares. Such flares could strip away atmospheres over time, as well as regularly irradiate the planet’s surface.\nThese planets are also likely to be ‘tidal locked’ — orbiting with one face permanently turned towards the star, and the other in perpetual darkness. The result would be an environment utterly unlike our own.\n“It’s possible their atmospheres are very similar to the Earth, or Venus, or something completely different,” Professor Gillon says.\nEarth and the Sun, left, compared to Kepler 452b and its star. Picture: NASA Source: Supplied \nALIEN COMPANION \nThe discovery of potentially habitable exoplanets around TRAPPIST-1 follows a similar announcement by NASA in July 2015: The discovery of ‘Earth’s cousin’, or Kepler 452b .\nThis world is exciting as it is just 1.6 times larger than Earth, and in orbit around a yellow star similar to our own Sun.\nWhile very little can be discerned from the ‘blip’ the planet makes when it passes between us and its star, it is believed it is both rocky and capable of supporting an atmosphere.\nEXPLORE MORE: What is Kepler 452b like? \nDELVE DEEPER: The search for Earth 2.0 \nOnce again, exactly what form the planet takes is almost entirely speculation.\nChances are, Kepler 452b is another Venus.\nAt six billion years, it’s an old world. It is likely to have double our gravity.\nBut its star is both 20 per cent larger than our own and puts out about 10 per cent more energy.\nThis means Kepler 452b, which sits on the inner edge of the ‘goldilocks zone’, is likely to be a bit steamy.\nThat means a climate cascade towards a greenhouse effect — like Venus — is likely.\nRed dwarf worlds: Different.
