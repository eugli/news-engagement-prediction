Carruthers was joined by a string of trustees. \nThe following day, provincial education minister Mitzie Hunter added her voice to the chorus. \nIn a statement delivered by her son at Tuesday's meeting, the 82-year-old offered a voluntary three to six-month sanction from her post. She wrote she was heartsick after being heard allegedly using the \"n-word\" to refer to mother-of-three, Charline Grant â€” something she claimed was the result of poor judgement caused by a brain injury.
