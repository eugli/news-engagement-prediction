The group said it is focused on its quest, which is the total freedom of Biafra. A statement by IPOB's spokesperson Powerful Emma said the group cannot be part of any individual or organization clamoring for such agenda. Emma said: \"We are not in the business of campaigning for the restructure of Nigeria, we are 100% focused on the puritanical pursuit of the restoration and liberation of Biafra from tyranny.\" READ ALSO: Jubilation as court releases IPOB member He said such individuals or groups, \"have continued to shamelessly tag IPOB to their myriad of names in the hope of misleading our people into following them into their evil Nigerian politics.\" He also said an elders council which was established by Nnamdi Kanu before his arrest was dissolved in 2014 after the group discovered the elders were campaigning for President Muhammadu Buhari. \"We stopped them then and we shall stop them now no matter the party they intend to use to achieve their satanic purpose disguised as patriotism for Biafra. \"These criminals keep dancing from one project of shame to another have been using the revered name of IPOB to dupe desperate politicians. First these criminals said Biafra will come by legal method. When that failed, they said it would come through diplomatic means.

This is their last ditch desperate attempt to immerse themselves in the sell-out politics of Nigeria. We IPOB say we are not part of it,\" Emma said. He added that the IPOB is also not involved in Nigerian politics or with any politician. Emma said no member of the group is into politics. \"IPOB family members worldwide are not politicians but freedom fighters diligently pursuing the restoration of ancient nation of Biafra with truth and honesty. We are not going to derail from this divine pursuit of liberating our people from the shackles of bondage and slavery from Nigeria come what may. \"We the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and it's leadership worldwide warn those involving IPOB under the command and leadership structure of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu with the forthcoming electioneering politics of Anambra State under the constitution of Nigeria should desist from doing so forthwith.

IPOB is not and can never be part of any electioneering in the Luggardian contraption we have come to know as Nigeria. Anybody telling you IPOB is supporting any political party is a deceiver and should be stone. \"IPOB under the leadership of the prophet of our time Mazi Nnamdi Kanu are not part of these treacherous anti-Biafra meetings going on in the homes of some washed out politicians and can never be part of it,\" t he group said. ​ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T15:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T10:04:21.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
