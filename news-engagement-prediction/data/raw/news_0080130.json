ANDREW GORRIE/FAIRFAX NZ \nA man looks out the broken window at 1 Willis St in 2002 when it was the BNZ Tower. \nThe latest incident of glass breaking - seemingly spontaneously - was in January, but similarly broken windows have become a semi-regular event in the Golden Mile building. \nREAD MORE: \nCalls and emails sent to the highrise's owner, Precinct Properties, have not been responded to. ROSS GIBLIN/FAIRFAX NZ \nEscalators to the foodcourt at 1 Willis St were blocked off after a window shattered in September, 2015 \nAfter the January case Precinct emailed some - but seemingly not all - tenants saying glaziers had highlighted the likely cause, though \"Precinct Properties is not concerned that such breakages will become a common occurrence\". \nThe email warned all furniture should be at least 10cm from windows. \nItems \"like posters and bags\" should not be placed against the glass because it could \"cause differentials in heat build-up and therefore increase the thermal stress of the glass\", the email said. MONIQUE FORD/FAIRFAX NZ \nTenants have been warned about glass problems. \nThe guidelines may help to prevent similar breakages in the future, it said. Ad Feedback \nAccording to the email, the problem could be caused in numerous ways including impacts to the glass, thermal stresses, and installation damage eventually developing into larger breaks, though the latter would normally happen in early life of the building. \nIt could also be caused by problems in how the glass was bound to the frame, causing stresss to develop as the glass expanded and contracted. \nInadequate glass thickness was another potential issue as was \"internal defects within the glass such as nickel sulphide inclusions\". \nNickel sulphide inclusion is a well-documented problem caused by microscopic bits of metal accidentally inside the glass. \nThey can sit benignly there for years before causing a window to shatter in microseconds. \n1 Willis St has had at least four windows smash with no readily-apparent reason. \nIn January, a window fell from the 15th storey of the building ​, injuring nobody but cordons were placed on Willis St. \nIn 2015, a large glass pane shattered and glass fell on escalators below with a sound one witness described as like \" 1000 plates breaking \". \nIn 2014, a window shattered and fell about 12 storeys to the canopy and street below . \nIn 2002 another window shattered, raining glass on the street below. \nThe building was designed in the late 1960s, but not opened till 1984 at a cost of $93 million – more than four times over budget. \nIt was the city's tallest building until 1991, when The Majestic Centre was completed further up Willis St. \nPrecinct Properties in the email also told tenants not to worry about scratches on the inside and outside faces of the glass that were likely caused by cleaning \"and have no impact on the glass fracturing\". - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:09:55.773+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
