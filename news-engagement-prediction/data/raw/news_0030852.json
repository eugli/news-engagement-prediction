The movie is written by filmmaker James Gunn ( Guardians of the Galaxy ), directed by Greg McLean ( Wolf Creek ), and stars John Gallagher Jr., Tony Goldwyn, John C. McGinley, Adria Arjona, Josh Brener, and Michael Rooker, among others. \n“ Belko is an incredibly crazy script,” McLean told EW last year. “There’s nothing else like it. Trust me. It’s a wild, wild movie. I’m so glad I got to direct it. James was great. We have a similar sensibility over the movies we like and the references we like. So, we clicked over those things.
