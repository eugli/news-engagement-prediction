It's about these characters. You are in service to these stories and these characters.\" \nIn \"Moonlight,\" Ali's Juan teaches young Chiron to swim and encourages him to not be weighed down by his environment but rather to carve his own destiny. \nAli also appeared in another Oscar-nominated movie this year, \"Hidden Figures,\" in which he plays a US colonel who woos Taraji P. Henson's black female mathematician in the 1960s. \nThe Oakland, California, actor is probably best known for playing former White House Chief of Staff Remy Danton in Netflix's political drama \"House of Cards,\" and conniving Cottonmouth in Netflix's Marvel superhero series \"Luke Cage.\" \nAli's career has spanned television, film and theatre. He started out playing a doctor on TV series \"Crossing Jordan\" in 2001, and since then has had roles in dozens of projects including TV series \"Treme\" and \"Alphas.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T17:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T11:26:32.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
