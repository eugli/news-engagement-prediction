The most important thing is our guys prepare and play the game right.\" The team enacted the rule prior to Mattingly's first season with the Marlins, and he admitted Tuesday that he instituted the policy as a way to make the team a more cohesive unit. \"A little bit last year for me was being in a new situation and wanting to make sure the team was put first, and it wasn't going to be about personal things,\" he said, per the AP. Mattingly reportedly said players are still required to be \"well-groomed,\" but they will have more freedom when it comes to growing facial hair under that banner. \"Now you feel like you're not so under control,\" closer A.J. Ramos said, according to the AP. \"You can fend for yourself. You can do what you want, and we can stop hearing the crying.\" Like the new article format? !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:24:22.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
