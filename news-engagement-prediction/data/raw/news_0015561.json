A flood of mosquitos \nHeavy spring rainfall across north-east Victoria and southern New South Wales is one of the main contributing factors to the rise of Ross River fever cases. \nMosquitos flock to stagnant water to lay, grow and develop their eggs, and to feed. \nMunicipalities that were hit by the floods — including Shepparton, Albury Wodonga, Mildura, Swan Hill, Campaspe and Moira — began mosquito spraying programs to target breeding sites in stagnant waters late last year. \nBut the measures have only put a small dent in the booming mosquito population. \n\"Certainly the wet weather that we had in spring allowed lots of mosquitos to breed, and the number of mosquitos was much higher in our traps than we usually see that time of year,\" Ms Oakman said.

(Supplied) Ross River symptoms can last up to a year \nFever, joint and muscle aches, and fatigue are some of the symptoms people struck down with Ross River fever suffer, with the onset of symptoms happening between three days and three weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito. \nThe virus is found in most regions of Australia, particularly around waterways. \nCases can also be influenced by environmental factors such as flooding, humidity and temperature. \nFever, nausea and skin rashes usually disappear within the first two weeks of illness, but joint and muscle pain may last much longer. \nWhile some adults recover within a fortnight, others can still suffer up to a year later. \nThe only way for a person to be properly diagnosed as having the virus is through a blood test.

(ABC Goulburn Murray: Erin Somerville) Sufferers find support online \nThe significant outbreak of Ross River on the New South Wales-Victoria border has prompted sufferers to turn to an online support group for help and advice. How to avoid bites: Screen all windows and doors to prevent mosquitoes from coming inside Avoid being outside unprotected, particularly during dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active. When outside cover up as much as possible with light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing and covered footwear Apply mosquito repellent regularly to exposed areas. Repellents containing diethyl toluamide (DEET) or picaridin are best. Repellents containing oil of lemon eucalyptus or p-Menthane-3.8-diol (PMD) also provides adequate protection Don't use repellents on the skin of children under the age of three months. Instead use physical barriers such as netting on prams, cots and play areas for babies Light mosquito coils or use vaporising mats indoors. Devices that use light to attract and electrocute insects are not effective When mosquitoes are present inside the room, use over-the-counter insecticide sprays, especially behind furniture and dark places When camping, use flyscreens, or sleep under mosquito nets Limit the number of places around your home for mosquitoes to breed by getting rid of items that hold water or by emptying the containers — Source: Murrumbidgee Local Health District \nThe Border Ross River Fever Support Group on Facebook is being used to help bring together people who have contracted the virus, to share their experiences, symptoms and treatments. \nSimone Vescio, who lives in the region, began the online project in January after she was diagnosed with the virus. \nShe said it was a debilitating condition. \n\"I think the actual word of 'flu like symptoms' is just so minimal,\" she said. \n\"I've had the flu and if you could times that by 10 it's literally what you're starting to feel when Ross River does hit.\" \nMs Vescio said members of the support group were being helped by sharing the painful experience. \n\"I think what is great in the community is we're realising it's not in our head,\" she said. \n\"I think when you're saying you're this debilitated and can't get out of bed, can't get to work, and there's other people saying the same things, you just don't feel like you're alone in this awful journey.\" \nMs Vescio said she was seeing a range of people who had been affected by the virus, from young sportsmen through to the elderly. \nShe said people with Ross River fever were experiencing a range of symptoms and were looking to different methods for help, including natural therapies, paracetamol, anti-inflammatories and opioids.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:12:31.723+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
