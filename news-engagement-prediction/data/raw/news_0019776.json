(Facebook) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Friday, February 10, 2017, 9:31 PM \nA Queens grand jury has indicted two men for blackmailing a 14-year-old girl into sex using a nude video of her as leverage. \nAlbert Premnauth, 23, of Richmond Hill and Jacob Marcial, 18, of Kew Gardens were charged with corrupting the girl Friday between Jan. 1 and March 8, 2016. \nProsecutors said the girl initially sent the naked video of herself to another girl as a joke, using Snapchat. That friend then shared the video with Marcial. \nMarcial owed Premnauth for a marijuana debt. Marcial told the girl who made the video that if she didn’t have sex with Premnauth to clear his debt, he would publicly post it. \nMarcial got the girl to meet Premnauth at his house. The girl pleaded with the men, telling Premnauth she was only 14 and begged him to give her time to pay him Marcial’s debt, rather than submit to sex. \nPremnauth demanded sex, and then engaged in sex acts with the girl. \n“In spite of her crying and pleas that she was only fourteen years old and begging the other defendant to give her time to pay the money owed him instead of engaging in sexual intercourse with him, he refused,” Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said. Prenauth and Jacob Marcia, 18, were charged with corrupting the girl Friday between Jan. 1 and March 8, 2016.

The girl gave the money and the headphones to Marcial, who then sold them to repay Premnauth. \nMarcial was charged with sex trafficking, promotion of prostitution, rape and illegal sex acts. Premauth was charged with rape, illegal sex acts and coercion. \nMarcial faces up to 25 years in prison, while Premnauth faces up to seven years in prison. \nThey were arraigned Friday and bail was set at $15,000 bond. \n\"This case tragically demonstrates the danger of children sending explicit images or videos of themselves to their friends or posting them on social media — even as a joke,” Brown said. \n“Once a young person sends or posts an image or video, they lose control of that image and who has it or how it is used.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T09:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:53:21.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
