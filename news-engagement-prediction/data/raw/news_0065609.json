The senior leader equated madrassas to schools run by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and claimed both spread `hatred'. Muslim groups and political parties have slammed Singh for his remarks on Twitter. Singh took to the microblogging site to write, \"Is there a difference between Madarsas and Saraswati Shishu Mandir Schools run by RSS ? I don't think so. Both spread Hatred. (sic).\" \nIs there a difference between Madarsas and Saraswati Shishu Mandir Schools run by RSS ? I don't think so. Both spread Hatred. â€” digvijaya singh (@digvijaya_28) 1487727508000 Strong reactions poured in from various Muslim organisations, including the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen(MIM). Asaduddin Owaisi, the MIM president, objec ted to Singh's tweet. He asked Muslim socio-religious organisations, including the Jamiat-e-Ulama Hind, to take note of this `hatred'. Senior Congress leader and State Minorities chairman Abid Rasool Khan too expressed displeasure. He said, \"Madrassas provide edu cation, clothing and food to those from the weakest of sections. This statement sent a wrong signal and must be retracted immediately.\" In a terse reaction, Hafiz Peer Shabbir, Jamiat-e-Ulama Hind, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh chief, said he unequivocally condemns Singh's statement. \"I want him (Digvijaya Singh) to show me if any madrassa has weapons stashed in it? This is a part of a larger conspiracy which seeks to have no imams, muftis and aalims,\" he said even as he pointed out that several madrassas now teach their students `contemporary' subjects such as English and Mathematics apart from having programmes on computer literacy to help students have a bright future.
