She is always at the back of my mind,” she said. A photo posted by Sridevi Kapoor (@sridevi.kapoor) on Jan 28, 2017 at 10:00pm PST \n“After you become a mother, the instinct comes naturally. You don’t have to learn motherhood,” she added. \nSridevi who made a comeback with Gauri Shinde’s English Vinglish in 2011, will be soon seen in Mom. \nDirected by Ravi Udyawar and produced by Boney Kapoor and Sridevi, the film stars Sridevi, Akshaye Khanna and Abhimanyu Singh in the main cast and Nawazuddin Siddiqui in a special appearance. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:36:03.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
