'Game-changer' \nThe transatlantic routes will be served by the new Boeing 737 Max aircraft. \nNorwegian already flies from Edinburgh to six destinations - Copenhagen, Oslo, Stockholm, Barcelona, Tenerife and Malaga. \nNorwegian chief executive Bjorn Kjos said: \"The cost of transatlantic travel has been too high for too long, so by connecting Scotland with smaller US airports, we can offer some truly affordable fares, allowing as many people as possible to fly. \nEdinburgh Airport chief executive Gordon Dewar said: \"These new, low-cost direct services between Scotland's capital city and the east coast of America are a real game-changer - making travel between these two parts of the world easier than ever before and opening up possibilities to more business and leisure passengers than ever before.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:33:37.468+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
