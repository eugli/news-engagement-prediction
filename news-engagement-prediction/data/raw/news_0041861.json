(Kent Smith/NBAE/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  05 AM \nThe way it should work out with Charles Oakley is this: Someday he shouldn’t just stand as some ceremonial old Knick at center court at Madison Square Garden, which still was a mecca of something other than losing basketball games and bad management when he was Patrick Ewing’s wing man. No, Oak should be there when his No. 34 goes to the rafters at the Garden. He was a great Knick, in the last good time at the place, and his jersey belongs at the top of the place, even if all his best work was done in the trenches. \nJeff Van Gundy said that in the Daily News this week, then said it to me. But with me he was preaching to the choir. I first wrote about Oak’s jersey belonging in the rafters a long time ago, believed it then and believe it now, and not because of what happened with Garden security last week. \n“His number should be retired, one hundred percent,” Van Gundy said, and then referenced Scottie Pippen, who became an all-time Top 50 player in the NBA providing backup and support for Michael Jordan, partly, as Jeff said, because he was one of the best off-the-ball defenders in basketball history. \nThen Jeff said that Oakley was that kind of wing man underneath the basket for and with Ewing, in the only glory years the Knicks have had since the 1970s. He was all that even if the Knicks of the 90s never managed to win it all. \nThis all comes up, of course, because Oak has been back in the news for the past week or so, for all the wrong reasons. It has obscured the fact that the one who really needs to be brought back to the Garden someday, as coach, even if it’s as an assistant coach at first, is Patrick Ewing himself. It is time. Past time. \nIt is the kind of respect Ewing needs to be shown in the place where he became the second-greatest player the Knicks have ever had, after Clyde. There is no disrespect meant here to all the other Hall of Famers who played with Clyde. Nothing against Willis Reed, who played his entire NBA career as a Knick, or Dave DeBusschere, who came here from Detroit and helped changed everything in the late ’60s, or Earl Monroe, who came here from Baltimore. Nothing against Bernard King. But when you look at Ewing’s entire body of work, and the way he carried the franchise on his back and finally on his aching knees, the only one, truly, who had a better career for the Knicks was Clyde. Only now Patrick is working for Michael in Charlotte, not in New York, and that finally needs to change next season, even though what really needs to change in Ewing’s coaching career is that somebody needs to make him a head coach in the NBA. \nFirst, though, he needs to come back to New York. We know how loyal Phil Jackson is to Kurt Rambis, and how much he wanted Rambis to be the head coach. Now Rambis sits next to Jeff Hornacek and is supposed to be in charge of the Knicks’ defense, which is as wretched as there is in the league, and sure was in the last game in Oklahoma City before the All-Star break. Patrick Ewing was a Knick, is a Knick, and will always be a Knick. (ADAM NADEL/AP) \nOne of these days James Dolan, or somebody else at the Garden, should show that same kind of loyalty to Patrick Ewing, who honored the place with his talent and work ethic, who kept coming on bad knees, who came back from a shattered wrist that altered his shooting form and touch from the time it happened on a night in Milwaukee in 1997, when he was knocked to the floor by Andrew Lang. And Knick fans with memories will always wonder how the history of the team would have changed and how Ewing’s personal history would have changed if John Starks had thrown the ball into him at the end of Game 6 in the 1994 Finals instead of taking the jumper that he’d decided was going to win the Knicks their first championship since 1973. \nIt wasn’t Starks’ shot to take. If there was going to be a ball in the air for another Knicks championship, on that team and in that time, it should have been Patrick Ewing taking the shot. We all know he was traded to Seattle at the end of his career, but people barely remember him in that uniform, or playing a minute for them, outside the night he came back to the Garden and heard the cheers one more time. But Ewing was a Knick, is a Knick, will always be a Knick. And if there is not a place for him in the organization, if there is not a place for him on their bench after all the time he has spent as an assistant coach in the league, then that is just another shame on 33rd Street. Thirty-three, by the way. His number. \nEwing was never treated as shabbily as Oak was, all the way through the ugliness of last week. He was never banned from the Garden. But if there is one Knick who deserves better at the modern Garden, and that means Dolan’s Garden, it is Patrick Ewing. \n“You tell me,” Jeff Van Gundy said to me the other day, “what Top 50 player has ever spent as much time trying to be a head coach in the NBA as Patrick has.” \nThen Jeff said that no one ever has. \nI knew Patrick as well as anybody who ever covered him. I talked a lot of basketball with him over the years, on and off the record. In a way he was a little bit like Mariano Rivera was when he’d sit in front of his locker and talk baseball around the Yankees. Mo didn’t make a big deal about how much he knew about his game. But then you got him going, and you realized his insights were as smart as anybody’s in the room. It was like that with Patrick, even though all anybody wants to remember is the silly playoff predictions he would make. \nVan Gundy talked about how there is sometimes an anti-big-man bias when it comes to ex-players, even great ex-players, who have gone into coaching, as if only guys who played positions other than center truly understand basketball. Maybe this has come into play with Ewing. Maybe that is why he can’t make the move to the end of the bench, even though he has now been an assistant coach (he started with the Wizards in ’02) as long as he was a player. \n“He’s not a self-promoter,” Hornets head coach Steve Clifford said of Patrick a couple of years ago. \nStill Ewing sits next to Clifford in Charlotte. I can’t tell you that he will ever become a head coach in the NBA, as much as he has earned his chance, and paid his dues. But if he is going to remain an assistant coach next season, it should be at the Garden. The first Knick who should truly be welcomed home is No. 33, whether No. 34 makes it back first or not. The enemy, bumbling Jets & Yankee pitching ... \n- I sometimes wonder whether Jimmy Breslin and Pete Hamill, and Murray Kempton and Red Smith and Dave Anderson, all knew that what they were doing in their long and honorable newspaper careers was actually acting as enemies of the state. \nWe must have buried the lead with them. \n- Wait, Darrelle Revis is still hitting people? \nIt is amazing sometimes, when you think about it, what cover the Knicks often provide for the Jets. \nAnd for the owner of the Jets. \nHe’s apparently waiting to be our next ambassador to Great Britain. \nHis fans? \nThey’re waiting for his team to be a real team again. \nThey’re waiting for a quarterback. \nThe news around the Knicks last week, maybe you heard about it, was all about Oak. \nThe news around the Jets this week is about Revis, who now seems to be about as much of the Jets’ past as Oak is with the Knicks. \nBut when is there going to be some good news around the New York Jets? \nI have to level: I don’t care which Patriots plan to go to the White House and which ones don’t. \nPaul George says he won’t commit to signing a new deal with the Pacers and, guess what? \nIf you were George, neither would you. \n- Don Winslow, who is one of the best writers on the planet, and who has a big New York City cop novel coming out in a few months, said the other day that “Dodgers” by Bill Beverly is one of the best books he has read in a very long time. \nThat was enough of a rave to get me to buy the book. \nBut it’s Beverly’s talent, and the world he’s created, that kept me reading it. The news around the Jets this week is about Darrelle Revis, who now seems to be about as much of the Jets’ past as Charles Oakley is with the Knicks. (Jared Wickerham/for New York Daily News) \n- Rob Manfred is absolutely right in wanting to find any and all ways to speed up baseball, but it’s worth noting that the network big shots who want the NFL to pick up the pace happen to be on to something, too. \nAnd when we get all that squared away, we can start working on the four-hour college football game. \nI’m just trying to connect the dots here, but if the leaks are real and the news is fake, does that mean the news about the leaks is fake or real? \n- Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, but do the Yankees have enough starting pitching to contend for something other than the second wild card in the American League? \nI think they’re going to score. \nAnd we know what the late innings are going to be like with Betances and Chapman. \nBut Yankee fans don’t want to talk about all the free agents who are eventually supposed to come running down 161st Street in a couple of years. \nThey don’t want to wait until next year, or the one after that, as well as the Yankees are supposed to be set up for the future. \nThey’re supposed to keep spending money on this year. \nThey want to believe Brian Cashman when he says they’re not waving any white flags in the American League East. \nOur worst fears have been realized, right? \nDonald Trump just won’t accept the result of the election.
