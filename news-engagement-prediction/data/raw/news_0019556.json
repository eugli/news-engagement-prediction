While it only won four of it's twelve Oscar nominations, they were the most important awards of the show, Best Actor, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture. Tom Hooper, the director, should be very pleased with himself, for this was not only his first win, but first nomination. He used an excellent screenplay by David Seidler, filled with romance, comedy, drama, and even nail-biting suspence(not in the sense you would think), and combined it with masterful acting by Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter, to make one of the greatest films of all time. I think what gave this the advantage over \"The Social Network\" was that while \"Network\" was a very great, well-done film, it didn't have any heroes to root for, while \"The King's Speech\" had plenty of those. I myself believe that this film will stand the test of time much longer than the \"The Social Network\", but both movies are still very good.Overall, \"The King's Speech\" is without question the best film of 2010, and I can't wait to see what Tom Hooper has in store for us in the future. Two Thumbs Way, WAY UP!\"Forget everything else, and just say it to me. Say it to me as a friend.\" - Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue to Colin Firth as King George VI If you watch it first, you will understand why this movie won the oscar for best picture by LaMays This is the best movie of the year by far! Colin Firth is the best he has ever been, Helena Bohnam Carter is fantastic, and Gefoffrey Rush is perfect! Tom Hooper is an amazing director and they all were major contributions to the best movie of the year 2010! 100 STARS! by MOOOvies LOVED IT! Such a moving movie that made you wanna laugh, cry, and say \"awww.\" When I saw the movie, i could really relate to the King. Maybe I've never had a speech probelm, but i think we can all relate to embaressment and a desire to please people! It deserved all those oscars!!!! I think its safe to say that it is ALREADY THE BEST MOVIE OF 2011!
