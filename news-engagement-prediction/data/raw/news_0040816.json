By Russ Bengtson Senior Editor, senior citizen. \nMore info: Twitter / Facebook / Google+ \n  The 1984 NBA All-Star Game, played at McNichols Arena in Denver, was the start of something different. The night before the main event consisted of the first-ever NBA Slam-Dunk Contest, which has since gone on to be a marquee event for the League’s best. All-Star Weekend ’84 marked the start of a sprawl that would eventually take over the better part of an entire week. But even this was prologue. Because it was the following year that would see the debut of Michael Jordan . \nJordan, then a heralded rookie out of North Carolina, was named to the 1985 All-Star team and also competed in the dunk contest, where he faced off against—among others—defending champion Larry Nance, all-time legend Julius Erving, and third-year Hawks forward Dominique Wilkins. Jordan finished second to Wilkins, setting off a dunk rivalry that would come to a head three years later in Chicago.\nMichael Jordan wearing the Air Jordan II in the 1987 Dunk Contest.

The image that endures is Jordan, coming out for  warmups  wearing his own black-and-red Air Jordan gear rather than Chicago Bulls sweats, capped off with a pair of gold chains and  the infamous “Banned” black-and-red Air Jordan  1s .  \nIt was an audacious act by an audacious player, marketing his upcoming line on live TV a week before he turned 22. Again, this was something different.\nThe next day, Jordan paid the price for his perceived arrogance. Lacing up his traditional red, white, and black game shoes for the All-Star Game, Jordan scored just 7 points in 22 minutes—his nine shots were the fewest of any East starter. Rumor was he was frozen out of the offense, in part because of his actions the night before. “There were reports the other NBA all-stars were turned off by Jordan`s behavior at the slam-dunk contest,”  wrote  the Chicago Tribune’s  Bob Sakamoto  the next day, “when he went through the first round in his warm-up outfit while the other seven competitors were in their uniforms.” \nMichael Jordan wearing the Air Jordan 1 in the 1985 Dunk Contest. Image via Getty/Andrew D. Bernstein George Gervin, appearing in his 12th and final All-Star game, was quoted as saying, “Michael is a rookie and he has a lot to learn, just like we all did.” Jordan learned his lesson, all right. But it may not have been the one Gervin—who would find himself Jordan’s teammate in Chicago the following season—was talking about. When the first Air Jordans released that April, they sold out immediately. \nAfter missing the All-Star game and dunk contest the following season due to a broken foot that sidelined him for much of the season, Jordan made his return in 1987 in triumphant fashion. He left the Nike warmups at home, but once again broke out two different pairs of his signature sneakers, wearing the white, black and red Air Jordan IIs as he won his first dunk contest, then a white and red pair in Sunday’s game, where he scored 11 points on 12 shots in an East loss. Seattle’s Tom Chambers won MVP. The All-Star sneaker trend that Jordan established in 1985 was locked in in 1987, but this was just setting the table for 1988. \nWhat would prove to be the most pivotal year in Air Jordan—and, at least up to that point, Michael Jordan—history started exceptionally well, no matter how you consider it. He scored 36 points in the first game of the 87-88 season, and posted a triple-double (25 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists) in the first game of 1988. With the All-Star Game set to take place in Chicago for the first time since 1973, Jordan and Nike had big plans. \nSaid plans revolved not only around Jordan himself in his home arena, but around the Air Jordan III, the first Air Jordan designed by Tinker Hatfield, which would debut in Saturday’s Dunk Contest as Jordan defended his crown.\nFor the first time since 1985, Jordan would match up with Wilkins, who lost to teammate Spud Webb in 1986, then missed the ‘87 contest with an injury of his own. Nike would also debut a new ad campaign, shot in black-and-white by and starring a young filmmaker from Brooklyn named Spike Lee . “Hang Time,” the first in the series, started with Lee standing on Jordan’s shoulders and ended with him getting dunked on while still clinging to the rim. Lee’s motormouthed Mars Blackmon character did all the talking, the shoes took center stage.\nImage via Getty/Nathaniel S. Butler POST CONTINUES BELOW And, in Chicago, Jordan himself did the same. He defeated Wilkins in a dunk contest for the ages in white  IIIs  before scoring 40 points on Sunday in the black versions, winning his first All-Star MVP honors. By the end of the season he’d have a full trophy case, adding the Defensive Player of the Year and MVP trophies to his collection for the first time. \nSneaker-wise though, everything peaked in February. Up until that point Jordan hadn’t made it out of the first round of the playoffs, so, for Nike, it made the most sense to debut his latest shoe in mid-season, when all eyes would be on their singular star. That would change for Jordan the following season, as he chose to not defend his Dunk Contest crown for a second time, and he hit his first playoff-series winning shot. But the precedent had been set. All-Star weekend had become prime time for sneakers. All because everyone wanted to be like Mike .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T01:20:35.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
