Our expenditures were likewise. Now we are trying to adjust,” Heitinga said in an interview with 1limburg .\n“In the past, we sometimes chartered a private jet, but we don't do that now. On holidays we do still rent a fancy villa, but you get different categories of 'fancy'.\nHeitinga made over 100 appearances for Everton (Getty) “We are trying to get used to it. Sometimes it is difficult.”\nHeitinga is still a coach at Ajax following his retirement after only making two Eredivisie appearances in the whole of last season – both of which came from the bench.\nOn his retirement, he said: \"My ultimate desire was to return to Amsterdam and at the end of the season as a player for the third time celebrate a championship trophy with the Ajax fans.\n\"The farewell is slightly ahead of schedule. But I look forward to this new chapter in my life.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T13:01:20.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
