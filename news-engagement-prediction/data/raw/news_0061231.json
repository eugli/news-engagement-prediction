This will soon spread to different energy sources,\" it added. \n\nSustainable Development Goals 7 aims to ensure universal access to affordable electricity by 2030 by investing in clean energy sources such as solar, wind and thermal. \n\nThe government's think-tank further noted that like with solar, India needs to ensure large, consistent, competitive procurement for affordability of efficient, low-cost energy sources. \n\nObserving that India's national goals and priorities have subsumed all the sustainable development goals, Aayog said, \"All 17 #SDGs - ending poverty, creating jobs, improving health and education, clean energy, etc - have been key to India's development planning.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:34:10.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
