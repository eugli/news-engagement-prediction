You are hot, young, and better than ever. Plus, you are about to feast on a garlicky, carb-y pasta dish that will send a trillion endorphins running throughout your happy, single-and-ready-to-mingle self. \nTo go along with your cooking journey, I've included a playlist of some of the best, most empowering blues hits in history. There will be no wallowing lyrics, only songs with a beat to help you get your groove on while you cook and dine. \nFirst things first, you will need to prep a whole head of garlic. Do this by smashing the garlic under the flat side of your knife. Carefully but forcefully use the heel of your hand to get the job done. This not only frees the garlic from its papery shells, but it can also help rid you of any tension you're feeling on this day. \nCook the pasta and caramelize the garlic side by side on the stove top. As you're monitoring the magic happening in those pots and pans, make that wooden spoon a mic and passionately sing along. Hey, no one is looking . . . \nPour all those luscious cloves and the accompanying aromatic oil over the pasta. \nOh yes. There are vampire-repelling amounts of garlic in this pasta. Before diving in, there's one last step. \nParmesan. And lots of it. Let it rain. And if you're like me, douse that thing with plenty of salt and freshly ground pepper. \nAh, maybe this day isn't so bad after all. Be sure to raise a glass to toast yourself, because you are an awesome cook, beautiful person, and, yes, V-Day survivor. \nPlay this Spotify playlist while cooking.
