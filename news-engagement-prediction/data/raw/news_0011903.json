REMINISCING \nHe helped shape NXT what it is today, and even enjoyed a short stint as the champion after he dethroned Neville. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Article continues below \nIt all started with Zayn sharing his joy on Twitter with his fans, explaining how he’s enjoyed the last three weeks, and is hopeful of setting the tone for the rest of 2017. SAVAGE TWEETS \nHe posted: “Main-evented Raw. Beat Seth Rollins. Lasted 47 mins in a stacked Royal Rumble. Beat Chris Jericho. The last 3 weeks have been good!” \nOwens jumped in on Twitter, poking fun at something else Zayn did years ago. \nHe replied: “What about the time years ago in Europe when you tried to spit in the water off that bridge but ended up spitting on your own wrist instead?” \nAs usual, Zayn didn’t respond to Owens’ jibes and the following day, he reminded fans it’s his WWE anniversary. \nHe tweeted: “4 years ago today, I went in for my first day on the job with @WWE.” \nAgain, Owens was lurking in his mentions and posted a friendly reminder that he debuted after Zayn, and has still achieved so much more. \nOwens added: “Also, 10 years ago, you spat on your own wrist. Remember that! \n“Kewl!!! Mine was only 2 and a half years ago… #NXTChamp #IntercontinentalChamp (x2) #Universal Champ. But you…you did stuff! You’re ok!” \nOuch. \nIt’s crazy to see how much Owens has achieved in such a short space of time, and that’s including a clean victory over John Cena. \nStill, Sami did stuff, so he’s okay. \nWhat did you make of Kevin Owens’ tweets to Sami Zayn?
