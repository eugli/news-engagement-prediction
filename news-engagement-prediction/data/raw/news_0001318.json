In the referendum campaign, David Cameron and George Osborne used every weapon in their armoury to try to scare and dupe voters. Lavishing public funds on Project Fear, they enlisted support from the supposedly neutral Civil Service and Governor of the Bank of England, while bribing businessmen and think-tanks to join them with hints of gongs. Next, they persuaded President Obama to warn that Britain would be sent to the ‘back of the queue’ for a trade deal if we pulled out (how empty that threat looks, now his successor has put us at the front). As the BBC’s Newsnight reported on Tuesday, Mr Cameron even tried to get the Editor of this newspaper sacked in his desperation to stop the public reading the case for Brexit. And even after 17.4million voters saw through the scaremongering, bullying and lies, diehard Remoaners refused to accept the result. Labour MP Chris Bryant ignored Jeremy Corbyn's three-line whip and voted against the Brexit Bill despite 53 percent of voters in his Rhondda constituency voting for Brexit Thousands took to the streets to march against democracy. Many sought to fob the public off with ‘soft Brexit’, meaning membership of the EU in all but name. Others spread gloom – including Sir Ivan Rogers, our former ambassador to the EU. A classic Foreign Office appeaser, he was at it again yesterday, suggesting Britain will have to pay a £50billion bill for pulling out. Meanwhile, Remoaners went to the courts, persuading a handful of unaccountable judges – with three honourable exceptions – to give MPs the final say, though Parliament had resolved by six-to-one to let the people decide. This brings us back to last night’s crucial vote on the Second Reading of the EU withdrawal Bill, which puts beyond doubt the Government’s right to trigger Brexit before the end of next month. Above all, that thumping 384 majority sends a powerful signal to the Lords that they will sabotage Brexit at their peril. Indeed, with Theresa May four-square behind Brexit, the U.S. joining others eager for trade deals, economists upgrading growth forecasts every week – and countless Remainers switching sides, as they survey the EU’s decline – everything is set fair for a bright future. At last, we’re on our way out, and up. We have lift-off.
