(REUTERS/NASA/Handout () \nWednesday marks the 14th anniversary of the Columbia Space Shuttle disaster, in which seven astronauts lost their lives as the craft broke up during reentry on February 1, 2003. \nMark Kelly, a retired astronaut and the brother of astronaut Scott Kelly— both of whom are known for NASA’s Twin Study — took to Twitter to commemorate the tragic anniversary. \n“Remembering the 7 astronauts lost aboard Columbia 14 years ago today,” he wrote. “They were brave explorers and really good people.” \nThe Columbia Shuttle was the second time the space agency lost a vehicle in a catastrophic accident: the first, of course, was Challenger, in 1986. NASA recently marked another very sad occasion, with the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 1 capsule fire, in which three astronauts died.

Don Beyer (@RepDonBeyer) February 1, 2017 \nNASA ultimately determined the loss of the vehicle stemmed from a foam strike on the Shuttle’s wing during takeoff— that impact created a hole and fatally compromised Columbia while it was reentering the Earth’s atmosphere.
