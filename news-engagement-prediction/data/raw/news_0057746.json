Victory never went into our head and we never got depressed with defeat. We will decide about her stand (resignation),” Danve said. “I personally do not find a valid reason behind her decision to put in papers. I feel people’s issues will not be solved by her resignation,” he added. \n“She is a senior leader and part of our core team. She is upset with Zilla Parishad results and we will try to find amicable solutions to her worries,” he said. \nThe BJP leader also dismissed reports of infighting in the party. “There is no infighting in BJP. We are all working together. Her resignation has nothing to do with BJP and her disappointment with BJP. I have already said BJP would be the number one party (in the state),” he said. \nThe BJP, meanwhile, made significant gain in the BMC, winning over 80 wards, and and is likely to come to power in at least six civic bodies — Pune, Nashik, Ulhasnagar, Akola, Nagpur and Amravati — out of the 10 corporations for which the elections were held on Tuesday. \nOn the other hand, Sanjay Nirupam also resigned as the Congress’ Mumbai chief n the wake of the party’s poor show in the polls. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:47:17.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
