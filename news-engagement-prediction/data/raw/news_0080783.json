While crossing the Andheri bridge around 9.30 pm, the driver grazed her car against another car. She immediately ordered him to pull over and allegedly began creating a ruckus. Sources said there was only a minor scratch on her car.\nPuri hauled the driver to the Oshiwara police station and demanded compensation from the website for the damage. “Service providers should train their drivers well. The company should pay for the damage to my car,” she told mid-day.\nThe driver, however, claimed that there was “no major damage”. “The car only touched another vehicle that had applied its emergency brakes.” The Oshiwara police registered a non-cognisable offence and handed over a copy to Puri to claim insurance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:29:50.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
