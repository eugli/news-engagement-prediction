Attorneys for the state won a temporary pause on Trump's executive order blocking entry to the U.S. by refugees worldwide and certain immigrants from seven Muslim majority nations.\nFor now, those refugees and immigrants are allowed to travel to the U.S. just as they could before Trump's executive order was issued.\nRelated Stories Appeals court rules against Trump's travel ban A look at judges who refused to reinstate Trump's travel ban Read the full text of the court ruling on Trump's travel ban", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/829836231802515457", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/56/75/61/12311652/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/57/02/66/12332439/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/57/04/36/12339133/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:12:22.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
