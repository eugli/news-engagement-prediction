However, he said he's still single and things are \"tough\" as the former couple tries to figure things out. \n\"You know, we're trying to deal with stuff in a more private manner now, obviously, and we just kind of want people to respect that,\" he said. \"Especially because it's a tough situation with the kids, and we don't want to kind of fully dive into anything, because we're thinking about them as well.\" Courtesy Hector Eduardo Gonzalez Hernandez \nLuckily, he did give fans some details about why they decided to meet up. \n\"This is the first time I've seen her in a while. When I came out this week, I came for one of my friend's events, and I did some other stuff while I was here, and we ran into each other and stuff,\" he explained. \"You know, we just had long conversations. They were conversations that needed to be had, and [we had] a great dinner.\" \nHe continued, \"It was a good evening. We had a good time. Whenever we're together, especially outside of the show and outside all the drama, it's always been a good relationship. There were just so many outside forces and outside factors that got involved after we were together on the show, and it was unfortunate for a little bit.\" \nThe couple originally broke up in December. Stanton chatted with E! News in early January, confirming their split when she explained, \"We did break up, and we didn't just come out with a statement. I didn't really know how to go about it—it's kind of a weird thing, but we did break up.\" \nShe added, \"I think it's good to kind of clear the air because I think there's been so many questions and confusion about our relationship. We did decide to go our separate way. It's for the best.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:24:34.651+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
