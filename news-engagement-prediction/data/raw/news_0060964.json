On the one hand, there were the staffers who, after being hired, had to be dismissed last week for failing background checks on issues like substance abuse and credit scores. Then again, the White House has been known to micromanage who its cabinet officers choose for their own staffs, according to reports. \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson was told that he couldn’t choose a deputy who had criticized the president . Robert Harward, Trump’s first choice for national security adviser, turned him down , reportedly because he would not have been allowed to install his own staff without approval from Trump’s advisers. \nEven for the staff already installed, infighting is leading the way. \nDeVos and Attorney General Jeff Sessions feuded over Trump’s impending decision to revoke protections for transgender students’ rights according to a New York Times report . Because Trump ultimately sided with Sessions, DeVos was forced to give in since Sessions could not proceed without her cooperation. \nTrump has filled less than three dozen of the 550 top Senate-confirmed positions, according to a report by Politico . The reasons for the rejections vary aside from the common theme that their appointments would seem to bruise the president’s ego. A candidate preferred by Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos was rejected due to previously working for an organization that had supported policies which Trump opposes. Meanwhile, Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin currently doesn’t have any undersecretaries or assistant secretaries, with his choices being turned down for having been insufficiently supportive of Trump in the past or being perceived as too liberal. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson couldn’t appoint Shermichael Singleton to a top position after it was discovered that Singleton had criticized Trump in the past. \nMatthew Rozsa is a breaking news writer for Salon.
