Artists from Muslim-majority countries deal with chaos from 'absurd' travel ban Read more \nThe joint letter, which was released by PEN America , stated that the consequences of the executive order are “entirely at odds with the national interests of the United States”. It went on to highlight the high profile artists who have already been affected by the order, which has a temporary restraining order against it after an injunction issued by a judge in Seattle was upheld by the ninth circuit court of appeals on 9 February. \nThe group used the examples of the Iranian director Asghar Farhadi , who is nominated for an Oscar for his film The Salesman but won’t be attending the ceremony. They also point to Syrian musician Omar Souleyman , who may not be able to perform at World Music Institute in New York, and the similarly uncertain fate of Palestinian-Syrian playwright Rama Haydar , who is also set to come to New York in 2017. \n“In the countries most affected by the immigration ban, it is writers, artists, musicians, and filmmakers who are often at the vanguard in the fights against oppression and terror,” it states. The group added that by stopping the travel of artists from the countries which are affected by the travel ban, Trump would “silence essential voices and exacerbate the hatreds that fuel global conflict”. ‘Brand new’: Trump considers revised immigration order \n“Closing our doors to writers, artists, musicians, and intellectuals not only fails to make America safer, but also creates a sort of cultural isolationism that will tear at our nation’s creative fabric,” added Suzanne Nossel, executive director of PEN America. \nDespite the backlash to the order, which caused travel chaos and was widely condemned for both the way it was rolled out and its basic premise, Trump said he is considering a brand new order that would probably change “ very little ” from the first. \nSpeaking in a press conference after the injunction was upheld, Trump said: “There are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen. We will continue to do things to make our country safe. We will not allow people into our country who are looking to do harm to our people.” \nThe letter comes after a similar statement from the American Library Association (ALA), which has surprisingly been at the vanguard of opposing the travel ban . “Our nation’s 120,000 public, academic, school and special libraries serve all community members, including people of color, immigrants, people with disabilities and the most vulnerable in our communities, offering services and educational resources that transform communities, open minds, and promote inclusion and diversity,” it said in a statement at the end of last month.
