Malaysian authorities say North Koreans put the deadly nerve agent VX on the hands of Aisyah and Huong, who then placed the toxin on Kim's face.\nMalaysia has not directly accused North Korea of having masterminded the killing but is pursuing several North Korean suspects, including a diplomat at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.\nNorth Korea has repeatedly criticised Malaysia's investigation and has not acknowledged the victim's identity.\nPolice last week identified the substance as the banned chemical weapon VX nerve agent , and Malaysia's health minister said on Sunday the dose was so high it caused \"very serious paralysis\" and killed him within 20 minutes.\nWATCH: Kim Jong-nam killing - Kuala Lumpur airport declared safe from VX nerve agent (2:09)\nSource: News agencies\nTell us what you think", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/Nfs_6UlkgTk"], "published": "2017-02-28T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:00:07.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
