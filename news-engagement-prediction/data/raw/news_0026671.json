(STEPHANIE KEITH/REUTERS) Updated: Wednesday, February 15, 2017, 12:23 AM \nQuite a rally for Rumor — a commanding comeback for German shepherds, too. \nRumor was crowned America's top dog Tuesday night when, a year after a near miss, she came out of retirement to win best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club. \nCheered loudly all around the ring by a packed crowd at Madison Square Garden, and clearly the crowd favorite, she's just the second German shepherd to win the event that began in 1877. \n\"Unbelievable,\" handler and co-owner Kent Boyles said. \nWestminster Kennel Club Dog Show buzz for dog named Rumor \nIn a year that's seen lots of late, startling twists in sports — think Patriots, Cubs and Cavaliers — Rumor pulled a shocker. She'd been at home in Wisconsin for months, a house pet headed toward having puppies, when she suddenly jumped back into the show ring in January. Meet the three breeds debuting at the 2017 Westminster Dog Show \nBoyles is a fan of the Green Bay Packers and star quarterback Aaron Rodgers. Seeing a pet go from the couch to this top prize, heck, that's a dog world Hail Mary. \nRumor beat out a Norwegian elkhound, a Pekingese, a miniature poodle, an Irish setter, a boxer and a Norwich terrier in the final ring. The Irish setter called Adrian finished second. \n\"The German shepherd standard talks about quality and nobility,\" judge Thomas Bradley III said. \"When you recognize it, it hits you at home, and that's what it really is. She is just magnificent.\" \nThe 5-year-old Rumor is named for the Adele hit song \"Rumor Has It.\" This was the 104th career win for Rumor, and earlier in the day, Boyles said that this would definitely, for real, be her last major show.

CLARY/AFP/Getty Images) \n\"She's going to be relaxing for a while,\" Boyles said after the win, but ultimately, there are \"puppies in her future.\" \nRumor joined the fittingly named Manhattan in 1987 as the only German shepherds to go best in show at the Garden. \nThere were nearly 2,800 dogs entered in the 141st Westminster canine competition, spread across the 202 eligible breeds and varieties.
