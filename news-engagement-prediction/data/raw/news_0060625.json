Image copyright Facebook Image caption The family said on Facebook in \"getting Steve home then we have truly found him again\" \nThe family said on Facebook: \"The 'not knowing' hurts but not as much as the thoughts that your imagination conjures in the dark hours whilst also having to try and quench the flames of 'what ifs', rumours and gossip that becomes accepted as fact. \n\"Knowing that Steve is now coming home is an end to all of that and the fog can lift at last.\" \nThe statement added that he brought \"laughter, love and happiness\" and \"shone amongst us\" and that \"sadly we will be bringing him home to say our farewells\". \nOn arrival in the UK Mr Cook's remains will be sent to the coroner in Cheshire. \nDet Insp Gary McIntyre said the family was \"very appreciative\" of all the support the media and the public had given them over the years, and asked that their privacy be respected at this difficult time.
