P.J. Thompson missed an open 3-pointer. \nBoooo . \nIsaac Haas grabbed the offensive rebound and passed it to Dakota Mathias. \nB . \nMathias found Vince Edwards – alone, of course – for another 3-pointer. Purdue could have done this all day, shooting 3-pointers and missing and grabbing the rebound while Davis was clutching at his battered face 90 feet away, but Edwards sank the 3-pointer for a 44-42 Purdue lead and …. \nB !

(Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar) \nThe Indiana Daily Student had thoughtfully left copies throughout the arena of its special-section spirit page – game advance and photos on one side, BOILER DOWN in giant print on the other – and now those copies were descending from the upper deck in crumpled-up balls of anger. None of the trash made it to the floor. \nWell, the referees were down there. \nBut that’s another story. And it’s not the story of this game, this 69-64 victory for Purdue that may well have been the death knell of Indiana’s NCAA tournament hopes. As bad as the referees were – they were terrible – there was more to this game than them. But while we’re on the topic … \nReferees Lamont Simpson, Paul Szelc and Pat Driscoll – they’ve earned their spot in the newspaper – managed to foul out the best big man on both teams in the final minute. On the same play . Buy Photo \nA blarge? A double foul was call on Hoosiers center Thomas Bryant (31) and Purdue forward Caleb Swanigan (50) on this play in the second half of their game Thursday at Assembly Hall. (Photo: Matt Kryger/IndyStar) \nTrailing 64-59 with 44.5 seconds left, Indiana’s Thomas Bryant collided with Purdue’s Caleb Swanigan as he was scoring at the rim. One referee – don’t know his name; let’s call him Tweedledee – was signaling a blocking foul on Swanigan as another ref (Tweedledum?) was standing in front of IU coach Tom Crean with one hand on the back of his head, signaling an offensive foul and Bryant’s number 31. After much discussion, the referees decided this coin-flip of a call landed on neither heads nor tails. They called both, taking away Bryant’s basket and assessing a double-foul copout call that was the fifth and final foul for both big men. \nLike I said: The court wasn’t completely clear of garbage. \nAnd Indiana fans were angry. They were their angriest earlier in the game, when the 7-2, 290-pound Haas raked his right arm across the nose of Davis and sent the 6-10, 240-pound IU freshman crumbling to the floor. After Purdue’s 15-second possession ended in three points, officials called timeout to allow IU to check on Davis while the student section took umbrage with their visitors from West Lafayette. It started in the rowdiest part of the student section, the bleachers behind the basket near Purdue’s bench, but spread all over the arena: \n(Expletive) Purdue! (Expletive) Purdue! x Share James Blackmon Jr. and Thomas Bryant meet the media after Indiana falls to Purdue 69-64. Zach Osterman/IndyStar \nAssembly Hall public address announcer Chuck Crabb very calmly reminded the crowd that “profanity can result in a technical foul,” and the crowd went back to wordless booing. \nThis game was emotional – always has been, always will be – but Indiana’s fading NCAA tournament hopes already had some of the IU fan base on edge even before tipoff. Anger is mounting in Bloomington, as it always does when the season isn’t great and the coach isn’t Bob Knight, and it will only grow upon reflection of the Hoosiers’ fourth loss in their last five home games with Purdue. \nAttrition isn’t an excuse anyone wants to hear, and it wasn’t one Crean wanted to give on a night his frontcourt began without Collin Hartman (knee) and OG Anunoby (knee) and ended without Davis (face), Juwan Morgan (fouled out) and Bryant (fouled out). In the final 45 seconds Indiana was playing Freddie McSwain at center and 6-6 walk-on Zach McRoberts at power forward. \nEven Purdue coach Matt Painter was feeling badly for the Hoosiers, noting that “now when (the Hoosiers) get into foul trouble, it’s not normal foul trouble … you have to keep that in perspective if you’re an IU fan.” \nWhat’s the fun in that? And to be clear, Indiana’s offense had stalled before its attrition reached critical mass. Its only reliable scoring option was Bryant (23 points on 8-of-12 shooting, including 3-of-4 on 3-pointers), with the rest of the team shooting 31.1 percent from the floor (14-for-45) and 25 percent on 3-pointers (5-for-20). In the second half the Hoosiers were missing two of every three shots (9-for-26). CLOSE x Share The Boilermakers coach on his team's third straight victory and third on the road in the past two weeks. Nathan Baird / Journal & Courier \nPurdue, meanwhile, was getting 26 points from Vincent Edwards and 13 from fearless freshman Carsen Edwards, while Biggie Swanigan was offering up his usual double-double: 16 points, 14 rebounds. \nEven with James Blackmon (knee) back after missing three games, Indiana was outmanned from the outset. Which is why the Hoosiers will surely find themselves on the wrong side of the next wave of NCAA tournament projections, and will remain there unless they win four or maybe five of their final six regular-season games. And given the quality and/or location of all six opponents, and given the amount of oil the Hoosiers have been leaking of late – four losses in their last five games – a 4-2 finish seems unlikely. \nWhich means the even more unlikely could be upon us: A basketball school as potent as IU, with nonconference wins against a pair of teams ranked in the top three at the time (Kansas and North Carolina), is probably going to miss the NCAA tournament. \nAnd IU fans thought they were mad Thursday night? Their anger is only going to grow. And their next fusillade of fury won’t be aimed at officials or the other team. \nFind IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter at @GreggDoyelStar or at www.facebook.com/gregg.doyel Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
