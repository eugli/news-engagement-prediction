We chose to carry full term and let nature take its course. It was an impossible decision. I feel we made the right choice. Oliver heard us tell him how much we loved him. \n\"All he ever knew was love. He fell to sleep peacefully. \n\"He was beautiful and we got to spend so much time with him, using the cold blanket that was provided. He lived for one hour and surprised all the staff. We never want his memory to be forgotten.\" \nThe 23-year-old has since been on a mission to raise money for the bereavement suite at the QEQM Hospital in Margate after her son's death on March 30, 2016. \nSo far, Jessica has raised around £1,300 and is expecting that figure to rise significantly at the next event. \nJessica added: \"Evolve Salon & Wellness Spa, where I work, have been so helpful and raised a lot of money for the bereavement suite as well – we will have a big cheque being donated on the day. Mum Jessica is now raising money for her local hospital (Photo: Kent Live) \n\"We have also purchased and donated a camera which will be used to take photos of babies and families from labour to dressing and cuddling their still born or shortly lived child.\" \nThe couple said they plan to try and have kids again in the future and Jessica wants to raise awareness so other parents feel they can talk about children they've lost. \nShe said: \"No parent should ever have to go through this unimaginable heartache. When I had Oliver, I was right next to the labour ward and could see and hear babies being born – it was traumatic.\" \nJessica also runs the Facebook group 'Potter's Syndrome Awareness in memory of Oliver Michael Mark Young' where she said she has been contacted by \"so many parents\" who have felt comforted by the group.
