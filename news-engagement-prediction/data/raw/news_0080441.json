The boy with the infectious smile and gentle heart immediately won over Joe and Gloria Curotte, the foster parents who loved and bonded with the child they would come to consider a son.\n“He had the biggest grin,” his mother, Gloria, said, remembering that first day.\n“This little boy is not going to give us a hard time, look how happy he is.”\nFor the next 25 years, Gregoire was a source of enormous joy and pride, as well as pain, as his struggle with addiction and his desire to wander took him away from that house, to Labrador and Montreal and finally to Toronto.\n  “Pierre never left us. In my mind, at least, he thought of us every night,” Gloria said, speaking to the Star from their home on the Kahnawake reserve south of Montreal.\nPierre Gregoire died Feb. 15 after overdosing in downtown Toronto. Months earlier, he was interviewed in a video, pictured here, about life on the streets and his love for his family. ( My Little Hobby / YouTube ) Joe Curotte, centre, fostered nine children, including Pierre Gregoire, left, Iohseri:io, in red, Lisa (Watshennon:ni) and Iohahi:io, over a decade. They are pictured here, in a photo Gloria took, in their backyard. ( Family photo ) As kids, Pierre Gregoire, right, and his siblings — from left, Iohseri:io and Lisa (Watshennon:ni) — never fought for long, their parents said. They loved each other and always said goodnight. ( Family photo ) Pierre Gregoire, right, arrived at his home on the Kahnawake reserve, in Quebec, at the age of 3 1/2. This picture, with his sister Iohseri:io, was taken on his first day of kindergarten. ( Family photo ) As a young boy, Pierre Gregoire loved to ride dirt bikes, often bringing them home in pieces for his father to fix. ( Family photo ) Pierre Gregoire was the foster son of Joe and Gloria Curotte, who raised him and many other children in their home on the Kahnawake reserve, in Quebec. ( Family photo ) In a video made shortly before his death, Pierre Gregoire remembered how his foster parents were \"amazing\" and loved him \"with all their hearts\" and of how they'd tried to show him the world — like on this trip to Universal Studios in Orlando, Fla. ( Family photo ) “Pierre was our boy. Pierre belonged here with us.”\nGregoire died on Feb. 15, in a bathroom at a KFC in Toronto, shortly after injecting heroin police suspect contained fentanyl. The powerful drug is linked to a rising number of deaths among intravenous drug users across the country.\nHe was 28.\nHis story, but not his name, was published amid what activists and allies have identified as an ongoing crisis of shelter capacity and addiction services in Toronto. He was said to have walked away from a downtown drop-in centre, where he was fed by welcoming staff, but told it was too full to allow him to lie down and sleep.\nOn Wednesday morning, a memorial service was held at West Neighbourhood House, a drop-in centre and community hub at the corner of Queen and Bathurst Sts. Nearly 50 people gathered in a circle of burgundy-cushioned chairs under large feathered dream catchers hanging overhead.\nA worker handed out printed programs with Gregoire’s beaming face. One man, who arrived early, pressed it to his lips.\nElder Vern Harper asked everyone to come forward as he explained the importance of the circle, a place where they were all invited to step in, to heal and to honour Gregoire.\nHarper started with a prayer, everyone rising to their feet, the final words echoing around the circle in murmured response.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T17:14:50.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
