By Feb 22nd, 2017 549 \nOn 21 February 2017, the Facebook page “VoteVets.org” published a photograph of a letter purportedly announcing reductions to childcare services on one military base (along with reports of other such closures): \nMilitary.com published an article on 21 February 2017 reporting the suspension of some childcare programs at two Army bases due to a civilian hiring freeze: \nA federal civilian hiring freeze ordered by President Donald Trump has forced at least two Army bases to indefinitely suspend some child care programs. \nOfficials at Fort Knox, Kentucky, notified families Feb. 17 of the suspension to the on-base part-day child development center (CDC) programs, its hourly care program and the enrollment of new families into the CDC. \n“Effective immediately, no new children will be enrolled in the CDC,” states the letter, signed by Fort Knox garrison commander Col. Stephen Aiton. “Also, effective 27 February 2017, the CDC will no longer accommodate childcare for our hourly care and part day families until further notice.” \nThe CDC’s part-day programs include its part-day preschools. Many military families, including some CDC workers, rely on hourly care for child care during part-time jobs or school hours, or when the full-time day care program is full. One Army spouse at Fort Knox reported that the wait list for her 1-year-old is estimated through July [2017]. \n“We are prevented from bringing new caregivers on board but are still having our usual staff turnover and illnesses, which creates challenges to maintaining ratios and providing quality childcare,” the Fort Knox letter states. \nThe New York Times reported on the 23 January 2017 memorandum issued by President Trump that implemented a federal hiring freeze: \nPresident Trump [has] ordered an across-the-board employment freeze for the federal government, halting hiring for all new and existing positions except those in national security, public safety and the military. \nIn the two-page order, Mr. Trump said the directive was a stopgap way to control the growth of government until his budget director recommends a long-term plan to significantly reduce the federal work force through attrition. \n“In carrying out this memorandum, I ask that you seek efficient use of existing personnel and funds to improve public services and the delivery of these services,” Mr. Trump wrote in the memorandum, one of his first acts as president. “Accordingly, this memorandum does not prohibit making reallocations to meet the highest priority needs and to ensure that essential services are not interrupted and national security is not affected.” \nThe hiring freeze’s effect on military childcare specifically wasn’t immediately apparent: \nIMCOM [Army Installation Management Command] officials said they are unaware of any other bases suspending their hourly or part-day programs as a result of the hiring freeze. \nOfficials with the Navy said although the service requires a similar approval process for hiring exemptions, they are unaware of any CDC programs being shuttered as a result. \nMarine Corps and Air Force officials did not respond by deadline to requests for comment. \nHowever, Military.com noted that on-base childcare “historically had problems keeping positions filled due to high turnover and a sluggish background check system through which all workers must be vetted.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T10:00:59.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
