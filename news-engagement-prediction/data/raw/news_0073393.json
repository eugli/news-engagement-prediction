The finishing touch? A co-ordinating pair of sky-high satin platforms by Stuart Weitzman. \nBut once the Fences actress had given her emotional acceptance speech, she soon changed into a more comfortable pair of platform trainers. And who can blame her? \nDavis's stylist, Elizabeth Stewart, posted an photo from backstage at the awards which showed the Weitzman heels being swapped for an equally sassy, but more comfortable, pair of trainer-platforms by Los Angeles-based shoe brand, Y R U. It's a move which women the world over will relate to.

In her acceptance speech, she paid tribute to August Wilson, the playwright who originally wrote Fences .

And I say, exhume those bodies, exhume those stories, the stories of the people who dreamed... I became an artist, and thank god I did, because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life. So here’s to August Wilson, who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.” \nM eanwhile, Stewart spoke earlier this week of Davis's no-nonsense approach to her red carpet style. “The interest in what Viola’s wearing is way greater than the attention she pays to it,” she told Vanity Fair . And while many Hollywood actresses expend serious time and energy poring over outfit possibilities and collaborating on the style they will present to the world, Davis appears to be impressively efficient about the process. “I would say I’m like the dentist to her,” Stewart added, explaining that fittings with Davis were usually over within five minutes.

The trainer-swap is a refreshing move from Davis in a world where \"no pain, no gain\" is the usual mantra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:28:32.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
