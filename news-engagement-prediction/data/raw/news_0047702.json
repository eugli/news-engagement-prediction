(Dallas County Jail) \nA Dallas jury sentenced a neurosurgeon dubbed “Dr. Death” by local media to life in prison on Monday, over his role in a botched back surgery that left his elderly patient crippled and in constant pain. Christopher Duntsch, 46, was arrested in July 2015 on five aggravated-assault charges after four of his patients were left crippled and two others died between July 2012 and June 2013, Dallas News reported. \nHis trial focused on only one charge of injury to an elderly individual, with victim Mary Efurd testifying that she had trusted Duntsch to perform the 2012 procedure. Efurd, who was then 74, lost a third of her blood and the full use of her legs, Dallas News reported. \n“I trusted that he would do what was right,” Efurd said, according to the report. \nThe 13-day trial included testimony from a doctor who treated Efurd after Duntsch’s procedure and said he found implants placed on muscle instead of bone, and a screw drilled into her spinal cavity. \n“It’s as egregious as you can imagine,” Dr. Robert Henderson said, according to Dallas News. \nJurors heard from other patients, including one who woke from surgery paralyzed from the neck down, another who passes out from chronic pain and a third who talks in a permanent whisper after she was left with a puncture wound in her throat.
