The chase for Paul George is on. \nThe Celtics are in talks with the Indiana Pacers involving their All-Star forward, Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports’“The Vertical” reported ahead of Thursday’s NBA trade deadline, citing sources. \nPer Wojnarowski, the Celtics didn’t include their rights to the Brooklyn Nets’ 2017 first-round pick in their initial offer to Indiana. Sources: Boston, Indy had preliminary talk on Paul George, but there won't be real dialogue until/unless C's introduce Nets pick into deal. \n— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 23, 2017 \nBut Boston had a quick change of heart, Wojnarowski reports, and the two teams now are trying to hash things out. Update on Boston, Indy: Boston hasn't met Indiana's asking price on Paul George, but Nets pick has entered conversation now, sources say. \n— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 23, 2017 \nGeorge has been tied to all sorts of rumors in recent days. Some have suggested he’ll go to the Celtics and others have insinuated he’s interested in the Lakers , while there’s a third camp that believes he’s staying in Indiana . \nThe 26-year-old forward is one of Boston’s primary trade targets, though, so this certainly is intriguing news for C’s fans. \nThumbnail photo via Brian Spurlock/USA TODAY Sports Images \nHave a question for Darren Hartwell?
