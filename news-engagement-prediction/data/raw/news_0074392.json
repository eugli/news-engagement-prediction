Coke Really Does Taste Better At McDonald's And This Is Why Instagram | @mcdonalds \nI have a thing for fountain soda — I love it! I prefer fountain soda over bottled or canned any day, but when it comes to drinks from the fountain machine, I have to say that McDonald's is my favorite. I have been saying for years now that McDonald's has the best fountain soda. My family looks at me like I am crazy, but wait till I show them this! I am not alone in my feelings for McDonald's fountain soda. I thought that maybe it was just a matter of me really liking fountain soda, but now I know that there are others out there who share my love of McDonald's Coke. Advertisement Something really is different when you go to McDonald's and order a Coca-Cola. This brown, bubbly beverage is so refreshing at McDonald's and there is a reason why. Express For starters, most fast food restaurants have their Coca-Cola delivered in bags. McDonald's chooses to have theirs delivered in stainless steel containers. This helps to keep the Coca-Cola fresh, and it preserves the ingredients. Advertisement Water plays an important role in a fountain drink. 85% of a fountain drink is water , so if the water is terrible, you are most definitely going to notice. McDonald's is meticulous about their water, and each location has a reverse osmosis filter which provides the best water possible. This is the #1 reason why their Coke tastes the best — they have the cleanest water you can get. Instagram | @mcdonalds What do you think about McDonald's fountain soda?
