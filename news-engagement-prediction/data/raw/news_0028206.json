On Monday night’s episode of The Project , the panel — including himself, Carrie Bickmore and Gretel Killeen — joked about a story whereby a Perth business posted a job advertisement on Gumtree that specified no “bogans” or “rough people” need apply. \nBut Aly’s humour was off target. “The other thing — if you are not taking bogans, where will you get good admin people?” he quipped. \nThe jarring line elicited an “Ooh” from the studio audience before Bickmore quickly moved on to the next news headline. \nSpeaking on Triple M’s The Grill Team on Tuesday morning, former rugby league star Mark Geyer lashed Waleed for his glaring insensitivity. \nGeyer played a large chunk of his career at Penrith in Sydney’s west, and now lives even further west in Mt Druitt, and was furious Aly would make fun of people who might be less privileged than himself. Geyer is proud of his roots. Source: News Corp Australia Aly is one of Australia’s most recognisable on-air talents. Source: News Corp Australia \n“That’s funny, real funny Waleed,” Geyer said sarcastically. “He thinks it is (funny), he’s the Gold Logie winner don’t you forget. That’s as funny as cancer in my opinion. \n“It’s bulls***, you shouldn’t be making fun of people who are less educated than you. That’s what he’s doing, that’s simply what he’s doing. It’s elitism. \n“Come on man, he’s better than that. You should be better than that. \n“He’s the one banging on, every night on the show he seems to be preaching to us about equality and stuff and all of a sudden he’s bagging the minority. Don’t do it mate, don’t do it. \n“I grew up being called a ‘westie’ and while I celebrate where I come from, it’s still a put-down. \n“This is a bloke in an authority position on TV, he got the Gold Logie, and he’s making a disparaging comment about people who come from where I come from, and I don’t like it.” \n“You want to say anything to the bogans of Australia?” she teased him. \nAly was quick to back-pedal. \n“Should I clarify? In my head I was making the opposite point to what came out, the idea that admin people are bogans is ridiculous, but it came out the wrong way around,” he said. \nBut Gretel Killeen pulled him up. \n“You’re a boganist,” she jokingly accused. \n“No, I’m a bogan,” Aly concluded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:14:30.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
