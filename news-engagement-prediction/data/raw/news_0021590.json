And “unless there’s some real cause to do it,” he doesn’t plan on investigating. \nBlitzer specifically pressed him on the issue of Trump’s tax returns, and Chaffetz said he wouldn’t want to “overuse” his power by subpoenaing those returns. He personally believes that Trump should disclose those documents, but told Blitzer he’s not going to subpoena them just to see if there’s anything in there: \n“If somebody has not violated the law and there’s no evidence that they’re violating the law, do you really think that it’s appropriate for me to just go on a fishing expedition and look at tax returns? There’s very strict rules on that.” \nHe said that one branch of government doing that to the head of another branch wouldn’t be appropriate. Blitzer took a moment in response to say this: \n“Your committee is designed to be a sort of a check and a balance on the executive branch. The Oversight Committee, that’s what it’s called. You have to look, potentially, at a whole bunch of issues that are sometimes awkward.” \nWatch the video above, via CNN. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:36:52.542+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
