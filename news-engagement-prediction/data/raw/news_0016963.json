Picture: KTVU\nThis superhuman feat prompted the station’s 2 Investigates program to take a closer look at just what Mr Zhang was up to during these marathon-length work days.\nWhat they say they found raised “serious questions” about the municipal transport authority’s oversight of its employee timesheets.\nInvestigative reporters examined two random days of surveillance video from the station’s security cameras, and discovered a mysterious storage closet in which Mr Zhang appeared to have disappeared for “hours at a time”.\nmedia_camera Mr Zhang “never refused an overtime shift”, his bosses said.
