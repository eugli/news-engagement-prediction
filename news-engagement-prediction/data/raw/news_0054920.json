This allows it to navigate without supervision, and park itself in a safe spot once stopped. \nIt follows its owner thanks to an electric belt, but can also navigate limited distances on its own. This means you could, in theory, send Gita out by itself within a pre-mapped area to transport something. \nIf it sounds like Gita is a prime target for next-generation purse-snatchers, Piaggio has that covered too. It’s equipped with a fingerprint scanner and a code lock, as well as the aforementioned cameras. \nPiaggio Fast Forward (PFF), a startup within the company, created Gita to allow humans to move more comfortably. “Think about how much more freely you would be able to move from one point to another if lugging cumbersome items was removed from the equation,” said PFF CEO Jeffrey Schnapp. \nGita will be available on a business-to-business basis in the near future.
