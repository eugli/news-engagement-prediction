Over the past week, the sluggish low has been delivering incessant rain across the base of the Gulf, with 200-300mm of rainfall. On the 24h to Sunday 9am, Borroloola picked 183mm of rain making it its wettest February day in 18 years worth of records. Cloud and rain also capped daytime temperatures to 24 degrees, Borroloola's coolest February day also since records began.Furthermore, squally storms and strong winds have also been battering the southern Gulf coast. This morning, Centre Island recorded gusts of up to 113km/h.The low will continue to linger over the coming days, likely delivering a further 200-400mm in the coming week to the base of the Gulf of Carpentaria. Tropical cyclone Alfred is only the second tropical cyclone to be named this season across the Australian region, with no land crossings so far. Note tropical cyclone Yvette was downgraded to a low before it made landfall later last December. The latest system to cross the Australian coast is tropical cyclone Charlie , crossing the coast on the 29th of February 1988.Last season saw the quietest season on record with only three tropical cyclone within the region and only one crossing. Although this season has seen a continuation of last year pattern so far, the season will continue until the end of April urging anyone living or traveling to northern Australia not to fall complacent. - Weatherzone", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:26:12.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
