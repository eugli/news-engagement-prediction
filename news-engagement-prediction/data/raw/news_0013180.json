The 3-year-old, who already has numeral fan clubs, has been stealing hearts and attention with his cute childish antics. The charming little boy has often stolen the limelight from his superstar dad when he accompanied him to his film sets. Of late, the father-son duo has practically been joined at the hip during their short trips around the country and abroad. When we asked daddy SRK if he considered tagging AbRam along for his #RaeesByRail promotion tour, he said, \"I don't know how inconvenient it would be, but I would have loved to take AbRam with me. He is full of fun. He was with me in Dubai and he enjoyed it. He doesn't trouble me and everybody is kind to him including the media. He is used to paparazzi and used to being with my team and me. He has gotten used to people around me. He travelled with me to Imtiaz Ali's set. He waves to the media. Last night I took a flight from Dubai and people wanted to take pictures with me. He wanted to be a part of every picture.\" ‘Raees’ hits theatres tomorrow, January 25, 2017.
