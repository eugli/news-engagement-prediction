Marty Harbin, R-Tyrone , was signed by about half of the chamber’s GOP majority.\nIn one short sentence, it says that Georgia should apply in similar fashion the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Formally approved 1993, the law requires the government to prove a “compelling governmental interest” before it interferes with a person’s exercise of religion.\nRepublicans in the Senate, however, have for at least the last two years backed “religious liberty” legislation to prevent discrimination against faith-based organizations including those opposed to same-sex marriage. Opponents to such measures say that history concerns them.\nGov. Nathan Deal vetoed a much broader “religious liberty” measure last year , saying it would damage the state’s reputation of tolerance and inclusion.", "external_links": ["http://legislativenavigator.myajc.com/#members/850"], "published": "2017-02-22T00:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:13:13.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
