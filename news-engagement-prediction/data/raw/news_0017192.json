Ad Feedback \nShe was then picked up by the West Coast Rescue Helicopter and flown to Grey Base Hospital in Greymouth. \n\"[Crooks] wants to express her gratitude to the tramper who found her, and everyone involved in the search and rescue efforts to try and locate her,\" Blooms aid. \nPolice thanked everyone who helped in their efforts to find Crooks over the last six weeks. \n\"We are ecstatic this had had a positive outcome.\" \nSpeaking from his Opotiki home earlier on Monday, Crooks' father John said the family were leaving for the West Coast. \n\"We are in a really good space at the moment; we are really grateful for everything really. \n\"At this stage we don't know anything more than we knew last time apart from she's been found and we are just all grateful for it.\" \nThe last six weeks had been \"terrible\". \n\"Just getting sightings everywhere sort of put us off the track of where she was.\" \nCrooks has four children – 5-year-old twins, an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old. The children live with other family members. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:34:14.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
