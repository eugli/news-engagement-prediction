You can hear him from anywhere and it’s like he has certainly got his mojo back. \n“He’ll be in for a big one.” \nIndigenous All Stars coach Laurie Daley says if looks are anything to go by, Fifita is in for a big season. \n“I don’t think there is any issue with Andrew,” Daley said. \n“He actually looks in really good shape. I think he has lost a lot of weight and trained really hard in the off-season and if that’s an indicator, I think he will have a big year. \n“He seems to be as good as gold and I think he’ll have a big game tomorrow [Friday] night. I think he is pretty keen to get out there and play well against a big All Stars team.” \nFifita came under fire last August after The Daily Telegraph revealed he had written the initials F. K. L (For Kieran Loveridge) on his wrist bands in at least seven NRL games. \nLoveridge, a childhood friend, is serving a 10 year jail term for the one-punch attack that led to Thomas Kelly’s death in 2012. \nFifita was hit in the hip pocket in late December by the NRL after an Integrity Unit investigation dragged on for almost four months and prior to that, was denied the chance to earn $50,000 from playing in the Four Nations tournament after being ruled ineligible.

It’s a fantastic team. The guys are excited to go out there and throw the ball around and I think you will see an open, entertaining game. \n“It’s obviously different to State of Origin and different to club footy but it’s great that all the boys can get a feel for one another and they go out there and just play. I’m really excited about some of the younger boys. \n“It’s good the boys all want to play in it.” \nWorld All Stars coach Mal Meninga said his side has a big part to play. \n“The game is the culmination of a celebration of Indigenous participation in our sport so it’s an enjoyable time. It’s a fun time, there is a lot of freedom around how we want to play so they will just go out there and do their best and entertain the crowd.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
