Photo: Eddy Chen/ABC On Sunday night, La La Land won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Then, the award went to Moonlight . In an excruciating debacle that played out on live TV, and has since been picked apart online , Warren Beatty was given Emma Stone’s Best Actress envelope, which he handed off to his co-presenter Faye Dunaway, who announced the award. As the La La Land team started to give their speeches, stagehands rushed onstage, telling them the shocking news that Moonlight had, in fact, won instead. It’s not entirely clear how such a simple moment went so wrong, but comments from the presenters, PricewaterhouseCoopers (the accounting firm that tallies the votes), and others involved in the ceremony have revealed a little of what happened behind the scenes. Here’s everything we know.\nThe accountants prep two envelopes for each award. \nThere were two PwC partners, Martha Ruiz and Brian Cullinan , responsible for tallying the votes in advance of Oscar night. They carry two identical sets of envelopes in two briefcases, passing envelopes from either side of the stage.\nLeonardo DiCaprio presented one Best Actress envelope to Emma Stone. \nDespite rumors that DiCaprio may have passed Stone’s envelope back to one of the presenters and triggered the chaos, Stone insisted that she had hers on hand during the whole show . “I don’t mean to start stuff,” Stone said, “but whatever story that was — I had that card.”\nInstead of getting a Best Picture envelope, Beatty was given the other Best Actress envelope. \nAs Beatty came up to present, you could see the gold writing on his red envelope reads “Actress in a Leading Role.” Why was he given the wrong card? This morning, PwC took the blame in a statement, writing, “The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.” If you’re looking for a specific culprit: The New York Times points out that Dunaway and Beatty emerged from Cullinan’s side of the stage, meaning that he “clearly handed Mr. Beatty the wrong envelope.” The Wall Street Journal also notes that Cullinan tweeted a photo of Best Actress winner Emma Stone three minutes before Beatty and Dunaway took the stage.\n(The Times , fascinatingly, adds that PwC used different envelopes this year, going from red lettering on a gold background to gold lettering on red, which is potentially harder to read. The Academy was responsible for the design changes.)\nBeatty knew something was amiss when he opened the envelope, but he wasn’t sure what. \nOnstage, Beatty vamped, checked for a second card, and then passed the card to Dunaway, as if to check to see if she had a second opinion. Dunaway saw La La Land listed under Emma Stone’s name and announced it as the Best Picture winner. A microphone picked up Beatty saying, “But it says Emma Stone” as the camera cut away and the audience started to cheer.\nAfterward, Beatty acknowledged that he was unsure of what to make of the card in the moment. “I read the card that was in the envelope,” he said, according to People . “I read it but I didn’t say La La Land . I thought, ‘This is very strange because it says Best Actress on the card.’ And I felt that maybe there was some sort of misprint … As planned, I gave it to Faye, and that’s all I want to say on the subject.”\nAfter the La La Land team took the stage, the crew realized the mistake and had to stop their speeches. \nThe PwC accountants first realized the wrong winner had been announced, according to the New York Times , and alerted the rest of the crew. The crew rushed to find the correct Moonlight Best Picture envelope, and also asked La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz to open the one he had just been given, which read “Emma Stone, La La Land .” After Horowitz came to the mic to tell Moonlight that they have won, a man in a headset passes the correct envelope to Beatty, who passes it to Horowitz, who brandishes it in front of the camera.\nAs Moonlight took the stage, Beatty apologized for his mistake. \n“I want to tell you what happened. I opened the envelope and it said ‘Emma Stone, La La Land .’ That’s why I took such a long look at Faye and at you,” he said onscreen, gesturing toward the audience. “I wasn’t trying to be funny.”\nAfter the speeches, Beatty made an effort to find Moonlight director Barry Jenkins and show him both the Best Picture and Best Actress cards. “Warren refused to show the card to anybody before he showed it to me,” Jenkins said . “And so he did. He came upstairs and he walked over to me, and he showed the card. And everybody was asking, ‘Can I see the card’? And he’s like, ‘No, Barry Jenkins has to see the card, I need him to know.’ And he showed it to me. I felt better about what happened.” Jenkins also tweeted a photo of the correct Best Picture card .\nDunaway isn’t saying anything. \nShe told The Hollywood Reporter that she wouldn’t comment on the matter. Per Vanity Fair , she, “seemingly unfazed, was snacking on cashews backstage in the first moments after the Best Picture announcement.”\nTags: top story vulture homepage lede oscars 2017 envelopes warren beatty la la land moonlight movies tv More Everything We Know About That Oscars Best Picture Mix-up   New   What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO The   ‘Defamed’   12  \n12  \n9:46 a.m. Steve Harvey Offers His Help to Warren Beatty After Oscars Picture Mix-up “I can help you get through this!”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T23:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:10:43.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
