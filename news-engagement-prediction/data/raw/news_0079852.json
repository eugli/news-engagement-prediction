It was a matter of meters‚” he said. \nER24 spokesperson Russell Meiring said that paramedics attending the scene were led to the body of a man outside a shop. \nIt was later established that the shop is Sewraj Jewellers. \n“Paramedics were led into a shop‚ where they found the body of a man‚ believed to be one of the suspects‚ lying behind one of the counters.” \nThe man had sustained numerous gunshot wounds and was in a critical condition. \n“Paramedics treated the man and initiated advanced life support interventions. Unfortunately after approximately 20 minutes the man succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead on the scene.” \n- TMG Digital/The Times Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
