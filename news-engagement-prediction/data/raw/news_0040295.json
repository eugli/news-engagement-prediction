Hearing ancestral voices \nThe original soundtracks were recorded in the 1960s, and feature voices of elders past and present. \nLoretta 'Lulu' Durretmuthi who has been working with elders to translate the Kayardild to English, was able to hear sound recordings that featured her great-grandfather. \n\"It almost brought a tear to my eyes listening to him speaking because the last I remember him was when I was about 10 or 11 years old,\" she said. \n\"I can understand what they're saying, but I can't really speak it. \n\"If I'm going, I'll tell you ngada warraj [and] if I tell you to come, I say dalij, and if I wanted you to sit down I tell you to diij.\" \nMs Durretmuthi said the transfer of the Kaiadilt people to Mornington Island, where the project is currently being run, is the reason behind the language's threatened status. \n\"Everyone was just, more or less, forced to speak English, I suppose,\" she said. \n\"My mum said even when they were put in the dormitories, the missionaries told them they weren't allowed to speak their language and that's how come it sort of got lost. \n\"Out of the old girls, there's about five of them, and there's only one of them that's actually very fluent on it.\" Photo: Dr Evans has been working with large groups of Kaiadilt people to build the grammar. (Supplied: Grace Barnes) Writing a grammar for unique language \nDr Evans became involved with the Kayardild language in the early 1980s when he began his PhD and became aware of the language's vulnerability. \n\"At that point, there would've been about 40 people that still spoke the language, [and] from that time on, no child was born that would grow up speaking the language,\" he said. \nHe began to write the grammar of Kayardild in a final push to preserve a dying art. \n\"My job was to write a grammar of the language which basically describes how a language works,\" Dr Evans said. \n\"I was very, very lucky because it's a very unusual language that does lots of things that no other language in the world does.\" \nUsing the grammar written by Dr Evans, app designer Ben Foley has separated individual words spoken by elders, and integrated these in a form of dictionary. \n\"What we can now do, also thanks to technology, is to go through these recordings, snip out a recording, and then that gets associated with the word on the app when you display it,\" Dr Evans said. Audio: Linguist Professor Nicholas Evans spoke to Zara Margolis about the program. (ABC News) \nHe said while a lot had been lost in terms of Indigenous Australian languages, technology could help us savour the knowledge that still existed. \n\"We can't turn back the clock, and we can't bring people back to life who've left this earth, but through this process — going back over recordings that have been made — people hear voices and we can break it up,\" Dr Evans said. Indigenous languages under threat \nThe Kayardild language is not the only Australian Indigenous language in peril. \nDr Doug Marmion, a researh fellow in linguistics at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) said overall, Indigenous Australian languages were in decline. \n\"In 2004, AIATSIS conducted a survey, which we called the National Indigenous Language Survey (NILS), and we looked at the state of Indigenous languages across the whole continent,\" he said. \n\"We believe that there were at least around 250 languages across Australia. \n\"In 2004, the evidence was that around 145 still had speakers and of those, only 18 were strong — and by 'strong' we mean they were being passed onto children who were using their languages as a matter of course on a daily basis.\" \nA decade later AIATSIS conducted a second language survey to measure further vulnerability. \n\"[In 2014] there were about that time around 120 [languages] with speakers, and the 18 strong languages had declined to around 13, so certainly there is ongoing decline,\" Dr Marmion said.

(Supplied: Penny Johnson) Not all bad news for languages \nDr Marmion said while the 2014 survey findings may sound gloomy, there was a positive note in that a language revival was underway. \n\"There's a wave of activity across Australia where Aboriginal people are working to revive their languages,\" Dr Marmion said. \n\"What that means is that in many cases, [they are] working with linguists to find any old historical materials or work done by linguists in past years and [are] using that to develop classes for adults and children.\" \nWhile Dr Evans admitted saving the few 'strong' languages was a battle against the clock, he believes Australia should be proud of its efforts to protect native tongues. \n\"It should be a source of pride to Australia ... the way people are going about documenting [Indigenous cultures],\" he said. \n\"I think we're really leading the world in how we're bringing technology to bear on this, and we shouldn't forget that speech technology is a growth industry, it's just zooming up there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T09:00:40.486+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
