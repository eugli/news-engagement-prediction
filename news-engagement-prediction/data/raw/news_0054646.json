Samsung says it retrieved an incredible 98 percent of the 3 million handsets it sold, but never clarified what it plans to do with them. \nThe new units will give the South Korean giant another chance at reviving the Galaxy Note 7, which was on pace to be one of the best received phones of the year. Instead, it helped tank Samsung's reputation . \nThe Kankyung report says the Note 7 will relaunch by June, but did not specify pricing. \nThe Daily Dot reached out to Samsung for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:24:46.367+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
