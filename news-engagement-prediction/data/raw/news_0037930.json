Bus driver Leon Delahaye, 44, was spat on by a banker while doing his job (Lucy Young) \nA charge of racially aggravated assault was dropped following a review of the footage. \nMr Delahaye, who has been a London bus driver since 2005, told the Standard: “He is the lowest of the low. \n“He was swearing at me and was really abusive. In more than 10 years of driving London buses I’ve never experienced anything like it. This is the first incident I’ve had. \n“I think a fine was the right sentence but it should have been more, considering his earnings, he should have been fined at least a month’s wages. \n“Driving a London bus is hard work and drivers shouldn’t have to put up with abuse like this, especially from bankers who treat the general public with contempt. \n“To be honest all I want him to do is recognise what he has done, but I believe his tears were crocodile tears. \n“He should be really ashamed of himself. I don’t think he’s in touch with the real world.” \nFountzoulas lives in Westbourne Terrace, Bayswater, where three-bed flats fetch more than £2.5million. \nAccording to his LinkedIn profile he is a vice president at Barclays investment bank, and has previously has worked for Bank of America Merrill Lynch, General Electric, Ford and Unilever. \nHe boasts of being a salsa dance teacher and kung-fu master with six different languages. \nDominic Thomas, defending, said: “He was effectively cut up on Piccadilly, those who have driven on Piccadilly will not be surprised by that.” \nMr Thomas said that Fountzoulas’ partner’s father had been killed in a road accident in November 2015 and it had a great effect on him. \n“This matter brought back the loss of her father,” said Mr Thomas. \nJudge Jonathan Hall QC, sentencing, said the fact that Mr Delahaye was a public servant and Fountzoulas spat into the cab were “significant factors”. \nMr Delahaye was “just doing his job”, said the judge. \n“It is the fact that you ran after him and then spat through the open window while he was driving his bus has real seriousness. Whether he was driving badly is neither here nor there.” \n“In my view the only sentence is a fine and compensation. I am told you earn £1,130 a week and that is the fine I will set.” \nHe also ordered the defendant to pay £500 in compensation to Mr Delahaye.
