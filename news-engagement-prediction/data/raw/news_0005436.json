The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the pitcher still has to undergo a medical exam before the deal can be finalized. \nThe 32-year-old Logan pitched for Colorado last season, going 2-5 with a 3.69 ERA in 66 appearances for the Rockies. Logan has previously pitched for the New York Yankees, Atlanta Braves and Chicago White Sox. \nThe Indians have been interested in adding another veteran lefty to their strong bullpen. Cleveland acquired Andrew Miller from the Yankees at last summer’s trade deadline deal, a move that helped the Indians win an AL pennant. \nLogan has a 28-23 career record. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:31:03.730+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
