Apple/Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET \nApple is reportedly designing a chip for Mac laptops that could boost battery life while also helping it achieve more independence from Intel chips, which are currently the brains of devices. \nCiting people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg said Wednesday that Apple is working on a chip for Mac laptops that would \"take on more of the functionality\" handled now by Intel chips. Codenamed T310, the chip is said to be similar to the ARM-based one it developed to power the Touch Bar in the 2016 MacBook Pro . \nBloomberg added that the chip, which would also be ARM-based, went into development last year and \"would handle some of the computer's low-power mode functionality. The new chip would reportedly take on low-power mode function, which would conserve power and potentially translate to a boost in battery life. \nIt would also make MacBooks look a lot more like iPhones and iPads, in which Apple uses its own chips. \nAn Apple representative declined to comment. \nLife, disrupted : In Europe, millions of refugees are still searching for a safe place to settle. Tech should be part of the solution. But is it? CNET investigates. \nDoes the Mac still matter? Apple execs tell why the MacBook Pro was over four years in the making, and why we should care.
