Dawn breaks in Cowra, a New South Wales town challenging ‘tough on crime’ approaches.

Indigenous incarceration: turning the tide on colonisation's cruel third act Read more \nCowra lies in Wiradjuri country , stretched out along the banks of the Lachlan river in central west New South Wales. It is best known for the Cowra breakout , when more than 1,000 Japanese prisoners of war launched a mass escape from a detention centre on the edge of town in the dying days of the second world war. More than 200 were killed in the bloody attempt, as well as four Australian soldiers. \nSeventy years on, Cowra is a monument to the power of peace and reconciliation. Up a steep hill from the main street, the beauty and grace of the sculpted Japanese gardens are testament to decades of careful, respectful work between the town, former PoWs, and Japan. \nNow, in the spirit of that healing, a three-year research project led by Dr Jill Guthrie at the Australian National University’s centre for Indigenous studies has been exploring justice reinvestment, a social concept that aims to shift spending from punishment to prevention. \nCowra’s mayor, Bill West, describes the results of Guthrie’s work as both “considerable and compelling”. \n“Too often we see a problem, real or perceived, and we come up with a knee-jerk reaction that’s sometimes worse than the original problem,” he said. They’ve taken time, done it properly, identified issues and what the community thinks.” The Japanese gardens in Cowra, the town best known for the mass breakout of Japanese PoWs during the second world war, is a testament to the power of peace and reconciliation.

It breaks your heart. You tell me what child isn’t naughty sometimes Aunty Isobel Simpson \nBut she is also worried about the trouble that many Aboriginal kids in the area have with police and the broader justice system. \nOfficers came to her door three times in the days after a robbery in town, checking the whereabouts of one of the grandkids. It’s nothing new, she says. \n“Because he has been in the system, he’s done stupid things, pinching stuff, they blame him straight away,” she says. “He said the detective pulled him up in the street and searched him.” \nIt’s a cycle for so many young Aboriginal people – early interactions with child protection and the criminal justice system interconnect with racial profiling by police, disrupting family connections, schooling and jobs prospects, and ultimately leading to their over-representation in prison and a pattern of recidivism. \nAnd it starts very young for many. Aunty Isobel gets me to look up a Cowra Guardian article from February 2015. It reports : \nAn 11-year-old boy who sat crying in the dock at Orange Local Court on Monday had to be taken to a juvenile correction centre on Monday night as a last resort. \nThe report said the Cowra boy had spent the night in the cells at Orange police station after he was apprehended by police. Told by officials that his family could not be contacted, the magistrate sent him to the Orana juvenile justice centre in Dubbo – more than 200km away from home – “as a temporary measure”. Keeping clear of prison: 'I can't go back in there' Read more \nWhile the child can’t be identified for legal reasons, Aunty Isobel talks about the routine trauma involved in Aboriginal kids being taken from families, often over minor breaches of justice orders. “It breaks your heart,” she says. “You tell me what child isn’t naughty sometimes.” \nShe says it’s often impossible, without private transport or money for fares, for families to get to court appearances in neighbouring Orange or Dubbo, hours up the road. Beyond quick fixes \nIt’s a familiar problem across Australia, exacerbated by past trauma, intergenerational poverty and health issues. Aunty Isobel says court officials are led to believe that children and young people have no family support. So they are put in care or detention – and so the cycle continues. From where I sit, the education system is preparing our young people for a lifetime of incarceration Les Coe, Cowra Local Aboriginal Land Council \nGo down to the Cowra courthouse on court day, she says. “It’s packed with Aboriginal people. Our kids get jumped on, always first up [to be blamed].” \nThen when the young ones come back to Cowra from a stint in detention or prison, they’re hard to manage, they’ve got “a real swagger”, she says. “It teaches them how to be criminals.” \nThe Cowra Local Aboriginal Land Council chief executive, Les Coe, says for young Aboriginal people in Cowra, long-term unemployment is crippling. It is not only a lack of work opportunities but years of discrimination that affects their chances. \n“From where I sit, the education system is preparing our young people for a lifetime of incarceration,” he says. “It’s all about discipline, not about education. \n“The kids get into trouble for acting up and it stays like that. Once you’ve got a name, that’s it: it’s passed on through the schools to the police, you become known in the community as a troublemaker, certainly well-known in the courts. \n“We need to get in there early and break that cycle.” Jacob's story: a second chance or a path to prison? – interactive case study Read more \nCoe is optimistic about what justice reinvestment might bring though he warns that it won’t be a quick fix. “Judging by what’s happened in the US and Canada, we can develop something over a long period of time, rather than Band-Aid treatment.” Economic sense \nChampioned originally in the US in response to huge overcrowding in prisons, justice reinvestment involves the redirection of corrections budgets to community priorities. Instead of spending money on keeping people in prison, it invests in prevention: in health, education, housing, employment – whatever helps. \nThe Aboriginal barrister and academic Prof Mick Dodson says few people realise that it costs $400,000 a year to keep a young person locked up in juvenile detention in NSW. \n“If Cowra’s got 10 of them locked up, you do the maths,” he says. “That’s $4m. Why not spend that money in the community doing good things that keep those kids out of trouble?” 'I realised I never was able to help one child': where the justice system fails Read more \nHe hastens to say that justice reinvestment is not a silver bullet or a free-for-all: “We’re not talking about keeping everyone out of prison because some people who commit offences that are horrendous are a danger to society and have to be locked up. But we’re talking about people who can’t pay their fines, doing low-level crime.” \nAustralia is now spending $4bn a year on prisons: “That’s a lot of money and it’s unsustainable.” \nBut although a Senate investigation recommended a justice reinvestment approach three years ago, Australian governments have been slow on the uptake. \nThe Maranguka justice reinvestment project in Bourke is the only major scheme in the country. South Australia has committed to two trials, and the Australian Capital Territory has an official policy but no active program. \nCowra is a community of about 12,000 people, with a “strong and proud” Aboriginal community who make up 7% of the population, compared with 2% nationally. During many consultations over the three years, the research team, led by Guthrie, met with representatives from education, employment, health, community service, police, judiciary and business sectors, as well as young people, parents, grandparents and carers.

Community representatives then worked through the crime categories behind that cost, and selected which crimes they believed could or should be dealt with by non-custodial sentences. They came up with eight categories: \n1. Traffic offences ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:51:27.390+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
