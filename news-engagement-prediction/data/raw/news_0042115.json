But Cronulla’s stuttering first half attack looked awful familiar without their scheming, sniping veteran around the ruck. \nIt looked like the Sharks, and even the NSW Blues, of two years ago. Understandably so. \nBig personalities and fine players like Paul Gallen, Andrew Fifita and to a lesser extent Luke Lewis and Wade Graham, want the ball, and want the ball often. Winners are grinners: Joe Burgess with World Club Challenge trophy. Source: Getty Images \nEnnis’s greatest skill was knowing when to give it to them, and when the attack was better served by letting loose the fast blokes in the flashy boots outside them. \nFor rookie hooker Jayden Brailey, and even young Nu Brown, to put Gallen in his place on tackle five — anywhere but first receiver — is tougher than it sounds. \nNot that it was just the young rakes taking the wrong options. Andrew Johns, the greatest half the game has seen, was onto it at halftime. \nChad Townsend had indeed spent the first 40 minutes hitting Lewis repeatedly with a face ball, leaving Jack Bird to his own thoughts and not much else on the outside time and time again. \nCronulla in the naughty corner \nAgain, nothing new here. The Sharks took home both the 2016 premiership and title for the most penalised side in the competition. \nBut it ain’t broke, so why fix it? This was Cronulla’s type of contest, a rough and ready rumble, and they attacked it with their usual gusto. Gallen argued, Graham and Fifita niggled and nagged and all was right in their world. \nExcept their handling, and the pre-season rust undid any of the good from their combative approach. \nIt’s just much harder to get under someone’s skin when you keep giving them the ball. \nFlanagan won’t mind the penalties — to a point. It’s all those dropped balls that will grind the gears come video review time. \nTurns out Joe is actually smokin’ Joe Burgess with a spectacular touchdown. Source: Getty Images \nJoe Burgess was practically laughed out of the NRL. \nThe bloke’s only 22, wants to come back, and could well have stayed with Souths keen to keep him late last year — so we won’t say he’s enjoyed the last laugh. \nBet he had fun with that one though, running a hat-trick in against the premiers and producing a treble of clutch defensive plays as well. \nHis ill-fated stint with the Chooks ended up costing him his spot in England’s Four Nations squad. \nTurning it on with Wayne Bennett still in the mother land wouldn’t have hurt his chances of a World Cup recall. \nNRL players should tweet at 3am more often \nRecent Newcastle arrival Josh Starling thought otherwise though, and let us know about it. More of it would be nice. Pom commentators talking up Joe burgess, was a joke in the nrl! — Josh Starling (@Starlo33) February 19, 2017 \nFlanno lets fly \nShane Flanagan offered a similarly frank assessment of the officiating after Cronulla were crushed 11-7 in the penalty count. \nJust like the old 3am tweet, it’s doubtful we’d have been treated to such a candid response if Flanagan wasn’t sitting in international waters. \n“I will be glad to get back to Australia and get back to the two referee system because I thought it was awful today to tell you the truth,” Flanagan said afterwards. \n“The 10 metres wasn’t 10 metres and I think Wigan were frustrated by some of the decisions as well because they were inconsistent.” \nIt depends on your definition of ‘excessive’, but that level of criticism would likely have earned a rebuke from League Central if it came after an NRL fixture. \nIt still might mind you, but Flanagan was at least at pains to stress Wigan won because they were the better side, not because of the ref. \nDownload the new FOX SPORTS App to get the latest news and scores from your NRL team.
