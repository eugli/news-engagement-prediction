Shulkin, an internist and longtime health administrator, was embraced by both Republicans and Democrats in being unanimously confirmed by the Senate late Monday to lead the troubled Department of Veterans Affairs. He is the sole holdover from the Obama administration to serve in President Trump’s cabinet.\nNo senators dissented on Shulkin’s nomination in a rare show of bipartisanship for the following a series of extremely contentious battles over Trump’s selections for his Cabinet. Shulkin’s approval makes him the 11th high-ranking Trump official to be confirmed by the Senate.\n[ Yourcomplete guide to Trump’s Cabinet confirmation schedule ]\nThe 57-year-old Pennsylvania native will now run the second-largest federal agency after serving 18 months as undersecretary for health in charge of VA’s sprawling medical system, which takes care of nearly nine million veterans a year. After a long search for a leader who could turn around a system Trump denounced on the campaign trail as a tragic failure, the president surprised critics by turning inside rather than outside for a VA leader.\nJust before the vote, the leading lawmakers on the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs urged their colleagues to put aside the partisanship that has defined the confirmation battles so far.\n“Let’s find out if there’s one thing we can agree on,” said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), the committee chairman.\nAnticipating critics nervous that the goal of the Trump administration is to turn over the VA to the private sector, Isakson said,: “Wee don’t want to privatize VA. We want to make it work.”\nShulkin will be the first secretary who did not serve in the military, a status that has disappointed some veterans groups but did not disqualify him from what proved to be one of Trump’s most difficult cabinet searches.\nDespite his relatively quick and trouble-free nod from lawmakers locked in partisan fighting over many of Trump’s nominees, Shulkin has a tall order from the president. He needs to show Trump that he can bring big changes to VA to make employees more accountable for misconduct and give veterans faster access to private doctors when they prefer outside care.\nShulkin will overseee 350,000 employees, an $82 billion budget and almost 2,000 clinics and medical centers that are ovelwhelmed with demands for care from aging Vietnam veterans and younger servicemembers who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nShulkin faces drastic shortages in front-line nurses and doctors: About 45,000 medical jobs throughout the system are unfilled. Groups that advocate for veterans are on high alert three years after a wait-time scandal in which managers ordered their staffs to cover up delays in appointments at dozens of medical centers.\nWith Trump and other critics calling for a shift to more private care outside VA, Shulkin will be under pressure to loosen the reins of a system that now limits private doctors to veterans who live too far from a VA hospital or could not get timely appointments there.\nTraditional veterans group have resisted calls for more private care. But Trump said during his campaign that he would give a credit card to every veteran who wanted to see a private doctor.\nShulkin said during his confirmation hearing earlier this month that he would seek “major reform and a transformation of VA” — but would not turn over vast parts of the federal health care system to private doctors.\n“There will be far greater accountability, dramatically improved access, responsiveness and expanded care option,” Shulkin told lawmakers on the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. “But the Department of Veterans Affairs will not be privatized under my watch.”\nRepublicans have pressed Shulkin for assurances that he will act swiftly to winnow a growing backlog in appeals of denied benefit claims. The new secretary has acknowledged the benefit appeals system as a “broken process,” largely because VA relies on outdated technology.\nShulkin came to government with three decades of experience in patient care and leading private hospitals. The son of an Army psychiatrist, he was born on an Army base and trained at VA hospitals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:57:28.124+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
