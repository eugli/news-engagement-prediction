Getty Images The Beatles have topped the list when it came to British recording artists \n\nElton John and the Rolling Stones completed the top five. \nThe survey of 1000 Brits was carried out by OnePoll in behalf of streaming music service Deezer, whose spokesman said: “Even though the British music industry is in rude health – as proven by Adele’s presence at sixth on the list – most of the top 10 best artists in history have come from decades gone by. \n“In fact, you have to look further down the top 40 to find more artists who started recording this millennium, like Amy Winehouse and Ed Sheeran. Getty Images 5 Rock band Queen came in at second place \n“This shows that the British appetite for the classics is as strong as ever, and the enduring appeal of the Beatles in particular, who have been topping these kinds of polls for close to five decades.” \nAdele, whose album 25 became the fastest-selling of all-time on its release in 2015, came in at sixth place – one spot in front of George Michael, who died on Christmas Day 2016. \nElsewhere in the list, Led Zeppelin could only manage 18th place, coming in below Status Quo, Phil Collins and Coldplay. \nAnd, when it came to his solo career, Paul McCartney also placed in 20th – making him one of two artists to appear twice in the top 40. \nThe second was Robbie Williams, whose history with boy-band Take That followed by his hugely successful solo career landed him at both 23rd and 24th.
