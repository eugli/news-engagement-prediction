It also hosted international level competitions.\nThe elegant club got its beginning in an old Toronto Transportation Commission barn, in part through the efforts of Lt.-Col. George Gooderham Blackstock.\nWhen not being a captain of industry, Blackstock liked to swat badminton birds and socialize.\nBlackstock and his chums had been playing at the Toronto Garrison Badminton Club but the old barn offered a prime spot amid mid-town estates like Oakland, which later became De La Salle College, and Casa Loma.\nMatlow, who visited the facility for various community events, said the historical significance of the building “cannot be understated.”\n“It was very unique in that when you enter the building, it’s like walking back in time,” he said. “I’m very much hoping that whatever portions of the building remain, that the club will be able to incorporate them into any redevelopment.”\nIt wasn’t a big facility but it had a homey grace.\n“The compact size of the property has influenced the direction of the club for many decades and ensured that it has remained intimate in scope, a true strength of the club today,” a club release said. “Over the years, club leaders and designers have been particularly innovative, adding facilities, reallocating space, and maximizing the property.”\nIn recent years, the B&R repurposed itself as a racquets, fitness and social club, which promised, according to its Facebook page, “A boutique club experience with excellent service, active social calendar, and passion for racquet sports in tennis, squash, platform, and badminton.”\nThe club had just reopened in mid-2016 after a major renovation.\nWith files from Alicja Siekierska", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:33:10.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
