The image of the Republic is being tarnished. We have to urgently find a solution,” Stephane Troussel, a Socialist politician in charge of the Seine-Saint-Denis region where Aulnay-sous-Bois is located, said, as cited by French media. \nEarlier Monday, a crowd of demonstrators marched from the victim’s home to the police station in the commune of Aulnay-sous-Bois, the area of the assault, Le Monde reported . Protesters sang La Marseillaise and chanted slogans against police brutality.

Theo’s account of the events, which his lawyer shared with BFMTV, told how police ordered young people to stand against a wall, with which he complied. However, this was followed by an unprovoked assault accompanied by racial slurs. \"Non à la violence\" et \"On est tous Theo\" scandent les manifestants #justicepourtheo #aulnaysousbois pic.twitter.com/RoXze8l0uR — Kozi Pastakia (@Kozi_P) February 6, 2017 #Aulnay - Des tensions en cours ce soir à #AulnaySousBois .

All have initially denied charges against them. \n#France #Latest Several arrested, 3 cars & trash bins set ablaze on 3rd night of clashes at #aulnay - @thomaspoupeau pic.twitter.com/cKOnNxIn4w — José Miguel Sardo (@jmsardo) February 7, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T09:14:01.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
