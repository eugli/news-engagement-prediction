If Nuttall was at Hillsborough he clearly didn't learn its most powerful lesson: Every right-wing gobshite who lies about it gets found out — Brian Reade (@BrianReade) February 14, 2017 \nBanks - a multi-millionaire diamond mine-owning insurance tycoon who has bankrolled Ukip in the past and played a key role in Brexit - responded he was “sick to death of hearing about it”, arguing Hillsborough was “not some sort of cultural happening”. I'm sick to death of hearing about it. It was a disaster and that's it, not some sort of cultural happening https://t.co/KTJPosOGDo — Arron Banks (@Arron_banks) February 14, 2017 Reade responded that his comments represented “Ukip in all its ugliness”, and was “all you ever needed to know about Ukip in one ugly quote”. @Arron_banks sorry you're sick to death hearing about 96 deaths. And 'some sort of cultural happening' eh? There's UKIP in all its ugliness — Brian Reade (@BrianReade) February 14, 2017 Sick to death hearing about 96 deaths: All you ever needed to know about UKIP in one ugly quote... https://t.co/cLxmVLZ1ZV — Brian Reade (@BrianReade) February 14, 2017 Banks clarified that he was “sick” of people “milking a tragedy forever”. No milking a tragedy forever is sick https://t.co/t1AHg6WJqb — Arron Banks (@Arron_banks) February 14, 2017 In response, Reade underlined the “27 years state cover-up”, and called him a “sad sad little man”. Unlawful Killing verdicts after 27 years state cover-up equates to milking it eh? Oh dear. Sad sad little man https://t.co/1AeZU4Uyxo — Brian Reade (@BrianReade) February 14, 2017 In April last year, an inquest found the 96 Liverpool fans who died at Hillsborough were unlawfully killed. \nThe conclusions followed previous inquests in 1991, which recorded verdicts of accidental death. That ruling was later quashed after it was claimed that authorities had manipulated the timing of events to deflect blame from them and on to fans. \nLast year, a jury ruled fan behaviour did not cause or contribute to the tragedy and the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed it was beginning the process of considering criminal charges. But Banks described Britain’s worst sporting disaster as “an awful accident at a football ground, that’s it”. It was an awful accident at a football ground , that's it. https://t.co/50NniGeluO — Arron Banks (@Arron_banks) February 14, 2017 Reade pointed out the jury’s verdict of “unlawful killing” as opposed to Hillsborough being “an accident”. Read. This. Very. Slowly. After 27 years fighting lies, the British state you so love, admitted it wasn't an accident but unlawful killing https://t.co/jE23n0wgOo — Brian Reade (@BrianReade) February 14, 2017 Darren Staples / Reuters UKIP leader and Stoke Central by-election candidate Paul Nuttall. Banks continued ... ... “as for a cover-up it was the 80s” ... if a policemen opens a gate trying to help and makes a bad decision it's an accident. As for a cover up it was the 80's. https://t.co/shIMzVXNoL — Arron Banks (@Arron_banks) February 14, 2017 ... “this could have happened anywhere, anytime” ... It was the 80's , I been at some matches that were squeezed beyond belief. This could have happened anywhere anytime. https://t.co/W8gAyZYr5Q — Arron Banks (@Arron_banks) February 14, 2017 ... “overcrowded matches were normal” ... Of course , but that doesn't mean he set out to kill people. Now days someone has to be to blame. Overcrowded matches were normal https://t.co/ZdCmamY7Xj — Arron Banks (@Arron_banks) February 14, 2017 ... “life is unfair and accidents happen” ... People hysterical and to be frank it's about people realised that sometimes life is unfair and accidents happen https://t.co/ED4ZsQHpkd \nBanks, who ran the Leave.EU campaign group and met Donald Trump with Nigel Farage in New York after the shock US Presidential election result , faced an instant backlash. \"Let's attack those who suffered at Hillsborough rather than face up to our UKIP leader's false claims about Hillsborough\" https://t.co/00SvrtAgJL — Tim Montgomerie ن (@montie) February 14, 2017 @Arron_banks You really have no shame at all. Thoroughly Trumpified. — Tim Montgomerie ن (@montie) February 14, 2017 96 people were unlawfully killed. This is a matter of record. And playing #alternativefacts with #Hillsborough .
