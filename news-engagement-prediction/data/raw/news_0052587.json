It has previously paid fines to the Electoral Commission for other offences, and in November last year was removed from the register of political parties after failing to complete an annual registration confirmation. \nBob Posner, director of party finance for the Electoral Commission, said parties had to submit up-to-date records so voters could see who was funding them and by how much. \nHe said: “We had significant concerns about this party’s willingness to comply with the rules and the loss of transparency as a result of its unprecedented history of non-compliance. The fines issued in this case reflect the serious impact that this can have on voter confidence.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:31:56.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
