ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nMorgan likes to make his sculptures in the Huatoki Stream for the peace and quiet but also so the public can still see them. \n\"From there it turned into a bit more of a thing and eventually evolved into what it is now,\" he said. \n\"I find it calming, I deal with a bit of anxiety from time to time and this helps me relax. Being out in nature, having something singular to focus on with absolute concentration is very peaceful.\" \nHe said the best things about his works are that they're temporary and that as soon as he lets his hands go from the rocks they cease to become his. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nSome take him hours others can be put together \"fairly quickly\". \n\"I just want people to get enjoyment out of seeing these, if that involves them throwing rocks at them that's fine, at least they're having fun.\" \nAs for the technique Morgan said it was \"easy to explain but hard to do\". \n\"It's all about counterbalance, you try and figure out a rough line where you want the rocks to sit and try and keep to that. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nMorgan said it's all about just getting out into nature. \n\"My advice for anyone starting out would be to start off small and work your way up. \n\"It just takes tons and tons of practice.\" \nIt wasn't until recently that Morgan bought himself a pair of fishing waders, before that he said his feet would go purple standing in rivers for hours on end. ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nPractice is key to getting as good as Morgan. \n\"It's partly to protect my feet as well, you wouldn't believe the stuff that ends up in our rivers. \n\"Lots of glass but also laptops, phones, iPads and all other kinds fo junk.\" ANDY JACKSON/Fairfax NZ \nFishing waders have helped him lift his game. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:15:46.093+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
