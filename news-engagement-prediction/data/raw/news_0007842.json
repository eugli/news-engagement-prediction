Yes this is a mature estate, but the signpost need not be gray and aged. We are not asking for anything fancy & lavish in these hard times, just some sprucing up will do the trick. \nAng Mo Kio Town Council responded promptly and wanted to replace the signboard which drew the immediate rebuke from the resident: \n\"Dear Jmsncy Ng, Thank you for notifying us about this issue. Could we know the location of this signboard so that our Property Officers can replace this signpost promptly?\" \n\"We did not ask for a replacement!! Kindly read correctly.\" Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
