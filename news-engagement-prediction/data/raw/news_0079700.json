Kimmel, first commenting on the current political climate and encouraging viewers to have a \"positive, considerate conversation\" with those they disagree with, then said, \"In spirit of healing and coming together, I'd like to bury the hatchet with someone.\" \n\"I've known Matt for a long time now. I've known Matt so long [that] when I first met Matt, I was the fat one,\" he said, as the camera panned to an unimpressed Damon. \"We've had problems — he's a selfish person, those of you who have worked with him know this.\" \nKimmel went on to say he wanted to commend one selfless thing Damon did this year. \"Matt, as you know, could have starred in Manchester by the Sea ,\" he said, \"He could have taken that lead actor part for himself, but he didn't.\" \nKimmel joked, \"He handed what turned out to be an Oscar-caliber role over to his friend [Casey Affleck] and made a Chinese ponytail movie instead. And that movie, The Great Wall, went on to lose $80 million. Smooth move, dumbass.\" \nKimmel previously told The Hollywood Reporter that his goal for the night was to \"keep him offstage.\" He said about Damon, \"I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that he doesn't win or doesn't know that he won.\" \nAt the 2016 Emmy Awards, Damon walked onstage to mock host Kimmel after he lost best variety talk series. The actor-producer admitted to Michael Strahan during ABC's preshow that he was worried about Kimmel's possible revenge, \"He's talentless himself, but unfortunately he's got an incredible group of writers who work for him.\" \nKimmel later tweeted a photo of himself watching Damon on ABC, writing, \"Dead man walking the red carpet.\" Dead man walking the red carpet. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/j2KaUkdHTX — Jimmy Kimmel (@jimmykimmel) February 27, 2017 \nDamon also told E!'s Ryan Seacrest that Kimmel's attempts to keep him from entering the venue and off the stage wouldn't work, \"I'm a member of the Academy so I think I'm going to be able to definitely make it into the theater. I don't know what he has in store for me; it's going to probably be ugly.\" \nOn settling their (friendly) feud, he said, \"We've tried a lot of couples therapy and that hasn't seemed to cut through it all. So maybe tonight's our night.\" \nThe 89th annual Academy Awards took place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood on Sunday.
