Left unchecked, such breaches can undermine public trust in Singapore’s electoral process.\n\nCandidates and their supporters are expected to abide fully by all relevant laws on Cooling-off Day and Polling Day, and should refrain from conduct that goes against the spirit behind the prohibition against campaigning on Cooling-off Day and Polling Day.\n\nAnyone found to have breached the rules in future elections will be subjected to police investigations and may face prosecution. \n- CNA/dl\nEmail More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:58:57.130+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
