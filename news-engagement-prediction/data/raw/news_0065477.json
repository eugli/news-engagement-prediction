It's how I see it regularly, to see the extraordinary in the ordinary.\"\nThe deadline to submit a poem is March 20, which gives Fahner and fellow poet Tom Leduc time to go through the submissions.\n\"I'm hoping people who think they can't write poetry will try to write poetry,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T05:45:00.822+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
