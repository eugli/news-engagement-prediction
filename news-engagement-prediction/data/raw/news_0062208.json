Their voices lost.’ To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nIn the footage, many of the child brides are accompanied by much older men to signify the all too often fate of young female refugees. \nThe mannequin challenge stunt played out on Dublin’s South King Street and was organised by child rights organisation Plan International Ireland . \nThe group hope to show support and raise awareness for the 16.5 million girls who are globally displaced because of conflict or persecution. More than 100 girls took part (Picture: PA) Girls dressed as child brides take part in a ‘mannequin challenge’ on Dublin’s South King Street (Picture: PA) \nThe clip comes amid backlash towards the Government, as it emerged just 350 unaccompanied children will be given a home in the UK under the so-called Dubs amendment. \nThe number is far fewer than the 3,000 campaigners had initially hoped for. Chilling video shows moment man describes how he killed his girlfriend \nThe latest development does not alter the closure of the Dubs scheme under section 67 of the Immigration Act, but it could help children with relatives in the UK who may be eligible for asylum under the Dublin Regulation covering family reunion cases. \nAfter the clearance of the Calais Jungle site, children who were moved to migrant centres across France were assessed under the Dubs and Dublin criteria. \nA Home Office spokeswoman said: ‘Children in France may be eligible to be transferred to the UK where they have a family link as set out in the Dublin Regulation. The demo was organised by child rights organisation Plan International Ireland, to show support for the 16.5 million girls who are globally displaced because of conflict or persecution (Picture: PA) \n‘We have agreed with the French authorities that we will review any new information from children formerly resident in the Calais camp to assess whether it would change our determination of their eligibility under the Dublin Regulation, to encourage an application.’ Peggy, 96, has been volunteering at a homeless shelter for 80 years \nThe development came as The Guardian reported migrant youngsters had returned to the site of the former Calais camp in a renewed effort to make the crossing to the UK. \nOne teenager who arrived in London this weekend after hiding beneath a coach at the port told the newspaper that increasing numbers of children in French reception centres had lost hope of travelling to the UK by official means and were returning to Calais. \nThe decision, which sparked an outcry, will come under scrutiny at Westminster this week with a special session of the Home Affairs Select committee on Wednesday and a House of Commons debate on Thursday. Many of the child brides were accompanied by much older men (Picture: PA) \nThe UK Government said it is ‘committed to supporting vulnerable children who are caught up in conflict and danger’.
