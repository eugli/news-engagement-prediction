"", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Map: QLD \nQueensland's political parties are scrambling to come to terms with proposed boundary changes that redraw the electoral map, only months from an expected election. \nThe Redistribution Commission shocked MPs and party officials with the extent of its draft new boundaries, with 19 new or renamed seats including four additional electorates in the south-east. \nThe careers of ministers and MPs are on the line, including Labor's Steven Miles and the LNP's Scott Emerson, whose Brisbane seats of Mt Coot-tha and Indooroopilly are absorbed into the newly named Maiwar. \nIn the north, the Katter Party's Shane Knuth and the LNP's Dale Last will have to cope with their seats of Dalrymple and Burdekin being redrawn into Hill and McMaster. \n\"It is disappointing,\" Mr Knuth said \n\"I'm going back to the constituents and seeking their advice and also will be communicating with the family about where we go from here.\" \nPopulation growth areas like the Gold Coast, western Brisbane, and the Sunshine Coast corridor have been reshaped with at least six new or redrawn electorates: Bonnery, Theodore, Jordan, Macalister, Bancroft and Ninderry. \nBut in dozens of other seats, boundary movements present a new challenge to the existing parties which now have to plan different strategies for placing candidates and mounting a campaign.

(Supplied: Queensland Redistribution Commission) \nABC election analyst Antony Green said it was big shake-up because the total was being increased from 89 to 93. \n\"If they had just been a redistribution on the existing 89 districts, then most of the changes would have been incremental,\" he said. \n\"But with the creation of new seats, those new seats of have gone in certain areas and caused a significant move of existing seats. \n\"There is a lot of very major boundary changes in parts of the state.\" Changes bigger than expected \nGriffith University's Dr Paul Williams said the proposed redistribution was bigger than expected, but did not appear to favour any party. \nBut he questioned the necessity of changing so many seat names. \n\"I don't think there are any great winners or losers out of this,\" Dr Williams said. \n\"It seems to me to be a pretty fair and equitable redistribution. \n\"I think the only criticism that people might have is that perhaps there is a huge change in names which might add a level of confusion. \n\"I think a lot of people will be surprised that almost all, if not all seats have been at first glance changed and not just in terms of geographical boundaries. \n\"A lot of the actual names of the seats have changed and some people would argue unnecessarily.\" \nThe commission will call for comments and suggestions on the draft boundaries. \nAfter a period of 90 days the commission will make a final determination, with a further period of 21 days allowed for legal appeals.
