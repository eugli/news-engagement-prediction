The Sunday Times claim the USADA report also reveals: Salazar and seven of his athletes — including the Olympic silver and bronze medallist Galen Rupp — sought to obstruct the USADA investigation by refusing to handover medical records; Farah received an infusion of the legal supplement L Carnitine in 2014, which USADA are investigating in case the method of infusion broke doping rules by going over the legal limit of 50ml; UK Athletics also have questions to answer because a doctor assigned to look after Farah was ignored when he raised his concerns with UKA medical staff about Salazar's methods and said he feared the health of the four-times Olympic champion was being endangered. A leaked report says Farah may have been put at risk by 'potentially harmful mediation' In an interview with USADA, Dr John Rogers said he was concerned about off label and unconventional uses of the prescription medications calcitonin, thyroxine, and high doses of vitamin D. And he raised his concerns by sending an email to UKA medical chiefs, but clearly it was not enough for either Farah or UKA to sever their ties with Salazar. When the allegations against Salazar first surfaced in 2015, UKA boss Neil Black insisted the governing body had done its 'due diligence' before allowing their star distance runner to move to Oregon in 2011 to work with the American former marathon champion. Indeed Salazar is listed as an unpaid consultant for UKA and in 2015 Black was reported to have said of the American that 'he is absolutely brilliant'. 'He is a genius,' Black reportedly added. 'And he is one of the best people to work with that I have ever come across.' In August 2015 Black insisted he was 'really comfortable' with the fact that his organisation was still working closely with Salazar, despite the USADA investigation. Salazar, Farah and other Nike Oregon Project athletes have consistently denied wrongdoing In June 2016 Farah responded to claims that USADA had dropped their investigation by claiming he had been vindicated as a result. The Mail on Sunday, however, understand that the investigation has simply been held up by a legal dispute with the Texan medical authorities because of the anti-doping agency's bid to depose a doctor – Jeffrey Brown – regularly employed by the NOP. While Salazar, Farah and other NOP athletes – among them Olympic silver medallist Galen Rupp – have consistently denied any wrongdoing, the leaked report alleges that Salazar routinely gave Farah and other athletes prescription drugs without a justifiable medical reason. The report allegedly states: 'USADA continues to investigate circumstances related to L-carnitine use by Mo Farah and L-carnitine infusion received by Mo Farah.' The Sunday Times quotes a message they claim was sent by Salazar to Armstrong, their friendship arising through their connections with Nike and the fact that Salazar paced the disgraced cyclist in the New York Marathon when he first retired from bike racing. 'Lance call me asap! We have tested it and it's amazing,' Salazar said of L-carnitine. Allegations against Salazar first surfaced during a BBC Panorama show in 2015 The Sunday Times also state: 'USADA believes the L-carnitine infusions given by intravenous drip to six top American runners training with Salazar 'almost certainly' broke anti-doping rules. L-carnitine is not a banned substance for athletes but infusions of more than 50ml in the space of six hours are prohibited.' The report, claim the Sunday Times, also states that USADA found 'substantial and compelling evidence' that Salazar and his team's physician, Dr Brown, 'conspired to collude together' to use medications and medical procedures in risky and 'sometimes potentially unlawful' ways in order to boost athletic performance. UK Athletics, speaking on behalf of the doctor who administered the infusion, told the Sunday Times: 'To our knowledge, all doses administered and methods of administration have been fully in accordance with Wada [World Anti-doping Agency] approved protocol and guidelines.' It is not known if the allegations in the report have been in any way resolved since it was written in March 2016. Two years ago Farah told The Sunday Times that he had 'tried a legal energy drink' containing L-carnitine but 'saw no benefit' and did not use it again.
