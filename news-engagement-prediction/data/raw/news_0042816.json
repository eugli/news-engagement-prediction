Two of his patients died. Christopher Duntsch was sentenced to life in prison for maiming patients who had turned to him for surgery to resolve debilitating injuries. (Dallas County Jail) \nThe sentence “won’t obviously bring my mom back and it won’t heal the 34 people that have been affected,” said Caitlin Martin-Linduff, whose mother Kellie Martin died in 2012 following back surgery. “But it will bring some sense of justice and particularly some sense of closure.” \nRecords showed that Duntsch also operated on the wrong part of a patient’s spine and left one woman wheelchair-dependent. A surgeon testifying for prosecutors said it was like letting an amateur loose in surgery. Jerry Summers was left without leg or arm movement after spinal surgery. (ABC) \nDuntsch’s attorneys argued he wasn’t a criminal, just a lousy surgeon. \nProsecutors had accused Duntsch of maiming four patients and causing the death of at least two between July 2012 and June 2013. But the trial centered on Mary Efurd, who was 74 when she underwent surgery in 2012. Evidence showed that she lost a third of her blood volume and the use of a leg following her operation. \n“I trusted him. I trusted that he would do what was right,” Efurd testified during the trial.
