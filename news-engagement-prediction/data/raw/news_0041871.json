Kung fu pro shows ball-breaking stamina \nFor over ten years, Master Wei Yaobin has built a reputation as an ‘Iron Crotch Kung Fu’ master in the Chinese city of Luoyang, where he owns and runs a Kung Fu studio, teaching the art of how to take a powerful blow to nether-regions. In ‘Iron Crotch Kung Fu’, combatants subject themselves to strong blows and aim to build up resistance with training, thinking it is important for male sexual health. 'Iron Crotch Kung Fu' enthusiasts say the practice could cure erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation. Master Wei says that Iron Crotch Kung Fu was an exclusive practice and that only family members could previously inherit it. “We want it to be more popular and accepted by public,” Master Wei said. The practice still attracts hundreds of would-be-masters every year, despite scientific research lacking in whether or not it’s the best way to master one’s crotch.
