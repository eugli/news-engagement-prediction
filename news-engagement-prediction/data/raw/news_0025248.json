There were already hints in the literature it was there. What struck me was how robust the findings were. We found it was true whether we looked at heavy snowfall, duration of snowfall, the number of consecutive days of significant snowfall. This was true regardless of whether you were older, you were young, you had risk factors or you didn’t have risk factors,” Potter said. \nREAD MORE: Why your risk of heart attack, stroke or chest pain spikes 2 days after a snowstorm \nPotter said this isn’t the first time research on snowfall and heart health has been analyzed. But his team gained access to valuable data – two separate databases with the health information of more than 200,000 people who were admitted to hospital. Sixty-eight thousand died from heart attacks between 1981 and 2014. \nPotter’s team zeroed in on the winter months and matched them with weather reports and snowfall measurements. \nMen made up about 60 per cent of hospital admissions and deaths tied to heart attack between November and April. The day after a heavy snowfall is when these hospital visits spiked – this is when one-third of men turned up in hospital for heart-related issues. \nREAD MORE: Here’s how women’s heart attack symptoms differ from men’s \nThis wasn’t the case for women, though. Potter said he hypothesizes it’s because women don’t shovel snow. \nIt’s the “most plausible” explanation in his mind. The study concedes its limitation: they didn’t have data on who was shovelling snow, how much snow is being shovelled or whether snow removal was manual or done with, say, a snow blower. \nThe researchers say the takeaway message is to raise awareness about the risk of heart attack post-snowstorm. Shovelling snow is a demanding workout taking up more than 75 per cent of the maximum heart rate, especially if you’re working with heavy tools, the study suggests. \nEarlier this month, U.S. scientists said that it’s two days after a healthy dose of snowfall that hospitals see a spike in heart attacks, strokes and chest pain. \nThe Harvard School of Public Health study suggests the climb is as steep as 23 per cent. \nWhy the two-day delay? The scientists guess it’s because snowstorms keep people indoors and away from potential hazards. There could also be a delay – people may not want to head to hospital in the middle of a whiteout. \nREAD MORE: What floor you live on may determine cardiac arrest survival, Canadian study suggests \nSnow shovelling could also be a factor. When the snow settles, that’s typically when people head outdoors to clear their driveways. \nThe medical community always pointed to a link between the cold season and an increase in heart attacks, but researchers say that people in warmer locations aren’t any less vulnerable. \nThey suggest that other factors are at play, too: shorter days, falling out of good habits and daily exercise all wreak havoc with our health and immune systems. \nThe dip in temperatures makes blood vessels constrict, driving up your blood pressure. Your heart is forced to work overtime as your blood’s gateways narrow, decreasing blood flow. \nREAD MORE: Male heart attack patients receive faster care than women, Canadian study suggests \nAnother “interesting phenomena” about winter is that the body’s blood itself thickens, making it more likely to clot when exposed to the cold. \nWinter is also notorious for the flu season as influenzas and other bugs make their rounds through the population. \nRead the latest findings in the CMAJ . \ncarmen.chai@globalnews.ca ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:31:16.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
