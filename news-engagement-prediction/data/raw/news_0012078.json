The former US President recently put his skills to the test, picking up kitesurfing and then going up against billionaire Richard Branson in a friendly challenge. \nThey competed to see who could stay up longer - Obama while kitesurfing or Branson foilboarding. A video posted on Branson's YouTube channel on Tuesday (Feb 7) showed them fully immersing themselves in the task. Former US President Barack Obama learning to kitesurf in the Carribbean.

(Photo: Jack Brockway/Virgin) \nBoth made progress over the days and were “neck-and-neck until the last run on the last day”, but in the end, Obama exceeded Branson’s distance by 50 metres. \n“I was feeling very pleased with myself, only to look over and see Barack go 100 metres on his kiteboard! I had to doff my cap to him and celebrate his victory,” said Branson. “After all he has done for the world, I couldn’t begrudge him his well-deserved win.” Branson added that they plan to do the long kite over to Anegada together on Obama’s next visit.
