Image: Gallo Images/ Thinkstock Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan has announced hard-hitting increases in personal income tax of R16.5bn for 2017-18‚ as economic growth stutters and revenue collection falls short of expectations. \nThese increases are part of a total R28bn package of tax hikes. Budget 2017: Rich to bear the brunt of the tax increases \nTax revenue has deteriorated by a further R7bn since the medium-term budget policy statement in October and is now forecast to be R30.4bn lower than the 2016-17 budget estimate‚ indicating a deterioration in economic growth and tax buoyancy. \nThis is the largest underperformance since the 2009 recession and Gordhan told journalists at a media briefing ahead of his budget speech in the National Assembly on Wednesday that he was concerned about the state of revenue collection in the country and had been engaging with senior management of the South African Revenue Service (SARS) about this. Budget 2017: Brace yourself if you’re a drinker or smoker \nIn his speech the minister warned SA was “at a crossroads” and “tough choices” had had to be made. \nTreasury officials warn there are “significant risks” to revenue collection and economic growth in the period ahead and that these remain high. \nThe tax increases announced by the minister include a new top personal income tax rate of 45% for the estimated 100‚000 individuals with taxable incomes above R1.5m‚ which will raise R4.4bn. The previous top bracket of 41% was set at R701‚301. Budget 2017: Pain at the petrol pump \nLimited relief is provided for fiscal drag: the withholding tax on dividends will increase from 15% to 20% and the general fuel levy‚ the Road Accident Fund levy and excise duties for alcohol and tobacco will also rise. \nTotal tax increases of R28bn are required to fill the gaping hole in government finances and are necessary for government to maintain what Treasury described as a “measured‚ prudent course of fiscal consolidation”. This aims to narrow the budget deficit and stabilise debt. Budget 2017: Schools the big winners \nA further R15bn in tax increases will be announced in next year’s budget. \n“The budget reflects a balance between maintaining our spending commitments and ensuring long-term health of the public finances‚” Gordhan said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:40:24.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
