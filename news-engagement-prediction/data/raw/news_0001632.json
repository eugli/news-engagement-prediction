This is because the ruling clerics' theocratic constitution has confined Iran with such unbending legal and social restrictions that change is made impossible, and the political establishment of the ruling clerics is becoming more and more incompatible with the standards, rules and international laws of the international community. \nIn addition, according to the Islamic Republic's constitution , people do not have the right to change the fundamentals of the constitution; only the Supreme Leader has such a right. Many politicians, policy analysts, and scholars have been arguing for a long time, since 1979, that the Islamic Republic of Iran will change for the better honoring its own citizens and the rules of the international community. However, history has forcefully shown that their arguments have repeatedly failed. \nThere exist ample reasons why moderating the Iranian government and a change in the Iranian government from a Shiite theocracy toward a democratic system of governance would be conducive and beneficial not only to the Iranian people, but also for the regional and global stability, peace and security.Instead of delving into these reasons, which are evident and explicit, the major question to address would be: what are some effective and non-violent approaches to channel such democratic reform in Iran? \nSome critical approaches include standing with the Iranian youth, pressure from international community, focusing on Iran's human rights, violations of international laws and suppression of religious and ethnic minorities as well as human rights groups, providing Iran's opposition with social media and technologic assistances, and supporting oppositional groups.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:06:50.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
