Josh Miller/CNET \nSamsung might not be done with the Galaxy Note 7 after all, according to The Investor , citing \"unnamed Samsung sources.\" \nThe company is rumored to sell refurbished Note 7 models with smaller batteries. Samsung is estimated to have lost $5 billion total from recalling and then stopping production of the Galaxy Note 7 after two separate battery flaws caused some units to catch fire . Selling refurbished models that avoid these internal errors could help the tech giant recoup some losses. \nThe refurbished Note 7 phones -- which might also have a smaller case size in addition to a shrunken battery -- could arrive as soon as June, according to the report. It isn't clear which markets would receive the phones. \nMeanwhile, Samsung is preparing to launch the Galaxy S8 , its first phone since the Note 7 disaster. The Galaxy S8 battery will have undergone a new eight-point test, Samsung vowed, along with every future phone. Samsung mobile chief DJ Koh also confirmed the CNET that the company is on track to release a \"very innovative\" Note 8 . \nSamsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
