Dutton was found in the woods, behind a business, after the walker’s call about 5 p.m. \nLt. Brian Catlett of Shrewsbury police said a preliminary investigation determined that Dutton, 26, went off the road and crashed in the 3900 block of Shrewsbury Avenue. \nAsked if the remains could have been there since Jan. 11, Catlett said: “The matter is still under investigation. We’re certainly looking at any and all possibilities.” \nAn autopsy is pending. \nCrystal Broski, Dutton’s sister, said he was from Kansas City but had come to the St. Louis area months ago to live with his brother, Julian Broski, of Arnold. She said he was recovering from alcohol and drug use. The father of three was planning to move back to Kansas City, Crystal Broski said. \nDutton, his brother and a half-dozen friends were out riding motorcycles the night of Jan. 11. They are stunt riders and had been doing wheelies. His brother said the group lost track of him about 9:30 p.m. when he sped off south on Interstate 55 from downtown St. Louis. Crystal Broski said her brother estimated Dutton was going about 130 mph. \nCrystal Broski, who lives in the Kansas City area, said the family had asked St. Louis police to ping his phone shortly after his disappearance, but they had refused. \nSt. Louis police said they did get a search warrant to trace Dutton’s cellphone, but that wasn’t obtained until Jan. 31, and no hits were received. If the phone had been on, the battery may have been dead by then. They did not release other details of their efforts to find Dutton. \n“I don’t know how long my brother was in those woods,” Crystal Broski said. “His mother is falling apart thinking her son was in the cold for 25 days.” \nJulian Broski and others had searched many times for Dutton, focusing on I-55, though it now appears he may have headed west on Interstate 44 before crashing. \nThree carloads of Dutton’s friends and family came from Kansas City on Saturday morning to search a stretch of I-55 extending to Arnold, looking in ditches and under bridges, but they also came up empty. Only after Crystal Broski returned to Kansas City that night did she learn from her brother in Arnold that police had found Dutton’s body in Shrewsbury. \nShe said a relative identified Dutton through his tattoos. \nTim O’Neil of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:56:32.609+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
