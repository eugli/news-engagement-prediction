It's significant because a court has prohibited Robin, per Paula's request, from going near the kid in the wake of allegations he was physically abusive to the boy. \nSources connected with the exes tell us Paula has softened on the issue, and agreed to let Robin see Julian 3 days a week for a few hours each day ... but a court-appointed monitor must be present. The monitor was with the father and son at Kids World. \nAs for why the change of heart ... we're told Paula wants Julian to still have a relationship with his dad. \nRobin has denied being physically abusive, and a super contentious series of court hearings are slated for this month and next.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:11:46.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
