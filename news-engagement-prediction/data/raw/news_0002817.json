Fast food wrappers contain carcinogenic chemicals, study says Published time: 2 Feb, 2017 13:33 Get short URL © Getty Images The next time you get a craving for a greasy burger from the drive-thru, you may want to reconsider. A new study has found that fast food packaging contains cancer-causing chemicals – showing that the risk of quick meals goes beyond trans fats and calories. \nIt's no secret that fast food contains a huge amount of oils, but in an effort to repel those oils, the packaging is actually posing a huge risk to consumers, according to a new study published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters. \nIn an effort to determine whether the wrappers contained harmful chemicals, the researchers gathered 400 take-out packaging samples from fast food restaurants across the US.

The chemicals were found to migrate from the packaging to the food itself. \n\"Food contact material is a direct route of exposure to these chemicals for us, it’s as if you were drinking them in your drinking water,” Tom Brunton of the Green Science Policy Institute, which was involved in the study, told CBS Bay Area. \nStudy co-author Graham Peaslee, a physicist at the University of Notre Dame, said he was \"very surprised to find these chemicals in food contact materials from so many of the samples we tested,\" according to a Green Science Policy Institute press release.
