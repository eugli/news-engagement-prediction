It can cause problems with vision, balance, muscle control, and other basic body functions. \nThe effects are often different for everyone who has the disease. Some people have mild symptoms and don’t need treatment while others will have trouble getting around and doing daily tasks. \nMS happens when your immune system attacks a fatty material called myelin, which wraps around your nerve fibers to protect them. Without this outer shell, your nerves become damaged. Scar tissue may form. The damage caused prevents your brain from sending signals through your body correctly. Your nerves also don’t work as they should to help you move and feel. \nLukemia is a malignancy, cancer, of blood cells. \ncontinue reading below our video What Can The Apple Watch Do And Do I Need One? In leukemia, abnormal blood cells are produced in the bone marrow. Leukemia usually involves the production of abnormal white blood cells, the cells responsible for fighting infection. However, the abnormal cells in leukemia do not function in the same way as normal white blood cells. The leukemia cells continue to grow and divide, eventually crowding out the normal blood cells. The end result is that it becomes difficult for the body to fight infections, control bleeding, and transport oxygen. \nSpinal Bifida is a type of birth defect called a neural tube defect. It occurs when the bones of the spine, the vertebrae, don't form properly around part of the baby's spinal cord. Spina bifida can be mild or severe. \nThe mild form is the most common. It usually doesn't cause problems or need treatment. You can't see the defect, but some people may have a dimple, birthmark, or hairy patch on their back. Most people with this form don't know they have it until they get a back X-ray for another reason. \nA rare and more severe form is meningocele. In this form, fluid leaks out of the spine and pushes against the skin. You may see a bulge in the skin. In many cases, there are no other symptoms. \nThe most rare and severe form is myelomeningocele. It's what most people mean when they think of spina bifida. Part of the spinal nerves push out of the spinal canal, and the nerves are often damaged. You may see a bulge in the skin. In some babies, the skin is open and the nerves are exposed. \nSuicide - A suicide attempt is a clear indication that something is gravely wrong in a person’s life. No matter the race or age of the person, how rich or poor they are, it is true that most people who die by suicide have a mental or emotional disorder. The most common underlying disorder is depression, 30% to 70% of suicide victims suffer from major depression or bipolar, manic-depressive, disorder. \nEight out of ten people considering suicide give some sign of their intentions. People who talk about suicide, threaten suicide, or call suicide crisis centers are 30 times more likely than average to kill themselves. \nNo suicide attempt should be taken lightly or dismissed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:13:41.601+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
