But with the Senate apparently evenly split on her nomination, we’re entering uncharted territory.\n— Vice President Mike Pence will probably have to cast the tie-breaking vote for DeVos — something that has never happened before for a cabinet nominee.\n— No Education secretary nominee has ever faced a vote this close . The closest vote to confirm a past nominee was John B. King, Jr., who cleared the Senate on a 49-40 vote, according to the Congressional Record.\n— “It’s never been a controversial thing — until now,” said Christopher P. Loss, a Vanderbilt University professor who studies the history of education policy. “The only real controversy was whether education deserved a departmental rank back in the 1970s. The combination of DeVos’ horrible, cringe-inducing hearing performance and the Democrats’ desire to somehow stymie Trump has placed her nomination on the brink.”\n— DeVos’ opponents have not given up . Both GOP defectors — Sens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski — noted the massive volume of calls coming into their offices when declaring they would vote against DeVos. “I have heard from thousands — truly thousands — of Alaskans who shared their concerns about Mrs. Devos,” Murkowski said. “KEEP CALLING,” DeVos critics urged on Twitter . “The nation is speaking out … senators need to listen,” NEA President Lily Eskelsen García said.\n— Among those telling senators to vote no is Eli Broad, the billionaire philanthropist who has funded charter school expansion and other education reform efforts nationwide. Broad — who, like DeVos, has faced criticism for funding charter school growth — wrote in a letter to Senate leaders Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer that he watched DeVos' confirmation hearing \"with dismay.\" Broad is a Democrat, though he has on occasion donated to Republicans.\n— But DeVos’ supporters are confident . A slew of GOP Senators issued statements stressing their support for DeVos in the hours after Collins and Murkowski said they’d vote no. “Lest there be any doubt about how I'm voting on @BetsyDeVos she had me at ‘school choice’ years ago,” tweeted Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), who some thought may have been another potential no vote.\n— “She'll be confirmed,” said Ed Patru, a spokesman for a group of DeVos supporters. “Betsy's nomination has become a proxy battle between organized labor and Republicans over accountability, local control, and parental say in matters of education. Every Republican recognizes that labor as a matter of policy puts its own political interests above the needs of kids.”\nWE’RE OVER THE HUMP. WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION.

The Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education, chaired by Republican Rep. Todd Rokita , will hold the hearing at 10 a.m. in 2175 Rayburn.\nDEVOS DOESN’T COMMIT TO PUBLISHING TITLE IX LIST: Advocates for campus sexual assault victims are concerned about Betsy DeVos’ response when asked if she’ll publish a list of colleges under investigation for mishandling sexual assault cases. The ’s Office for Civil Rights has provided a weekly list of these investigations to those who request it for more than two years. In her written responses to Sen. Patty Murray ’s questions, DeVos stopped short of committing to maintain this tradition. “If confirmed, I look forward to discussing this with the OCR leadership to understand how the release of information addresses its mission,” DeVos wrote.\n— “DeVos' answer is extremely disappointing and displays a lack of understanding of the progress that has been made since the list of investigations was released,” said Alyssa Peterson, a policy coordinator at Know Your IX, a group that advocates on behalf of sexual assault survivors. “When there is more transparency in enforcement, survivors are better able to hold the Department of Education accountable for enforcing the law and for reducing the long wait times associated with investigations.”\n— DeVos did promise to hold schools accountable for violating Title IX , the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination. “Yes, schools that violate civil rights statutes will be held accountable,” she wrote. “But let's be clear, we are a rule of law nation. Opening a complaint for investigation in no way implies that the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) has made a determination about the merits of the complaint. Any decision to release information must balance the desire for transparency with mechanisms needed to conduct an appropriate investigation.”\n— “Her refusal to commit to just about everything has been the theme of her confirmation process,” said Lisa Maatz, vice president of government relations at the American Association of University Women. “We’re pretty much disturbed by her entire nomination. The Title IX stuff by itself would be enough to stand my hair on end.”\n— The briefly refused to release the list as usual last week , which raised alarms among advocates. But after a one-day delay, the department distributed the list, while saying that the delay was merely a “misunderstanding.”\nATTORNEY SAYS SENATE SHOULD REJECT GORSUCH: A civil rights attorney who has argued cases before Trump’s Supreme Court pick is urging senators to vote against Neil Gorsuch, who the attorney says “has low expectations for people with autism and other disabilities.” Gary Mayerson, whose firm represents individuals with autism, wrote in a letter to Sen. Chuck Schumer that Gorsuch’s 2008 ruling in a case centering on what is required of schools under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is problematic.\n— The court took the side of a school in the case, in which parents of an autistic child claimed the school wasn’t doing enough to educate the student. While the student showed educational progress in classes, he didn’t seem to retain what he’d learned when he left school. Gorsuch wrote the opinion, which reversed three prior rulings. “Despite the prior court findings that the student was unable to display any of his learned skills and use them in environments outside of his school, Judge Gorsuch held for the school district by employing the lowest possible educational standard,” Mayerson wrote.\n— But in another case in 2013, Gorsuch took the side of a student with disabilities whose parents said their child was not provided an adequate education under IDEA. Gorsuch wrote that the school district “failed to provide Elizabeth with a free and appropriate public education.” The Supreme Court is currently weighing this exact legal question. It heard oral arguments last month in a case that asks how far public schools must go to provide students with disabilities a “free appropriate public education.”\nSTATE CHIEFS GROUP MEETS WITH DEVOS: Chris Minnich, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers, told Morning Education that he met with Betsy DeVos this week. A good chunk of the conversation was focused on what states need as they implement the Every Student Succeeds Act, he said. States are in the middle of drafting plans to hold schools and districts accountable for student learning and progress, among other things. But President Donald Trump placed a 60-day hold on the Obama administration’s final accountability regulation to guide those state plans. If Republicans decide to use the Congressional Review Act to scrap that rule, then states are going to need clarity — and fast, Minnich stressed to DeVos. “I tried to get across the need for stability for states on ESSA planning,” Minnich said. “They need clarity as quickly as possible.” Minnich said DeVos “asked all the right questions.” She was interested in states’ work and what state education chiefs need, he said.\n— On a related note, CCSSO and The Aspen Institute Education & Society Program are out with a report that looks at specific actions states are taking to “advance equity” for all students. That includes preparing state education officials to ensure they can “speak effectively and comfortably about race and racism.” More .\nTRUMP EO SCRAPPING GUN-FREE ZONES COMING SOON? Trump vowed on the campaign trail to ban gun-free zones, including in schools. When asked if that ban could be coming soon, Press Secretary Sean Spicer indicated Wednesday that it was still on the table. His message: Stay tuned. “I think you have seen the president has been very active in terms of getting executive orders out and following up on the campaign pledges that he made to the American people,” Spicer said. “We're going to continue to move through this process and I think we’ll have further updates with where we are with respect to the rest of the EO process”\nSNEAK PEEK: IS THE WORKFORCE OVEREDUCATED? On the campaign trail, President Trump vowed to expand career and technical training during his first 100 days. “Vocational training is a great thing,” he said . “We don’t do it anymore.” Turns out, a fair amount of people actually have a higher level of education than they need for their jobs. A full quarter of college-educated workers were overqualified for their jobs in 2014, according to a new study by the Urban Institute, which will release a detailed analysis of more than 400 occupations this afternoon. Read the study, which goes live at 4 p.m., here .\nICYMI: DEMS ‘TROUBLED’ BY TRUMP APPOINTEES’ SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS: Six Senate Democrats say they’re \"deeply troubled\" by \"racist, bigoted, and misogynistic statements\" made on social media by several of President Donald Trump's hires — an issue POLITICO first reported over the weekend. The Democrats wrote a letter to Jason Botel, new senior White House adviser for education, and Acting Education Secretary Phil Rosenfelt, saying they want a briefing on the agency's \"efforts to promote a diverse and inclusive workforce free of prejudice or malice, the administration's vetting procedures for appointees, and how the department intends to handle reports of inappropriate communications or behavior from staff.\" Caitlin Emma has more .\nREPORT ROLL CALL\n— The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, in a new report on charter school enrollment, estimates that “in 2016-17, there are more than 6,900 charter schools, enrolling an estimated 3.1 million students.”\n— A new REL Southeast study takes a look at South Carolina charter schools that are “beating the odds” and performing better than expected on the state test.\n— The Center on Standards, Alignment, Instruction, and Learning looks at successes and challenges that states have faced in implementing college and career-ready academic standards.\nSYLLABUS\n— DeVos used numbers from a K12 Inc. report to defend cyber charters in her response to questions from senator: Education Week .\n— Hillary Clinton will give the commencement address at her alma mater, Wellesley College, this spring: The Washington Post .\n— The National Labor Relations Board OKs two charter school unions: The Times-Picayune .\n— Football players at private schools with elite teams should be considered employees, the NLRB says: Inside Higher Ed .\n— In Alaska, villages cling to public school funding: The New York Times .\n— Protests at Berkeley force cancellation of Breitbart News editor and alt-right figure’s talk: The LA Times .\nAnd it occurs to him a little late in the game : Follow the Pro Education team. @ caitlinzemma ( cemma@politico.com ), @ khefling ( khefling@politico.com ), @ mstratford ( mstratford@politico.com ), @ mrmikevasquez ( mvasquez@politico.com ) and @BenjaminEW ( bwermund@politico.com ).", "external_links": ["https://www.politicopro.com/education/story/2017/01/trumps-supreme-court-pick-education-146630", "https://twitter.com/mstratford?lang=en", "https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51168", "https://twitter.com/scATX/status/826873439516557313", "https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/edlabs/regions/southeast/pdf/REL_2017236.pdf", "https://twitter.com/bathroompolice/status/826878340174745601", "https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51231", "https://twitter.com/BobSaietta/status/826873726675349505", "http://www.urban.org/research/publication/mismatch-how-many-workers-bachelors-degree-are-overqualified-their-jobs", "https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51382", "https://twitter.com/JeffFlake/status/826926186597085188", "https://twitter.com/caitlinzemma", "https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51219", "https://cd.politicopro.com/member/51218", "https://twitter.com/khefling", "http://www.slate.com/articles/life/schooled/2016/12/the_damage_donald_trump_could_do_to_public_education.html", "http://mobile.edweek.org/c.jsp?cid=25920011&item=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.edweek.org%2Fv1%2Fblog%2F63%2F%3Fuuid%3D64878&cmp=SOC-SHR-twitter", "https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/us/on-alaskas-coldest-days-a-village-draws-close-for-warmth.html?_r=0&referer=https://www.google.com/", "https://www.politicopro.com/f/?id=00000159-fbee-d439-a3db-ffff4f3e0001", "https://twitter.com/MrMikeVasquez", "https://twitter.com/BetsyDeVos", "http://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2017/02/lusher_union_international_hig.html", "https://twitter.com/BenjaminEW", "https://twitter.com/POLITICOPro", "https://twitter.com/TWWUSA/status/826874493264015363", "http://www.ccsso.org/equity", "http://c-sail.org/publications", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVaafph6HSQ", "http://go.politicoemail.com/?qs=ccc378e27457e91008349bd3bf9330133dbc32eda4386846fd2b2accd88cd0dae0ad664ecc9a91d3f998f0edc876efb144fedd2f1d426717ec7284fc559f304c", "https://twitter.com/Morning_Edu", "https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/02/01/nlrb-general-counsel-says-private-college-football-players-are-employees?utm_content=buffer4abb0&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=IHEbuffer", "https://cd.politicopro.com/member/151761", "http://mayerslaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2-1-17-Letter-re-Supreme-Court-Nominee-Neil-Gorsuch.pdf", "http://www.publiccharters.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/EER_Report_V5.pdf", "http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-milo-yiannopoulos-berkeley-20170201-story.html", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/02/01/hillary-clinton-to-deliver-2017-commencement-address-at-wellesley-college/", "https://www.politicopro.com/f/?id=00000159-f134-d755-ab5d-f93e992b0001", "https://www.politicopro.com/f/?id=00000159-fa7f-da98-a77d-fa7f8a300001"], "published": "2017-02-02T18:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:52:23.311+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
