Getty Laure Ferrari. \n“She is someone I have worked with and known well for a long time who wanted somewhere to stay for a week that wouldn’t cost her any money. It’s a working relationship,” he was quoted as saying. The Sun also reports Farage was spotted leaving his house without his wedding ring on Sunday. \nLast November the Electoral Commission announced it was opening an investigation into whether Ukip had accepted “impermissible donations” from IDDE and the Alliance for Direct Democracy in Europe (ADDE), the political party it is affiliated to. \nIt followed an audit by the European Parliament which concluded that ADDE and IDDE used EU grant funding for the benefit of Ukip in breach of its rules.The claims have been strongly contested by Ukip.
