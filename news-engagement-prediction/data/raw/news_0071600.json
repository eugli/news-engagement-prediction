Our new T-Shirt: You can shut us out out, but you can’t shut us up! pic.twitter.com/JM6NxOSYFC \n— Davan Maharaj (@DavanMaharaj) February 24, 2017 \nEarlier today, Donald Trump ‘s White House banned a number of outlets from a gaggle, including CNN, Politico , and the Los Angeles Times . \nThe LA Times ‘ Editor-in-Chief, Davan Maharaj , tweeted the above photo, which shows a t-shirt that translates the phrase “We will not shut up” into multiple languages. \nNo word yet on whether these will be available for the public to buy or if they’re exclusive to LA Times employees, but we’ve reached out to the paper for clarification and will update if and when we hear back. If they are selling the shirts, they’ll be joining Buzzfeed, who slogan-ized a Trumpian insult and had shirts bearing the phrase for sale within hours of the original jab last month. \n[image: screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
