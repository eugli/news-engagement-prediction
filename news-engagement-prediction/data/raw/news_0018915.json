He is world class in his finishing,” the Holland legend said. Koeman hopes the rest of Lukaku's game one day matches his quality in front of goal (Photo: PA) \n“He really is that good, although he needs to improve in a total picture as a player – but that part of him is world class. We know if we give him the chances, normally he will score the goals.” \nUnlike his excitable predecessor Roberto Martinez, Koeman is not a manager prone to exaggeration, and he generally prefers to help players improve their weaknesses, rather than massage their egos. \nYet he has no hesitation in comparing Lukaku to the stars of the greatest Dutch team of them all, the side that won the 1988 Euros, led by Van Basten, and typified by THAT audacious volley against Russia in the final.

I wouldn’t say anything now but maybe after the weekend yes. It’s no issue for now - playing on Saturday is more important. \n“But that is really good and important for the club, for the team and for me because at the moment it means we can keep the best players and he has seen a future in this club. That is really positive.” Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:53:13.154+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
