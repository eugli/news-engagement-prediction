(Source: IE) Stung by ‘SCAM’ and ‘KASAB’ barbs, former Union minister and Congress leader Akhilesh Das today dubbed BJP as ‘Business Jalao Party’ for resorting to demonetisation last November. “Thanks to demonetisation, nearly ten crore jobs have been lost. It was not notebandi, it was rather deshbandi,” Das told reporters here adding “BJP stands for Business Jalao Party.” “In 2017 Akhilesh will become the CM, and in 2019, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi will become the Prime Minister,” he added.\nEarlier, Samajwadi Party Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav had said re-termed the acronym ‘KASAB’-coined by Amit Shah . “BJP says ‘Ka’ stands for Congress. Your Akhilesh bhaiyya says ‘Ka’ (in Hindi) stands for Computer, ‘Sa’ stands for smartphone, through which you can get all the information about the policies of the government and ‘B’ stands for ‘bachche’ (children),” Dimple, wife of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav , said at an election rally. The ruling Akhilesh Yadav-led Uttar Pradesh Government has a scheme to distribute laptops to meritorious students and promised to give smartphones if it returns to power in the state.\nDas’ retort came against the backdrop of Prime Minister Narendra Modi describing ‘SCAM’ as an acronym for Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati and BJP president Amit Shah dubbing ‘KASAB’ as the one for Congress, SP and Behenji (Mayawati).\nWatch this also:\nThe BSP supremo has already described BJP as ‘Bhartiya Jumla (rhetoric) Party’ and punned with Modi’s initials saying they stood for “Mr Negative Dalit Man.”\nDas, at his press conference, accused BJP of trying to break the country’s backbone with its demonetisation decision. The former Union minister claimed there is a strong under-current in favour of the SP-Congress combine.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T03:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:00:08.289+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
