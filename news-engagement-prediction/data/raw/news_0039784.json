AP Images \nTwitter has a new tactic for curbing abuse and harassment:Â a time-out. \nThe company has started temporarily restricting the access of accounts it determines to be abusive, a Twitter spokesperson told Business Insider. Affected accounts willÂ only have their tweets seen by their followers until the ban is lifted. \nThe spokesperson said that Twitter started temporarily limiting accounts last week, and Heat Street was the first to notice the activity on Wednesday. \nSeveral users who areÂ temporarilyÂ restricted by Twitter have tweeted screenshots of messages they've received saying that they had violated the company's content rules . The messages said their accounts were restricted for 12 hours, but a Twitter spokesperson said the restriction's duration could be longer or shorter depending on the offender's behavior. \nHere are some examples â beware that there is graphic language used: \n>automatically get limited cause I said retardI'm just considering leaving Twitter, fuck them pic.twitter.com/2NZpOPmlo2 â đşđ¸ Drybones ă đ˝đ (@Drybones5) February 14, 2017 \n#2 in a day, pretty sure twitter doesn't like people using the word \"nigger\" pic.twitter.com/uZY38CbUrN â Americans 4 America (@Yuan1557800) February 15, 2017 \nA recently updated part of Twitter's website explains that the temporary time-outs are intended to create a \" safer environment\" on the social network: \"Conversations are core to Twitter, but if we detect behavior that may violate the Twitter Rules or inhibit other peopleâs ability to express themselves freely, we may temporarily limit certain account features. For example, this could mean only your followers are able see your activity on Twitter, including Tweets, likes, Retweets, etc. Limiting the reach of potentially abusive content creates a safer environment and stronger Twitter community.\" \nA spokesperson declined to explain how Twitter determines if an account deservesÂ to be temporarily restricted or totally suspended, but did say that the company looks at the overall context of an account's behavior rather than just potentially offensive keywords. So if an account repeatedly tweets offensive things to other accounts that don't follow back, Twitter could interpret that behavior as abuse and worthy of a time-out. \nTwitter has been plagued by high-profile cases of abuse and harassmentÂ for years, and that reputation was reportedlyÂ part of the reason why Disney backed out of talks to acquire the company last year. \nMounting criticism and slowed business growth led Twitter to recently introduce several other steps to curb abuse, including removing offensive tweets from search results, measures to keep suspended users from creating new accounts, and hiding offensive or harassing \"@\" replies.
