Diary Londoner's Diary: Maggie & Me, and a curious veil of fiction \nIn today's diary: Damian Barr and Rachel Cusk's curious veil of fiction | Norman Tebbit and his bike | Earl Spencers no Buller boy | Dame Helen Mirren and Peter Morgan at the BFI Chairman's Dinner | Sofia Helin a bridge too far | Rachel Weisz brings Hollywood to Golders Green | June Sarpong and Catherine Mayer start a riot Wednesday 22 February 2017 12:08 GMT Click to followLondoner's Diary (Photo credit should read LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images) AFP/Getty Images \nIs Damian Barr “Julian”? That’s what his friends keep asking: whether he has inspired the lead character in Transit, the latest novel by Rachel Cusk, the Canada-born writer of A Life’s Work and Aftermath. \nBarr, the Brighton-based author of Maggie & Me, a memoir of growing up in Motherwell under Margaret Thatcher, writes a fine Facebook post on this question. “Cusk’s veil of fiction is thin. Thinner than a thin thing. Diaphanous. Gossamer,” wrote Barr on a Facebook post, noting the book was not “even sparkling with a filament of irony”.Barr and Cusk met at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in 2013. They talked wet T-shirts — as does Julian in the book — and discussed his family. The character, Julian, is “fleshy”. “I am indeed fleshy. I am alive.” There are a few differences, says Barr. “I have not, and nor will I ever, own a cravat — never mind a mauve one. And I have never said ‘There, there, duck’ except, maybe, to an actual duck. No gay man has said ‘duck’ since Kenneth Williams breathed his last.” But Barr is unhappy about the similiarities to his personal story, as told in Maggie & Me and Julian’s in Transit. \n“It is true that my stepfather did ‘go to any length to underscore [his] inferiority’. But he points out, in his case, that it was not his ‘mother who dealt out the beatings’.”Barr did not wish to comment on the post. Cusk’s publishers, Harvill Secker, were not responding to our messages this morning. \n-- \nIt shouldn’t happen to a Lord. Yesterday Norman Tebbit stood up in the House of Lords and complained about London’s air quality. “It sometimes takes more than an hour to drive from Parliament Square to the Tower of London,” he said. “That is being caused by the barricades which have been put up to assist cyclists who get in the way on the main road carriageways.” Cue Lords corpsing after a heckle from the Labour benches of “Get on your bike.” (David Livingston/Getty Images) (Getty Images) \nEarl Spencer has no time for Bully boys \nLAST week we reported that Boris Johnson and David Cameron’s Oxford University Bullingdon Club was down to two members, barely enough to trash each other’s rooms, and listed Charles Spencer as an alumnus. Earl Spencer got in touch to correct us on history. “While at Oxford in the mid-Eighties, I returned to my room one day to find it ‘turned over’. I assumed there had been a burglary but my housemates informed me the Bullingdon had been round to elect me, and the damage to my room was part of that. I was not remotely interested in being part of their set-up, and declined the offered membership.” \nQuote of the day: ‘London is unquestionably the greatest eating city on Earth \nTom Parker Bowles, at the Fortnum & Mason launch of the Evening Standard’s Food Month Festival, of which he is a creative director, hails the city’s culinary excellence (Photo by David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images) \nBrushes with royalty make for a stellar career \nPeter Morgan, screenwriter of The Queen and Netflix hit The Crown, was honoured last night at the BFI Chairman’s Dinner at Claridge’s, and drew a crowd of former colleagues including Dame Helen Mirren and Gillian Anderson. Mirren, who played the title role in the Elizabeth II movie, still gives interesting insights into Her Majesty. Last time we saw Dame Helen we asked her about Jeremy Corbyn’s attendance at the Privy Council. She said the Queen would prefer someone with courage in their convictions than “some sycophantic a**elicker”. \nNo walls — just bridges \nDespite the riots in Stockholm last night, Sweden is safe, says actress Sofia Helin, pictured, star of the hit BBC4 Scandi noir series The Bridge.Donald Trump’s “Last night in Sweden” comments were followed by remarks by Nigel Farage, and others who have singled out Sweden’s third city, Malmö, as a danger area. But Helin is not afraid. “Malmö’s not dangerous,” she told us yesterday, as she arrived in the city to film the final series of The Bridge, in which she stars as homicide detective Saga Norén.“We have refugees,” she said. “These people are traumatised and scared. If there weren’t problems it would be strange. But they add to the community.” Helin is “grateful” for migrant hospital workers, who “do jobs that we don’t want to do”.Helin thinks Norén would agree. “I think she would be rational about it — ‘I don’t think this is a dangerous city’ is probably what she would say.“The bridge [from Malmö to Copenhagen] is beautiful. It has a roughness to it. You’ve got to visit!” \nTweet of the day: “Since he is no longer employed, does this mean he’ll be deported per his O-1 visa requirement?” \n@FrankLuntz hopes America will be saying a not-so-fond farewell to Milo Yiannopoulos \n-- \nHOLLYWOOD havoc in Golders Green, where Rachel Weisz and Rachel McAdams are shooting new film Disobedience, which focuses on a lesbian romance amid the Jewish community. Locals are unhappy — but not about the content of the film — it is the parking restrictions on the busy The Riding road. Shops like Kosher Kingdom are heaving on Thursdays and Fridays as locals make Shabbat preparations. Twenty parking bays were closed, according to The Jewish Chronicle. This just ain’t kosher, Rachel. \nByline fest will be a riot \nPRESENTER June Sarpong and WE Party co-founder Catherine Mayer were at the Frontline Club yesterday for the launch of the Byline Festival, an indie journo project. Billed as Woodstock for the Facebook generation, in a wood in East Sussex in June, it will include talks, parties and even a How to Riot workshop. \n-- \nMinder of the day: Sam Cameron recalls texts from Isabel Spearman, her then special adviser. “I know you’re in Uniqlo, someone’s tweeted. Remember, shut the curtain and don’t strip off in front of everyone.” \n\nFor all of today's Diary click here . \nFollow The Londoner on Twitter and Facebook here \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T14:27:09.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
