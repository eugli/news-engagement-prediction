Image caption Katy Perry's skeletons were dressed very similarly to Donald Trump and Theresa May \nThe skeletons even held hands like Donald Trump and Theresa May did during their meeting. Image caption Donald Trump and Theresa May were photographed holding hands in January \nKaty Perry performed her current single Chained To The Rhythm alongside Skip Marley, grandson of reggae legend Bob Marley. \nDuring the performance one of Katy's dancers, dressed as a house, fell off the Brits stage and into the audience. \nShe previously performed the song, which she describes as \"purposeful pop\", at the 2017 Grammy Awards, where she wore a armband with the message 'persist' written on it. \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:02:54.228+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
