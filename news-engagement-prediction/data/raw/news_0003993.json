His trade adviser also recently attacked Germany for gaining unfair trade advantages from a \"grossly undervalued\" euro. \nThe front cover image is similar to one that appeared on the front page of the New York Daily News in December 2015, also showing Mr Trump beheading the Statue of Liberty but in a less gory fashion. 'Can Trump really be compared to IS killer Jihadi John?' - German press weigh in Mass-market tabloid Bild, which has the Jihadi John headline, says that Der Spiegel has been accused of anti-Americanism in the past. \"Then [during the George W Bush presidency] it was often American interventionism that Spiegel was criticising, while with Trump it is the end of interventionism that Spiegel is criticising,\" it says. \"The Spiegel cover is exactly what Trump needs - a distorted image of him that he can make use of for his own distorted image of the press,\" writes the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung broadsheet. It says the cover lacks a sense of irony and that equating Mr Trump and terrorism is too simple. Die Welt, another broadsheet, says that the cover \"damages journalism\" rather than the new president \"because it confirms many people's preconception that the 'mainstream media' does biased reporting and that many journalists prefer to promote their own worldview than be neutral witnesses to what is happening.\" \nMr Rodriguez, who arrived in the US as a political refugee from Cuba in 1980 told the Washington Post that he wanted to make a comparison between the Islamic State and Donald Trump, saying \"both sides are extremists\". \nDer Spiegel editor Klaus Brinkbaumer wrote in an editorial that Mr Trump was \"attempting a coup from the top\" and wanted to \"establish an illiberal democracy\". \nHow the media helped Trump \nThe White House has accused liberal media groups of false and irresponsible reporting designed to smear President Trump and the new administration. \nAlexander Graf Lambsdorff, a member of the Germany's Free Democrats and vice-president of the European Parliament, said the cover said more about Der Spiegel journalists than Mr Trump. \n\"The cover plays on the lives of terror victims in a very nasty way,\" he told Bild. \nSeveral other magazines are using the front covers of their next editions to comment on the US president and his policies.
