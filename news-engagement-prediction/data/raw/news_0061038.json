Basically, nama means \"to bow\" and te means \"you.\" The Namaste salutation was transmitted from ancient India to the countries of South-east Asia, and has now traveled virtually all over the globe.

Written Notation: \nThe word \"Namaste\" is often used as a closing notation (without the accompanying prayerful hand and bowing head gestures) in written communications similar to \"sincerely,\"\"best regards\" or \"love.\" More Interpretations/Translations of Namaste \nThere are several variations of wordings which describe what Namaste means. Meanings and definitions of Namaste What does this sacred gesture mean to you? Below are suggested meaning shared by our readers. \nThe light and divinity within me bows to the light and divinity within you and all around you, always. ~Ashley L \nNamaste means Namoh+Stute.

It means in Hindi ,\" Main tuj me jo achhe sanskar hai usko naman karta hun. It means in English I bow to good (godly) qualities within you.\" As Hindus always see +ve sides of others & each person has some good qualities in him. ~prakap \nOne of my favourite interpretations for Namaste is to simply 'honour the peace within' ~Lori \nI respect the light within me and honour and respect the light that shines within you. ~highlandlass \nI was taught as a young Japanese Martial Arts Student, that although there are several interpretations from different cultures through time, that the True Meaning & Intent of the word Namaste` is: \"The Divine Wisdom In Me, Recognises & Acknowledges The Divine Wisdom In You\"! ~Jan \n\"Na\" means \"No\"or \"Not\".\"MaH\"means \"For me\".\"Te\"means, For you \"Whatever I possess on this earth belongs to you(God) I don't have any thing to claim on this earth.(na+maH+tE)\"maH\"is in the Genetive case. ~iragavarapu narasimhacharya \nNamaste as I have learnt means to bow to the light within. ~Sharon \nBecause I see yoga as a way of being one with body mind spirit and I also see meditation and honoring other religions as so too, I see Namaste being relevant in tying all of mentioned above. For example, Namaste in yoga: I honor the higher self in you. In Buddhism: i honor the Buddha nature in you. In Christianity: I honor the Christ-like self in you:) Whatever we can achieve as being great, including creativity, kindness, selflessness and we see it in someone else: Namaste would mean: I honor YOU, the greatness, individual specialness in You, because most likely there is some of that in Me too! So we could learn to first honor ourselves, then we can easily honor others. Appreciate them, bow to them, feel a loving presence for who/ all they are. ~liz \nWhen I realize the creator of the world dwells within me and you recognize that the creator of the world dwells in you, and when we both realize he has an unconditional love for us, then we are truly one. Not because we say it so, but because that creator created us to be one. He created us for this very moment when we realize that we are ONE. ~Guest MarA good friend said to me that she thought it meant \"all sacred in me greets all sacred in you.\" ~Guest Ryan \niMy interpretation is that if there is such a thing as a spark of divine in me- it humbly bows to that spark in you---- just back from first trip to Nepal and India, hard to digest ~vickilander \nNamaste ~ We are all one energy & greater consciousness ~ I bow to your physical presence within our common reality ~ Blessed journeys to you on your path in life.. ~Ironman \nThe definitions are soulfully fullfilling and in the way we Rastas say INI the I in HIM Haile Sellassie I, is the I in me and You, which means we recognize the God in all.. Namaste ~Empress \nThe meaning of Namaste to me is simply, \"The light in me recognizes the light in you. ~Rose \nMy interpretation has been: The light within me honours the light within you. However, I do like some of these others very much! ~Debra \nWe are all embodiments of the divine. AS such when we meet and greet each other by doing namaste we are asking the God in us to bless the other person and vice versa. ~Chella \nI honor the Divine within you. I honor the place in you that is of Light, of Love, of Truth and of Peace. When you are in that place in you, and I am in that place in me... We are one. ~Reiki by Rickie \nI honor and respect and thank myself for where my life is right now and in turn I honor, respect and thank you for being in my life at this time.~Susan \nI bow to you. Being Hindu--we do Namaskaar/Pranaams and touch ppl's feet that we honor/respect--elders, Guru, Husbands etc. etc. ~Nanda \nI have always thought it to mean \"the God in me recognizes and acknowledges the God in you. However, my teacher, Wendy Sue Wahl, adds the totality- Namaste Iammu- with Iammu meaning \"yielding into Truth\". This seems to allow the greeting to reach its highest height. ~Kimberly McCarty \nAccording to Hindu philosophy My Self and Higher Self both are one. ~Ashok Kumar Sharada \nI run an holistic keepfit class and the first thing we do is close our eyes and say namaste to ourselves to honour and recognize our own self worth.
