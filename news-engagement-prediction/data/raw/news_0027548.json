Competing for Minnetonka West on Saturday at the University of St. Thomas were Rory Cole, Aidan Barker, Elizabeth Morgan, Emily Nikas and Declan St. John. They were coached by Mitch Elvebak and Frederick Stock. The teams in the regional spent months prepping for the event that features head-to-head competition in a fast-paced question-and-answer format similar television’s “Jeopardy.” The students were quizzed on biology, chemistry, earth and space science, energy, math and physics. In the high school regional competition on Jan. 21, Edina (Team No. 1) repeated as winners and earned a trip to the National Science Bowl. The regional drew 38 teams to Macalester College in St. Paul. Heading to the national science showdown from Edina are Meghana Iyer, Mathew Zappa, Beining Zhang, Michael Tang and Robert Scalia.
