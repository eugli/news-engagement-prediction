President Donald Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway , denies that she was sidelined from making TV appearances. Watch the video above. \nCNN reported on Wednesday, February 22, that White House officials cut down Conway's interviews after she made multiple statements that contradicted Trump administration policies and stances. Hours later, Conway, 50, clapped back at the rumors during an appearance on Fox News' Hannity . First Kids Through the Years, From Alice Roosevelt to Barron Trump \n\"Somebody is trying to start up trouble,\" she told host Sean Hannity . \"I think there's some people trying to get in my way. I've also gobbled up a lot of other people’s TV opportunities, so there’s some resentment on the outside, I believe. And folks just trying to use me as clickbait in a headline. I'm there to serve the president, who is there to serve the American people. And I know very clearly what the portfolio includes, what I'm doing as a part of his senior team, and I'm comfortable with that.\" White House counselor Kellyanne Conway speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Oxon Hill, Md., Thursday, Feb. 23, 2017. AP Photo/Susan Walsh \nConway said that \"about five percent\" of her job involves appearing on TV and that Trump, 70, is his own best messenger. Stars Who Played the President \n\"I don't think I have to explain myself if I’m not going to go on TV for a week,\" she continued. \"If I’m out with four kids for three days looking at houses and schools — a lot of my colleagues aren’t trying to figure out how to be a mother of four kids, I assure you.\" You May Also Like", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:31:02.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
