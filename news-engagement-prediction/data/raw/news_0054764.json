Credit: UPS Smart Cities: Montreal \nOn Monday, a UPS drone buzzed over fields in Lithia, Florida, to deliver a test package to a rural home. \nIt was launched from the roof of a modified UPS truck and automatically returned to the vehicle after making its drop-off. The idea is that the driver can continue along his or her route while the drone makes a delivery that would otherwise be out of the way. \n“Imagine a triangular delivery route where the stops are miles apart by road. Sending a drone from a package car to make just one of those deliveries can reduce costly miles driven,\" said Mark Wallace, UPS senior vice president of global engineering, in a press release on Tuesday. \"This is a big step toward bolstering efficiency in our network and reducing our emissions at the same time.” [ Further reading: Here comes the drone backlash ] \nThis is not the first time UPS has experimented with drones. In September 2016, the company successfully used a drone to deliver medicine to an island near Boston. \nBut chances are that commercial drone deliveries are still a long way off due to regulation. According to FAA rules, a UPS driver would have to be able to watch the drone's whole flight, so it could be hard to save any driving or time.
