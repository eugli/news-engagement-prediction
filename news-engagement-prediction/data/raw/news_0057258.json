The teenagers in the water were all boys ages 13 to 17, according to ABC New York City station WABC-TV . \n“One of the first things I learned as a kid was never give your body to somebody drowning and I learned that the hard way,” Jonas said today on “GMA.” “The first two kids I got to heading into the water pulled me under. \n“They had me completely under the water,” he said. “I had to get them up and get them to [Ethan].” \nWhile other eyewitnesses captured Turnbull and Jonas’s heroic efforts on video, the two friends kept working to pull each of the seven boys to the shore. \n“The only time I was really scared was as I was entering the water … it was chaotic,” Jonas said. “They were pulling each other under [and] just knowing you’re heading into the middle of that and they’re trying to get out as much as you’re trying to get them out.” \nHe added, “You’re their way out so they’re trying to get on top of you, get out any way they can.” \nOne of the victims was hospitalized overnight. The other teens were treated and released, according to WABC. \nJonas and Turnbull were not injured during the rescue. Jonas described how the pair survived the “brutal” water temperature. \n“The adrenaline was so crazy; I don’t think either of us really realized how cold we were until after it all kind of subsided,” he said.\n  \nModels describe how they rescued teens from frozen Central Park pond   \nTop   \nDylann   \nMuslim   \" \nPolice: Suspects in N.
