La La Land wins five awards including best direction, best cinematography FP Staff Feb, 27 2017 10:13:05 IST \nOscar for Best Director goes to Damien Chazelle for La La Land \nDenis Villeneuve, Arrival \nDamien Chazelle, La La Land \nKenneth Lonergan, Manchester by the Sea \nBarry Jenkins, Moonlight Sneha Khale, Pop Culture Writer 10:15 (IST) \nDamien Chazelle becomes the youngest winner of the Best Director Oscar. Happy for him, but La La Land was perhaps not worth it. Mihir Fadnavis, Film Critic 10:14 (IST) \nCongratulations to Damien Chazelle who has pulled a Martin Scorsese at such a young age — winning the Best Director award for his worst film. Mihir Fadnavis, Film Critic 10:12 (IST) \nCongratulations to Moonlight for adapted screenplay. But I'll be honest — there are many things great in Moonlight, like performances, photography and direction. But writing isn't one of them. The third act is cloying, melodramatic and completely implausible. Mihir Fadnavis, Film Critic 10:10 (IST) \nKennth Lonergan looks as depressed as the people in his film. Much deserved win for Manchester By The Sea. 10:08 (IST) \nWhile we take a short break from the 89th Academy Awards ceremony, test your Oscars knowledge by taking this quick quiz: \nMeanwhile, praise for Jimmy Kimmel's hosting from Ellen DeGeneres: \nPeople are clearly loving this year's show! . @JimmyKimmel , you've got this job for life. #Oscars — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) February 27, 2017 10:05 (IST) \nOscar for Best Adapted Screenplay goes to Barry Jenkins for Moonlight \nArrival Sneha Khale, Pop Culture Writer 10:04 (IST) \nWhat a great throwback it was seeing Damon and Affleck on stage to present the Original Screenplay Oscar. Took me right back to this moment, 20 years ago: 10:03 (IST) \nAmong the fun moments on stage were when Matt Damon and Ben Affleck stepped on stage to present the Best Original Screenplay Oscar. Not only did host Jimmy Kimmel merely introduce them as \"Ben Affleck and Guest\", when Damon started to introduce the nominees, the orchestra began to play loud, drowning out his voice, even as he protested, \"I'm not even making an acceptance speech!\" 10:02 (IST) \nThe Oscar for the Best Original Screenplay goes to Kenneth Lonergan for Manchester by the Sea \nThe nominees were: 09:57 (IST) \nOf all the faces on screen in the 'In Memoriam' section, this one felt the most painful: Rest in peace, Anton Yelchin… #Oscars pic.twitter.com/7gT6aPIbiU — ABC News (@ABC) February 27, 2017 09:56 (IST) \nIn Memoriam \nThe 89th Academy Awards just paid a moving tribute to those form the film fraternity who passed away over the year gone by. \nAmong them were Carrie Fisher, Kenny Baker, Prince, Mary Tyler Moore, and Anton Yelchin. Mihir Fadnavis, Film Critic 09:52 (IST) \nThose celebrating La La Land 's music should go and watch these two films immediately: The Lure and Sing Street . 09:48 (IST) \nOscar for Best Original Song goes to 'City of Stars' from La La Land \n\" Audition: The Fools Who Dream \"— La La Land \n\"Can't Stop the Feeling\" — Trolls \n\"City of Stars\" — La La Land \n\"The Empty Chair\" — Jim: The James Foley Story \n\"How Far I'll Go\" — Moana \n...And the winner is: 'City of Stars' from La La Land 09:45 (IST) \nOscar for Best Original Score goes to Justin Hurwitz for La La Land \nNominees were: Ruchika Kher, Fashion Journalist 09:42 (IST) \nWhat an amazing performance by John Legend. ' City of Stars ' has got to be my favourite song from La La Land. Sneha Khale, Pop Culture Writer 09:37 (IST) \nLa La Land trivia: It was shot on film in a 2.55:1 ratio that required Panavision to build new ground glass for the lenses. I didn't know that; did you? Sneha Khale, Pop Culture Writer 09:36 (IST) \nArrival should've won for Cinematography! We've never seen aliens look like that. Or their spaceships. It was so beautiful! Mihir Fadnavis, Film Critic 09:35 (IST) \nI was personally siding with Bradford Young for Arrival for the Cinematography Oscar . Sci-fi has never looked so 'dirty'. 09:31 (IST) \nLinus Sandgren just won his first Oscar for Cinematography on La La Land . This is La La Land 's second Oscar win of the night. 09:29 (IST) \nOscar for Best Cinematography goes to Linus Sandgren for La La Land \nThe nominees included: \n...And the winner is: Linus Sandgren for La La Land 09:24 (IST) #Oscars audience stands in honor of the White Helmets, volunteers who assist wounded in Syrian war zones. https://t.co/fL66m3Sqn2 pic.twitter.com/kme6Bykt17 — ABC News (@ABC) February 27, 2017 09:22 (IST) \nStatement read on behalf of The White Helmets : Statement read on behalf of Raed Al Saleh, head of the White Helmets: \"Work on the side of life...stop the bloodshed in Syria.\" #Oscars pic.twitter.com/KlaAN5zR6v — ABC News (@ABC) February 27, 2017 09:21 (IST) \nAnd here's host Jimmy Kimmel taking a dig at Donald Trump: \nHe followed that up with \"Meryl says hi\"! Hey @realDonaldTrump u up? Mihir Fadnavis, Film Critic 09:20 (IST) \nThe White Helmets cinematographer Khalid Khateb was denied entry into the US . The film just won the Oscar. 09:18 (IST) \nOscar for Best Live-Action Short goes to Sing \nEnnemis Interieurs \nLa Femme et le TGV \nSilent Nights \n...And the winner is: Sing 09:17 (IST) \n#ICYMI — the Sunny Pawar-Jimmy Kimmel exchange: . @JimmyKimmel lifts 8-year-old \"Lion\" actor Sunny Pawar into the air in reenactment of \"Lion King\" scene. https://t.co/HnlDqe809w #Oscars pic.twitter.com/7S3YskFsLw — ABC News (@ABC) February 27, 2017 09:15 (IST) \nOscar for Best Documentary Short Subject goes to The White Helmets \nThe nominees are: \n...And the winner is: The White Helmets 09:13 (IST) \nAnd here's Sunny Pawar, charming all the guests as he recreates The Lion King pose with host Jimmy Kimmel.

Hosting the Oscars is a thankless job and previous hosts have faced so much criticism. Ellen DeGeneres (2007/2017) was too sweet and Neil Patrick Harris (2015) looked like he was trying to hard. But Kimmel is keeping the Oscars moving. Some credit to Matt Damon too. Their squabble made things interesting. “The #Oscars are about the movies and you can’t have movies without movie candy, it’s un-American.” - Jimmy #Kimmel #Oscars pic.twitter.com/YH5lMuyF1I — Jimmy Kimmel Live (@JimmyKimmelLive) February 27, 2017 09:01 (IST) \nOscar for Best Visual Effects goes to The Jungle Book \nNominees were: \nKubo and the Two Strings \nRogue One: A Star Wars Stor y \n...And the winner is: The Jungle Book 09:00 (IST) — World News Tonight (@ABCWorldNews) February 27, 2017 08:59 (IST) that awkward moment when you need to give a standing ovation but your nails are still wet pic.twitter.com/IR6p7HPTu6 Mihir Fadnavis, Film Critic 08:58 (IST) \nPrediction: Filmfare Awards are going to borrow the idea of 'common people' coming to the show and shaking hands with the stars. Nope, it's all scripted. Nikita Rana, Journalist/Writer 08:57 (IST) \nWhile we take a break from the proceedings, here's a graphic from The Guardian that I found really interesting. It asks, \"How out of touch are the Oscars?\" Here's the answer. \nDid Jimmy Kimmel just plagiarise a joke? Mashable thinks so: Jimmy Kimmel's joke sounded better when women did it first https://t.co/V1BKY0MSJx pic.twitter.com/zCtW4Ij1KC Ruchika Kher, Fashion Journalist 08:47 (IST) \nFinally, La La Land' s first win of the night for production design — although I expected it would win the sound mixing category for sure. 08:45 (IST) \nOscar for Production Design goes to La La Land \nThe nominees were: \nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them \nHail, Caesar! Mihir Fadnavis, Film Critic 08:44 (IST) \nWe'll just have to assume the makers of Zootopia saw Trump coming. A film that reflects the time that America lives in. Sneha Khale, Pop Culture Writer 08:43 (IST) \nZootopia most definitely deserved to win! It made a political statement in 2016 way before anyone/anything else did. Was such a terrific political allegory, disguised in cute Disney garb. 08:42 (IST) \nOscar for Best Animated Feature goes to Zootopia \nKubo and the Two Strings \nMoana \nMy Life as a Zucchini \nThe Red Turtle \n...And the winner is: Zootopia! 08:40 (IST) \nIf you are in that rare minority of people who hasn't watched the very anticipated sequel Finding Dory in the theatres yet, you missed an opportunity to watch one of Disney's most acclaimed shorts, the freshly released . http://www.firstpost.com \nOscar for Best Animated Short goes to Piper \nThe nominees included: Nikita Rana, Journalist/Writer 08:39 (IST) \nHow racially skewed are the Oscars? The Economist had some interesting data to present. Read the report here . Load More \nIn the pantheon of award shows that honour cinema the world over, there are few that match up to the Oscars in terms of glamour, hype or scale. \nAnd as the 89th Academy Awards — or the Oscars 2017 — kick off at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles (Sunday night, 26 February, in the US and Monday morning, 27 February for us folks in India), there's plenty of excitement over how the ceremony will play out. \nWill La La Land pull off a landslide sweep across all the major categories it's been nominated in? Will Emma Stone lift the coveted golden statuette as Best Actress? Will it come down to a Denzel Washington vs Casey Affleck fight for the Best Actor in a Leading Role prize? Will Dennis Villeneuve or Damien Chazelle earn the Best Director honour? \nWe've got some desi interest in the proceedings as well. Priyanka Chopra will be walking the red carpet; she announced her presence with an Instagram photo along with Sir Mick Jagger, which really had us wondering if they have some sort of joint performance/presentation at the Oscars 2017 ceremony. Then there's Dev Patel, who has a Best Supporting Actor for his role in Lion . Oscars 2017: Who will take home the coveted golden statuette? \nIf Patel has many expectations riding on his lean shoulders, so too does first-time host Jimmy Kimmel. Kimmel follows a tough act in the form of last year's host Chris Rock, who roasted the Academy over the #OscarsSoWhite controversy to great effect. Then there's former host Ellen DeGeneres, who has set the bar pretty high with her pizza-sharing, selfie-snapping ways. Kimmel had a goodish bit of experience with hosting the Emmys this year, which should stand him in good stead on the Oscars stage. \nThat stage could well be the spot where some pretty blistering anti-Donald Trump speeches are made. Meryl Streep set the tone with her Golden Globes acceptance speech, and Stranger Things star David Harbour and a host of other actors followed it up at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards. Who will get the loudest applause? \nAnd of course, when talking of applause and approval, we can't leave out the slightly less serious (but no less important) red carpet fashion. There will be some beautiful gowns, natty tuxedos and several bizarre sartorial statements made — there's no doubt. \nAnd we'll be keeping you posted on every little detail, minute-by-minute. \nStay tuned. We're live blogging the 89th Academy Awards, aka the Oscars 2017, right here.
