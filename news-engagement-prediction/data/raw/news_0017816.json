Hornsby South Dural development: council halts evaluation following New Line Rd traffic woes Jake McCallum, Hornsby Advocate February 9, 2017 3:24pm\nTHE FUTURE of South Dural is hanging in the balance after Hornsby Council decided to halt its evaluation of the planning proposal, to redevelop the suburb.\nCouncillors at Wednesday night’s meeting voted unanimously to see the assessment of the controversial development plan end, following a notice of motion put forward by Hornsby Mayor, Steve Russell.\n“From the very beginning we have been concerned by the increase in traffic this proposed development would cause, particularly on New Line Rd and Old Northern Rd which are already overburdened,” Cr Russell said.\n“We have always said that we will not allow this to move forward unless the government is by our side with infrastructure funding that will make it feasible.\n“There is still no certainty that funding will be provided and we are halting the process until it is forthcoming.\n“Housing affordability is at crisis point and more development is a major part of the solution, but that cannot possibly proceed unless the infrastructure is there to support it.\n“We know we are not alone in this view, as there were close to 5,000 submissions objecting to the proposal.”\nmedia_camera A public meeting over the proposed South Dural development drew 600 people to Cherrybrook Community Centre. media_camera Anti South Dural development signage in Galston.\nIn April last year, Former NSW Roads Minister, Duncan Gay was grilled by Cr Russell over gridlock on New Line Rd — sparking a corridor investigation.\n“We wrote to Mr Gay in December last year and his response explained that there was no money for the widening of the road,” Cr Russell said.\n“Initial costs for road widening at New Line Rd came back at around $158 million, but the findings of the RMS was not the same.\n“This is a road that is over capacity and government are putting their head in the sand over it, and it is our residents that suffer the consequences.”\nIn December, Cr Russell wrote to Mr Gay requesting an “urgent response” to confirm the NSW Government’s position concerning the expansion of New Line Rd.\nMr Gay acknowledged that road network upgrades are required, including works to New Line Road and Old Northern Road to a value of $158 million to support the proposal.\nHowever, Mr Gay noted, “that he has been advised that this figure is significantly lower than estimates by Roads and Maritime Services which indicate that the necessary road works will cost in excess of $300 million.”\nCr Russell said council is seeking an “urgent meeting” with the NSW Government and Hills Shire Council “to develop an infrastructure funding plan”.\nmedia_camera The South

developments to the west that place even more stress on our roads.\n“Therefore, council will ask the government not to progress any planning proposals in the Hills, Hawkesbury or Blacktown council areas that will increase traffic on the affected roads.”", "external_links": ["https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h",
