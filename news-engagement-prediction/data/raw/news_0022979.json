Me and Marnie, we re-create a sex scene that she had with Desi, and it was really weird.” \nBefore Williams chimed in to affirm that it will be \"evocative of that certain other situation.” \nIt'll be an interesting leap of lingus for Ray, who up until now has been the most sexually vanilla character of the bunch, opting for a more traditional bed game than his kinky companions. Even Karpovsky has described the upcoming scene as \"pretty out there for him,\" before stating that Shosh, who's far from being the most boom-boom-shake-the-room, led the way in his first on-screen sexy. \nIt would seem that rather than just bashing out another rimming scene for nostalgic fodder, this one is going to be a kind of \"remix\" with a \"totally different visceral energy,\" approached from a \"different angle.\" And that's cool with us — as long as it ain't a worm's eye view — which, Dunham being Dunham, it very well could be. \nCheck out the trailer for Girls' final season below: \nWould you love to see Ray in a super kinky sex scene?
