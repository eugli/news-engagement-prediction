Ranging from furious Twitter rants to quiet introspection, the rapper and designer’s mercurial tendencies drive so much of his ideas and inspirations. Which is why the music for his Yeezy Fall 2017 show today told of a man with love on his mind. Blaring an atmospheric and brooding interpolation of R&B crooner’s J. Holiday’s 2007 song, “Bed”—the original a sensual plea for a romp around, well, the obvious—West immediately had the audience at Pier 59 in its feelings. The-Dream’s bare, falsetto vocals ached as the song swelled to a triumphant peak—a crescendo that seemed to speak to West’s strong and most likely emotional return to New York Fashion Week after last season’s cataclysmic endeavor. After all, West has endured a spate of setbacks since: his wife’s alarming burglary at Paris Fashion Week in the fall and his own bout with exhaustion late last year. Love and (perhaps) growing his family were seemingly on his mind instead this season, offering West and the collection full of denim, suede booties, and insouciantly cool knitwear a new perspective. And while it was rumored West would be releasing a collaborative effort, “Lost Hills,” with Drake today, his “Bed” remix seemed to set the right tone, instead.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:12:42.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
