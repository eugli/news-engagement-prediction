This time the Delimara power station was not shut down meaning that the outage in Malta did not affect the whole country and power was restored to all areas when other energy systems at Delimara were switched on. \n\"The use of the interconnector is being kept as low as possible pending investigations by Enemalta in the terminal station in Ragusa. Unfortunately, if the problems persist we may have to reuse plants currently on cold stand-by at Marsa power station. In fact, an open cycle plant in Marsa had to be used this morning,\" Mr Mizzi said. « Malta newspapers review 13% of fruit and veg had excessive pesticides » Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=920672481&n=f616af8a' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=920672481&n=f616af8a' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
