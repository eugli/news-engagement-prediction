Such a response on the streets of Windsor amounts to overkill and a complete waste of taxpayers’ money. ‘There is more security than soldiers. We were happy to perform ceremonial duties without a police escort even when the IRA wanted to kill us. 'A couple of additional armed officers would have sufficed as a response to the IS threat, not this overkill. The MoS revealed last month the Changing the Guard no longer takes place on Saturdays in Windsor due to terror attack fears ‘The police like to be seen and get involved. But I think they forget who is paying for it. What’s the point of those community support officers in their highvisibility jackets and the ceremonial wardens? If this situation did turn lethal they wouldn’t be able to respond.’ The MoS revealed last month how the Changing the Guard no longer takes place on Saturdays in Windsor because police believe jihadis could target soldiers and the thousands of tourists who gather to enjoy the spectacle. The move follows the IS attack on a Christmas market in Berlin, which killed 12 people, and the terror strike in Nice last July when 86 people died. When we attended the Changing the Guard on Friday, roads surrounding Windsor Castle were blocked by police cars, and armed officers took up positions on street corners before any soldiers even emerged from their barracks. Community support officers also lined the pavements and ceremonial wardens put out bollards. Finally, at just after 10.45am, the regimental band of the Irish Guards began to play inside Victoria Barracks. Police, flanked by vans filled with ammunition, watch over the ceremony Moments later 14 bandsmen playing pipes and drums and 14 guardsmen carrying assault rifles emerged. Police officers set off in an armed response vehicle ahead of the procession while another vehicle brought up the rear. A crowd of around 500 tourists cheered and clapped as the troops arrived at Windsor Castle a few minutes later. The old Guard was then escorted back to barracks. Thames Valley Police said: ‘Security measures have been put in place to reassure and increase the safety of the public and military. ‘The number of officers at the events has been increased along with reinforced road closures. The increased presence in police officers follows the review of our support to the Guard Change and is not directly linked to any increases in threat.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:48:16.500+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
