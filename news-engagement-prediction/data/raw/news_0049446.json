Trump has heavily criticized that finding and vowed to fight the case in court, but has also indicated that he may simply rewrite the order to make it more legally defensible. \nThe ban was criticized by even some of Trump’s supporters for being rolled out abruptly and with poor guidance from the administration. This resulted in many people being stranded at airports across the country as the details were sorted out, and that in turn caused protests and outrage among his critics. \nA poll recently found that more Americans support the travel ban than oppose it, although the level is just below a majority.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T09:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:13:51.299+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
