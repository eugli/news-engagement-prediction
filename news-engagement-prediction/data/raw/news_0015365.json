The Blues are currently sat nine points clear at the top of the Premier League and his style of football and has got fans and pundits purring. \nSo what on earth could make him want to leave? How about a salary of £13million-per-season? \nItalian giants Inter Milan are said to be targeting a move for the former national team boss, and are willing to pay him handsomely for the privilege. Article continues below \nAt least that's according to Tuttosport , who claim that the club's new Chinese owners have identified him as the ideal man to get the club back on track following years of disappointment. \nOnce one of Italy's most feared and revered sides, Inter have sunk to become a club mired in mid-table mediocrity, and the new owners are looking to get the team back to where they should be.
