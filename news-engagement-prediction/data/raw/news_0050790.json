Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo Supported by Alfonso Montero Tuesday 21 February 2017 08.40 GMT \nO ver the course of the EU referendum debate, immigration took centre stage as people grappled with claims and counterclaims about the extent to which British society has changed due to the number of migrants coming to work and live in the UK. \nCitizens from other EU countries are an important part of the UK workforce , accounting for one in 15 workers. They also contribute a sizeable amount to the economy, having paid £2.5bn more in income tax and national insurance than they received in tax credits or child benefits in 2013-14, for example. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that their labour contribution helps grow the economy by an additional 0.6% a year. Brexit would be bad for the NHS and social care Read more \nSome sectors of the economy are more heavily dependent on the skills EU citizens bring than others, as is the case in social services. Studies from Ireland and the UK indicate that foreign-qualified social workers constitute up to 20% of the workforce. Social care relies even more on non-UK nationals to keep services working. Nearly one in five care workers were born outside of the UK (approximately 266,000 people), of whom 28% were born in the EU. There was a particularly sharp increase in the number of migrant workers in the social care sector between 2011 and 2015: 40% of EU workers arrived during this period. \nIt is clear that migrant workers play a key role in the social services workforce in the UK. They are efficient, talented, caring and skilled professionals, who have gone through an open, competitive recruitment process for their jobs. They are the candidates with the greatest skills and the right attitudes to take on work that may be low-paid and is often hard. Contrary to the claim that immigration puts a strain on public services, the fact is that older people, and those with disabilities or mental health problems, would not be receiving the same level of service without these professionals from the rest of Europe. Economic migrants cannot be stealing jobs in a sector facing a much-publicised recruitment crisis. \nLeaving the EU could mean that recruitment into the sector will become even harder. The recruitment of younger workers is crucial, but leaving the EU could make a career in social services even less attractive than it is now, with fewer jobs in cash-stripped services. Second, it would potentially expose low paid workers to even poorer working conditions, as the UK would not be bound by EU employment laws. Third, the UK’s social policy sector will face policy isolation, with fewer dedicated resources or opportunities to research, learn and share. Lessons from Europe: how projects supporting care leavers are transforming lives Read more \nFinally, a significant number of European funding streams, such as the European Social Fund (ESF), are used to fund employment and social services-related projects, notably for vulnerable groups. Renfrewshire council in Scotland, for instance, has been using the ESF to extend the implementation of Project Search – an employability scheme for people with learning disabilities. The decision to leave the EU questions the future availability (pdf) of these grants. There needs to be an immediate assessment of EU grant funding availability and the impact of their withdrawal on vulnerable groups, such as older people with complex needs and people with disabilities.
