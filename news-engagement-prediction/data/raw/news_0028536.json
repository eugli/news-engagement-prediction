YouTube/Apple \nApple released its first teaser for its \"Carpool Karaoke\" show on Sunday night during the Grammy Awards, The Verge reports . \nThe trailer , which you can view in full below, shows a range of guests for the show, including Metallica, Will Smith, Alicia Keys, John Legend, and Ariana Grande. \nApple bought the rights to \"Carpool Karaoke\" from James Corden's \"Late Late Show\" last year. \nCorden's segment followed the same format every time: Corden drove around in a car with a famous musician, and they sang the musician's songs together. \nBut it looks like Apple plans to shake that format up. First of all: Corden won't host every episode. The trailer shows guest hosts including Shaquille O’Neal and Billy Eichner. And this series isn't sticking to cars, either. Smith and Corden can briefly be seen in a helicopter flying past the Hollywood sign. \nThere's no concrete release date included in Apple's trailer — it just says that the series is \"coming soon\" on Apple Music.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:14:28.533+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
