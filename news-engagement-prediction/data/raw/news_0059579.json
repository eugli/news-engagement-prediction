In it, they requested the Transit Administration put Caltrain funding on hold while officials conducted a full audit of the high-speed rail system. \n“It puts the [electrification] project in serious jeopardy,” Caltrain spokesperson Seamus Murphy told SFGate. \nAccording to state transportation officials, electrification of Caltrain would increase ridership and lessen the cost of operation. The current trains operate on diesel, are slow, and expensive to run. \nThe controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 10 show all The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued 1/10 Trump and abortion Protesters flood Independence Avenue during the Women's March\nGetty\n2/10 Trump and abortion US President Donald Trump signs an executive order as Chief of Staff Reince Priebus looks on in the Oval Office of the White House\nGetty Images\n3/10 Trump and 'Obamacare' Nancy Pelosi who is the minority leader of the House of Representatives speaks beside House Democrats at an event to protect the Affordable Care Act in Los Angeles, California.

But Caltrain has a 1 March deadline to issue contracts for electrification. \nTransit agency director Matthew Welbes said in his letter to Caltrain officials that they were aware of the upcoming deadline, but required “additional time to complete review of this significant commitment of federal resources”.\nDelaying the funding would all but stop the project in its tracks, as Caltrain would need the help of federal funding to meet the budget for the $1.98bn modernisation project. \nSean Spicer says President Trump sees transgender bathrooms is a states' rights issue “I never imagined that the electrification of a train would be subjected to such brutal partisan politics,” Democratic Rep Anna Eshoo said. “This is not a Democratic project, nor is it a Republican project. \n“It is about the modernisation of an outdated commuter system that is the spine of the transportation system of the Peninsula and the Silicon Valley region.”\nMs Eshoo, whose district includes Palo Alto, which contains numerous Caltrain stations, said that Caltrain electrification “is a shovel-ready project which would create thousands of jobs in the Bay Area and employ thousands in other states. It would be built by American workers and built with American products.”\nRead more As California drought eases, farmers fret over regulations California rushes to counter Trump's assault on sanctuary cities California considers 'sanctuary state' plan in defiance of Trump The halt of the project seems to contradict what President Trump’s vow to improve American infrastructure, but is consistent with criticisms that he is friendly the oil and gas lobby. \nBut Mr Trump, who is know for his value of loyalty and recoils at criticism, has struck a major blow to Gov Jerry Brown, who has openly criticised the President on his controversial policies – including health care, immigration, and the environment.\n“This morning, it’s hard for me to keep my thoughts just on California,” Mr Brown said during his State of the State address last month. “We’ve seen the bald assertion of ‘alternative facts’, whatever those are. We’ve heard the blatant attacks on science. \n“Familiar signposts of our democracy – truth, civility, working together – have been obscured or even swept aside.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:29:21.630+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
