Turner courtesy Chris Bosh has committed to working in TNT's studio. Chris Bosh has committed to working in TNT's studio. (Turner courtesy) Ira Winderman will not attempt to resume his NBA career this season, TNT announced Thursday that the Miami Heat power forward will serve as a studio analyst for five consecutive Mondays starting next week.\nThe timing of Bosh's commitment is the strongest indication that Bosh does not plan to return to the court this season, and possibly is seeking other career avenues going forward. \nBosh's studio commitment therefore precludes the possibility of Bosh appearing in 25 games this season (regular season and playoffs). That is significant, because if the Heat, as expected, apply to remove Bosh's salary-cap hit going forward, his salary would revert to the Heat if he hits that 25-game threshold in any of the remaining three seasons on his contract. \nBosh has been away from the Heat since failing his preseason physical, after missing the second half of the previous two seasons due to blood clots. \nThe Heat are expected to move forward with their case for such cap relief during the same time frame that Bosh will be working on Turner's Monday doubleheader broadcasts.

Chris is still deeply connected with today's NBA players and his insights into the game will further enhance the experience for our viewers.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:01:47.582+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
