Your rights if your flight has been delayed or cancelled - here's what you should do \nIF your flight’s been cancelled or delayed because of Storm Doris then it's crucial that you know your rights, so that you don’t end up out of pocket. Under EU rules if your flight is cancelled at short notice then they should give you a full refund or offer suitable alternative travel. If your flight is delayed then you are only entitled to compensation if the delay was caused by something within the airline’s control. Extraordinary circumstances aren’t covered but you should still try and ask the airline if they will compensate you. If your departure is delayed for over five hours then you can choose not to travel and get a refund.
