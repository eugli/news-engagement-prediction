I want to put in a good performance and win that game and that’s all I’ll be thinking about. \n“There’ll be no chat to be honest. It will be head down and we’ll resume the friendship after the game. They’ll be doing their best to win that game ... as will I.” \nFarah was reluctant to answer questions relating to the Tigers when he fronted media at Redfern Oval on Thursday. \nHe said he didn’t want to discuss his “ex girlfriend”. \n“I don’t want to talk about that ex girlfriend,” Farah said.

My old man grew up a Bunnie fan so he gets to come back to his traditionalk club.” \nDo you live in Queensland? Want to meet a bunch of NRL legends and talk footy with them?
