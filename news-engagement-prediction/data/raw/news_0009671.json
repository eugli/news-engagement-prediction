The brief video of the trio hyping their hometown squad up came complete with subtitles, perhaps for those unaccustomed to their deep southern accents. \n“We ’bout to pipe this up, first off,” said Offest leading off, with Quavo taking up the slack with, “This one right here for all the marbles, we bringing the goose back.” \nOffset had an especially passionate message for quarterback Matt Ryan, urging him to make standout wide receiver Julio Jones a focal point in tonight’s offensive scheme. Devonta Freeman was next mentioned by the gruff-voiced rapper with Takeoff finalizing things with, “It’s a team, y’all didn’t get here with one player.” \nPretty much like the Migos, one might say. \nThe crew has also been active in other Super Bowl-related activities, including an NFL fan event where the boys ran a 40-yard dash and met with Dallas Cowboys legend Emmitt Smith.
