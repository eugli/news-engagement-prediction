Dame Quentin Bryce, an advocate of the program \nFormer governor-general Dame Quentin Bryce, who is a past presenter at the program, said it was a wonderful opportunity to engage with emerging leaders. \n\"I feel a deep sense of responsibility to be encouraging the talented, highly qualified, motivated women in our community to get in there and make a difference and to see that women's voices are heard,\" she said. \nWhile Dame Quentin admitted that a life in politics wasn't the easiest career path to take, she believes it's extremely fulfilling. \n\"Of course it's hard, it's tough and in some ways it's getting harder. I think we should stop complaining about it so much and look at ways of improving, enriching, enhancing our democracy.\" Breaking down the barriers \nDr Carson believes the very nature of Australian politics is male dominated. \n\"Labor has tended to go up in its level of representation of women, the Liberal parties have been on a downward decline since the Howard era of 1996,\" she said.

(ABC News: Rebecca Keating) \n\"The difficulties are the well-worn path that politics can be a real boys club, that men can be very effective at networking and women can get shut out of those.\" \nHowever, she is hopeful that through the Pathway to Politics initiative, women will be empowered to pursue a life in politics. \n\"Women obviously have great skills to offer to the political sphere and we're doing everything possible to ensure that we can help women who are interested in having a political career have those skills and connect with the networks that they need to,\" she said. \nThrough this course, Dr Carson was driven to try and address the increasing female deficit in Australia's parliaments. \n\"If you look at the statistics over time, women's participation is declining rather than increasing in certain subsets, and the Liberal Party at a federal level is one where there's a marked decline,\" she said. \n\"Australia is made up of 50 per cent women, 50 per cent men; a strong parliament should represent that.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:03:34.013+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
