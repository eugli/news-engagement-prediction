Access to the House network was terminated for the five employees — four men and a woman — on Thursday afternoon but it’s up to individual lawmakers to fire the staffers in question, according to a senior House official. The official said most members are proceeding with termination.\n \nThe staffers have not been arrested.\nAll lawmakers targeted by the alleged scam were victims and had no idea what potential crimes were being committed by their employees, House sources said.\nThe identities of the staffers are still unknown but the official said they are shared House employees, meaning they work for multiple members, not contractors. \n1600 Penn \nTrump’s Enemies Within By John F. Harris and Daniel Lippman \nBuzzFeed News first reported the incident. However, the senior House official disputed some of the details in the story. \nMore than 20 members were victimized by the alleged procurement scam and chiefs of staff for the lawmakers were briefed on the matter Thursday.\nA source in the briefing said the Sergeant at Arms confirmed the U.S. Capitol Police is conducting an active criminal investigation but said no arrests have been made. The source said the FBI is not involved in the investigation.\nThe Capitol police did not return a request for comment.\nThe employees allegedly stole equipment from members' offices without their knowledge and committed serious, potentially illegal, violations of House IT policies.\nHouse sources stressed the investigation, which has been ongoing since late 2016, is focused on equipment theft and not a network hacking issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:44:45.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
