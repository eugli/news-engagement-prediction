Such people will disproportionately be from more deprived areas and manual occupations, while those benefiting most will be the relatively prosperous.\n“By 2020 the state pension will be at a level where it will provide a decent minimum income for people in retirement to underpin private saving, and any savings they have will be kept on top of, not clawed back from, the state pension.\n“The triple lock will have done its job and it will be time therefore to retire it.”\nPA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:41:17.854+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
