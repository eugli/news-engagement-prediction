But the combined $75,000 donated by Plank's Under Armour and Bisciotti's Baltimore Ravens to the \"Bake Sale for Buses\" effort will allow city school students to ride Maryland Transit Administration buses for free until 8 p.m. this year. The fundraising effort, led by City Council members Zeke Cohen and Kisterfer Burnett, also raised $26,000 from individual donors. The goal was $100,000.

Many found themselves having to find rides and money for bus fare threatened when the MTA and the school system no longer kept up a deal to make the rides free from 5 a.m. until 8 p.m. The S-pass was free for students only until 6 p.m under the new deal created last year. \"It's been a big burden to me, my family and coaches,\" Raekwon Redding , captain of the City Neighbors High School basketball team, said at a news conference Tuesday to announce the $50,000 gift by Under Armour (NYSE: UAA) and $25,000 by the Ravens. The conference was led by Cohen, a first district council member. Cohen ended the news conference by saying the money raised to save the buses this year won't be enough to keep students riding for free in years to come. \"We do not want to be back here next year having a Bake Sale for Buses,\" Cohen said. Cohen said a \"conversation\" needs to take place between the MTA and Baltimore City Public Schools. He said that the community support for the free buses shows the importance of ensuring kids have access to after-school activities. \"We can’t do it through private philanthropy moving forward,\" he said.
