In 2017, select participating museums may offer special activities in addition to free access to temporary and permanent exhibits. Last year, the McCord Museum organized free afternoon concerts outside its doors during the afternoon and the Redpath Museum offered kids the chance to make their own fossil replica from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. \nFree Shuttle Buses and Museum Routes \nEvery year, five or more museum routes are set up for the public's convenience. Free shuttle service is available for each route, with buses leaving the same central terminal location every 10 to 25 minutes, depending on the route and depending on the year (time delays fluctuate from year to year; in 2016 buses are expected to run every 20 minutes). \nThe shuttle bus central departure location is near Place-des-Arts Metro's Jeanne-Mance exit, on the edge of Place des Festivals at the corner of Jeanne-Mance and de Maisonneuve ( map ). The public can also use the STM network with regular prices in effect . \nPlan Ahead: Pick Two Circuits Max, But Not More \nChances are you won't be able to visit all participating museums so consider picking your top two favorite museum circuits ahead of time or create your own museum circuit. \nBeat the Lineups \nIf you plan on taking advantage of the free bus shuttles and also want to avoid losing part of your day waiting in a long lineup, avoid the central departure location. Instead, plan the beginning of your day at the first stop of a given route (e.g., McCord Museum of the 2008 Montreal Museums Yellow Route ) where bus lineups are generally shorter. \n\nVisit the Montreal Museums Day website for a complete list of participating museums, museum routes and activities. \n\n*It's not entirely clear if 1987 was in fact Montreal Museums Day's debut year. The Board of Montreal Museum Directors published a report in 2005 stating the event's debut year was 1986, leading to some confusion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:43:42.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
