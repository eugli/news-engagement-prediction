Sikka said Infosys has received over 12,000 suggestions from employees on making the campuses safer. \n\n“We must ensure that all employees, in particular women, feel safe on our campuses. As I have always said, women are an absolutely critical part of the transformation of Infosys, and we will not rest until we have created an environment in which women, and everyone, can bring their incredible and unique talents and points of view, where they can thrive and grow into leadership roles, and where they feel safe and secure to do their work freely and without fear,” Sikka said.
