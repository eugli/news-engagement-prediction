Unfortunately I never got his name so hopefully you can pass this onto him and tell him how grateful we were.” \nSpeaking to The Huffington Post UK , Walker said: “I was really surprised how great he was with my son Alistair. \n“When we got to the checkout and Alistair noticed him he just kept shouting and waving. The staff member then put his arms out for him to take Alistair and I couldn’t believe what he was doing. \n“Alistair was totally fixated on the scanning and just thought I’d capture it.” \nThe video has had more than 7,000 likes and 500 shares in the four days since it was posted. \n“This is fantastic and it’s certainly brought a smile to our face here in the office,” an M&S spokesperson replied on Facebook . \n“ It looks like your little one was having a great time and it’s really good to see how our colleague was so helpful and interactive with our customers. \n“I’ll make sure this is shared on our internal employee page and that our store manager gets to hear about it too! We can then give him the recognition he deserves.” Also on HuffPost Celebrity Babies Born In 2017 Celebrity Babies Born In 2017 1 9 January 2017: Janet Jackson and Wissam Al Man Janet Jackson gave birth to her first child with her husband Wissam Al Man on Tuesday 3 January.
