Vaughn Correctional Center outside Smyrna, Del. All Delaware prisons went on lockdown Wednesday after hostages were taken there. Credit Suchat Pederson/The Wilmington News-Journal, via Associated Press Inmates were holding four people hostage at a Delaware prison on Wednesday in a standoff that began in the morning and continued into the evening, and left at least one prison employee injured, officials said. The hostages were taken at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center, near the town of Smyrna, between Wilmington and Dover. It is the state’s largest prison, with 2,500 inmates in minimum-, medium- and maximum-security units. At 10:32 a.m., “a correctional officer made a radio call for immediate assistance from within C Building, which houses over 100 inmates,” Sgt. Richard Bratz of the Delaware State Police said at a brief news conference. The building houses maximum-security inmates who are making the transition to medium security. Other correction officers responded to the distress call, and the prison was placed on lockdown, but inmates took five employees hostage. At about 2:40 p.m., one hostage was set free and taken by ambulance to a hospital, Sergeant Bratz said, “with nonlife-threatening injuries.” The News Journal newspaper reported that a woman had called its newsroom, stated that she was a hostage and haltingly read a statement that she said had been given to her by the inmates, complaining of mistreatment. She said the prisoners had forbidden her to give her name, and when asked how many inmates were holding her, she said she did not know because “they’ve got my face covered.” \nAdvertisement Scores of law enforcement officers in riot gear, with armored vehicles, gathered around the prison’s buildings.
