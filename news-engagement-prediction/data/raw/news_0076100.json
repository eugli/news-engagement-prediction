The Lightning will retain 20-percent of Bishop’s cap hit according to Rosen. \n\n— Elliotte Friedman (@FriedgeHNIC) February 26, 2017 \nThe Lightning’s all-time leader in regular-season wins, Bishop was last season’s Vezina Trophy runner-up as the league’s best goaltender. It had been rumored for quite some time the Lightning were shopping Bishop while he split time this season with up-and-coming goalie Andrei Vasilevsky. \nWith the addition of Bishop and the return of the Kings’ two-time Stanley Cup winning Jonathan Quick, the Kings tandem of goalies rivals the best the NHL has seen in quite sometime. \nIncluded in the trade, Budaj had filled in admirably for Quick in the latter’s 60 game absence but Bishop provides a serious upgrade in cause Quick suffers any subsequent injuries. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:46:50.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
