Woman claims she is actually a cat \n  Thomas Dishaw Tags: cat women , mental issues , trans-species , transgender \n( Natural News ) Who didn’t see this coming? Nano, a 20-year-old from Oslo, Norway claims to be “trans-species” and is actually a cat. Much like transgender people, she believes she was born this way and was assigned the wrong species at birth. Nano finally came to terms with the mistake when she was 16 and has lived as a cat ever since. In one of her YouTube videos, she claims “I realized I was a cat when I was 16 when doctors and psychologists found out what was ‘the thing’ with me. Under my birth, there was a genetic defect.” \nWhat qualifies Nano as a cat? Well, she claims that she naturally hisses at dogs, hates water, and has a superior sense of smell. She can see in the dark and likes to chase mice for fun, although she has not been able to catch any. She speaks mostly in “meows” especially to her friend Sven. Sven is not trans-species but claims to have different personalities, one of which is a cat, so he and Nano can communicate when they speak as cats. You can’t make this stuff up.

Family Research Council’s Peter Sprigg pointed out to LifeSiteNews , “Given today’s ‘identity politics,’ I would not be surprised if she is serious. Of course, the temptation is to say, ‘This is obviously ridiculous.’ You could look at the makeup of her DNA and at the anatomy of her body and know that she is a human being, not a cat. But the exact same thing could be said about a man who claims to be a woman (or vice versa), and yet today’s political correctness dictates that we treat the latter claim with deadly earnestness.” \nNano expects people to treat her like a cat, whatever that means. Maybe someone will do us all a favor and pick her up to take her to the pound for euthanization. \nNano, of course, is not alone. There are many people out there that firmly believe they are dragons , wolves, dogs, you name it, and they expect to be treated as such by society and demand respect for their movement. \nStories like this are the reason why so many of us fight against the transgender movement . It is not because we are hateful people, it is to prevent this kind of insanity. These people are suffering from mental disorders, and they need serious help. Trying to change the laws to normalize their way of thinking is not the right answer. Whatever people want to do is their prerogative, but when we start putting laws in place that force the majority of the public to suffer, that is a problem. \nTransgender is just the tip of the iceberg . There is a 50-year-old man that identifies as a 6-year-old girl , and even got adopted by a family. There are people who want to amputate healthy limbs because their image of themselves is as an amputee. I guess if I rob a bank I’ll just claim to be trans-rich and should be exempt from punishment since I was born that way. \nConservatives and libertarians need to continue to lobby our lawmakers and protest these movements; otherwise, if we leave it up to liberals we’re headed towards pure societal madness. \nSources", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T06:01:25.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
