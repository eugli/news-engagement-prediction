(Vision courtesy: ABC News 24) More videos Refugee deal to start in 'months' \nThe Nauru and Manus Island transfers to the US are due start in 'a couple of months', says Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, despite hesitations from US President Donald Trump. \nSince agreeing last year to take an unknown number of Central American refugees from camps in Costa Rica, the Turnbull government has denied it has engaged in a people swap with the US, akin to Labor's doomed 2011 arrangement with Malaysia. \nUpon announcing in November a deal for the US to resettle refugees from Manus Island and Nauru, Mr Dutton bluntly said: \"The Costa Rica arrangement had nothing to do with this deal and it's not a people swap.\" SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link A war of words has erupted over whether Australia's refugee deal with the US is a \"people swap\". Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nBut on Tuesday, he explicitly linked the two arrangements by insisting Australia would not take any refugees from Costa Rica until the US had taken people from Manus and Nauru. While declining to use the term \"people swap\" himself, he said he was happy for others to use that description. \n\"That's not the way I would categorise it,\" Ms Bishop responded from Washington. \"We are seeking to resettle a number of people who came via the people-smuggling trade . . . with the US. But we will continue to take refugees from across the world, as we've always done.\" Advertisement \nOther ministers, including Special Minister of State Scott Ryan and Veterans Affairs Minster Dan Tehan, refused to use the term \"people swap\", stressing that both Australia and the US retained the right to refuse any particular people into their respective countries. \nMr Dutton also appeared to back-track on Wednesday, telling Triple M: \"It's a separate arrangement and that's appropriate. But it's part of a broader relationship.\" \nGovernment sources indicated they understood a people swap to be a one-for-one or one-for-many agreement, whereas the Australia-US arrangement has no fixed numbers. Instead, this was a quid-pro-quo matter of mutual assistance between allies. \nAsked if Mr Turnbull had raised the Costa Rica quid-pro-quo in his infamous phone call with Mr Trump in January, a spokeswoman for the PM declined to comment, but referred to Mr Turnbull's earlier remarks about having stood up for Australia's interests. \nAnnouncing the Costa Rica deal in September, Mr Turnbull said: \"The announcement today is not connected to any other arrangements.\" Technically, however, no \"other arrangements\" existed at that time, as the Manus/Nauru deal was announced in November. \nLabor rounded on Mr Dutton on Wednesday, suggesting he had \"belled the cat\" on the doubts that linger over the agreement under US President Donald Trump, who is openly hostile to accepting Muslim refugees and hostile to the deal itself, which he has labelled \"dumb\". \nShadow immigration spokesman Shayne Neumann accused Mr Dutton of making a \"dangerous and reckless\" threat by suggesting Australia would not honour the Costa Rica agreement unless the US acted first. \nLabor frontbencher Richard Marles, a former immigration spokesman, said Mr Dutton had revealed a secret \"deal\" existed all along. \"Everyone in the industry knows that this has been the case, everyone in the sector, and now Peter Dutton has made it clear,\" he said. \nIn his interview with Sky News ' Andrew Bolt, Mr Dutton expressed confidence that resettlement in the US would begin in \"a couple of months\" - a speedier timetable than first thought.
