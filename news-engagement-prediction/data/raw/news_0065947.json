Credit Guillermo Arias/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images To the Editor: Re “ More Immigrants Face Deportation Under New Rules ” (front page, Feb. 22): To accommodate business interests, our government mostly looked the other way for decades while up to 11 million immigrants settled into jobs our citizens didn’t want. Now, to satisfy a presidential campaign promise playing to America’s worst fears, we are terrorizing these contributors to our economy and breaking up families. Given that employers must certify worker eligibility under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, I suspect that only collusion or tacit government approval explains how we accumulated so many illegal foreign workers in the first place. Deporting dangerous criminals is one thing, but let’s not kid ourselves about the role that most of the people being demonized fill in our society. Given that President Trump’s own businesses have needed to import help, why can’t our representatives address this issue honestly and intelligently to achieve win-win outcomes for both employers and people simply seeking a better life? KATHLEEN CLARK Doylestown, Pa. To the Editor: I am a member of the National Guard and a lawyer practicing immigration law in Minnesota. In 2013, President Obama, at the express request of the Defense Department, created a program for military families to prevent the deportation of military spouses, parents and children. This program alleviated a major source of anxiety and fear for service members and their families. I have personally experienced the hardship of deployments to combat zones, and know the incredible importance of family stability during that trying time. This week, this administration rescinded the Parole in Place program, harming thousands of military families across the country. This is another example of the careless excess of the administration’s immigration policy. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story It is unconscionable to reverse a policy that strengthens our military and our veterans. That the program was not even named in the memo demonstrates either a lack of awareness, or worse, a casual disregard of the effect that this will have on those most vulnerable members of our military. DAVID KUBAT Lino Lakes, Minn. To the Editor: Are we naïve enough to believe that the deportation police will assume the burden of proving that those they round up are undocumented? I don’t think so. It’s far more likely that those who are detained will have to prove that they have the right to stay here, that they are either citizens or permanent residents. We should expect the net to be cast so wide that anyone could be stopped on the street and asked for papers. Those without papers may spend a long time in detention.
