Police also seized thousands of dollars worth of drugs, weapons and jewelry. \nRichardson faced 13 charges in connection with that raid, including a first-degree murder charge. \nSparks-MacKinnon faced a first-degree murder charge along with two other counts of second-degree murder and three more counts of attempted murder. \nThe new charges were laid last week, but police released the information on Tuesday.
