She works at a Lethbridge printing shop and decided this year she would give Pink Shirt Day a local spin. \n“I figured we could start #bekindyql, ” Corraza said. “No one has used that hashtag and on the shirt it says: ‘You can sit with us.'” Story continues below \nShe thought a few of her friends would buy the anti-bullying shirts and that would be it, but she has sold hundreds. \nThe shirts are $15 each and money raised goes to Beauty From the Inside Out . The Lethbridge-based program teaches girls confidence, self respect and leadership. A spot in the program costs $500 per girl. \nWATCH: Pink Shirt Day – anti-bullying awareness day in Alberta \n“To have (money raised) going to sponsor the young women that attend my program… The schools or families that call me and say: ‘Hey, I want my daughter to be apart of this but I can’t afford it…’ \n“I’m super excited that I have to means and the opportunity to say: ‘Yes, you can because this community loves your kid,” said Ranae Peterson, an organizer with Beauty from the Inside Out. \nCorraza had high hopes but the community’s response blew her away. \nAs national anti-bullying day approaches, she is busy printing more shirts. \n“My heart is full… It’s really good and it’s really rewarding,” Corraza said. “I’m excited for the final outcome to see what we as a community can do for this organization.” © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
