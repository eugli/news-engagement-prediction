The decision comes shortly after a judge out of Boston ruled in favor of Trump's ban. USA TODAY NETWORK\nEditorial: Donald Trump was sent to obliterate the status quo in D.C. But there are lines even his supporters know he shouldn't cross. Donald Trump (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP)\n175 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 26 COMMENT EMAIL MORE “For Pete's sake, give the guy a chance. If he screws up big time, have at him!”\n- From an Arizona Republic reader\nWe got the above letter to the editor this weekend from a man upset at our criticism of Donald Trump. Many of our longtime readers who voted for Trump believe our critiques of the president represent a strong leftward tilt of the newspaper.\nWe’ve responded that it can look that way because Donald Trump has shaken the foundation of our national politics. The old left-right paradigm is cracking, the work of a new president who rejects the dogma of both major parties and believes Washington, D.C., has become an ungovernable fortress of self-serving elitists.\nEDITORIAL: President Donald Trump, our commander in chaos\nTrump was sent to Washington to obliterate the status quo.\nDozens of right-wing columnists who in normal years would defend the conservative-party president are this year blistering him. George Will, Charles Krauthammer, Jennifer Rubin, Jonah Goldberg, Mona Charen, Ross Douthat, Jay Nordlinger, Michael Gerson, Ben Shapiro and others are not closing ranks behind the Trump revolution.\nTo understand why, you need to understand that Trump is not just attacking political opponents, but the foundations of a free society. He has now attacked the independent judiciary, the free press, the electoral system and the U.S. intelligence community.\nThe tweet storm that proves the rule Just this past weekend, Trump used the stature of the White House to unleash a social-media storm against the federal judge who ruled against his executive order on immigration:\n5:12 a.m., Feb. 4\n“The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!”\n12:44 p.m., Feb. 4\n“What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?”\n1:44 p.m., Feb. 4\n“Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision”\n12:39 p.m., Feb 5\n“Just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. If something happens blame him and court system. People pouring in. Bad!”\nThis is the guy Trump attacked? Frame grab of U.S. District Judge James L. Robart presiding during State of Washington vs. Donald J. Trump, et al on Friday, Feb. 2, 2017 at the Seattle Federal Courthouse. Judge Robart ordered a national halt to President Trump's travel ban on people from seven countries. [Via MerlinFTP Drop] (Photo: United States Courts)\nThe “so-called” judge that Trump attacked and set up to be the fall guy for the next terror strike on America is a highly respected Republican jurist appointed by President George W. Bush.\nJames Robart, who serves on the Federal District Court in Seattle, is described as highly qualified and no-nonsense by both left and right, the New York Times reports.\n\"A smart, thoughtful guy and very even-tempered,” former U.S attorney and Republican Michael D. McKay. “The cream rises to the top.”\nREAD: The federal judge's ruling on Trump's immigration ban\n“(He’s) a very strict federal judge who believes in the rule of law,” said Jenny A. Durkan, a former U.S. attorney in the Obama administration. “I think he truly believes in the independence of the judiciary, to the marrow of his bones.”\nJudge Robart now faces a president of the United States attacking his authority and his credibility.\nThis is not the first time Trump has worked to delegitimize the courts. During the election, he accused U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel of bias against him because of his Mexican heritage. Curiel was born and raised in Indiana.\nIt's not just the courts in Trump's sights Nor is the judiciary the first American institution Trump attacked. He spent the entire election and first week of his presidency attacking mainstream media. The press is well conditioned to play the pariah, as virtually all reporters know they will be unloved. It goes with the territory. But Trump is arguing the press is “the opposition party” and a threat to the state. This weekend he further argued he is the arbiter of what is true, what is fact.\nWhile calling the New York Times “fake news” this weekend, he tweeted out, “ Any negative polls are fake news , just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election. Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting.”\nHe also tweeted, \"I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it. Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!\"\nIf rejecting polls or other news that is “negative” sounds familiar, Trump used that same standard to burrow beneath another important part of our democracy – the electoral system.\nDuring the general election, Trump said at one point he would only accept the results if he wins. Such talk might have led to large-scale rejection of our electoral system had Trump, in fact, lost.\nWe accept Trump’s legitimacy as president. He won the election and deserves the opportunity to stand up his government. But we expect him to do so in a responsible way that is true to the standards of this nation.\nSupporters have limits (and should say so) CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nThe list includes big names like Apple, Google and Facebook. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\nSome of Trump's behavior threatens our way of government, so much so that we wonder if he knows his own voters. He once said of his supporters, “I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters.\"\nIn short, he was saying his supporters have suspended their judgment. But is that true? We talk to lots of Trump voters everyday who are thoughtful and well spoken. Many come from the high strata of success and education in this country.\nAnd we suspect they have limits even Trump can exceed.\nAny American who manages medium to large enterprises could see that Trump’s travel and immigration order was executed with almost criminal recklessness.\nMembers of his own party noticed, wrote Peggy Noonan, a conservative Wall Street Journal columnist who has so far been guardedly optimistic about a Trump White House. “There was no Republican in Washington — not one, on the Hill or within the party structure — who did not privately call the order (on travel) a disaster.”\nEDITORIAL: Trump's first week didn't put America first\n“…The handling of the order,” wrote Noonan, “further legitimized the desire of many congressional Republicans to distance themselves from the president, something they feel they’ll eventually have to do anyway because they know how to evaluate political horse flesh, and when they look at him they see Chief Crazy Horse.”\nAfter some significant erosion in his poll numbers in the first two weeks of his administration, Donald Trump’s bedrock support stands today at about 40 percent. If he holds that he can govern. But he has to stay on the rails. He can’t continue to undermine American institutions.\nHis own voters would serve him well by calling him out when he violates first principles, such as browbeating and berating a federal judge who ruled against him.\nThere are words for such conduct. They are “anti-democratic” and “anti-American.”", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b06873beb62bb64f7167583513762b5047020cb/c=107-0-2345-1682&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2017/02/06/Phoenix/Phoenix/636220035671600896-robart-image.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/06/Bergen/NorthJersey/636219966649089548-Trump3.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/1493/29906170001_5310110848001_5310107745001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/news/politics/2017/02/03/federal-judge-halts-trump", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d44bf9ac740cfa2e4c015e985cf20e4ec8d6fdc9/r=540/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/1493/29906170001_5310110847001_5310107745001-vs.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/3035/29906170001_5312872581001_5312844603001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/1493/29906170001_5310110847001_5310107745001-vs.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33d97f8a03d5ea06baca0f7a30eca34c8bd87643/r=500x281/local/-/media/2017/02/06/Phoenix/Phoenix/636220035671600896-robart-image.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2jXLXce&text=Our%20View%3A%20How%20many%20chances%20does%20the%20leader%20of%20the%20free%20world%20get%3F&via=azcentral", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/201702/1493/29906170001_5310117472001_5310107745001.mp4", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/201702/3035/29906170001_5312874726001_5312844603001.mp4", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2264.0/images/sprites/icon_close.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d44bf9ac740cfa2e4c015e985cf20e4ec8d6fdc9/r=540/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/3035/29906170001_5312872764001_5312844603001-vs.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/1493/29906170001_5310110847001_5310107745001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/tech/news/2017/02/06/dozens-tech-companies-fighting-trump", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/06/Phoenix/Phoenix/636220035671600896-robart-image.jpg", "http://usat.ly/2l2pnEp", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/1493/29906170001_5310110848001_5310107745001-th.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/3035/29906170001_5312872581001_5312844603001-th.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2jXLXce&mini=true", "http://usat.ly/2jVAlXb", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/3035/29906170001_5312872764001_5312844603001-vs.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/3035/29906170001_5312872764001_5312844603001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f121bd945e79cfbe165c6d92b10523b588c4160/r=500x389/local/-/media/2017/02/06/Bergen/NorthJersey/636219966649089548-Trump3.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4e7a35da4b28f2c07dcbf3a8d5d632cfa9bf54d4/c=0-14-1024-784&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2017/02/06/Bergen/NorthJersey/636219966649089548-Trump3.JPG"], "published": "2017-02-07T21:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:47:37.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
