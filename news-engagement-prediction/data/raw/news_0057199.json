But OpenSignal's numbers document speeds as they are clocked in the real world.\nFor this report, the company analyzed more than 19 billion data points from more than a million devices in 87 countries.\nIn the aggregate, it found that mobile users in South Korea enjoy the fastest mobile speeds in the world, at 37.54 megabits per second. Norway, Singapore and Hungary all topped 30 megabits, a cut-off that OpenSignal calls \"a high bar to achieve, as it requires not only having powerful LTE networks but also extremely high access to those 4G connections.\"\nCanada fared comparatively well, too, with an aggregate score of 20.26 megabits per second. That's an improvement from last year, and places Canada in a group of just 13 countries above the 20-megabit threshold. All other countries in that group are either in Europe, Asia or Oceania.\nSee how all 87 countries ranked in speed here Canadian mobile users, on the whole, get mobile speeds that are generally much faster than those in the U.S., which clocked in at 12.48 megabits per second.\nAggregate Canadian speeds were more than twice as fast as those seen in South Africa, Mexico and Brazil, for example.\nOpenSignal's numbers aggregate totals found in various places across the country, but many companies claim mobile speeds exponentially higher than what OpenSignal found, depending on your location and level of service.\nBell Mobility, for example, advertises speeds for users in downtown Toronto of up to 335 megabits per second .\nRogers, meanwhile, says some users can expect maximum theoretical download speeds of up to 100 megabits per second  on the Rogers LTE network.\nAnd Telus says it offers up to 225 megabits per second on its top-of-the-line LTE plan.\nTelus speed claims not based on real-world experience \nOpenSignal also tracked the percentage of time that users were connected to Wi-Fi, which many mobile users use to supplement both downloading speeds and also keep costs low by not racking up large overages on their cellular plans.\n\"Many countries with fast overall connections still made good use of Wi-Fi,\" OpenSignal found, and Canada was no exception, with the company tabulating that Canadian mobile users are, on the whole, able to connect to a Wi-Fi network 60.65 per cent of the time.\nThe Netherlands led the way in that category, with users in that country spending almost 69 per cent of their time with access to a Wi-Fi network.\n\"The Netherlands has some of the fastest cellular connections in the world but that in no way steered users away from Wi-Fi,\" OpenSignal said.\nSee how all 87 countries ranked for Wi-Fi here Almost half the countries on the list saw Wi-Fi ratios above 50 per cent, meaning mobile devices are connected to Wi-Fi more than half the time. The exception was in many developing African and Asian countries, which is likely indicative of their less robust broadband infrastructure, the company said.\n\"In a large part of the world our users are spending as much time connected to Wi-Fi networks as they are to cellular networks,\" OpenSignal said. \"Rather than acting as a mere supplement to 4G networks, Wi-Fi remains as important a technology as any cellular system in mobile communications.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:31:49.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
