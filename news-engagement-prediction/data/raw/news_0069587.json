(Smiley N. Pool/The Dallas Morning News) By SportsDayDFW.com Contact SportsDayDFW.com on Twitter: @SportsDayDFW \nThe Dallas Cowboys will play the Arizona Cardinals in the Pro Football Hall of Fame game at Canton, Ohio. \nThe game will be Thursday for the first time -- August 3 at 7 p.m. Central. Owner Jerry Jones will be inducted into the Hall on Saturday, Aug. 5. \nThe game is a preseason game. The Cowboys will now play five exhibition games instead of the usual four. \nThe rest of the Cowboys' schedule will be announced in April, but we already know the regular-season opponents (and Dallas has a tough schedule). \nLast year's Hall of Fame game was cancelled because of field quality conditions at Tom Benson Stadium. \nThe last time Dallas played in the game was 2013 against the Miami Dolphins, before Larry Allen was inducted. \nCowboys in Hall of Fame Game (2-3) \n1968 - vs. Chicago Bears (L, 24-30) \n1979 - vs. Oakland Raiders (L, 13-20) \n1999 - vs. Cleveland Browns (L, 17-20 OT) \n2010 - vs. Cincinnati Bengals (W, 16-7) \n2013 - vs. Miami Dolphins (W, 24-20) BREAKING NEWS: The @dallascowboys will play the @AZCardinals in the Hall of Fame Game! #PFHOF17 pic.twitter.com/X5VpsLbkbf â€” Pro Football HOF (@ProFootballHOF) February 23, 2017 This Topic is Missing Your Voice.
