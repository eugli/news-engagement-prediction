(Matt Sayles/Invision/AP) \nAdele appeared flushed but resplendent in green backstage at the Grammys after becoming the first artist ever to sweep the categories of album, record and song of the year twice. \nAs with her final acceptance speech, the singer, who won five Grammys Sunday night, gushed over the importance of Beyonce’s “Lemonade,” saying that she had spoken to her childhood idol both before and after the show. \nShe also said that her mistake during her George Michael tribute, which caused her to drop multiple f-bombs and ask for the song to be started over, left her feeling “devastated” \n“My earliest memory of me being a fan was ‘Fastlove’,” she recalled. “When the video came out, I was blown away by how hot he was. I was young, I was about 10 and I heard the vulnerability in that song.” \nAfter Michael died, Adele told her partner Simon Konecki that she had to be the one to perform his Grammy tribute. At first his family didn’t want a tribute, she said, but they later came back to the Grammys specifying that they would allow a tribute only if Adele performed it. \n“I found him to be one of the truest icons, because famous people often create this massive bravado to protect themselves, but for him it wasn’t based on a look or an assumption,” she said. “And he was very British … the British press really gave him a hard time, but he still stayed loyal to the very end.” \nWriting “25” was a difficult experience for Adele, who felt in many ways as if she had disappeared after having her son. \n“I felt the pressure writing ’25,’ and in the process I couldn’t find my voice. I’m still not sure I did,” she confessed. “I was gone for so long. I had my baby and raised him through the toddler years, and then slowly edged my way back into work, but I thought that nobody would care.” \n“The Grammy means a lot to me and I’m very humbled by that accomplishment … but like I said in my speech my album of the year was ‘Lemonade,’ so a part of me died inside,” she said, adding that the prize was largely for her son who knows, “I’m a powerful force, he feels it at home and when he goes to work with me.” \nShe said that she wrote a lot less of “25” than she did of “21” because, “I had a bad drinking problem with ’21,’ so I couldn’t really find the inspiration this time around.” \nShe wrapped up her time with the press by circling back to Beyonce who she said became her idol when she was 11. She was practicing a song for an assembly and she suggested to her friends that they do a Spice Girls song, but then her friends played a track by Destiny’s Child. \n“I remember how I felt when I heard it, and I fell in love immediately with her and that was when I was 11, and I’m 28 now, and how I felt when I heard ‘No, No, No’ was exactly how I felt when I heard ‘Lemonade’ last year,” she said. “For her to be making such relevant music for that long of a period—I felt like it was her time to win—what does she have to do to win album of the year?” \nShe continued, “The Grammys are very traditional, but I thought this year would be the year that they would go with the tide. I’m very grateful to have won it, but I felt the need [to do what she did during her acceptance speech] because I love her and I felt she is more worthy.” Latest updates", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T13:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:53:28.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
