GETTY Low pressure systems drive Britain's wet, windy and stormy conditions GETTY There has been huge interest in the phenomenon also known as “explosive cyclogenisis” GETTY Severe wind and snow have been brought to Britain by the 'bomb' GETTY High winds cut into Northern Ireland as the 'bomb' hit Britain \n“Of course, it's important to realise that the definition of a ‘bomb’ is somewhat arbitrary and 'just a number'; a depression deepening only slightly less than 24hPa in 24 hours will still be a powerful depression more than capable of producing severe weather. \n“Another important point is that the track a ‘bomb’ takes relative to the British Isles, and at what stage of its development it does so, are key to its impact on UK weather – in general the closer the ‘bomb’ tracks to the British Isles the more severe the weather.” \nDr Steven Godby, an expert in natural hazards at Nottingham Trent University, said: “Infamous examples of ‘weather bombs’ include the storm that wreaked havoc during the August 1979 Fastnet yacht race, claiming the lives of 15 competitors, and the 1991 \"Perfect Storm\" off the north east coast of the United States, which was the inspiration for the novel and film that told the story of the sinking of the fishing vessel Andrea Gail.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:41:48.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
