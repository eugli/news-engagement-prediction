But this year there is a new intensity and a sense of frustration .\nRELATED : Arizona parents, teachers denounce divisive school bills \nThis might seem odd considering that Gov. Doug Ducey declared in his State of the State speech that education would be a priority. His budget includes increases that are within the limits of the currently available resources.\nBut for some, a teacher raise that amounts to 0.4 percent per year is woefully inadequate.\nVouchers weaken argument about resources The argument that this is the best Arizona can do right now is less convincing with a proposal back at the Legislature to expand state-funded vouchers for private schools.\nAn analysis by the Joint Legislative Budget Committee says allowing any child to use public funding to attend private schools represents a cost to the state that will rise over time.\nA similar proposal to remove the caps from the state’s voucher system was pulled last year because the optics were bad.\nEDITORIAL: Why expanding vouchers is so dangerous \nIt didn’t look right to be siphoning money from public schools at that the same time voters were being asked to pass Proposition 123, which was Ducey’s plan to settle a lawsuit over what the court said was illegal underfunding of schools.\nVoters approved Prop. 123, which pulls money from the state land trust to repay part of what our schools were owed under a previous voter mandate. The proposition will add $3.5 billion to school funding in the next decade.\nThat is not peanuts, but it doesn't make schools whole, either.\nWe were promised Prop. 123 just a first step Last year, Ducey said the proposition was just the beginning.\nThis year, increasing numbers of Arizonans are saying his next steps are too small.\nThis editorial page also supported Prop. 123 with the understanding that bold actions would follow. We supported the governor’s budget request this year for a modest increase in K-12 funding.\nWith Ducey and GOP lawmakers opposed to raising taxes, his proposal was the best the state could do with the revenues available.\nBut the state is flirting with a move to siphon money from K-12 schools with an expanded vouchers through the Empowerment Scholarship Account program that provides public funding for private schools.\nExpanding vouchers would divert millions CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nEverything you need to know about the Empowerment Scholarship Program in Arizona. Wochit \nDespite assertions from supporters that vouchers save money, an analysis of data from the Joint Legislative Budget Committee by The Republic found that expanding vouchers could divert $75 million a year from the state’s general fund by 2030.\nRELATED : School-voucher expansion could cost Arizona $24M a year or more \nAn analysis by the Arizona School Boards Association found vouchers would cost the state from $1,100 to $1,300 per student per year.\nIn a recent opinion piece in The Arizona Daily Star , Patrick Elliott of the Wisconsin-based Freedom from Religion Foundation wrote that Milwaukee’s voucher program , the longest running in the nation, amounts to publicly funding religious instruction , including science curriculum that opposes the “man-made idea of evolution.”\nExpanding vouchers in Arizona has the support of the Arizona Catholic Conference and the Center for Arizona Policy, which both have religious underpinnings. The latter conservative group long has had the ear of GOP lawmakers.\nPublic education supporters' voice counts Advocates for public education need to be heard, too.\nBut they feel Republican lawmakers on education committees stacked the deck against them during hearings on school voucher bills.\nParents say they waited five hours to testify against school vouchers in the House, and were then given less time to talk than the supporters.\nMembers of the public who take the time to become involved in their government should not be left feeling stung.\nArizona’s elected officials need to remember they work for the people, and those who are speaking out about public education deserve to be heard and taken seriously.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:57:58.041+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
