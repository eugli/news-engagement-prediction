The movie is reportedly based on the Emergency era, a 21-month period from 1975 to 1977, when Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency across the country.\nMeanwhile, former Times Now Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami announced his new venture 'Republic' that will be launched in the first quarter of 2017. Arnab's venture 'Republic' will reportedly be called 'Republic TV' after Rajya Sabha MP and senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy filed a complaint.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:05:42.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
