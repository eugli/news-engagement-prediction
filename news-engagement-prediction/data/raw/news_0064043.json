[E1N1FF00S] \nGuajardo said he expected North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations with both the United States and Canada to begin this summer and conclude by the end of this year. \nHowever, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said on Thursday he did not see any changes to NAFTA in the short-term \nBut hopes for a thawing in relations are low, after a series of botched meetings last month deepened tensions between the historic allies. \n“The relationship… is at such a historic low that it would be wishful thinking to assume that new concrete agenda items to advance [it] will come at this point,” Jason Marczak, director of the Atlantic Council’s Latin America Economic Growth Initiative said. \nPena Nieto abruptly canceled a planned January summit with Trump after the real estate mogul suggested the Mexican leader should not come if he refused to pay for a border wall. \nAnd Trump signed his first executive orders to punish sanctuary cities and build the wall, which could cost around $21.6 billion, the first time Videgaray traveled to Washington to negotiate with counterparts last month. \nTrump has also threatened to rip up the trade deal between the United States and Mexico if he cannot renegotiate it to favor American interests. \nTrump’s administration also plans to hire 15,000 more immigration and border agents, while subjecting immigrants who cannot show they have been in the country for more than two years to “expedited removal.” \n(Additional reporting by Gabriel Stargardter, Christine Murray, Adriana Barrera and David Alire Garcia; Editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Alistair Bell) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:48:33.205+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
