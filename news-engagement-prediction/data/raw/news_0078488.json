(Bergen County’s blue laws, in a twist of irony, keep the chapel closed on Sundays .) It is in a space tucked away from other stores, with little foot traffic. But the chapel is listed in the mall directory , and worshipers occasionally stumble in or hear about it through word of mouth. The chapel draws almost 1,000 people to Mass each week. Photo Susan Munroe has dedicated most of her waking hours to volunteering at the chapel. “It’s an oasis,” she said. “It’s a place to come and charge up your batteries in the middle of the day.” Credit Bryan Anselm for The New York Times The mall’s manager did not respond to a request for comment. St. Therese’s Chapel has been a place where a woman in her 80s, who has retired from driving the busy roadways to her home parish, can walk to morning Mass, and where another woman said she drew strength as her 3-year-old daughter was being treated for cancer. (The daughter is now 21 and healthy; her mother still comes.) Groups gather in the chapel to pray the rosary, while others dip in for confession. But many worshipers say they are not upset with the mall, and instead, expressed gratitude for the generosity they had been shown by the management over the years. They are choosing to meet this setback with optimism: The last time they had to move, they ended up in a better location, and now they are praying that this will be an instance in which history repeats itself. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Still, the looming closing has brought sadness and worry. Mary Rogers, 83, has been coming to Mass several times a week for decades, some days bringing all of her eight children before school. “We’re praying to St. Therese, the patron saint,” she said. “My days just don’t go as well if I don’t go to Mass.” Places of worship are not often found squeezed in with food courts and makeup counters, but such sanctuaries represented an effort to reach worshipers where they were. The Carmelites operate another chapel in a mall in Peabody, Mass., outside Boston. In Paramus, the windowless chapel has the low-slung tiled ceiling and fluorescent lights of an antiseptic office space. But a crucifix hangs at the front of the room, which is lined with prayer candles, statues and even children’s art. Stained-glass windows have been hung in light boxes on one wall. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Marty Rotella, a musician, said the modesty of the environs was not an issue. “It doesn’t matter if it’s in a small chapel, in a mall or on the side of a mountain,” he said. “What matters is the presence of his love. It doesn’t matter it’s in the mall.” On a recent Saturday morning, Mr. Rotella was among the three dozen people who came to the first Mass of the day. The priest, the Rev. Eugene Joseph Bettinger, did not have the help of altar servers or readers. The only choral music came at communion when the priest hit the play button on a small boombox. Photo The chapel, which opened at the mall in 1970, attracts about 1,000 people to Mass each week. Many worshipers are meeting the chapel’s closing with optimism, hoping that the change will lead to a better location. Credit Bryan Anselm for The New York Times Father Bettinger, a 70-year-old Carmelite priest and the chapel’s executive director for 15 years, reminded the congregation of the challenge they face. “It will be a Lent of the hunting,” he told them. “After Ash Wednesday, it will be quite the desert experience for us.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story After Mass, Father Bettinger, whose beard and ring of hair matched his white robes, took a seat in the gift shop. Ms. Munroe kept handing him items that people had purchased so he could bless them: the crucifixes a woman bought for her nephews, a figurine of the Virgin Mary carrying a baby Jesus, a stack of prayer cards. \nAdvertisement He said new potential locations had already been scouted, but finding a new home will not be easy. “You see the potential, the possibilities — if you can afford it,” Father Bettinger said of some of the places.
