The report lists the complainant as 'Brady, Tom' – a 39-year-old white male weighing 225 pounds with a height of 6 feet 4 inches. But when the Super Bowl hero returned to his locker (above), he was shocked to learn that his game-worn jersey was missing There was a possibility that the jersey was simply packed away on a team equipment 18-wheeler truck after their stunning win, but the truck arrived in Boston earlier this month and the highly sought-after jersey was not on it So far, the investigation has not yielded any major breakthroughs. There was a possibility that the jersey was simply packed away on a team equipment 18-wheeler truck after their stunning win, but the truck arrived in Boston earlier this month and the highly sought-after jersey was not on it. Since it was revealed the jersey went missing, recovering it has been a huge concern and top priority for Texas' top law enforcement agencies and even Governor Dan Patrick. Brady claimed that he remembers placing the special jersey inside his bag, but lost track of his personal items shortly after that. The Houston Police Department issued a preliminary report (above) saying that the jersey is worth $500,000 - which means that stealing it is a first degree felony punishable by a prison sentence ranging from five years to life 'I put (the jersey) in my bag and I went in (to the locker room) to take my eye black off and they had opened up to, I don't know, the media,' the 39-year-old quarterback said on WEEI last week. 'And I walked back to my bag and it was gone. Same thing happened two years ago (in the Super Bowl against Seattle). That sucks, but, oh well.' After the jersey went missing, Houston Police announced they were the lead agency investigating along with several other law enforcement agencies. A reward is being offered by Crime Stoppers in Houston. A spokesman told DailyMail.com offers up to $5,000 for information leading to an arrest in a felony case, but would not comment specifically on the Brady jersey search. During a television appearance last week, Brady's boss, Patriots owner Robert Kraft, says the jersey is akin to a pricey work of art. 'It's very sad to me that someone would do something like this, and it's like taking a great Chagall or Picasso or something,' Kraft said. 'You can never display it. And somehow, I feel there'll be some news that'll clear this up in the not-too-distant future. … I hope it'll be cleared up soon.'
