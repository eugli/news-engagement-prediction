I FERRY HER AROUND 14 HOURS A WEEK Jessica Morgan-Hoole, 10, lives in Prestbury, Cheshire, with her mother, Gaynor, 45, who runs a property company, and her father, Tim, 45, a company director. Mum Gaynor says: My job running a property company is done on the move — it has to be, so I can ferry Jessica around all her classes. Luckily, I can work remotely. I spend around 14 hours a week taking Jessica to and from her lessons. Why put us through this? I want this life for her. She has everything from scuba-diving tuition to Portuguese classes and loves every moment. Portuguese lessons came about because, until Jessica was five, we lived in our villa in Portugal. So she spoke English and Portuguese and I wanted her to continue. Jessica Morgan-Hoole, 10, lives in Prestbury, Cheshire, with her mother, Gaynor, 45, who runs a property company, and her father, Tim, 45, a company director. Jessica's mum says that she spend 14 hours a week ferrying her daughter to and from activities For us, it's important she's among the right people. So we send her to the King's School in Macclesfield. It costs £4,000 a term, but it's worth it. There are some early starts — we're up at 6.30am two mornings, for guitar and choir practice. Lunchtimes are filled with activities: from design and technology to acoustic guitar. Every evening there's more: karate, IT, cooking. It can be exhausting, but she's very committed. Weekends are also busy: she has private Portuguese lessons and, skiing lessons, scuba diving, tennis practice, as well as golf sessions. I played tennis professionally and believe tennis can open any door in life. I insist she takes Friday evenings off so we can relax as a family. Downtime is important. All this does come at a price: around £6,000 a year for the extra-curricular activities. But Jessica is very driven. JESSICA, 10: WORKS 60 HOURS A WEEK She says: I sleep like a dream but even if I'm a bit tired in the morning, there's no question of snoozing for a few minutes. I don't want to miss anything. The challenge is finding new things to learn.
