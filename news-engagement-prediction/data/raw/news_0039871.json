It really is a mean, green machine this year. \n“I’m definitely hungry to go out there and put wins on the board. I certainly didn’t meet my expectations last year and that’s something that needs to change in 2017. Mark Winterbottom and his 2017 Bottle-O Ford Falcon Supercar.

The changes they’ve all been working on at the workshop over the break look really positive so I’m looking forward to giving this new tyre a try and seeing how things go at the test day.
