Teachers and academics said that let religious ideology trump science on evolution, and might have left students believing God created life. \nBut the board opted to keep other lessons on the origin of life and scrutinizing fossil record gaps, which some conservatives say suggests the influence of a higher power. \nThe board votes again Friday and in April. It could further modify curriculums either time. \nThe standards govern what’s covered in Texas classrooms, on standardized tests and in textbooks. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
