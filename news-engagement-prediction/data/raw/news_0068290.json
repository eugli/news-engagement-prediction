(Facebook)\nStill, the animals and their handlers spend hours every week working on exercises to keep their skills sharp.\n\"We want to be a tool in the toolbox for the government, emergency officials and SARVAC to use if and when they need us,\" said Barnes, who has been vice-president of the group for the past three years.\n\"I feel that we could be such a strong addition to our emergency services within the province, as [civilian] search dogs are used all over the world successfully.\"\nMelanie Barnes with Ella during a training exercise in the Goulds.

She's trained to recognize non-specific human scent carried on the wind.\nAnd the team certainly gets creative when it comes to putting the dogs to the test. Their volunteer 'hiders' can spend hours tucked away waiting to be sniffed out.\nTraining director Gary Barnes marking a find by his dog Loki. You can see the 'hider' under Gary's elbow on the left.

(Facebook)\nThe not-for-profit group trains twice a week. They spend four to five hours every Sunday in a wilderness area, and put the dogs through their paces in an urban setting on Tuesday nights, usually in the dark.\n'Why aren't we doing this?' While they aren't called upon by the province to help in search and rescue work right now, training the dogs takes time, and the team wants to be ready.\n'It's really rewarding to be able to work with these animals and see what a canine is capable of.' - Melanie Barnes \"Our hopes are to be there and be ready if and when — hopefully when — the government comes around and says, 'Wow, OK, the majority of the other provinces are utilizing these dogs with success...so why aren't we doing this?,\" said Barnes.\nShe added, \"We're not just a team that's up having a laugh a few times a week, we're serious about this and we want to help.\"\nThe right stuff The organization holds a beginner course every spring as a fundraiser, teaching the basics of search and rescue to interested people and their pets.\nDogs with potential can continue on with the group, but not every canine is cut out for the work. Ideal candidates need to have drive, energy and the stature to get the job done.\n\"You want a big enough animal that can manoeuvre in our wilderness. Tiny, tiny dogs, a Pomeranian, probably not so much,\" said Barnes.\nLoki, a six-year-old Bernese Mountain Dog, gets a treat from his handler Gary Barnes after sniffing out the location of the 'hider' in the red hat. (Submitted)\nIt has taken two years of work to bring Ella up to certification level, and even though those skills aren't yet recognized by the province, Barnes has enjoyed every minute of it.\n\"I love what I do with my dog so much...it's really rewarding to be able to work with these animals and see what a canine is capable of,\" she said.\nNot needed: provincial government A spokesperson for Newfoundland and Labrador's Department of Justice said that while government appreciates the group's effort to get involved, there is no place for the group to help out right now.\n\"There is no current need for enhanced resources,\" Lesley Clarke said in a statement to CBC News, adding that the RCMP and RNC each have five dogs to assist with search and rescue missions.\n\"That complement is \"sufficient to meet search and rescue needs,\" Clarke said.\nClarke said that if the need arises, the group would be considered in the future.\nWith files from the St. John's Morning Show", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:59:03.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
