May his soul rest in peace.” \nMoosa died peacefully at his family home on Sunday morning after a short illness, a family spokesperson confirmed. \n“I feel that we have lost a part of us,” fellow human rights campaigner Mansoor Jaffer said of his comrade of more than 30 years. \n“We forged bonds through the anti-apartheid struggle in the trenches.” \nZuma said Moosa would be remembered for his immense contribution in promoting and protecting human rights in his various roles. \nMoosa hailed from District Six in Cape Town, which was flattened by the apartheid government. He went on to become a human rights lawyer, challenging apartheid violations such as detention without trial, and was a founding member of the National Association of Democratic Lawyers. \nHe retired as a judge of the Western Cape High Court in 2011 and in 2013 he was appointed head of a unit that would investigate complaints against members of the Directorate for Priority Crimes Investigations, better known as the Hawks.
