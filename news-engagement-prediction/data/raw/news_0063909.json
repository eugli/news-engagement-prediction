Here we suggest you five things that can make your life simpler and your room a lot more organised. more lifestyle Updated: Feb 22, 2017 10:57 IST ANI, New Delhi Studying in bed for long hours can damage your posture. Use a table to study for better concentration, say experts.(Shutterstock) \nWith exams just round the corner, it’s time students set their priorities right — a rigorous timetable, proper diet, sufficient sleep, no distractions and a decluttered room for improved concentration. \nSo, Pritika Chatterjee, the founder of TidyHomz, an online space catering to all home needs, lists five things that students must have in their rooms for better focus and academic performance. \nLaptop table \nMany students study in their bed. This affects their posture as they usually keep their books on their laps to study. An ergonomically designed laptop table provides students with the right height as it can be adjusted as per needs. These laptop tables can also be folded and put aside when not in use. \nLaundry bag \nNo one really has the time to do laundry when preparing for exams? Throw all your dirty clothes in our laundry bag and take care of it once exams are over. Instead to throwing your dirty clothes all over, use a laundry bag to keep all the unwashed stuff in one place. \n3-piece food box \nMake your meals in advance and store them in food storage boxes. These microwave/fridge and dishwasher safe boxes can come in handy in times like exams when you want to cook food once in a day and store it for later use. \nLanterns A post shared by Katie Kate Kate (@antiaphrodite) on Feb 21, 2017 at 6:29pm PST \nSince you’d be spending all your day in your room studying, it is important to have an environment that inspires. Sometimes, lights in the room play a very important role in making the ambiance reading-friendly and welcoming. Using hanging lanterns or fairy lights is a good option. \nMultipurpose rack \nTired of carrying books and papers from one room to the other? A multipurpose rack can come in handy here. Its design and wheels at the bottom can help carry things around. As per your need, it can be used for keeping books/clothes/shoes and pretty much everything. \nSo organise your room, concentrate and do well.
