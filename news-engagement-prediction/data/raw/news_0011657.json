Source: Cairns Snake Catcher Huge scrub python released after trying its luck 'at all you can eat duck buffet' \nMatt Hagan from Cairns Snake Catchers said the scrub python was curled right up at the entrance of the duck enclosure at a Queensland property, searching for a tasty meal. \n\"(It) was desperately trying to find the entrance to the all you can eat duck buffet,\" the Cairns Snake Catchers wrote on Facebook. \n\"Meticulous snake proofing of the duck enclosure was all that stopped this massive 5.2m scrub python from finding his seat at the table.\" \nThe \"gentle giant\" was spotted at a rural property surrounded by rainforest at Speewah, in far north Queensland. The scrub python was said to be desperately trying to find an entrance to the duck enclosure. Source: Cairns Snake Catcher \n\"A big snake like that is quite powerful so the structure has to be pretty sound,\" Mr Hagan told 7News Online. \n\"If they can get their head through they can push really hard and push their way in.\" The reptile measured 5.2metres and weighed about 22 kilograms. Source: Cairns Snake Catcher \nMr Hagan said the property has a lot of birds and ducks, and he has been there a couple of times before. \n\"It's a mecca for really big scrub python. Every snake I've caught there has been huge,\" said Mr Hagan. \nWhile the owners are said to be used to seeing reptiles, they didn't want this guest to have an extended stay. \n\"This one they weren't comfortable keeping around, which I can understand.\" The unwelcome gentle giant has been released into a national park. Source: Cairns Snake Catcher \nVideo of the reptile being released has been uploaded to the Cairns Snake Catcher Facebook page. \nThe massive animal was caught late last week and released into the Barron Gorge National Park. \nWith the recent wet weather in this part of the state, the snake catcher is warning people to be wary about scaly visitors who may find themselves searching for cover. \n\"When the monsoon really kicks in and we get days of rain we see an increase in activity in people's houses,\" said Mr Hagan. \nThe snake catcher is urging people to keep all screens on doors and windows shut - particularly at night.
