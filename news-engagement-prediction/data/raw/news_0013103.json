Protesters followed him, shouting: “Shame on you!”\nIn an equally conservative district in Florida, Representative Gus Bilirakis answered questions from town hall attendees worried about the loss of insurance and higher premiums if the ACA is repealed.\nThe events were captured on Facebook, the Saint Peters blog and other news organizations and echoed angry town halls that Democrats faced in 2009, when Obama pressed for passage of his sweeping law. \nRepublicans have repeatedly said the law is a costly disaster with rising costs. Democrats say the GOP effort will threaten healthcare availability and raise rates, angering 20 million people who gained insurance under the ACA and tens of millions of others who benefit from the statute’s coverage requirements.\n\nLast week, at a GOP retreat in Philadelphia, McClintock raised concerns about Republican plans.\n“We’d better be sure that we’re prepared to live with the market we’ve created,” McClintock was quoted as saying in secret recordings obtained by news outlets including the Guardian . \n“That’s going to be called ‘Trumpcare’. Republicans will own that lock, stock and barrel, and we’ll be judged in the election less than two years away.”\nOn Saturday, McClintock was constantly interrupted and booed as he defended his party’s agenda at a theater in downtown Roseville, the population center of his sprawling congressional district, the Sacramento Bee reported .\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump supporter Lance Snead, left, is confronted by an anti-Trump protester, Louise Isaacson, during a rally in Roseville on Saturday.

There have been elections where our side has lost … just a word of friendly advice: remember that there were many people in America who disagreed with and feared Barack Obama just as vigorously as you disagree with and fear Donald Trump.”\nA video posted on the newspaper’s website showed demonstrators chanting “Shame on you!” as they followed McClintock as he walked to a waiting car surrounded by police officers.\nTrump supporters also attended the town hall. One, David Ramsey, said he volunteered for McClintock’s 2008 campaign and voted for Trump in November.\n“President Trump is doing what he said he was going to do,” Ramsey said. “I like what he’s talking about – securing our borders and vetting immigrants. Hopefully, he’ll lower taxes, and reduce big government and regulation.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T18:41:30.239+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
