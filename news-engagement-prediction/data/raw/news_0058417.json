Construction will continue throughout the summer, while the relocation of 12,000 workers onto the campus will take over six months.\nThe name of the 175-acre campus is in reference to the building replacing \"miles of asphalt sprawl\" with a \"haven of green space,\" as explained in the company's statement. In addition, the building will run entirely on renewable energy.\nThe combination of \"advanced\" buildings with miles of greenery will provide a space for employees to be creative and to work closely together as a team, Apple chief design officer Jony Ive said in the statement. \"[Steve Jobs] invested so much of his energy creating and supporting vital, creative environments,\" Ive said. \"We have approached the design, engineering and making of our new campus with the same enthusiasm and design principles that characterize our products.\"\nIn light of Job's birthday being this Friday, when he would have turned 62, the company also announced that the new 1,000-seat auditorium on the campus will be named the Steve Jobs Theater. The building will feature a 20-foot-tall glass cylinder at its entrance and will sit on a hill overlooking meadows and the main building.\n\"Steve's vision for Apple stretched far beyond his time with us. He intended Apple Park to be the home of innovation for generations to come,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in the statement. \"The workspaces and parklands are designed to inspire our team as well as benefit the environment.\"\nThe headquarters will include a visitors center with an Apple Store and a cafe open to the public, Apple said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:19:32.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
