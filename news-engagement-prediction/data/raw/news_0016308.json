Reuters 9 Photographers hovered in the skies over Cupertino, California, to capture these incredible images \nFrom the arrangement of electrical wiring to the finish of a hidden pipe, no aspect of the 2.8 million-square-foot main building has been too small to attract scrutiny. \nBut constructing a building as flawless as a hand-held device is no easy feat, according interviews with nearly two dozen current and former workers on the project, most of whom would not be named because they signed non-disclosure agreements. \nSince Apple unveiled its plans in 2011, the move-in date has slowly receded: Jobs’ initial projection was 2015, but this spring now seems most likely, according to people involved in the project. A lengthy approval process with the city contributed to the delay. Reuters 9 The ‘Campus’ is estimated to have cost more than £4billion \nApple has not revealed the total price tag, but former project managers estimate it at about $5 billion – a figure CEO Tim Cook did not dispute in a 2015 TV interview. More than $1 billion was allocated for the interior of the main building alone, according to a former construction manager. \nFor all the time and money sunk into the project, some in the architecture community question whether Apple has focused on the right ends. \nThe campus is something of an exception to the trend of radically open offices aimed at fostering collaboration, said Louise Mozingo, a professor and chair of the Department of Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning at U.C. Berkeley. Reuters 9 The building dwarfs everything around it \nIts central office building a massive ring of glass frequently likened to a spaceship could be a challenge just to navigate, she noted. \n“It’s not about maximizing the productivity of the office space, it’s about creating a symbolic centre for this global company,” she said. \nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment for this story. Who was Steve Jobs? Your guide to the Apple founder who commissioned its 'spaceship' HQ \nJobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, to Abdulfattah Jandali, a Syrian student and later political scientist now known as John, and Joanne Carole Schieble. \nIt was the 1950s and the couple were young and unmarried so the baby boy was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. \nJobs grew up in the town of Mountain View, California, among the fruit orchards that would one day become the technology hub Silicon Valley. \nAs a teenager he phoned William Hewlett, president of computer firm Hewlett-Packard, to ask for parts for a school project. \nHe also landed a summer job with the firm where, as a 14-year-old in 1969, he befriended 19-year-old engineer Steve Wozniak. \nIn 1976, Jobs and Wozniak designed the Apple I. In contrast to the firm’s now obsessive design detail, the Apple I had no keyboard or display monitor and customers had to assemble it themselves. \nMore models followed before the Macintosh became a 1980s sales hit. \nBut Jobs was a hard taskmaster and clashed frequently with colleagues. He was ousted from Apple in 1986 following internal power struggles and a slump in sales. \nBut Jobs was a hard taskmaster and clashed frequently with colleagues. He was ousted from Apple in 1986 following internal power struggles and a slump in sales. \nHowever, by 1996 he was back at the then-struggling firm, which had come close to going under. In 2001, Jobs masterminded the launch of the iPod, which revolutionised portable music and kick-started Apple’s commercial comeback. \nThe firm has now sold more than 300million iPods. \nOn the release of the iPhone in 2007, Jobs insisted the handsets were “revolutionary and magical”. \nHis genius at branding and promotion has helped Apple sell more than 100million iPhones worldwide. \nby Oliver Harvey 9 The Apple Campus features the world’s larges piece of curved glass \nTech companies have long favored generic office parks, which allow them to lease and shed space through booms and busts. \nJobs unveiling of what’s formally known as Apple Campus 2, months before his death, marked a new chapter in Silicon Valley architecture. \nWhen completed, the campus will house up to 14,200 employees, according to the 2013 project description. \nThe main building which boasts the world’s largest piece of curved glass will be surrounded by a lush canopy of thousands of trees. \nLittle remains from the cement-laden campus Apple acquired from Hewlett-Packard, though the iPhone maker preserved a century-old barn that remained intact as the land passed from tech giant to tech giant. Reuters 9 Corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley are often built so that workers don’t have to leave very often, with gyms, restaurants and outdoor recreation areas \nBut what was most striking to those who worked on the project was Apple managers’ insistence on treating the construction of the vast complex the same way they approach the design of pocket-sized electronics. \nApple’s in-house construction team enforced many rules: No vents or pipes could be reflected in the glass. Guidelines for the special wood used frequently throughout the building ran to some 30 pages. \nTolerances, the distance materials may deviate from desired measurements, were a particular focus. On many projects, the standard is 1/8 of an inch at best; Apple often demanded far less, even for hidden surfaces. \nThe company’s keen design sense enhanced the project, but its expectations sometimes clashed with construction realities, a former architect said. Reuters 9 Thousands of Apple staff will work in the building when it opens this year \n“With phones, you can build to very, very minute tolerances,” he said. “You would never design to that level of tolerance on a building. Your doors would jam.” \nThe project, which generated about 13,000 full-time construction jobs, took a toll on contractors. \nThe original general contractors, Skanska USA and DPR Construction, left after work began, which construction experts called a rare development for a project of such scale. \nThe reasons for the departures are unclear, and neither Apple nor the firms would comment. \nApple’s novel approach to the building took many forms. Architect German de la Torre, who worked on the project, found many of the proportions – such as the curve of a rounded corner – came from Apple’s products. \nThe elevator buttons struck some workers as resembling the iPhone’s home button; one former manager even likened the toilet’s sleek design to the device. \nBut de la Torre ultimately saw that Apple executives were not trying to evoke the iPhone. Reuters 9 The HQ has been dubbed the Fruit Loop due to its distinctive shape \n“They have arrived at design principles somehow through many years of experimentation, and they are faithful to those principles,” de la Torre said. \nFanatical attention to detail is a key tenet. Early in construction, Apple managers told the construction team that the ceiling – composed of large panels of polished concrete – should be immaculate inside and out, just as the inside of the iPhones audio jack is a finished product, a former construction manager recalled. \nThus, each of the thousands of ceiling panels had to win approval from both Apple’s in-house team and the general contractor, once at the shop and then again at the construction site. \n“The things you cant see, they all mattered to Apple, the former construction manager said. Reuters 9 The building has been constructed with an obsessive eye for detail \nOne of the most vexing features was the doorways, which Apple wanted to be perfectly flat, with no threshold. The construction team pushed back, but Apple held firm. \nThe rationale? If engineers had to adjust their gait while entering the building, they risked distraction from their work, according to a former construction manager. \n“We spent months trying not to do that because that time, money and stuff that’s never been done before”, the former construction manager said. \nTime and time again, Apple managers spent months perfecting minute features, creating a domino effect that set back other parts of the project, former construction managers say. \nSignage required a delicate balancing act: Apple wanted all signs to reflect its sleek, minimalist aesthetic, but the fire department needed to ensure the building could be swiftly navigated in an emergency. Reuters 9 The design of the Campus has been likened to a space ship \nDirk Mattern, a retired deputy fire chief who is representing the Santa Clara County Fire Department on the project, estimated he attended 15 meetings that touched on the topic. \n“I’ve never spent so much time on signage,” he said. \nWhen Apple tapped general contractors Holder Construction and Rudolph & Sletten to finish the main building in 2015, one of the first orders of business was finalizing a door handle for conference rooms and offices. \nAfter months of back and forth, construction workers presented their work to a manager from Apples in-house team, who turned the sample over and over in his hands. Finally, he said he felt a faint bump.
