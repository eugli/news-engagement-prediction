JUST WATCHED Chicago Mayor urges Trump to help 'Dreamers' 01:57 Story highlights Santiago Tobar Potes: President Trump recently said he would announce a policy about DACA recipients Please, Mr. President, give us the opportunity that your family had to make this country our home as well, he writes Santiago Tobar Potes was brought to the United States by his parents from Colombia undocumented at age 4 and is now a student at Columbia University in New York. Follow him on Twitter: @stobarpotes . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN) I am one of an estimated 750,000 Dreamers , undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, now facing possible deportation by President Donald Trump. I worry that the President -- whose grandfather, mother and wife all immigrated to America -- will turn my dream into a nightmare and throw me out of the land where I grew up. A few weeks ago I felt like I was dreaming when I was at a White House event and met first lady Michelle Obama. I had just been appointed to the student advisory board for her Better Make Room initiative, which encourages young people to go to college. I am inspired by Better Make Room and want to help more young people improve their lives through higher education. But as I watched President Trump being inaugurated, I found it hard to believe he might make it impossible for me to go to college in this country. For the time being, I am here legally under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program created by President Obama through an executive order in 2012. But how long that will last is anyone's guess. Santiago Tobar Potes I came to America in 2002 as a 4-year-old, brought to Miami from my native Colombia by my parents. It should be obvious that at such a young age I did not ask to come here. Nor did I assist my parents in crossing the border without documentation. Nor did I assist my parents in overstaying our visas. Read More It should also be obvious that while President Trump described undocumented Mexican immigrants as rapists, drug dealers and other criminals when he announced his candidacy in 2015, I was none of these things when I was a 4-year-old. And I have not become one in the years since. My family fled Cali in Colombia -- home of the infamous drug cartel -- after rebel forces of the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) killed my grandparents. My parents felt that our lives would be in danger if we stayed. Today I live in New York as a freshman at Columbia University. My education is funded by scholarships from the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation , the Alexander Hamilton Scholars , Questbridge and Golden Doors Scholars . These organizations have judged me by my ability rather than my birthplace.
