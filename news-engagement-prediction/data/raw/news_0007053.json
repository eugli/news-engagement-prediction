Bush. Though he came across as mild-mannered and genial in his introduction to the nation, he’s been widely described as a natural heir to the fiercely conservative Scalia. His nomination re-solidifies the right-wing majority on the Court, which has been left with only eight members since Scalia’s death. \nHe made his name with conservative decisions in cases involving craft store chain Hobby Lobby and the Little Sisters of the Poor Home For The Aged. In both instances, he sided with the plaintiffs, who were challenging a mandate to provide contraceptives under the Affordable Care Act. As Fusion’s Rafi Schwartz wrote: \nIn other words, should Judge Gorsuch be confirmed, he could possibly side in favor of those for whom “religious liberty” is used to justify everything from denying certain types of health care to women, to discriminating against members of the LGBTQ community. \nAlong with his rulings on religious liberty, Gorsuch is known, according to BuzzFeed , for having \nwritten a book and done significant other writing on the topic of assisted suicide. In addition, he has laid out important views on law in more arcane, but nonetheless key, areas involving administrative law — a crucial issue as Trump’s administration begins taking significant executive actions — and the so-called “ Dormant Commerce Clause ,” which limits state actions hurting out-of-state commerce. \nThe announcement comes after congressional Republicans spent 9 months stonewalling President Obama’s nominee to fill the vacancy, Merrick Garland . While Trump was still a candidate, he cheered the party’s efforts to blackball an Obama nominee, taunting, “It’s called delay, delay, delay.” Story Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:07:08.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
