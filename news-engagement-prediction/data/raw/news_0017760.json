I'm going to give a free commercial, here, go buy it today everybody, you can find it online,\" she said.\nExperts quickly pointed out Conway's words may violate executive branch ethics rules.\nLarry Noble, general counsel at Washington, D.C. watchdog the Campaign Legal Center, noted on Twitter that Conway might have violated a ban on government employees from endorsing products or services.\nAppears Kellayanne Conway may have just violated ban on Federal employee using public office for endorsement of product. 5 CFR 2635.702 https://t.co/mIvngSHCnk\nâ€” Larry Noble (@LarryNoble_DC) February 9, 2017 The rule in question bars government employees from using public office for his or her own private gain, the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise or for the gain of friends, relatives or other affiliates.\nDon Fox, former general counsel and former acting director of the Office of Government Ethics, told The Washington Post Conway's commercial \"would seem to be a clear violation of rules prohibiting misuse of public office for anyone's private gain,\" calling her words \"jaw-dropping.\"\nFormer Obama ethics czar Norm Eisen echoed the point in an interview with MSNBC on Thursday. \"By doing this ad, I have never seen anything like it, it's a violation of the rules, pure and simple,\" he said.\nEisen, who has emerged as one of Trump's fiercest ethics critics, said the responsibility to oversee the matter will initially reside with Trump White House counsel Don McGahn and the OGE. \"It's a serious matter,\" he said.\nTrump aid Kellyanne Conway\nThe White House on Wednesday defended Trump over a mid-morning tweet accusing retailer Nordstrom of \"unfairly\" treating his daughter by dropping her clothing and accessories line. The company insists the decision is not politically motivated but business-driven.\nPress Secretary Sean Spicer said the president has \"every right to stand up for his family,\" even as ethics experts said Trump's tweet -- which came from his personal @RealDonaldTrump account but was retweeted by the official @POTUS account -- might be problematic as well.\nConway on Thursday called the grassroots group #GrabYourWallet, which encourages consumers to boycott companies that carry Trump family products, a \"huge failure.\" But that might not be the case.\nTJX Companies ( TJX ) , which owns T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, has instructed employees not to display Ivanka Trump merchandise separately, though it remains on the sales floor. Neiman Marcus has said it will drop Ivanka Trump's line.\nNordstrom thus far appears not to have been hurt by its decision -- in fact, quite the opposite.\nShares of the company were up 3.3% midday Thursday and climbed more than 4% on Wednesday.\nTJX Companies is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.
