Or when both of you reach for the same door handle – only to realise that this is their car, not yours? We hear you. \nThat’s why, we’re making it a lot easier for you to recognise your ride when it’s approaching. \nNow, once you’ve requested a ride, the colour of your car icon in the app will match your driver’s car. You’ll be able to see this from within the app itself – on the map. \nColoured car icons can help riders recognise their Uber rides even before they’re picked up. We already share the driver’s name, photo, vehicle make and model, a license plate in the app, and are excited to add another tool to help riders identify their Uber. \nWe’re doing this to improve the pickup experience based on feedback from riders and driver-partners. When riders and drivers can easily find each other, we’re able to trim down wait times, which is a win for everyone! This is just the kind of smart innovation that keeps Singapore moving forward. \nTry requesting a ride today – which car colour will you be matched with?
