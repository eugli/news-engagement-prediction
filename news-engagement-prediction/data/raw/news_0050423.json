Article continues below \nThis week could see him come back to haunt one of his former Premier League rivals as Monaco prepare to take on Manchester City in the first leg of the last-16 Champions League tie. \nAnd it would appear as though City boss Pep Guardiola is taking the threat the Colombian international poses seriously, and explained why he's managed to claw his way back from the edge.

They are so, so strong in that area,\" he added. \n\"As a spectator, it is so nice to see them, I'm really impressed by how good they are. The full-backs play like wingers; the wingers play like attacking midfielder; the two strikers are fighters. \n\"In the box, Falcao and Germain are killers.
