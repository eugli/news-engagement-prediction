There’s little doubt that modern cancer “treatments” actually kill more people than cancer itself. (Yet their death certificates always state they were killed by cancer, not by chemotherapy or radiation.) Learn more about the toxic cancer industry at CancerScams.com . \nAccording to Radar Online, Napolitano was diagnosed with cancer last year and has been undergoing “treatment” with toxic chemotherapy drugs for the last five months. Her cancer treatment history demonstrates yet again how the cancer industry is a total failure that never really prevents or treats cancer. “Napolitano had her right breast removed in 2000 after being diagnosed with cancer. Four years later, she had surgery to remove her right ovary and an ovarian cyst,” reports Radar Online. \nMuch of the cancer industry is a criminal racket . Just last year, a prominent oncologist in the Detroit area was sent to prison for falsely diagnosing African-American patients with cancer so he could profit from the chemotherapy “treatment” they didn’t need. Thousands of patients were ultimately subjected to toxic chemicals that damaged them for life.

Sadly, Napolitano looks determined to become yet another victim of the very same exploitative system of government lies she once proliferated in exchange for a paycheck. Remember: While she was telling America that patriots were terrorists, the cancer industry was telling America that there’s “no such thing as an anti-cancer food, nutrient or supplement.” \nIt turns out that believing establishment lies about cancer can literally cost you your life . Why are we not surprised she’s now in charge of California’s university education system that’s also steeped in a total disconnect from reality? \nIt turns out you really do reap what you sow.
