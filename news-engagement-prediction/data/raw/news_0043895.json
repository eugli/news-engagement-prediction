They get them when they’re young and they might corner a big one too,” Dr Raven told The Courier-Mail . \n“They (geckos) prey on everything and anything that is sedentary on the wall, so spiders that hunt on walls would be getting hit. \n“Not many things at all (kill a gecko), the redbacks are amongst them and a big huntsman in a good position could kill and eat geckos, and snakes could, but snakes are getting killed by the (cane) toad.” media_camera If you want to get rid of spiders make sure yon don’t chase these little guys out. Picture: Supplied \nDr Raven said while the span of a huntsman in northern Queensland could easily cover the average dinner plate, you’re unlikely to see an abundance of the spiders in southeast Queensland of late because of the recent hot spell. \n“None of the spiders are doing really extremely well in the southeast,” he said. “There’s not enough moisture around to keep the insect population up to provide food for these guys. media_camera The brown huntsman.

Picture: Queensland Museum \n“The north is doing really well but not so in the areas which haven’t had really good rains.” \nAfter the huntsman, the giant golden orb spider is the next biggest-spanned arachnid. \nThey are usually found anywhere north of Noosa and on occasion in the “forestry” parts of Brisbane. \nHowever, you’re most likely to come across a garden orb spider in southeast Queensland but don’t panic if you walk into their web. \n“A spider will normally run away from you when it’s disturbed, up the web and into the trees,” Dr Raven said. \n“Unless you actually grab the spider and the spider tangles with your face (it will bite you). For people of normal health it’s a minor reaction but people who are asthmatic or diabetic will show more reactivity on the face,” he said. media_camera The tarantula.

They don’t like the southeast corner,” he said. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:26:55.936+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
