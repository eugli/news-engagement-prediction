He then added a follow-up: \"#Merylsayshi.\" (FWIW, the first tweet has more than 100,000 retweets in less than 5 minutes.) This was far from the night's first Trump diss—Kimmel dedicated a large chunk of his opening monologue to mocking the president for calling Meryl Streep \"overrated.\" White House press secretary Sean Spicer did say Trump had better things to do this evening than hate-tweet the Oscars—now, we wait and see whether he can resist this open Twitter provocation.
