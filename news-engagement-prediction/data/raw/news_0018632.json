The film is said to be based on the life of Chandu Chekavar, an infamous warrior in the 13th century North Malabar, Kerala. Veeram, which has been shot in three different languages - Hindi, English and Malayalam – has been directed by National Award-winner Jayaraj. \nVeeram, touted to be the most expensive Malayalam film carrying a budget of around Rs 20 crores, is an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s play Macbeth.

He asked me to put on muscles to look apart. That was something that I did. But by putting on those muscles, what was really difficult was to maintain that image because we were shooting for most of the time in a day,” Kunal said in September 2016. \nThe film, which premiered at the BRICS Film Festival on September 2, 2016 in New Delhi, had many foreign technicians working on it. These include Oscar winning make-up artist Trefor Proud and action choreographer Allan Poppleton from New Zealand. \n(With IANS inputs) ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:54:58.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
