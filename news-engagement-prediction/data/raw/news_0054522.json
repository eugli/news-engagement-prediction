As the country’s boss, Salmond had to oversee a commercial invasion by Trump, who built a links golf course on Scotland’s stony northeastern coast and ended up in a legal and public-relations war with the SNP government over wind farm plans. \nIt was, for those who noticed, an instructive preview of the chaos Trump is now creating on a bigger stage. Salmond qualifies as a fully credentialed expert on Trump’s strategic approach — the bluster and hyperbole, the detachment from facts, the wild veering between execration and friendliness. \nIt is typical of Salmond that he chose to assess Trump coldly, even half-admiringly, amidst others who were simply catcalling and denouncing. And he perhaps had a point. Salmond spoke during a Commons committee debate on Trump’s projected state visit to Britain, which was arranged and announced by Prime Minister Theresa May mere days after his inauguration. Only two U.S. presidents, Bush II and Obama, have been formally received by the Queen on British soil. May, eager to strengthen the “special relationship” as Britain wrestles free from the European Union, was mighty quick to play a card she cannot easily take back. Related Petition to rescind bid for state visit surpasses million signatures: Don’t let Trump ‘bask in Queen ’s reflective glory’ \nSome 1.8 million Brits supposedly signed a petition asking May to rescind the offer of a state visit. When it comes to Labour and other left-wing MPs, Trumpophobia is having its typical perverse effects. These privilege-haters have suddenly developed a touching concern for the Queen’s conscience and prestige, as if having to be in the same room as a crude, erratic U.S. president were unthinkably nauseating for a person who has picked up trainloads of corgi poo. Paul Flynn, Labour’s ancient Welsh radical, even accused the Conservative government of “pimping out” her Majesty. \nThis attracted the obvious response, which is that Flynn chose a very impolite way to characterize an accepted part of the Queen’s job description. She has welcomed dozens of dodgy heads of state in her 65 years on the throne — killers, brutes, thieves, fascists. She posed for photos with the Emperor Hirohito in his dotage and with the Ceaucescus — whose personal loathsomeness was so great it arguably led to the collapse of Communism in Europe — in their heyday. At least one visitor, the Indonesian strongman Suharto, is sometimes said to have perpetrated genocide. He visited the U.K. in 1979, a decade after the Stalinist terror-purge with which he consolidated power and only four years after the cruel invasion of East Timor. \nThe list of state visitors to the U.K. under Elizabeth II actually makes for a fascinating cross-section of 20th-century history. The Daily Mail did a listicle (of course they did) identifying the most “unsavoury” characters to hobnob with the Queen: they included a young Bashar al-Assad (2002), then still early his career of gassing and burning Syrian civilians, as well as Vladimir Putin (2003), Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe (1994) and Zaire’s Mobutu Sese Seko (1973). In the Mail’s article the latter pair stand in for a long series of African dictators of varying awfulness: when you put names like Nyerere, arap Moi, Kaunda, and Banda in one long row, it almost seems to invite a sabermetric-style quantitative analysis of authoritarianism, as if you were choosing a Hall of Fame. \nWithin her own British realm, the Queen has had to suffer the appointment of Sinn Féin ministers to Northern Ireland — persons who would have welcomed, and might once have planned, her assassination. Any social interaction with a mere foreigner is unlikely to unsettle or embarrass her to that degree. Some liberals actually hoped to derail the proposed Trump visit by pointing out that the president once attended a Sinn Féin fundraising party in New York. This will not make the Queen like Trump more, but, being the Queen, she will do as her ministers instruct. \nAnd, yes, sometimes this is a matter of sordid national interest: call it “pimping” if you want to be a jerk about it. The emirs of Gulf states are almost always welcome at Buckingham Palace: being able to accommodate monarch-to-monarch chats is explicitly considered to be one of the great practical advantages of Britain having a royal family. In the post-colonial era, the Queen’s African visitors were chosen partly for their Cold War orientation. If you invited a passel of Soviet “advisors” into your country you could expect not to be invited to tea. \nHer majesty is said to have got on well (in 1973) with Gen. Yakubu Gowon, who had been the architect of Nigeria’s suppression of the breakaway republic of Biafra. The British government had armed and lent moral support to Nigerian forces in the Biafran War (1967-70), even recruiting the BBC to the cause; this was done to prevent the oil-rich Niger Delta from being balkanized, and led to starvation and atrocities that constitute one of the last ugly blots in the copybook of Britain’s empire. Gen. Gowon, overthrown by the inevitable colonel in 1975, is actually living in the English countryside today. Britain may be perfidious, but debts are debts. \nNational Post ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:04:29.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
