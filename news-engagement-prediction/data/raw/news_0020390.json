(TOI photo) VARANASI: Bhartiya Janata Party 's alliance partner and union minister Anupriya patel led Apna Dal (Sonelal) has jolted it by fielding candidates from Rohania, Marihan and Chunar assembly seats, where BJP had already fielded its candidates. AD(S) national spokesman Brijendra Pratap Singh released a list of four candidates on Wednesday evening. The party announced Neelratan Patel as its candidate from Sevapuri assembly constituency, Uday Singh Patel from Rohania seat in Varanasi, Anil Singh Patel from Chunar and Shiv Kumar Singh alias Pintu Patel from Marihan assembly seat in Mirzapur. The BJP had already announced Surendra Narain Audhey as its candidate from Rohania, Anurag Singh from Chunar and Rama Shankar Patel from Marihan. Talking to TOI over phone, Singh alleged that after allotting Soraon (SC) assembly seat to AD(S) the BJP state chief Keshav Prasad Maurya fielded his close one Surendra Chaudhary. He said that his party had already decided to field Jamuna Prasad Saroj from Soraon (SC) seat. He alleged that since Maurya is not ready to withdraw the candidature of Chaudhary from Soraon (SC) seat his party is feeling it free to field the candidates from the seats of its choice. Regarding future of BJP-AD(S) alliance following this move of his party Singh said, \"We are in alliance. Maurya should make his view clear on this alliance.\" According to Singh, talks between BJP president Amit Shah and Anupriya Patel had resulted in allotment of 12 seats to AD(S). Out of these 12 seats, he said party had already announced 11 candidates while candidate from Pindra assembly seat in Varanasi will also be announced very soon. He said that party is also finalizing the names of candidates for Duddhi (ST) and Obra (ST) assembly seats in Sonebhadra. He said that talks between Shah and Anupriya Patel are still continuing and AD(S) can get 18 seats in alliance. But, for the decision of fielding candidates from the assembly seats where BJP had already announced its candidates, he said that AD(S) will think on this issue only after Maurya would clear his stand on Soraon (SC) seat. Anupriya's mother Krishna Patel led Apna Dal is already contesting separately from many seats. Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.
