Ad Feedback \nDavison had stolen a car from an unmanned Thrifty rental agency near Southern Cross Station minutes before the crash. \nHe had been separated from his friends earlier that night after he was repeatedly refused entry to a nightclub. \nHe matched a set of keys in the office with the recently returned car and drove away, crashing through a boom gate on the way out. \nAfter he killed Nayler, he ran past her body and later dumped his clothes. \nPolice directing traffic near the crime scene later arrested him for being drunk and wearing just his underwear. \nNayler's parents and a number of relatives were in court for Davison's pre-sentence hearing. \nMany of the 30 victim impact statements from family and friends were read and a video and photo tribute to Nayler was played to the court. \nVivien Nayler said her daughter was her best friend and \"my world\", and had exchanged phone calls or text messages every day before she died. \nBefore she died, Tanami had text-messaged her to let her know she had arrived in Melbourne safely and loved her. \nNayler described her only child as intelligent, artistic and witty. \nHer daughter, she said, had \"lived life to the full\" and was beautiful \"inside and out\". \nNayler said she now lived in a \"constant state of misery\", with hopes of planning Tanami's possible future wedding and travelling with her now gone. \nWhile the community lived within a 24-hour news cycle and could forget her, she and her family and friends would mourn her for the rest of their lives. \nThe hearing, before Judge Christopher Ryan, continues. - Sydney Morning Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:05:53.566+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
