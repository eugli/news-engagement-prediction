IndiaToday.in | Edited by: Mohak Gupta A + A - Photo for representation: Reuters \nAbout 10,000 members of the Sikh community in Pakistan's Kyber Pakhtunkhwa province are having a tough time. Good education is missing and poor health facilities are provided, a Sikh leader said in remarks published on Tuesday. \nEarlier, the region used to brim with gurdwaras, but that's a story before the 1947 partition. Sikhs in Peshawar now use only two shrines, the Pakistan Today reported. \n\"Plazas have been constructed in place of some gurdwaras. The ones not sold have been taken over by land grabbing mafia,\" alleged Pakistan Sikh leader Radesh Singh Tony. \n\"The community does not have a cremation ground,\" he added. When a Sikh dies, he is taken to another district to be cremated. \nMembers of the Sikh community have also pulled their children out of schools due to safety concerns. \n\"We are renting property to create makeshift schools. It is difficult to bear the expenses. We request the government to provide us a building and funds for education,\" said school headmaster Baba Jugerpaal Singh. \nDespite the miserable conditions, the community hopes its issues will be resolved by the government.
