There are different levels of attunements depending on the class. \nAttunements help clear energetic pathways in the body, allowing Reiki energies to flow through the students body more easily. Not All Reiki Attunements are Equal \nAlthough some people have no discomfort or will notice only subtle changes, you may experience significant adjustments that can be temporarily unsettling until a new balance takes hold. An attunement clears blockages and offers balance. Depending on individual's body's state of being, experiences will vary. \nA period of purification before the attunement is suggested to aid this process. Please review this list of suggested preparations prior to scheduling your Reiki class. A Reiki attunement is not something you should take lightly, it is best to understand what one entails before you but yourself into the hands of a teacher. Your body will also thank you for taking cautionary steps prior to exposing it to the attunement process. Take special care in selecting your Reiki instructor. Schedule your class date at least one week in advance. Eliminate (or reduce) intake of meat, fowl, or fish from your diet 3 days prior to your class date. Consider doing a water or juice fast for 1 to 3 days prior to the attunement. Consume no alcohol for at least 3 days prior to the attunement. If you are on any type of medication continue to take it as prescribed prior to and on the day of attunement . Smokers should take care to smoke as little as possible for the day prior to the class date and on the day of the attunement. Avoid outside stimulation (tv, radio, computers, newspapers). Find moments (hours) of solitude. Meditation and spending time with nature (walks, sitting beside streams, etc.) Be gentle with yourself. Don't tackle any tasks that will deplete your energies. Drink plenty of water. Cleanse your aura prior to class. Get a good night's rest the evening before your class. In the morning if you are not fasting, eat a light healthy breakfast . \nTips: Daily prayers / connection with your inner guidance is recommended during this period. Be prepared for a 21 day cleansing period following the attunement process. If you are in a doctor's care you may wish to have him/her re-evaluate dosages of medicines being used after the 21 day purging/balancing period. If you are traveling to a distant town for your attunement consider that you may not feel up to driving home. Have an alternate plan to stay overnight at a motel.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:37.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
