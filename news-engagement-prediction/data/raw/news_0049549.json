Brain overgrowth was tied to the emergence of autistic social deficits in the second year. \nBy inputting these data, including MRI calculations of brain volume, surface area, and cortical thickness at 6 and 12 months of age, into a computer program, the researchers sought to classify babies most likely to meet ASD criteria at 24 months of age. \nThey found that, among infants with an older ASD sibling, the brain differences at 6 and 12 months of age successfully identified 80 per cent of those infants who would be clinically diagnosed with autism at 24 months of age. \nThe predictive power of the findings may lead to a diagnostic tool for ASD that could be used in the first year of life, before behavioural symptoms have emerged. \n\"We don't have such a tool yet,\" Estes was quoted as saying in a news release from UW. \"But if we did, parents of high-risk infants wouldn't need to wait for a diagnosis of ASD at 2, 3 or even 4 years and researchers could start developing interventions to prevent these children from falling behind in social and communication skills ... By the time ASD is diagnosed at 2 to 4 years, often children have already fallen behind their peers in terms of social skills, communication and language.\" \n(With IANS inputs) First Published: Sunday, February 19, 2017 - 08:57 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T10:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:38:22.895+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
