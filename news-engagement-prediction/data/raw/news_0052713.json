Trump says antisemitism is 'horrible' and has to stop (credit: REUTERS) The center’s executive-director Steven Goldstein said on Tuesday, “The President’s sudden acknowledgement is a Band-Aid on the cancer of antisemitism that has infected his own administration. His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting antisemitism, yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record. “Make no mistake: The antisemitism coming out of this administration is the worst we have ever seen from any administration. The White House repeatedly refused to mention Jews in its Holocaust remembrance , and had the audacity to take offense when the world pointed out the ramifications of Holocaust denial. And it was only yesterday, President’s Day, that Jewish Community Centers across the nation received bomb threats , and the president said absolutely nothing. When President Trump responds to antisemitism proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that’s when we’ll be able to say this president has turned a corner. This is not that moment.”In Washington, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer also scolded the center.“I think he [Trump] has been very forceful with his denunciation of people who seek to attack people because of their religion, because of their gender, because of the color of their skin. It is something that he is going to continue to fight and make clear that it has no place in this administration.”“It is ironic that no matter how many times he talks about this, it is never good enough. Today was an unbelievably forceful comment by the president as far as his denunciation of the actions that are currently targeted against Jewish community centers, but I think he has been very clear previous to this, that he wants to be someone who brings this country together and not divide people. “I wish that they had praised the president for his leadership in this area. Hopefully as time goes by, they recognize his commitment to civil rights, voting rights, and equality for all Americans,” Spicer said.In Israel, Dagan noted that the Anne Frank Center’s comments came as Israel is under attack from all directions, simply because it is a Jewish state.“Jews are killed here because of their religion,” he said.“The UN Security Council's absurd condemnation of Israel, the only democratic state in the Middle East, was also clearly motivated by antisemitism,” Dagan said.He called on it to also condemn the Palestinian desecration of Jewish graves on the Mount of Olives or its vandalism against Joseph’s Tomb in Nablus, otherwise known as the biblical city of Shehem.On Wednesday, US Vice President Mike Pence scored points with the Anne Frank Center when he visited a Jewish cemetery in the St. Louis suburb University City, where earlier in the week vandals had damaged over 150 tombstones.The Anne Frank Center thanked Pence for his visit.\"We call them as we see them,\" Goldstein said.”Today, Vice President Pence proved to be the ultimate mensch by visiting, and even cleaning, the desecrated Jewish graves in St. Louis. Make no mistake: We have been critical of President Trump for his gross insensitivity to antisemitism, including through his omission of Jews in Holocaust remembrance. But through the vice president's visit to St. Louis today, this administration finally showed America the kind of response our nation was waiting for all along - a response filled with proactive heart.\" Relevant to your professional network?
