Tuesday’s order will give the schools a free hand to admit toddlers using their own criteria. \n“State cannot impose a restriction on choice of parents to choose a school for their wards just because it is beneficial for the child,” justice Manmohan remarked.

In case seats remained vacant, those living within a 3-kilometre radius could get a chance. Which meant these schools could no longer deny admission to anyone from the neighbourhood. \nEarlier, the high court stayed city government’s controversial nursery admission notification that made it mandatory for private unaided minority schools to admit students, in the unreserved category, on the basis of neighbourhood criteria. \nThe order gave relief to around 15 minority schools in the capital that were set up on public land.
