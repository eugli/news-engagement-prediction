On the day the election results were announced, several celebrities tweeted in anger .

Robert De Niro speaks at a protest against U.S. President Donald Trump outside Trump International Hotel in New York City. (REUTERS) \nEveryone from Jennifer Lawrence , JK Rowling , Eminem , Angelina Jolie , and her ex-husband Brad Pitt have voiced disapproval of Donald Trump’s methods. Shia LaBeouf even got himself arrested for allegedly assaulting a Trump supporter during one of his live performance art pieces in which he spent the first few days of Trump’s presidency swaying, dancing and repeating the phrase “He will not divide us” in front of a live camera. \nYou can read (and listen to) some of them here: \nMore recently, the artists have made good use of the awards season to publicly express their opinions.

Everything is not ‘alright, alright, alright’ and Matthew McConaughey has painted a very large bullseye on his back. \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T17:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:35:36.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
