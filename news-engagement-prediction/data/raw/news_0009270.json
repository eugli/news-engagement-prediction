By hacking a Muse headband, which is a brain activity detector, Netflix engineers developed a unique way for any wearer of the headband to scroll through Netflix’s directory, select a title and play it -- by merely thinking about it. The Muse-Netflix headband cleverly titled Mindflix was showcased at Netflix’s recent ‘Hack Day’ event, where Netflix employees are encouraged to present the next big idea for the company to chase. The Mindflix headband isn’t flawless, but for a hacked device its limited success was promising enough to demonstrate the possibilities of controlling Netflix simply with the user’s mind power -- come to think of it, the Mindflix headband is the ultimate lazy binge-watching Netflix accompaniment. The Mindflix headband works by reading brain activity and using that data to feed it into a predetermined list of functions applicable for Netflix. As we can see in the video above, Mindflix wearers can not only move their heads to navigate screens and menus, but they can also start a show by simply thinking of \"Play\". Woah! While there’s no word if this Mindflix headband is the basis for a serious product in the future, it’s still a neat idea for Netflix to explore, because it blends in well with its mantra of ‘chilling’. \nThe Muse Headband reads electrical brain activity through electroencephalography waves We have just two issues with the idea. No one in the history of headbands -- be it Muse, VR goggles, Google Glass, etc -- has ever looked cool wearing one. \nAlso, what happens when a Mindflix user’s thoughts go astray? What if they look at a steamy Netflix show poster and start to think of porn? What happens then? Does the system malfunction and shut down follow the embarrassment? How do you reign in the wearer’s thought? Too many questions, very few answers...
