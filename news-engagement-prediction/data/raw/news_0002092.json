During an interview on BBC One, the interviewer, Andrew Marr, compared the story of McConaughey’s latest film Gold, which places a two-bit prospector at odds with Wall Street, to the current political divisiveness in America. Marr asked the actor if Hollywood should ease up on Trump. “Well, they don’t have a choice now,” McConaughey said. “He’s our president. And it’s very dynamic and as divisive of an inauguration and time as we’ve had. At the same time, it’s time for us to embrace and shake hands with this fact and be constructive with him over the next four years.”\nAs People points out, it’s not certain whether McConaughey did this interview, which aired on Sunday in the U.K., before or after the ban on refugees and travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations went into effect. McConaughey’s wife Camila Alves is an immigrant from Brazil who moved here when she was 15.\nTags: donald trump matthew mcconaughey muslim ban unpopular opinions Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Matthew McConaughey Says ‘It’s Time For Us To Embrace’ Donald Trump The 100 Recap: The End Of The World (Again) Melissa McCarthy Saves the Environment While Selling Kia Cars in Super Bowl Ad Most Viewed Stories The Serial Creators’ Next Podcast Series Sounds Like a Juicy, Bingeable Delight What’s New on Netflix: February 2017 There Was One Explicit Sex Scene in Girls That Even HBO Wouldn’t Allow Beyoncé Is Pregnant With Twins Jon Stewart Reveals Donald Trump’s Next Executive Orders to Stephen Colbert What to Stream Now See what's new and notable on Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and HBO The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Recap: The Snoring Twenties It Was Really Cold on The Bachelor Last Night Staring at Trump’s Body, What Do You See?
