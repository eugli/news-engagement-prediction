If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nThe 89 th Academy Awards hosted by Jimmy Kimmel will go down as a historic night for the annual ceremony – but perhaps for all the wrong reasons. \nThanks to an alleged envelope mix-up backstage, actors and Oscar presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced the wrong winner for the Best Picture category. Story continues below \nAfter reading the list of nominees, Beatty cracked open the envelope and paused. While the audience thought he was being comedic and building anticipation, that proved not to be the case. \nThe envelope allegedly read “ Emma Stone : La La Land ,” which confused Beatty enough to pass the envelope over to Dunaway, who then announced La La Land as the big winner. \nBut as the film’s producer Fred Berger was reading his thank-you speech, everyone – including Berger – knew something was up when a man with a headset came on stage with another red envelope in hand. That’s when Berger dropped the bomb. \n“There’s been a mistake,” he says. “ Moonlight , you guys won best picture. This is not a joke.” \nHowever, confusion set in once Stone revealed to reporters backstage that she had already been given her Best Actress card when she accepted her award. \n“I was also holding my ‘Best Actress in a leading role’ card that entire time,” she says. “So whatever story – I don’t mean to start stuff – but whatever story that was, I had that card.” \nIt was the moment that stole the spotlight, and cast a rather large shadow over the evening’s ceremony, even inspiring the trending hashtag on Twitter #OscarsGate .

That was for Best Music Score. Davis Jr. announced the winner as John Addison for T om Jones, when it was in fact Andrew Previn for Irma La Douce. \nBut last night’s fumble was only the cherry on top of a night filled with controversies and hiccups. \nHere are five other controversial moments of the night that got people talking. \nWATCH BELOW: ‘Moonlight’ cast, celebs react to Best Picture mixup at the Oscars 1. ‘Hidden Fences’ \nJess Cagle, the editor-in-chief of People, was on the red carpet talking about last year’s movies when he slipped up and said “hidden fences.” \n“You just happen to have these extraordinary movies like ‘Hidden Fences’ and Moonlight ,” Cagle said. He quickly realized his mistake, apologized and corrected himself. \nMany people on social media are still recovering from when Michael Keaton and Jenna Bush Hager made the same mistake during NBC’s Golden Globes red carpet pre-show. \nWhile speaking with Pharrell, Keaton mentioned his nomination for Hidden Figures , but awkwardly referred to the movie as “Hidden Fences” having clearly mixed it up with two-time Oscar winner Denzel Washington’s hit drama Fences . \nFences and Hidden Figures were both Best Picture nominees and both feature African-Americans in lead roles, and that’s about as far as they go in similarity. \nSome people even brought back the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag from last year’s awards. The hashtag was created to bring attention to all of the Oscars’ acting nominees being white, and saying the award have come to embody a diversity crisis in the entertainment industry. Every time someone says \"Hidden Fences\" pic.twitter.com/unWxwoES4M \n— Matthew A. Cherry (@MatthewACherry) February 27, 2017 How many time are white people going to say \"Hidden Fences\" tonight??? #OscarsSoWhite \n— Hippie Vandal (@2shedsjacquelin) February 27, 2017 10 minutes into the Oscars and a white dude already said \"Hidden Fences.\" \n— JASON O. (@jasonosia) February 27, 2017 We couldn't make it through the A-block of ABC's #Oscars coverage before someone said \"Hidden Fences.\" Cool. #OscarsSoWhite \n— Stephanie Levy (@stephanie_levy) February 27, 2017 \nWATCH BELOW: Barry Jenkins says Warren Beatty searched him out to show him Best Picture card \nREAD MORE: Oscars 2017: The best and worst of the red carpet 2. In Memoriam \nThe Oscar’s In Memoriam segment, which pays tribute to film industry figures who died over the past year, featured a wrong photo, according to Variety . \nThe photo was supposed to feature the late Australian costume designer Janet Patterson. The woman pictured was Jan Champman, an Australian producer who is very much alive. This came up in the In Memoriam section at #Oscars2017 . But isn't this (living) Australian film producer Jan Chapman? pic.twitter.com/YKIMGBUv5E \n— David Berthold (@DavidBerthold) February 27, 2017 \nPatterson, who died in October 2015, worked with Chapman on the 1993 film The Piano. \n“I was devastated by the use of my image in place of my great friend and longtime collaborator Janet Patterson,” Chapman told Variety in an email. “I had urged her agency to check any photograph which might be used and understand that they were told that the Academy had it covered. Janet was a great beauty and four-time Oscar nominee and it is very disappointing that the error was not picked up.” \n“I am alive and well and an active producer,” Chapman added. \nPeople on social media did not let this mistake go unnoticed. IF ANYONE FROM THE IN MEMORIUM IS STILL ALIVE PLEASE LET US KNOW \n— billy eichner (@billyeichner) February 27, 2017 Wrong envelope,\"In Memoriam\" includes live person -\"people who can't run an award show think they can tell POTUS how to run a country.\" \n— Cindy Johnson (@DJohn36755) February 27, 2017 Wow the #Oscars seem to have had more than 1 hiccup last night. Named the wrong best pic winner but also had a living person in memorium \n— Olivia Fahy (@Toxicolly) February 27, 2017 Wait, they really had someone in the In Memoriam who is still alive!? \n— Jake Neary (@jtneary21) February 27, 2017 3. The Lion King \nKimmel approached Sunny Pawar, who stars in the hit movie Lion , and after some back-and-forth banter about candy and the show, the host asked the eight-year-old boy if he had ever seen The Lion King . \nThen Kimmel asked if they could recreate the moment from the movie when Rafiki lifts Simba up into the air while standing on Pride Rock. \nPawar got out of his chair and let Kimmel lift him up in front of the entire audience. \nIt was meant to be a cute joke, but Twitter points out that there are some racial undertones that shouldn’t be ignored. \n— Daniel Zavarella (@Daz655321) February 27, 2017 Don't lift Brown kids up and play the lion king song 2k17 \n— alexis nedd (@alexisthenedd) February 27, 2017 I was actually liking #oscars2017 and then @jimmykimmel held up Sunny Pawar like The Lion King and the feeling of racist ick returned. #smh \n— Ms. Shah (@bluekrsna) February 27, 2017 Ooooh, Jimmy Kimmel, this is straight racist. #lionking #Oscars \n— Tanya O'Debra (@tanyaodebra) February 27, 2017 \nWATCH BELOW: ‘La La Land’ producer calls handing Best Picture award to ‘Moonlight’ a ‘real honour’ \nREAD MORE: Oscars 2017 winners list: ‘Moonlight’ wins Best Picture after bizarre gaffe, ‘La La Land’ takes home 6 4. Mel Gibson \nAnother thing some of the audience at home was not happy about was Mel Gibson’s presence at the ceremony and the amount of attention and praise he was receiving by his Academy peers. \nGibson’s movie Hackshaw Ridge (which he directed) was up for several awards including Best Picture, Actor in a Leading Role, Sound Editing, Sound Mixing and Directing. It won one award in the Film Editing category. \nThis, along with Kimmel’s throw to the actor and director several times throughout the night, did not sit well with people who remembered Gibson’s past racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic and misogynistic rhetoric. Hollywood, tell me how you're so progressive yet can still celebrate racists and assaulters like #MELGIBSON and #CaseyAffleck #Oscars \n— Christine Shev (@dorisbac2) February 27, 2017 I still think the most embarrassing thing to happen at the Oscars is that they let Mel Gibson in. \n— Buddy Nielsen (@buddythechud) February 27, 2017 Bigot/domestic batterer/blood-lusting misogynist and anti-Semite Mel Gibson up for multiple awards? Meh. But #envelopegate ohmygosh! \n— KennyHerzog (@KennyHerzog) February 27, 2017 \nIn 2006, Gibson was accused of being a wife-beater, misogynist and anti-Semite and was thought to have been battling alcoholism. \nOne instance in particular in July of that year, Gibson was pulled over by a Jewish police officer in California where he reportedly said, “F**king Jews… the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Are you a Jew?” 5. Casey Affleck’s Oscar Win \nMany people who tuned into the Oscars were not happy with Casey Affleck’s Best Actor Oscar win. \nTheir issue wasn’t with the actor’s performance, it was the fact that he was nominated at all. \nIn 2010, two women who worked on the set of Affleck’s experimental film titled, I’m Still Here , filed separate sexual harassment suits against him . \nActivists, critics and actors like Constance Wu have argued that Affleck’s nomination and behaviour continue sexism in Hollywood. Last year Brie Larson stood and hugged every sexual assault survivor who was on stage with Gaga and now she has to hug Casey Affleck. 👎🏼👎🏼 \n— stefanie o (@captainstefanie) February 27, 2017 Casey Affleck is avoiding eye contact with every woman in the room. #Oscars ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T20:14:38.967+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
