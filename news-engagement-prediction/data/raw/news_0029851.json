Some people want to ban it. 15/02/2017 11:08 | Updated 13 minutes ago Oscar Williams Tech reporter \nAll of a sudden, a flailing, purple bird is everywhere on Facebook. It’s popping up in the comments on statuses, photos and news articles, and seems destined for global domination. But where’s it from and what does it mean? Syd Weiler Facebook \nSyd Weiler , a Florida-based illustrator, launched the set of Trash Dove Facebook stickers earlier this month without much fanfare. But then, as is the way with the internet, something rather strange happened. \nOn 7 Feb, a Thai page published a video of the the nodding bird in a dance-off with a cat. At the time of publication, the video’s been viewed 4 million times. \nThe video prompted a flurry of media attention in Thailand, with news channels racing to cover its viral fame. \nWeiler thanked Thailand for making the purple bird a bid meme with a drawing of Trash Dove holding the Thai flag with its foot . When commenters pointed out that the foot hold was offensive, Weiler posted a thank you video with a tweaked image. \n“Hello Thailand, thank you all so so much for your support. I’m really glad that you like the stickers,” Weiler said. Syd Weiler \nSo what does it mean? \nWell, no one’s really sure. The BBC’s Rozina Sini suggested “perhaps its ambiguity is one of the reasons it is so popular”. \nThe Verge’s Kaitlyn Tiffany said it went viral because “birds are funny, and flailing is a common response to the trips and trials of every life on the web”. \nWeiler herself wrote on her Facebook page when she first revealed the design: “In case you didn’t know, I made some fantastically dumb iOS stickers, you can spam your friends and family with them!” \nGiven the bird’s viral success, a backlash was pretty inevitable. An Australian user of change.org has already started a petition to ban Trash Dove . But we don’t think it’ll be going away any time soon.
