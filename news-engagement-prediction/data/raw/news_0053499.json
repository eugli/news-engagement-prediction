And sometime next week Krisp Bird & Batter will add to that love affair when it debuts its crunchy bird brand in a new Galleria-neighborhood store. \nBut it's no ordinary chicken breasts that chef Ben McPherson is using for his fast-casual restaurant. Krisp is using only chicken that is pasture raised, antibiotic- and hormone-free, and raised on a non-GMO vegetarian diet. \"These chickens have remarkable flavor and texture,\" said McPherson, formerly executive chef of Prohibition Supperclub & Bar. \"During our extensive research and development process, this was decidedly the chicken that tasted like chicken. For us, it was clearly the 'wagyu' of chicken.\" \nThe chicken â€“ both grilled and hand-battered and fried --- will show up in chicken sandwiches constructed with house-made buns or between two Belgian waffles. In addition to chicken sandwiches, Krisp will serve salads made from locally-sourced vegetables, waffle cut fries, ice cream, milk shakes, waffle ice cream sandwiches, fresh fruit and Boomtown coffee. \nMcPherson said he wants Krisp to be the city's premier chicken sandwich concept. Even before its first store at 5922 Richmond opens, he's already mapped out a second location in the Heights. That store, at 2400 N. Shepherd, is set to open in June.
