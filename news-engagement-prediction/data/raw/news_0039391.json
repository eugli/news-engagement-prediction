Stella Ogden had a taco smash at her first birthday party. The photos have since gone viral. Wright told Babble that despite the popularity of the cake-smash trend, she wanted to make things more personal. “I was doing a lot of cake-smashes and it was getting redundant,” Wright said. “I wanted to get outside the box a bit, so I started asking parents if their babies had a favorite table food and if they’d want to do a smash with that instead.” So far, she has done everything from doughnuts to popsicles and even an entire barbecue meal. But one day, Wright said, an idea for tacos popped into her head and “I just had to find someone who wanted to do it.” Luckily, she met her match with the Ogdens. Lyndseys Photo Co. Stella Ogden had a taco smash at her first birthday party. The photos have since gone viral. “It just worked out perfectly that a longtime client-turned friend was having her daughter’s first birthday fiesta-themed,” she told Babble. And on top of that, Stella’s family chose the theme because of her love of Mexican food. “One of Stella’s first foods was rice and beans,” her mom said. “We have eaten out at our local authentic Mexican restaurant ever[y] Wednesday since she was born.” As you might have guessed by her adorable expressions, Stella loved every minute of the taco-smash. (Though she “mostly ate the sides ... [and] gnawed on the shells,” Wright said.) But she’s not the only one who loved it. Stella’s adorable photo shoot has gone viral in the past week on Facebook with more than 42,000 “likes.” 0 Shares ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T20:05:34.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
