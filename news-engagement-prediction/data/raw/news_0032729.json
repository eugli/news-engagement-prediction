Photo: Justin Mitchell has invented a piano that can fit inside a pocket. (ABC Radio Melbourne: Fiona Pepper) \nHe was awarded first prize in the BHP Billiton Science and Engineering Awards for student engineering and will now represent Australia at the world's biggest science and invention fair in the United States later this year. \nJustin's pocket-sized piano features 27 instrument settings with a one-octave scale that can be modulated up or down in pitch. \n\"I wanted to be able to play my music wherever I went and so I wouldn't be limited to having to lug around a big instrument or having to only play piano when I'm at home,\" he said. \nSynthetic took three weeks to build and the keyboard is made with electronically conductive paint which means it responds to touch. \nJustin also learned coding in order to create the instrument which he hoped was more portable than a traditional keyboard. Creative pocket entertainment \nAnd while the current model is a prototype, he will continue to develop the design. \n\"The future model would be printed into the hoodie pocket, making it truly wearable.\" \nJustin said he believed his invention had greater applications for professional musicians given its compact nature. \n\"They could plug it into editing software to do composition if they wanted to,\" he said. \nThe year nine student said if the invention gained traction, he'd look to mass produce it in the hope it could influence the way people used technology. \n\"I think it would really change the future in a way, in that it would stop people always pulling out their phones ... it gives them a creative thing to do. \n\"And I'd like to see it in the pockets of everyone.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T08:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:06:44.847+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
