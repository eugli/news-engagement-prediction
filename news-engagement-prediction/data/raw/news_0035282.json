Abbott reacted strongly earlier this week to the NFL's threats to remove future Super bowls' from Texas, ordering the league to concentrate on 'running a football league' and let us run the state. He told Fox News Channel last night that if the NFL does that, he'll support a bill that would require football players to stand and put their hands on their hearts during the playing of the National Anthem, a reference of the NFL supporting 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick kneeing during the Anthem, something that was very unpopular in Texas. \nA spokesman later said Abbott was 'joking.' \nLt. Gov Dan Patrick, who is the biggest backer of the bathroom bill, told a webcast earlier this week that threats of major events skipping the state if the bill is passed are overblown, pointing to the fact that the City of Houston nearly a year ago overwhelmingly approved a measure that essentially did the same thing in Houston that the bill now being debated in the Legislature would do statewide. \n\"Houston had the Super Bowl,\" Patrick said. \"I don't know of one business that has not come to Houston since we stood up and said 'we don't want men in ladies rooms and we don't want boys and girls showering together in school.\" \nPatrick also challenged the NFL to open the rest rooms in their own offices to anybody who wants to use any restroom, and said the league, which has ownership stakes in all stadiums, to immediately open the restrooms in those stadiums to all people. \n\"They won't do it,\" he said. \nIMAGE GETTY ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:14:01.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
