Loob Holdings chief executive officer, Bryan Loo, said with the exercise costing less than RM10mil, all its 161 outlets would be officially transformed to Tealive from tomorrow.“We also plan to increase the number of our outlets from 165 to 250 in Malaysia by 2018 as well as our customer base from 2.5 million a month to five million,” he told reporters after the soft launch of Tealive here today. On the global front, he said, Loob would tap the Vietnamese market in the third quarter of this year and other Asian countries in a couple of years. Loo said Tealive planned to expand its operations into more petrol stations nationwide, as well as light rail transit and mass rapid transit stations. He said the company was unfazed by the dispute between La Jaffa International Co Ltd and Loob and was confident of winning back its customers. The agreement between La Jaffa and Loob, which was to last until 2041, was terminated because of the Taiwanese firm’s disagreement on the business direction of Chatime in Malaysia. - Bernama", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T08:13:31.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
