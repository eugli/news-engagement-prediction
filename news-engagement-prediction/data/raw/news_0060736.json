Earlier this month, the president took to twitter to complain that Nordstrom had treated his daughter Ivanka “so unfairly” for dropping her fashion line from its stores, a move the retailer ascribed to weak sales for her merchandise. In response to a question on conference call Thursday to discuss Nordstrom’s quarterly results, Co-President Peter Nordstrom called the impact on sales “negligible,” adding that it was “not really discernible one way or the other.” After Trump’s tweet, Nordstrom’s stock surged to many people’s surprise. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person — always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 Nordstrom has been under pressure from the #GrabYourWallet campaign to drop Ivanka Trump merchandise over her father’s policies, lest it face a boycott. The retailer found itself in the unenviable position of being caught in a tug of war between supporters and critics of the president and his daughter.

And while its discount “Rack” business continues to flourish, particularly online, its main department stores saw comparable sales fall 6.8%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T00:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:21:16.878+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
