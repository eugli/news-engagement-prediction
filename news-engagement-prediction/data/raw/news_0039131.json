However, over the years her choice of subjects – albeit varied – have been largely catering to the class audiences. The last out and out massy film that she did was Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania , which was way back in 2014. Now three years later when she is bringing her first release of 2017, it is an out and out massy film again – Badrinath Ki Dulhania . The fact still remains that whatever that she did in the interim period has appealed more to the elitist. \nHumpty Sharma Ki Dulhania [2014] A full-on massy setup where her producer Karan Johar got her everything, right from a shining co-star Varun Dhawan to chartbuster tracks ( ‘Saturday Saturday’ , ‘Samjhaawan’ ) to aggressive pre-release campaign to a good release, Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania worked well with the audiences at A, B as well as C centres, and that too across mass and class centers. The film came soon after 2 States and emerged a hit. \nShaandaar [2015] Shaandaar was again a Karan Johar production and her co-star was charming too in the form of Shahid Kapoor . Alia did well with what she was asked to do. The treatment for the film though was quite unconventional and resultantly audience connect was limited. That said, ‘Gulabo’ turned out to be chartbuster and is played till date, latest example being Jolly LLB 2 in which Saurabh Shukla performs on it too. \nKapoor & Sons [2016] It was actually brave on Alia to pick this part where drama hinged entirely on Kapoor family, enacted primarily by Rishi Kapoor , Sidharth Malhotra and Fawad Khan . Yet another Karan Johar production, this was an out and out multiplex film which worked well with the class audience. Alia had a relatively lesser duration in the film but as a performer, she was appreciated all over again. Of course, ‘Chull’ worked big time! \nUdta Punjab [2016] This is one film where she got into the Highway zone all over again. A serious intense affair where Alia got into the Smita Patil zone and was willing to play this battered character who hailed from Bihar and was trapped in Punjab, it stays on to be the most non-glamorous part played by a leading lady in 2016, and that too at this stage of career. After this award winning performance, the masses waited for her though. \nDear Zindagi [2016] Back with a film from the house of Dharma Productions, Alia got into a serious avtar for Dear Zindagi , yet another out and out multiplex film. The trend continued, which means her performance was appreciated, she was at ease in front of the camera, and yet again the audience came in unison to acknowledge her as one of the most talented kids around. As for the song and dance routine, there as a promise for future. \nBadrinath Ki Dulhania [2017] Well, future is here as four years after Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania , Alia is back in almost the same set up, what with Badrinath Ki Dulhania taking the franchise forward. Her hero [Varun Dhawan], producer [Karan Johar], director [ Shashank Khaitan ] are all the same and two chartbusters [ ‘Tamma Tamma’ , ‘Badri Ki Dulhania’ ] are already on her platter. Bring on the masses, is what she could be screaming aloud now! \nCall it the ‘dulhania’ factor but it is apparent that it takes this franchise to bring an out and out massy actress out of Alia Bhatt! Will she wait for the third in this franchise to have fun all over again? Or would there be interim films too that would reach out to the class as well as mass alike? Well, one waits to see that happen. Meanwhile, it is time to watch her groove to ‘Tamma Tamma’ which is yet another chartbuster up her sleeve after ‘Saturday Saturday’ , ‘Gulabo’ and ‘Chull’ !
