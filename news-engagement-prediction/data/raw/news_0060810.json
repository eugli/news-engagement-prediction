We’ve seen Emma Stone , Jennifer Lawrence and Kylie Jenner rock this style ― just to name a few. \nWell, now Disney star and singer Dove Cameron is sporting the chic ‘do, too. She gave fans a sneak peek of her fresh new look in her most recent Instagram post, which she shot at an event in West Hollywood hosted by Vanity Fair and L’Oreal Paris. 💇🏼💇🏼 A post shared by ♡DOVE♡ (@dovecameron) on Feb 21, 2017 at 11:06pm PST \nWe’d say that’s a dramatic change, wouldn’t you?
