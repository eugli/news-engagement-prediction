The Kings recently completed a trade that sent the three-time NBA All-Star to the New Orleans Pelicans. \nFor many fans, this seemed like a long time coming. Cousins was hardly shy about his frustrations with the Kings' franchise, as management seemed incapable of surrounding him with quality talent. That attitude, combined with Cousins' frequent on-court outbursts (he's accumulated more technical fouls since 2012 than any other player), gave him a bad boy persona. \nBut there's a softer side to Boogie few fans know about. Cousins built a real connection with the Sacramento community thanks to his consistent charitable outreach. \nSince 2012, Cousins has regularly held free basketball camps in the area. In 2013, he donated $1 million to Sacramento families in need of assistance . In 2015, when a Sacramento area high school football player tragically died before a playoff game, Cousins covered his funeral costs . Cousins has done so much for the Sacramento community that there's an entire Reddit thread dedicated to documenting his charitable efforts. \nAt a \"going away party\" of sorts for Cousins last night in Sacramento, the big man gave a tearful goodbye to the city he grew so close with: My friend got transferred to another city because of his job. He had some things to say. Rough to watch. pic.twitter.com/iBRyMf1UP7 \n— Carmichael Dave (@CarmichaelDave) February 21, 2017 Much respect @boogiecousins .
