The police are still lookin for the coward ass nigga that just killed my niece at Walgreens in Tallahassee. If you got info pls help us out! \n— T-Pain (@TPAIN) August 30, 2016 \nCrimestoppers immediately offered a $15,000 reward for said “coward ass nigga’s” whereabouts, but it appears the hunt is now over. \nThe Tallahassee Police Department have long suspected 25-year-old Tavon Jackson to be behind Glover’s murder, as they were previously romantically involved with one another and also shared a 2-year-old daughter, the Tallahassee Democrat reports . The Democrat also reports that Glover and Jackson met while she attended Tallahassee Community College and he was a student at Florida A&M University. \nThe police, along with the U.S. Marshals, had reportedly been searching for him since August 30 but earlier this week, Jackson’s body was discovered in the woods near the murder scene and authorities are ruling it a suicide. \nPolice were actually patrolling the area for an unrelated case when his body turned up. \nAs of press time, T-Pain has yet to tweet about the recent developments in his niece’s case. \nWatch WCTV’s full news report on the latest scenario involving T-Pain’s late niece down below.
