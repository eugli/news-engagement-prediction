By Associated Press Feb 15, 2017 The phenomenon known as \"firefall\" draws scores of photographers to a spot near Horsetail Fall, which flows down the granite face of the park's famed rock formation, El Capitan. Every February a rare phenomenon makes Horsetail Fall @Yosemitenps glow like fire.

Horsetail Fall only flows in the winter or spring, when there is enough rain and snow. The sun lights up the fall for only about two minutes at dusk for a few days in February.   Some photographers have had success this year as pictures of the glowing falls are showing up on social media.
