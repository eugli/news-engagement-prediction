Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA student thought her severe headache was caused by exam stress – but a tampon had actually given her a life-threatening infection. \nPhoebee Bambury, 19, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, spent almost two weeks in hospital after contracting toxic shock syndrome last month. \nShe had just finished her exams for her degree in pharmacy, at Keele University, and was in the library preparing for the new term, when she started to feel unwell. \nShe explained: “I was feeling really awful. I went downstairs at the library and started to vomit so I went home to my student house. \n“I thought it was just because it was exam season and I'd been really stressed. I was a bit run down and it was that time of year where everyone gets sick.” Read More Furious families try to stop paedophile from moving back into home just yards away from two schools Phoebee can be seen in hospital where she spent 12 days being treated (Photo: PA Real Life) \nTrying to shake off her illness, she went home to relax before getting ready to celebrate her granddad George Ellis, 78, stepdad, Mark Chadwick, 49, and boyfriend Scott Lawton, 24, joint birthdays with her family at a restaurant in Stoke-on-Trent. \nBut as the party came to an end, she started burning up and her concerned mum, office manager Jane Chadwick, 49, told her to spend the night at her boyfriend’s house in Packmoor, Staffordshire, in case she got worse. \nDuring the night, she woke up and knew something was seriously wrong. \nShe said: “I was shivering really uncontrollably. All of my muscles were aching and I just really didn't feel well at all.” \nBut Phoebee was able to connect the dots and realised her symptoms sounded familiar. \n“It was ticking over in my head and I thought I knew what it sounded like,” she said. “I went and got a box of tampons and read out all the symptoms of toxic shock syndrome. Everything matched. \n“My boyfriend said it was probably just a bug or a virus, but I really didn't want to risk it. My friend's mum died from toxic shock and so did my dad's girlfriend's niece. \n\"I didn't know them personally, but I had been told stories about it and I knew how bad it can get.” The 19-year-old put her sickness down to exam stress (Photo: PA Real Life) \nShe immediately phoned 111 to ask for advice and they told her to go straight to hospital. \nKnowing that getting medical help quickly if it was TSS was important, she phoned her grandparents George and Mavis Ellis who took her to the Royal Stoke University Hospital. \nAfter speaking to a triage nurse, she was immediately admitted and hooked up to a drip. \n“I was still shaking and felt really cold but my temperature was 39.7 C. I was in agony - I had a really bad headache and I had really bad stomach pains. It was frightening because I felt so awful,” she said. \nFor weeks, Phoebee had been suffering heavy menstrual bleeding but, as concerned doctors investigated the cause of her symptoms, scans ruled out any gynaecological problems. \nDiagnosed with TSS – a rare infection which is caused by Staphylococcus or Streptococcus bacteria getting into the body’s deep tissue and releasing toxins that attack internal organs - Phoebee was given a cocktail of antibiotics and painkillers. \nHer body continued to react to the infection, causing days of vomiting, fevers and her body to swell so much, she put on 5kg because of the fluid.

I never leave them in for more than eight hours and I use ones that are right for my flow, but I was really unlucky. \n“I have had my boyfriend driving around town looking for the right size before - I know all the things to do but it happened any way. \n“It could have been so much worse though. People lose limbs or even die. At least I connected the dots and recognised the symptoms, because a lot of people just think it's a really bad cold,” she explained. \nPhoebee hopes to make a full recovery, but the infection has caused the skin all over her body to dry out and flake off. \nNow recovering at home, she is speaking out to warn other women about the dangers of TSS. \nShe added: “The best advice would be not to use tampons at all, but I know for a lot of people that isn't an option. It's important to make yourself aware of the symptoms and if you do get them, get straight to a hospital. \n“It is better to be safe than sorry. Even if it is a virus, it's better for them to check it out than for you to end up with multiple organ failure.” \nSymptoms of TSS include a high temperature of 39C (102.2F) or above; flu-like symptoms, such as a headache, chills, muscle aches, a sore throat and a cough; feeling and being sick; diarrhoea; a widespread sunburn-like rash; the whites of the eyes, lips and tongue turning a bright red; dizziness or fainting; breathing difficulties; confusion and drowsiness. \nThe NHS said: “TSS is a medical emergency. \n“While these symptoms could be due an illness other than TSS, it's important to contact your GP, local out of hours servicece-auto-ge or NHS 111 as soon as possible if you have a combination of these symptoms. \n“It's very unlikely that you have TSS, but these symptoms shouldn't be ignored.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T14:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:09:53.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
