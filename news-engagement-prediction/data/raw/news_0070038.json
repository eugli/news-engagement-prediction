Best Foreign Language Film \nOne of the nominees for this category won't attend the 2017 Oscars specifically because of Donald Trump's travel ban. \nIranian Asghar Farhadi directed The Salesman and it was originally unclear if he would even be able to enter the US because of the ban. \nHe's since spoken out, saying he won't attend the ceremony no matter what happens with the ban. \nEven if The Salesman doesn't win, this category has been a flashpoint leading up to the ceremony. There were even calls to cancel the Oscars because of the controversy. \nChance it will get political: 10/10. No way this category passes without a comment being made. 2. La La Land wins anything External Link: Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling in La La Land \nThe musical has had all the buzz this awards season. It won seven Golden Globes and is up for 14 Oscars, meaning it'll likely have more chances than most to make a statement. \nOne of the film's producers Jordan Horowitz has already told Entertainment Weekly his acceptance speech will be political. \nMusician John Legend, an executive producer on the film, delivered a blistering attack on Mr Trump at the Producers Guild of America annual awards. \nChance it will get political: 10/10. They've already told us they're champing at the bit to make a point. 3. Zootopia wins Best Animated Feature Join ABC News on Facebook Messenger to make sure you don't miss a thing! Tap here or search \"ABC News\" next time you're in Messenger \nIf you've seen Zootopia, you know exactly what we're talking about. \nBuried beneath all the adorable animation is a subversive message about politicians using fear to create division and win elections. \nSound familiar? \nThe film's creators say they never intended for the film to be a comment on the 2016 presidential campaign (it was in production for years before the campaign began), but it's timeliness didn't go unnoticed. \nChance it will get political: 5/10. There's a chance the creators have said all they want to with the film itself. 4. Meryl Streep wins Best Actress Video: Meryl Streep says Hollywood is \"crawling with foreigners\". (ABC News) \nLet's be honest. Who doesn't want to see Streep vs Trump round two? \nGiven the outpouring of support she had, the Best Actress nominee would probably feel quite comfortable throwing some more shade in the direction of the White House. \nIt will rely on Streep winning the Oscar for Best Actress, a hotly contested category in 2017. \nChance it will get political: 3/10. Meryl needs to get to the podium first. 5. The host's monologue \nHe announced he would take on the coveted gig with a Donald Trump joke . \nYou can bet there'll be more in his opening monologue, but whether it's the kind of biting political commentary Jon Stewart offered up when he took the job is yet to be seen. \nChance it will get political: 8/10. Just don't be disappointed if Kimmel keeps the jokes light. 6. How Far I'll Go wins Best Song \nThis is less about the song itself and more about the man behind it - Lin-Manuel Miranda. \nMiranda is the brains behind the mega-smash musical Hamilton, which was thrust into the spotlight shortly after the election when cast members called out Vice-President Mike Pence from the stage. \nIn an appearance on Saturday Night Live just before the election, Miranda delivered this joke in front of a picture of the president. External Link: Spoiler: He's president now.... \nAwks. \nMiranda hasn't been shy about voicing his disapproval of Mr Trump, so it wouldn't be a stretch for him to make a statement if his song, from the Disney film Moana, wins. \nChance it will get political: 4/10. The song itself isn't political and it's up against some tough competition (La La Land included). 7. A presenter goes rogue \nThe presenters this year include Leonardo DiCaprio, who last year used his Best Actor acceptance speech to make a comment about climate change. \nKate McKinnon, who played Hillary Clinton on Saturday Night Live against Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump, will also present an award. \nThere'll be a teleprompter in front of them telling them what to say, but who knows if they'll stick to it. \nChance it will get political: 6/10. We reckon Leo is the one to watch here. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:16:00.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
