We want to build bridges that unite us and not walls to separate us,\" Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio said in a statement. \nThe comment appeared to be a thinly veiled shot at the new US government, which is traditionally an ally of Peru. \nOpposition supporters take part in a rally against President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas, Venezuela, October 26, 2016. Thomson Reuters \nU.S. President Donald Trump has imposed a temporary entry ban on refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, and insisted that Mexico will pay for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexican border to curb illegal immigration. \nKuczynski, a former Wall Street banker and free-trade advocate who took office last year, has previously compared Trump's proposed border wall to the Berlin Wall, and said he would oppose it in the United Nations. \nKuczynski and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said last week that they would stand with Mexico and seek to strengthen regional trade, in the wake of rising tensions between Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Trump. \nThousands of Venezuelans have left their country in recent years, as a deepening political crisis and ongoing economic dysfunction have made life there ever harder. \nA Venezuelan woman living in Chile, whose mouth is taped, takes part in a protest against the visit of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, in Santiago, March 10, 2014. REUTERS/Cristobal Saavedra \nWhile the first years of this century saw Venezuela elites and educated classes depart the country, chaffing under the presidency of Hugo Chavez, since 2010 younger Venezuelans and members of the middle class have joined the ranks of the exodus. \nMany Venezuelans have relocated to Colombia, and a significant number have gone to Chile, making an arduous multiday trek by bus and boat across the Amazon jungle and the mountains and rivesr of the Andes. \nOver the last five years, Chilean visas issued to Venezuelans have jumped from 758 to 8,381 , Univision reported in September 2016. \nAbout 5% of Venezuelan's roughly 30 million people are thought to have left, and the outflux has undergone a \" feminization \" of late, seeing 67 men leave for every 100 women departing. \n\"I think what you see now is that there are fewer and fewer educated professionals, younger people, who are opting to stay, or even considering opting to stay,\" Alejandro Velasco, a professor at New York University, told Business Insider late last year . \n\"The tipping point basically, I think, has been reached where opportunities outside [the country] are far easier to come by and certainly better to imagine that opportunities inside.\" \n(Reporting by Mitra Taj; Editing by Paul Simao) Read the original article on Reuters .
