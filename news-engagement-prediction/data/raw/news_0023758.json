I find it concerning we're rushing into something we don't fully understand.\" \nSara Ogilvie, policy officer at Liberty, previously told the BBC the hoods were \"cruel, degrading and primitive\" and should never be used on children. \nThe Metropolitan Police Service is consulting on whether to introduce them, but a pilot planned for October was cancelled after London Mayor Sadiq Khan voiced concerns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T14:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T09:32:35.229+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
