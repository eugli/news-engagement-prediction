Jeff Spicer/Getty Images. Kate Middleton and Prince William’s London residence, Kensington Palace, provided a high does of glamour as the location for this year’s BAFTA Nespresso Nominees’ Party. The cocktail party snaked through the hallowed halls of the palace—although this year, it felt a little light on nominees. Your correspondent spotted best actress contenders Amy Adams and Emma Stone , Best Actor nominee Andrew Garfield , and Damien Chazelle , the La La Land writer and director whose film is up for a record 11 nominations. We also couldn’t help but notice how Garfield and Stone spent much of the night in rapture of one another. Could the BAFTAs bring everyone’s favorite couple back together? Hotly tipped to win Sunday’s best actress award, our eyes will be on Garfield and how he takes the award announcement . But judging from last night, she’s certainly still his desert-island pick . Inside the shindig, we stopped to chat with Anya Taylor-Joy , the E.E. rising star award-nominee who has gone from strength to strength with her body of work. From the Netflix film Barry , where she portrays a young Barak Obama’s college girlfriend, to the lead female alongside James McAvoy’s caustic character in M. Night Shyamalans’s Split , the 20 year-old is the name on every casting director’s lips. “I have four films I am working on right now, so it means I will have made 10 films in two years,” says Taylor-Joy, brimming with excitement. “ Witch was my first big film, but M. Night hadn’t even seen it yet when he cast me in Split .” As for where her focus is now? Said Taylor-Joy: “I am a nervous wreck for the Royal Albert Hall tomorrow,” i.e. where the BAFTA film awards will be held. “It’s somewhere I went as a little girl, and now to be going there in a big dress, I really can’t believe it.” The actress then paused before introducing your correspondent to her date for the evening “Oh, this is my dad!” Moving to a new topic of conversation, Taylor-Joy commented on the red-carpet experience. In the current one-degree weather in London, a long stint posing for photographs in a short, sleeveless lace number like the one Taylor-Joy sported is less than ideal. She mimed how she has to talk herself down from the metaphorical ledge: “I’m an actor; it’s not cold. I can do this.” At that, Marden Ade , writer and director of Toni Erdmann —the captivating German film that has earned both a BAFTA and Oscar nomination for best foreign film, and will soon be remade for English-speaking audiences with Jack Nicholson and Kristen Wiig —chimed in. “It’s almost hot. I think I’m sweating,” she added with a laugh, as she mimed fanning her face with her hand. We all laughed—but jokes aside, if Taylor-Joy is able to brave the red carpet in a dress with little more coverage than a nightgown and keep a smile without fail, we’d say that rising star award is all hers.
