But a new name we may have to get used to hearing is: Harold Thomas Martin.\nAccording to Reuters , Martin was taken into custody in August 2016 and is facing 20 criminal counts related to stealing \"highly sensitive government material\" from the US intelligence community. For each count, the maximum prison term is 10 years, meaning if found guilty on all counts he faces up to a 200 year sentence. As Martin is now 52, it unlikely he'll ever experience freedom again if convicted.\nMartin is a former NSA contractor who started out spending four years in the US Navy before becoming a private contractor in 1993. Until 2014 he worked with at least seven companies and several government agencies. Throughout, he was given clearance which allowed access to classified and top secret government files. The last company Martin worked for was Booz Hamilton Holding Corp, which also employed Snowden.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T17:28:47.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
