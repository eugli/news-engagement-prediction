Handanovic will now be represented by Fali Ramadani, who is \"very close\" to City after helping both Matija Nastasic and Stevan Jovetic transfer to the Etihad in 2012 and 2013 , respectively, per Tramacere . City manager Pep Guardiola's interest in bringing the Slovenia international to England is believed to have increased following Handanovic's agent change. City have been plagued with goalkeeping issues ever since Guardiola decided Joe Hart was surplus to requirements at the beginning of the campaign, with Claudio Bravo struggling to adapt to the Premier League. Prior to the 0-0 draw in the FA Cup against Huddersfield, the Chilean had conceded 14 goals from the last 22 shots on target, and he has the worst saves-per-goal ratio in the Premier League, at 1.04. Claudio Bravo Gareth Copley/Getty Images Manchester City are eight points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea , and it is defensive problems that appear to have made the difference this season. They have conceded 29 league goals in 25 matches —11 more than Chelsea, whose goals-for record is only one better than City's 51. As a result, Bravo's position is under threat. He has not featured in any of the last three Premier League games and was on the bench for City's 5-3 victory over AS Monaco in the Champions League on Tuesday, but as recently as Feb. 10, Guardiola referred to the Chilean as \" one of the best in the world,\" per Luke Edwards for the Telegraph . Nevertheless, Guardiola's reported interest in Handanovic, who has made 162 appearances for Inter since signing for the club in 2012, suggests the club are now considering replacing their No. 1. Unfortunately for England's Hart, who is on a season-long loan at Serie A side Torino , this would suggest a second chance will not be forthcoming. Joe Hart Paolo Bruno/Getty Images Hart has been given the green light to join one of City's Premier League rivals this summer as long as they part with more than £20 million, per Paul Hirst for the Times . Both Liverpool and Chelsea are interested in securing his services, according to Neil Fissler for the Express back in December. Either way, it is unlikely Hart will be a Man City player next season, and the same could be true of Bravo. Guardiola's interest in Handanovic undermines the Catalan's positive comments about his 'keeper and is only likely to further damage the Chilean's confidence. With Nicolas Otamendi and John Stones underperforming in defence, more than ever Guardiola needs a reliable and organised goalkeeper. His pursuit of Handanovic would suggest he no longer trusts those currently at his disposal, which may make the situation at City get worse before it gets better. Like the new article format? !
