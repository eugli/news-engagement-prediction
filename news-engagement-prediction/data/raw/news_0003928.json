Staff Photographer Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo (9) and quarterback Dak Prescott (4) talk on the sideline during the second quarter of their game against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday, November 20, 2016 at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. (Ashley Landis/The Dallas Morning News) By SportsDayDFW.com Contact SportsDayDFW.com on Twitter: @SportsDayDFW \nWhatever happens with Tony Romo will have a big impact on fellow Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. \nIf Romo stays, Prescott has a heck of a backup. If he leaves, he'll be a potential obstacle to the Cowboys earning a title next year. \nBut all in all, Prescott says he just wants Romo to be happy. \nSo what does he think Romo should do? \n\"Whatever makes him happy,\" Prescott said Friday on NFL Network's Good Morning Football . \"If he wants to play, he's still got another couple years in him, then I want to see him end up in Denver or on a good team, a team that's said that adding him just makes it that much better. \nHowever, if Romo does leave, Prescott admits things will be at least a little weird. \n\"To me, he's a Cowboy. It would be hard to see that guy in a different uniform.\" \nPrescott also touched on a few other topics in his interview. \nHis Super Bowl LI plans: \n\"I'm just hanging out, enjoying this weekend in Houston. Have some fun, hang out with the teammates that I have here, meet some other guys and just have fun for the most part, soak this all in. I know just being at the stadium lights something inside of you, makes you a little mad and makes you want to go to work that much more. I'm gonna enjoy this week and then go back to work there soon. ...I went out there and looked at the field yesterday and it just fired me up. I'm ready to get back at it.\" \nWho should be the MVP? \nOne of the two guys who's playing in the game this Sunday. Tom [Brady] or Matt [Ryan]. The quarterback position is based on your wins. And if you're playing in the last game of the season, they should give the MVP to one of those guys each and every year. Tom Brady's had one of his best years being at his age. But Matt Ryan is so hot right now. He's got Julio Jones, he's slinging the thing around. So one of those guys, definitely. \nWho has the edge Sunday? \n\"If we're going on edge, I've got to give it to Tom Brady. He's been here before, he broke the record for appearances. Tom Brady's Tom Brady. It's hard for me to pick a winner with Matt Ryan and the Falcons being as hot as they are. But if we're going to say who has the edge, who has the advantage, it's the guy who's been here before.\" \nReflecting on the loss to Green Bay: \n\"I think long term, this loss, it'll help me grow for the rest of my career and it'll help me be better. As great as it would be a rookie quarterback wins the Super Bowl with the year we had, I think the loss is going to serve me better than a win would just from the simple fact it will motivate me for all the years to come. Knowing the great team we had, 13-3, knowing the chemistry we had and to come that short, it shows you how hard it is to win in this league.\" \nOpinion of offensive coordinator Scott Linehan: \n\"He's been everything. I definitely don't have the year that I had if it wasn't for Coach Linehan. We shared texts, he's a great guy. So thankful, so, so, so thankful for him. And I know he battled to draft me, so he's behind me, he's in my corner. I'm out there week in and week out and try to play for him, and I know he's going to call plays that show my strengths. So thankful for him.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T03:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:58:11.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
