Photo by Nestor Corrales/INQUIRER FILE PHOTO \nThe Presidential Security Group (PSG) on Tuesday denied that “excessive force” was used during the rally of human rights victims, which allegedly led to the harassment of some members of the media, in Malacañang on Tuesday morning. \n“There was no excessive force use. Alam ng tropa ang gagawin nila (Our troops know what to do),” PSG spokesperson Michael Aquino said. \nGroups of human rights victims trooped to Malacañang on Tuesday morning to hand a letter to President Rodrigo Duterte through the Presidential Management Staff (PMS). ADVERTISEMENT \nThe group, composed of members of the Samahan ng Ex-detainees Laban sa Detensyon at Aresto (Selda), Desaparecidos, and Hustisya went to Gate 2 of Malacañang near the New Executive Building (NEB) carrying banners saying, “Resume peace talks,” and a letter to Mr. Duterte. \nPSG officers assigned at the gate told the group that holding a rally was prohibited in the area. They also attempted to confiscate the reporters’ cellphones and told them to erase their footage of the event. \n“We all know that Malacañang is a no-rally zone. We have rules,” Aquino said. \nAquino assured that they were investigating the incident amid claims of harassment from members of the media.
