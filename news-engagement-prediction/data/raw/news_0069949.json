Record-breaking temperatures on Feb. 18 and 19, 2017, draw Chicagoans outdoors. Patrick M. O'Connell and Kate Thayer , pointing to abnormal weather trends that make it hotter, colder or wetter than usual. \"It has nothing to do with climate change.\"\nMeteorologists also say the unseasonable temperatures don't mean Chicagoland is in for a snowy spring, as it's hard to predict beyond this month. And, while gardeners may be fretting about what this heat blip will do to their daffodils, the unusual warmth is not likely to have a huge impact on most growth throughout the state. (Editorial Board) \nTuesday and Wednesday were expected to hit up against or break record high temperatures, following a streak of record-setting days, according to the weather service. Monday marked the fourth day in a row in which temperatures either reached the upper 60s or even hit 70 degrees, shattering record highs set decades ago. Tuesday's high at O'Hare was 66 degrees — just a degree shy of breaking the record. Wednesday's forecast called for a 74-degree high; the record for that day is 75 degrees. Meteorologists projected a mild, though not record-breaking Thursday and Friday, but then a 30-degree drop to more normal temperatures this weekend. \n\"It's very extraordinary. I have to keep reminding myself this is February and not March or April. It's kind of weird,\" said Jim Angel, the Illinois state climatologist. \nAngel said it's hard to draw a direct connection between stretches like the past few days and overall climate change because bursts of extreme temperatures are too short to draw deeper conclusions. Illinois has always had great variability in its weather, he said. Chicago River tours begin early thanks to warm weather \nTourists were able to enjoy tours along the Chicago River weeks ahead of schedule because of unseasonably warm weather. Feb. 17, 2017. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) \nTourists were able to enjoy tours along the Chicago River weeks ahead of schedule because of unseasonably warm weather. Feb. 17, 2017. (Jose M. Osorio / Chicago Tribune) See more videos \nA wider snapshot of the state's weather over the last century, however, shows that Illinois winters have warmed 1.8 degrees, Angel said. What's happening, he said, is harsh winters are being replaced with milder ones. The polar vortex winter of 2014 was a notable exception. \nClimate scientist Katharine Hayhoe, professor at Texas Tech University, agrees it's impossible to know if the recent warm spell is because of overall warming trends this past decade across the country — which points to climate change — or a natural, periodic shift in weather. \nStill, \"the reality is any conditions we have these days are different than they would've been 50 or 100 years ago because we've changed background conditions,\" she said, pointing to data that shows there are now more than twice as many record breaking high temperatures compared to a decade ago. \nOne theory, according to scientists, is that less ice cover at the North Pole and Arctic Ocean — due to climate change, scientists say — create more unstable conditions and lead to wild fluctuations in temperatures to the south, Angel said. The most recent balmy weather has been the result of the jet stream staying to the north and the area experiencing a surge of warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. \n\"When you get more mild winters, it's easier for the temperatures to shoot up because you don't have a snow cover, and the ground is warm anyway,\" Angel said. \nIn recent days, the soil across the state has been in the 30s and 40s, not frozen, and that helps temperatures soar. \n\"It feeds on itself,\" Angel said. \nThe unseasonably warm conditions may have ramifications for the state's apple orchards and fields of winter wheat, Angel added. Apple trees may begin to shake out of their dormancy earlier because of the warm temperatures, then suffer when the cold returns, Angel said. Winter wheat, planted in the fall to remain dormant until spring, may also begin to green early only to get blasted when temperatures plummet. \n\"From a farming standpoint, this is not good news,\" Angel said. \nBut, Russ Higgins, educator at the University of Illinois Extension, pointed out that although winter wheat is the state's third largest crop, its acreage across the state is dwarfed by Illinois' leading crops of corn and soy beans. \nHiggins, who can see a crop of winter wheat from his Grundy County office, said he felt \"pessimistic\" about the crop's outlook this season, but said it depends on how low the temperature goes in the coming weeks. \n\"If we don't go much below 20 or 25, we'll probably be OK, but if we happen to pretty quickly drop down colder than that for any length of time, it will probably cause some damage,\" he said. \nThe Morton Arboretum's Plant Clinic in Lisle fielded calls from worried gardeners, wondering about the bulbs they planted last fall and the trees in their yard, said clinic manager and horticulturist Doris Taylor. \nThe consecutive days of warmth have caused buds to sprout on trees and daffodil leaves to pop out of the dirt, Taylor said. Although there has been that stimulation of growth, for the most part, Taylor said, plants should not be significantly affected. \n\"Overall, things will not be damaged,\" she said, pointing out that most people are mistaking tree or leaf buds, which are heartier, for flower buds. And, if there is damage, it likely would just be the tips of the plant or a few buds on the branches of trees. \n\"Don't panic. We'll see what (March) brings,\" she said. \nTim Johnson, director of horticulture at the Chicago Botanic Garden, agreed. Although he's seen the mild weather awake several varieties of early flowering plants, including snowdrops and witch hazel, gardeners should not be too worried because the early blooming or flowering plants are generally cold-tolerant. \n\"The freeze may damage the foliage, but it's really not a concern or anything to worry about in terms of the health of the plant,\" Johnson said. \nIn fact, although it may seem counterintuitive, any upcoming snowfall will benefit plants and perennials, blanketing them in an insulating layer. \n\"The best thing to happen would be to get a six-inch snowfall to cover everything,\" Johnson said. \nFor the most part, people were enjoying the shift in weather. The lunch time scene along the banks of the Chicago River was more April than February. The Riverwalk was abuzz with joggers, dog walkers, tourists on a stroll. Workers in suits and skirts ate salads on park benches, chatted on cellphones, read books or smoked cigarettes with nary a shiver. Michigan Avenue was alive with conventioneers, business people out for fresh air. Shorts were a popular choice among those not at work. \nOn the steps near Columbus Drive, a jacketless Gyasi Gillespie prepared for a walk, taking in the spring-like view of the downtown skyline. \n\"I'm just taking it in, really,\" Gillespie said. \"I think you just gotta enjoy it.\" \nGillespie wasn't worried about any negative ramifications of the warm spell, or concerning himself with what forecasters call the inevitable return of typical winter cold. \n\"I just take it one day at a time in Chicago, man, that's all you can do,\" Gillespie said. \"You never know what tomorrow can bring.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:16:18.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
