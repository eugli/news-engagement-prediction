At the same time, Senate Democrats threw more sand in the gears of the confirmation machinery for Trump nominees. Across Washington, Democrats praised Sally Yates, the Obama holdover and temporary head of the Justice Department fired by Trump after refusing to defend Trump's temporary moratorium stopping non-Americans from entering the United States from seven terrorism-plagued countries. Democratic members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee sent a letter to the president supporting hundreds of State Department employees who have signed a memo on the Department's \"Dissent Channel\" opposing the Trump order.\nAcross the country, in Washington State, Massachusetts, San Francisco, and elsewhere, Democratic state officials initiated or joined lawsuits to challenge Trump's executive order. In California, the Democratic Senate leader introduced legislation to make California a sanctuary state — that is, to go beyond sanctuary cities and have an entire state defy federal immigration law under President Trump .\nMeanwhile, as protests against Trump's executive order continued in spots around the country, the recent Democratic vice-presidential candidate urged Americans to \"fight in the streets\" over the new president's policies. \"What we've got to do is fight in Congress, fight in the courts, fight in the streets, fight online, fight at the ballot box,\" Sen. Tim Kaine told MSNBC Tuesday.\nFinally, as The Resistance organized itself and pushed on multiple fronts, a new supporter spoke up to encourage the protesters — former President Barack Obama , who managed to stay out of his successor's affairs for all of 11 days.\n\" President Obama is heartened by the level of engagement taking place in communities around the country,\" a spokesman said Monday. \"Citizens exercising their constitutional right to assemble, organize and have their voices heard by their elected officials is exactly what we expect to see when American values are at stake.\"\nAs all that was happening, Democrats took to the media to proclaim a \"constitutional crisis\" over Trump's policies.\n\"We are here tonight because it is a constitutional crisis,\" said Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren at a protest outside the Supreme Court Monday night.\n\"A constitutional crisis,\" said Democratic Sen. Cory Booker as he joined demonstrators at Dulles Airport Saturday night.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Trump administration reverses itself on military targeting US citizens overseas \nThe Trump administration walked back its position on whether the military would target U.S. citizens overseas with ties to extremists.\nHours after White House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that \"no American citizen will ever be targeted\" in overseas operations, a White House official clarified.\nIt turns out \"U.S. policy regarding the possible targeting of American citizens has not changed.\"\nThe official cited former Attorney General Eric Holder's legal justification for using lethal force against American citizens who are suspected terrorists, according to The Hill.\nThe military could kill a suspected terrorist who has U.S. citizenship if the government believes the person is an \"imminent\" threat\nBy Caitlin Yilek • 01/31/17 10:25 PM \"A constitutional crisis,\" said Virginia Democratic Rep. Don Beyer when he arrived at Dulles Sunday.\nAt the same time, Democrats attempted to link Trump's firing of Yates with Richard Nixon's \"Saturday Night Massacre\" during Watergate.\n\"A Monday night massacre,\" said Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer.\n\"Nixonian,\" tweeted Democratic Rep. John Conyers.\n\"Nixonian,\" said Lawrence O'Donnell, the former Democratic Hill aide now on MSNBC.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Obama solicitor general lavishes praise on Trump Supreme Court pick \"Judge Gorsuch is one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century.\"\nBy Ryan Lovelace • 01/31/17 10:20 PM Democrats aren't just venting. Their actions, taken together, have a number of strategic intentions. The first is to distract, and do whatever damage it can, to the Trump administration as it tries to get on its feet. Second is to constrain the White House and create a sense among voters and potential Trump supporters that enacting the president's agenda will come at an enormous cost in peace and public safety. On Tuesday night, for example, news broke that Trump will not visit Harley Davidson headquarters in Milwaukee Thursday, as planned, because the company feared protests.\nA third purpose is to keep the Trump administration weak; the longer the Justice Department has no attorney general, for example, the less able it will be to defend the many Trump initiatives that will come under legal challenge.\nTo that end, on Capitol Hill Tuesday, Democrats used delaying tactics to extend their blockade of some Trump cabinet nominees. Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee boycotted a meeting at which they were scheduled to vote on the nominations of Treasury Secretary-designate Steven Mnuchin and Health and Human Services Secretary-designate Tom Price. (Committee rules require that at least one member from each party be present to conduct business.)\nRepublicans sputtered in frustration but didn't exactly promise to crack down. \"We're going to do this again,\" Finance Committee chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch said, \"and see if they will come and do the job that they've been elected and sworn to do. I'm very disappointed.\" Meanwhile, the path forward for Mnuchin and Price was not clear.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee met Tuesday, ostensibly to vote on the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions to be attorney general. Committee Democrats, who plan to vote unanimously against Sessions, talked and talked and talked — and then cited a seldom-invoked rule that a committee meeting cannot run more than two hours past the start of Senate business. Sessions was left waiting until Wednesday, when committee chairman Sen. Charles Grassley vowed to hold a vote.\nTrump nominees will be slowly confirmed, well behind the pace of earlier administrations, in coming weeks and months. But the Democratic offensive will likely intensify — perhaps resembling a national version of the desperate Democratic protests against Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker when Walker's agenda threatened key Democratic constituencies in 2011.\nWalker won that fight, but only after Democrats threw everything they had at him. Trump can expect no less.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:05:09.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
