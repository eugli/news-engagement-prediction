(Dougie Stew) \nThe video begins with a clip of a train passenger balancing a bagel on her head before cutting to an argument between two young women. \nThe pair yell and leap at each other in the aisles as other travellers intervene to try and break up the fight. \nA man is then seen becoming increasingly cross as a group of people sitting behind him pester him with bagels. \nLater, passengers in the carriage can be heard chanting: “He’s got a bagel on his head” while passengers cheer and clap along. 'Bagelgate': The video footage shows a group of passengers putting bagels on a man's head. (Dougie Stew) \nHe eventually snaps and tells a fellow passenger: “F*** off, get the f*** out my face.\" \nThe video ends with another brawl between a group of people throwing punches on the platform at Potters Bar station. \nPolice are seen boarding the train as the carriage becomes hushed and passengers sit in silence. \nPassenger Dougie Stew, 25, recorded the footage on the Great Northern service as he travelled home from London to Hatfield in Hertfordshire. \nHe told the Standard: “There were two different events going on. One was a verbal then physical fight between two groups of girls, the other was an onslaught of bagels to a random guy’s head. Fight: Passengers get involved to try and stop the fight. (Dougie Stew) \n“It seemed like the girls behind him had a never ending amount of bagels on them to the enjoyment of the rest of the carriage but not to the poor guy.” \nHe added: “Then it all kicked off at Potters Bar where another group started fighting and took some of the lads outside to settle their differences. \n“We were held at the station by police for about half an hour until it was all resolved.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T20:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T15:35:33.477+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
