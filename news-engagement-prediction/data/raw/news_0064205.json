(AAP) \nHird adds: \"They're a pack of f---ing lying p and they have done from the start.\" \nLittle spoke about how angry he was that McLachlan appeared to have \"gone back\" on his word. \n\"I rang him last night and I said, 'You know you've really upset me here, because you've gone back on your word, Gil'. \n\"He said, 'No, no I haven't, I haven't.' I said 'You have. You told me one thing, and now you're doing something else'.\" \nThe newspaper reports Corcoran, Thompson, Hird and Little gave their approval for the once-secret tape to be released to the public. \nFive days after its recording, Hird, Thompson, Corcoran and Reid were all charged by the AFL with brining the game into disrepute. \nEssendon was slapped with a $2 million fine, wasn’t allowed to play in the finals and was stripped of draft picks. \nThe release of the tape has promoted federal Labor MP Kimberley Kitching to join a push for a senate inquiry into the conduct of the AFL and ASADA. \n\"It is clear mistakes were made by regulators and other and those mistakes must never be repeated,\" Senator Kitching told the Herald. © Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:30:07.339+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
