Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017 \n”Sorry, ISIS,” said Colbert. “If you want to get on the list, you gotta publish photos of Trump’s inauguration crowd. Then he’ll be really, really angry at you.” \nColbert pointed out how Senator John McCain criticized the comments, saying that you need a “free and many times adversarial press” to preserve democracy. \n“Without it, I’m afraid that we would lose so much of our individual liberties over time. That’s how dictators get started,” said McCain. \nThat sounds bigly scary, but Colbert helped explain McCain’s comment. \n“Just to be clear, he’s not saying Trump is a dictator. He’s saying getting rid of the free press is how dictators get started, OK? He’s not calling him a full dictator. He’s more bite-size. He’s a dictator-tot,” said Colbert.
