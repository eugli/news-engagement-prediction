Brandon Creighton, the author of the bill, said allowing the lawsuits could encourage doctors to seek out every possible disability and even promote abortions to avoid litigation. He also said he takes issue with the idea that there are \"wrongful\" births.\n\"Children born with disabilities ought to have the same rights as any abled person,\" said Creighton, R-Conroe. \"Their rights are just as important as others.\"\nNine states have enacted bans on wrongful-birth lawsuits, including Arizona, South Dakota and Indiana. In Texas, medical malpractice attorneys say the lawsuits are rare, even nonexistent.\n\"The thing is, I've practiced medical malpractice for 30 years and I have never brought one of these,\" said Kay Van Wey, an attorney in Dallas. \"I know all the other experienced medical malpractice lawyers in Dallas, and I don't know any of them who have brought these lawsuits.\"\nDouglas Wood, another Dallas attorney, said the cases are rare because finding an expert witness, assessing damages and trying to find a sympathetic jury would probably deter an attorney from taking them.\n\"I don't think anybody would handle a case like that,\" he said. \"I guess it's theoretically possible.\"\nWrongful-birth lawsuits are different than wrongful-pregnancy cases, in which women can sue physicians if they become pregnant after receiving an operation to prevent them from having children. They're also different from wrongful-life suits, which are brought on behalf of disabled children and aren't recognized in Texas.\nLast year, a Senate committee invited testimony on wrongful-birth lawsuits from the public in preparation for this year's legislative session. A representative from the Texas Medical Board told the panel it has received only five complaints relating to wrongful birth in the past decade, three of which were dismissed.\nMargaret Johnson, a representative with the Texas League of Women Voters, said the bill would put a woman's right to have an abortion at risk.\n\"These cases are rare but are appropriate redress for parents in such situations,\" she said. \"Eliminating the wrongful-birth claim is an unreasonable restriction on the constitutional right of a woman, in consultation with her physician and family members, to make an informed decision about whether or not to have an abortion.\"\nRep. Ron Simmons, who is carrying the bill in the House, said while he sees the measure as a \"pro-life\" priority, it would protect doctors from unjust litigation.\n\"This is a pro-life bill that is really a bill to protect our doctors in cases where, for whatever reason, they didn't see a disability, and to keep them from being sued,\" said Simmons, R-Carrollton. \"My understanding is that there may have been a couple of cases filed in this in the past, and it hasn't been something that's been a rampant problem here in Texas. This pre-empts there being a problem, we hope.\"\nJoe Pojman, executive director of Texas Alliance for Life, told senators Monday that the bill would prevent lawsuits that \"make physicians accountable for disabilities they had no part in creating.\"\nSimmons said his problem is with the framing of wrongful-birth suits, which he said focus on the fact that parents were deprived of the opportunity to choose to have an abortion.\n\"The idea of suing for wrongful birth is hard for me to get my arms around, and it should not be a cause of action,\" Simmons said. \"It could be that [a doctor] didn't meet the standard of care, but them saying that 'I should have been able to abort my baby' is not OK.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:44:35.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
