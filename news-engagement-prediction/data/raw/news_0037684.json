Another listing for the Florida house which was used in a fraudulent Airbnb listing. \nMs Rickard said home-sharing platforms such as Airbnb would be wise to conduct reverse Google image searches on property listings. \n\"These image searches are one of the things we encourage dating sites to do on all profile pictures. We certainly encourage online booking sites to do something similar.\" SHARE Share on Twitter Link ACCC deputy chairwoman Delia Rickard says the sharing economy has a responsibility to maintain \"appropriate safeguards\" for consumers. \nIn the case of the Bondi \"luxury villa,\" the first warning bells rang for this reporter upon reading the property's description. \n\"PLEASE do not book before you contact me! All the bookings made without prior contact will be canceled! [sic],\" it read. \nA response to a further inquiry stated that payment could be made through the Airbnb app, but not before personal details such as a full name, address, ID and utility bill had been provided. \nIn another example seen by Fairfax Media, an Australian consumer was also urged to email a property owner to make a booking, instead of using the app. \nThis led to the consumer mistakenly using a wire transfer service to send more than $5000 to an identity masquerading as the property host of a European ski chalet, after receiving highly realistic emails purportedly from Airbnb. \nThe consumer later discovered the property's true address was in another country to that advertised. \nAn Airbnb Australia spokeswoman said its global Trust and Safety team \"worked 24/7\" to respond to issues raised by guests and hosts and prevent fraud. \n\"Airbnb will never ask you to pay the cost of a reservation off-site or through email. The bottom line is when you book a reservation through our secure platform, you receive the benefits of Airbnb's global trust and safety team ,\" she said. \n\"More than 150 million guests have had safe, positive experiences on Airbnb and negative incidents are extremely rare. We proactively educate our new guests on the importance of keeping their bookings strictly on the Airbnb platform...\" \nThe home-sharing platform would not comment on how many fake property listing reports it had received in the past year, nor whether it conducted Google reverse image searches. \nAfter being contacted by Fairfax Media, Airbnb removed the Bondi \"luxury villa\" listing from the website, banning the relevant host from the platform. \nIn 2015 the ACCC became one of 60 member countries in the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network. \nLast year the network released a set of guidelines relating to safe online reviews and endorsements, such as those published in relation to accommodation and other travel related products. \nMs Rickard said that while the guidelines did not specifically comment on fraudulent listings, the message to the sharing economy was the same. \n\"The sharing economy holds itself as a safe alternative to business, therefore it has an obligation to have appropriate safeguards in place.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T11:33:42.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
