Since Democrats are insisting all available debate time is used, they are forcing Republicans to keep the Senate open late night this week so a final vote can occur Wednesday, according to GOP aides. Some of Trump's picks did advance Tuesday. Education nominee Betsy DeVos was cleared by the Senate education committee, despite a move by Democrats to invalidate the vote after it happened. Energy nominee Rick Perry and Interior Department pick Ryan ZInke were voted out of the energy committee. On the floor, Elaine Chao, McConnell's wife, was overwhelmingly confirmed to run the Transportation Department. But contributing to the lack of comity between the parties, Schumer was one of six Democrats to vote against the GOP leader's spouse. The move rankled some Republicans and raised questions about the ability of Schumer and McConnell to get along. An aide to McConnell told CNN that the GOP leader was surprised and not happy by this \"shot across the bow.\" Schumer said he voted against Chao because she hadn't publicly stated her position on Trump's controversial immigration executive order issued this week, tying the fight over the confirmations to the latest flashpoint coming out of the White House. \"She has not, so I voted against her, and I will vote against every nominee who does not,\" Schumer said. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, described Schumer as typically a pragmatist on nominations but said he was being pulled to the left by the \"Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren faction of the party.\" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, had another explanation. He said Democrats are blocking nominations because they have a \"mob mentality\" now because they are frustrated and filled with emotion, similar to the way Republicans were when they shut down the government over Obamacare. CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Ashley Killough and Tom LoBianco contributed to this report.
