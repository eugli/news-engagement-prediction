It’s still all a part of the evaluation process. “We'll continue to evaluate our program.” \n(What's next for the Vols?

That evaluation cannot elapse much more time whatsoever for Jones & the Vols’ football program --- even as time creeps by in the school’s search for Jones’ new boss as vice chancellor and director of athletics. Veteran Jones staffers Steve Stripling and Don Mahoney , Tennessee’s defensive and offensive line coaches, respectively, are on expiring contracts at month’s end.Sources have continued to indicate to 247Sports both last week and this week, from Oregon, Georgia and on Rocky Top, that Tennessee is making arrangements to add Brady Hoke to Jones’ staff. Remember, Hoke is a longtime friend of Jones and spent nearly a week in Knoxville during fall 2015, during which time Hoke stayed with Jones.As for Mahoney, the NCAA’s decision to table a further vote on adding a 10th on-field assistant coach at the Football Bowls Subdivision level muddies the future of the longtime Jones assistant coach. Both Mahoney and current off-field staffer Walt Wells are considered candidates to remain on the Vols’ staff as Tennessee’s full-time offensive line coach. When the Vols were down a coach last month, Wells is the guy Jones dispatched onto the recruiting trail.
