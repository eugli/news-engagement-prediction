Sign Harris is a black British actress. Slate is Jewish.\nDuke is a Holocaust denier who became increasingly outspoken in his support for Donald Trump during the run-up to the presidential election.\nEvans wasn’t having it:\nI don't hate them. That's YOUR method. I love. Try it. It's stronger than hate. It unites us. I promise it's in you under the anger and fear https://t.co/RGnH4rrblq\n— Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) February 13, 2017\nAdvertisement\nEvans continued tweeting:\nWe can't let hatred be the loudest voice. https://t.co/bqRPRXo453\n— Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) February 9, 2017\nEvans hasn’t been shy about sharing his feelings about Duke. After Duke tweeted support of Attorney General Jeff Sessions , Evans had this to say:\nIf David Duke....DAVID!...DUKE!... thinks you're right, then you are unequivocally wrong. The confirmation of @jeffsessions is beyond words. https://t.co/CuLUznwO6S\n— Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) February 9, 2017\nHeather Ciras can be reached at heather.ciras@globe.com .
