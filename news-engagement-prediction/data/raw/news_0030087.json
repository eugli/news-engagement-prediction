It turned out to be Adele, a fellow iconic British pop star. The singer took the stage for a new arrangement of Michael's \"Fastlove,\" but stopped mid-performance to restart. \"I'm sorry, I can't do it again like last year,\" she apologized on stage as the music eventually stopped behind her. \"I'm sorry for swearing, and I'm sorry for starting again. Could we please start it again? I'm so sorry. I can't mess this up for him. I'm sorry, I can't.\" (Her mention of \"last year\" was a reference to her performance of \"All I Ask\" at the 2016 Grammys, where she was criticized for shaky vocals.)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T05:23:55.953+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
