A source told The Telegraph: 'You are talking about a plot to disrupt or take over a government in some way. You can't imagine that there wasn't some kind of approval process.' A special prosecutor in the former Yugoslav republic said in November that a group of 'Russian nationalists' had planned to assassinate Djukanovic to get an opposition party into power.

Some 20 people - including two Russian citizens - have been suspected of participating in the October plot. Predrag Bogicevic and Nemanja Ristic were arrested in January over the alleged plot, while Russians Eduard Shirokov and Vladimir Popov remain on Interpol's wanted list. Montenegro's special prosecutor has urged the national assembly to lift the immunity of two senior opposition leaders allegedly involved in the attempted coup. Predrag Bogicevic and Nemanja Ristic (left and second left) were arrested in January over the alleged plot.

The spokeswoman said: 'Montenegro must itself deliver a competent, transparent judicial process and trial of the coup suspects. 'Success would be a major step in convincing the international community of real progress in Montenegrin rule of law reform and compatibility with NATO and EU standards.'
