The world was taken aback at how the lighting and mirrors in eleven big-brand fitting rooms from Zara to Mango made her look different in each one. FEMAIL wanted to see whether the same was true on the British high street so we sent Lydia Jones, a 25-year-old size 8 fashion entrepreneur from Birmingham, and Gina Clarke, 30, a size 16 writer and mother-of-two from Hampshire, to their local shopping centres to investigate. Lydia, who runs wantherwardrobe.com, and Gina, first took photographs at home and then in an array of popular shops, from M&S to New Look, with staggering results. Not only did the ladies' skintones, hair colour and features look totally different in each shop but the different mirrors transformed Gina's figure, too. Meanwhile, certain mirrors enhanced Lydia's chest and made her waist appear trimmer. Ultimately, these photographs go to show just how crucial it is that shops get the right lighting and mirrors that will be most flattering to the customers. HOME Gina Clarke, 30, a size 16 writer and mother-of-two from Hampshire, took to her local shopping centre to investigate. Here she is pictured at home in front of her own mirror TOPSHOP The spotlights overhead in the Topshop changing room (right) cast dark shadows so Gina doesn't feel her best (pictured at home, left). The lighting certainly seemed to make her figure appear trimmer and more toned H&M Gina (left, at home) admits H&M's changing rooms are very 'film star' and the lighting creates a nipped in waist. 'My complexion is picture perfect but I feel I look fake and I'm not a fan as there's no way to know how it will look when I get home,' she said (right) M&S Gina (pictured at home, left) was impressed by the 'nice, bright changing room with storage space for your belongings' at M&S (right). 'I feel it makes me look like I do in real life with a bit of extra, helpful light,' she said. The lighting didn't alter her figure hugely compared to some of the other fitting rooms PHASE EIGHT Gina (pictured at home, left) couldn't understand why the outside of the changing room was beautifully lit at Phase Eight. The inside lighting was so unflattering she felt 'sad' for her 'dull reflection (right). Her figure was totally transformed by the mirrors and lighting, though DEBENHAMS Gina (pictured, left, at home) felt that Debenhams' changing room reflected her natural look, which is what she wants when out shopping (right). She didn't think it altered her body shape hugely NEW LOOK Gina at her Hampshire home before heading out to the shops (left) and in the changing room at New Look (right). Despite 'movie star door hangers' and custom pegs Gina felt like was in the 'back of a warehouse' thanks to the bad lighting. Her reflection was fairly close to the photo she took at home ANN SUMMERS Gina (pictured, left, at home) doesn't feel the overly pink look of the Ann Summers changing rooms creates a flattering glow. 'The ginormous mirror means you can see your wobbly bits in all their glory. No special lighting either so it’s a little \"too real\" for me,' she said (right) LAURA ASHLEY Gina (left, at home) was impressed by Laura Ashley's nice decor (right) with lots of details such as other smaller mirrors in the changing room to reflect the light. 'I feel like I’m getting an accurate sense of \"me\" with a bit of soft lighting to take away some of the harsher points,' she said. Indeed, the mirrors made her body appear toned JOULES At Joules, Gina (pictured, left, at home) was disappointed to find the changing room was quite dark with only lights outside the curtain and said it made her feel 'frumpy' (right). Her face did, however, appear remarkably thinner WHITE STUFF Gina (left, at home) said the beautiful drapes and warm lighting in the White Stuff changing rooms were very flattering. 'I’m pleasantly surprised by how the lights bring a warmth to my skin,' she said. Her waist appeared more nipped-in, too NEXT The writer (pictured, left, at home) is 'pleasantly surprised' by the smooth silhouette she sees in the mirror at Next (right), saying that light panels down the side of the mirrors and a heavy curtain makes the lighting quite flattering, despite not being a fan of the back mirror GINA'S VERDICT 'Overall changing rooms are not the most pleasant places to be. But with shops taking into account larger, functional spaces they are generally getting better. 'On this shopping trip I thought the lighting in H&M went too far – although it great for a quick selfie! 'But I felt I was looking more at my now flawless skin, and less on the outfit. On the other side of the scale I think New Look need a lot more investment in their lights if they want their clothes to look as good on the body as they do on the rail. 'There were some nice touches in the changing room but the lighting really is terrible, like the back of a warehouse. 'Top of the bunch comes Next and M&S, with M&S taking the lead in my book for their well lit changing area which gave me a more natural look, which is what I like to see when I'm trying on something new. 'After all who wants a trek back in to town to return an item you've already tried on and liked? 'Although I thank Next for adding the soft lighting and beautiful drapes, but I prefer to see a true reflection of what I'm buying so there are no surprises when I get home.' HOME Lydia Jones, 25, from Birmingham, first took a photograph in the mirror at home, pictured, and then in an array of popular shops, from Zara to New Look, with staggering results TOPSHOP Lydia, left at home, found the lighting 'super yellow' in Topshop, right. She noted that this is designed to make you look more tanned DEBENHAMS Lydia, left, at home, was impressed with the lighting in Debenhams, right. She said it was subtly lit, which highlighted her skin and made her waist look trimmer M&S Lydia, left, at home, found M&S, right, to be the worst of the whole high street. She felt that the bizarre green lighting made her look bigger than her trim size 8 frame H&M Lydia, left, at home, said they had lights around the back of the mirror in H&M, right, to act as a ring light, which she said gives a more flattering finish and is a technique bloggers often employ to enhance their pictures RIVER ISLAND Lydia, left, at home, was a fan of the lighting in River Island, right, which she thought was 'extremely bright' and flattering on her skintone and curves. Lydia noted that River Island was her favourite fitting room PRIMARK Despite it's purse-friendly price tags and reputation, Lydia, left, at home, was impressed with Primark's fitting rooms, right. The fashion entrepreneur said she liked the way the lighting highlighted her features and she felt her chest looked more prominent ANN SUMMERS Lydia, left, at home, and, right, in Ann Summers, was nonplussed about their fitting rooms. She noticed that her hair looked brighter and her skin was more radiant but didn't feel they made too much of a difference to her appearance BOUX AVENUE Lingerie giant Boux Avenue clearly take their fitting rooms very seriously with separate day and night light settings. Lydia, left, at home, and, right, in the lingerie store, was a huge fan of Boux's flattering lighting WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY Dr Melissa Kao, director of Magic Mirror, told the Daily Mail: ‘Shops sometimes employ tiny tricks to make you look as good as possible, which include tilting mirrors upwards. This elongates the look of the body. ‘The mirror may appear flat against the wall — but even a tilt of just a couple of millimetres can be enough to give a bit of extra length to the legs.’ Dr Kao also says mirrors may have slightly different tints, some of which will give the face a more healthy glow: ‘Shops often use a “ring flash” where strip lighting creates a halo effect — much like you’d see in those old-fashioned make-up mirrors set with bulbs. 'It gives a shadow-free reflection and an even complexion.' THE BLOGGER WHO WENT VIRAL Inna took to her Russian blog Adme to post the photographs comparing how she looks at home and then again in each fitting room - and the differences are incredibly striking. In some pictures her face appears to be slimmer, while in others her skin appears more blemish-free. She tried out popular shops including H&M, Mango and Zara, among others, and wore the same outfit in each picture.
