By Cole Delbyck \nWorld, meet Golden “Sagon” Cannon. Golden “Sagon” Cannon, meet world. \nNick Cannon has bestowed a name upon his newborn son befitting his glamorous extended family. Although Cannon’s ex-wife, Mariah Carey , is not the mother of Golden, something tells us they’re going to get along just fine. \nOn Tuesday, the former “America’s Got Talent” host welcomed a son with his longtime friend and former Miss Arizona USA Brittany Bell. Cannon posted a sweet black-and-white photo of himself holding Golden to announce the news that he is now a dad three times over. \n“Weeping may endure for a night, but Joy cometh in the morning! No matter how hard the world may hit you, God always reminds us of our purpose!” Cannon wrote in the caption. \n“Welcome to the earth son,” he added, along with the hashtags #TrueHappiness and #Awakened. A post shared by LORD NCREDIBLE ALMIGHTY 🕉IkeT🆙 (@nickcannon) on Feb 22, 2017 at 10:22am PST \nCannon is also dad to his and Carey’s 5-year-old twins, Moroccan and Monroe. The superstar reportedly congratulated Cannon on the newest addition to his family, as the two continue to successfully co-parent after their divorce. \nIf Cannon gets his way, his children will soon be joined by a slew of siblings. During a recent interview with Power 106 Los Angeles , he explained that in a perfect world his family would continue to expand regardless of his relationship status. \n“I wanted it to be with someone who was solid, spiritual and had the same views,” Cannon said of his connection with Bell, whom he confirmed was pregnant in December . “She’s been in my life. Our families grew up in the same projects together in San Diego. So, there’s a lot of substance there.” \n“I always wanted five kids,” he added. “Just because my marriage was over didn’t mean I couldn’t continue to grow a family.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:02:36.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
