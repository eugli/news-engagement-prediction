The state is also asking for a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the order.\n'We are a country based on the rule of law, and in a courtroom it is not the loudest voice that prevails, it's the Constitution,' Ferguson said. 'At the end of the day, either you're abiding by the Constitution or you are not. And in our view, the president is not adhering to the Constitution when it comes to this executive action.'\nSara Lopez, of Seattle, holds a sign as she attends a Seattle City Council meeting in Seattle. Council members passed a resolution Monday reaffirming that Seattle is a 'welcoming city' that treats residents equally regardless of their refugee or immigration status\nTechnology companies Amazon.com Inc and Expedia Inc, both of which are based in Washington state's Seattle area, will support the state's suit, Ferguson said.\nAnother Washington state company, Microsoft Corp, said it has been cooperating with the attorney general's office to provide information about the order's impact 'in order to be supportive.'\n'To our employees in the U.S. and around the world who may be directly affected by this order, I want you to know that the full extent of Amazon's resources are behind you,' Amazon.com Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a note to employees.\nThe complaint claims that Trump's actions are separating Washington families, harming thousands of state residents, damaging the state economy, hurting Washington-based companies 'and undermining Washington's sovereign interest in remaining a welcoming place for immigrants and refugees,' Ferguson said.\nWashington state Governor Jay Inslee said the 'inhumanity' of Trump's order is obvious.\n'This is un-American, it is wrong, and it will not stand,' Inslee said. 'The clear intent of this executive order is to discriminate against one faith amongst all God's children.'\nA man holds a sign during a protest held in response to President Donald Trump's travel ban, in Seattle, Washington\nAsked if he fears retaliation from the Trump administration, Inslee said 'there's no predicting this president, but we will not yield, we will not be leveraged, we will not be threatened, we will not be intimidated.'\nInslee said he learned the hard way over the years 'you do not back down to bullies.'\nFerguson said he has been in contact with other attorneys general but at this point Washington state was acting on its own regarding the legal action.\nThe Port of Seattle said over the weekend that people who were detained at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport as a result of Trump's order have been released.\nU.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal said Sunday that two individuals were released. One is a citizen of Sudan and the other a citizen of Yemen, both countries named in Trump's order.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-01-31T04:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:02:30.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
