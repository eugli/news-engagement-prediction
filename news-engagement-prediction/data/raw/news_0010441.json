T-Mobile is hoping to push some of these handsets out the door by offering a new Netflix promo, one that’ll no doubt appeal to the movie-lovers and deal seekers out there: an entire year of Netflix on the house. \nIf you don’t mind being a T-Mobile subscriber, and you don’t mind owning the Galaxy S7 or S7 edge instead of waiting for the upcoming Galaxy S8, then you can get a year of Netflix from the Uncarrier via its new promotional offer. The offer is only available until February 7, though, so you have to make up your mind posthaste. \nSays T-Mobile, to get the Netflix perk, customers need to pick up either the Galaxy S7 or the Galaxy S7 edge from T-Mobile. All the related down payments and sales tax will need to be paid, obviously, after which point the phone will need to be registered with Samsung Promotions’ Winter Netflix promo. A copy of the receipt will need to be uploaded. \nAfter registering the phone and sending the receipt to Samsung, buyers will then receive a single-use code that can be entered on Netflix’s Special Offers page. Entering that code will credit your Netflix account with a full year of service, but only if you redeem the code by March 31 of this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:51:12.632+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
