But at the Court of Appeal yesterday, Barci, of Northolt, West London, challenged the decision. The convicted murderer, currently in custody, was not in court as his barrister Ben Cooper argued his proposed extradition to Albania would be in breach of three articles of the European Convention on Human Rights, right to life, ban on torture and fair trial. After a Daily Mail investigation exposed the case, a district judge ruled he should be extradited. But at the Court of Appeal, Barci, of West London, challenged the decision After a Daily Mail investigation exposed the case, a district judge ruled he should be extradited. But at the Court of Appeal, Barci, of West London, challenged the decision It was claimed on his behalf that the Albanian judicial system was ‘endemically and systematically tainted by corruption’. Mr Cooper, an expert on extradition and human rights, claimed the judges who found Barci guilty in his absence of the murders were ‘implicated in corruption’. The Court of Appeal was told that extradition should be barred because of a real risk to Barci’s life in Albania as a result of a blood feud. The barrister added: ‘The culture of its prisons is considered inhumane and degrading. Cold cells, absence of natural light and less than two metres living space.’ The Court of Appeal was told that extradition should be barred because of a real risk to Barci’s life in Albania as a result of a blood feud However, Daniel Sternberg, on behalf of the Republic of Albania, which contested the appeal, submitted that Barci’s retrial would be conducted in the Albanian appeal court and not by the judges who originally tried the case. ‘There has not been any proven allegations or active allegations of corruption against the judges,’ he said. He added that there was no corroboration for the claims relating to a blood feud, lack of protection or lack of assurance. ‘These submissions are built on sand,’ he told the appeal judges. Barci is said to have lured his two victims to their deaths in the city of Burrel, northern Albania. He fled the country in the wake of the killings but in his absence was sentenced to 25 years in 2009. He was arrested here in July 2015. Judgement in his appeal bid was reserved yesterday.
