an end as Schalke battled to a 1-1 draw at the Allianz Arena.\nRobert Lewandowski fired Bayern in front after just nine minutes, which seemed to set them up for what would have been a ninth straight victory in all competitions.\nBut the home side could defend their advantage for only four minutes as Arturo Vidal brought down Guido Burgstaller 20 yards out and Brazilian defender Naldo cracked in the free-kick.\nPhilipp Lahm made his 500th competitive appearance for Bayern when coming on as a 77th-minute substitute and could have seen his team secure a late winner, but Javi Martínez shot wide at the far post.\nDespite the dropped points, Bayern extended their advantage over RB Leipzig to four points after their title rivals lost 1-0 at Borussia Dortmund , who move up to third.\nPierre-Emerick Aubameyang netted the only goal on 35 minutes when the Gabon forward, who came back after the hosts’ early exit from the Africa Cup of Nations, headed in after a thrilling run and cross from winger Ousmane Dembélé.\nDortmund could have further pressed home their advantage in the second half, with Aubameyang and Marco Reus both failing to make the most of good chances.\nHoffenheim are alongside Dortmund on 34 points after they beat Mainz 4-0 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena. Mark Uth volleyed the home side into an early lead in the fourth minute but it was not until late on when Hoffenheim finally made sure of the result.\nSubstitute Marco Terrazzino added a second with nine minutes left, before Adam Szalai’s late double added a gloss to the final scoreline.\nHertha Berlin saw off Ingolstadt 1-0 at the Olympiastadion, where the game’s only goal came inside the first two minutes. Salomon Kalou broke down the left flank before his cross was sent past goalkeeper Martin Hansen by Genki Haraguchi, the Japan forward’s first goal of the season enough to end a two-match losing streak.\nCologne also kept up their top-six challenge with a 1-0 win over Wolfsburg thanks to a late penalty from Anthony Modeste. Konstantin Rausch had seen a corner curl against the Wolfsburg crossbar in the second half, while at the other end Luiz Gustavo headed over.\nThe Frenchman Modeste, though, produced the decisive moment when he scored from the spot with just nine minutes left having been fouled for the penalty.\nBorussia Mönchengladbach continued their unbeaten run under their new coach, Dieter Hecking, with a 3-0 victory over Freiburg .\nCaptain Lars Stindl opened the scoring on 73 minutes when his shot went in off the post, before Brazilian frontman Raffael doubled the lead from close range five minutes later and substitute Patrick Herrmann added a third in injury time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:57:17.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
