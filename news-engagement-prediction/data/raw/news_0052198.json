As a candidate, Trump's tough talk on immigration and trade relations mobilized voters, but as president it has increased tension with U.S. allies and created headaches for diplomats, foreign policy experts said.

It's when a Big Ten school plays a small college in preseason and wins by 40 points. This shouldn't be a hard thing. The president has made it very hard,\" Richard Stengel, a former State Department official under Secretary John Kerry, said on MSNBC. \nTrump announced his candidacy in June 2015 by promising to build a wall on the country's southern border that would be paid for by Mexico, a pledge that became the rallying cry of his campaign. He claimed Mexico was sending rapists and drugs over the border and tweeted in June 2015 the country \"is not our friend.\" \nIt led to a level of hostility between the normally reliable southern ally not seen in decades. \nShortly after Trump took office he reportedly sparred with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the leader of an American ally. Both Turnbull and Trump disputed reports of the heated exchange over a refugee agreement . \nStill, the Australian ambassador to the U.S. was dispatched to meet with White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon in the days following the call. \nAnd Vice President Mike Pence met with Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop on Tuesday, a conversation in which the two \"reaffirmed\" the strong alliance between the nations, according to a White House readout. Tillerson further reaffirmed that alliance during his meeting with the foreign minister on Wednesday. \nIt has all led to messy diplomatic relations with countries the U.S. has had close and friendly relationships with, foreign policy experts said. \n\"Clearly the relationship between Mexico and the United States is the worst it's been in 25 years and at a time when we have great cooperation with Mexico both on economics, as well as national security this is something that has to be mended and I think both Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Kelly are the ones to deliver the message and to try to get It back on track,\" James Jones, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico under President Clinton, told MSNBC. \nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer on Wednesday denied that the Tillerson trip to Mexico with Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly is an effort to repair any ill will created by the new president and called the relationship between the two countries \"phenomenal right now.\" \n\"I would argue that we have a very healthy and robust relationship with the Mexican government and Mexican officials,\" Spicer told reporters during the daily press briefing. \"And I think they would echo that same sentiment.\" Play Spicer Calls U.S.-Mexico Relations 'Phenomenal' Ahead of Tillerson Visit 0:41 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/882574403618\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \nBefore his trip, Tillerson began laying the groundwork to help strengthen the relationship between Mexico and the U.S. \nDuring his first week on the job, he calledand later met with Mexican Foreign Secretary Luis Videgaray in Washington, D.C. \nDuring his confirmation hearing, Tillerson called Mexico \"a long-standing neighbor and friend of this country.\" \nBut far more will need to be done when both he and Kelly meet with top Mexican officials on Thursday, foreign policy experts said. \nLast month, a planned trip by Nieto to the White House was cancelled in the wake of a fiery spat over which nation will pay for a border wall between the two countries. \nTrump and Nieto later spoke by phone after the cancellation calling the conversation \"constructive and productive\" Dear Sean, tell that to your boss. He's the one damaging our relation with his lies and hate. Tell him that México stands strong and proud. https://t.co/AP1p0Vtd43 — Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) February 22, 2017 \nThough Mexican leaders continue to say they will not pay for the wall, the war of words between the heads of state has largely subsided for now. Mexican leaders say Trump pledged he would stop speaking publicly about the barrier at the southern border and walked back a proposal to add a 20 percent tax to Mexican products imported into the U.S. \nBut the political detente has not settled passions in either country. \nWidespread anti-Trump protests were held in 18 cities across Mexico earlier this month. Cities in the U.S. held a \"Day Without Immigrants\" protests to showcase the importance of immigrants in addition to the massive protests that took place the day after Trump's inauguration. \nRelated: Here's What You Need to Know About the new DHS Illegal Immigration Crackdown \nThe Tillerson and Kelly visit also coincides with the Trump administration's newly unveiled immigration policies aimed at ramping up the deportation of undocumented immigrants. Part of the policy involves sending those who enter the country illegally through the southern border back to Mexico, even if they aren't from that country. \nAdministration officials, however, have said the Tillerson trip will be focused on the areas where the two countries can find agreement. Paying for the wall is just one aspect of the vast range of issues facing the two countries. \nAt the G-20 economic summit, however, Videgaray did not shy away from what is at stake in the upcoming negotiations. \n\"This is a moment of definition: The decisions we make in the coming months will determine how Mexico and the United States coexist for the next decades,\" he said last week at the summit in Germany.
