Ronald Coyne,18, a first-year law student at Pembroke College, was dressed in a bow tie and tails when he taunted the rough sleeper. There has also been calls for him to work 200 hours in a homeless shelter. Commenting on the petition, Anne Baynham from Newent, said: 'He needs to learn that you can't treat people this way and then just go about your privileged life with no consequences.' Others have suggested he must face some sort of punishment and that he 'does not deserve the privilege of education at the Cambridge University'. It is believed the shocking Snapchat video was filmed in the early hours of Thursday 2 February and was seen by hundreds of students. In the film the student struggles to light the note while the camera pans to the homeless person. The Cambridge University Conservative Association named the student as Ronald Coyne, its communications officer, and said it has now expelled him from the group. The video shows a homeless man (pictured) standing in Bridge Street in Cambridge city centre clutching what appears to be a sleeping bag Ronald Coyne, wearing a white bow tie and tails, appears to attempt to burn a £20 note in front of the homeless man RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:26:02.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
