'But the minute the Olympics were over, the whole thing disintegrated.' The Olympics - and to a lesser extent the 2014 World Cup - showcased the reality of Rio, a city romanticized for its sprawling beaches, annual Carnival celebration, and sensual lifestyle. It also exposed the city's crime, environmental contamination, and corruption. Brazil won gold in the men's football final at Rio 2016, but since then the Maracana has been vandalised Four of the new arenas in the main Olympic Park have failed to find private-sector management Some building projects connected to the Olympics and World Cup have been tied to a probe which has led to the jailing of dozens of politicians and businessmen for receiving kickbacks in Brazil's largest corruption scandal. Three politicians who were instrumental in landing and organizing the Olympics - former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, former Rio governor Sergio Cabral, and former Rio Mayor Eduardo - have been under investigation. Cabral, an early promoter of the Olympics and World Cup, has been jailed on corruption charges. 'The Olympics gave people a better sense of the difficulties Brazil faces,' Stuenkel said. 'Maybe not a better or worse image, but more rounded.' Sidney Levy, the chief executive officer of the Rio organizing committee, tried to run the games with only private money, and almost succeeded. His £2.4billion operating budget - the budget for running the games, not building the infrastructure - was frugal by Olympic standards. At the last minute, he had to ask for a 250-million-real bailout - £64m - from the city of Rio and the federal government to run the Paralympics. Eventually, he got only 100 million reals (£24m), and the shortfall has left organisers owing creditors millions. The Olympic Aquatics Centre is a deserted shell of its former self where American great Michael Phelps reigned supreme Meanwhile the outdoor warm-up pool which was covered during the games, is filled with muddy, stagnant water Today, Levy says he's nearly a forgotten man. 'I could call the president of the country, and the call was taken,' Levy said. 'But try it today. I could call the IOC and everybody. But now people have other things to handle. We are no longer a priority.' Levy said organisers probably lost about £160m in income during the run-up to the games as sponsors backed out of expensive deals as the recession kicked in. Levy said he has not asked the IOC to help pay debts, but acknowledged the Olympic body came up with millions in advance money several times during the run-up to the games. 'The whole thing was too painful,' Levy told The Associated Press. 'We never really enjoyed the games, themselves; 2016 was just extremely hard. It's like we were climbing Everest, and ice is falling on your lips, and you are not seeing.' The Olympic Tennis Centre was used earlier this month for a one-day beach volleyball tournament Despite the city owning endless sand and beaches the decision was to use the Olympic Tennis Centre The Olympic Park is a ghost town; sleek sports arenas without events, deserted before they were even broken in, and well-tended flower gardens, free from pedestrian wear-and-tear. 'The arenas are beautiful,' Wagner Tolvai said, walking inside the park with his girlfriend Patricia Silva. 'But it's all abandoned, everything has stopped. Nobody is here.' He likened the 2.5 billion real (£640m) park to a new shopping mall 'without stores, or customers.' The park is only open on weekends, and there's not much to do but walk, pedal a bike, or look for shade. Four permanent arenas are being run by the federal government. Among them is the Olympic tennis centre, which was used earlier this month for a one-day beach volleyball tournament. This in a city with endless sand and beaches. Two temporary venues for swimming and handball have yet to be dismantled. The exterior of the swimming venue is falling apart and many translucent tapestries that covered the outside of the building are frayed or falling to the ground. This outside shot of the temporary Olympic Aquatics Centre shows it's already crumbling The warm-up pool, which was covered during the games, is filled with muddy, stagnant water. Away from the park, the famous Maracana stadium has drawn the most attention. It was renovated for the 2014 World Cup at a cost of about £400m. It was largely abandoned after the Olympics and Paralympics, and then hit by vandals who ripped out thousands of seats and stole televisions. 'The Maracana is the biggest symbol of the way the games were managed,' said Mauricio Santoro, a political scientist at Rio de Janeiro State University. 'The vast majority of people in Rio will never go to the golf course, or the Olympic venues. But the Maracana is different. It's the jewel of the crown.' Up the road from the Olympic Park, the £800m Athletes Village - it housed about 10,000 athletes - is fenced off and empty. The developer says it has sold only 260 of the 3,604 apartments - about seven per cent. Rio's Globo newspaper reported that new Rio Mayor Marcelo Crivella is arranging low-cost loans for public employees to buy the units.
