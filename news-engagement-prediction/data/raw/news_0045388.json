Trump’s citation of a seemingly-nonexistent terror attack became subject to mockery over the weekend, and the Swedish Embassy demanded an explanation from the government earlier today. \nNow that Trump has confirmed that his remarks were derived from a Fox News report , the Swedish Embassy has announced that they will be having a word with the Trump administration about their immigration policies: We look forward to informing the US administration about Swedish immigration and integration policies. https://t.co/x5G3euOWRh \n— Embassy of Sweden US (@SwedeninUSA) February 19, 2017 \n[Image via wikimedia] ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T02:57:15.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
