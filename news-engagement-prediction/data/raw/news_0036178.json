Her last nomination in 2012 was for “Albert Knobbs.” \nWikimedia Commons \nRipley herself got a best actress nomination for “Alien” but didn’t win. She also got a best actress nomination for “Gorillas in the Mist: The Story of Dian Fossey” and a best supporting actress nod for \"Working Girl.\" Weaver has said that awards shows give sci-fi films \"no respect.\" \nAnnette Bening Mike Windle/Getty Images for SeriousFun Children's Network \nThree nominations, yet she always gets beat by another powerful performance. Her latest nomination was in 2011 for \"The Kids Are Alright.\" She lost to Natalie Portman for her performance in \"Black Swan.\" In 2017, she was snubbed with no nomination for her acclaimed work in \"20th Century Women.\" Tom Cruise Anthony Harvey/Getty Images \nLove him or hate him, Tom Cruise has actually delivered some Oscar-worthy performances. His ambitious work in Paul Thomas Anderson's \"Magnolia\" got him a best supporting actor nomination in 2000, but he lost to Michael Caine for his work in \"The Cider House Rules.\" Joaquin Phoenix Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images \nIn 2006, Joaquin Phoenix didn't win best actor for his protrayl of Johnny Cash in \"Walk the Line.\" He lost to the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman for his portaryl of Truman Captoe in \"Capote. \" The two actors would later work together in 2012's \"The Master.\" Phoenix's role in that movie lost to the impossible-to-beat Daniel Day-Lewis for \"Lincoln.\" Roger Deakins Ian Gavan/Getty Images \nThe master cinematographer has 13 nominations, but sadly, no wins yet. Some of his nominated work includes \"Skyfall,\" \"No Country for Old Men,\" \"Fargo,\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" Hello, Academy! Are you there? Give this man an Oscar already. Viola Davis Carlo Allegri/Reuters \nThe Emmy Award-winning actress isn't an Oscar-winning actress just yet. Since 2009, she's gotten three nominations: first for \"Doubt,\" then \"The Help,\" and in 2017 for \"Fences.\" Will Smith Getty Images \nWith two nominations, Smith still hasn't gotten a win. He was a frontrunner for best actor in 2002 for his role in \"Ali,\" but lost to Denzel Washington for his role in \"Training Day.\" Had Smith won, he would have become the second black actor to win in the best actor category, but Washington took that title. (The first was Sidney Portier in 1964 .) Smith's other nomination was for \"The Pursuit of Happyness\" in 2007. Paul Thomas Anderson \n\"Always a bridesmaid, never the bride\" kind of applies to Paul Thomas Anderson. With six nominations and even with \"There Will be Blood\" being a classic, he somehow still hasn't managed to win a little gold guy. Gary Oldman \nThis charming Brit has no Oscars, and only one nomination, which was for best supporting actor in \"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\" in 2012. Amy Adams Ari Perilstein/Getty Images for FIJI Water \nAmy Adams is the new Leonardo DiCaprio when it comes to deserving an Oscar. His win for \"The Revenant\" gives us high hopes for her future with the Academy. Adams has six nominations and a snub for her incredible performance in 2016's \"Arrival,\" but she'll be back for the win one day soon. Ralph Fiennes GettyImages / Kevin Winter \nNot even Vodlemort could summon himself an Oscar. Fiennes has two nominations, and was arguably robbed in 1994 when he lost best supporting actor for his role in \"Schindler's List\" to Tommy Lee Jones, who won for \"The Fugitive.\" Ed Harris Getty Images \nThe Man in Black/iconic character actor has gotten four nominations throughout his impressive career, but no wins. His last nomination was for best supporting actor 13 years ago for \"The Hours.\" He lost to Chris Cooper for his role in \"Adaptation.\" Bradley Cooper Getty Images / Jason Merritt \nWith four nominations since 2013, Cooper is already an Oscar nomination machine. He was a frontrunner for his role in \"American Snpier\" in 2015, but lost to Eddie Redmayne for \"The Theory of Everything.\" Three of Cooper's nominations are for acting. His fourth would have been a best picture statue, since he was a producer on \"American Sniper.\" \"Birdman\" won that honor instead. Mark Wahlberg Adam Berry/dapd \nOnly one of Wahlerg's two nominations is for acting. In 2007 he got his first Oscar nomination ever for his supporting role in \"The Departed,\" and in 2011 he was nominated for best picture as a producer on \"The Fighter.\" Naomi Watts \nShe cuts it close every year, but still hasn't won. Her two nominations to date were for \"21 Grams\" in 2004 and \"The Impossible\" in 2015. Michelle Williams \nSince the ending of \"Dawson's Creek,\" Michelle Williams has proved she's much more than just another teen-soap star. Since 2006, she's gotten four nominations, including one in 2017 for her supporting role in \"Manchester by the Sea.\" Kathleen Kennedy Getty Images \nThe longtime Steven Spielberg collaborator has never won an Oscar for producing since none of her movies has gotten a best picture win despite eight nominations over the course of 30-plus years, including for \"E.T.,\" \"The Sixth Sense,\" \"War Horse,\" and \"Lincoln.\" Ridley Scott Stuart Wilson/Getty Images \nThe stylish director has been making feature films since the late '70s, but has only been nominated four times with zero wins. His last nomination was in 2016, when \"The Martian\" was nominated for best picture. His nominations for best director were for \"Thelma & Louise,\" \"Gladiator,\" and \"Black Hawk Down.\" David Lynch Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images \nWith four nominations, there's still no win for the visionary director. He's been nominated in the best director category for \"The Elephant Man,\" \"Blue Velvet,\" and \"Mullholland Drive.\" He also got a best adapted screenplay nomination for \"The Elephant Man,\" but lost to \"Ordinary People.\" Liam Neeson Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images \nYou're probably thinking, \"Wait, he didn't win for 'Schindler's List'?\" He didn't, because America's dad Tom Hanks got the best actor win that year for \"Forrest Gump.\" David Fincher Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty \nThe \"Fight Club\" director has a distinct style and gets recognized at awards shows more and more these days, but has only two Oscar nominations: best director for \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button\" and \"The Social Network.\" Fincher's distinct style — and impressive line of work including \"Zodiac,\" \"Se7en,\" and \"Gone Girl\" — is bound to get a win one day. Jessica Chastain Alberto E. Rodriguez / Getty Images \nThe actress was a frontrunner to win for her role in \"Zero Dark Thirty\" in 2013, but lost to Jennifer Lawrence for her role in \"Silver Linings Playbook.\" Her other nomination was in 2012 for her supporting role in \"The Help.\" She lost that one to her costar Octavia Spencer. Edward Norton AP Images \nSurprisingly, the Method actor doesn't have an Oscar, despite three nominations for \"Primal Fear,\" \"American History X,\" and \"Birdman.\" Helena Bonham Carter Getty Images / Jason Merritt \nShe has two nominations under her belt, but no wins. Her most recent nomination was for her supporting role in \"The King's Speech\" in 2011. Her first nomination was in 1998 for her lead role in \"The Wings of the Dove.\" Brad Pitt Emmanuel Wong/Getty Images \nTechnically this is cheating. Brad Pitt does have an Oscar: He was a producer on \"12 Years a Slave,\" which won best picture in 2014. But he hasn't won an Oscar for acting. He got acting nominations for his roles in \"12 Monkeys,\" \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\" and \"Moneyball.\" This seems like a crime.
