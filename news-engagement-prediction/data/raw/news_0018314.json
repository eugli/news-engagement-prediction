No amount of money would make him do that,\" she said. \nPolice allege Mr Geraghty, from Clovelly, and Mr Willcox, a Randwick electrician, travelled to St George Basin last week to meet Mr Wren, a caretaker of a Maritime Union training facility in the coastal town. \nIt's alleged the three were going to meet the Elakha out at sea. However, they were arrested hours after HMAS Bathurst boarded the yacht in a midnight raid. \nMr Geraghty was a P.E. teacher at Randwick Boys' High in the late 1990s. \nYahay Magdalawi, 32, who also goes by the name John Majdalawi and runs a tiling business in Punchbowl, was also arrested on Friday. \nThe men, many of whom have known each other for decades, have been charged with conspiracy to import a border controlled drug which carries a maximum life sentence. \nThe investigation started with a tip-off from New Zealand authorities, who had been watching the Elakha for four years. \nJustice Minister Michael Keenan said the intercept would put a huge dent in cocaine supply but several busts in the last two months show that Australia is a \"honey pot\" for global syndicates. \nOne kilogram of cocaine sells for $26,000 in America or $240,000 in Australia due to the higher street price. \nAustralian Federal Police acting deputy commissioner Neil Gaughan said the arrests were \"a testament to the officers' drive and determination\".
