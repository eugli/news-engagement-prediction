We have summoned a meeting among all the stakeholders including the herdsmen for Friday. \n“We have appealed to our people to maintain peace and thank God, so far, there is no lost of lives of human and cows. \n“Our people are suspicious of the herdsmen because of the kind of arms some of them are carrying: that is why they are resisting them. \n“We are ensuring that the farmers, hunters and the herdsmen live together in peace because we are all one. But we must live and operate within the law of the land.” \nThe Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti state Command, Alberto Adeyemi, said he was to receive such briefing from the Area Commander and the Divisional Police Officer. \nHe said officers of the command our on ground to handle any emergencies adding that police hot lines had been circulated among residents in the town. \nAdeyemi added that there was nothing to indicate tension in the town as the Police were alive to their responsibilities. adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:56:55.139+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
