Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA family have revealed their terror when a a rough sleeper asked them for a cigarette and then downed pills 'like he was eating M&Ms' in front of them in a bid to kill himself. \nHusband and wife Emma and Chris Seasman as well as daughter Eavan, 17, had been walking together when a homeless man asked for a cigarette. They told him they had none and he said he wanted to have 'one last smoke before I die.' \nThe man then took an overdose, swallowing handfuls of pills as he tried to take his own life. \nThe couple called an ambulance and stayed with him to keep him awake as they desperately tried to save his life - despite him urging them to leave him as he said 'it would be better to die.' \nEmma, 38, shared the experience on Facebook to raise awareness of the homelessness issue facing the city of Liverpool - and why it’s so important to look out for other people. \nShe wrote: “Today Chris said hello to a bloke who asked for a cigarette . We said sorry mate none of us smoke. I asked him if he wanted some change, and he said ‘no, I want one last smoke before I die’.

I knew enough about overdoses to know I had to try and keep him awake.\" \n“While waiting for the ambulance Eavan and I listened to him talk about his life as he grew drowsy trying to lay down to sleep. He comes from Latvia and his sister is a millionaire but she doesn’t like him and won't help.” \nShe added: “He was wearing Everton tracksuit bottoms, even though he prefers German football. He has stunningly blue eyes that stood out more as his pupils became pinholes. He smiled and laughed although he’d just OD’d to the max. \n“He apologised and asked ‘please can you leave me to die, it would be better’. \n“If we had walked in a different direction, or if Chris hadn’t said hello to a bloke who asked for a cigarette, maybe he would have just looked like a drunk homeless man asleep in a doorway.\" Read More Woman marries man she met when he was a tramp searching her bins for food 40 years ago \nEmma said she asked the man about himself who told her he was 34 and gave his name. But she didn't want to reveal it and gave it as C . \nShe added: \"Every person on the street has a life and a history. I hope C gets the help he needs so he can live another 34 years at least.” Parr Street, Liverpool (Photo: Google Street View) \nEmma told the Liverpool Echo she thinks it’s important to say hello when people are living on the streets. \nShe said: “I’d say just say hello or give eye contact and smile rather than blank people. You don’t have to give change to everyone as it’s impossible but at least acknowledge someone as a bare minimum. I stopped because he asked a question so it’s only polite to respond.” \nHer Facebook post has been shared dozens of times and racked up a lot of comments. \nOne Facebook user commented: “Breaks my heart Emma.” \nAnother added: “So sad but well said to many people brush them off as scum when you take the time there is some really good guys on our streets.” \nEmma said she tried to find out what condition the man was in today, but couldn’t for patient confidentiality reasons. \nAnyone looking to help out a homeless sleeper can visit the Whitechapel Centre website for more information.
