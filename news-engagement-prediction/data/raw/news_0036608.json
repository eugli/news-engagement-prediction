In January, he plead no contest to a 2016 drunken driving arrest and was sentenced to 18 months of probation. \nTherefore, as Pro Football Talk notes , he might be subject to a two-game suspension, given the NFLâ€™s newest policies. \nWhile it remains to be seen what he can do on the football field, teams will also have to consider that when they evaluate the former star. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
