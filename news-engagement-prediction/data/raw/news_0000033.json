Young girls who dream of playing football for Carlton or Collingwood now know it can become reality. Hope is a wonderful thing. \nBut it's important that people reign in their expectations in the first few years of the competition. \nLast year's exhibition match between Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs surprised fans with its pace, ferocity and exciting play. But this was essentially an all-star game. \nIt created hype around the competition that it craved and needed. It made Moana Hope and Daisy Pearce into household names. But it also created a high benchmark. \nFor decades, the men's game has had clear development pathways to help boys progress to senior football — the level of coaching and support at Under 18 level is immense. \nWomen have not had those luxuries. Some local clubs don't even have female-friendly change rooms. \nThere are code hoppers — women who played basketball, soccer, even an Olympic javelin thrower — who are athletes but not necessarily football players. \nThe pool of talent is not as deep once it is spread across eight teams. That was one reason why the AFL limited the number of teams in this first phase. \nThe competition needs time to develop, to find its feet and to grow the talent from the ground up. \nHopefully, what we see in five or ten years will be lightyears ahead of what we see on Friday night. That's no slight on the women who have the chance to make history this weekend. \nIt's the hope that the next generation — the girls who are 10,12 and 13-years-old — will have grown up in those elite pathways that were until now only available for boys, and their skills will be so much better.

Because this will be footy in its purest sense. \nIt will be played with joy, passion and without pressure of expectation or history. It will (hopefully) be free-flowing and not bogged down by tactics, zones and the defensive press. \nYou may have noticed the players speak honestly, openly and without 'one week at at time' cliches. Perhaps that will change as it becomes more professional, but until then it should be embraced. \nWe tend to dream about the good old days of suburban grounds, of leaning over the fence and standing behind the goals. Here's your chance to go along to Princes Park and Whitten Oval, head out to the huddle at quarter-time and kick the footy when the siren sounds.

Be patient with what you see because there's still a long way to go. \nBut stand in the outer, cheer on the trailblazers and support the next generation. Get excited. \nThat's the only way women's footy will reach its full potential, and you might just enjoy yourself in the process.
