To have guys at the U-19 level, who are playing first-class cricket doesn’t happen very often, so those two are definitely players to watch. Virat Kohli captained India to the Under 19 World Cup in 2009. Source: Getty Images \n“We see Michael Hill as someone with real talent. Josh Hazlewood is a fast bowler with a great future. He’s 6’5” now and will probably grow to 6’7”. He also has the next U-19 World Cup ahead of him. We see him as a future Australian player.” \nThree of the four names he mentioned played Test cricket for Australia. Two of them, Smith and Hazlewood, are central to their chances of success in India. \nAnd it’s a measure of how far Smith has come in that time that he now averages over 60 in Tests, after starting off as a leggie who batted at No. 8. \nAt first glance, Kohli and Smith couldn’t be more dissimilar. One struts around like the cock of the walk, even though he’s become the epitome of statesmanship in his media interactions. The other fades into the background when he doesn’t have bat in hand. \nOne is with his childhood sweetheart. The other dates a Bollywood actress, half a century after Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, India’s first great Test captain, married Sharmila Tagore. \nBut if you dig a little deeper, you’ll find commonalities too. \nSmith certainly wasn’t the first cab off the rank in age-group cricket, not as a batsman anyway. Kohli’s progress, for all his undoubted talent, was made difficult by the hotbed of corruption that is Delhi cricket, where administrators have been known to make rogue Nigerian oil ministers look like models of probity. \nLive stream India v Australia Test Series LIVE on FOX SPORTS.

Picture: Phil Hillyard Source: News Corp Australia \nSmith comes from working-class Western Sydney. Kohli’s roots are in West Delhi, home to thousands of families that fled what is now Pakistan when the subcontinent was partitioned. You tend to scrap for everything there, including parking space. \nSo chiselled, groomed and well spoken is Kolhi now that many mistakenly assume he grew up with a silver spoon alongside the cricket bat. That wasn’t the case. \nOne of the most poignant pictures on an Instagram page otherwise devoted to selfies, gym workouts and the like is of young Virat with his father, who passed away when he was 18. Kohli senior is still wearing a turquoise helmet, having just come home from work. Delhi’s rich usually have three or four cars. They don’t potter around on two-wheelers, unless they’re of the 500 or 1000cc variety. \nBoth also took their time to get used to the rhythms of Test cricket. Kohli made 76 in five innings in his first series. Smith’s average didn’t cross 40 till his 20th Test. Kohli’s hovered around that mark till he toured Australia in 2014, and feasted to the tune of 692 runs in four Tests. \nSmith attributes a technical change he made at the WACA during the 2013-14 Ashes for the run glut that followed. Kohli says it was his 75 at that very venue in January 2012 that made him feel like he belonged at this level. He scored his first hundred in the next Test, at the Adelaide Oval. \nEach of them has also shown the quality that Jennings identified so well in Kohli all those years ago. Some quail when confronted by a challenge. These two stare it down and then demolish it. \nSmith averages 73.73 in 20 Tests as captain. Kohli’s numbers are 67.22 from 23 matches. Both have scored nine hundreds while leading the side. Smith on new look Test side 0:32 \nOn the eve of the Test, I asked Kohli about Smith and coping with the demands of leadership. “Captaincy does not allow you to be complacent at any stage, especially with the bat, if that is your only discipline in the game,” he answered. \n“You tend to focus a lot more in certain situations, which you might or might not without the extra responsibility on your shoulders. \n“Captaincy requires you to be on point throughout the game. That’s one thing which has worked well for me, and I think Steve Smith as well. He has been performing consistently with the bat and as captain. The responsibility has urged him to focus a bit more in certain situations and push that much extra for his team. That has shown in his performances. He is the No. 1 Test player in the world and there’s a reason for that. \n“I can’t pinpoint any similarities in our career. I have seen him at the [Australian] academy. He was never a dominant batsman. It’s a remarkable achievement for someone starting his career as a leg-spinner.” \nOn Thursday morning, as the two walk out for the toss, any mutual admiration will be left behind in the dressing room. \nWhich is what you’d expect from an Australian, and an ‘almost Australian’. \nDileep Premachandran is editor-in-chief of Wisden India .
