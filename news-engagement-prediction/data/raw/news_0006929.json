OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) The Golden State Warriors have waived center Anderson Varejao to clear a roster spot on the NBA's top team as it deals with depth issues and injuries.\nGolden State announced the move Friday, a day after the Brazilian big man played eight-plus minutes in a road win at the Clippers. The Warriors are gearing up for the return of David West from a nondisplaced fracture of his left thumb sustained Jan. 18 against Oklahoma City. Starting center Zaza Pachulia is sidelined until at least next week with a strained rotator cuff in his right shoulder.\nVarejao averaged 1.3 points and 1.9 rebounds in 6.6 minutes per game for Golden State, playing 14 games with one start.\nThe Warriors (43-7) play again Saturday night at Sacramento.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/"], "published": "2017-02-03T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:10:42.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
