After Schlapp said that Democrats and Trump’s critics should consider it the “right thing” for him to accept Flynn’s resignations, Navarro hit back, noting that Trump’s aides have said different things on TV and that “it’s very hard to follow.” \nFollowing host Brooke Baldwin playing a clip from the White House press briefing where press secretary Sean Spicer said the Trump sdministration has been tough on Russia , Navarro said there was no universe in which this was true and began highlighting some “troublesome Russia-Trump ties.” \nAt that point, Schlapp jumped in, asking Baldwin if he could have some time. Schlapp then went on to claim that Trump is intent on trying to thaw relations with Russia and Vladimir Putin. This would lead into a tense back-and-forth between Navarro and Schlapp, with the latter actually asking Baldwin at one point to “help me out here” so he could have some uninterrupted airtime. \nAs Navarro continued to go on, claiming Trump has given “moral equivalency” to Russia, Schlapp told her to stop. \n“Don’t tell me to stop,” Navarro angrily responded back. “If you want to tell the people in your house to stop, go for it.” \nShe continued, “You’re talking to the wrong girl, Matt. You’re talking to the wrong girl. You can say stop to somebody else, you’re not going to stop me, baby!” \nWatch the entire segment above, via CNN. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:43:08.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
