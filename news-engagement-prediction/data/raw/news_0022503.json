The police said in a statement on Friday that they have arrested a 37-year-old man for outrage of modesty and that he is currently assisting with investigations. “The Police are aware of allegations that some inappropriate comments were made by a female Police officer, when attending to a complaint relating to an alleged molest. The Police are looking into the matter.” Earlier this week, Facebook user Amanda Lai posted about the alleged incident , saying that one of her colleagues, T, was molested while having a Chinese New Year office dinner at Mouth Restaurant at Cross Street in Chinatown. T and another colleague, R, went to the restroom and was walking back to the restaurant when two men blocked the corridor, said Lai, who didn’t attend the dinner. The men said they were from Portugal and one of them purportedly harassed T and asked her to “take her shirt off and show him her boobs”, according to Lai. Despite T saying “No” repeatedly, “the man moved towards her, picked her up off the floor and molested her”, Lai said. After R screamed, the alleged molester put T down, Lai added. T’s other colleagues confronted the two men and tried to prevent them from leaving, according to Lai. A tussle ensued and the alleged molester “charged forward and headbutted” a male colleague, Lai claimed. The following day, T filed a police report about the incident. Lai said that a police officer allegedly asked T, “Are you sure you want to do this? If this goes to court, you’ll need to testify” and added, “Are you sure they weren’t just trying to be friendly? You know, ang moh culture is different from ours.” Reblog ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T01:17:10.644+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
