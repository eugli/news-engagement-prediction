It is as much her strength as it is her Achilles heel. Her recklessness can lead to a remarkable mixture of sonic stylings, blending rap, house, R&B, and whatever else draws her attention, but it can also get her suspended from Twitter . A few months before she released her breakout hit “ 212 ” in 2011, she got a boost when another song called “ Runnin’ ” featuring Canadian producer Lunice made the rounds online. Now, the duo’s latest collaboration, “Crown,” celebrates Banks signing a new record deal and getting reinstated on Twitter. But the song is a prime example of what can happen when this artist’s unpredictability misses the mark. \n“Crown” isn’t “Runnin’,” which was smooth, subtle, and boasted some of her most vivid writing Instead, the track is marred by beat shifts often sound more like interruptions than change-ups, with Banks awkwardly oscillating between vicious raps and busts of song. Each new part sounds out of tune with what came before, both in key and in function. The song is redeemed by her flow, which can navigate the nooks and crannies in any production. She slips nimbly between synth notes with a breathless cadence, unabated and in control. Being a fan of Azealia Banks is a compromise to accept antics on the condition of quality music. Because of this, a song that is mostly a celebratory trifle ends up coming off as a bit of a letdown, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:20:57.718+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
