asylum-seekers who cross the Mediterranean illegally could be sent back to transit countries such as Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria while their cases are considered.\nThe proposals come as a leaked German government paper warned that as many as 5.9m people could seek to enter the EU from countries around the Mediterranean.\nThey would open the way for migrants to be held in internment camps in North Africa while their asylum applications are processed.\nBut they are likely to prove controversial amid warnings that asylum-seekers’ safety cannot be guaranteed in countries suffering from their own internal conflicts such as Libya.\nEU member states are currently debating reforms to the bloc’s current asylum system so it can cope with a repeat of the 2015 refugee crisis.\nA policy document put forward by Germany calls for a “crisis mechanism” that would “only spring into action in the event of a mass influx”.\nFrance denied reports that French officials also worked on the paper.\nWatch

accepting genuine refugees.\nWhile the policy document does not name specific countries it is clearly aimed at the North African countries from which migrants attempt to cross the Mediterranean.\nFollowing the deal with Turkey the Mediterranean became the main route to Europe.\nAttempts to broker Turkey-style deals with these countries have so far faltered over concerns over human rights.\nUnder the proposals, the EU would drop its human rights safeguards so asylum-seekers can be deported to the countries\nUnder current EU rules, migrants can only be deported to third countries that are considered safe according to a set of strict criteria.\nThe proposal calls for the EU to permit deportations to countries which agree not to send asylum-seekers back to the countries they fled from in the first place, and provide guarantees of “safe and humane living conditions”.\nWatch | Violent protests erupt in Paris against alleged police rape 00:55 T hese conditions need not exist throughout the country, so long as they are available in specific locations, the document notes.\nThis appears to open the way for North African internment camps, a proposal that has previously been put forward by Germany.\n\"This is not about building a 'fortress Europe'. It is about combating illegal immigration, which has already cost the lives of thousands, and about replacing it by a regulated system of legal admissions, combined with humane living conditions, assured by the EU in third countries,” the policy document says.\nBut the proposals are likely to prove controversial, particularly if they are extended to Libya, the main transit country for Mediterreanean crossings, which is still in the grip of civil war and battling Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil).\n“Libya is not Turkey,” Kate Kuschminder, a research fellow at the European University Institute wrote for The Conversation website last week.\nThe proposals come as Germany’s Bild newspaper published a leaked government report warning that as many as 5.9m asylum-seekers may be preparing to travel to the EU from neighbouring countries.\nWhile Turkey has the highest number, with 2.9m, Libya is second with 1.2m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:31:13.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
