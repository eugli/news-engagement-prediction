Waytha Moorthy was reported to have asked the US government to step in and take action against Dr Zakir, whom he accused of promoting terrorism. \nDr Asri said it was not the first time that Hindraf had created racial controversy and warned the public to be more careful of such accusations. \nHe also said that Dr Zakir was known for playing with words. \nIf people disagreed with what he was talking about, they should counter him with intellectual and academic arguments, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:46:10.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
