The North East coast, including Newcastle, will see temperatures of 3C with rain and sleet. This evening, some parts of the UK will be between -3C and -4C. Friday will also be cold, with widespread frost overnight into Saturday. There may be snow on Sunday, with higher ground seeing as much as 6cm (2.4in). The Met Office said the colder spell was due to easterly winds from Scandinavia. 'It's going to be on higher ground that we see any of the showers turn into show,' Ms Sillitoe added. Age UK said cold weather can have a 'devastating impact' on the health of older people, causing increased blood pressure and raising the risk of chest infections. A farm building in Teesdale, County Durham, was surrounded by snow after wintry showers fell over higher ground A motorist carefully drives along a snow lined road in Teesdale this week as temperatures dropped below freezing again Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: 'The cold weather can be really challenging for older people, particularly those who are more vulnerable because of pre-existing health conditions or who are living in housing that is difficult and expensive to heat. 'It can also be an especially lonely time, if older people feel it is too cold to go out and about. With the weather set to take a turn for the worse, we are urging people to check our advice to make sure they are doing everything they can to protect themselves against the cold weather. 'We'd also urge people to keep an eye on their older family members, friends or neighbours when the weather is particularly bad. Picking up some shopping for them or just popping in to check they're okay and having a friendly chat can be a real help at this time of year.' Monday of last week was the coldest night of the year so far, with -10.1C recorded in Braemar, Aberdeenshire. The coldest UK temperature of 2016 was -12.4C at Kinbrace, while in 2015 it was -13.7C at Loch Glascarnoch. 'Willy-willy' hits chilly hilly: Rare 100ft tall SNOWNADO is spotted on Scottish mountain This is the moment a rare 'snownado' touched down on a mountain in the Scottish Highlands, whirling snow and ice in a circle at least 100ft off the ground. Skiers and walkers were dwarfed on Cairngorm Mountain near Aviemore by the stunning spiralling pillar of snow – also known as a 'willy willy' - which disappeared as quickly as it appeared. The phenomenon – spotted by Lynn Godfrey on Monday of last week - typically forms when a cold air mass passes over a warmer surface, heated by sunlight. Wind shear then causes the rising air to spin. more videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:49:42.018+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
