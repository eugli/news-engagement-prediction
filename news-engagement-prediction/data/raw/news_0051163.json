It was the first time in the 122-year history of their union that its membership had walked off the job.\nThe new law would bring to an end the teachers' work-to-rule campaign, which began Dec. 5. It also imposes a four-year contract that contains a three per cent salary increase and incorporates many of the elements included in the first two tentative agreements rejected by union members.\nThe Liberal government adopted one minor amendment during proceedings that will see an arbitrator used if a dispute arises between members of a council being created to come up with recommendations to improve working conditions in the classroom.\nPart of the last deal rejected by the union, the provision would have allowed the arbitrator to rule on issues worth up to $250,000 a year. Liberal house leader Michel Samson said the government was doubling the amount to $500,000 and that any member of the 14-member council would now be allowed to trigger the arbitration process.\nUnder questioning in the legislature, Premier Stephen McNeil also revealed the government saved about $3.4 million in the one-day labour disruption. He said the money would be used for student grants across the province.\nMcNeil was asked by Baillie whether the province was setting aside funds for a court challenge the union has vowed to launch.\n\"By his reckless actions the premier has committed the taxpayers of Nova Scotia to years of legal challenges and millions of dollars in legal costs,\" Baillie said.\nHe pointed out that prior challenges in British Columbia and Ontario had resulted in successful lawsuits.\nHowever, McNeil expressed confidence the bill would withstand a legal challenge by the union.\n\"We had three different agreements with two different executives of the teachers' union,\" he said. \"Each and every time we went to the table...we changed the agreement providing more support...\n\"I think even the lawyer representing the teachers' union said this piece of legislation will stand the test.\"\nMcNeil has said that after the legislation is passed the government will focus on the committee for classroom improvement, which will get $20 million over two years to spend on classroom improvements.\nThe union has said the council's composition of four government representatives, one union co-chair and nine classroom teachers selected by school board superintendents doesn't give the union enough say.\nIn Pictures: Striking teachers protest outside N.S. legislature \nRelated Stories N.S. teachers to hold one-day strike Friday to protest imposed contract N.S. schools under-staffed and stressed, teachers say as they resist contract N.S. premier on striking teachers: 'The frustration here is real'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:01:08.669+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
