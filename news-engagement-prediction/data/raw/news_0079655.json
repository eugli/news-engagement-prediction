It's all fun.\" \n\"Zooming\" is Dyson's signature move after a steal in which he revs the handles on a fictitious motorcycle. \nPerez said on Sunday that he'll be ready. \n\"That's his game,\" Perez said. \"He's going to try to steal second base. I'm going to try to do my job. We'll see what happens tomorrow. \n\"Yeah, it'll be fun, but not because it's Dyson. And it's not always about the catcher. The pitcher does his job, the catcher does his job, you have the opportunity to throw the guy out.\" \nFirst, Dyson must get on base. \n\"That's the first thing,\" Perez said, smiling. \nActually, Dyson is simply looking forward to seeing his former teammates. \n\"It'll be just going out there and shaking the guys' hands,\" Dyson said. \"Haven't seen some of them in a long time. I've got friendships with those guys. Together a long time.\" has covered the Royals since 1991, and for MLB.com since 2015. Follow him on Twitter @FlannyMLB .
