A post shared by Jessa Seewald (@jessaseewald) on Dec 21, 2015 at 8:30am PST \nIn fact, the tears start well before the big day when Jinger tries on her dress for the final time. \n\"You and I have been super close ever since you were born,\" Jessa Seewald says through tears. \n\"I was probably not the best influence on you when we were really young. Even though you're younger than me, I've always thought of you as one of my greatest role models.\" \nNeedless to say, Jinger starts crying too. \n\"Give us a couple months, and then come visit us,\" she says back to her sis. \nThen, on the night before the big day, Jessa decides to give a little speech that kind of comes off the wrong way. \n\"I don't think we fully calculated all the ramifications of how it was going to play out that you were going to take her 12 hours away from us,\" the mother of two says to Jeremy. \nWe don’t think “ramifications” was necessarily the right word, but we understand what she’s saying! \n\"I think it's starting to sink in more and more how much we're going to miss Jinger [when she] moves away. We love you both, and we're really excited for what God has in your future.\" \nThankfully Jinger doesn’t seem to be offended and the wedding goes on the next day without a hitch! \nEven their first kiss, which goes down at the altar, is pretty perfect. \n\"It was incredible,\" Jeremy says. \"It was as if her and I were in the room alone.” \nWhat did you think of Jeremy and Jinger’s wedding? Sound off below. \nCounting On airs on TLC Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.
