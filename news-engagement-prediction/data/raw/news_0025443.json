SPX market capitalisation on Monday beyond $20 trillion for the first time. \nWhile mutual funds have largely bet on Apple in recent months, some big names missed out on all or part of its recent acceleration. \nHedge fund manager Dan Loeb's Third Point LLC cut its stake in Apple by 26 per cent to 1.9 million shares in the fourth quarter, according to regulatory filings, while George Soros and Carl Icahn also shed their Apple shares last year.

David Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital in January said it still likes Apple. \nApple has climbed 50 per cent from lows in the first half of last year and is up 15 per cent so far in 2017. It was still short of its all-time intraday high of $134.54, set on April 28, 2015. \nMonday's gain came after Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski raised her price target for Apple to $150. She said she is more confident that an upcoming 10th anniversary iPhone will feature augmented-reality technology, which could help boost demand in a saturated smartphone market. \nMany investors are betting that Apple will mark the iPhone's 10th anniversary with a dramatically improved model. They also believe that strong sales of the iPhone 6S two years ago have left a larger-than-normal base of customers ready to upgrade.

It now accounts for about 3.5 per cent of the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. \nThe 721 days that have passed since Apple's previous record-high close represent the largest gap between such milestones since the iPhone's launch in 2007.
