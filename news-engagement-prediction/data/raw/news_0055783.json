The Winnipeg Jets saw something similar in Patrik Laine when things went sideways.\nThe first two picks of the 2016 draft appear to be handling their historic rookie seasons in similar fashion. It's not just the impressive results the teenage sensations of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Winnipeg Jets have managed already, but the confidence and coolness with which they've performed under immense pressure.\n\"If a shift doesn't go well he's going to be upset for 20, 30 seconds, he might say a few choice words and then he's right back out there and he's probably going to ring one off the cross-bar the next shift,\" Jets centre Adam Lowry said of the 18-year-old Laine. \"I think it's that mentality that he knows he can be good and believes in himself.\"\nLeafs players credit that same strong self-belief for Matthews' consistent performance. The 19-year-old has produced at nearly a point per-game pace and has yet to go more than three games without a goal since snapping out of that dry spell in late November.\n\n\"I think it's just part of his personality,\" veteran Leafs defenceman Matt Hunwick said, crediting Matthews for his composure in front of the large Toronto media contingent. \"He seems like a very serious person when he's around the rink.\"\nToronto winger James van Riemsdyk thinks Matthews probably developed some of that confidence — \"he's not intimidated and overwhelmed by any situation\" —when he thrived against men in the top Swiss league last season. The same could be said of Laine, who diced up the best Finnish league last year before shining internationally at both the world junior and world hockey championships.\nHe then stepped up with a hat trick in his fourth NHL game, almost equalling Matthews' historic four-goal NHL debut.\n\"When I was his age I was playing junior, you know what I'm saying,\" Jets forward Mathieu Perrault said.\nPerrault started his NHL career in Washington alongside Alex Ovechkin, the high-flying Russian scorer with whom Laine has long been compared. Perrault sees similarity only in the way the two shoot the puck, saying Laine is more of a skilled winger in contrast to the physically imposing Ovechkin.\n\"Actually my dad had a pretty good comparison,\" Perrault said. \"He thinks (Laine) looks a lot like what Mario Lemieux looked like when he came in the league. Tall guy, not overly fast, but fast — it doesn't look fast, but he is. Tall, lanky, good hands. My dad thinks he looks a lot like Mario Lemieux.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:46:08.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
