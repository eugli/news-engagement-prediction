A further reaction was one of positivity and cautious optimism, since there were also many proposals, none major, but welcome overall, that seemed likely to improve the business climate and future growth. Perhaps, on the “doing business” front, there was less than the corporate sector might have hoped for—no cut in tax rates except for the smallest firms, and little in the way of new incentives for start-ups. But, there were other places in the budget where, on reflection, there may be the beginnings of a massive change in the Indian economy. Let’s look at these positives, then consider some cautions.\nIn my view, the move to facilitate greater investment in affordable housing by giving it infrastructure status has enormous potential. India’s real estate sector has been tilted toward the well-off. Other policy moves have been aimed at choking off the use of high-end real estate as a vehicle for tax evasion or laundering the gains from such evasion, and demonetisation had severely impacted the sector. But this budget combines planned improvements in the design of infrastructure contracts, the ability of foreigners to invest, and this move in affordable housing, implying greater access to financing. If implemented well, with effective coordination, a massive construction programme of working-class housing can transform the lives of the majority of Indians. One major coordinating policy will be with respect to sanitation infrastructure, and I will return to that.\nThe second potentially transformative move that was signalled in the Budget was the promise to rationalise labour laws. A brief statement in the Budget speech summarised the vision very well: “Legislative reforms will be undertaken to simplify, rationalise and amalgamate the existing labour laws into 4 Codes on (i) wages; (ii) industrial relations; (iii) social security and welfare; and (iv) safety and working conditions.” If something can be achieved here in a relatively short period of time, it will mark one of the most significant steps in India’s decades-long reform process. The statement signals concern for worker rights and welfare, but it is widely recognised that the current legislative regime does a poor job overall of protecting worker welfare, while it simultaneously raises the costs of hiring workers in an inefficient manner.\nYou May Also Want To Watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T09:22:12.559+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
