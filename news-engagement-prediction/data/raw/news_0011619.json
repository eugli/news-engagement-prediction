Ad Feedback \nThe child was malnourished, badly bruised and cut, scarred with whip marks, and had infected ankles, local media News9 reported. \nShe told hospital staff her grandmother would put on a green mask with red eyes to dress up as a witch named \"Nelda\", and would \"take a pink dog leash and hang her in the middle of the garage underneath her arms\". \nNelda would use a \"wand knife\" and put it to her neck, she said. \nThe girl also said Robinson threatened the \"creatures in the attic were going to get her\". \nPolice officers who showed up at the house to investigate found evidence which corroborated the child's accounts, News9 reported. \nThey found dog leashes attached to the garage door railings on the ceiling, a witch's costume and a dagger prop. \nRobinson is due to be sentenced on March 28. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:11:04.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
