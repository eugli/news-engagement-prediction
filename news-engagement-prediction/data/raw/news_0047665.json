The spirited young Selin watches as her sister Wawa is betrothed to a man outside the village - but Wawa wants to be with Dain. The lovers run away. Selin follows as the villagers set off to find her sister - and tragedy looms. \nWill it win? The least mainstream of this year's nominees is exactly the kind of film the Academy hoped would benefit from reforming the voting system. It's a well-shot and mainly well-acted story filmed on a South Pacific island far from the usual movie-world support systems. The story, with its echo of Romeo and Juliet, is engrossing and in its early stages charming. Locations are attractive without resembling an ad for upmarket beach holidays. It won't take the Oscar but it's worth catching. TONI ERDMANN Image copyright Sony Pictures Classics \nCountry: Germany \nLanguage: German, English and Romanian \nGermany's track Record: 18 nominations (including one for East Germany) and a total of 3 wins \nDirector: Maren Ade \nStory: Winfried (who adopts the name Toni) has a distant relationship with his daughter Ines, a business consultant working in Bucharest. He decides to leave Germany to pay her a visit, not wholly to her pleasure. Ines is climbing in her career and finds some of her eccentric father's activities a pain. But she tries to tolerate him and passes him off to colleagues as her life coach. A late scene suggests they have re-established some kind of family intimacy, but the question is left open. \nWill it win? The film got a lot of attention at last year's Cannes Festival - often along the lines of 'Amazing - a German comedy!'. The fact that large sections are in English won't harm its chances and it's built up a head of steam which may well grab it the Oscar. The simple description comedy underplays the story's ambiguities and some audiences will be surprised that certain scenes are far from comic. The film's half an hour too long. A Hollywood remake has been announced, to star Jack Nicholson and Kristen Wiig. Could that incline Academy voters to back the original? \nThe Academy Awards are held on 26 February. \nFollow us on Facebook , on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts , or on Instagram at bbcnewsents .
