Jimmy Johnson, who coached the Cowboys to back-to-back Super Bowl wins starting that 1992-1993 season, was among those on hand to congratulate Jones. Jimmy Johnson: Jerry Jones deserves to be in the Hall of Fame for all he's accomplished with Cowboys and the league. \"I'm happy for him.\" \n— Jon Machota (@jonmachota) February 26, 2017 \nHowever, it hadn’t been forgotten that Johnson departed Dallas in 1994 after that second title, due to differences with Jones. Former Cowboys CB Kevin Smith: \"If Jimmy Johnson had stayed there's no telling how many Super Bowls we would've won.\" \n— Jon Machota (@jonmachota) February 26, 2017 \nBut Jones told the Dallas Morning News that their relationship is “very good” these days, and Johnson was effusive in his praise for his old boss. \n“I talked to Jerry at the Super Bowl and congratulated him on going into the Hall of Fame. I talked to the media prior to that and I said without question he deserves to be in there,” Johnson said. “You look at what the impact he has made on the NFL since he’s been in the league; the value of every franchise can be attributed really to Jerry Jones. His passion, his work ethic and what he’s done for the league he deserved to in there and I’m happy for him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T11:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T06:47:32.304+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
