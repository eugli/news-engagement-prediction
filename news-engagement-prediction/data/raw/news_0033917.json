(ABC News: Michael Coggan) \nMr Olds said the car the team was building for this year's World Solar Challenge would be very different from the previous entry. \n\"It's going to have 30 per cent less drag, it's going to be a whole lot more efficient, faster and lighter,\" he said. \nStudents from Flinders University are building a four-passenger solar car as they prepare to compete in the cruiser passenger-car class of the event for the first time. \nTeam director Dr Stuart Wildy said technology developed by the university would be built into the car including a telemetry system that enabled car-to-car communication in areas with no mobile phone coverage and regenerative suspension that used movement to charge the car's batteries. \nDr Wildy said there were also plans to integrate technology developed by autonomous vehicle manufacturer RDM to develop a self-driving solar car. \nHe also believes it is highly likely that the innovative work being done by students competing in the World Solar Challenge will lead to cars of the future being built in Australia. \n\"We have a number of companies coming to Adelaide now that are looking to develop electric vehicles and autonomous vehicles,\" he said.

(ABC News: Michael Coggan) \nThe World Solar Challenge Director Chris Selwood said the IMAX exposure would show an international audience a largely untold Australian story. \n\"It will show that Australia cares about environmental issues, that Australia cares about innovation, advanced manufacturing, all those wonderful things that we are very good at,\" he said. \nThe 30th anniversary World Solar Challenge race starts in Darwin on October 8 and runs until October 15. \nAt this stage there is no release date for the movie to be shown in Australia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:40:00.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
