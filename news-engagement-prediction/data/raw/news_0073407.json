Pollak\nSan Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo failed to protect his city’s residents from anti-Donald Trump riots last June. Now he has failed to protect them from flooding. The city was forced to evacuate 14,000 residents earlier this week as the Coyote Creek overflowed its banks, bringing a potentially toxic flood of water contaminated with fuel and sewage.\nCity officials, however, had underestimated the danger. The San Jose Mercury News notes that they only expected flooding to happen if flow rates in the creek exceeded 7,400 feet per second. They did exceed that rate — but flooding had begun even before that. The city relied on faulty assumptions and failed to warn residents, meaning that the first time many people found out they had to leave was when they were told they had to do so by emergency responders moving through flooded streets.\n“If the first time a resident is aware that they need to get out of a home is when they see a firefighter in a boat, then clearly there has been a failure,” Mayor Liccardo admitted, according to the Los Angeles Times . “There is no question that we’ll need to do things differently next time.”\nResidents endured what the Times describes as “harrowing” escapes, and expressed anger at not being warned.\nThe flooding marks the second major controversy for Liccardo in less than a year. When mobs of anti-Trump protesters attacked and bloodied Trump supporters leaving a political rally as police stood by, Mayor Liccardo blamed Trump for the violence: “At some point Donald Trump needs to take responsibility for the irresponsible behavior of his campaign,” he said.\nEarlier this year, Liccardo also vowed to maintain San Jose’s status as a “sanctuary city” for illegal aliens, and to defy federal immigration laws, despite warning in an executive order issued by the president.\nNow, however, it appears that Liccardo cannot even provide the most basic sanctuary to his own residents.\nJoel B.
