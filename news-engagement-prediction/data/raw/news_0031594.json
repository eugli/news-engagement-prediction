Media caption Kellyanne Conway said Gen Flynn either \"misled\" or \"could not completely recall\" his conversation \nIn his first public comments about the controversy, President Trump tweeted on Tuesday : \"The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N Korea etc?\" \nRepublican John McCain , chairman of the Senate armed services committee, said Mr Flynn's resignation was a \"troubling indication of the dysfunction of the current national security apparatus\" which raised questions about Mr Trump's intentions towards Russia. \nSenator Roy Blunt , a Republican member of the Senate intelligence committee, called for an investigation into any alleged connections between Mr Trump and Russian officials. \nTexas Senator John Cornyn , the second-ranked Senate Republican leader, echoed calls for an investigation. \nMeanwhile, US House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes , also Republican, told reporters on Tuesday he wanted to investigate the leaks that led to Mr Flynn's resignation. He also said the FBI should explain why Mr Flynn's conversation had been recorded. \nHowever, House speaker Paul Ryan sidestepped questions on whether he backed an independent investigation. The Senate's most senior Republican, Mitch McConnell , said the intelligence committee was already looking into Russian influence on the election, indicating there was no need for a new investigative panel. And Russia? \nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would not be commenting on the resignation. \n\"This is the internal affair of the Americans, the internal affair of the Trump administration,\" he added. \"It's nothing to do with us.\" Image copyright AP Image caption Mr Flynn was pictured dining with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in December 2015 What happens next? \nSenior Democrat Adam Schiff said Mr Flynn's departure would not end questions about contacts between the Trump's campaign and Russia. \nCongressional Democrats John Conyers and Elijah Cummings have demanded a classified briefing to Congress on Michael Flynn by the justice department and FBI. \n\"We in Congress need to know who authorised his actions, permitted them, and continued to let him have access to our most sensitive national security information despite knowing these risks,\" their statement said. \nSeveral House Democrats had already called on Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to launch an investigation into Mr Flynn's ties to Russia. \nOn another busy day for the Trump administration: The US Office of Government Ethics called on the White House to investigate adviser Kellyanne Conway for plugging Ivanka Trump products on television. The chairman of the House standards committee wants to know more about security measures at Mr Trump's Florida retreat after photos were posted on Facebook of the president taking a call about North Korea. The president signed an executive order rolling back a regulation that required oil and gas companies to disclose certain foreign payments.
