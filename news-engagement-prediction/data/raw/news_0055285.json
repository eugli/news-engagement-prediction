You thought her dressing in this way was provocative?\" Crown prosecutor Jacinda Foster said to Kuggeleijn. \n\"Yes, and the way she acted,\" Kuggeleijn said. \nFoster asked what the defendant meant by his answer, to which Kuggeleijn replied, \"She was exposing a bit more parts of her body than other girls do... I thought she must be quite confident.\" \nFoster suggested Kuggeleijn formed the view that the complainant was a \"very sexual woman\". \n\"Did you decide that she was looking for someone to hook up,\" Foster said. \n\"I though it was a possibility I guess, I wasn't thinking too much about that,\" Kuggeleijn told the court. Ad Feedback \nOn the night before the alleged incident in May 2015, Kuggeleijn and the complainant were drinking at an 18th birthday party with a group of mutual friends. \nDuring some stage in the night, the defendant allegedly told a friend that he thought the complainant \"loved penis\". \nFoster quizzed him on this. \n\"A woman that loved penis; [is this] expressing the view that she was a woman who loved sex?\" Foster said. \n\"Yeah, well sex or whatever, whatever she wanted... Those are words said after a fair bit of alcohol at a party. Not necessarily just sex but that comes into it I suppose,\" Kuggeleijn said. \n\"She looked like she liked a lot of male attention, she liked males.\" \nKuggeleijn denied forcing himself onto the complainant and said she was lying when Foster referred to evidence read to the court by the complainant on Monday. \n\"I suggest that when she tried to resist you, you were more forceful about it... doing the things she knew would arouse you, but not letting you have sex.\" \n\"I did not force myself on her like she said,\" Kuggeleijn said, \"She is lying, yes.\" \nDefence counsel Philip Morgan, QC, asked Kuggeleijn whether he and the complainant were \"completely engaged\" during their time together. \nTo which Kuggeleijn said, yes. \n\"She seemed liked she was into it... she wanted it to happen.\" \nThe trial opened before Judge David Wilson, QC, at the Hamilton District Court on Monday. \nEarlier in the week, the court heard from the complainant and five other witnesses for the Crown. \nThe complainant described being so intoxicated that she could not remember parts of her night, specifically being in town with Kuggeleijn. \nThe alleged rape happened when they returned to her flat in the early hours of the next morning after hours of drinking. \nMorgan, QC, and Foster will give their closing statements on Thursday. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T11:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:24:30.044+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
