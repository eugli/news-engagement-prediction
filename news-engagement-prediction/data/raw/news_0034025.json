CAP would like to congratulate the Domestic Trade, Cooperatives and Consumerism Ministry for following up on the discovery of the 90 paint brushes. We hope that harsh action will be taken against the perpetrators. \nGenerally, brushes made from pig’s bristles are labelled as ‘pure bristles’ and may range from paint brushes to brushes for songkok, shoes, toothbrushes, and shaving brushes. \nBrushes made from pig’s bristles are comparatively much cheaper than those manufactured from hair of horses and donkeys. Moreover, the bristles are better at retaining paint. \nApart from brushes, some branded expensive bags are also made from pig leather. However, it is commonly used in products from China and other developing countries. \nOther items that are made from pig’s skin include leather gloves, jackets, shoes, handbags, and wallets. \nMost pig leather looks like suede leather (from cow hide) but has spots that look like depressed points or small holes. \nAnother item to safely stay away is crockery labelled as ‘fine bone china’ because is made from animal bones. Muslims are advised to use crockery made from either glass or ceramics. \nCAP would reiterate our urging to the government to create a separate Halal/Haram Act to deal with the issue and place it under the jurisdiction of the Islamic Development Department of Malaysia (Jakim) and for the Muslim community to be more diligent when buying products that may contain haram substances. \nSM MOHAMED IDRIS is president, Consumers Association of Penang. \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:22:51.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
