Will Modi magic work in UP, Uttarakhand, Goa, Punjab & Manipur? NEW DELHI: An indomitable North Korea has confirmed that it had successfully test-fired a new medium to long-range ballistic missile Pukguksong-2 on February 12 (Sunday), which is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. It also claimed advancement in its weapons programme, which other countries alleged a violation of UN resolutions. Meanwhile, the US is rushing to deploy its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in South Korea before the next elections as it thinks that if current opposition party wins, they might overturn the decision. Russia and China have thrown their weight against it. Russia has said the US missile system will negatively affect global strategic stability, while China has opposed it because it believes that the THAAD deployment will seriously damage its security interest. China's agitation arises from its belief that the THAAD radar system will invade Chinese territory. China is also of the view that THAAD is not conducive to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. What is THAAD and its strength? Lockheed Martin's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) is an anti-ballistic missile system that can destroy short to intermediate-range enemy missiles in their terminal phase, but it can't detect missiles when they are in boost or mid-course phase. [Ballistic missile trajectories are divided into three phases - boost (When it is fired), midcourse (When it is in the middle of its route), and terminal (The target where it terminates)] It uses hit-to-kill technology to destroy enemy missiles by kinetic energy. It has a range of 200 km and can reach altitudes of 150 km. It is equipped with a X-Band Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, THAAD Fire Control and Communication Support Equipment (TFCC) and a truck launcher. (Courtesy: â€‹ lockheedmartin.com) The working of THAAD can be classified into four stages post enemy missile launch: 1. The radar detects the enemy missile 2. The TFCC identifies and engages the target 3. The launcher truck is instructed to fire the interceptor missile 4. The interceptor missile uses kinetic energy to destroy the enemy missile (Courtesy: lockheedmartin.com) Drawbacks THAAD is less efficient against missiles with an unstable trajectory. THAAD's radar collects its data based on the exterior properties of a missile like its shape and brightness. If enemy fires a decoy missile among the real missile, it may easily decept THAAD system. Let's take a detail look at the THAAD and why Russia, China are opposing it, while the US and South Korea want it at earliest: Russia's anxiety Russia has said time and again that the US plan of THAAD deployment remains a cause of concern for them. Russian Ambassador to Seoul Aleksandr Timonin has said that Russia regards this move as the US's effort to create a new regional segment of Washington's global missile defence strategy. Timonin has said also said that THAAD is a direct threat to Russian security as the main aim of US global missile defense is to minimize the effectiveness of Russia's missile potential. Russian Defence Minister Anatoly Antonov has also criticised THAAD, saying that it will escalate the regional tension. Antonov has clearly said that THAAD deployment goes beyond the task of deterring the North Korean threat. \"During the meeting, Antonov stressed the importance of political-diplomatic resolution of the situation on the Korean Peninsula aimed at preventing the escalation of tensions in North Eastern Asia,\" stated a Sputnik report quoting Russian Defence Ministry statement . China's fear: China has gone tough on South Korea after the latter jointly announced THAAD deployment with the US. China has taken over 40 retaliatory actions against South Korea since then and recently, it has denied South Korean air carriers the permission to add charter flights between the two countries - a move that will drastically hit the South Korean tourism sector. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang has strongly opposed the proposed move. \"I want to stress again that the deployment of THAAD will in no way help achieve peace and stability on the Peninsula and still less contribute to the resolution of the nuclear issue of the Peninsula. China is strongly opposed to the decision because it in particular severely undermines China's strategic security interests. We strongly ask the US and the ROK to change course,\" said Lu Kang . China has said that THAAD poses threat to its security interests in the region, while the US has said that no other country needs to fear THAAD, because it is solely aimed at North Korea's growing nuclear and missile threat. Though the THAAD will be deployed in the Korean Peninsula aimed at North Korea, its ability to trace Chinese missile is negligible. However, China fears that it can be relocated/refocused against it. It also fears that THAAD's X-band radar can look deep into China if configure to 'Look mode', said a report in Center for Strategic & International Studies attributing Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. 'Serious' Japan Seeing THAAD's defence capabilities, Japan is getting serious about it and may soon start its plan to procure the dreaded missile system. Japanese Defence Minister Tomomi Inada has also said that the country is exploring possibilities of acquiring an intercepting missile system. Japan already has advanced missile defense systems in place with the deployment of PAC-3 and Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptors. The SM-3 interceptors are based on the Block 1A system and can shoot down missiles at an altitude of more than 100 km while the PAC-3 Patriot rockets has a range of 20 km. The PAC-3 missiles are slower, has a shorter range and are less capable interceptor. Therefore, THAAD will only add strength to its existing system. South Korea's aspiration North Korea's defence policy is very aggressive as its nuclear arsenal with new missiles is spiralling aggressively. According to a recent report, South Korea claimed that North Korea could own 45 nuclear weapons by 2020. And that is where the thought of a strong missile defence system comes. As Pyongyang is rapidly piling up weapons, South Korea felt a strong need of a robust missile intercepting system and that existed in the form of THAAD. South Korea already has some narrow and low-altitude missile defence system such as PAC-2 and 3 and therefore, THAAD will give South Korea a higher-altitude defence system to counter North Korean threats. The range of PAC-2 system is 160 km and falls under low-high altitude air defence system. The US was also concerned about the rising North Korean arsenal and then it joined hands with South Korea to deploy THAAD at its own cost as the latter has refused to bear the same. It will only provide the land and other facilities required to deploy the THAAD while the US will bear the cost of single THAAD system that costs around $1.3 billion. After Donald Trump became the president, he said South Korea should take care of its defence expenses instead of a free ride from the US. \"Donald Trump has suggested that the United States should allow South Korea and Japan to go nuclear rather than continue to rely on American security guarantees. He generally argued that our allies gain a competitive economic advantage by shifting their defense burdens onto the United States,\" said a Vox.com news report . However, US Secretary of Defence James Mattis assured South Korea of full cooperation and reaffirmed the ties between the two countries.
