So I was like, \"OK, this person wants me to do this? Cool.\"\n'And then all of a sudden I realized that these projects are just not me. That’s when I shifted toward more meaningful things.'\nOnce she realised she could be more deliberate about the projects she selected, Emily refined her portfolio - ditching the raunchy music videos for film roles (she appeared in 2014's Gone Girl) and a catwalk career.\nStrike a pose: Talking to InStyle, on whose March cover she features, the brunette clotheshorse explained that initially she treated modelling as a money-making opportunity\nUpdate your denim with Emily's Re/Done jeans £232.44 Re/Done Levi's jeans\nEmulate Emily\nBuy now\nEmily Ratajkowski made a casual but oh so cool cover girl for this month's In Style, wearing a t-shirt specially designed by Off/White, teamed with Re/Done jeans.\nLook inside the wardrobe of any modern day style icon and you'll find one thing in common: a pair of Levi's jeans. More specifically, a pair of Levi's jeans from new brand on the block Re/Done.\nIt was set up by Sean Barron and Jamie Mazur (brother of stylist Jennifer Mazur, and fiancée to supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio) after they noticed the fashion-pack couldn't get enough of Levi's.\nThey had the brainwave to establish Re/Done, which involves taking apart original Levi's and re-working them, so the jeans then have a much more modern fit.\nUnderstandably, they've been a huge hit - Emily regularly wears them in real life too, along with other A-listers like Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid.
