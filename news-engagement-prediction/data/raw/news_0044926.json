Speaking on The Today Show in the USA he said: “Here’s the thing: it was all CGI, so it was motion capture, puppeteering, the suit… and then the face was done separately using a different technology. \n“So when I was on set, I was on stilts in a big muscle suit covered in lycra. Everything else looked gorgeous, Emma Watson was beautiful, the sets were incredible… and there’s me just sweating away! \n“And over the months I’ve seen it emerge. These guys at Disney putting every digital hair on my digital face. It’s been amazing.” Two scenes the director has said to look out for \nThe film is being presented in an expanded aspect ratio which means you get to see 26 per cent more of the scenes. \nCondon told Nerdist : “We built this entire village with massive sets and huge stages that we connected. So, for example, you could go from the dining room of the castle and walk all the way through to the entry way, to the front stairs, and into this massive ballroom. It was really something. I think that does emerge clearly in the IMAX format.” \nThere's two in particular director Bill Condon feels fans should look out for - the iconic ballroom scene and a fight scene. Beauty and the Beast's ballroom scene is one to look out for (Photo: YouTube/Disney) \n“The ballroom. Being able to go in that room and have it always framed by the chandeliers, which are incredibly high in the air, always have them framing the top of the shot just adds more. Our movie is pretty much packed with beauty, but you get to see more of it and the ballroom scene is a great example.” \nThe turret fight looks great in the new ratio apparently because of the “sense of being high in the air and the sense of danger you feel as the Beast is forced to jump from turret to turret, twenty stories in the air.” \nThis last bit will reassure fans too. \n“In general, it wasn’t about reinventing like some of these recent movies have been. It was really about exploring and digging deeper, inevitably, because you’re bringing people into a live action world. My deepest hope is people see the movie and feel that the additional scenes and the additional material is stuff they always wondered about and wished had been there, so they don’t even remember what was in the animated film and what wasn’t. That it all becomes of a piece.” Character posters \nThe latest posters give us a look at the main characters up close.
