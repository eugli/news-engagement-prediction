There's a lot of evidence Facebook is copying Snapchat's features,\" Mr Garner said.\nBut with Facebook drawing in 1.2 billion daily users, Snapchat needs to prove it can have general appeal, he added.\nKeen to show it can make revenue from sources other than advertising, Snapchat rebranded itself as Snap last year, and debuted its video-camera sunglasses called Spectacles.\nThe kit can connect to smartphones and send video and photos to the app.\nLast month, the firm said it had established its non-US office in London.\nSnap said it would pay taxes on UK and some international sales through the hub.", "external_links": ["http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/16A17/production/_92459629_gettyimages-622928998.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37996314", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/34C9/production/_93931531_nysesnapchatreuters.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38567898", "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1564408/000119312517029199/d270216ds1.htm"], "published": "2017-02-03T07:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:28:57.600+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
