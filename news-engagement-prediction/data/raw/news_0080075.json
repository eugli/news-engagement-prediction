If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nTwo days ago, Conservative leadership candidate Kellie Leitch released a campaign video about her proposal to screen new arrivals for Canadian values. \nOn Monday, people roasted the video on Twitter, where one person compared it to a “ weird hate-induced fever dream .” \nThe video shows Leitch sitting in an office and talking about her controversial proposal, which would see immigration officials conduct face-to-face interviews with “all people who seek to come here,” including immigrants, refugees and visitors to Canada. \n“Through these interviews we can make sure that the people who come to Canada share our historic values, the values enshrined in our constitution, ” she said. \nBut this time, her policy didn’t prove as controversial as her video pitch, which drew plenty of attention on social media for its unusual pacing, blocking and shooting. ‘You think Kellie Leitch should have her own party?’: Trudeau’s response to electoral reform \nThe video’s opening shot has Leitch looking into a camera that tracks awkwardly from right to left, though it never loses her gaze. \nThroughout the video, Leitch repeatedly looks away from the camera, up, down, and side to side. \nIt also alternates between two different angles: one that shows Leitch looking right into the lens, and one that doesn’t. \nTwitter user Warren Piers said it was one of the more “bizarre things I’ve seen lately.” This Kellie Leitch video is among the more bizarre things I've seen lately. https://t.co/xIcq80HW5d \n— Warren Piers (@wpiers1) February 27, 2017 \nRadio producer Katie Jensen compared Leitch’s video to a failed audition tape. Dear Kellie, \n— Katie Jensen (@katiejensen) February 28, 2017 \nToronto Star commentator Paul Wells explained his reluctance to tweet the video at all. Going back and forth on whether to tweet Kellie Leitch's new video, because simply expanding its audience seems cruel to her. \n— Paul Wells (@InklessPW) February 26, 2017 \nOne Twitter user said the video renewed their confidence in their public speaking ability. But after watching this Kellie Leitch video, I honestly feel like I'm an amazing public speaker, excessive \"ums\" and all. \nAnd progressive political organizer Nadine Tkatchevskaia called it a “true masterpiece of Canadian politics.” This is a true masterpiece of Canadian politics. I don't even know where to start #cpcldr https://t.co/RSjl4fL9Ft \n— Nadine Tkatchevskaia (@nadinetkat) February 27, 2017 \nBut Leitch’s Canadian Values screening has drawn plenty of attention without the video’s help. \nEarlier this month, she called the Quebec City shootings that killed six men an “outrageous act of violence,” but she remained firm on her screening proposal , calling it a “common sense policy.” \nA banner was subsequently draped at her constituency office that said, “Hate puts us all at risk” and listed the names of the Quebec City shooting victims. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
