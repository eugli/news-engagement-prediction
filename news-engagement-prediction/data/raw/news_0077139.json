Last week, McGee tweeted at Shaq, which prompted the NBA's most intense war overnight . \nShaq's mom may have just brought this feud to an end. \nIn an interview with The Undefeated , Shaq said that he got a call from his mom, Lucille, who told him to leave McGee alone. Shaq intends on heeding to his mother's wishes. \nVia The Undefeated : \n\"No,\" O'Neal said. \"My mama. Just say Shaq's mom called him, told him, 'Stop this silliness. Leave him alone.' So that's the end of the beef. You won't be hearing about it from my side anymore. Mama has spoken.\" \nSaid Lucille O'Neal earlier Saturday evening from her Orlando, Florida, home, \"It's not funny anymore, seeing the things they're saying to each other. They need to squash this and move on.\" \nMcGee's mother, Pamela, wasn't as quick to move on, though. She'd like to see Shaq face some discipline from his bosses at Turner Sports and the NBA. \n\"He cyberbullied my son. Totally inappropriate. Shaquille needs to lose his job or be suspended. The NBA needs to make a stand.\" \nIn the meantime, Shaq promises that he's done with the McGee beef.
