Emma Stone accepts Best Actress Oscar for La La Land from Leonardo DiCaprio Credit: Kevin Winter/Getty Images Adam Boult 27 February 2017 ‚Ä¢ 10:38am \nD id Leonardo DiCaprio engineer a huge blunder at the 2017 Oscars to get revenge on the Academy for the years he was denied an award? \nShort answer: no - but it's nevertheless a fun conspiracy theory. \nIn the minutes and hours following the extraordinary Oscars 2017 Best Picture mix-up - in which Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced that La La Land had won the award, rather than actual winner Moonlight - social media flew into a frenzy of speculation over why the error had taken place. \nA number of amateur sleuths quickly identified one unlikely culprit - Leonardo DiCaprio. \nThe Leo-did-it conspiracy theorists noted Warren Beatty's explanation for why he'd named the wrong film - he'd been handed the wrong card. \nBut where did the card come from? Watch | Moonlight wins Best Picture after La La Land mistakenly named winner 02:06 \nI mmediately prior to the Best Picture announcement, Emma Stone had accepted her award for Best Actress - and DiCaprio, presenting, had walked off stage with the red card under his arm. \nAnd so, the theory goes, Leo's card had somehow ended up in Warren Beatty's hands: Okay but you know who the last person who had that Emma Stone/La La Land card was?
