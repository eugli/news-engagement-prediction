The pair left the Channel 9 dating show on Monday after the father-of-two chose to leave the “marriage” and broke up with Deb, who had asked for a Polynesian man , by letter. But since returning home to Sydney 53-year-old John has found himself a wanted man and he is still looking for a love match.. Channel 9 claimed it had been swamped with emails from single women begging for an introduction to John, who is quickly become the country’s most eligible bachelor. The introduction for around 10 women was set up and shown tonight on A Current Affair. There was Connie, “pushing 60”, who also has children. “I am a little bit older but think we would be a great match. I think John and I have a lot in common,” she gushed.

Come and approach me.” There was also 55-year-old Di, who declared: “We are all available”. “I have been separated for 18 months. It’s hard to find someone out there. When I saw John on TV, I just went, ‘Oh hello’. “He seems so genuine and came across so human. His love of his daughters just drew me ... I cried.” John was kept behind a curtain. His daughters Jessie and Emma were also there to check on any potential new mum. They also said they had been trying to organise their dad with a new date.

They might be very disappointed once they meet me,” John said. “Actually I’m really rapt. It has been fantastic.” The curtain was drawn open and John, whom Jess called “a very social person”, came out to meet his suitors. Lots of selfies were taken and John tried to meet as many women as he could. Some of the women were very forward, with one giving him a kiss on the cheek and another inviting him back to her place and her spa, which she said was lonely when on her own.
