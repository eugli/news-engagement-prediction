It put the Falcons up 7-0 with just over 12 minutes left in the first half after both teams were held scoreless in the first quarter. \nSome believed Freeman’s dive may have warranted a flag, but because he dove before entering the end zone, it was not a penalty. Not a foul for going to the ground to celebrate. He went from the field of play into the EZ. Would have been a foul if he scored first. \n— Mike Pereira (@MikePereira) February 6, 2017 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:01:40.775+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
