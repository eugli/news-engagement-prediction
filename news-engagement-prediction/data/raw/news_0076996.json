ADVERTISEMENT \nHowever, much to the despair of the island locals, seven hogs have reportedly been found dead, and they are pointing to tourists as the primary culprits. \nAccording to the Guardian, out of the 22 pigs that the island has, only 15 are seen roaming the island, allegedly due to the inappropriate behavior of some of the vacationers. \n“The pigs were given the wrong food,” Wayde Nixon, one of the pig owners, told the news outlet. “Right now, it’s blowing out of proportion with people, anybody bringing food there, anybody doing what they [want to] do,” he said. \n“We have people coming there giving the pigs beer, rum, riding on top of them―all kind of stuff,” he added. \nDespite the malicious claims, Bahams Humane Society President Kim Aranha said they were still uncertain what caused the pig’s deaths, and if they were accidental or incidental. \n“It could just be a horrible accident, where they ate something poisonous,” she said. “It could be malicious, but I don’t really see why someone would go out of their way to hurt those lovely animals.” \nResults of the humane society’s investigations are expected to be released next week. \nFor preventive measures, tourists will still be able to visit the pigs, but will no longer be permitted to feed them. \nMeanwhile, the lovable pigs first appeared on the island after Nixon and his business partner, Don Rolle, tried to start a farm in the 1990s. The bid failed, but the charm of the free-roaming, swimming pigs ended up becoming a must-see for island visitors. \nAside from Major Cay, the adored swimming pigs can be seen in the neighboring White Bay Cay. In their Instagram account @theswimminpigs, beach officials clarified some confusion regarding the pigs’ death, adding that the perished hogs did not belong to their island.
