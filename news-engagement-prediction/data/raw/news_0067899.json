Echoing a poster that was recently released for the new season , the trailer shows off some of the stunts and shenanigans in store for viewers. I’ve spoiled some in the headline, but there’s so much more that the hosts will be up to: Hitting ludicrous speed in the $2.6 million Bugatti Chiron . Attending a Soyuz rocket launch for some reason! Taking the GT Le Mans class Corvette for a trip around Daytona. Making penis jokes. Driving a Lamborghini and a Porsche in the snow, because why not. The Top Gear reboot was necessitated when two of its famous hosts quit in solidarity after the third famous host was fired for punching a producer. Unfortunately, the BBC’s first attempt at rebuilding the show employed a revolving carousel of hosts that spun so fast it made it possible to remember Destiny’s Child as singing group with a stable lineup. Thanks to a few more departures, Top Gear has now settled on three hosts — Matt LeBlanc, Chris Harris, and Rory Reid — who seem to have the right kind of rapport (and none of the punching) that made the show famous in the first place. We’ll find out how that plays out on March 12th.
