Credit: PA \nPresident Donald Trump used a rally in Florida to once again accuse the media of reporting fake news and being part of a \"corrupt system\". \nSpeaking to supporters in an airport hanger in Melbourne the President said he had held the rally so he could speak \"without the filter of fake news\". \nMr Trump accused the \"dishonest media\" of publishing repeated false story as \"they had an agenda of their own\". \nHe said: \"I'm here because I want to be among my friends and among the people. \n\"I want to be in a room full of hard working American patriots, who love their country, who salute their flag and who pray for a better future.\" \nThe President insisted the White House was running \"so smoothly\" and described his plans for the future as \"big and bold\". \nHe confirmed Obama-care would be repealed and replaced by a policy that offered \"much better healthcare at a better cost\". \nFirst Lady Melania Trump introduced her husband at the rally and began with a recital of the Lord's Prayer. In reference to rumours about her past, she said:\"I will always say true to myself and be truthful to you no matter what the opposition are saying about me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:11:48.140+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
