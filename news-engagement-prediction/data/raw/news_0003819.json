You are obviously on one of those strict low-carb diets and you haven't had sugar for over a month. Yikes! Your only saving grace? \nSay hello to the momentous and all-consuming cheat day a.k.a. THE HUNGRY GAMES. This is a rare but important event where your hunger reaches its peak and destroys every ounce of willpower you have. On a scale of 1-to-10, we are talking 11. Where the only way to survive is to eat a plate of honey-glazed chicken wings...in one go. A game where downing three mojitos is just not enough. A game where...you get the drill… These are the 7 quintessential stages of The Hungry Games. 1. When you’re really into exotic cocktails. Especially ones that come decorated with flowers and look like they’re made by unicorns. 2. When you suddenly have a strong craving for something sugary… 3. Even though you’re off sugar, just one lick wouldn't KILL you… 4. When the universe is centered on a plate of spicy chicken wings... 5. Do you lift bro? Yes… if it's the Social China Box with yummy tossed-up noodles inside… 6. When you can't decide what to order... 7. But you obviously end up ordering EVERYTHING on the menu... \nAll the dishes featured and hundreds more are a part of Dineout’s Great Indian Restaurant Festival (GIRF) , which is India’s first restaurant festival, starting from the 1 February to 10 February, where over 1,000 restaurants are offering amazing discounts. You can avail offers from five categories of discounts - 50% off Food, 50% off Buffets, Special Deals (specially curated menus), 50% off Alcoholic Beverages and 50% Off Valentine’s Day Packages. \nLocation courtesy: SOCIAL HKV and RAASTA; Photographer: Aastha Manchanda; Fashion Editor: Santu Misra; Make-up and Hair: Shallu Chandla; Models: Palak, Varun, Anoushka, Shaurya Don't Miss ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T11:46:16.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
