While there, the Democratic lawmaker revealed that he is far from the only person in Washington who is displeased with Trump’s performance. \nJoy Behar asked about Senator Al Franken ‘s claim that some Republicans are worried Trump is mentally unwell (and pointed out that she was ahead of the curve on saying that and caught major heat from Bill O’Reilly for it). \nHe replied, “When you talk to Republicans quietly — you know, in the cloak room and the gym — they are having real problems with him. Now, very few — John McCain , to his credit — but very few have had the courage to oppose hime even though they know he’s doing a lot of things that are against what America is all about.” \nHe went on to predict that Trump will be faced with a lot of Republicans turning from him in about three or four months. Schumer then called Trump’s cabinet the “worst cabinet” he’d ever seen and dismissed Trump’s war on the press by saying that everyone in power receives harsh coverage. \nHe advised Trump to get over it because the criticism can make politicians “better.” \nWatch above for all of that and to see what one topic Jedediah Bila said that all Republicans should agree with Schumer on. \n[image: screengrab] \nHave a tip we should know?
