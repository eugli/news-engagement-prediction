Photography Think you love Starbucks ? We're willing to bet you don't love it as much as this woman. Meet Kate Engelmaier , a 22-year-old recent college graduate and the blogger behind A Brave Mess . The Georgia resident is expecting her first child, a son named Max, on February 28. And she's celebrating her pregnancy with a Starbucks-themed maternity shoot. What does a Starbucks-themed maternity shoot entail, you ask? For Engelmaier, it involved baring her belly, painting it with a baby blue version of the Starbucks logo, and posing in her local Starbucks while holding the coffee chain's signature holiday red cups. Inspired by Sara Blakely's Belly Art Project —a book that featured over 100 celebrity mamas with their pregnant bellies painted—Engelmaier wanted her maternity photos to be \"as original, funny, and belly-worthy as the women in Sara’s book and online,\" she writes on her blog . The Starbucks theme came to her easily. \"The logo is shaped perfectly, it's something I adore, Max will love, and it's just plain fun,\" she explains on her blog. Engelmaier enlisted the help of her sister Lily, who is a photographer , and her friend Glory, to help paint her belly. After checking in with her local Starbucks to make sure she could pose in the store, Engelmaier was all set to go for her photo shoot. Take a look below at the end result: Lily Engelmaier/Lily E.
