Grants for two of her three sons were discontinued in 2010, when Athi was 14 years old and Simvile was 5. She never got a grant for her eldest son. \nGqadushe says she approached Sassa offices in Nyanga and in Gugulethu repeatedly, asking for the reinstatement of the grants and applying for a new grant for her third child, Lukho, born in 2011. Each time she was told to wait. In 2014 she returned to the offices to register another child, Iminathi, born the same year, and to check on progress with the other grants. Again, she says, she was told to wait. Vathiswa Gqadushe with (from left) Lukho, Iminathi, Enzokuhle and Simvile. (Mandla Mnyakama, GroundUp) \nMeanwhile Gqadushe had given birth to another child, Enzokuhle, in November. \nIt was a tough Christmas, she says. The elder children had started to scavenge from the neighbours’ rubbish bins, says Gqadushe, who relies on the financial support of her 61-year-old mother Nolisten, and on money earned from doing laundry for neighbours. The father of her older children died in 2011 and the father of the two youngest has left the family. \nFinally, on Monday, she got the first of several instalments of the funds Sassa owes her. Athi’s grant has ended because he is now 18, but his mother has received backpay for him and his brothers and sisters. \n“My children will finally have food,” said Gqadushe. \n“I will now be able to afford some of their needs. But I still wish that some investigation could be carried out to bring me clarity about why it has taken so long for the authorities to make the payout. No one has explained that to me yet.” \nShivani Wahab, Sassa Western Cape spokesperson, confirmed that the children’s grants had been approved. He did not explain the reasons for the delay. \nsubmitted via MyNews24 . Contributions of 200 words or more will be considered for publication.
