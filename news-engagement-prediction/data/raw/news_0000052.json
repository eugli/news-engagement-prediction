After a short amount of time The Wiggles start to feel like housemates, and I’ve considered taking out a restraining order on Giggle and Hoot – they’re mostly made up of bright colours and noise designed to distract, which underestimates the intelligence of little ones. I know a show is working when it holds up on the 98th viewing, and it’s a relief to find them – not just for my own sanity, but because something that is clever enough to entertain an adult is particularly nourishing for a kid. \nThere’s a great tradition of Australian kids television that doesn’t dumb things down, from The Ferals to Ship to Shore and Round the Twist. Even Play School, with its simple format, acknowledges its audience as clever people ready to thrive and learn – and I still take life lessons away from it. As kids mature, the successful shows deliver big drama and genre twists without glossing over what it’s really like to grow up – shows like the Wayne Manifesto, Heartbreak High and, more recently, Dance Academy, Nowhere Boys and the remake of Puberty Blues. \nAustralian television more broadly has been caught up in a swell of quality over the past five years. Best-of lists have been occupied by The Kettering Incident, Cleverman, Glitch, Barracuda, No Activity, Please Like Me, The Family Law, The Katering Show and The Code. They’re all decent shows, but most have been outclassed by a program that runs for only 15 minutes, on ABC Kids and iView. \nIntroducing: Little Lunch. \nBased on the book series written by Danny Katz and illustrated by Mitch Vane, Little Lunch is a funny, clever look at the 15 highly significant minutes of a child’s life that interrupt each day at primary school. Adapted by Wayne Hope and Robyn Butler –the husband and wife team behind Upper Middle Bogan and The Librarians – the show debuted in 2015, using the mockumentary format to profile six students: Atticus (Joshua Sitch, son of The Late Show alumni Rob Sitch and Jane Kennedy), Rory (Flynn Curry), Melanie (Madison Lu), Debra-Jo (Faith Seci), Tamara (Olivia Deeble) and Battie (Oisin O’Leary); and their teacher, Mrs Gonsha (Heidi Arena). So far, there have been 26 episodes and two specials. \nConsidering the popularity of the faux-doco style with hit shows like The Office, Parks and Recreation and Modern Family, it’s odd we haven’t been flooded with imitators in Australia. Chris Lilley took advantage of the format with We Can Be Heroes and Summer Heights High, but wore it out with a series of spinoffs. Little Lunch uses it perfectly. \nPerhaps that’s because kids instinctively know how to be overdramatic about the smallest things. Little Lunch has the characters talking to the camera, and they embellish the stories as they tell them. The camera cuts away to show what really happened, or set up jokes and visual gags. In one episode, a junior-school kid gets stuck on top of the highest tower in the senior playground – the students are serious about the turf war between juniors and seniors, one of the primary laws in the pecking order of primary school. The kids’ version of the story is epic, involving Mrs Gonsha climbing the tower with superhuman speed – which we never actually get to see. The doco style leverages the energetic way kids tell stories, to make the simplest things sound way more exciting than they really are – and it’s a fun world to be caught in. \nAnother genius is in the casting. Often, child actors can feel too rehearsed, or give off nauseating amounts of cuteness as if they’re trying to impress a stage parent off screen. But the kid ensemble of Little Lunch manages an authenticity that’s vital to the show’s success – and by dropping you straight in the “kid logic” headspace, the looniest things become acceptable. Battie (Oisin O’Leary), Tamara (Olivia Deeble), Melanie (Madison Lu), Atticus (Joshua Sitch), Debra-Jo (Faith Seci) and Rory (Flynn Curry): the child stars of Little Lunch.

That square of playground bitumen is their entire world for those precious minutes of freedom, and the stories focus on monkey bar battles, kiss chaseys and a visit from the health education bus. \nIn fact, each episode feels like a legendary tale from a playground somewhere; it’s hard not to get sucked back into your own memories of grade six, when anyone could be a king for a day on a handball court. \nPrimary school kids are cheeky but haven’t gotten street smart yet, and Hope and Butler capture the nuances perfectly. They never portray the kids as perfect little angels, but when the laughs settle there is an underlying sweetness to the way they look out for each other. The imagined worlds of the characters are hilarious, but so finely tuned to the thinking of a pre-teen: the legends of the playground, mysterious locations around the school and sudden absences of other students are all subject to wild theories. And amongst it all is Mrs Gonsha, who awkwardly navigates the kid world while being the one steadfast teacher every kid can rely on. \nHope and Butler pitched both Little Lunch and Upper Middle Bogan to the ABC on the same day – but with its joke hit rate and endearing heart, Little Lunch is their best work to date. They prove how much can be done in 15 minutes – an essential element, given the main audience is children whose attention spans are disappearing quicker than a packet of Tiny Teddy biscuits at recess. But most of all the success comes down to the goal set by its makers: to make a funny show that just happens to have kids in it. \nNo matter what your age, the universal code of the playground is a rite of passage – and Little Lunch taps into it wonderfully. \n• Little Lunch is available to stream on ABC iView ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:19:35.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
