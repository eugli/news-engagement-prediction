Leny told me about how, in Italy, she had experienced a lot of judgement and closed-mindedness. I sympathized. When I was 14, a rumor went around my Catholic high school that I was a lesbian, alienating me from everyone but a small group of my classmates. Later, I became an LGBTQ ally and helped found the Gay-Straight Alliance at my high school. When I told her that, Leny grinned ear-to-ear. Afterwards, she scampered, puppy-like, alongside me as I paced the exercise yard — the next day, and the day after that, and eventually every day.\" PHOTOS: Celebrity Mugshots Amanda Knox is a guest on \"Good Morning America,\" Thursday, September 29, 2016, airing on the ABC Television Network. Lou Rocco/ABC via Getty Images \nKnox described how they became “almost-friends.” She would let Leny listen to her CDs, and they would chat and play chess together. \"At least initially, Leny might not have been trying to seduce me, and was actually just in need of someone kind to distract her from her loneliness. This is common,” she wrote. \"Contrary to what you might guess, many prison relationships aren't about sex — just like most relationships outside of prison.” \nThe now-freelance journalist noted that intimacy in prison is strictly forbidden, and those in relationships face severe consequences, such as formal write-ups, solitary confinement or transfer to another facility. \"Leny wanted to hold hands. 'I've changed women before,' she'd tell me. 'I can do things to you that no man can.' I felt objectified and I'd get annoyed. 'You can't change me,’ I'd respond. She'd think I was playing hard to get,” Knox recalled.

It was bad enough that the prison institution took ownership of my body―that I was caged and strip-searched on a regular basis and had already been sexually harassed by male guards. As a prisoner, Leny should have understood that, but unlike me, Leny was serving a short stint, and didn't feel as acutely as I did the loss of privacy, dignity, and autonomy.\" \nKnox cited the support of her family and friends as the reason she didn’t need an intimate relationship while serving time. \"I told Leny that since she couldn't respect my boundaries, we couldn't be friends anymore. Things became tense,” she wrote. \"I was relieved when she was finally released, although she continued to write. She sent me jazz CDs which she inscribed on the inside jacket, 'Love always, Leny.' I never replied.\" \nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox! Add a Comment Sign Up for the Us Weekly Newsletter!
