In a tweet on Saturday, he called the club the \"Southern White House\" — and now people are even more convinced. On Twitter, critics are pointing out the already high cost of Trump's travels, particularly considering he frequently criticized President Obama for traveling. There's also the fact that dues at Mar-a-Lago just doubled to a cool $200,000 per year, making increased traffic at the resort profitable for Trump's business operation.\nAnd that's all separate from the security concerns .\nSEE ALSO: French video trolling Trump has a cock in it, because of course it does \nWill be having many meetings this weekend at The Southern White House.
