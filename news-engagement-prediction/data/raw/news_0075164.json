By Maressa Brown Comments \nPaul Zimmerman/Getty Images Today show anchor Savannah Guthrie has been off on maternity leave sincing giving birth to her second child Charles Max Feldman on December 8. But it looks like the mom of two will be back on TV even earlier than expected! Last week, Guthrie posted a photo of herself with baby Charles to Instagram, alongside a caption that read, \"Hey, little one, you're not the *only* good reason to wake up early!! ðŸ’•I'm headed back to @TODAYshow March 3! Excited to see you all!\" Aww! A post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie) on Feb 22, 2017 at 4:35am PST \nFast-forward to today, when Willie Geist announced on Sunday Today that Guthrie would actually get \"back in the big chair\" on Monday, February 27, according to People . Guthrie herself confirmed the news with this elated Instagram post, writing, \"Because I literally couldn't wait!!\" A post shared by Savannah Guthrie (@savannahguthrie) on Feb 26, 2017 at 6:37am PST \nIt's awesome that Guthrie, who is also mom to 2-year-old daughter Vale , is so pumped to dive right back into her exciting, fun-filled job. Fans haven't gone through complete Savannah withdrawal (she called in to talk about Charley's first Christmas and swung by on January 8 for a surprise appearance at Matt Lauerâ€˜s 20th anniversary celebration), but they'll surely be thrilled to see her every day. \nNot to mention that we can't wait to hear details of Charley and Guthrie's Today co-star Hoda Kotb's baby Haley Joy 's first playdate! Guthrie posted a sweet video, in which she's talking to her son about Kotb's daughter on February 21. They're bound to be BFFs.
