An investigation into St Andrew’s Health Centre in Northampton by Channel 4’s Dispatches also found children and adults are being prescribed potentially fatal antipsychotics. In the seven months between October 2010 and May 2011 there were four deaths of patients at the centre who were on one of these drugs. MPs have described the findings as shameful and say patients are being treated like ‘animals’ and ‘prisoners’. The centre is now being investigated by the Care Quality Commission watchdog. The revelations come six years after the Winterbourne View scandal at a centre for learning disabilities in Bristol. It was closed after the BBC’s Panorama exposed carers abusing young adults. The Government has repeatedly promised to close these large scale institutions and house adults and children in smaller residential care centres. But some 2,500 adults and children are still being looked after in institutions. St Andrew’s said patients’ safety and wellbeing was paramount and included protecting their confidentiality They include 660 patients at St Andrew’s where Dispatches was alerted to concerns. Fauzia Yasmin Hussain was admitted to the centre aged 15 four years ago and segregated in a small room for 22 months, because she was so difficult to control. CHILLING ECHO OF A BANNED TECHNIQUE The investigation’s findings have chilling echoes of the Pindown technique used in children’s homes in Staffordshire in the 1980s. Children would be deprived of their clothes and shoes and made to wear pyjamas to prevent them absconding. If they misbehaved they were isolated and locked in Pindown rooms for weeks or months on end, to the extent that some became suicidal. Many had behavioural problems which would now be diagnosed as autism or ADHD, but they were simply labelled as troublemakers. A public inquiry in 1991 banned the technique and recommended social services scrutinise the homes more closely. She was given powerful sedatives and began to lose weight, as staff were failing to ensure she had enough to eat. Former health minister Norman Lamb who visited her described her treatment as a scandal. He said: ‘I had heard very big concerns about the nature of the care in this institution. I saw Fauzia in her room, which in effect was a cell, it seemed to be that a 15-year-old girl was being treated in effect like a prisoner. ‘It was one of the most shocking things I’ve seen in my time in parliament. Just as a human being I was horrified. It was almost akin to treating her like an animal.’ Another patient, Matthew Garnett – who also has autism – was restrained and secluded 11 times in the first six months after being admitted in March 2016. St Andrew’s said patients’ safety and wellbeing was paramount and included protecting their confidentiality. A spokesman added: ‘This means that while we strongly refute the allegations made by Dispatches as false and misleading, we are unable to comment further.’ Under Lock and Key – Channel 4 Dispatches will be shown tomorrow at 10pm.
