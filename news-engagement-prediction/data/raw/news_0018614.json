Ramsey turned into Younes Kaboul’s freekick, which deflected off him and into the goal to set the tone for a week that may have ended any hope for Arsenal to win the Premier League.\n\"I think he bottled it a little bit; Ramsey’s mistake was our blessing,” said Deeney. “I have come up with Sean Dyche and Malky Mackay and if we had turned our back on the ball like that, they would have had strong words with us.”\nArsenal’s record goalscorer, Thierry Henry, believes that his old club are suffering from an issue of mentality but does not think that his old mentor, Arsene Wenger, should leave.\nArsenal are still currently in the top four ahead of last 16 ties in both the Champions League and FA Cup. “The work he has to do at the moment is difficult, because it is mental work,’ Henry told RMC Sport.\n“Personally, I do not think Arsene has to go. Does he have to change his tactics or his way of doing things? I do not know if he’s willing to do that. What I saw against Chelsea is a mental problem, and it’s not easy to manage. For now, something is missing\nWatford's Troy Deeney celebrates scoring their second goal at the Emirates “It’s been 12 years since Arsenal won the title and we feel this season they may not win it. I think there is quality in this team. But is there enough to win the title?\n“At the beginning of the season, when you look at Chelsea and Arsenal on paper, there is not a huge difference. So that means it’s possible. But for that, you have to be in tune with every day. I think Arsenal players are not aware of what they can achieve. At some point you have to believe in your chances of winning. It takes self-management and self-discipline in the group.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T04:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:24:07.188+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
