You likewise need to do a self-examination. You need to get it right too.” \nShe brought up his recent “last night in Sweden” misstep and his “reckless tweets” and the serious cost all of those things have, telling him it’s “dead wrong to rev up your loyal base with incorrect, generalized, and wide-sweeping inflammatory statements about the entire media.” \nWatch above, via MSNBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:29:27.204+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
