Mesut Ozil suffering CRISIS of confidence, admits Arsenal boss Wenger \nEriksen has been known to drill the ball under the wall this season and Coutinho was not going to see his side tricked by the same strike in the 2-0 victory. \nCoutinho can be seen dropping to one knee and stretching one leg across to ensure Eriksen could not sneak the ball under the wall and into the unguarded side of the goal. \nSimon Mignolet, positioned on the other side of the goal, would have be helpless to stop such a strike, but Coutinho made sure Eriksen could not take the low road. Eriksen’s route to goal under the wall was blocked by Coutinho (Picture: Getty) Coutinho guarded the side of the goal Simon Mignolet would not be able to get to (Picture: SkySports) \nEriksen curled his effort over the bar, but it seems the unusual method was picked up from a team-mate of Coutinho’s, Marcelo. \nThe Brazil defender has knelt down at free-kicks before and it seems as though Coutinho and Liverpool have taken note. Brazil international Marcelo adopted the same method against Argentina (Picture: Bein Sports) Lionel Messi stood over the free-kick for Argentina (Picture: Bein Sports) \nMarcelo dropped to the grass to defend a free-kick in Brazil’s 3-0 win over South American rivals Argentina in November. \nLionel Messi was the man standing over the ball in that game and smashed his effort into the wall. \nCoutinho started and scored in the same match and seems to have brought his international team-mate’s tricks back to Liverpool.
