No bail was listed. \nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department website said Faulkner was charged with a felony but no details were given. A sheriff's spokeswoman referred questions to airport police. \nAirport police officers weren't available for comment Thursday morning. Inside an $80 million energy scam: The SEC's story of Dallas' Breitling Energy \nNews of the arrest was first reported on the TXsharon's Bluedaze website run by Sharon Wilson, who was the first to publicly question Faulkner's background and qualifications . The environmentalist and activist website is critical of gas drilling and has focused particularly on exploration locally in the Barnett Shale. \nFaulkner's lawyer, Larry Friedman of Friedman & Feiger, was not immediately available for comment Thursday morning. Frack Master Chris Faulkner Arrested on Felony Charges - Texas Sharon's Bluedaze - https://t.co/oYWQNiGeHz via @Shareaholic #fracking â€” TXsharon (@TXsharon) February 21, 2017 \nThe federal Securities and Exchange Commission is suing Faulkner , the founder, president and CEO of Dallas-based Breitling Energy Corporation , along with seven other employees or associates. Breitling and three other related companies were also named in the complaint filed last summer. \nFriedman has previously said Faulkner did nothing wrong. \nFaulkner promoted himself, his \"Frack Master\" name and his company during dozens of cable TV appearances and at conferences from the United Arab Emirates to London. He was presented as a gas drilling expert and staunch defender of the industry against critics of hydraulic fracturing or fracking. \nHe had become such a go-to source that he was quoted as an expert in TheStreet.com more than a month after the SEC filed its complaint. \nThe federal civil complaint said Faulkner has little background in oil and gas and lied about his college degrees. The complaint also alleges that Faulkner and his employees inflated gas drilling costs and lied about likely production numbers. Ex-employee: 'Frack Master' in $80M SEC scam case 'never drilled a frickin' well in his life' \nThe SEC also accused Faulkner of misappropriating at least $30 million in investor money to \"maintain a lifestyle of decadence and debauchery.\" \nOne court document said Faulkner used a corporate American Express card -- which he referred to as his \"whore card\" -- to charge more than $1 million for strip clubs, escorts, nightclubs and personal travel. \nJeremy Wagers, Breitling's chief operating officer and general counsel, used his business card to charge $40,000 at a Dallas strip club during a four-day period in July 2014, according to court filings. \nThe SEC has accused the Breitling crew of more than a dozen violations of federal securities laws and rules.
