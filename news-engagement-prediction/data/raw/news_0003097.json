The Chad Stahelski-directed sequel — about Keanu Reeves’s dog-loving super-assassin — is primed to deliver the same brand of ultraviolent “gun-fu” as its superlative 2015 predecessor. Moreover, it’s set to be the first big-screen collaboration between Reeves and Laurence Fishburne since they both completed work on the Wachowskis’ Matrix trilogy 14 years ago. On Monday night at the movie’s premiere and afterparty, they further upped the reunion ante by meeting with another of their computer-overlord-fighting comrades. Neo. Trinity.

More Winter later tweeted his praise for Reeves’s new movie:\nThs new John Wick is better, louder & funnier than the first. Reminds me of the Death Wish movie I did, only with everyone in on the joke.\n— Alex Winter (@alxwinter) February 1, 2017 \n\n\nDirector Stahelski, meanwhile, confessed that he was still excited about having staged a big-screen get-together between Reeves and Fishburne, telling Variety , “I didn’t think we had a chance to get Laurence for this, but Keanu ran into him and said he loved John Wick. I’m still pinching myself.”\nMonday night’s reunion between the three Matrix stars will no doubt rekindle hopes that they’ll eventually find another project to work on, be it a future return to the Matrix universe or in a  John Wick 3 . For now, Moss remains busy with her work as attorney Jeri Hogarth in virtually every one of Marvel’s small-screen Netflix efforts, from Jessica Jones and Daredevil to the upcoming Iron Fist and The Defenders  — which, if the comics can be used as a guide, may have her working as legal counsel for New York’s mightiest superheroes.\nJohn Wick: Chapter 2 lands in theaters on Feb. 10.\nWatch our interview with Laurence Fishburne:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:27:37.146+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
