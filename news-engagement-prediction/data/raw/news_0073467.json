I submitted some, but I kind of felt like some of them didn’t really fit with vocals, because I mostly compose instrumental music, and I felt that’s they were just good for instrumentals, and I didn’t want to force it,” he explains. “But two or three days before I flew to Cairo, I thought of this melody while I was driving. I recorded a demo that day, really simple and stripped-down – just an idea of the feel of the song – and Maii instantly connected to it. And by the time I knew it, we were in the studio.” \nOnce the inevitable initial awkwardness of working with a virtual stranger had been overcome (“It’s a collaboration,” Ojeda says. “It’s really personal and it’s really intense”), the two quickly established a rapport – bouncing ideas for vocal melodies around. “I wanted her to connect to the song and deliver what she felt. It’s not like we’re sound designing – it’s not technical, it’s very emotional,” says Ojeda. “I’m a melody freak, right? If you do something that’s not true, you will hear it. You will feel it. So, I wanted that emotion there. We worked on [the melody] together, and it surpassed my expectations.” \nMost of the studio time in Cairo was spent recording different vocal takes, as Ojeda knew he could work on the instrumentation back in Dubai. Waleed came up with lyrics for the song (which is called “Nuqta”, meaning ‘Dot’) based on the theme of lost friendship – something Ojeda found it easy to connect with having grown up in Dubai. \n“Most of my friends here, we’ve been friends since elementary school, you know? Dubai was so small back then; everybody knew each other. But as you grow old, you see people leave and you don’t have any connection with them at all [any more]. It’s just weird. It’s very abstract, and very poetic, how she delivers that concept.” WATCH THIS VIDEO", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T17:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:49:43.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
