Zaka, however, rebutted by saying the cabinet has no authority to grant permission. \nThe hearing was then adjourned for six weeks. \nOn December 19, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif gave the administrative control of five autonomous regulatory bodies to related ministries. The decision was taken while disregarding strong opposition from the provincial governments of Sindh and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. \nIn July 2016, the IPC ministry had forwarded a summary to the prime minister seeking control of all subjects of the federal regulatory authorities. \nTransfer of powers: NEPRA autonomy to stay intact, govt tells PHC \nThe summary stated that since these authorities were under the cabinet, the ministry of information technology and telecom, and others, the IPC ministry was unable to efficiently coordinate with the provinces. \nUntil now, the regulatory bodies were under the administrative control of the cabinet division, or simply the prime minister.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:24:06.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
