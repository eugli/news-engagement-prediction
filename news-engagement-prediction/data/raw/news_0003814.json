These “empty homes” are typically second homes, or vacant properties which are either left empty or are awaiting for tenants or home owners to move in.\nThe Housing White Paper will target car parks near railway stations for new homes, reserve sites for new prefabricated homes which are quicker to build and allow taller homes to be built.\nTheresa May Credit: DARRIN ZAMMIT LUPI/DARRIN ZAMMIT LUPI I t is also expected to include measures to encourage smaller construction firms to break the stranglehold of the large housebuilders.\nHowever there will be no new threat to the Green Belt. One Government source said: “Protections for the Green Belt are the same as in the manifesto. There are no fears about the Green Belt.”\nThe White Paper – which is expected to be published on Tuesday – is expected to include new proposals to require developers to complete homes more quickly.\nCurrently builders lose planning permissions after three years unless work has started. However they can maintain planning permissions on sites simply by “digging a trench”, sources said. This means that more than 700,000 homes which have been granted planning permission since 2006 are yet to be built. \nUnder the new plans permission would be linked to the completion of homes by certain dates, rather than the starting of work.\nDevelopers could have to build quotas of homes by set deadlines as a condition of receiving the planning permission, or be let off paying for new local roads, bridges and community halls – so called Section 106 agreements – if they complete the new homes more quickly.\nUK housing surplus chart A report last year by Civitas, a thinktank, disclosed how developers and landowners used a controversial relaxation of planning rules in 2012 to hoard planning permits rather than build more homes.\nMore than two million planning permits were issued between 2006 and 2015 – a rate which would be enough to build average of 204,000 new homes a year but foundations were only laid on 1.3 million of them\nDaniel Bentley, editorial director at Civitas, said councils had approved more than 200,000 homes-a-year for the past four years, and yet last year there were still only 164,000 new-build completions.\nHe said: “This would be a really bold step by ministers and suggests they are not prepared to tiptoe around developers anymore - for too long planning permissions have been granted with no obligation to build.\n“This has meant that landowners and developers have been able to secure huge windfalls and then maximise their profits still further by drip-feeding new homes into the market at the highest prices they can.”\nCampaigners welcomed the plans. Rick Hebditch,a spokesman from the National Trust, said: \"There are positive signs that the Government has shifted away from blaming the planning system for housing problems. \n“People need homes but we need a well-resourced planning system to ensure they're good quality and in the right places.”\nShaun Spiers Credit: Tim Scrivener / Rex Features/Tim Scrivener / Rex Features S haun Spiers, chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: “Too few homes are being built, but this isn’t because of a failure of the planning system or a lack of land.\n“It is because the big builders would rather build slowly on greenfield land than build quickly on the many suitable brownfield sites across the country.\n“It is good that ministers understand this and are willing to put some pressure on developers to raise their game.”\nAlex Morton, a former Housing and Planning Adviser to David Cameron when he was Prime Minister, said: “Tory MPs and councillors get angry when they see permissions going up but housing starts rising slowly. If done this must be implemented sensitively.\"\nSajid Javid at last year's Tory party conference Credit: Joe Giddens/ Joe Giddens S teve Turner, a spokesman for the Home Builders’ Federation, said it was sensible to tie in the interests of the builders and local authorities when planning permission was granted.\nThis would stop local authorities granting planning permissions for too many homes on smaller sites to hit housing targets set by central Government.\nDavid Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, added: “We look forward to seeing more detail on this and welcome measures to speed up build-out rates in the private sector.\n“The sooner the homes the nation needs are built the better but this must not be at the expense of affordable housing.”\nA Communities and Local Government spokesman said: “We’ve been clear that house builders need to deliver more homes, and our White Paper due out shortly will set out clearly our plans to increase build out rates.”\nAt the Conservative party conference four months ago, Communities secretary Sajid Javid said he would take action to force big housing companies to build more homes more quickly.\nHe said: “The big developers must release their stranglehold on supply. It’s time to stop sitting on land banks and stop delaying build-out. The homebuyers must come first”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T00:20:07.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
