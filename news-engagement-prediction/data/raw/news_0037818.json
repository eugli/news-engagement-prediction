All students and staff were safe,\" the principal wrote in a letter that was sent home to parents. \"Police investigated and determined there was no public safety concern.\"\nThe post caused panic amongst parents, who said they were never notified about the online post by school staff.\n\"Our school and our school board take student safety very seriously.
