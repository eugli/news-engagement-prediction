The pace of change is also an issue for returned home electronics – with TV sets, tablets, laptops and other gadgets constantly replaced by upgraded new versions with extra bells and whistles. Items bought before February 1 will still be covered by the 90-day policy. The chain said it will tell customers about the change via receipts, parcels and at the point of sale. Its cut to 35 days brings John Lewis into line with Marks & Spencer. M&S cut its returns deadline from 90 to 35 days in 2009 in a move that triggered a backlash from customers. John Lewis is likely to suffer a similar response if customers are turned away at tills. A commenter on the Retail Week website described the change as a ‘very backward step’ and ‘total madness’. The change of policy brings John Lewis in line with Marks & Spencer, who already have a 35 day limit on returns Another wrote: ‘Senior management’s actions of reducing service standards and staff will in the end see a dilution of the [John Lewis] unique selling point that will result in further falling profits.’ Others insisted its returns policy was still much better than most retailers. One shopper said the main victims of the change will be people who re-sell John Lewis items on eBay and Amazon. On social media, he wrote: ‘They buy items in the sale. List them on Amazon then return them if the item hasn’t sold within the 90 days.’ Most high street stores offer a no-quibble return within 28 or 30 days. Under the law, shoppers have up to 30 days to return a product that is faulty in return for a full refund. If the fault occurs between 30 days and six months, the retailer is required to at least offer a repair or replacement. John Lewis claims customers will not miss the generous policy after its research found 85 per cent did not know about it. A spokesman said: ‘Our 35-day, no-quibble returns policy for unwanted items will be one of the best returns policies of all UK retailers. ‘Before we made the change, we asked our customers about our policy and found that over 85 per cent were unaware of our policy for unwanted items and over 90 per cent of customers who change their mind about a product bring it back within 35 days. ‘Today, our product ranges – particularly clothing – change much more frequently than they used to and bringing items back once products are out of stock can lead to disappointment.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T05:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:49:04.664+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
