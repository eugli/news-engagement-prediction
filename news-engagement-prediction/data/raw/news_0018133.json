There is a wonderful history of footballers hanging up their boots to pick up the mic, and Cisse and Drenthe will only be following in the footsteps of these hallowed recording artists…\nFormer France international Djibril Cisse will focus his attention on his new career as a DJ\nRoyston Drenthe, released by Baniyas in July, has recorded a new rap song called 'Paranoia'\nThe front cover for Ruud Gullitt's reggae single 'Not the Dancing Kind'\nRUUD GULLIT\nWhile at Feyenoord in 1984 Gullit made his first foray into music, releasing the reggae track ‘Not the Dancing Kind’. Despite the title of that track, Gullit was seen five years later grooving away and singing in the anti-apartheid protest song ‘South Africa’ by reggae band Revelation Time. This one hit the heights of No 3 in the Dutch pop charts, which is almost as surprising as his decision many years later to drop Alan Shearer for the Tyne-Wear derby.\nJESE RODRIGUEZ\nThe one-time Real Madrid wonderkid is now at Las Palmas after a failed spell at PSG. But if his football career never hits the heights expected of him, maybe an alternative career in rap awaits. His debut single, ‘Yo Sabia’, was released in 2015 under the artist name Jey M, and the video has been watched nearly 30million times on YouTube. Unsurprisingly, it features several flash cars, scantily-clad, writhing girls, bling, and some pretty awful singing from the man himself.\nANDY COLE\nSadly for the former Newcastle and Manchester United striker, the words to the terrace chant in his honour (he gets the ball/he scores a goal/it’s Andy, Andy Cole) are probably better than those penned for his rap single. Released in 1999, the same year as his magnificent treble with United, and produced by DJ Pied Piper (of ‘do you really like it, is it is it wicked’ fame), Cole’s lyrics in 'Outstanding' include this: I reminisce back to the school yard / I used to work hard, I used to play hard/ Got my kicks from hitting the net/ not from drugs, you bet. Somehow this reached No 68 in the UK chart.\nHODDLE AND WADDLE/ BOLI AND WADDLE\nWhen the remarkable slice of synth-pop ‘Diamond Lights’ was released in 1987, Glenn Hoddle and Chris Waddle were Spurs and England team-mates, so the modern equivalent might be Dele Alli and Harry Kane singing a folk duet. Despite Waddle’s somewhat lacklustre performance on Top of the Pops, his musical career continued with ‘We’ve Got A Feeling’, a funky, African-inspired rap with Marseille team-mate Basil Boli. By then Waddle had ditched the mullet and power chords for a pink shirt tucked into cream slacks, and possibly the most psychedelic video ever made. Check out the flying giraffes and Boli dressed as a Beefeater.\nGlenn Hoddle and Chris Waddle (right) performing 'Diamond Lights' on Top of the Pops\nDion Dublin playing his invention - the Dube\nDION DUBLIN\nYou may not be aware, but the presenter of the BBC’s Homes Under the Hammer used to play for Manchester United, Coventry and Aston Villa. But not only has Dublin mastered the worlds of football and home-improvement-based daytime TV, he is also a seriously talented musician. He plays the saxophone and drums, even once accompanying indie band Ocean Colour Scene on stage. But his greatest claim to fame is inventing his own musical instrument. The Dube is a sort of cubic drum played with the hands, and you can hear the man himself play it on the album ‘Dion Dublin’s Christmas Presents’.\nKEVIN KEEGAN\nThe high point to Kevin Keegan’s song ‘Head Over Heels in Love’, which reached No 10 in the German chart in 1979, sees the reigning European Player of the Year squeeze his eyes shut with emotion before letting out one final burst of the chorus. It’s his very own Westlife moment. What had looked like a bloke doing karaoke down his local working men’s club suddenly transforms into an epic love song. Yet, just when he was getting into it, this was sadly the end of Keegan’s music career.\nKevin Keegan sings his love song 'Head Over Heels in Love' during the height of his fame\nPAUL GASCOIGNE\nThere were signs in Gazza’s music career that all was not well elsewhere in his life. In Fog on the Tyne – which reached No 2 in the UK charts - he sings about sausage rolls, while the opening lyrics of ‘Geordie Boys’ pay homage to his hometown’s most famous alcoholic drink: ‘Newcastle town, there's Geordie Brown/ cheers to the lads who sup it down’. The Gazza Rap is a pumping tune inspired by the acid house generation, whose video features the star of Italia 90 dancing and flexing his muscles with alarming regularity.\nNOLBERTO SOLANO\nFormer St James’ Park favourite ‘Nobby’ Solano brought a flavour of South America to Newcastle both on and off the pitch, with his wing wizardry matched by his flair on the trumpet. The Peruvian formed a salsa band in England, which he called the ‘Geordie Latinos’. According to Solano, the 15-strong band, made up of a mixture of native South Americans and local Tynesiders were ‘lively and made everybody smile’ during their gigs playing latin jazz around the town.\nFormer Newcastle star Nolberto Solano was a trumpeter in his salsa band, the Geordie Latinos\nCLINT DEMPSEY\nThe former Tottenham and Fulham forward takes his hip-hop credentials so seriously that he prefers to be known by the name ‘Deuce’ among rap circles. The American’s 2006 track ‘Don’t Tread’, made with rappers XO and Big Hawk, was used by Nike in their promotion of the 2006 World Cup, and the video features Dempsey posturing, bopping and driving round in a convertible in stereotypical rap style. No-one has reported sightings of Dempsey doing the same along Fulham Broadway, however.\nALEXI LALAS\nThe U.S. defender who shot to fame during the 1994 World Cup always looked more like a roadie for Iron Maiden than a sportsman, so it should come as little surprise that he is perhaps the most prolific footballer-musician of all. The guitarist and vocalist has released three solo indie albums, notably ‘Ginger’ - presumably inspired by his distinctive long red hair and beard - and his band were even once a support act for Hootie and the Blowfish.\nVINNIE JONES\nThe most infamous member of Wimbledon’s Crazy Gang used his hard-man image to good effect in playing gangster Big Chris in Guy Ritchie’s Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but his music career never took off, despite singing ‘Big Bad Leroy Brown’ on Top of the Pops in 2002. The performance was most notable for Jones’s dance moves at the end, which he launches into with gusto. Jones’s cover version was never released as a single. Penny for John Fashanu’s thoughts…\nJOHN BARNES\nNo list of musical footballers could be complete without the man whose rap lights up the greatest World Cup song of all time. Barnes apparently landed the role in New Order’s anthem after beating Chris Waddle and Paul Gascoigne in a rap contest – probably not a battle you’ll see in a sequel to 8 Mile any time soon. Barnes’ effortless flow of Catch me if you can/ cos I’m an England man/ and what you’re looking at/ is the masterplan is only bettered by one of the best lines of all time: Arrivederci , it’s one-on-one…", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/s9WRZvLCalQ?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/M9UHcRrCWlI?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_YiG7yN7PY?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6Di8QT98Zk?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/3MnMskejuvc?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dU0-fmKI0lU?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Nz5F2aIWzw?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KEMMfV5-Qg?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ct5puqTSi0?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/jm6loGj-gY0?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/RhmJFOa4RgQ?feature=oembed"], "published": "2017-02-09T16:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:49:23.316+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
