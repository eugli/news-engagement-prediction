AP/File photo MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte will think “a thousand times” before deciding on whether to resume the peace talks with communists, which were terminated last month after rebels launched successive attacks against security forces. “I will think about it. I will think a thousand times and consult with the Cabinet, including the left-leaning members of the Cabinet,” the president told reporters in an interview Tuesday in Malacañang. “We are a Cabinet. We are a working government. We can work well with each other were all right and it's best that we discuss it some time, not now, about how to go on about this problem on how to navigate again the stormy waters of our country,” he added. Duterte stressed that the government’s interest “must prevail” in any negotiation. The president scrapped the peace talks between the government and the National Democratic Front (NDF) after the communists insisted on their demand to release 400 rebels whom they claim to be political prisoners. The NDF represented the communist rebels in the peace talks. Duterte opposed the demand, which he claimed, is similar to the grant of amnesty. The communists then called off its unilateral ceasefire and launched offensives against government forces. On February 4, Duterte announced that he is scrapping the peace talks and instructed the security forces to arrest the NDF consultants who participated in the negotiations. He has also labeled the NDF, the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and their armed wing the New People’s Army (NPA) as “terrorists.” The following week, the CPP ordered the NPA to release the six soldiers and policemen they are holding captive as a “positive gesture” for the resumption of the peace negotiations. The group also expressed support for a bilateral ceasefire agreement.
