(Source: PTI) \nAs the politically crucial Uttar Pradesh is all set to witness its fourth phase of Assembly elections, tight security arrangements are being made in 53 constituencies spread across 12 districts where the voting will take place on February 23. Districts going to polls in the fourth phase are Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Allahabad, Mahoba, Banda, Hamirpur, Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Chitrakoot and Fatehpur. Major parties to watch out for are Samajwadi Party (SP), Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ), Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). All these parties have put high stakes with an intention to form government with full majority. UP, over the past few months, has seen high decibel rallies and roadshows conduced by PM Narendra Modi , UP CM Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati. The ongoing polls are touted to be a litmus test for the SP government as the party has recently come out from a family feud. PM Modi-led BJP stands tall as one of the strongest competitors for the ruling party. On one hand, where Akhilesh has managed to build an image of ‘leader for youth’ and have gained a huge vote bank in various regions of the state, some blame him for the law-and-order failure in the state. \nBJP’s star campaigner, PM Modi, during his surged campaigning spree has constantly targeted the SP-Congress alliance and the BSP for corruption in their regime. \nMayawati-led BSP has cemented itself as one of lead contenders in this political run. However, the party is still behind in terms of vote bank apart from some particular communities. Even the votes of Muslim community have gone to her in limited areas where the candidates fielded are very strong. The high-octane assembly elections are in full swing in India’s most populous state and is expected to lay the cornerstone for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. While SP aims at retaining its power, this time with the Congress, both BJP and BSP are fighting to make a comeback. \nMirzapur is constituency No. 396 of Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly. It is situated in Mirzapur district in the eastern fringe of the state. It comes under the Mirzapur Lok Sabha constituency. It is an open constituency. \nNumber of voters As per the Election Commission data, Mirzapur has a total of 3,35,079 registered voters out of which 1,88,628 are male and 1,46,397 are female registered voters. There are 54 voters in the Others category. \nWhat are the key issues Pollution, poor roadways and development are main issues in this constituency. \nWho was the winner last time SP won the constituency by 22,299 votes during the 2012 Assembly elections. Kailash Nath Chaurasiya from SP bagged 69,099 votes followed by Rang Nath Mishra of BSP who got 46,800 votes. The voter turnout was 56.48 per cent. \nYou might also want to see this: \nWho are the competing candidates Kailash Chaurasiya (SP), Parvez Khan (BSP), Dinesh Prasad (RLD) and Ratnakar Mishra (BJP). \nWhy this constituency is important? People of this constituency are miffed with the ruling SP and its non-performance and this certainly gives a slight edge to the BJP and BSP. However, some people still believe that the other two parties are the same as when in power, these parties too did nothing. It will be interesting to see what change these electorates will bring.
