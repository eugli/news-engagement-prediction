Let's play Where's Wally? at 4,000m Credit: Tero Repo/Red Bull Content Hub Helen Coffey , travel writer 21 October 2016 • 3:08pm \nT his is possibly the most extreme version of \"Where's Wally?\" you'll ever play. Can you spot the skier in this picture of a terrifying, sheer 4,000m descent ? \nThe shot of freeskier Jeremie Heitz was recently shared by Red Bull, picturing him taking on a near-vertical peak in the Pennine Alps in Switzerland. \nThe 27-year-old Swiss skier made this insane drop back in May, but the pictures have only just been released. Where's Jeremie? We'll give you a hint Credit: Tero Repo/Red Bull Content Pool \nHeitz did the descent as part of a film project with Red Bull, in which he picked 15 of his dream peaks to ski down – this, apparently, was one of them. One man's terrifying is another man's exciting, it would seem. Watch: two freeriders tackle a terrifyingly steep ski line \nAfter skiing for the first time at the age of two, Heitz has since gone on to become a world-class freerider, and came ninth in this year's Freeride World Tour held in Verbier . \nHeitz's philosophy in life is to \"enjoy your time at 200 per cent\" – something he's clearly doing in this picture. \nFancy making spotting skiers on cliff faces your new hobby? Here are some more to get stuck into, courtesy of Red Bull. French freeskier Richard Permin is definitely in there somewhere...
