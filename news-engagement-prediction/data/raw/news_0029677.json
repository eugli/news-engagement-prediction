Usually that works, but if we didn't do that and still tried to find a way to get it out of the software, somehow, we would end up looking for a piece of software that is able to take those passwords already stored in your applications. Although it can be used in less-orthodox ways, Password Cracker brags about lending you a helping hand when you need to `see` behind those password asterisks. Its purpose is a noble one – get rid of those panic attacks when you realize you've lost or misplaced the registration code of your software. As long as your application has a filled-in password filed, Password Cracker should get the job done. This application is very small in size and it comes packed in an archive with no install process whatsoever. Just unpack and run it. The interface will pose some question marks as it isn't the cleanest piece of work. Besides that, there are just two buttons that will ask for your attention – `Enable` and `Options`. Accessing the options of the application will result in a drop-down menu with `Recover in IE` or `Recover in all windows`, `Top Most` or `Sound` features. Users may also select the appropriate language for the interface of the program from a variety of options. Password Cracker won't actually do miracles when it comes to reading passwords within the new versions of the most popular web browsers, that's for sure. Truth be told, it will only do that with a bunch of applications and Internet Explorer 7. The most noticeable of the supported software consists of Putty, Windows Live Writer, FTP Downloader and Total Commander. Password Cracker can run in tray mode as well, popping out every time it detects a new form. It's a silly way to do it because it will definitely drive you crazy in a matter of seconds. Bottom line is that Password Cracker will prove to be a good tool if you want to get passwords out of particular applications. It will provide the means to crack those password masks with no fuss, as long as you don't cross the line of supported programs.
