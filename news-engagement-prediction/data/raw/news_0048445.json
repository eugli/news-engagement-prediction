I want to enjoy life.\" \nCassidy was affected by his mother, grandmother and grandfather dying from the disease, noting it was particularly difficult to watch his mother \"disappear\" during the last years of her life. \n\"I feared I would end up that way,\" Cassidy said. \nCassidy announced his decision to retire at the beginning of February, citing arthritis making it more difficult to perform and travel. Last weekend, Cassidy played what he billed as the \"last two shows that I ever do on the west coast of the United States.\" \nCassidy's publicist said he will play at least two more shows before calling it a career -- at the Greenwich Odeum in Greenwich, Rhode Island , on March 3, and at B.B. King 's Blues Club in New York City on March 4.
