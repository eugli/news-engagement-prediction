Most congressional Republicans have been tugged into Mr. Trump’s thrall on border security, if they were not there already, with little outward complaint. At the party’s retreat in Philadelphia last month, lawmakers appeared primed to pay for a $12 billion to $15 billion border wall, although some estimates place the price tag billions higher. In some corners of the Republican Party, Mr. Trump’s victory has instilled in lawmakers and operatives a renewed sense of swagger, defying predictions that the party was doomed to perpetual presidential disappointment as white voters became a smaller share of the electorate over time. Over the long term, though, party strategists acknowledge that their problems with Hispanic voters have only deepened, as have their troubles with business leaders who rely on immigrant labor and remain committed to comprehensive immigration reform of the sort that died in Congress during the Obama years. Many Democrats agree, viewing Mr. Trump’s border push as a political loser that will energize the progressive base and entangle Republicans in a costly wall construction that the Mexican government, despite Mr. Trump’s longstanding pledge, is unlikely to fund.

As Mr. Ryan prepared on Wednesday to meet with officials at a Department of Homeland Security building in McAllen, Tex., protesters waited to greet him across a highway. “Keep the kids, deport the racists,” one sign read. Quickly, a chant broke out: “Puentes, no muros.” Bridges, not walls. Others expressed disappointment in Mr. Ryan, a politician they once viewed as moderate on immigration. “At one time, I did think he was going to work for us,” said Gloria Rodriguez, 60, of Harlingen, Tex., recalling Mr. Ryan’s criticisms of Mr. Trump last year. But behind her, across the highway, a truck driver had rolled down his window. “Donald Tr mp!” he shouted, turning his head back as he rolled. “Yea !” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Ryan’s office said little about his visit beforehand and declined for several days to confirm a report by The Monitor of McAllen last week about his visit here. By late afternoon on Wednesday, aides confirmed the basics of Mr. Ryan’s day: a helicopter tour, a horse patrol demonstration, the boat ride, a stop at a United States Customs and Border Protection operating hub, and a meeting with local leaders. “When you see with your own eyes the many challenges facing our law enforcement professionals along the border, it gives you even greater respect for the work that they do day in and day out,” Mr. Ryan said in a statement after the visit. “But more tools and more support are needed for them to do their jobs effectively. Congress is committed to securing the border and enforcing our laws, and together with the Trump administration, we will get this done.” Mr. Ryan was joined by three Republican colleagues, including Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. The speaker’s Twitter account capped the day with a photograph: Mr. Ryan in sunglasses and no tie, strapped into the helicopter, looking out on the Rio Grande Valley. Though Mr. Ryan has said he supports the same immigration policies as the White House, he has often sounded more inclusive than Mr. Trump. Confronted at a recent town-hall-style event on CNN by an undocumented immigrant protected from deportation under President Obama, Mr. Ryan sought to reassure her. “If you’re worried about, you know, some deportation force coming, knocking on your door this year, don’t worry about that,” he said.
