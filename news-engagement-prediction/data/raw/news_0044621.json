The news from Thumbay Hospital, Dubai, that a 63-year-old woman has given birth to a healthy baby through IVF has brought cheer to many childless couples in the UAE. Medical experts have, however, expressed reservations for IVF pregnancy after 60 using third party assistance, which is declared illegal in the country. Due to late marriages and growing number of divorce cases in the UAE and other Gulf countries, many aged women approach infertility clinics seeking help. But doctors have warned against IVF in older women which can cause ethical and health hazards for the mother. \"Having a baby is the greatest dream for me and my wife. For the last 16 years I have undergone treatment in various places and it has cost me around Rs1.5 million,\" said Abdul Hameed, an Indian manager at a fuel marketing company who is in his mid 40s. \"We have spent a lot of money and time on treatment. We haven't still given up hope. Our hopes go up when we hear news like this,\" Hameed added. According to sources at Thumbay Hospital, the 63-year-old woman gave birth on February 19, 2017 at 7.15am, making her a third-time mum after a year-long IVF treatment. \"Last year, the mother, a Sri Lankan and her Indian husband decided to start a family. They decided that IVF was the way out and approached a specialist in Chennai, India,\" the source said. \"The baby weighed 2.3kg at birth and is now doing perfectly well,\" said the hospital sources. The mother was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia (hypertension during pregnancy) and placenta previa (the condition when a baby's placenta partially or totally covers the opening in the mother's cervix). By the 36th week, there was bleeding which led an emergency caesarean session. Dr Gautam N Allahbadia, IVF Consultant and Medical Director, Aster IVF and Women Clinic, Dubai, said he is not in support of aged women getting pregnant using third party assisted reproduction. This is not permitted in several countries including the UAE, said Dr Allahbadia. \"Many patients come to us for IVF, and we do it only if they are below 45 years and have their own baby gentically.\" he said. \"Postmenopausal pregnancy using any form of third party assisted reproduction technology is not allowed in the UAE and many other countries,\" Dr Gautam added. \"It is allowed in India, but then again, there are no clear rules to regulate the IVF sector there. Soon the existing guidelines from the Indian Council of Medical Research will become law, and the new law will not allow the risk of pregnancy among aged women,\" he added. Dr Jaget Nirmala, Specialist, Obstetrics & Gynecology at Thumbay Hospitals said: \"Women who are healthy enough to have a baby in their later years should not be scared to do so. Childbearing at 63 years is extremely rare, but not a record. The patient and the baby have responded well and the couple took their newborn home on Tuesday. What is IVF? In Vitro Fertilization is an assisted reproductive technology commonly referred to as IVF. It is the process of fertilization by extracting eggs, retrieving a sperm sample, and manually combining an egg and sperm in a laboratory dish. The embryo(s) is then transferred to the uterus of the mother.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:55:36.259+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
