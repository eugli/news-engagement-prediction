The order restricts immigration from the seven Middle Eastern countries, suspends all refugee admission for 120 days, and blocks all Syrian refugees indefinitely. \nAccording to the retired four-star general, Trump’s attempts to solve a non-existent problem have actually created more serious security issues. \n“The jihadist narrative is that there’s undying enmity between Islam and … the West, Christianity, the crusader and so on,'” he said. \n“What we did this past week lifts their narrative. It is consistent with their story.” \nThat makes it harder for moderate Muslims to resist calls to extremism, and it makes it easier for groups like the so-called Islamic State to recruit new members. \n“There’s no one I know of my background, who’s actually done this for a living, who doesn’t agree,” said Hayden, noting that his goal is not to condemn the president. \n“It increases the odds that bad things will happen abroad and at home.” \nWatch the full interview with Gen. Michael Hayden on this Sunday’s West Block, airing on Global News at 11 a.m. ET. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
