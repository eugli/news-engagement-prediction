Martinelli 9:12 p.m. ET Feb. 22, 2017 \nMonster Energy is the new sponsor for the NASCAR Cup Series this season, and the Monster Energy Girls captured the internet's attention last weekend when they debuted days before the Daytona 500 on Sunday. \nSpecifically, their all-black outfits - which include knee-high boots and corset-style shirts - were declared inappropriate for the setting, and some would prefer them to wear fire suits instead of dressing like \"hookers\" on a \"family show.\" \nSo why the internet freakout? \n\"We live in a society where half of us think one way and half of us think another way - for the most part - about everything,\" 2010 Daytona 500 winner Jamie McMurray said at the Daytona International Speedway on Wednesday, noting he's not sure why the women's outfits caused such a stir. \n\"I'm not shocked at all that half the people didn't like something about that and that the other half did. And I think if you ask any question about anything, you get about a 50-50 answer right now in the world we live in.\" \nAs one person pointed out, women dressed similarly at sporting events, particularly NASCAR, is, as he put it, \"#NothingNew.\" For the special few who were disturbed by the Victory Lane attire of the Monster Energy girls today, I offer a history lesson. #NothingNew pic.twitter.com/jxhKy4hYOI â€” Dave Moody (@DGodfatherMoody) February 19, 2017 \nNo. 2 Team Penske driver Brad Keselowski offered another perspective. He acknowledged it's hard for people to see certain situations from others' points of view and said reactions to something like this are more reflective of the person reacting than of society overall. \nHis opinion has also strengthened since he had a baby girl less than two years ago. \n\"When you have kids and you start to see the world through their eyes because you're raising them, you see how much differently we all look at the world,\" Keselowski said. \"Because my daughter doesn't see a scantily clad model - she just sees another person who's wearing black or whatever colors or a lot of leather. She doesn't see sex appeal. She's a kid. \n\"So sometimes people say, 'What about the children?' No, it's more reflective of you seeing this as over-zealous than your kids because your kids have no idea, and that example could be applied in a number of other areas. I always feel like how you feel about situations like that is reflective of your own baggage, and it's not fair to apply it to others.\" Read or Share this story: http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/02/monster-energy-girls-inappropriate-clothing-nascar-cup-series-daytona-500-internet-outrage-social-media-daytona-international-speedway-brad-keselowski-jamie-mcmurray/ Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:38:52.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
