REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo By Aaron Sheldrick | TOKYO \nTOKYO U.S. oil prices fell on Friday after government data released late in the previous session showed stockpiles rose last week for a seventh straight week, although losses were muted as inventory growth was well below expectations. \nU.S. West Texas Intermediate CLc1 fell 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $54.33 a barrel by 0323 GMT (10:23 p.m. ET on Thursday), having closed up 1.6 percent in the previous session. It was on track for a weekly gain of about 1.8 percent, which would be its strongest so far this year. \nBrent crude LCOc1 was trading down 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $56.46. The contract rose 1.3 percent cents in the previous session to settle at $56.58, and was on track for a weekly gain of about 1.1 percent. \nU.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI rose by 564,000 barrels in the week to Feb. 17, up for a seventh week, although below analysts' expectations for an increase of 3.5 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. [EIA/S] \nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and producers including Russia have pledged to cut production by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to tackle a global glut that has kept prices depressed since 2014. \nWhile OPEC appears to be sticking to its deal, producers that were not part of the deal, particularly U.S. shale drillers, have increased output, driving the growth in inventories in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer. \n\"Current oil prices are neither sustainable for OPEC or the industry,\" AB Bernstein said in a note on Friday. \"As such, inventories will have to fall, which we expect will be clearer in the spring after the seasonal build.\" \nSigns are emerging that this is happening in Asia with traders selling oil held in tankers anchored off Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, Reuters reported on Friday. \nMore than 12 million barrels of oil has been taken out of storage in tankers berthed off Southeast Asian countries this month, shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows. \nTraders were benefiting from a market feature known as contango where prices for later delivery are higher than those for immediate dispatch. But the future premium is falling and future prices may slip below spot prices, known as backwardation. \n\"Tightening fundamentals will push the crude market into backwardation in the coming months,\" BMI Research said in a note. This \"will benefit participants in the paper market but hamper the profits of oil traders who are unable to exploit the cash and carry arbitrage.\" \n(Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Richard Pullin) Next In Commodities Iran says oil prices over $55 per barrel harmful for OPEC: Fars \nISTANBUL Iran said on Thursday an increase in oil prices to more than $55 per barrel was not in the interest of OPEC as it would lead to a rise in output by non-OPEC producers, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T10:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T07:09:49.508+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
