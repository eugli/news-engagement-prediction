Now, it's just as easy to figure out where to drink, rightthisveryminute. \nEnter Eater Philly's Cocktail Heatmap , your guide to the hottest drinking dens and restaurant bars of the moment serving up notable cocktails. Rather than featuring the perennial favorites, this list focuses on operations that have opened in about the last year, or have in some way transformed their bar program, and is updated regularly to keep things fresh. \nFor February, we say farewell to Restaurant Neuf , Martha , and Southwark , all of which have been open a while now. In their place, welcome the bookish Writer's Block Rehab , plush pub Harp & Crown , and St. Benjamin Taproom , courtesy of the brewery's new Bloody Mary program. \nNote that the points on the map are arranged from south to north, and aren't ranked.
