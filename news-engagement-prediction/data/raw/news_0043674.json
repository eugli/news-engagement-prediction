(Patrick Semansky/AP)   5:41PM EST \nCHESAPEAKE CITY, Md. - A telephone owned by Adolf Hitler has sold at auction for $243,000. \nAndreas Kornfeld of Alexander Historical Auctions says the phone sold Sunday afternoon to a person who bid by phone. The auction house does not disclose the names of buyers. \nBidding for the phone started at $100,000. \nThe red telephone includes a Nazi party symbol and Hitler's name engraved on the back. Occupying Russian officers gave the phone to a British officer, Sir Ralph Rayner, during a visit to Hitler's bunker in Berlin. The phone was used in vehicles and trains as well as Hitler's field headquarters. \nKornfeld says a porcelain figure of an Alsatian dog, also owned by Hitler, also sold Sunday to a different bidder for $24,300.
