Officials in many other areas say they'll let the mistakes go. They say there was widespread confusion among poll workers and voters.\nThe law requires voters to show one of seven approved forms of identification. It was softened in August to allow people without a driver's license or other photo ID to sign an affidavit declaring that they have an impediment to obtaining required identification", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T16:47:02.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
