Jill Hamilton \nDespite how every rom-com ever makes it look, no, just hopping on top during sex isn’t going to give you magical, spontaneous orgasms either. So, if clitoral stimulation is your jam, there are some adjustments you can make to your go-to positions that will definitely increase your ~satisfaction factor~. An extra hand or a toy down there can do wonders… Here, five perfect sex positions for enhanced clit stimulation: \n1 The Open Bar Cosmopolitan.com \nLots of women have their most reliable orgasms by leaning back and rubbing, circling, or tapping their clits. If this is you, then do that. Hop on a bar stool (or dresser or table) and spread your legs. The positioning gives you free rein to rub yourself as you please. This makes his thrusts inside you feel extra amazing, plus he gets to watch exactly how you like to be touched. \n2 Riding The Edge Cosmopolitan.com \nLie on your back with him flat on top of you, then straighten your legs and press them together with his legs on the outside. Roll your hips slowly and take… your… time. When one or both of you feels close, stop. Kiss, stroke his back, stare into his eyes, whatever stops the momentum. Repeat ’til you both are dying to finish — the point is to get so turned on that even if your clit is not being stroked in exactly the way you like it, orgasm is beyond inevitable. \n3 The Grinder Cosmopolitan.com \nIf you’re a grinder (folded blanket, wanton pillow, innocent Teddy Bear), try recreating the feeling with, like, an actual human lover by mounting your dude, facing his feet and pressing your vulvic zone onto his leg. Both of you can thrust, while you rub against his leg. Is it getting hotter in here? \n4 Electric Cowgirl Cosmopolitan.com \nStandard cowgirl is great, but if you’ve tried this and… nothing, you’re going to need to bring in reinforcements. For analogue boosters, lean down and rub against his pubic bone, or have him rub a wet thumb across your clit. For more super-charged results, have him wear a cock ring that vibrates for you. It’ll also keep him hard as hell (also for you!). \n5 Tunnel of Love Cosmopolitan.com \nAssume the doggy style position, but instead of a straight-on pounding, have him slide his penis under you and across your clit. Lube up your hand and cup it around his penis to create sort of a makeshift vag/hand job thing, and he’ll be more than happy to service you this way. \nJill Hamilton writes the blog In Bed With Married Women . \nThis article originally appeared on Cosmopolitan.com .
