Sources of income \nAdam Corlett, Economic Analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: \"The main driver of pensioner income growth has been the arrival of successive new waves of pensioners, who are more likely to work, own their home and have generous private pension wealth than any previous generation. \n\"Of course, not all pensioners can draw on these income sources, which is why the state pension will always be the main income for many pensioners. Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Future generations of pensioners may not enjoy the same income as the current wave of retirees \n\"We can't assume either that young people today will be able to draw upon the kind of wealth that recent pensioners have accumulated, given the recent fall in home ownership and decline in generous defined benefit schemes.\" \nThe report identifies four key drivers of growth in typical pensioner incomes since the 2000s. \nThese are: the possession of occupational pensions, a growth in the numbers in employment, increased state benefits, and a move towards home ownership from renting. \nBut the Resolution Foundation warns that future generations of pensioners cannot assume that they will benefit from further gains from these income sources.
