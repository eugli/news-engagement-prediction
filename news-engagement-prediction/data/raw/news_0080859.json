No infrastructure bill, no health care fix, no tax reforms—just a bunch of nasty schoolyard jabs at easy targets. Madeline Conway writes : \nSpeaking to ABC’s George Stephanopoulos on “This Week,” Pelosi accused Trump of talking about what she argued were less pressing issues — namely, his attacks on the press and immigrants and his administration’s stance on what bathrooms transgender schoolchildren should use — to avoid drawing attention to the fact that he has not yet introduced a jobs bill. [...] \n“I call him the deflector in chief,” said the California Democrat. “He has no jobs bill, so he has got to talk about the press. He has no jobs bill, so he has to talk about kids, transgender kids in school. He has no jobs bill, so he has to talk about immigrants and have a ban on Muslims\" entering the United States. [...] \n“All this is a deflection from the fact that he has done nothing,” Pelosi concluded. \nIndeed, Trump's accomplished very little of his first \"100-day\" agenda. And anyone who actually voted for him with dollar signs in their eyes has gotten little more than a pocket full of “anti” initiatives: anti-Muslim, anti-immigrant, anti-LGBTQ, topped off with an explosion of anti-Semitism throughout the country. \n#MAGA", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:09:33.034+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
