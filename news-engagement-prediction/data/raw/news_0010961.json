For me, there were a whole lot of things I put into consideration. I noticed a whole lot of people were trying to hijack the process. \n“I only decided to back out of the physical protest due to security reasons but it’s not as if I’m not still standing by the things I said or the things I believe about governance in Nigeria for a long time now. \n“I want to make it clear, I was not arrested by the DSS, I am free, I am good, nobody intimated me, nobody harassed me, nobody paid me to start it in the first place and nobody paid me to stop it. \n“I didn’t stop the protest I only stopped the physical convergence”. \nThe singer had started a movement “One Voice Nigeria”, and had planned to embark on the protest over what was termed “obnoxious policies” of the Federal Government, come February 6, 2017. \nAs at Sunday, he had denounced plans to go ahead with the protest after intense pressure was mounted on the group from the police as a result of security threats.
