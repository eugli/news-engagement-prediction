Kim Kardashian West Pairs a Corset with Sweat Pants February 23, 2017 3:00 PM by Edward Barsamian Photo: AKM-GSI It’s been a minute since we’ve last seen Kim Kardashian West in a corset but yesterday while filming with mom Kris Jenner and sister Kourtney , the fashion plate of the family proved the power of the Victorian-era staple with a pair of lo-fi sweatpants. What set Kardashian West’s look apart from her recent outings in track suits and statement coats was the marriage between high fashion and comfy style. Kardashian West stuck with her signature monochromatic palette but drained the color from her look to highlight the details. A snow white puffer, a jacket recently sported by model sis Kendall , topped off the look with a sporty twist while a lace-embroidered corset top added feminine flair. Offsetting the preciousness, and amping up the athletic influences, were tonal sweat pants which benefited from coordinating Yeezy boots for a leg-lengthening effect. Bringing in a cheery pop were vintage Escada sunglasses from Open for Vintage and an Hermès Kelly pochette for 1980s inspired opulence.
