February 05, 2017 Leave a comment \nPhillip Schofield just showed off his dabbing skills! The This Morning presenter performed the popular dance move at his home. In a video posted on his Instagram account, the dad-of-two prepares to try out the dance move while clad in pyjamas, joking: \"It has to be slick, quick and effective.\" He then quickly dabs before picking up his glass of red wine and walking swiftly into the next room. The star and the person filming can be heard trying to keep themselves from laughing, and fans have been quick to join in on the fun. One commented on the video: \"Isn't he the best man ever,\" while another added: \"This just made my day.\" A video posted by Phillip Schofield (@schofe) on Feb 5, 2017 at 2:57am PST \nThe 54-year-old, who aptly captioned the clip simply \"#schofedab\", regularly takes to Instagram to give his followers an insight into his life, and recently posted a group photo of his family in honour of his daughter Ruby's 18th birthday . In the sweet snap, Phillip can be spotted smiling from behind the sofa as his two daughters, Ruby and Molly, sit on the sofa with other family members. The television personality also shared several behind-the-scenes photos of his time at the National Television Awards in January, including one of his co-presenter and close friend Holly Willoughby, writing: \"She's on her way.\" A photo posted by Phillip Schofield (@schofe) on Jan 21, 2017 at 12:51pm PST \nREAD: National Television Awards 2017: Complete winners list \nAfter winning the award for Best Live Magazine Show at the ceremony, Phillip promised that the pair would be matching tattoos. However, he ended up backtracking the next day , explaining to This Morning viewers: \"Last night we did make a few rash promises... I've got to tell you, we so, so nearly did!\" Holly interjected: \"It was very close and there were a number of reasons why we are not sporting tattoos this morning. And it was more to do with the practicalities, and you can't get a tattoo if you've had a drink.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T15:59:22.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
