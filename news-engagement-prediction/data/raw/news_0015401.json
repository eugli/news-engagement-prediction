It speaks volumes. \n“The polling data shows that 82 per cent of Scots voters who expressed an opinion dismiss the EU as a political gravy train.” \nHe said analysis of the survey showed the opinion was shared “across the board”. GETTY The top five issues for most Scottish voters were the NHS, law and order, education and immigration \nOf the voters who backed Scottish independence in 2014, only 16 per cent did not agree with the EU gravy train sentiment while 36 per cent of Remainers agreed with the statement. \nMr Brown added: “Given the reality in Scotland, it is fairly obvious why Nicola Sturgeon is so keen to draw public attention away from what is important to the public, and focus attention on what is important to Nicola Sturgeon – Brexit and the next independence referendum. \n“The SNP were elected on a platform of change in 2007. The fact is, however, under the SNP things have only been changing for the worse.” \nThe First Minister has threatened to call a second independence referendum unless the UK Government accepts her blueprint for Scotland to remain in the European single market with the rest of the UK out. \nHowever, opposition parties have been quick to remind the SNP leader that officials figures show the UK market is more lucrative to the nation than the EU, saying she should rule out a second vote without delay. \nRoss Thomson, Scottish Conservative MSP for the North East Region, said: “These results should send a clear message to the SNP that the views of Scots on the EU are not so different from those elsewhere in the UK. The idea that all voters north of the border are in thrall to Europe is absurd. \n“The SNP have tried to airbrush the one million Leave voters – including hundreds of thousands of Yes supporters – from history as they use the Brexit result to push for separation. \n“This poll also strongly suggests that the SNP should be focusing on the day job – dealing with our struggling NHS, underperforming education system and sluggish economy.” \nScottish Labour said that, while it did not agree with the UK leaving Europe, the situation would be made worse by Scotland leaving the UK. GETTY Every age and socio-economic group felt the EU was irrelevant to their lives \nA spokesmen added: “That’s why Labour will not support any SNP plan to impose another independence referendum on the people of Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon should just rule out another independence referendum altogether.” \nBut an SNP spokesman dismissed the poll and said: “The Tory threat of a hard Brexit means the UK economy is in danger of hitting the buffers. \n“Meanwhile, it’s clear that Mr Brown’s arguments have run out of steam. \n“Every constituency in Scotland voted to remain part of the EU, sending a clear signal voters believe our future is in Europe. \n“The SNP will fight to ensure their voice is heard.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:04:24.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
