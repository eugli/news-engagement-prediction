Trump, among other things,deniedaccess to the US forpeoplefrom Iran, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, and is still keen on the whole \"building a wall alongthe entire US border with Mexico\"thing.\nBorder walls aren't a foreign concept to Europeans.The last one wasn't demolished in 1989; there's still onebetween Spain and Morocco, for instance,and one in Greece. And overthe last few yearsthousands of migrants have diedtrying to get into Europe.I spoke toDavid Bondia, Professor of PublicInternationalLawat the University of Barcelona, who believes Europe and the United States are\"just equally mean\" in theirimmigrationpolicies.\nVICE: How doEuropean and USimmigration polices differ?\nDavid Bondia: Well, they're more or less the same. The way they go about it is a bit different. Trump signed hisexecutive order in the heat of the moment, and he has the executive power to do so. In Europe, decisions like that have to pass through national parliaments.But the result is basically the same.\nSo is there any policy in Europe comparable to what Trump did last weekend?\nI think so, yes. Many anti-terrorism lawsaremostlyused to undercutfundamental human rights and people's privacy under the guise of security. And so many laws concerning immigrationseem to suggest that humanrights are privilegesand can becommodified.\nCan you give an example?\nOne exampleinvolves a number of European countriesdenying immigrantsaccess to public health care.That's a violation of thehuman right to health care, but it has beena reality in many European countries for years. In Spain in 2012, for example, a right-wing party approvedaroyal decree that excludes anyone who isn't registered in the public healthcare system from health care. They'll eventually have to deal with theEuropean Court of Human Rights, but that's not a real threat to many national politicians in Europe.\nBut they're democratically elected officials aren't they just doing what the public wants?\nI don't think so.The European right-wing as well as the American doesn't have that much support in absolute terms, if you take into accountall the people who haven't voted and have voted against them.Socially speaking, just a small percentage of the populationagrees with thosedeeply right-wing speeches. Idon't justmeanTrump, but also Marine Le Pen in France or Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, for example. I don't think it'sa majority of the people, but they all voteand that's what makes their opinion weigh so much on a national scale.\nAnd immigrants in both Europe and the US aren't allowed to vote.\nExactly whilethese are people who work, pay taxes and contribute to our countries, sometimes for decades. That's the case in allEuropean countries except Scandinavia. In Denmark,if immigrants can vote in the country where they came from, they can do it in Denmark in local elections.\nHow can countries just bypass international treaties?\nMostimmigration laws in European countries bypass international treaties, and countries are yet to be reprimanded for it. One of the mostpainful examplesis the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families , adopted by theUnited Nations in 1990. It's great it protects the rights of migrant workers in their country oforiginand in the country of their destination. It even guarantees certain benefits if the worker decides to return to his or her country of origin. Do you know how many Western countries ratifiedit?\nHow many?\nZero . Not just European countries, but also theUS, Australia and many other developed countries.It was mostlypassed by the countries of origin of those immigrants, so to speak.It's funny Spain considered approving itin 2008, in the midst of the crisis, when many Spanish workers had to go abroad to find a job.\nBut at least we haven'tbanned people from seven Muslim-majority countries under the guise of \"national security\". Can we take somecomfort in that?\nWe have a visa policy [in Spain]that can be extremely random. What's a littlebetter hereis thatif you're an immigrant and you'redenied a visa for a countryyou'll mostly be denied access as a person, instead of just because you're a citizen of a certain country.But the basis on which you can be denied a visa can still be very perverse.\nWhat would happen if we followed Trump's example with this executive order?\nIt would be a disaster. Trump has banned people from countries that the US has no real trade interest with.That would be difficultin Europe, because we have more profitable trade relations withthose countries.It really is absurd that we want access to African resources, but don't allow them to do the same here.\nSo now what, professor?\nWell, that's an easy one, if you ask me.All this nonsense, these policies that are a straight violation of human rights, should mobilisea global movement of civil resistance. And we need to change our language it shouldn't be about one group of people tolerating the other, it should be about everybody co-existing together.\nMore on VICE: \nWhat It's Like to Grow Up as an Unwelcome Immigrant \nYoung Immigrants in America Are Still Bracing for the Possibility of Deportation \nThe Undocumented American Immigrants Trying to Get Sent to Detention", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:46:48.198+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
