I started this by appointing an African woman as the Fifa secretary General in Fatma Samoura,\" said Infantino whilst addressing football stakeholders in Kampala. \n\"Africa has the talent and passion for the game of football and this is a very big advantage,\" Infantino added. \nOn Friday night, Infantino met the Uganda President, Yoweri Museveni at State House, and then met Uganda FA delegates on Saturday. \nHe later watched an Under-17 game between KCCA FC and Lweza FC before heading to Rubaga to open a new sports training facility. \nInfantino promised that more investment would be made in Africa by Fifa whilst he is in office, starting from this year. \n\"Africa will see the benefits of football development from Fifa and I hope we can have a world champion from this continent,\" he said. \nThe Fifa president also reiterated his stance that he has no influence on next month's Confederation of African Football presidential elections which will be held in Ethiopia. \nThe Uganda FA President thanked Infantino for travelling to Uganda and asked him to come again in the future to see further football development. \nThe Fifa boss later travelled to Kigali, Rwanda where he was expected to launch a football development project.
