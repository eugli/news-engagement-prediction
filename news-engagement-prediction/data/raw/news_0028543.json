Not everyone on the Cubs' roster will be asked to play three different positions in one game, which Kris Bryant did twice, but being able to play more than one spot could help in determining who will make the final 25. Expect to see Ben Zobrist return to his super utility role, moving from second to the outfield. The Cubs will have a new position player in camp,   , who has been rehabbing in Arizona since the end of November. \nWho will make the final 25? Here's a breakdown as the Cubs prepare to open camp. \nCatchers: Willson Contreras , Miguel Montero \nWhen the Cubs promoted Contreras in mid-June, they decided to carry three catchers for the rest of the season. It worked, as Contreras was able to play left field and got on-the-job training behind the plate. He'll be the regular catcher and continue to get lessons from Montero, 33, who started 64 games, his lowest total since 2008. Pitchers compiled a 3.18 ERA when Montero was catching and, according to Statcast™ , he led Cubs catchers with the highest number of pitches outside of the strike zone that were called strikes (545 pitches out of 8,723). Contreras' role set to expand Muskat on Contreras' role with the Cubs in 2017 Carrie Muskat breaks down the expanded role Willson Contreras will have with the Cubs during the 2017 season \nFirst base: Anthony Rizzo \nThis is Rizzo's job. Period. Now the longest-tenured Cubs player, Rizzo, 27, is coming off his first National League Gold Glove Award, first NL Silver Slugger Award, and you can expect more acrobatic catches. He finished fourth in the NL Most Valuable Player Award voting, behind Bryant, and he paced the team with a .341 batting average with runners in scoring position. If Rizzo needs a breather, Bryant or Javier Baez can sub. Outlook: Rizzo, 1B, CHC Outlook: Rizzo is a perennial MVP award contender Anthony Rizzo is coming off arguably his best season at the dish and registered his third consecutive 30-homer campaign and a .292 average \nSecond base: Baez, Zobrist \nBaez and Zobrist are projected to share second. Baez batted .318 and provided one highlight reel play after another during the NL Championship Series, sharing MVP honors with pitcher Jon Lester . Zobrist, 35, may have started in the outfield during the postseason, but Maddon likes the veteran's presence in the infield as well. Baez's magical October Baez putting on impressive show throughout postseason Javier Baez has been one of this postseason's brightest stars with his dynamic play, including earning co-MVP honors for the 2016 NLCS \nThird base: Bryant \nAfter being named Minor League Player of the Year in 2014, Rookie of the Year in '15 and NL MVP last season, Bryant may be aiming for an NL Gold Glove. It's one of the few trophies he doesn't have. The 25-year-old is coming off a spectacular season and has said he's working on hitting the ball more to right field. Look out, NL pitchers. Outlook: Bryant, 3B, CHC Outlook: Bryant looks to build on MVP season Kris Bryant secured NL MVP honors in 2016 and should enjoy another fantastic campaign from a premium spot in the Cubs' loaded lineup \nShortstop: Addison Russell \nRussell turned 23 on Jan. 23. He's so young. In his second season, he set career highs in home runs (21) and RBIs (95), nearly giving the Cubs three players with 100-RBIs seasons. Russell is still learning. The Cubs would like to see him improve on his .238 batting average (he did post a .301 clip in the Minors). But because of how well he plays defense and the fact that he ranked second on the team with RBIs with runners in scoring position (74), the Cubs are very happy with Russell's performance. Baez can back him up. Must C: Russell's six-RBI Game 6 Must C Classic: Russell ties WS record with six RBIs Addison Russell ties a World Series record with six RBIs by hitting a two-run double and a grand slam \nUtility: Matt Szczur , Tommy La Stella \nSzczur is versatile, well-liked by his teammates for his generosity (he loaned his bat to Rizzo during the postseason and his underwear to Russell) and out of options. Whether he makes the final 25-man roster could come down to whether the Cubs want to carry an extra infielder like La Stella or an outfielder. IT on Szczur, Cubs' bats IT on Szczur helping the Cubs out of their slump Kevin Millar and Chris Rose talk about Matt Szczur helping the Cubs' offense break out of its slump in the NLCS \nOutfield: Schwarber, Albert Almora Jr. , Jon Jay , Jason Heyward \nSchwarber is back after tearing two ligaments in his left knee in the third game of the regular season, and he is projected in left field, while Almora and Jay will share center, and NL Gold Glove Award winner Heyward is in right. Expect the Cubs to be careful with the number of games Schwarber plays so as not to aggravate his knee. Zobrist can start in the outfield, and Maddon may move Bryant out there as well. Schwarber's huge role in 2017 No matter where he hits, Schwarber will have impact MLB.com's Carrie Muskat talks about Kyle Schwarber returning to the lineup and possibly batting leadoff being a difference maker in 2017 \nStarting pitching: Lester, Jake   John Lackey , Brett Anderson \nFour-fifths of the Cubs' stellar rotation from last season returns in Lester, Hendricks, Arrieta and Lackey. Anderson, a free agent who signed in late January, is coming off back surgery, which limited him to four games last season. His longest outing was five innings on Sept. 22. If Anderson is not ready,   can start. Anderson strikes out Arenado COL@LAD: Anderson caps off 1-2-3 inning with a K Brett Anderson gets Nolan Arenado to strike out swinging, putting a cap on a 1-2-3 top of the 1st inning \nBullpen: Wade Davis , Hector Rondon , Pedro Strop , Carl Edwards Jr. , Justin Grimm , Koji Uehara , Caleb Smith , Montgomery \nThis is the one area that will undergo the most change for the defending champs. The Cubs have hinted that they will carry 13 pitchers because of how Maddon likes to use his bullpen. Davis is the new closer but a familiar face to Maddon because of their time together in Tampa Bay. Will Will Smith , a Rule 5 Draft pick, stick? Settling on the right combination will be the main focus in Spring Training. Montgomery may stay in bullpen Muskat on how Anderson affects Montgomery's role   discusses how the signing of Brett Anderson will affect Mike Montgomery's role  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T04:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T02:35:19.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
