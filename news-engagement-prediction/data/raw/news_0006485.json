After being cleared of a doping charge by UEFA, it was thought that he would find his way back into the fold, but the German boss made it quite clear, months ago, that there was no place in the side for Sakho.\nSeveral clubs had been alerted by the possibility of signing the 26-year-old, but according to the  ​Telegraph's Matt Law , it's Palace who have won the race. Unwilling to pay the £20m that the Reds are demanding, they have opted to sign Sakho on a loan deal instead.\n\nThey have come to an agreement with the player, but have yet to agree on the move itself with Liverpool.\n\nLiverpool fans are quite unhappy with Klopp's pricing Sakho out of a move, though, and have reacted quite angrily over social media as they believe that the club is ruining the player's career.\nKlopp is ruining Sakho's career, who's gonna pay £20 mil for someone who hasn't played first team in a year\n— a.
