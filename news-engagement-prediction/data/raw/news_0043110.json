PUBLISHED: 08:34, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 | UPDATED: 08:53, Tue, Feb 21, 2017 ARCHANT Harold lied about his age to get into the Navy at age just 14 \nHarold Lock signed up to fight for King and Country in 1937 when the RN was still the world's most powerful navy after he lied about his age. \nWar clouds were already gathering over Europe as Adolf Hitler armed Germany to the teeth. \nThe Second World War broke out in September 1939 when the Germans invaded Poland as patriotic boy seaman Mr Lock did his training at HMS Ganges in Shotley, near Ipswich, Suffolk.

ARCHANT Mr Lock was kept in a Japanese PoW camp for three years during the war \nMr Lock managed to swim eight miles through shark-infested waters in a desperate bid to survive and escape. Death had become commonplace and we were getting like robots Harold Lock in The Forgotten Men \nBut the exhausted sea salt was captured by Japanese soldiers as soon as he set foot on dry land. \nMr Lock, from Sudbury, Suffolk, was locked up in a notoriously brutal PoW camp on the Indonesian island of Java and spent the rest of the war working as part of a hard labour gang. \nHe toiled alongside thousands of fellow Allied prisoners building an airstrip on a tropical island, which the Japanese intended to use as a staging post for invading Australia.
