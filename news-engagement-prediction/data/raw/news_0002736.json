At its best, it allows for black Twitter, black culture makers and everyday African-Americans to revel in the genius and creativity of our people. But at its worst , it allows blatantly bigoted conservatives (and more insidiously, anti-black liberals) a get-out-of-jail card to say: “Hey, I’m not racist! I love me some peanuts and George Washington Carver !” \nTrump didn’t even meet the low bar for the latter, though. Just like he did in front of the CIA’s memorial wall, Trump centered the message on himself, speaking about black history ostensibly to black people more lazily than when he talked about “Two Corinthians” to Christians. \nThis is no surprise from someone who doesn’t like to read , is not fond of history showing he was sued for housing discrimination, and won’t apologize for calling for the execution of the Central Park 5 years after they were exonerated. \nBut Trump and his puppet master, Steve Bannon, didn’t even try to look interested today. When Trump said that “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I noticed,” I couldn’t help but wonder: was he referring to the enormous banner which greeted him on his empty inaugural parade which had Douglass’s face and bore his famous quote , “Power concedes nothing without demand. It never did, and it never will”? \nAt least Trump mentioned some black people in his speech (unlike when he failed to mention enslaved black people or Jews on Holocaust Remembrance Day). Many white supremacists try to sugarcoat their racism by talking about Martin Luther King this month. \nGranted, they reference a cartoon version of King who is reduced to a few words in one speech and who is devoid of any of his economic or anti-racist militancy. Still, Trump couldn’t even manage to engage this beloved King caricature, but could only talk about the dumb bust of his head which has been the source of one stupid non-controversy after another . \nPerhaps most scarily, Trump used the speech to begin to articulate how he is going to further harm African Americans. First, he vaguely said “we need better schools and we need them soon.” This would be empty pabulum, except it was a threat before he tries to hand our schools over to Betsy DeVos , a woman content to leave special needs students at the mercy of inconsistent state laws and a disastrous record of educational privatization which will hurt black children. \nAnd while Trump’s promise that “we’re gonna work hard on the inner city,” and that Ben Carson “is gonna be doing that, big league,” sounds condescending and laughable, it’s actually frightening. Ben Carson has shown disregard for public assistance programs, admitted he wasn’t qualified to lead any federal agency, let alone one responsible for keeping already marginalized people from homelessness. \nAnd Trump’s plans for “inner cities” often involve aggressive threats to “send in the feds.” He doesn’t seem to view cities as anything other than places of crime that need more police. “We need safer communities and we’re going to do that with law enforcement”, he said. \nSafer communities come from a more fair sharing of resources, education, opportunity and access to the tools of living, not from regressive policing. But we’ll see little of the former and much more of the latter in the new administration. \nIf Trump really wanted to know what black Americans are seeking from him, the Twitter addict would host a Twitter town hall. But he wants to control, not listen, to Black America, and he can barely be bothered to show any interest. \nTrump’s Black History Month speech didn’t harm African Americans and black people worldwide as much as his actions already have, including his immigration ban, the global gag rule, and his rollbacks on Aids and healthcare. But the speech portends that more harmful actions are coming – and they start now. African Americans already got the shortest month of the year for our history, and now it’s about to get Trumped.
