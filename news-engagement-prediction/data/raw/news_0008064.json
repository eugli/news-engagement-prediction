Attorneys for Disney and employees submitted a court filing Tuesday seeking approval of their settlement. \nComcast Corp.’s Blue Sky Studios reached accords totaling $19 million. \nApple Inc., Google, Intel Corp. and Adobe Systems Inc. paid $415 million in 2015 to resolve their part in a similar case that was brought against a group of Silicon Valley technology companies that had been investigated for collusion by the U.S.Justice Department. \nThe studios case is Nitsch v.
