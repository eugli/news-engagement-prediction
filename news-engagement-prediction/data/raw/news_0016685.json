The two automakers are investing $85 million to mass produce the tech that will power hydrogen cars starting in 2020. Not many people are familiar with hydrogen-powered cars, and from an infrastructure standpoint, purely electric vehicles make more sense. Here's a look at all the hydrogen-powered cars in the works: 1/11 Honda Clarity Honda began leasing Clarity in California at the end of 2016. The EPA recently gave the car an estimated range of 366 miles â€” the longest range of any zero-emissions vehicle. Honda says the Clarity has a refuel time of just three to five minutes. 2/11 General Motors General Motors revealed its monster of a hydrogen-powered car at the at the fall meeting of the Association of the United States Army in October. The car comes with 37-inch tires and stands at more than 6.5-feet tall and 7-feet wide. The US Army will test the car in extreme conditions in 2017 to determine whether it's viable for missions. GM says it has achieved 3.1 million miles of hydrogen fuel cell testing. 3/11 Toyota Mirai Toyota has been working on hydrogen-powered cars the longest, having put 23 years into the technology. Here we see its hydrogen car, the Toyota Mirai. The Toyota Mirai has an EPA estimated range of 312 miles and refuels in just 5 minutes. The Mirai comes with a front radar sensor and camera that allows it to detect lane drift and alert the driver. It also comes with automatic emergency braking. The car comes with two touchscreens. The top one can be used for music selection and navigation, while the one on the bottom controls the temperature and audio output. 4/11 Lexus Lexus wants to unveil its hydrogen-powered car in 2020. The car comes with high-tech perks like a display that can be controlled with simple hand gestures. 5/11 Audi Audi unveiled a concept car, the h-tron quattro, at the 2016 Detroit Auto Show that the automaker says can drive 372 miles on hydrogen alone. Audi says the mustard yellow, fuel cell car can go from 0 to 62 miles per hour in under 7.1 seconds. The h-tron quattro comes with a \"virtual cockpit\" that replaces the instrument panel and center console with digital screens. It's still unclear if Audi will go through with making a production version of the hydrogen car, but the automaker is exploring the technology. 6/11 BMW BMW will collaborate with Toyota to build the hydrogen drivetrains in its 2020 car. BMW says its hydrogen car will have a range exceeding 300 miles and a refuel time of under five minutes. 7/11 Ford Ford is aiming to launch the first affordable, mass-market vehicle by 2017. In January 2013, Ford announced it was teaming up with Mercedes-Benz's parent company Daimler and Nissan to accelerate the creation of fuel cell technology. There's no word yet on how the car will perform. 8/11 Mercedes-Benz Mercedes-Benz will launch its plug-in hydrogen car called the GLC F-Cell at some point this year. The automaker says it will have an all-electric range of 30 miles and a collective range of 310 miles with the hydrogen fuel cell. The hydrogen tank can be refilled in just three minutes. Mercedes said the fuel-cell stack is being developed through its joint venture with Ford. 9/11 Riversimple Welsh start-up Riversimple is allowing UK drivers lease its hydrogen-powered car, the Rasa, this year. Riversimple will offer three-month and six-month leases for 60 to 80 UK residents. The car boasts a 300-mile range and is super light-weight, coming in under 1,300 pounds. The steering wheel is wrapped in a material called alcantara, giving it a velvety, luxurious feel. 10/11 Pininfarina Italian design house Pininfarina is doing a limited production run of its hydrogen-powered car, the H2 Speed. It can accelerate to 62 mph in just 3.4 seconds. The car can reach a top speed of 186 mph and refuels in just three minutes. Pininfarina has yet to release the car's range. The design house is building 10 versions of the H2 Speed, with production models hitting the roads in 12 to 14 months. But it will cost a whopping $2.5 million.
