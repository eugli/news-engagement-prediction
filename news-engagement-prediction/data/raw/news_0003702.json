They also retrieved the bodies of three Chinese tourists. \nThe fishing boat then made a seven-hour journey back to Kota Kinabalu, arriving at 1.45am. \nChia Pu Yap, the owner of the fishing boat JN 4563/2/F, instructed the crew to cook hot food for the survivors during the journey. \n“They must have been starving after drifting at sea for more than 24 hours,” he said in an interview with Sin Chew Daily . \nChia, who was celebrating Chinese New Year in the peninsula at the time, said his crew contacted him about the discovery on Saturday afternoon via other fishing boats. \nFishing boats always stay in contact with each other via walkie-talkies and stay ready to help in the event of an emergency, he said. \nHe was informed by his crew that his fishing boat was the only one around that area at that time. Chia immediately instructed his crew to save every person they could. \n“Those of us who make a living on the sea will always help each other out. In the case of accidents, we will definitely lend a helping hand. All fishing boats will do so,” he said. \nChia also contacted the police through his friend so the authorities were waiting at the jetty when the boat carrying the survivors and the bodies arrived at Kota Kinabalu on Monday morning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:00:34.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
