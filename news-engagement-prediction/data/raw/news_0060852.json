The monitor is required by the judge to be present the entire time Robin is with his 6-year-old son. \nWe're told the monitor was sitting at a table with someone from the Dept. of Children and Family Services, who was actually there to monitor the monitor after Paula complained about him. He too, we're told, only drank water. \nAs for why they went to Nobu ... it's Julian's fav.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:42:38.036+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
