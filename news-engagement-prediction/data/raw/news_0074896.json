The album was released two hours earlier in order to gauge fans’ reactions. \nHowever, the night did not unfold as expected due to a presumed malfunction on the Melon site. At 11 p.m. KST, Lovelyz’s album had secured 17th place on Melon’s music chart. Unfortunately, from 11:27 p.m. KST to 1 a.m. KST, Lovelyz’s new album was nowhere to be found on the site, causing a great deal of confusion and disappointment for fans. \nAt 1 a.m. KST, Lovelyz’s album was back on the site in 18th place. Woolim Entertainment, Lovelyz’s management agency, stated that they received an official apology from Melon but still feel wronged by the situation. \nSome fans are saying that this was an instance of unfortunate collateral damage from the music chart reorganization . Other fans, however, are wondering if this incident has anything to do with the fact that Lovelyz recently switched distributors from Loen, which owns Melon, to CJ E&M.
