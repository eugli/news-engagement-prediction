The third truck is seen above Smugglers then use putty and paint to camouflage the breach on the American side of the fence, making the gate almost indiscernible Trucks from Mexico reportedly pour through the fence into Douglas, Arizona, on a daily basis Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council, told Fox News that Border Patrol officers constantly struggle to keep on top of smugglers who cut their way through fencing. One tactic in drive-throughs, Judd said, is to cut a large rectangular hole in the border fence and attach it to hinges so that it can open and close like a gate. Smugglers then use putty and paint to camouflage the breach on the American side of the fence, making the gate almost indiscernible. 'They're very, very difficult to detect,' he said. 'Fences can be defeated.' But Judd said a border wall would be harder to thwart. President Donald Trump has taken his first step to building the wall by requesting proposals from contractors. Trump plans to have a prototype built by mid-March. US Customs and Border Protection issued the preliminary requests on Friday and said it will accept proposals next month for the design of the wall. The agency also said the it would release requests on or about March 6 asking companies for prototype ideas. The wall has been estimated to cost $6.5million per mile for a fence to keep out crossers on foot, while vehicle barriers will cost $1.8million, according to the Government Accountability Office. US Border Patrol agents survey their surroundings in Douglas, Arizona (above) President Barack Obama's so-called 'catch and release' policies often allowed undocumented people to move freely while they awaited court dates. Here undocumented people are processed by border agents on the side of the road near Douglas, Arizona Judd told Fox News that agents continue to grapple with security problems from the Obama years. 'We weren’t allowed to do our job,' he said. President Barack Obama's so-called 'catch and release' policies often allowed undocumented people to move freely while they awaited court dates. Most asylum seekers were accepted into the US under these policies. The border itself continues to suffer from gaps exploited by smugglers, Judd said. Toward the end of Obama's last term, Judd said only 20 per cent of the agency's workforce was patrolling the southern border due to extensive paperwork required to process asylum seekers. 'We just cannot continue with the same management that we’ve had, which created our problems,' he said. 'We expect the president to drain the swamp - ours should be the first one drained. 'We have to hit the restart button.' RELATED ARTICLES ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:06:29.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
