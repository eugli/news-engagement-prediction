In those cases, many of them are released into the US while their request for asylum is processed in the courts. \nThe policy being considered by the Trump administration, however, would direct them to be jailed or detained until their cases are heard or they establish “credible fear” of prosecution. \nAsylum cases, however, often take years before they are resolved in backlogged courts. \nA White House official told the WSJ the policies were still an early draft and that the Department of Homeland Security had raised some objects to some of the policies.
