Jimmy Kimmel made Ivanka jokes, stars spoke out against Trump’s anti-immigrant policies, and blue ACLU ribbons abounded. And then, of course, there was the mix-up of all mix-ups : Faye Dunaway accidentally announced that La La Land had won Best Picture when the award was intended for Moonlight .\nOn the surface, the political commentary and the Best Picture gaffe have absolutely nothing to do with each other. But in an interview with Breitbart, President Trump teased out a connection.\n“I think they were focused so hard on politics that they didn’t get the act together at the end,” he said. “It was a little sad. It took away from the glamour of the Oscars. It didn’t feel like a very glamorous evening. I’ve been to the Oscars. There was something very special missing, and then to end that way was sad.”\nApparently “more from President Trump’s exclusive interview with Breitbart News is forthcoming” — maybe he’ll debunk the Nicole Kidman clapping conspiracy next.\nRelated Everything We Know About That Oscars Best Picture Mix-up Tags: donald trump oscars 2017 love and war politics Donald Trump Has an Explanation for That Oscars Gaffe    \nDomino \n \nThe Kit \n'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' is Getting Cancelled\n  27 mins ago Donald  \n11:12 a.m. The First Latina Senator Wants Women to Stop Second-guessing Themselves Catherine Cortez Masto was always surrounded by men.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:08:38.230+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
