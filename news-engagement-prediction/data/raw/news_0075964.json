You do entertain us and not always on purpose. \nThe look on Meryl Streep’s face alone is worth every moment of that boring, sanctimonious, self-centered hot mess called the Oscars. \nGuess what had just happened onstage when they snapped this photo: Watch the moment when \"La La Land\" is mistakenly announced best picture winner https://t.co/h3WScQsfxB pic.twitter.com/5QzqnwfwRv \n— Los Angeles Times (@latimes) February 27, 2017 \nOH YEAH, that’s it. They had awarded the Best Picture Oscar to the WRONG MOVIE. \nAnd this wasn’t just some editing Oscar or for visual effects, this was the BIG ONE. \nHence also the look on Matt Damon’s and the Rock’s face. We know how you feel, Rock. pic.twitter.com/vriy105eeI", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T18:51:31.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
