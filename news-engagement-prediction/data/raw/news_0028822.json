Ministry fire rangers extinguished the blaze with the help of suppression efforts from the air, according to the province.\nThe two men pleaded guilty in Ontario court in January, and were each fined $500 for starting a fire in a restricted fire zone without a permit. They were also each ordered to pay $3,000 in restitution costs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:59:20.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
