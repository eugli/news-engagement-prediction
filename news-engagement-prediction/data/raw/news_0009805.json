(Matthew Emmons/USA Today Sports)  29 AM \nTom Brady stole Super Bowl LI from the Falcons...and then someone stole his jersey from him. \nThe Patriots quarterback said the jersey he wore during the game was taken at some point after the victory. \n\"It was right here. I know exactly where I put it,\" Brady said, via USA Today Sports. That report also noted that backup QB Jimmy Garoppolo was instructing others players to look around for the missing jersey. \n\"This is not good,\" Brady added. \"It was right here and now I don't have it. Not good.\" \nDan Hanzus of NFL.com captured Brady informing Patriots owner Robert Kraft about the theft in on video.

As the five-time Super Bowl champion quarterback walked to the team bus he confirmed to ESPN that he believed it had been stolen, saying, \"Yeah. It will be on eBay soon, I guess.\" Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T12:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:58:27.530+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
