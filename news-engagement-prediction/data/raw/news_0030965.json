We have to think through every demographic. \n\n\"We need the modern version of a public-service announcement campaign. It can be done quickly if there is a will.” \n\n\"We are going through this period of time right here where unfortunately some of the people that are winning are the people that spend their time trying to get the most clicks, not tell the most truth,” he said. “It’s killing people’s minds in a way.” \n\n“All of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news. \n\n\"We must try to squeeze this without stepping on freedom of speech and of the press, but we must also help the reader. Too many of us are just in the complain category right now and haven’t figured out what to do.” \nSo - exactly who will choose what is \"stepping on freedom of speech\"? Leave it to the liberal billionaires to decide, throttle, and choke off differences of opinion. Well Cook has another solution... start 'em young... \n“It’s almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid.” \n\nBut he is optimistic. “ In some ways kids will be the easiest to educate. At least before a certain age, they are very much in listen and understand [mode], and they then push their parents to act. We saw this with environmental issues: kids learning at school and coming home and saying why do you have this plastic bottle? Why are you throwing it away?” \nCook concludes naively that this crackdown would help providers of quality journalism (like CNN?) drive out clickbait... \n\"The outcome of that is that truthful, reliable, non-sensational, deep news outlets will win.\" \nSo to clarify Cook's thoughts - tech firms should throttle newspeak from sources they deem 'fake', so-called \"high quality journalism\" should be promoted, and kids should be indoctrinated from an early age to read what the government (or liberal billionaire tech CEOs) deems 'proper'... \nWhen will President Trump be shadow-banned from Twitter?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:58:48.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
