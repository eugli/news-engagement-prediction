Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nDonald Trump's penchant for fast food is well documented. We all know the new President of the United States loves a Big Mac. And a bucket of KFC . And a slice or two of Domino's pizza. \nMost of us enjoy these things. Trump, though, takes his adoration for crispy wings and salty fries a little further than most. Observers note that the 70-year-old eats them regularly. Apparently he doesn't exercise much either, by the way. \nThe president's appreciation for fast food is partly down to taste, efficiency and habit – these attributes clearly have bearing on the busy reality star-turned-politician's oddly unrefined palatte. https://www.instagram.com/p/BF4raEHmhag/embed \nBut, perhaps a little bizarrely, Trump also eats a lot of fast food due to its supposed cleanliness. He dislikes germs. But he loves consistency – the president doesn't want his organised, streamlined days to be disrupted by alien food or unwashed lettuce. \n“One bad hamburger, you can destroy McDonald’s ,\" he once told CNN . \n“I’m a very clean person. I like cleanliness, and I think you’re better off going there than maybe someplace that you have no idea where the food’s coming from. It’s a certain standard. \nHe added: \"I think the food’s good.” Read More Asda is doing something seriously controversial with tomato ketchup \nDespite Trump's lavish pursuits in other areas, food, it appears, is just a chore to be managed. He's a busy man and needs a quick fix. It's fuel over pleasure – a \"problem to be solved,\" as Gov. Chris Christie once told The Washington Examiner of his occasional dining partner's ways. \nWe saw that the likes of McDonald's and Domino's were staples of Trump's campaign trail on the road to winning the US election. And, of course, it's likely that his persuasion for fast food is also part of his appeal to the 'working' people of America. Culinary sophistication has little place in his call to 'Make America Great Again'. \nThe New York Times even suggested Trump could be the \"nation's fast food president\". \n“A ‘fish delight,’ sometimes, right?” Trump once said of McDonald’s. “The Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. It’s great stuff.” \nHe does like it, then, however much it supplements his image. \nBut we can't help but also notice that he dines on fast food because he perceives it as being so \"clean\" (it certainly puts a fresh take on the whole idea of 'clean eating'). It seems that he indulges at least a few times a week. \nWe should say that he doesn't survive entirely on burgers and crispy taco bowls. The rest of the time, Trump might eat out of his office from the Trump Grill. And remember, he likes his steak very, very well-done .
