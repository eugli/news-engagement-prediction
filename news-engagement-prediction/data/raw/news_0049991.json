He was in tears and crying down the phone.” \nAn FA spokesperson said: “We are investigating to establish whether there has been any breach of The FA rules relating to betting.” \nThe Gambling Commission has also opened an enquiry as to whether the bookmaker has “met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity”. \n–‘Bit of banter’– Shaw, who was released by non league Sutton for an earlier incident in 2013 when he climbed into the stands having taken exception to remarks made about his physique by fans, laughed off his eating the pie seven minutes from the end of the 2-0 defeat as a “bit of banter”. \n“I think there were a few people (who placed bets). Obviously we (the players) are not allowed to bet. I think a few mates and a few of the fans (did),” Shaw told the newspaper. \n“I thought I would give them a bit of banter and let’s do it. All the subs were on and we were 2-0 down. It was just a bit of banter for them. It is something to make the occasion as well and you can look back and say it was part of it and we got our ticket money back.” \nHowever, The Gambling Commission, which licenses and regulates gambling in Britain, says it is looking into whether there was any “irregularity in the betting market and establishing whether the operator has met its licence requirement to conduct its business with integrity”. \n“Integrity in sport is not a joke and we have opened an investigation to establish exactly what happened,” said enforcement and intelligence director Richard Watson. \nThe bookmaker in question — who sponsored the Sutton shirts for the match — tweeted it had paid out a “five-figure sum” to one punter who had bet on Shaw to eat the pie. \nClub chairman Bruce Elliott told BBC Radio that Shaw could not resist garnering publicity. \n“He has got himself in the papers again and the fame obviously has gone to his head a little bit, but we will soon bring him back down to earth, don’t worry about that.” Okogba ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:18:18.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
