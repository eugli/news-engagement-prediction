So that’s their problem and not the concern of the SIEC”. \nFaith And Support For APC \nOn his part, Governor Ibrahim Gaidam commended the people of the state for reaffirming their faith in the APC. \nA statement issued by his spokesman, Abdullahi Bego, said that the governor “is very pleased and hugely grateful that the people of the state have reaffirmed their faith and support for the All Progressives Congress (APC) by electing all the party’s candidates in last Saturday’s (February 11) Local Government election. \n“That all the APC chairmanship candidates won in the election shows the degree to which the APC manifesto remains an appealing document to most of the people of the state”. \nGovernor Gaidam was also pleased that a significant number of registered voters across Yobe State participated in the election and voted for the candidates of their choice. \n“His Excellency, Governor Gaidam strongly believes that given the security and other challenges that the state has experienced in the recent past, last weekend’s polls, which were commendably peaceful, can give us hope that normalcy has returned and that we can take pride in our capacity as a people to collectively organise and participate in elections at the grassroots level,” the statement added. \nThe governor has promised to work with the elected chairmen and their councilors, to go farther in his determination to improve the people’s living conditions at the grassroots. \nThe election observers also applauded the conduct of the poll and commended the Yobe State government for organising the election, despite the security problem bedeviling the state while urging other states to emulate Yobe. \nThe spokesman of the observers, Mr Victor Kalu, said: “We observed that law turnouts in some polling stations was based on non-enforcement of the vehicular movement and we want to recommend that such laws be enforced subsequently. \n“On the whole, the Yobe State government under the leadership of Governor Gaidam has done very well to have conduct election on three occasions, despite the insurgency affecting the state”.
