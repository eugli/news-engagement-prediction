Mr Moscovici said: \"If Marine Le Pen comes in office, if she asks for a referendum on Frexit, what would Europe be about? Europe was founded precisely in order that France and Germany and others work together in a common project. “That is why precisely it cannot happen, it won't happen, it must not happen.” On his trip to Westminster Central Hall, Mr Macron, 39, openly said he wanted “banks, talents, researchers, academics and so on” to cross the Channel and join him in what he hopes will be his Paris headquarters after the second round of the French election on May 7.
