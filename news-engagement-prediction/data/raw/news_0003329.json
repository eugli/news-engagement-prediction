Terry McAuliffe. \nNestle USA is currently based in downtown Glendale, where it has been since the late 1980s. \nThe company will reportedly move into an office building at 1812 N. Moore St., which has sat vacant since construction finished nearly four years ago and is the tallest building in the D.C. region. \nIt will occupy up to 10 floors, one source said, and bring at least 700 employees, although reports have varied on the actual number of employees affected. \nThe Rosslyn area has suffered from a slowdown in federal job growth and McAuliffe has been working to diversify northern Virginia’s job base. \nNestle USA said the move brings its headquarters closer to its customers. The company said 85 percent of its top customers and 75 percent of its factories are in the eastern U.S. \n(TM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
