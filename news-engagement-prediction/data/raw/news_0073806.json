Moonlight , you guys won best picture,\" Horowitz announced onstage. \nThe epic live-TV snafu topped Twitter's most-talked about moments, followed by Kimmel's mid-show tweets at Trump . After pointing out that two hours into the show Trump had yet to weigh in on Twitter, Kimmel tweeted, \"Hey, u up?\" and \"#Merylsayshi,\" referring to Meryl Streep — the beloved and celebrated Academy Award winner Trump has referred to as \"overrated.\" \nKimmel's first tweet became his most retweeted post ever — in under 15 minutes — and currently has 230,000 retweets. \nThe third most-tweeted moment of Sunday's Academy Awards was La La Land 's incorrect announcement as best picture winner. \nFences star Viola Davis earned the fourth moment for her best supporting actress win, while La La Land 's Emma Stone took the fifth spot for her best actress nod. \nTwitter announced the stats late Sunday night with a cheeky reference to the night's envelope mix-up. \n\"We checked the data - Moonlight really did take this one,\" read the post.
