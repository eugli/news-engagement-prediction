(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)  48 PM \nHere’s one President Trump prediction that won’t generate much controversy: Patriots by 8. \nTrump, who insists fraudulent votes cost him the Electoral College, and argued with the media over the size of the crowd at his inauguration, played it safe with his latest bit of numbers crunching. \nIn a pre-game interview with Fox-TV, the president reluctantly made the safe pick, siding with New England over the Cinderella Atlanta Falcons. \n“I hate to make predictions,” said Trump, who spent all last year predicting he’d win the White House. “I’ll say the Patriots will win by 8 points.” Trump said he had to \"stick up\" for his friends, like Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. (Patrick Smith/Getty Images) \nTrump, who once owned the rival New Jersey Generals from the upstart USFL, praised the Falcons, but said he had to be practical. \n“You have to stick up for your friends right?” Trump said referencing Patriots owner Robert Kraft and quarterback Tom Brady. \n“I think the other team is fantastic,” Trump said. “There’s less pressure on the Patriots because they’ve been there.” Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:12:52.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
