And better yet, the first one is coming soon. \nThe special, which was filmed in Washington, D.C., will be called 2017 . It will be released on April 4. \n“Louis has been one of the most innovative comedy voices in this new era of stand up,” Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix, said in a release. “He has also been a thought leader in the business of comedy. We have marveled at his creativity and his ability to invent comedically and commercially, and are thrilled that he is bringing his newest specials to Netflix.” \nIn the last decade, Louis C.K. has become one of the titans of the comedy world. Over his career, he’s won six Emmys and has been nominated 37 times , according to the Television Academy’s website. \nIn recent years, he has been equally applauded for his innovative business tactics, including selling his 2011 standup special, “Louis C.K. Live at the Beacon Theater,” through his website for five dollars, as well as the first episode of his show “ Horace and Pete ,” which was released out of nowhere. \nBut mostly, he’s just funny, so you should probably watch the Netflix specials.
