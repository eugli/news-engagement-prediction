That get-up isn’t meant to fool you – it’s for the bears in China’s Wolong Nature Reserve, which must not get used to human contact. \nDressing up like this is designed to keep the pandas wary of people, so they steer clear of the villages and farms that dot their territory. No one knows if it works – but for added authenticity, the costumes are doused with panda pee.

The panda keepers are trying to find a bear with a radio tracking collar that is in training for release into the wild. \nPandas once ranged across China, Myanmar and Vietnam. Now they can be found in just a few mountainous parts of China, amounting to about one-hundredth of their former habitat, with a mere 1864 animals left in the wild. But that is up from a low of about 1000 in the 1970s . \nChina hopes that its captive breeding programme will help. While the bears are notoriously difficult to breed, 38 cubs were born across China in 2015. The newborns are fed, weighed, massaged and generally cosseted. Ami Vitale/National Geographic \nCubs are chosen for freedom if they seem independent, wary of humans and other animals, and are able to find food and shelter. Appreciation of cosplay is optional. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline “Bears in the wood” \nMore on these topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:27:49.180+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
