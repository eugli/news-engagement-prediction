I work here. My daughter went to school here and it’s the damn best school in America.” Kim Mulkey sounds off on recent national scrutiny about #Baylor and female student safety on campus after Lady Bears' win. pic.twitter.com/Jy8YUDhtBW \n— John Elizondo (@JohnElizondo25) February 25, 2017 \nMulkey addressed her comments again during the postgame press conference to further explain her comment. \n“I’m just tired of hearing it. I’m tired of people talking on it on a national scale that don’t know what they’re talking about,” she said. “If they didn’t sit in those meetings and they weren’t a part of the investigation, you’re repeating things that you heard. It’s over. It’s done. This is a great institution, and I would send my daughter here, and I would pay for anyone else’s daughter to come here. I work here every day. I’m in the know. And I’m tired of hearing it. This is a great institution. The problems that we have at Baylor are no different than the problems at any other school in America. Period. Move on. Find another story to write.” Mulkey explained her comments in the post-game press conference. #Baylor pic.twitter.com/emhBU1Ytew \n— John Elizondo (@JohnElizondo25) February 25, 2017 \nA new lawsuit alleges that at least 31 Baylor football players committed at least 52 acts of rape over a four year period starting in 2011. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. 0 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T01:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T04:19:56.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
