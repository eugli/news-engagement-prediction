He shot for major fashion brands and magazines such as Gucci and GQ China.\nDetails of his death on Friday are still emerging, but he is believed to have taken his own life.\nDian Hanson , editor at German publisher Taschen, said Ren had fallen into a \"crushing depression\" in October which was \"intensified by global political instability. The months of pain finally proved too much\".\nBorn in Changchun in north-east Jilin province, Ren first picked up photography when attending college in Beijing. He began shooting pictures of his friends out of boredom.\nOver time he gained fame for his striking photographs, often featuring young naked Chinese models in unusual and sculptural poses. He roped in friends and acquaintances for many of these pictures, even his own mother for one series.\nA true child of the social media generation, he freely shared his works on his website and his Facebook, Instagram and Flickr accounts, accruing thousands of devoted young fans, some of whom would apply to model for him.\nMany have seen his works as a commentary on evolving sexual mores and the struggle for creative and sexual freedom in a conservative, tightly controlled society.\nThe British Journal of Photography Quote: d him as once saying: \"I don't want others having the impression that Chinese people are robots.... Or they do have sexual genitals but always keep them as some secret treasures.\"\nBut his explicit works inevitably provoked a strong response from authorities in China, where pornography is illegal and where artists have often fought against censorship and state interference. He was arrested several times, his work confiscated.\nHe consistently denied that his photography had a political message. \"My pictures' politics have nothing to do with China. It's Chinese politics that wants to interfere with my art,\" he told digital magazine Dazed in 2015.\n'All turn into snakes' Along with his photography, Ren Hang frequently posted emotional erotic poetry on his social media accounts. Here is an extract from a 2016 poem called Love:\nMy kisses can be finely linked into a line, just like\na snake slithers across every rugged reef rock on\nyour trembling body, afterwards you turn\ninto a snake, I turn into a rock, still afterwards we\nall turn into snakes, intertwined together, we\nall turn into rocks, hitting each other.\nRen Hang exhibited prolifically, staging more than 20 solo and 70 group art shows, and publishing several monographs of his work. At the time of his death he had just released a new book with Taschen, and launched an exhibition at an Amsterdam gallery.\nRen Hang long struggled with depression, which he talked about openly. On his website, he wrote candid entries about his struggle with the illness, which included frequent hallucinations and hearing voices.\nAmong his latest entries on his Weibo microblogging account, posted at the end of January, was a stark one-liner: \"Every year I always have the same wish: to die an early death.\" It was followed up with another line: \"Hope that it comes true this year.\"\nSince his death, grieving fans have been posting tributes online. One commenter on Quote: : \"I am not sad, because you weren't happy here.\"", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/FCCD/production/_94871746_281a_ren_hang_fo_05318_1610131248_id_1083831.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/F8E5/production/_94871736_041a_ren_hang_fo_05318_1610131253_id_1083903.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/126D/production/_94871740_206a_ren_hang_fo_05318_1610131249_id_1083849.jpg", "http://www.bjp-online.com/2017/02/ren-hang-leading-chinese-photographer-has-died-aged-29/", "http://www.renhang.org/My-Mum", "https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/company/blog/976.ren_hang.htm", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/123DD/production/_94871747_267a_ren_hang_fo_05318_1610131249_id_1083840.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14AED/production/_94871748_135a_ren_hang_fo_05318_1610131251_id_1083876.jpg", "https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/sex/all/05318/facts.ren_hang.htm", "http://www.dazeddigital.com/photography/article/24031/1/ren-hang-on-nature-nudity-and-politics"], "published": "2017-02-28T11:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T13:11:19.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
