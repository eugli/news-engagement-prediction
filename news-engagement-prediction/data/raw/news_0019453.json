Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email Liverpool midfielder Adam Lallana is set to become the latest Reds player to commit his future to the club.\nThe Telegraph report that the England international is close to finalising a new four-year deal at Anfield, said to be worth £150,000-a-week.\nThat will keep the 28-year-old at the club until 2021 and is a reward for his fine form under Jurgen Klopp this season.\nLallana joined the Reds from Southampton in 2014 for £25million and this new deal will ensure that his peak years will be spent on Merseyside.\nReds warned off fresh Brereton move Liverpool have been linked with a move for the Forest hotshot (Photo: Rex Features) Nottingham Forest have warned Liverpool off a fresh move for 17-year-old Ben Brereton, writes Mirror Football's Alex Richards.\nThe Reds had a £2.5million approach for the Brereton rejected late in the January transfer window.\nThe Merseysiders remain keen on the young striker, as do rivals Manchester United.\nAnd Brereton served notice of his potential at the weekend, scoring a late winner for Forest in their 2-1 win over Aston Villa.\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in Dietmar Hamann stands by Klopp criticism Share this video Watch Next But after causing outrage among Forest fans by parting with Oliver Burke in August, Forest owner Fawaz Al Hasawi has declared that he has no interest in parting with any more of the club's young stars - and that includes Brereton.\n“Why would we want to sell him?\" said Al Hasawi, speaking to the Nottingham Post.\n“We have similar players coming through the academy – we have invested money in the academy and Gary [Brazil] has done an amazing job, which is why we have good players coming through now.\n\"We want them to play here.\"\nSturridge can save Liverpool's season, says Rush Sturridge has been left of the bench for a lot of the season (Photo: Alex Livesey/Getty Images) Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is the man to haul the Reds back into the top four, claims Kop great Ian Rush.\nThe England international has been a peripheral figure this season and has not started since the costly 2-2 draw at Sunderland.\nSturridge, who has endured yet more injury issues this term, has scored just six times all season, but Rush insists Jurgen Klopp should turn to the former Chelsea star, report the Liverpool Echo.\nHaving exited both cup competitions and with the schedule easing to give Liverpool the luxury of one game per week, Rush believes Sturridge can be used on a more regular basis.\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch this video again Video will play in Ian Rush discusses Liverpool's form ahead of Spurs clash Share this video Watch Next \"Daniel Sturridge is probably the most gifted striker we have got,\" said Rush, speaking as he surprised local over-35s side Railway Formby Vets FC by turning out in a five-a-side match to promote the chance to win £3million for just £1 on The Football Pools.\n\"I was made up that he didn't go in January and I hope he is still here next year but you have got to fight for your place. I think he will fight for his place.\n\"One thing for certain this year is that we will need Daniel Sturridge and once he gets that chance he has to take it.\n\"And when he does take it and starts scoring again I think he'll play a major part in Liverpool making the top four.\"\nLallana: We need to win ugly like Chelsea Lallana wants to learn from the Chelsea defeat (Photo: Liverpool FC via Getty) Adam Lallana claims Liverpool need to learn from Chelsea how to win ugly, writes Mirror Football's David Anderson.\nLiverpool's season has disintegrated since the start of the year and they have won only one of their last 10 games.\nThe England star is impressed by Chelsea's ability to grind out results, even when they are not playing to their full potential.\n\"You can see they have a lot of experience and that they're used to winning,\" said Lallana.\n\"They know how to win games even when not at their best. You don't have to always win by scoring five or six.\n\"Maybe that's an area we need to improve on. We maybe need to realise how good we are at times.\"\nRead More Liverpool FC Liverpool News Transfer news Squad Fixtures Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Liverpool FC Newsletter Follow @mirrorfootball Subscribe to our Liverpool FC newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Liverpool transfer news Liverpool FC", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/02/08/liverpool-tie-adam-lallana-peak-years-150000-a-week-contract/?WT.mc_id=tmg_share_tw", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=mirrorfootball", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/3876/4221396001_5315698403001_5315683294001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201702/299/4221396001_5311212453001_5311211069001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://www.nottinghampost.com/why-would-we-want-to-sell-him-forest-owner-fawaz-al-hasawi-reacts-to-ben-brereton-speculation/story-30118919-detail/story.html"], "published": "2017-02-09T10:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:31:37.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
