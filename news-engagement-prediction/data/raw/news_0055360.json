He collects $120,000 a year in his Screen Actors Guild pension fund ... He is a Hollywood elitist.\" \nWhile it is true Trump collects a six-figure income from SAG, the figure Clooney quotes may be off. Trump disclosed during his campaign that he received $110,228 in funds from the organization.   \nClooney, who advocated for Hillary Clinton in 2016, also called Trump a \"demagogue\" and a hypocrite, the Huffington Post reports. \n\"We have Donald Trump which is …\" Clooney said, taking a pause, \"... hard to imagine. It catches in your throat. But we’ll fix it. We have to.\" \nLater in the interview, Clooney also took aim at Steve Bannon, calling him an elitist and a \"failed film writer and director.\" \n\"He wrote a Shakespearean rap musical about the L.A. riots that he couldn't get made,\" Clooney said. \"He made a lot of money off of 'Seinfeld.' He's elitist Hollywood. I mean, that's the reality.\" \nClooney's comments were met with mixed responses on social media. \nSome agreed with his remarks and approved. \n\"Trump's not only a Hollywood elitist he has always been part of the [1 percent],\" one woman commented on the New York Daily News' Facebook page. \"He has no idea what the average person goes through.\" \n\"I would rather George Clooney as president rather than this complete id*ot Trump any day,\" commented a second person. \nHowever, some took issue with Clooney's comments. \n\"You people are a disgrace to America if you don't like my President Donald trump please find your own country ,\" wrote one woman in response. \n\"Look I'm disgusted at #45 but you Clooney didn't help the cause during the election since you hosted a 100,000 a plate dinner for Hillary to steal the primaries from Bernie,\" wrote another.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:54:28.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
