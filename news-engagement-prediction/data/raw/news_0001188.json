Penn State joined many of the region’s top programs Sunday afternoon, verbally extending an offer to Perkasie, Pa., native Nick Tarburton . A four-star prospect from Pennridge, Tarburton was on campus back in the summer for the staff’s seven-on-seven tournament, but Sunday was his first true unofficial visit to State College.\n“The whole visit was great. Just seeing the stadium and all of their facilities, everything is excellent,” said Tarburton. “Their stadium is incredible. Walking up there was really cool.\n\"I also got to go to a wrestling match for a little bit. Just seeing how committed their fans are there, I can only imagine what it’s like inside Beaver Stadium with 107,000 fans.”\nTarburton spoke with Penn State defensive line coach Sean Spencer and head coach James Franklin about 10 days ago over the phone, but he was able to have a much more in-depth conversation with the two, plus defensive coordinator Brent Pry , this afternoon.\n“After lunch, I met with Coach Franklin, Coach Pry and Coach Spencer,” Tarburton said. “It was a real good talk about what they like about me and what Penn State could do for me. I enjoyed getting to know them.\n\"That’s also when Coach Franklin offered me personally, which was so cool. It’s great to have an offer from Penn State now.”\nCurrently, Tarburton, who's 6-3, 230 pounds, is listed as an inside linebacker, but he could grow into a defensive end. During his junior season, he totaled 96 tackles, 17 tackles for loss and six sacks, earning first-team All-State honors in Class .\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-3.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/sxj4rcba5cwvxp04xwev)", "https://res-3.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/sxj4rcba5cwvxp04xwev"], "published": "2017-01-30T02:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:09:20.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
