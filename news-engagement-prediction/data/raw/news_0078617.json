Quade and his girlfriend escaped serious injuries. Mike Quade  46  46 p.m. ET \nTwins Triple-A manager Mike Quade and his girlfriend escaped serious injuries in a multi-vehicle crash Saturday near the team's spring training complex in Fort Myers, Fla. \nAmong the people who came to their assistance: four Twins minor leaguers whose vehicle also got caught up in the wreck. \nQuade's SUV was stopped at a traffic signal when it was rammed from behind by another vehicle traveling about 45-50 mph, the (Minneapolis) Star Tribune reported Sunday . His girlfriend, Rebecca Kraus, was a passenger in Quade's vehicle. \nMORE: Sean Rodriguez out 3-5 months after car crash \n\"We can't believe we're not dead,\" Quade told the Star Tribune. \nThe crash set off a chain-reaction collision that damaged three other vehicles. One of the vehicles held a group of young Twins farmhands identified by the Star Tribune as catcher Ben Rortvedt, pitcher Austin Tribby, outfielder Caleb Hamilton and infielder Dane Hutcheon. \n“Two of them went to Rebecca’s side and helped her get out of the car and off the road. They stayed with her and took care of her,” Quade told the Star Tribune. “Two came over to me and said, ‘Sir, are you OK?’ Yeah, I think so. So they went to the car in front of me. There were two kids in there, but they were both belted in, thank God, and the mother was OK.” \nMORE: Royals honor Yordano Ventura ahead of spring training \n“The kids did one hell of a job,\" Quade, a former Cubs manager, added. \"They handled themselves so well, kept their heads, were so helpful. They could not have been better. We’re as lucky as you can be.” \nQuade, who will turn 60 on March 12, was still shaken up a day later, but he did offer a small bit of comic relief. From the Star Tribune. As police gathered information from Quade, he mentioned he was in Fort Myers for spring training with the Twins. “And one of the kids says, ‘We play for the Twins!’ I said, ‘You haven’t played for me — I’m the Triple-A manager.’ “ \nIt's unlikely any of the four players will join Quade in Rochester, N.Y., this season. All of them made their professional debuts in rookie ball last year. \nThe Star Tribune reported Quade's right shoulder was sore Sunday. Kraus was bleeding from her mouth and nose after the crash and was suffering soreness a day later.
