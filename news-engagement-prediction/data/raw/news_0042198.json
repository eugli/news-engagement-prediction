In a nutshell, it is an opening for all serious politicians from all shades to compare notes for the realisation of the aforementioned.” \nOn his part, Senator Matthew Urhoghide, PDP, Edo South said, “All sides must show respect for the rule of law. If the Makarfi led group is not satisfied, they could go the Supreme Court. If I were to honestly advice, the Makarfi group should allow Sheriff settle down and organise a fresh national convention where new party leaders will be elected.” \nAlso reacting, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, PDP, Abia South said, “Most PDP members will be very disenchanted with this ruling because Sheriff is seen as an interloper. \n“In a way it is good. Now all those who want reform of PDP will move to form a new party and use it to expand the democratic space in Nigeria.” \nThe deputy national chairman of the Sheriff faction, Dr. Cairo Ojuogboh, on his part lauded the decision which he said, was in respect of the rule of law. \nSpeaking with Sunday Vanguard, Dr. Ojuigboh said the verdict of the court has demonstrated that there was “no victor, no vanquished and has made the process of negotiation more imperative.” “This is a victory for the people and the rule of law. There is no victor no vanquished. We are using this opportunity to appeal to everybody to find a political solution. We have always maintained that there is no room for legal solution to a party problem. \n“We will now go to the negotiation table and see how we will resolve the problem. “We will appeal to Governor Fayose that as a governor of the party he is the son of the party. This is not the time for litigation. We have said before that this is not the time for Supreme Court. We appeal to him to calm down and listen to the party. The party is ready to hold a national convention. I have spoken to three governors, and they said the way forward is negotiation. The court is not necessary. We should return to the negotiation table” he said. Okogba ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T16:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T11:20:28.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
