Violent crime stats, compared to same period in 2016, increased by 5.72 percent, but those figures reveal a criminal contrast. \nSex crimes dropped by 32 percent while aggravated assaults increased by 45 percent. \nPolice point to a spike in road rage confrontations and drive-by shootings. And Dallas Police officials attribute both crime categories to gang violence. \n“We plan to expand gang unit presence in South Central and Southeast Dallas,” Interim Police Chief David Pughes said Monday. \nPughes said criminal activity tied to gang operations in Oak Cliff and Pleasant Grove areas warrant enhanced police enforcement. \nPughes said the extra gang enforcement can happen despite a continued decline in police personnel. \nPughes told the Public Safety Committee he projects a loss of 350 officers for 2017 due to resignations and retirements. \nDuring the past year, hundreds of DPD officers resigned or retired over concerns about the stability of the Police and Fire Pension System. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
