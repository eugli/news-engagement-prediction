He admitted this stating that it was his full intention.\nHe is a dangerous man who has not only shown absolutely no remorse for his actions but has appeared proud of what he has done.\nMoss denied any involvement but the forensic evidence found on shoes and clothing proved that she had participated in this brutal murder. We gathered CCTV evidence to show the clothing she had been wearing prior to the attack. Moss changed her clothing and shoes before the police could gain access to the flat.\nTogether the pair attempted to hide what had happened when officers attended the address. They are both extremely violent individuals who have murdered a defenceless man without any provocation.\n– Detective Chief Inspector Dave Stopford, South Yorkshire Police Craig Wild. Credit: South Yorkshire Police Webster and Moss will be sentenced for the murder tomorrow.\nMoss will also be sentenced for assaulting a 17-year-old man with a cut throat razor last month.\nThe impact our dearest Craig’s death has had on our family is one of total devastation for all of us who loved him so dearly.\nAs Alison Moss pleaded not guilty we have had to go through the harrowing process of a trial. It’s been too much for most of us to attend and hear the shocking details of the way that Craig was killed.\nThe guilty verdict of Alison Moss today goes some way towards helping us as a family to come together and try to come to terms with his death, knowing that the people who were responsible will be brought to justice.\n– Statement from the family of Craig Wild Sheffield South Yorkshire", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:45:39.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
