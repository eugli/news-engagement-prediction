It's very difficult,\" California Gov. Jerry Brown told reporters during a news conference on Monday evening.\nOn Monday, Brown sent a letter to U.S. President Donald Trump asking him to issue an emergency declaration, which would open up federal assistance for the affected communities, after an emergency overflow channel appeared on the brink of collapse.\nOne-year-old Jace Lawson of Oroville, Calif., sleeps while people wait in line for a meal at a shelter in nearby Chico.

(Marcio Jose Sanchez/Associated Press)\nLittle warning Yolanda Davila, 62, of Thermalito, ended up at the Silver Dollar Fairgrounds in Chico, one of only five shelters in the area taking people with pets. She left home without medicine and dog food in the rush to find shelter before the evacuation deadline.\nShe said that areas such as Sacramento had been issued flood warnings earlier in the week and that authorities should have warned residents near Oroville much sooner.\n\"We didn't have a plan, all we knew is to head north toward Chico,\" Davila said. \"If I knew we had to get out earlier I would have went to the Bay Area.\"\nThe earth-filled dam is just upstream and east of Oroville, a town of about 16,000 people. At 230 metres high, the structure, built between 1962 and 1968, it is some 12 metres taller than the Hoover Dam.\nOn Monday afternoon, crews dropped large bags filled with rocks into a gap at the top of the emergency spillway to rebuild the eroded hillside.\nThe main spillway, a separate channel, is also damaged because part of its concrete lining fell apart last week. Both spillways are to the side of the dam itself, which has not been compromised, engineers said. \n\nA consequence of the #OrovilleDam evacuation, nearby town overrun by released or escaped chickens pic.twitter.com/DRoN9VwAGL \n— @kimbrunhuber \n© Thomson Reuters, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:39:52.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
