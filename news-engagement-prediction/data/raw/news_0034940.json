Tolu Ogunlesi the special assistant on Digital/New Media to President Buhari said on his Twitter account: While, Garba Shehu, the senior special assistant, Media and Publicity to President Buhari told Channels Television on February 14 that Trump’s call to Buhari was not entirely surprising given Nigeria’s place in Africa, especially in areas of diplomacy and politics. “It shouldn’t surprise anyone that President Trump made the choice of making the first African call to the Nigerian President,” he said.
