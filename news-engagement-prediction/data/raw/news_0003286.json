The test was conducted in cooperation with the United States. \nThe SM-3 Block IIA missiles were launched from a US warship equipped with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System and successfully hit a hypothetical target – a ballistic missile, Japan’s Logistics Agency under the Defense Ministry said, according to Japan’s state newspaper Asahi Shimbun.

Both the US and Japan are working together on adjusting the model. \nTwo ground launch tests of the missile were conducted in 2015, but these drills are the first ones to take place at sea. \nJapan and the US retain long-lasting military relations outlined by the Mutual Security Assistance Pact signed in 1952. The agreement ensures comparability of the weapons produced by the two nations and gives Japan access to intelligence information and classified technical information. \nOn Friday, newly appointed Secretary of Defense James Mattis dismissed speculation on Trump’s intentions to scrap the US defense treaty with Tokyo judging by his perception of the Asian region and the alliance. \n“The US-Japan alliance is critical to ensuring that this region remains safe and secure – not just now, but for years to come,” Mattis said at news conference with Japanese Defense Minister Tomomi Inada, Reuters reported. \nThe statement repeated what Mattis said earlier this week while on a visit to another US key Asian ally – South Korea.
