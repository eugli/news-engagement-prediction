One night out on the tiles, to help his old buddy Marlon Dingle to get back in the dating game and Paddy found himself doing the dirty in the back of a motor. \nAll of a sudden, Paddy had some extra marital action and his life changed forever. \nOf course, it didn’t end well. Tess was tragically killed and Rhona has since fallen into the arms of her widowed husband, Pierce. Fast forward a year and on the anniversary of Tess’s passing, Rhona and Paddy’s decree absolute has arrived and their marriage is officially over. \nThings, naturally, ended up getting more complex as Rhona and Paddy had a drunken reminisce about old times which ended with them awkwardly locking lips. After months of trying to put his love for Rhona out of his head, this could bring those feelings bubbling to the surface again. \nThe question is, should the Emmerdale writers reform Paddy and Rhona’s marriage? \nLet’s face it, Paddy and Rhona has some tough times. He stood by Rhona during the dark days of her painkiller addiction and seemed to look downtrodden at other times. \nWhat Paddy needs to remember is that he had started playing away from home, so the marriage was no longer on solid foundations. Has anything really changed since then? Does Paddy only really want Rhona because she is now with Pierce? \nIs Chas a better match for Paddy then? They certainly have some interesting dates as Paddy takes Hugh Grant style bumbling awkwardness to the extreme. \nBut is it something that is ever going to work long term? They are definitely good friends and that is a good base to start a relationship from but there is a feel of them getting together because they both happen to be single and they have history. \nChas doesn’t offer much of stress-free life and let’s not forget how things ended between them last time. Would getting together with Chas ultimately lead to Paddy losing a friend, especially at the speed relationships start and fail on this part of the Dales? \nSo, what is the answer for Paddy and his love dilemma? Go back in pursuit of Rhona and risk the wrath of Pierce or make the most of being with Chas but risk the end of a friendship if it falls apart? \nUltimately, he is probably best off without either of them – but what do you think? Does Paddy deserve a break in the romance stakes? And who with? ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:43:18.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
