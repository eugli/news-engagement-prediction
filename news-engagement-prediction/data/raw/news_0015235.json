'I am very concerned about the implications for jobs and the corporate landscape if we have seriously abandoned the idea of being members of the single market and the customs union,' she told the newspaper. Other focal points for rebels include guarantees that EU nationals already living in Britain will be allowed to stay, and ensuring there is not a 'hard' border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. However, the call for a 'meaningful vote' could prove particularly difficult for the PM as it raises the prospect that she could be sent back to Brussels to re-negotiate with a considerably weaker hand. Former chancellor Lord Lamont said Mrs May should call a general election if peers 'obstruct' the Brexit process.
