(Guadalupe Pardo/Reuters) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Saturday, February 11, 2017, 10:14 PM \nA former Peruvian leader, who has a $30,000 reward looming over his head for a corruption probe, will not be detained by U.S. authorities at a San Francisco airport, according to a report. \nEx-President Alejandro Toledo is waiting to board a United Airlines flight scheduled to leave San Francisco International Airport at around 8 p.m. for Tel Aviv. \nThe Peruvian government implored U.S. to change its mind and apprehend Toledo on an international arrest warrant, but a source told Reuters that authorities declined to honor their request. \nOn Friday, Interior Minister Carlos Basombrio expressed optimism that the U.S. would detain and extradite Toledo. \nToledo has been working as a Stanford University professor since finishing his five-year term in 2006. \nThe warrant was issued through Interpol on Thursday night. Toledo allegedly took $20 million in bribes to secure construction contracts from a Brazilian building firm. \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:31:43.608+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
