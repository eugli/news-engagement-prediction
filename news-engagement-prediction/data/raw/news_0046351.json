MAARTEN HOLL/FAIRFAX NZ \nNZ Super Fund chief executive Adrian Orr has been tipped as the next Reserve Bank Governor. \nSpeaking to media at his weekly press conference, English said the decision was \"a matter that will be taken into account when it comes to reappointment of board members\". \nREAD MORE: \n\"The Government has a view, the board's taken a different view - I think any board who takes a different view when it's 100 per cent subsidiary takes risks about tenure.\" STUFF.CO.NZ \nNZ Super Fund boss Adrian Orrâ€™s latest pay rise has raised some eyebrows. \nWhile Orr and the Super Fund had \"performed very well by world standards\", their decision to ignore the advice would need to be taken into account. \n\"The discussion we've had about the pay is no reflection on the performance of the fund or actually the professional and managerial competence of the board, but they're public entities and the Government has a view about remuneration increases.\" \nEnglish said he would prefer a more stable process for setting salaries, such as setting a level for annual increases at the start of an appointment. CAMERON BURNELL/FAIRFAX NZ. \nPrime Minister Bill English objected to Adrian Orr's 36 per cent salary increase as finance minister, saying a 2.5 per cent increase was more appropriate. \n\"There would be the opportunity to try and get a longer-term view than an annual haggle with a board who are rightly saying their chief executives are very competent, but a bit overenthusiastic about what they should be paid.\" Ad Feedback \nIn an October 2015 letter to the SSC explaining plans for a 35.6 per cent pay increase in the 2015/16 financial year, the then-Guardians of NZ Superannuation board chairman Gavin Walker said it had considered the recommended public sector pay scale, but didn't believe it was appropriate for setting Orr's salary. \n\"The highly specialist nature of the role and the organisation, [information redacted], and our anticipated recruitment challenges in replacing the incumbent's skill set require a directly meaningful and relevant, market-based benchmark against which to assess the CEO's remuneration package.\" STATE SERVICES COMMISSION \nFinance Minister Bill English states his opposition to a 35.6 per cent pay increase for NZ Super Fund chief executive Adrian Orr at the bottom of a report from the State Services Commission. \nThe Super Fund's \"sustained strong performance\", with an annual rate of return of 9.67 per cent, also had to be considered, Walker said. \nIn a response, the State Services Commissioner's office said it could not support the size of the increase. \nWhile there had been a 9.4 per cent increase in the size of Orr's job, he had already received pay increases of 25 per cent over the two previous years, including a 22 per cent increase in 2013 against the advice of the SSC and English. \nThe Government's \"ongoing expectation of restraint in the current fiscal climate\" meant a six per cent increase was more appropriate, the SSC said. \nHowever, English - in his previous role as finance minister - declined to support either the 35.6 per cent increase or the SSC's six per cent recommendation. \nIn a letter to current Guardians chairwoman Catherine Savage, he said a 35.6 per cent increase was \"too large in the current economic climate\", and believed a 2.5 per cent increase was more appropriate. \nHowever, a report from the SSC in July 2016 confirmed Orr had received the proposed 35.6 per cent increase. \nEnglish made his objections clear, writing in pen at the bottom of the report: \"If asked I will publicly state I opposed the increase. Need to discuss with the Board Chair.\" \nOrr, who oversees the $30 billion Super Fund, has been tipped as the leading candidate to replace Reserve Bank Governor Graeme Wheeler when he steps down later this year. JOHN BISSET/FAIRFAX NZ \nState Service Commissioner Peter Hughes says Adrian Orr's salary is \"significantly out of step\" with the rest of the state sector. \nSALARY 'OUT OF STEP' \nOn Monday, State Services Commissioner Peter Hughes reaffirmed the SSC's opposition to the increase, saying it was \"significantly out of step with the rest of the state sector and difficult to justify in a public organisation\". \nHughes said there needed to be more transparency about the decisions made by Crown entities like the Super Fund regarding pay increases. The SSC planned to reveal in future whether a board had followed its advice or \"chosen to act independently\" when setting salaries. \nSavage defended Orr's salary, saying it was \"fair, competitive and appropriate given the nature and complexity of the role\". \nThe 35.6 per cent increase related to Orr's potential rather than actual salary, with 60 per cent of his remuneration package \"at risk\" in the form of performance-based bonuses which he had not always received in full. \nOrr made $1.03m in the 2015/16 financial year, with a base salary of $690,322 and a bonus of $334,799. \nSALARY 'LOWER THAN INTERNATIONAL PEERS' \nSavage said Orr had done well in the role, with JP Morgan naming the NZ Super Fund in 2015 as the world's best-performing sovereign wealth fund over the last five years. \nThe board relied on external market data when setting Orr's salary, while his pay was \"not high compared to international peers\". \nHis large pay rises in recent years reflected \"a degree of catching up\", after he received no increase between October 2010 and July 2013. \nSavage said the board would look at Orr's pay increases \"with fresh eyes\" each year, but was unmoved on its opinion that market salaries were more relevant than other public sector chief executives. \n\"We are [at odds], and it's because of the uniqueness of the role ... we'll always be transparent and disclose what that pay is.\" \nSavage said it was appropriate for the Guardians board to decide Orr's pay, given its commercial independence and the design of the Super Fund. \n\"While we understand the SSC's desire to have a consistent approach to CEO remuneration across the public sector, we believe the Fund's situation, given its statutory purpose, is unique.\" \nA spokesman for English declined to comment further, saying: \"The PM's position on the increase is clear from the documentation you have.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T05:13:19.942+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
