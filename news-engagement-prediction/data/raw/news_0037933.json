Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Democrats had called on Trump to rescind Puzder's nomination, and on Wednesday CNN reported that top Senate Republicans issued a similar plea. Puzder had come under fire for employing an undocumented immigrant for several years (for which he just paid back taxes) and faced scrutiny over previous allegations that he abused his former wife. His ex-wife has since recanted those allegations. Democrats also strongly opposed Puzder's position on labor issues. Puzder, who's CEO of the company that owns fast-food chains Hardee's and Carl's Jr., is opposed to a substantial increase to the minimum wage. He's also against an Obama administration law that would expand access to overtime pay and is a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act. Most Popular He also didn't have a very high opinion of his own workforce. \"In fast food, you sort of compete for the best of the worst. In other words, you're not getting the Microsoft guys,\" he said in a speech at California State University. \"At Hardee's we were getting the worst of the worst. Nobody wanted to work at Hardee's.\" The American Prospect called Puzder \" the worst appointment imaginable \" for low-income workers and labor advocates. Puzder's demise comes at a low point for the Trump administration, which appears to be in a state of chaos after Michael Flynn, the president's national security adviser, resigned amid reports that he spoke with a Russian diplomat about U.S. foreign policy before Trump was sworn in. The New York Times also reported that several more Trump campaign staffers and confidantes communicated with Russian intelligence officials.
