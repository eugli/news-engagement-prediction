Jones, 19, was quickly arrested and charged with first-degree murder. \nLast year, Parkway Gardens was the site of another shocking murder, when a stray bullet killed Nykea Aldridge, the 32-year-old cousin of Chicago Bulls star Dwyane Wade, while she was pushing a baby stroller. \nAlso, in the 6400 block of South King Drive last year, stray bullets struck a 4-year-old in the face and a 28-year-old woman in her bed on the same night. \nAnd that’s only an inkling of the mayhem. \nIf you read the daily reports on gun violence, something soon becomes apparent. Too many shootings are happening around Parkway Gardens. \nWhy violence has been allowed to run rampant in a housing development that is listed on the National Register of Historic Places is a mystery. \nBut there are clues. \nWhile the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Chicago Housing Authority were dismantling public housing in Bronzeville and along the State Street corridor, hundreds of impoverished, low-income renters apparently moved into this historic housing complex. \nToday, all 694 units on the one-acre site are Section 8 rentals. \nParkway Gardens was built in the mid-1950s as the first cooperative owned and managed by African Americans. HUD took over the property in the ’70s and sold it to private investors. \nRelated Affordable, a division of Related Companies, and Wells Fargo & Company acquired Parkway Gardens in August 2011. The company invested $100 million in renovating the property and installed an 8,410-square-foot turf field for nearby Dulles Elementary School, according to news reports. \nThe company did not respond to phone calls for comment. \nIn 2013, Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Related Companies, then-Ald. Willie Cochran and other civic leaders attended a ribbon cutting to celebrate the grand “reopening” of Parkway Gardens Apartments. \n“As a direct result of this private partnership, here at the Parkway Gardens we are investing in a path to a brighter future for our children that starts with a supportive home,” Emanuel said then. \nObviously, no one anticipated that the same social ills that made public housing unlivable for so many would develop at this housing complex. \nAccording to the records kept by the Illinois secretary of state, Parkway Gardens Residents Council dissolved in 1994, and the Parkway Gardens Tenant Association dissolved involuntarily in 2016. \nOf course, not everyone in Parkway Gardens is involved in criminal behavior. The horrendous crime against Takiya would not have been solved had concerned residents refused to step up. But violent disputes between rival gangs are a fact of life in Parkway Gardens. \nAnd the owners of this property are not being held accountable. \nWhy is that?
