'Stereotypes' \nBut research author, Dr Alex Baratta of the Manchester Institute of Education, points out that the guidelines do not cover the issue of accents, questioning whether it is an area that is \"too controversial\" or \"too complex\" to address. \nTwo of the nine teachers in his study admitted to \"consciously modifying\" their accent in preparation for a teaching career. \nA teacher from Bristol explained why he changed the way he spoke. \n\"The Bristolian accent has lots of connotations,\" he said. \n\"Normally, things like village idiot, yokel, farmer, you know, friendly, but stupid ... agricultural ... so because of that once I came into contact with people that had softer accents and accents from elsewhere. \n\"You have these kind of stereotypes that exist and it wasn't doing me any favours.\" 'Tug of war' \nAnother, from Salford, told how she had toned down her accent so as to be \"a model for the girls\" in the private school in which she worked. \nHer change was also based on making her accent more like those of her pupils, which \"while regional to Manchester, were certainly not broad\" she said. \nThe author also gave the example of an art teacher with a \"quite strong\" south London accent, who was asked to write the word \"water\" with a capital T, to remind her to pronounce it. \nAnd yet nearly all teachers and students involved in the study felt they should be free to speak in their regional accents. \nHowever, Dr Baratta suggested some teachers faced a \"potential tug of war\" because of the way their particular accent is viewed and felt a pressure to change the way they spoke. \n\"While there may be a desire to be true to one's linguistic roots,\" he said, \"people might have to consider this desire against the potential for the negative connotations of one's accent, within a profession in which such stereotypes might seem incompatible.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:29:45.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
