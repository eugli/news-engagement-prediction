ITV West Cumberland Hospital \nBut neither the fate of the hospital or wider A&E pressures feature in leaflets or questionnaires distributed by local Tory candidate Trudy Harrison and her team. \nA new Ipsos-MORI/Economist poll found that public concern over the NHS has risen to its highest level since 2003, with almost half (49%) of Britons considering it to be one of the biggest issues facing the country. \nThe Tories have instead focused on nuclear power, Brexit, rural broadband, schools and flood defences as campaign themes. The NHS does not feature in any of their six ‘’pledges” to local people. \nThe by-election, which was triggered after Labour MP Jamie Reed quit to take a job in the nearby Sellafield nuclear waste centre, will take place on February 23 at the same time as the Stoke-on-Trent Central poll. HuffPost The Tory 'Six Pledges' leaflet \nAndrew Gwynne MP, Labour’s National Elections and Campaigns coordinator, told HuffPost UK: “To make six pledges to a remote constituency on the verge of losing vital services from its hospitals, and not mention it, is incredulous. \n“The Tories don’t have any answers and so have chosen to simply airbrush it out of the picture. They clearly don’t have any real understanding of what’s going on in Copeland.” \nThe Prime Minister told Reed last year that there was “a general consensus” among medical experts that services should be downgraded at West Cumberland Hospital. HuffPost A Tory questionnaire in Copeland. \nOnce the by-election was called, May appeared to backtrack, saying in Prime Minister’s Question time that “I recognise the concerns” about the loss of consultant-led maternity cover in the constituency. \nAn eight-year old girl who was born in the hospital has yet to receive a reply from the PM to a letter urging her to intervene and stop the cuts. \nGillian Troughton, Labour’s candidate in the by-election, added: “The Tories are in denial about the dangerous impact their cuts to West Cumberland Hospital will have on our community. \n“Their plans to downgrade West Cumberland’s maternity wing, close the A&E and remove the children’s ward, plus proposals to remove inpatient beds at Keswick, are the number one concerns of people I talk to.” Danny Lawson/PA Wire Jeremy Corbyn visits staff at West Cumberland Hospital \nWith nuclear power the main employer in the area, the Tories have deliberately targeted Jeremy Corbyn’s changing views on the issue over the years. \nAfter weeks of prevarication, the Labour leader recently pledged to back a new power station at Moorside, on which 20,000 jobs depend. \nBut the entire project has been thrown into doubt after Japanese firm Toshiba appeared on Tuesday to pull out of a consortium to build it. \nChris Jukes, GMB Senior Officer for Sellafield and Cumbria said he wanted May to use her visit to Copeland “to make concrete commitments that the government will take any necessary stake in Moorside to keep this vital piece of infrastructure on track and which will fill any future gaps in funding.” \nA hustings for the by-election candidates is set to be held on Wednesday night, hosted by trade unions GMB and Unite.
