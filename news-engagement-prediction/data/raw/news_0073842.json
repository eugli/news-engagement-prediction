While her man has a cameo in the big-screen project, Kirsten admitted that she doesn't really need to direct him because he's so good and talented. \nAnd if you're wondering how Jesse feels about having Kirsten as his boss, he's certainly not bothered. \"That's okay,\" he told us. \nKirsten and Jesse kept their relationship mostly under wraps until they were spotted kissing in May of 2016. \nThe actress would later show off her gorgeous engagement ring at the Palm Springs Film Festival this year.
