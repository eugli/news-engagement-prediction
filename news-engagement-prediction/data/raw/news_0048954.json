Our team of experts have been doing their homework in a bid to point you in the direction of the winning formula. Will Manchester City overcome Monaco, are Leicester capable of putting their domestic woes behind them and can Bayer Leverkusen stun Atletico Madrid? Read on for our thoughts on these ties and some intriguing games in the Europa League. Bayer Leverkusen vs. Atletico Madrid 2 of 7 Denis Doyle/Getty Images On paper, Atletico Madrid have to be considered heavy favourites in their Champions League round-of-16 tie with Bayer Leverkusen, who are a disappointing eighth in the Bundesliga table after 21 rounds of matches. However, Los Colchoneros have often struggled more than anticipated against supposedly inferior opposition in Europe's premier competitions, having to rely on penalty shootouts to make it out of the last 16 in the two previous campaigns. One of those shootout wins came against Leverkusen, who are a much stronger side than in March 2015 thanks to additions such as Chicharito and Kevin Kampl, and the continued emergence of Karim Bellarabi and Julian Brandt. That said, Leverkusen have been inconsistent this season and seem to alternate between impressive results (a 3-0 win over high-flying Monaco in the group stage comes to mind) and inexplicable duds. Which of Bayer's two faces will show up should go a long way in deciding their chances in the tie with an Atletico team that seems to not have the same edge to it one has come to expect from a Diego Simeone side. Given their recent uptick in performances in the Bundesliga, a home win for Leverkusen would not be too surprising.
