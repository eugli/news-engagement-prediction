She and fellow classmate, Jacqueline Carverhill, created Grits for Grieving Guys with the help of the Saskatchewan Medical Association.\nAccording to Carverhill, the pair decided to make a five-week program that mixed their interest in geriatric care and their love for cooking.\n\"I think the value of the group was that we were able to bring five men together around cooking a meal but were also able to discuss commonalities and differences,\" Hedemann added.\nRandy Nelson was one of the most recent participants.\nNelson met his wife Isabel nearly 70 years ago in Saskatoon. Last year, she passed away, and that's when the 90-year-old was approached by the Saskatoon Funeral Home about the class.\n\"They advised me to take it and I thought, well, I might even learn how to cook a little bit,\" Nelson added.\nHe said he had mastered the art of the peanut butter sandwich but was open to learning more.\n\"I think most people would be surprised with the amount of laughter that was there,\" he noted. \"I think that was a great help for us.\"\nNelson said now that he has a few more recipes under his belt, he plans to try out some of his new skills on his friends.\nWith files from CBC Radio's Saskatoon Morning", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T21:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:40:33.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
