They scored 33 points and took their first lead since the opening quarter.

So can you make it difficult on them? Can you make all their baskets tough? In a perfect world, you get the ball out of their hands some. But it’s easier said then done.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T12:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:13:24.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
