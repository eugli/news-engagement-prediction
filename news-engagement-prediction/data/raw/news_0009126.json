It’s made of cardboard,” he said. \n“This is not something they should ever have been in. I know you don’t expect to be in an accident, but you have to plan for it,” said Teresa Richardson, Megan’s mother. \nThe families say they’re focusing on preventing further tragedy. \n“If anything good can come out of our children’s deaths, maybe these things will be made safer or just taken off the road,” said Pelton. \nCBS11 reached out to Champion Bus, but has not received a response. \n  Andrea Lucia facebook Follow Andrea joined CBS 11 and TXA 21 in September 2010, one day before a tornado swept through the area.
