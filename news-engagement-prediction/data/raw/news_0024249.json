The Washington Post reported that another conversion by that rabbi was rejected.\nHowever, due to some guideline changes after Trump won the election, Ivanka is now officially recognized as Jewish.\n(Story continues below.)\nJared Kushner is the husband of future first daughter Ivanka Trump and a close confidant of her father, President-elect Donald Trump. Here are some things to know about him. Kushner is a New York real estate developer and CEO of a company started by his father. In 2007, at the age of just 26, Kushner purchased a Manhattan office tower, 666 Fifth Avenue, for what was then a record $1.8 billion. Kushner owns The New York Observer newspaper. He met Ivanka Trump over a business lunch. They married on October 25, 2009, in a Jewish ceremony. She converted to Judaism for him. Then-U.S. Atty. Chris Christie prosecuted Charles Kushner on felony charges of witness tampering, illegal campaign donations and tax evasion. After a plea deal, Charles Kushner spent 14 months in federal prison. Jared Kushner is widely suspected of being behind the demotion of Christie on the transition team.\nMedia: Wibbitz Though chief rabbis say they guidelines were not changed because of the election results, many critics beg to differ.\n\"It would definitely be embarrassing to the State of Israel and for the rabbinate if the Jewish family like Ivanka Trump's family was to visit Israel and for the official Jewish authorities in Israel to not recognize their Judaism,\" Elad Kaplan of ITIM, a group that represents Jewish converts in Israel, told USA TODAY .\nDespite the controversy, Trump and her husband have long been known for keeping kosher and the Sabbath. Although they received special permission to break the strict observance of the Sabbath for her father's inauguration.\nTake a look through the gallery above to see other things you probably didn't know about Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.", "external_links": ["http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/42/62/74/9121551/3/920x920.jpg",
