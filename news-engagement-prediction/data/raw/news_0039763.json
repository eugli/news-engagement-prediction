North Tyneside is a great place to live, work and visit, and in partnership with the police our resolve is to keep it that way.”\nResidents guilty of antisocial behaviour face eviction if they continue to blight their community (Photo: Newcastle Chronicle) As well as speaking to perpetrators, the team delivered letters to neighbouring residents advising them of the action taken and encouraging them to report any further anti-social behaviour they witness.\nActing Inspector Guy Morgan said: “Antisocial behaviour is an issue that law Northumbria Police takes very seriously due to the major impact it can have on individuals and communities. Working with the community protection team, North Tyneside Council and other partners, we aim to protect our communities.\n“Operation Respect allows us to pro-actively deal with tenants who cause problems within the community.\n“Tenants need to realise the impact of their behaviour on others and understand that they could risk losing their homes if they act in an antisocial way. The joint visits we carried out should serve as a warning that we will take swift action against anyone who continues to engage in antisocial behaviour.”\n  Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily   Guy Morgan Northumbria Police Crime Burglary Injunctions Shoplifting Neighbours from hell", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T15:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T11:51:09.056+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
