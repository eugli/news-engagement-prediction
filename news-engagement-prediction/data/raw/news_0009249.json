Trump orders revival of Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines Read more \nThe acting secretary of the army has directed the army corps of engineers to proceed with an easement necessary to finish the pipeline, Don Canton, spokesman for Hoeven, told the Associated Press. The easement “isn’t quite issued yet, but they plan to approve it” within days, he added. \nA spokesman for the US army did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nJan Hasselman, lawyer representing the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, cautioned in an email that the battle wasn’t over. “People are jumping the gun, no easement has been issued,” he said, adding that he had confirmed that with the justice department. \nBut Hasselman added: “I’d say it’s a near certainty that they go ahead. It will be illegal of them to do so, of course, so [we] will have to litigate that.” Trump signs order reviving controversial pipeline projects \nIn a statement released Tuesday night, the tribe said it would “vigorously pursue legal action to ensure the environmental impact statement order issued late last year is followed so the pipeline process is legal, fair and accurate”. \nThe Standing Rock tribe, supported by indigenous activists and environmental groups across the globe, has long argued that the $3.8bn project threatens sacred lands and the regional water supply. Standing Rock Sioux: 'we can't back down now' on Dakota pipeline fight Read more \nIn his first week in office, Trump issued an executive order demanding the revival of the Dakota Access pipeline and the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, both of which Barack Obama had halted. The tribe vowed to fight the order , which it said is illegal and not backed by proper consultation with Standing Rock. \nThough many activists left Standing Rock after Obama denied the company’s permits in December, some have remained camped out by the construction site through the harsh North Dakota winter. \nIrina Lukban, a 22-year-old activists who is at Standing Rock, said that word about the easement had not spread through camp yet on Tuesday night. \n“It’s not too surprising, but it’s still really upsetting, especially with all the other tensions rising with the immigration ban,” she said, referencing Trump’s travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries . \n“We can’t give up. We can’t lose hope,” she added. “The resistance is still alive.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T10:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:07:13.514+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
