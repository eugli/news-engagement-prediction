They run, jump, throw balls, and do balance training to develop their physical movement skills. \nBy developing those core fundamental movements while also working on perfecting their curling skills, Johnson said the kids will become strong athletes overall. \nREAD MORE: Moncton to host national under-18 curling championships \n“If we understand how the children develop we have a much better chance of keeping them active and ultimately to have high level athletes even in small provinces.” \nThe physical literacy program, Johnson said, is similar to the ones used at more advanced training centres in European countries. \nThe goal he said is also to build confidence in children who may not see themselves as potential competitors. \n“We know in particular that after the age of 11 or 12 that kids turns away from sports because they see themselves as not being competent and when you are not good at something it is very difficult to stay motivated,” Johnson said. \nPerron added confidence can lead to longevity. \n“If a child is more confident within themselves they are going to continue with some sport or some sports,” Perron said. \nHe said he hopes the new program will also help encourage more kids to try curling, which he said has seen declining interest across the country for the past 10 years. \n“I think it will turn out more skilled people and more skilled athletes in general,” he said. \nThe New Brunswick Curling Association has applied for a $25,000 provincial grant to fund the program and hopes to eventually expand the physical literary program to 27 curling clubs across the province. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
