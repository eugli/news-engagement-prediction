Rec Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images The Cleveland Browns released veteran wide receiver Andrew Hawkins on Monday, in what was a mutual decision between the team and Hawkins. He had been with the Browns since 2014. Prior to his tenure with the Browns, Hawkins spent three seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals . Between the Browns and the Bengals, Hawkins hasn’t done too much winning, and it’s one of the reasons he wanted to be released: The Browns and Andrew Hawkins have talked the last few weeks. He made the hard call to ask for his release. Wants to chase a championship. — Albert Breer (@AlbertBreer) February 27, 2017 Hawkins played in 16 games this season, starting in five of them. He improved off of an injury-filled 2015 season, and had his second most touchdown receptions of his career with three. Yet he still only put up 324 yards receiving. Hawkins talked about his release on the UNINTERRUPTED Twitter account, thanking the Browns. He also said that he felt they paved the way for future success. \"As of today, I am officially a former Cleveland Brown.\" — @hawk pic.twitter.com/b0iGEv0lmL — UNINTERRUPTED (@uninterrupted) February 27, 2017 In their release , the Browns were very appreciative of Hawkins’ three seasons with the team. Browns coach Hue Jackson spoke highly of Hawkins, saying, “It's tough to say goodbye to men like Hawk, that have done everything you've asked of them and gone above and beyond when it comes to leadership.” Jackson added, “Hawk was a rock for us last season. He kept our locker room together and led by example as he gave everything he had on the field.” It wasn’t just about his on the field play, though. “The well-intended work he did in the Cleveland community was greatly appreciated and the respect he earned throughout our league for never being afraid to responsibly create an educated dialogue around a societal issue is commendable,” Executive Vice President of Football Operations Sashi Brown said. During the 2016 season, Hawkins, along with other NFL players, went to Washington D.C. to discuss police brutality and issues related to race with members of Congress. Hawkins was also appreciative of his teammates. “Thank you to my incredible teammates for allowing me the opportunity to be one of your captains, it was an honor to battle with you, week in and week out,” Hawkins said. “And lastly, thank you Cleveland Browns fans, you are one of the best fanbases in all of the world.” Playing for the Browns isn’t easy, but Hawkins seemed to genuinely enjoy his time there — making it as fun as he possibly could . “No matter where I play next, I will always be part of the Browns family,” Hawkins said. Though he’s no longer a member of the team, Hawkins is optimistic about the future of the Browns. “Be optimistic because Hue Jackson is one of the best coaches in all of football,” he said in his video with UNINTERRUPTED. “I know you guys have an incredible future ahead of you.” As far as Hawkins goes, any future success with him depends on who picks him up this offseason.
