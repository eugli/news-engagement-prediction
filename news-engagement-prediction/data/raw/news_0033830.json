A few months after dropping \" Don't Wanna Know \" with Kendrick Lamar, the band has released \"Cold,\" which boasts a featured verse from Future . \n\"Cold\" takes a decidedly darker tone than \"Don't Wanna Know,\" layering Adam Levine's vocals over a minimal, bass-heavy beat. Even Future's delivery is slowed down from his usual clip. \nThen again, it's a song about falling rapidly out of love released just in time for Valentine's Day. You can't fault Future and Adam for sounding a little bummed out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T20:26:51.085+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
