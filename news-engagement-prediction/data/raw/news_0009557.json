Mike Pence as his running mate worried activists.\nPence has championed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act while serving as governor of Indiana, which said that the government could not 'burden a person's exercise of religion.'\nProgressives feared that would permit lawful discrimination of LGBTQ citizens.\nThat wound was still open as Pence made his way to Washington.\nWhen he and his family temporarily moved into the tony, liberal, neighborhood of Chevy Chase, neighbors flew rainbow flags as a way to protest the social conservative and support the LGTBQ community.\nAdditionally, during the week of inauguration, activists held a 'queer dance party' outside his rented home.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-01-31T15:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T15:39:54.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
