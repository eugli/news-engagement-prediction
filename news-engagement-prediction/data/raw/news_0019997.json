Police ruled out the possibility of a terrorist attack and said the man acted alone. Investigators were looking into his mental condition. \nVideo footage showed chaos on the platform of the packed Tsim Sha Tsui station, with a train carriage on fire and one man lying on the floor with his clothes ablaze as bystanders tried to help. Television news showed people with burn injuries as emergency personnel carried out rescue operations. \n“I heard loud cries and the smell of the fumes didn’t smell like a normal fire – it had a chemical smell,” an eyewitness identified as Mr Chow told reporters at the scene. “Once I inhaled it, it burned the throat,” Chow said, adding that people were rushing out of the station.

SCMP had earlier reported the man tried to light a Molotov cocktail and said “burn you to death” before he took out the bottle. \nLocal media said the suspect was also in critical condition but police would not confirm it. \nThe Tsim Sha Tsui station, which services a popular shopping and nightlife district, was evacuated following the incident with trains skipping the station on Friday night. It was reopened on Saturday morning. \nThe incident is a rare occurrence in the Asian finance hub where the transport network is known for its safety and efficiency. \nIn 2004 14 people were injured when a man started a fire in the subway’s Admiralty station during the morning rush hour.
