Good on ya boys for giving it a go,” the banner read. \nBut perhaps the Dogs saved their best work until the second sentence. — Western Bulldogs (@westernbulldogs) February 18, 2017 \nIn a first for footy, the Dogs-Dees men’s pre-season game was a curtain-raiser to the main event, which will be the AFLW clash between the same two clubs. \nAnd the work of the Dogs’ cheersquad undoubtedly would’ve brought a smile to the face of Murphy and his teammates as they read the second line. \n“But seriously, get off before the real match starts!” \nBrilliant. Well played, Dogs. \nEven coach Luke Beveridge got into the jovial spirit pre-game. \n“Yeah it’s great a pretty big crowd for a curtain-raiser too,” Beveridge joked to Fox Footy . Great banner. Nice nod to the #AFLW match on here later. pic.twitter.com/QTBqAFx3bs — Lauren Wood (@LaurenA_Wood) February 18, 2017 \nIt’s been a quick and much-needed recovery for the Bulldogs’ cheersquad, who got off to a rough start in the AFLW season. \nBanner mastermind Danny McGinlay revealed the club’s cheersquad still had a “premiership hangover” come the club’s first AFLW game against Fremantle. \n“On our first women’s game, the banner was supposed to say: ‘Our sons of the west have proven their best, rejoice now supporters we will unleash the daughters’ — you know, cute little thing, ‘sons of the west, daughters of the west’,” McGinlay told Triple M . \n“Already a little stuff up: The cheersquad accidentally put ‘our boys of the west have proven their best’. It just ruined the joke.” \nGreat recovery, team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:12:56.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
