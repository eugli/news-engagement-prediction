The Prime Minister said the Opposition leader didn’t have a “fair dinkum bone in him” when he fronted media in Canberra today to spruik the Government’s social welfare omnibus bill. Mr Turnbull said reaction to his speech in Parliament where he called Mr Shorten a social-climbing sycophant rang true because the Labor leader was a fake. \n“He wants to play the politics of envy and yet he’s been a sycophant to the billionaires of Melbourne for years and years, everyone knows that,” Mr Turnbull said. \n“Those criticisms rang true. \n“The people who know him best are his own colleagues, they know he is a fake, he has no integrity, he has no consistency. \n“He doesn’t have a fair dinkum bone in him.” media_camera Malcolm Turnbull said Bill Shorten doesn’t have what it takes to be the Prime Minister of Australia. Picture: AAP/Lukas Coch \nMr Turnbull’s savage attack in Question Time has been compared to infamous sledges by former Prime Minister Paul Keating and former Prime Minister Julia Gillard’s misogyny speech. \nAsked whether he would continue the personal attacks even if Mr Shorten laid off the “Mr Harbour-side mansion” comments, Mr Turnbull said politics was “about character”. \n“Bill Shorten does not have the character to be Prime Minister of Australia,” he said. \n“Bill Shorten has made the case for reducing company tax as eloquently as anyone. \n“He will say anything to suit his purpose.” \nDeputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce thoroughly enjoyed Mr Turnbull’s spray and joined in this morning. \n“(Mr Shorten) couldn’t run a pie shop and the thought of him running the country just fills me with dread,” he told ABC. \nMr Joyce said if he had a choice between someone running the country with “the arse out of their pants who has never made a buck” or someone who had actually got ahead, he’d back the latter. \n“He might be leader of the Labor Party but it looks like you’ve never done a day’s labour in your life,” Mr Joyce told ABC radio of the Labor leader. \n“We’re not going to have Mr Shorten going out there, bucketing on us and just keep on taking it on the chin everyday.” Shorten responds to Turnbull's tirade 0:33 \nLabor leader Bill Shorten responds to Malcolm Turnbull's angry verbal tirade against him.
