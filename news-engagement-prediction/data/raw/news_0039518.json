Mallory McCree in “From Nowhere.” Credit FilmRise Given the deepening dread and uncertainty over immigration issues, “From Nowhere,” Matthew Newton’s wrenching, if somewhat chaotic, film about undocumented high school students in the Bronx could hardly be more pertinent. It’s one thing to read about roundups of suspected illegal immigrants; it’s quite another to observe the anxiety of smart, talented teenagers trying to keep their cool while under the watchful gaze of immigration officials and the police. In his director’s statement, Mr. Newton declares that he didn’t set out to make a political film. But recent government actions lend a painful urgency to these interwoven stories. With the fear of deportation hanging over their heads, these adolescents are forced to weigh major life decisions at an age when their American-born peers are fretting about the already stressful challenges of dating and getting into college. “From Nowhere” focuses on three promising students whose caring teacher Jackie ( Julianne Nicholson ) has arranged for them to meet with an immigration lawyer (Denis O’Hare) who is working pro bono to help them achieve political asylum before they graduate. To bolster their cases, he asks them to supply detailed evidence of the horrors they fled. Asylum is more likely to be granted if their histories involved genocide, genital mutilation or a dictatorship. The most promising student is Moussa (J. Mallory McCree), whose frightened mother (Chinasa Ogbuagu) brought the family from Guinea to the United States to live with a man who subsequently abandoned them. Now the family is behind in the rent and facing eviction. Video A preview of the film. By FilmRISE on Publish Date February 16, 2017. Photo by FilmRise. Watch in Times Video » embed Bitter, cynical Sophie (Octavia Chavez-Richmond) is from the Dominican Republic and lives with an uncle who treats her as a household slave in an extended family where he resents her presence (another mouth to feed). Because his beer-drinking buddies make surreptitious passes at her when they come over to watch sports, she trusts no one, and her rage threatens to boil over. Her defensive hauteur leads her fellow students to think she is crazy. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The bright, peppy, Peruvian-born Alyssa (Raquel Castro), the class valedictorian, has the most difficulty compiling evidence for the lawyer, and is also the least developed character. The tensions among these boisterous teenagers are palpable in scenes of their being stopped on the street at night by the police and interrogated, and at a post-prom party that threatens to erupt into a brawl. Even among the faculty members, the atmosphere is so tense that Jackie is taken aside by a superior and questioned about her possibly inappropriate relationship with Moussa. “From Nowhere” culminates in a celebratory graduation ceremony. But by this time excruciating choices have been made, and the uncertain future of a student who chooses to leave the country gives the film an underlying sadness. Their ordeal feels cruel, unnecessary and infuriatingly real. “How could I think I had anything to teach these kids about reality?” a disheartened Jackie muses in a final conversation with the lawyer, during which she learns which student has the best chance of receiving asylum. “They could teach me about reality.” From Nowhere", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:52:30.376+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
