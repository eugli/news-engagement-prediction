The initial period after the Jan Dhan scheme was unveiled saw fierce competition among banks to open such accounts. It may not be surprising if someone is found to have more than one Jan Dhan account,\" said Janak Rawal, general secretary , MahaGujarat Bank Employees Association. The income tax department has also issued more than 5,100 notices across India for verification of cash deposits in bank accounts, including Jan Dhan accounts.

If we receive any information about individual account, we will verify it for sure. But as such we have not started any inquiry into Jan Dhan accounts.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:36:32.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
