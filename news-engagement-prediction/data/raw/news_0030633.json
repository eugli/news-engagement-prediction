The terrorist thriller eerily anticipated the Berlin Christmas Market attack in December. \nIndependent distributor NFP, fresh off the success of Oscar nominee Toni Erdmann , has picked up German thriller Berlin Falling , the directorial debut of actor Ken Duken, for Germany. \nThe film, which Duken shot last year, follows a terrorist who hijacks a car and forces the driver to take him to Berlin where, in the middle of Christmas celebrations, he plans to carry out a brutal attack. The plot is frighteningly similar to the real-life attack in Berlin on Dec. 19, when a terrorist hijacked a truck and drove into the crowd at a Berlin Christmas market, killing 12 people. \nDuken, a major German TV star who's had supporting roles in films including Max Manus and Inglourious Basterds , stars as Frank, the hapless driver of the hijacked car. Tom Wlaschiha, known to Game of Thrones fans as the face-shifting assassin Jaqen H'ghar, plays Andreas, his tormentor. \nDuken came up with the idea for a thriller centered around a Berlin terror attack nearly two years ago and developed the script together with Christoph Mille and Norbert Kneissl. The movie was financed by pay TV giant Sky's Sky Deutschland unit. \nIn an uncanny case of synchronicity, Duken first screened the movie for cast and crew on Dec. 19, in a theater just a few blocks from Breitscheidplatz, where the attack took place. \nBerlin Falling is eyeing a festival debut later this year.
