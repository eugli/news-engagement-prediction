A motorist who was convicted over reckless driving and driving under the influence of drugs has appealed the Dh30,000 fine handed to him by court. Official court documents stated that the Emirati man was stopped by cops on one of Abu Dhabi roads after he was spotted driving recklessly. And when police checked his urine sample, he tested positive for drugs. Prosecutors said the man was consuming tramadol, a prescription-only medicine and without permission from a doctor. Abu Dhabi Criminal Court of First instance had fined him Dh10,000 for consuming tramadol and another Dh20,000 for reckless driving and driving under the influence of drugs. The man however challenged the sentences in the appeal court. And during a hearing on Sunday, he admitted to using tramadol but denied he was driving when police caught him. \"Police found me in Khalidiya area when I had parked my car when they arrested me,\" the Emirati told the Appeal Court. \"I wasn't driving at that time.\" The man pleaded to the judge to be lenient on him and give him a lighter sentence. The trial was adjourned until March 12. Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T14:12:20.894+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
