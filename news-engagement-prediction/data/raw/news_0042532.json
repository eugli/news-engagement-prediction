Yet success came only after Monaco relinquished their pursuit of high-profile stars and turned back to their academy, defined by limited resources and patient work in a city famous for glitz and wealth. \nThe statistics are beyond expectations. With 59 points and 76 goals scored, Leonardo Jardim’s men not only occupy pole position in the title race but are the most devastating attack on the continent. There are no superstars in this line-up, names like Valère Germain or Kylian Mbappé have only just started reverberating around Europe, yet have been famous for a long time at La Turbie, Monaco’s academy. \nMonaco are finally challenging Paris Saint-Germain for the Ligue 1 title this season and a transfer between both clubs last summer goes a long way in explaining it, yet had nothing to do with a player. Bertrand Reuzeau, one of the most reputed youth coaches in France, was appointed academy director last June after 11 years with PSG. For someone credited with bringing through the youngsters who dismantled Barcelona last week, he keeps a low profile in describing his new influence. \n“Everything here already worked well before my arrival,” he concedes. To understand that statement, it is necessary to understand the peculiar microstate where Monaco was founded. \nImported from England to France’s northern shores at the start of last century, football reached Monaco only in the 1920s and it took four decades for the side to register some success in 1961, the season when their iconic jersey designed by Grace Kelly, princess of Monaco, was first introduced. \nThe principality’s tiny population, mostly consisting in foreign residents, never really was interested in its flagship club and its 18,000-seat stadium, large enough to host half of the city’s inhabitants, was often left empty. Monegasque citizens, forbidden from accessing the Monte Carlo Casino’s gaming rooms, were heavily encouraged to watch football at Stade Louis II but interest hardly took off. \nThe lowest average attendance in France translated to perennially weak matchday and merchandising revenues. The principality was wealthy but the football club suffered from insufficient resources. As the club wallowed between first and second league, a new president arrived in 1975, setting out to follow the examples of Sochaux and Nantes, successful clubs with their own academy. The French football federation had founded its first national institute for young prospects, and ASM president Jean-Louis Campora hired the institute’s head coach Gerard Banide to create an academy in a former quarry, a few miles inland from the Mediterranean seafront. \nA subsequent consequence of the principality’s demography was the absence of a local population from which to pick youngsters, so the academy could not offer the same early schooling as other French clubs. “There are not enough kids playing football in the area, so we do not have grassroots teams from under-nine upwards like elsewhere,” says Reuzeau, explaining the legacy he inherited. “Our graduates join aged 15 from national institutes like INF Clairefontaine and we only pick a dozen when other clubs pick up to 30.” The Stade Louis II perched in Monaco.

Yet this became a strength rather than a weakness, forcing the club to scout for the best players and strengthen its scouting network around France when other clubs developed their international scope. \nAlthough the principality is nominally independent from France, Monaco needed French national centres to thrive. Arsène Wenger joined in 1987 and honed his talent development skills, bringing in the likes of Lilian Thuram, Thierry Henry and Emmanuel Petit. \nThe club successfully made up for the absence of younger teams. By taking more time to select players, Monaco could make sure prospective new candidates were adequate. “The players who join us spent their youth with their families,” Reuzeau explains. “We start talking to them aged 12 or 13 and use the delay as a strength, since youngsters can remain in their environment of origin longer before joining.” \nPresidents, coaches and players came and went but this philosophy still yields results today. Although he snubbed Arsenal last summer,Mbappé today walks in the footsteps of Henry, having both graduated from national centre at Clairefontaine before moving to the French Riviera to complete their formation. “When we speak to top talents, they believe in our project because of the youth that is visible across the first team,” says Reuzeau. \nMonaco are Ligue 1 leaders with the third youngest side in the league, led by the second youngest coach. As a consequence of this careful approach, academy graduates join at a later age but they tend to stay later too. World Cup winners Henry, Thuram and Petit joined aged 15 and completed at least 100 league games each before moving abroad. The new wave of Mbappé, forward Thomas Lemar and midfielder Tiemoué Bakayoko has been grabbing headlines this season. All have attracted interest from Manchester City, who they face this Tuesday, but their academy director does not seem too worried. “We only have to show them statistics of French players who left early to go to England, that generally does the trick,” Reuzeau says. Five priorities of the Monaco academy \nScouting: “What I learnt during my time at Monaco is that the club had the best youth scouting network in France,” says Tor-Kristian Karlsen, the first sporting director to serve the current owners. “Players down to the age of 11 or 12 were tracked all over the country. They have highly qualified scouts in all the regions and the identification process is probably the single most important factor in the work of an academy.” \nDiversity: “We want different profiles for one position, to avoid creating direct competition for every spot,” Reuzeau explains. “When the talents arrive at La Turbie, there are excellent coaches to work on improving their skills as footballers and development of human beings. The support network is also first class,” adds Karlsen. \nSpecialisation: Academy graduates learn the basics of possession game and transitional game, playing in various positions until the under-17 team when they specialise in one position. The best academy players are mixed with seasoned professionals in the B team which plays in France’s fourth tier, the highest amateur division. \nOff the pitch evaluation: “We often refuse to approach prospects with a poor record outside the pitch and try to groom the individuals as well as the players,” says Reuzeau. “Each academy graduate undertakes associative work to understand people of the same age who live in different conditions.” \nBig data: “Clubs all have similar data on their players, but we try to differentiate ourselves in the way we present it to players. Our academy graduates provide feedback on their training loads,” says Reuzeau. “We give them technical analysis of their games within 48 hours of the final whistle and a mobile application is developed to access their data from their smartphone.” Five academy players to watch \n• Loïc Badiashile (goalkeeper, France U18) \n• Franco Antonucci (winger, Belgium U17) \n• Adrien Bongiovanni (winger, Belgium U17) \n• Irvin Cardona (striker, France U20) \n• Moussa Sylla (striker, France U18)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:06:17.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
