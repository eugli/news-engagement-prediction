The latter then climbed over the railings and was seen attempting to wash his hands in the river.\n\"Ten minutes later, I heard a 'plop' sound and when I turned around, he (Suhaimi) was nowhere to be seen. I ran over but the water was murky and I could not see much,\" Liu said.\nThe Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said it was alerted to a rescue incident at around 2.45pm.\nIt conducted surface search operations and deployed two pairs of divers, who recovered Suhaimi's body of the man from the river at around 4.30pm.\nHe was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.\nSuhaimi's close friend, 61-year-old Kamrudin, told Wanbao they had arranged to meet for one of their regular chats in the area, which they had fond memories of as they grew up there.\n\"At the time of the incident, I had left him alone for awhile to buy drinks. By the time I returned, there were lots of police officers and I found out he had fallen into the river,\" said Kamrudin.\nSCDF also dispatched a fire engine, two fire bikes, a Red Rhino, an ambulance and a support vehicle to the scene.\nA police spokesman said investigations into the unnatural death are ongoing. â€“ The Straits Times/Asia News Network", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T10:13:17.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
