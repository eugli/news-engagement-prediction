The moment @denis_shapo hit the chair umpire in the face, resulting in a default and Win for Great Britain. I'm in shock. #DavisCup pic.twitter.com/8nawleuac7 \nNow, not only did Shapovalov concede his own match, but he also lost his country the entire tie. His default gifted the Brits a 3-2 victory and thus safe passage into the quarter-finals of the Davis Cup. \nUnderstandably, the youngster was distraught. \nAfter hitting the defenceless umpire, Shapovalov showed immediate remorse and went over to try and make sure his victim was OK, but such niceties were never going to save him. He knew his fate, and he skulked back to his courtside seat and buried his face in his hands, barely able to comprehend what he’d done. media_camera It can’t get much worse for Denis Shapovalov. \nCanadian fans booed, but there was no way Shapovalov was ever going to get away with this act of petulance. \nGabas too cradled his face in his hands, no doubt in shock from the missile. He had to ice his eye afterwards. media_camera", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:11:46.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
