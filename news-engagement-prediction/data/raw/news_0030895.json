Periods are the great equalizer of womankind: We (mostly) all get ‘em. So, why are we so ashamed to talk about it? That’s the question that drove yoga instructor Steph Góngora to Instagram last week, in which she flows through a series of difficult yoga poses while bleeding through her white leggings. Góngora wanted to start a conversation about menstruation and inspire women to cast aside their period shame, but, as she tells Cosmopolitan.com , she knew she needed to do something shocking for people to take notice. She explains: “I knew a bright red blood spot on pristine white pants would make a statement in a society that rarely takes the time to actually read—that catching people’s eye with something a little more shocking might be necessary to snap them out of their social media scrolling.” You May Also Like Lifestyle Nordstrom's Korean Beauty Pop-Up Shop: Everything You Need To Know Góngora says her goal in creating the viral video was not only to start a conversation, but to encourage women to cast aside the shame bred by the \"hundreds of years of culture' that have left us “feeling dirty and ashamed” of menstruation. Captioning the video (which, as of today, has been viewed nearly 250,000 times on Instagram alone), the bold yogi writes, “Stop wasting so much effort hiding the very thing that gives this species continuity. Educate your daughters. Make them understand that [periods] can be both an inconvenience and a gift, but NEVER something to be ashamed about.” More stories for that time of the month:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T20:54:57.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
