Picture: George Salpigtidis \nJust one week away from their round one clash with Brisbane at Shark Park, Lee, 24, is an important addition to the Cronulla backline depth, which is already under stress. \nHaving farewelled fullback Ben Barba to French Rugby Union, the Sharks have also been forced to prepare for round one without powerful winger Sosaia Feki (knee) and rising star Valentine Holmes (hamstring). \nSuch were his limited options in the backline ahead of last weekend’s World Club Challenge, Cronulla coach Shane Flanagan chose debutant Jesse Raimen and backrower Kurt Capewell in each wing position against Wigan. \nA hamstring injury stymied Lee’s 2016 season, which had begun with much promise following his selection in the Indigenous All Stars side. \nThe 196cm tall Lee, who has scored 34 tries in 70 first-grade games, will commence training with the Sharks, in preparation for the Broncos, on Friday.
