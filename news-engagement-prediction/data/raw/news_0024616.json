Richard Branson, who owns the island. \nHe fell on his butt. A lot. \nHere they are with Branson playfully choking Obama. \nHere a shot of Necker Island. Vacationing here must be very hard… \nMedia is waxing on his need for a good vacation after such hard work for eight years. \nDidn’t he spend half his time golfing or on vacation? \nBut it is such a relief to see him now, knowing that when he fails or falls over now, it isn’t affecting policy, now that he is no longer President.
