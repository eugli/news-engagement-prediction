It’s difficult to get change when you’re travelling,” he said. \nIkano Power Centre’s Halasuria Money Changer staff said wholesalers now only sold Rs2,000 rupee notes although they had smaller denominations as and when they bought some from the public. \nA SkyXChange moneychanger staff, who wanted to be identified as Mohd, said while moneychangers used to sell notes as low as Rs100 and Rs500 rupees, they could now only offer the Rs2,000 rupee notes. \nIn Johor Baru, The Star found that many moneychangers had yet to get the new rupee banknotes or were relying on people returning from India to change their notes. \nEastern Union F.X. Sdn Bhd partner Rahman Ibrahim said it had to turn down many customers wanting to buy the new rupee banknotes because they have no new stock. \n“We were informed by our colleagues in India that the new Rs500 and Rs2,000 rupees are already in circulation there.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:36:30.686+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
