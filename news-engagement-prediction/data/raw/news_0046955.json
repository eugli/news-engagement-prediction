For a local band, that’s pretty much unheard of ( “We should get an award just for still being around,” says frontman Nikhil Uzgare). Which makes it all the more surprising that their appearance as the Red Bull Opening Act for Guns N’ Roses on March 3 will be their first support slot for an international band visiting the UAE. \n“I think our progress was consistent, but in terms of achievements or recognition, it was a little slow,” says Uzgare, who founded the band in 2005. “Everyone we know keeps asking, ‘Why haven’t you guys played a big gig till now?’ and we haven’t had an answer for it. But I think, thanks to consistency, people are finally noticing us and we’ve finally got a big gig and we couldn’t have asked for a better one, to be honest.” \nHe’s not wrong. The current Guns N’ Roses tour marks the first time that classic lineup members Slash and bassist Duff McKagan have performed live with vocalist Axl Rose since GnR were the most popular band in the world in the early Nineties. It’s one of the biggest events in rock for a long time, and Uzgare is well aware of what a privilege it is to be asked to open for them. “I grew up in the glam rock era, so, for me, GnR will be special,” he says. “[GnR’s hugely successful debut LP] Appetite For Destruction was one of my first albums.” Guns N’ Roses © Navin Khianey \nOver the last few years, Point of View have raised their game to a new level, particularly live. The first step, Uzgare believes, was the addition of guitarist Royden Mascarenhas in 2010. The core original lineup of Point of View – Uzgare, drummer Kiran Tauro, and guitarist Murtaza Jafar, along with a few different bassists – had performed plenty of gigs and written plenty of songs, but Mascarenhas gave them all new motivation. “Until Royden joined, we were just a band that sounded good,” Uzgare says. “We already had Murtaza, who’s a great guitar player, but then Royden came in and it took us to another level. He’s a very accomplished musician who’s classically trained, but is open to all genres. He pretty much changed the sound of the band. When you have a guy like that – who can spot a bum note in the middle of all the noise – you know he’s looking for perfection. It quickly raises the benchmark.” \nThe year after Mascarenhas joined, Point of View started work on their debut album, Revolutionize The Revolutionary. It was released in 2012. “We all work, so we were recording at weekends,” Uzgare explains. “And we wanted to take our time because we wanted to make sure that whatever we put out was good.” In the meantime, Uzgare had initiated a friendship that would raise the band’s profile, inspire its members, and that gives their GnR opening slot a personal connection. In 2010, Guns N’ Roses (as they were then, i.e. Axl Rose and no other original members) performed in Abu Dhabi. Uzgare went along and, he says, Uzgare stresses, but he started to read up on Bumblefoot, watched some of his videos and finally sent him a quick note on Facebook. Minutes later, he got a response. The two chatted intermittently for a while, but it was a couple of months before the then-GnR guitarist asked Uzgare what he did. Uzgare mentioned he was in a band called Point of View and that they were just about to start mastering some of the album tracks, and Thal asked if he could hear some songs. \n“I really wasn’t keen, because I still wasn’t sure who I was talking to,” says Uzgare. \n“But I thought, ‘We’re in Dubai, I’m not going to be making a fortune from these songs.’ So I sent a few.” Bumblefoot (or the person Uzgare really hoped was Bumblefoot) was impressed, and when he found out they were at the mastering stage, he offered to reach out to contacts in New York on behalf of the band. And then he offered to fly over to Dubai for the album launch to perform with them. Which was when Uzgare realised he’d better get proof that he really had been talking to Ron Thal, and not “some kid with nothing better to do” . So they arranged a Skype chat. “I still have that chat recorded,” Uzgare says. “At that point, I hadn’t even told the band I’d been chatting to Bumble, because I thought they’d just make fun of me and say someone was taking me for a ride. Like, why would he take any interest in an unknown band from Dubai?” But he had. And he did fly in to perform at the album launch. In the years since, he’s toured with Point of View in India – turning down the chance to stay at five-star hotels in order to join the band in “some lodge”– and “shamelessly pimped us to everyone” , including the GnR crew. \n\nGuns N’ Roses © Navin Khianey \nThe last time GnR came to the UAE, in 2013, Point of View were invited backstage. “There were about 70 people in that GnR crew, and I’d say 50 of them knew us very well,” Uzgare says. “They had our album. \n“A lot of people ask us how we did it. Like, ‘We want to get somebody famous down for our gig. How much did you pay?’ And it’s really not like that,” he continues. “ Until this day, he’s never taken any money from us for anything, despite me pushing him to take it. It was just something nice that happened naturally. It’s not a business relationship. It’s a genuine connection. And it’s probably the best thing that’s happened to us.” \nBut Point of View have worked hard on their own to ensure they’re constantly improving as well. They’ve focused particularly on making their live shows more entertaining. \n“I’d worked on my stage act, but the rest of them still had a lot of inhibitions, and they’d hold back onstage,” Uzgare says. “But I think we just got more confident and more comfortable in our own skins. Suddenly, activity onstage increased. We just started getting better and better. And then people started taking suggestions from each other. Like, ‘In this number, I’m going to do something in the breakdown, and I need everybody to be involved. We can’t have three people doing it and one guy standing in the corner like he’s disconnected.’ So we were working on it like a proper product. But at the same time, we didn’t want to plan it to the point where it looks fake. Do it the way you feel it, but do it. That’s really worked for us. Now it seems natural. It’s not awkward or uncomfortable. And a lot of people have said the chemistry’s awesome. People connect to the enthusiasm you show.” \nPoint of View will have a reunion of their own at the GnR show too. Jafar recently relocated to New York, where he works for a bank. But he’ll be back to perform the last two songs of the set with the band (along with new guitarist Arsh Sharma). “We’ve been around for so long and he moves and we finally get the gig of a lifetime,” Uzgare says. “For us, it’s an emotional moment, and we said, ‘You must be there.’ So we’ll get him onstage to share the big moment.” \nApart from that, though, Point of View aren’t planning any real surprises for the biggest gig of their lives. \n“We know people are coming to see GnR, not us,” says Uzgare (showing a self-awareness that isn’t always apparent among local acts opening for international headliners). “We just want to put on a good show, that’s all. And hopefully they’ll walk away thinking, ‘Who were those guys? They were good.’” read more about", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:31:21.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
