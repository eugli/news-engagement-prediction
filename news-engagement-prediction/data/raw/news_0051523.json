(Alyssa Pointer / Chicago Tribune) Tony Briscoe ’s agenda, including immigration issues.\nWith a police escort, several hundred people marched from Trump Tower to Federal Plaza expressing displeasure with the Trump administration's court-paused travel ban, its policies on immigrants in the United States without legal permission and his promise to build a wall at the United States-Mexico border . \nMarchers held signs blasting Trump, including one reading “Will trade 1 Trump for 10,000 refugees.” Organizers also led the group in shouting in support of Chicago’s immigrant community, “What do we do when immigrants are under attack? Stand up, fight back.” \nThe protest, which caused some traffic delays, ended with a rally at Federal Plaza, where Angelica Magana, founder of the group Rise and Organize, blasted Trump for recent raids carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \n“He has already come after people like me,” Magana said. “I’m an undocumented Mexican woman. I’m a DACA recipient. … We were given a promise that we were going to be protected if we came out of the shadows. But that promise has been broken.” \nDemonstrators also denounced Trump’s administration for its position on climate change, gender equality and other issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T00:31:55.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
