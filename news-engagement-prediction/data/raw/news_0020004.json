The film, directed by Rajkumar Hirani has already gathered a lot of buzz around it. It’s been reported that Sanjay has given over 200 hours of recording as basic matter for the biopic. While the biopic will star Paresh Rawal as Sunil Dutt, Manisha Koirala as Nargis Dutt, Dia Mirza as Maanayata Dutt, Vicky Kaushal as Sanjay Dutt’s friend, Sonam Kapoor as his love interest and Anushka Sharma in the role of journalist, here are five things we want to see in the biopic. In order to make the film as authentic as it gets and to present an honest account of Sanjay Dutt’s life (we definitely don’t wanna see another Azhar), Rajkumar Hirani should highlight these points from Sanjay Dutt’s life.. \n# Sanjay Dutt’s stint with drugs \nSanjay Dutt has been pretty vocal about it and it has played an influential role in his early as he used to under the influence of drugs most of the times. Rishi Kapoor too revealed in his biography that Sanjay Dutt was dating Tina Munim at one point of time and came to beat up Rishi Kapoor, high on drugs when he thought he is seeing Tina. So this is a must as most of his actions those days were courtesy drugs he was on. \n# His relationship with Madhuri Dixit and other affairs \nWhile Rishi Kapoor revealed that Sanjay Dutt was dating Tina Munim, his most known affair was with Madhuri Dixit. It was also reported that at one point they were supposed to get married but then Sanjay’s name was involved in the 1993 bomb blast case and their relationship witnessed a sudden end. Since then, Sanjay always showed his dislike towards her, in one way or the other. \n# Sanjay Dutt’s involvement in the 1993 bomb blast case and subsequent arrest \nHis name was involved in the bomb blast and he was arrested for possessing illegal weapon. These things should be there in the movie as authentic as it gets. This was the same reason he was sentenced to jail. Also read: Sanjay Dutt wanted to essay Sunil Dutt’s role his biopic starring Ranbir Kapoor \n# His relations with the underworld \nTelephonic recordings of Sanjay Dutt talking to Dawood Ibrahim or other gangsters about certain Bollywood stars have gone viral. That should also be touched upon in the film. \n# His marriages, including that with Maanayata and relation with his daughter Trishala \nSanjay Dutt married thrice and in those three marriages he has three kids, Trishala, Iqra and Shahraan. How was he as a husband and most importantly his relation with his estranged daughter, Trishala would be interesting to see.
