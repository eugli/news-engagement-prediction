Smooth move, dumb a--.” \nThe gag continued throughout the evening as the two traded barbs — Damon even tried to trip Kimmel at one point.

Kimmel even tried to play Damon off the stage while he was presenting an award.

I’m just presenting, why are you playing me off?” \nKimmel even got in one final jab before best picture was announced, saying he was glad that Damon had once again not won an Academy Award. \nDamon and Kimmel’s ongoing feud, which goes back to 2005, was a focal point up during the ceremony, but they’d been ramping up the drama leading up to the Oscars.
