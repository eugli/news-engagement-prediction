Koi apne aap ko is desh ka karta-dharta, kuchch bhi maane, to bhi vo kisi ki deshbhakti kitni hai, ye naap nahin sakta. Ya naap kar is pe bol nahin sakta (No one has the right to measure anyone’s patriotism… I too don’t have the right. Even those who may feel they are running the show in cannot measure anyone’s patriotism.
