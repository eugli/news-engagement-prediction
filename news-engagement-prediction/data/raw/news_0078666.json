Only time will tell if Mats are more successful than local authorities in tackling under-performance and supporting high-performing schools.” \nIn a highly critical report published on Tuesday, MPs said there is a long way to go before ministers can demonstrate that public money given to academies is being used effectively. They called on the government to place tighter restrictions on the growth of trusts, some of which have suffered after expanding too quickly. \nThe committee said there is not yet sufficient evidence to support large-scale expansion of the policy as envisaged by ministers, and urged the government to allow local authorities with a strong track record in education to set up their own Mats. \nAmid growing alarm about school funding, the report also raises concerns about the capacity of the Department for Education (DfE), and the Education Funding Agency, to cope with the additional pressure any significant expansion of Mats would impose on their ability to oversee school finances. The number of Mats in England has increased from 391 in 2011 to 1,121 in 2016. \nKevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said the committee report would be uncomfortable reading for the education secretary, Justine Greening, and her team.

We encourage all trusts to work collaboratively and the best already do so but maintaining their independence is a crucial part of encouraging the innovation that has driven up standards in so many schools.” \nMalcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “The growing number of Mats is part of a developing system and there are challenges which need to be addressed. However, the early signs we are seeing suggest that there are significant benefits in schools collaborating either through Mats or federations of maintained schools.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:08:50.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
