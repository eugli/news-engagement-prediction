Besides barring refugees, Trump's order blocks citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entering the U.S. and includes those who are permanent U.S. residents, students or other travelers who secured the appropriate visas. Trump is expected to sign another executive order overhauling the high-tech visa program that helps Amazon, Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) and many Puget Sound-area technology companies bring in highly skilled workers from around the world when they can’t fill jobs locally . The overhaul would be the latest in a series of Trump orders to restrict the U.S. immigration system. The draft proposal targets H-1B visas – which allows employers to bring in foreign workers to fill specialized U.S. jobs when they can’t find local workers with appropriate skills – and other visa programs, including the L-1 transfer visas. Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) is considering placing Iran-born job candidates in offices outside of the U.S. after President Donald Trump blocked immigrants like them from entering the nation. Tableau (NYSE: DATA) has offices across the border in Vancouver, British Columbia, as do Microsoft Corp. , Expedia, Amazon, and other Puget Sound-area tech companies. The Tableau Foundation has launched a double-match campaign for employee contributions to organizations addressing refugee immigration issues. The foundation is also providing software and services to refugee and immigration organizations. Here is the memo Selipsky sent to employees Monday: I wanted to reach out regarding the recent executive order on immigration to the United States that has been on so many people’s minds. Our first priority has been to ensure the well-being of our employees and their families. Our review over the weekend did not find any employee who has yet been affected by or faces imminent problems due to the order. However, we stand ready to support employees and their families who may find themselves impacted by this or any change in immigration policy. While we will continue to focus on our employees, let’s also consider this issue in the context of the values of our company. We are a global company and we respect the ability of all people — regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, origin, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or age— to contribute to our progress, to our community, and to our mission. Every single corner of our company has flourished by embracing talented, creative individuals regardless of their origin. Working together has helped us build revolutionary products and made it possible for over 50,000 organizations in every part of the world see, understand, and do remarkable things with data. None of this would have been possible if we had limited our collective abilities by being exclusionary. We agree that we need safe borders to protect our way of life. But the answer is not to issue broad proclamations against religions or nationalities. We are strongest when we embrace and embody our national values of tolerance, collaboration, inclusion, and respect. If we want to live these values, then we need to base policy on intelligent and nuanced analysis — on data — rather than on fear. That is not a political statement, nor a partisan statement, nor a commentary on any person. It is a statement about being willing to stand up for what is right. One way we at Tableau are helping immediately is through the Tableau Foundation. We are launching a double-match campaign for contributions made by employees to organizations addressing refugee immigration issues (retroactive to contributions made since last Friday). In addition, the Tableau Foundation is providing additional software and services to organizations in support of their refugee- and immigration-related missions. On a personal note, had my grandparents not been allowed to flee Eastern Europe between the First and Second World Wars, I might well not be here today. In addition, I am an immigrant to the U.S., and am grateful for that privilege. Thank you to all for your passion on these issues as well as your tolerance for those who hold diverse and opposing views. Both are vital to our well-being.
