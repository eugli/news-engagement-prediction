Even more, the movie will hit a cineplex screen near you on May 25, 2018 , according to Lucasfilm. SEE ALSO: Young Han Solo director finds the perfect way to reveal filming has begun \nThe Disney subsidiary also confirmed a number of things you might've already suspected: \nChewbacca will be in the movie (played by Joonas Suotamo, rather than the aging Peter Mayhew). So will the Millennium Falcon, with or without a few special modifications. \nThe movie will focus on Han and Chewie's adventures prior to the 1977 original Star Wars film, including \"early encounters\" with Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover). Which makes it the second Star Wars prequel to enter the canon since Disney bought Lucasfilm (the first being 2016's Rogue One .) \nFrom left: Woody Harrelson, Christopher Miller, Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Alden Ehrenreich, Emilia Clarke, Joonas Suotamo, Phil Lord and Donald Glover. \nImage: lucasfilm \nAlso now confirmed is Phoebe Waller-Bridge , the British actor to Woody Harrelson's right, who's rumored to be playing a CGI character in the style of Alan Tudyk's K-2SO from Rogue One . \nThandie Newton , best known as a host robot on HBO's Westworld , is also now confirmed in the cast—though apparently there wasn't enough room in the cockpit for her. \n“We can’t think of anything funny to say,\" said Phil Lord and Chris Miller, mirth-filled creators of the Lego Movie and now directors of the Han Solo picture. \"We just feel really moved, and really lucky.\" \nLittle is known yet about the role Emilia Clarke (at center) will play, though the young scoundrel seems in need of a love interest. Woody Harrelson has said he will play a mentor from the seedy underworld of galactic smuggling. \nThe father-and-son team of Lawrence and Jon Kasdan wrote the script, meaning we can expect double the Empire Strikes Back -style sparkling dialogue. But for now, just take in the thousand words of joy that is the above photo, and hit the countdown clock: Only fifteen or so months until Solo finally gets his spotlight.
