LAWRENCE SMITH \nThe fifth defendant, Wayne Blackett. \nThe complainant was allegedly subjected to two attacks where she was stripped, tied up, had her hair hacked off, was repeatedly tasered, sexually violated, assaulted with various weapons, and had her finger stomped on until it broke. \nThe Crown then says three of the group beat the woman with a hammer until she nearly died. \nThe accused are Michelle Blom, Nicola Jones, Cameron Hakeke, Wayne Blackett and Julie-Ann Torrance. \nTheir alleged victim was a 19-year-old sex worker. \nThe teenager was found by two walkers on a remote dirt road in Auckland's Dome Valley, between Warkworth and Wellsford, in May last year. \nThe complainant, who can't be named, was unconscious, clothed in an old pair of overalls and her hair had been \"crudely\" cut off, leading the pair who discovered her to think she was a man, Crown prosecutor Henry Steele said in an opening address on Monday. \n\"It was immediately clear to them when they found her first thing on Monday morning that she had suffered terribly.\" \nSteele said the genesis for the alleged attack on the teen was Jones' grudge with the complainant, whom she suspected of sleeping with her ex-boyfriend. \n\"It's not relevant whether they have or not, Nicola Jones is very upset,\" Steele said. \nText messages would be produced that showed Jones texted the complainant's mother, telling her she was going to kill her daughter. \n\"I'm going to kill her... if I see her, I'm going to kill her,\" Jones allegedly said. \n\"The texts between (the complainant and Jones' ex) are unreal, so your daughter is history.\" \n\"What is abundantly clear from those text messages is that she's angry. She's seething,\" Steele said. \nMonths later, in April 2016, Jones and two friends of hers, Hakeke and Torrance, planned \"revenge\". \nHakeke is alleged to have lured the complainant to a Green Bay, West Auckland, home where Steele said Torrance and Jones \"ambushed\" the woman. \nThey are alleged to have tasered her repeatedly, cut off her hair, and forced her to sign over her car. \nThe women then allegedly drove the complainant to the Bombays, where she was dropped on the side of the road and warned not to return to Auckland, Steele said. \nHowever, two weeks later the complainant was back working on Hereford St, in Auckland city, when she again encountered Jones and Torrance. \nThis time the two defendants were with friends Michelle Blom and another woman Jaclyn Keates, the court was told. \nThe complainant was allegedly dragged into the car and taken to a Great North Rd address where she was stripped, tied up, and assaulted with a cricket wicket and had her hair cut again. \nThe complainant was kept at the address for the better part of a day before Blackett arrived at the address and it was said that he, Torrance, and Jones drove the complainant to the Dome Valley. \nOn the side of the road the trio allegedly tried to strangle the woman, still tied up, before trying to break her neck. \nWhen that failed Steele alleged the three took a hammer from the tray of Blackett's ute. \nA pathologist would give evidence that the complainant had seven \"hammer shaped holes\" in her skull. \n\"Her skull is smashed and you will see the images from a CT scan... this was a determined and prolonged attack intended, clearly, to kill, make no mistake of that,\" Steele said. \n\"That she didn't die...and the charge is only one of attempted murder is nothing short of a miracle, because that's how they left her.\" \nThe complainant was found the following day. \nThe trial began with a warning from Justice Christian Whata, who told the 12 jurors they would hear some \"disturbing\" things, but that they had to put their emotions to one side. \nBefore the trial began Blackett pleaded guilty to kidnapping and attempted murder. \nThe trial is expected to last no longer than four weeks. \nTHE CHARGES \nThe defendants have denied the following: \nNicola Jones: Threatening to kill, sexual violation, attempted murder, injuring with intent, assault with a taser \nJulie-Ann Torrance: Injuring with intent, assault with a taser, assault with scissors 2x, assault with a cricket wicket, sexual violation, attempted murder \nCameron Hakeke: kidnapping, stealing a car, assault with a taser, assault with scissors \nMichelle Blom: Injuring with intent, kidnapping, assault with a cricket wicket, assault with scissors, sexual violation \nWayne Blackett: assault with a cricket wicket, assault with scissors, sexual violation. - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:55:21.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
