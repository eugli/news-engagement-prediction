By TIMOTHY PRATT Continue reading the main story Photo Members of the supporters’ clubs Terminus Legion and the Faction playing a pickup game in Atlanta this month. Both clubs are made up of fans of the city’s new pro soccer team, Atlanta United F.C. Credit Kevin D. Liles for The New York Times ATLANTA — Terminus Legion, despite the finality of its name, came first. Long before Atlanta’s new Major League Soccer team had a date for its inaugural game, before it had an owner or a stadium or a youth academy or even a single player, the team had a supporters’ club. And then another. And another. Footie Mob offered fans the promise of a backbeat of Atlanta music, and sweet, smoky barbecue. The Faction was a blend of natives and transplants with a charity bent. Resurgence is for “grass-roots love of the game,” according to its website, though perhaps just for the adult set: Two of three chants listed on the site include a four-letter expletive. All the groups, though, have a common thread: They have wrapped their arms around the city’s new pro soccer team, Atlanta United F.C., which will play its first M.L.S. game on Sunday, at Georgia Tech’s Bobby Dodd Stadium, against the Red Bulls. (The team’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium is scheduled to open July 30.) Supporters’ groups, loosely organized or closely affiliated with teams, are a longstanding part of soccer, and they have long been the leading edge of fan culture in M.L.S. Philadelphia’s main fan group, Sons of Ben, predates the team it supports, traveling to matches involving other teams just to sit in the stands and chant about wanting one of its own. Many of the cities bidding to be part of the league’s next round of expansion already have fan clubs in place . Photo Players at the pickup game. The city’s fan groups have each forged an identity and a following. Credit Kevin D. Liles for The New York Times Atlanta, though, has shown an unusual diversity of fan groups, as well as a surprising appetite for tickets. The organization has already set an M.L.S. expansion team record, with 30,000 season tickets sold. When Atlanta United turned up for its first official game during the preseason, an exhibition two hours north in Chattanooga, Tenn., it arrived with 8,000 fans in tow. When the team plays its first league game, it will do so in front of more than 40,000 fans — a near-capacity crowd. Continue reading the main story The city’s fan groups have each forged an identity and a following, and they may answer an important question: What does it mean to support a soccer team in the South — and specifically in Atlanta, the so-called capital of the South? \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story J. R. Francis has been wrestling with the question since 2013. At the time, another prospective fan, Matt Stigall, was helping to lead a petition drive to bring an M.L.S. team to Atlanta. Francis and hundreds of others quickly signed on. The petitioners got the attention of Arthur Blank, the Home Depot co-founder and Atlanta Falcons owner, by sending his staff news of how boxes of papers with signatures were mounting. By the end of 2013, they had gathered about 4,000 names. One day, Francis said, they got a cryptic email from Blank’s organization. “It’s time to turn your petition drive into a supporters’ group,” the email said. Terminus Legion was born. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The name, Francis noted, has roots in Atlanta’s history. Terminus was the city’s first name , in the early 19th century, when Atlanta was not so much a bustling Southern capital but merely the end of a rail route that started in Chattanooga.

Credit John Bazemore/Associated Press Four years after its founding, Terminus Legion continues to grow. At a midtown bar several weeks ago, an event called Terminalia drew dozens of fans with black, gold and red scarves, buzzing in anticipation of Atlanta United’s debut. Jorge E. Alonso, the group’s director of brand development, set up two laptops on a table to sign up new members amid the clamor. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Michael Page stood nearby. As he took his wallet from the back pocket of his jeans to pay for a beer, a blue Chelsea F.C. supporter’s card fell to the floor. Page, 49, lived in London for a year three decades ago, an adventurous teenager tending bar at a pub only blocks from Chelsea’s stadium, Stamford Bridge. A geographer at Emory University, Page is a rarity in Atlanta: someone with family roots here that date back several generations. But he has followed Chelsea and England’s Premier League until now, finding it difficult to warm to M.L.S. because “I didn’t have a team where I’m from.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story A few weeks after Terminalia, Mark Knipfer was nursing his 39-year-old ankles after he and other members of the Faction , another supporters’ group, beat members of Terminus Legion, 2-1, in the last 60 seconds of a Sunday game. The Faction, Knipfer said, is like its founders: half from somewhere else and half native to Georgia, or at least generally Southern. It is more of a family-oriented set, with a website that pledges an embrace of values like “using sport to help develop youth character.” The Faction raises money to support the Fugees Family, an Atlanta-area program that supports refugee children from 23 countries and that includes a school and soccer team. So far, the money comes from membership fees: $10 for adults, $5 for children. About 100 people have joined, Knipfer said. “We want to get to the point we’re recognized as a formidable force, maybe 1,000,” he said.
