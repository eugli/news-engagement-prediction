The 21-year-old United Arab Emirates (UAE) batsman received a \"surprise\" call from an IPL franchisee about two months back asking him to register for the IPL auction .\nIn fact, Suri is one among the six associate players (out of 351) to be shortlisted for the auction to be held in Bengaluru on February 20 and is the first ever player from UAE to make it to the auction pool.\nBorn in Delhi (Punjabi Bagh), Suri led his school (Modern School) team till he was 11 years old. After that, UAE was his place.\nSuri, a BBA graduate, came through the ranks in UAE and represented his country in the 2014 U-19 World Cup. Ever since the U-19 WC, Suri always \"dreamt\" of being part of an IPL team.\n\"It's always a dream to be a part of IPL. Every cricketer knows the value of it. It's not easy to make a career out of cricket being in an associate nation. This is the first time I have been part of an IPL auction and I'm the first player from UAE to make the list. I thank our Emirates Board for all their support and guidance,\" Suri told TOI.\nAs luck would have it, the initial half of the 2014 IPL was played in the UAE. An attacking right-handed batsman, Suri was up against the Rajasthan Royals attack that had the likes of Tim Southee and Shane Watson in a practice game. Later he also featured in a couple of games against Mumbai Indians.\n\"When the IPL teams were in Dubai (2014), we played some practice matches against RR and Mumbai Indians and I did well. I scored about 70-odd runs in some 40 balls against Rajasthan. Against Mumbai, I scored a couple of quick 40s. I also met Rahul Dravid and spoke a few words. Even Sachin was there watching, Ricky Ponting and Anil Kumble too were there,\" he added.\nHowever, he didn't get noticed immediately. \"I didn't get any calls for the last three years and that's why I didn't register,\" he added.\nAfter three years, he got \"the\" call. \"An IPL team contacted me about two months back and they wanted me to register for the auction. It was actually a surprise. I was in good form over the past few months. I played well against England Lions, had a strong domestic season and I even did well in a tournament in Sri Lanka which had a few of their Test players.\n\"But I felt good after being picked in the final list. I didn't come down for any IPL trial. But I guess some Indian coaches or scouts may have seen me because some of them were here for some scouting or the other,\" he added.\nSuri said he owes a lot to UAE coaches Owais Shah (former England batsman) and Aaqib Javed (former Pakistan pacer) with whom he worked a lot.\n\"Owais gave me a lot of tips. He told me that this is the time to breakthrough. I had worked day and night with him for the past three months. He was very happy for me when I told him that I have been shortlisted. He knows that it's the best league.\n\"With Aaqib it was more about working on the mental side of my game. He once told me.. 'If you can do it one-day, you can do it again and again'. It's about consistency. He told us to believe in ourselves and say UAE players are not lesser than anyone. We have the ICC academy here and good coaches training here. Our players are improving,\" said Suri, who added that his hero is none other than Indian skipper Virat Kohli.\nSuri said it was great to see IPL teams notice talents from associate nations. \"UAE cricket will get a boost if I get picked. If one gets through, then the gate opens for other. The various leagues that are being played across the globe give chances to associate cricketers.\n\"I would love to see at least one or two associate cricketers play in every IPL season. Even getting shortlisted, has created a huge buzz in UAE. It's great that IPL teams have taken note of a talent from UAE. If I get to play in IPL, then I can learn a lot. I believe when you play with better cricketers, you always get better,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T20:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:09:05.449+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
