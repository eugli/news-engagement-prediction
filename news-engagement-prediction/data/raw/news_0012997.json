This could further increase global interest rates if risk premia were to rise considerably, or lower interest rates if global demand falls.\" \nThere are two other Reserve Bank events on this week that are more important than the rates meeting. \nOn Thursday night, RBA governor Philip Lowe will deliver his first speech for 2017 at an economics dinner in Sydney. \nOn Friday morning, the RBA will release its latest quarterly Statement on Monetary Policy, which should give a clearer indication of the outlook for interest rate movements this year. \nMore to come.
