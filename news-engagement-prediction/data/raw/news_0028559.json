Unprecedented fire danger for NSW as heatwaves continue across south-east Read more \nAt 5am on Sunday, the NSW rural fire service advised there were 76 bush or grass fires burning across the state and 21 of those were not contained. The Bureau of Meteorology said a trough was moving northeast from the central region, producing very hot, dry and gusty northwesterly winds. \n“This will produce widespread severe to catastrophic fire conditions in central and northern districts,” the bureau said. \nExtreme fire danger ratings were in place for five areas in the state including the north coast, northern slopes, upper central west plains and lower central west plains regions. \n“To put it simply, they’re simply off the old conventional scale,” RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said on Saturday. \nFitzsimmons said the severity of the conditions on Sunday could not be understated. He said conditions were worse than those on Black Saturday in 2009, which claimed 173 lives and has been described as one of Australia’s worst peacetime disasters. \nPolice pleaded with residents to heed warnings from authorities after three teenage bushwalkers were rescued from the Marramarra National Park on the Hawkesbury River, near Sydney . \nThe two women and one man set off about 2.30pm Saturday, carrying heavy backpacks, and quickly ran out of water. They called emergency services and were rescued after 6pm, suffering mild heat exposure and dehydration. \nThe acting assistant commissioner Kyle Stewart said the actions of the trio jeopardised the safety of both themselves and first responders. \n“While the incident had a good outcome, it could have had a very different ending,” he said. “The simple message is stay out of the national parks and state forests and make sure you avoid any outdoor activities that will put you at risk.” \nThe heatwave across south-east Australia continued to break records on Saturday. Parts of Western Sydney reached 47C on Saturday afternoon , including Penrith, which experienced its hottest day on record. \nThe outback town of White Cliffs, in NSW’s north-west, broke the record for the hottest minimum overnight temperature. Residents endured a stifling night with a low of only 34.2 degrees. \nSouth Australia’s northern regions and Queensland’s south were also caught in the heatwave. \nCanberra recorded its second consecutive 40-degree day for only the third time in its history, while Sydney’s Observatory Hill broke the record for the longest-running spell of days above 35C, which now sits at 10. \nWhile regional areas in NSW were set to swelter again on Sunday, a cooler change was expected to blow into Sydney. Temperatures in the city were not forecast to rise above 30C with a possible shower. \nFirefighters kept a close eye on a bushfire east of Dunedoo overnight and said they would take advantage of the milder morning conditions to undertake back burning operations.
