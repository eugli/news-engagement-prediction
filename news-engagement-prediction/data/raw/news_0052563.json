When his ex-lover asked for forgiveness, he gave her a 'D' grade. IndiaToday.in | Written by Sanjana Agnihotri A + A - Photo: Twitter/@NickLutz12 \nGetting a text, an email or a letter from an ex can either evoke too many emotions or trigger sheer indifference. Many people either become nostalgic or emotional and respond, but some choose to be brutally silent about it. \nBut Twitter user, Nick Lutz, responded and his response has made him a star on the internet. When Nick received a four-page letter from his ex-girlfriend, he decided to give back a cold response. And eventually scored another date by posting it on Twitter. \nWhile his girlfriend pleaded for forgiveness, he went on to grade the letter and pointed out the errors. Nick meticulously went through the letter and gave a critique of various lines and paragraphs, treating it an essay. \nHe corrected the spellings, commented on the introduction and conclusion and asked her to back her \"strong hypothesis\" with proof. When your ex writes you an apology letter so you grade it to send it back pic.twitter.com/MczdjcCiil â€” Nick Lutz (@NickLutz12) February 17, 2017 \n\"Long intro, short conclusion. Strong hypothesis but nothing to back it up. Details are important. If you want to be believed, back it up with proof. You claimed that cheating never occurred, but place blame on yourself - what for? Need to stop contradicting your own story and pick a side. While this gesture is appreciated, I would prefer details over statements. Revision for half credit will be accepted, Good luck\", this is what Nick wrote at the end of the letter. \nHe graded the letter D and gave her 61 out of 100. Like a boss, he posted a photo of the letter on Twitter which went viral with 1,06,825 retweets and 312,645 likes. \nAnother Twitter user, impressed by his savage cold response, expressed her admiration to him and in no time Nick got himself a date. \nThis could culminate in a \"We Met On Twitter\" tale.
