Amal Al Jasmi, Director of Academic and Career Counseling at Ministry of Education, said there's much emphasis on training students on the \"21st century skills.\" \"At the ministry, we build the students' characters, giving them the skills they will need to help develop the country's future,\" said Al Jasmi, noting that the ministry's vision is to provide innovative education for a knowledge, pioneering, and global society.
