In it, a German shepherd appears to be reluctant as it’s being pushed in to a pool full of fast flowing water. The video shows a dog appearing to be in distress. \nREAD MORE: Animal cruelty investigation launched into Manitoba filmed movie ‘A Dog’s Purpose’ \nAccording to the American Humane Society, an independent, third-party investigation conducted by a respected animal cruelty expert showed that an edited video completely mischaracterized the events portrayed in the video on set. \n“The decisions by the individual or individuals who captured and deliberately edited the footage, and then waited longer than 15 months to release the manipulated video only days before the movie’s premier, raise serious questions about their motives and ethics,” the American Humane Society said in a release. \nThe statement from the animal welfare organization said the report brought a few other facts to light. \nIt said, the video was deliberately edited for the purpose of misleading the public and stoking outrage. \n“In fact, the two scenes shown in the edited video were filmed at different times,” the statement read. \nThe report did, however, find that the dog was momentarily stressed. Adding that American Humane believed that the handling of the dog in the first scene in the video should have been gentler and signs of stress recognized earlier. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
