You'd never know.\" \nMr King warned landholders that New Acland stage three may never proceed. \n\"It would be unwise, in our opinion, to enter into one of these agreements — we're advising great caution,\" he said. \n\"If New Acland coal can get these agreements all signed up then that's evidence that people are happy, and they may not be happy.\" \nHe said the company had engaged experienced consultants to work with farmers who had no legal experience. \n\"It's a first time runner against an experienced field, and that's an imbalance,\" he said. \nNew Hope Coal has declined to comment while the matter is before the court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T03:58:28.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
