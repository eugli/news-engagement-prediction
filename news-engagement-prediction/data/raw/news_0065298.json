By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Updated: February 23, 2017 4:49 pm Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut cannot see eye to eye, according to reports. \nThe Jaanbaaz Julia of Bollywood Kangana Ranaut has taken the Hindi film industry by storm after Queen. The actor broke all the norms of the industry and became a hit-churning machine for the filmmakers. \nToday, no one can believe that the actress once faced rejection for her accent and her small town background. The actor took every rejection as a challenge and defeated failure with her hard work. The self-made woman made the opinionated Bollywood biggies Aditya Chopra and Karan Johar take back their words about her career. \nAlso read | How Kangana Ranaut destroyed Karan Johar, and all he stands for, on Koffee With Karan \nIn an industry where many still fear opening up about their personal life and closely watch what they say in front of the media, Kangana answers every question like a boss. “Mera sense of humor bahot acha hai… aapko dheere dheere pata chalega,” Kangana said in her hit film Queen and with her every interview she really is coming out as a revelation. \nMore from the world of Entertainment: \n\nRecently, in an interview with BollywoodLife.com, Kangana was quizzed about Shahid Kapoor ’s remark on her where he called her a woman with a vivid imagination. Without the slightest sign of hesitation, the actor said, “That he has borrowed from Hrithik. It is completely borrowed and Hrithik should have a copyright of this statement. I feel everyone should have their own statements and not borrow statements.” \nThey might be seen sharing a steamy chemistry on-screen, but off-screen Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut cannot see eye to eye, according to reports. \nAlso read | Rangoon actor Kangana Ranaut says being goody two-shoes is really overrated \nHere are some other comments Kangana Ranaut made about Shahid Kapoor: \nKangana on sharing a cottage with Shahid Kapoor: “We were shooting in a remote location where a little makeshift cottage was erected. Shahid and I were sharing the cottages with our respective teams. Every morning, I would wake up to this mad hip-hop music. And he would exercise listening to crazy trance and techno songs blasting from the speakers. I was fed up and wanted to shift out. Sharing the cottage with Shahid was a nightmare.” \nKangana on her experience of working with Shahid Kapoor: “Shahid’s moustache was horrible and it (kissing) would be disgusting. Then he would keep telling me that he has a runny nose which helps it to stick.” \nKangana Ranaut on what she hates about Shahid Kapoor: “On his bad days, Shahid looks at you like you are a suicide bomber.” \nHere are Shahid Kapoor’s comments on Kangana Ranaut: \n“I would not like to play a table tennis match on this whole episode by answering to each of her comments. I just wish to put an end to this match. Kangana should move ahead with all her co-stars in an amicable manner and work with a team spirit.” \n“With Kangana, I’ve had a strictly professional relationship.” Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut in Rangoon’s Ye Ishq Hai. \nAlso read | Kangana Ranaut on Hrithik Roshan episode: I was told if I open my mouth, I will be finished \nWell, it is not the first time that Kangana has got into a feud with her co-stars.
