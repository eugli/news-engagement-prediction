Your skin has different needs from that of your mother or your best friend. Additionally, your skin care regimen can change with the seasons and as you age. Although your needs may vary, there are still a few skin care products that everyone needs all year round. While you may opt to add in a serum , night cream , or other items, these four products are the foundation of a great home skin care routine. A Skin Cleanser \nProperly and thoroughly cleansing your face is the foundation of any home skin care plan. In the morning this step sets the stage for the properly absorption of products and removes any cellular debris that accumulated during the night. In the evening this step is essential for removing make-up, skin care products, pollution, and dirt that have accumulated on your face during the day. Proper nightly cleansing is truly a must that cannot never be skipped. Sleeping with make-up on and not washing your face properly causing many skin problems including premature skin aging, blackheads, acne or dry skin. So do yourself a favor and make sure you take a few minutes to thoroughly wash your face both morning and night. An Exfoliant \nThe idea of exfoliation is actually quite simple but somehow it trips people up. Exfoliation is the removal of dead skin cells that sit on the very top layer of your skin. Regular exfoliation also gets rid of excess oil, and helps your pores stay clear from blackheads. When you exfoliate your skin regularly your skin will be smoother, softer, and the skin care products you apply afterwards will absorb better . If you suffer from acne, or even just an occasional breakout, exfoliation is a must so that your pores do not get clogged. \nHow often you should exfoliate and with what products depends on many factors including how much time you have to devote to your skin care routine, if your skin is acne prone or very oily, and what the weather is like where you live. \nA Moisturizer \nEveryone needs a moisturizer , even people with oily skin. Taking stock of what is going on with your skin will help you decide which moisturizer is right for you. Someone with combination or oily skin will want a lighter, gel-like moisturizer, while someone with dry skin will need a creamier, richer moisturizer. The season will also help determine which moisturizing product you need. For instance in the winter you might want to use a facial oil instead of a cream moisturizer, for additional hydration. Whereas a person with oily skin may only need a facial mist for the summer months. A Sunscreen \nEveryone needs sunscreen. That bears repeating: everyone, yes everyone, needs sunscreen all year round. Why? To protect your skin from skin cancer and from premature skin aging. \nSkin cancer is one of the most preventable types of cancer and, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation the most common form of cancer in the United States: 1 in 5 Americans will develop skin cancer over their lifetime. Simply applying sunscreen daily can do much to reduce your risk. \nJust like choosing your moisturizer, your skin type, lifestyle, and environmental factors like the climate you live in will determine which sunscreen is right for you.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:33:43.192+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
