It has been held annually since 2004 except for a hiatus last year. DPM Teo Chee Hean and Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli co-chair their countries' first JCBC meeting after a one-year hiatus. (Photo: Jeremy Koh) \nAhead of the meeting, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson had said that China sees Singapore as an important member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and that it wants to further strengthen trust and cooperation with Singapore. \nThis was a stance echoed by Vice Premier Zhang on Monday when he said that China and Singapore ties have grown from strength to strength. \nBesides the JCBC, Mr Teo and Mr Zhang will also co-chair meetings on the three flagship government-to-government (G2G) projects between China and Singapore - the Suzhou Industrial Park, Tianjin Eco-city and Chongqing Connectivity Initiative. \nThe meeting of the steering council for the Chongqing Connectivity Initiative that aims to turn Chongqing into a logistics and services hub was expected to be the highlight of the day. \nIt is the first such meeting since the project was launched in November 2015. - CNA/hs ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:26:24.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
