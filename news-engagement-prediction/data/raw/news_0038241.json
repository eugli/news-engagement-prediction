Close VIDEO Stannies apology \nBut his \"respected position\" masked a manipulative predator who sexually abused vulnerable and homesick boys who sought his help over two decades at St Stanislaus College in Bathurst. \nNow the 74-year-old former clergyman faces the prospect of dying in jail after he was sentenced in the NSW District Court on Thursday for the assaults on boys aged under 16 in the 1970s and 1980s. \nThe most serious charge was buggery. Pedophile former priest Brian Spillane. Source: 7 News \nThe court heard Spillane preyed on boys - some as young as 12 - who were feeling homesick and invited them up to his room under the guise of providing comfort. \nInstead they were subjected to various indecent assaults. \nA Year 10 student who went to Spillane's room seeking counselling was given tablets and a cough mixture which effectively drugged him, before he was assaulted on the priest's bed. \nHe was abused again some time later. \nA 13-year-old boy in 1985 was placed on Spillane's lap and subjected to an exorcism after being told he \"had the devil in him\" before being assaulted. \n\"He was devastated by the experience,\" Judge Robyn Tupman said on Thursday. \n\"He threw his clothes away and had a shower.\" \nAnother victim who was attending day school was sexually assaulted a number of times in 1978. \nThe 14-year-old, who had initially sought comfort from Spillane because his mother was sick, was told no one would believe his story after the assaults, which included buggery. \nThe abuse started with kisses but eventually exacerbated to rape. \nSpillane tried to initiate anal intercourse on the teen again after the student came to his room for disciplinary reasons. The boy told him to stop because it hurt. \nSpillane abused him in another way and as the student was leaving the room said: \"I don't know what we're going to do with you if you keep getting into trouble.\" \nSpillane also conducted group prayer sessions, where he would chant and \"speak in tongues\". During one session he touched a student's penis. \nJudge Tupman said Spillane had taken advantage of vulnerable boarders and obtained their silence in a \"particularly manipulative\" way. \nThe victims were impressionable teens away from their homes, without any sounding board to check Spillane's behaviour. \n\"He was charismatic and genuinely well regarded by the school and others,\" Judge Tupman said of Spillane. \n\"But he was using his respected position to abuse these children.\" \nOutside court one of the victims said his life had been destroyed by the abuse. \n\"For me, this is a life sentence,\" Damien Sheridan told reporters. \n\"What he's done to me, I'm still dealing with it all.\" \nSpillane, who has not expressed remorse for his actions, sat with this back to some of the victims in court. \nHis sentence will run concurrently with time he's already serving for previous convictions, extending his parole date to 2026. \nJudge Tupman said given Spillane's age there was a prospect the former priest would die a prisoner.
