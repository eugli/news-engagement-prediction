The protest caused delays for passengers getting into terminals.\nA Heathrow spokesman said: \"Heathrow airport can confirm that a protest activity is on-going in the in-bound tunnel to Terminals 2 and 3.\n\"Heathrow supports the right to peaceful protest within the law, but the safety and security of our passengers, aircraft and colleagues together with the smooth running of the operation is paramount.\n\"Contraflow traffic measures are in place and we are working closely with the authorities to resolve the issue, but advise passengers to allow more time to drive into Terminals 2 and 3.\"\nOne of those involved in the protest described a consultation process for the proposal for airport expansion as \"illegitimate and undemocratic\".\nHeathrow airport, where there has been a small climate change protest Credit: Hannah McKay/PA S imon Bramwell said: \"This blockade is our contribution to the consultation: a third runway is a disastrous option that will lead to climate chaos.\n\"I look upon my niece and nephew, upon the children who will inherit the future we are creating right now and my conscience tells me to act.\n\"I am breaking conditions imposed on me by the courts, following road blockades in November but the Government is not listening to the science or to our concerns. They have left us with no alternative but to keep taking action.\n\"We will not stop until plans to build another runway are fully and finally shut down\".\nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said officers were alerted to the disturbance at 8.25am.\nThe spokesman said: \"Officers attended the inbound tunnel and found three cars blocking the tunnel, with three protestors locked to one of them.\n\"The drivers of two of the vehicles have been arrested for obstructing a highway.\n\"Heathrow officers are working with Heathrow Airport staff to remove the people locked to the third car.\n\"A contra-flow is in place in the outbound tunnel to facilitate the movement of traffic around the blocked tunnel (which is now empty), but motorists are advised possible delays to their journey as this incident is dealt with.\"\nHeathrowâ€™s third runway - 16 years of dithering", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T11:54:16.676+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
