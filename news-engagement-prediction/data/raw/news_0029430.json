J-lilac!

You love Drake? \nShe went on to say the two worked together on a song. \nSo was it all “Fake Love”? Did this Instagram moment mean nothing to the two of them? Instagram \nSeacrest asked if there were “creative sparks” and JLo replied, \nYes, absolutely we hung out, we have a great time. He’s amazing. I have so much love for that boy. \nSo she’s still obviously into Drake — she’s dropped the “L” bomb twice. \nBut if her Instagram is to be believed, then it’s all about timing. She posted a photo that read, \nTiming is everything. If it’s meant to happen, it will, and for the right reasons. \nWhich, coincidentally, is exactly the same thing my mom tells me every time I get my HEART BROKEN. \nAccording to a source, \n[JLo and Drake] have taken some time apart, not because they don’t want to be with each other, just because their schedules started getting insane. \nLopez just continued her Vegas residency and Drake started his Boy Meets World Tour in Europe in January — that is a long time apart for a budding new relationship. \nThe source said: \nJLo and Drake are still talking, so people should know they are not in any means angry or that some incident happened. It mainly had to do with timing… They have just cooled things off a bit and it’s not as fast as it was in the beginning… They are in each other’s lives, just doing their own thing now. \nIf these two crazy kids can’t make it work, what hope do the rest of us have? Would you catch me if I fell?
