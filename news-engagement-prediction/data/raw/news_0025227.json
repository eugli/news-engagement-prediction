A combination of factors that all come with our typical pineapple express storm systems,\" said CBC meteorologist Johanna Wagstaffe.\nThe exact path and development of the system isn't clear yet, which is why Environment Canada issued their statement for all of the Lower Mainland, Sea-to-Sky Corridor, Sunshine Coast, and lower two-thirds of Vancouver Island, but with no warning for a specific region.\nWeather closes every highway linking Lower Mainland to rest of B.C. Snowstorm Part Three? New weather statement issued for B.C.'s South Coast Vancouver in its longest cold snap in over 30 years However, they are anticipating over 100 millimetres of rain for the hardest hit areas, and Wagsaffe said that flood warnings could be issued in places where high river steams can be an issue — particularly in the Fraser Valley, which has seen tremendous amounts of precipitation in the last week.    \n\"Even if we hadn't just come out of a big snowfall event, this is a big system on its own,\" she said. \n\"As the forecast comes into sharper focus, we'll have a better idea of where the bull's-eyes are, but definitely plan for the possibility of flooding across the South Coast, just because of how much rain we're getting. \n\nWhile rain is nothing new for British Columbians, this winter has seen an unusually high number of significant weather events on the west coast.\n\"It has been unusual,\" said Wagstaffe. \n\"The jet stream continues to direct all these Pacific storms right into B.C. That could be a combination of La Niña , as well as other large-scale atmospheric events.\n\"This is definitely out of the norm, even for us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:08:33.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
