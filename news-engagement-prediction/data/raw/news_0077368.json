From Getty Images. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that has tallied Oscar votes for decades, is in full damage-control mode. At Sunday night’s ceremony, La La Land was incorrectly named the night’s best-picture winner after presenters Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty were given the wrong envelope to open. The correct winner was actually Moonlight. The accounting firm was first out of the gate with an official explanation on Oscar night, releasing a statement three hours after the debacle in which it apologized “to Moonlight, La La Land, Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, and the Oscar viewers for the error.” So, what actually happened? It was the result of simple “human error,” according to Tim Ryan, U.S. chairman and senior partner of PwC, who detailed the incident in an interview with USA Today Monday. And that human error might have been caused by a distracted PwC employee who was tweeting a photo of Emma Stone right before he was set to hand Beatty and Dunaway the card containing best picture, per the investigative minds at The Wall Street Journal . (It appears the tweet has since been deleted.) “At the end of the day, we made a human error,” Ryan said. “We made a mistake. What happened was, our partner on the left side of the stage, Brian Cullinan, he handed the wrong envelope to Warren Beatty. And then the second we realized that, we notified the appropriate parties and corrected the mistake.” That correction took a remarkably long time to arrive. The cast and crew of La La Land had all assembled onstage—and two producers had managed to deliver acceptance speeches—by the time an Oscars producer and host Jimmy Kimmel joined them to announce Moonlight ’s surprise win. “We apologize to the cast of La La Land for having to have made those speeches in the time that it took to (correct it),” Ryan said to USA Today, reiterating the firm’s previous statement and repentant stance. “Immediately when it was announced, again, because of our mistake, both our partners who knew who the winner was—and they’re the only two who know—they realized the mistake had been made and they began to notify the appropriate people.” Brian Cullinan, chairman of PwC’s board, and Martha Ruiz, a tax partner at PwC, were the employees who held the briefcases with the envelopes. They were stationed on opposite sides of the stage, ready to hand the envelopes to presenters throughout the night. As an added security measure, both accountants also memorize the winners list every single year; in order to prevent leaks, it is not written down on paper or on an online document. The duo have been in charge of this task for years, and recently discussed the unique responsibility in an introductory video from PwC that plays slightly differently in the face of Sunday’s blunder. The clip stresses PwC’s reliability—a quality in question in the wake of its mistake. After Cullinan handed Dunaway and Beatty the wrong envelope, leading to La La Land ’s mistaken coronation, he and Ruiz immediately alerted show producers that a severe error had been made, according to The New York Times . What followed was utter chaos . Now, chairman Ryan is focusing his energy on apologizing to the Academy and to the teams who worked on Moonlight and La La Land. “I have spoken with the Academy and expressed our apologies and accountability, and I am in the process of reaching out to the other affected parties,” he said. “That has not happened yet but, I am in the process of doing that.” The full impact of the snafu on PwC's reputation has likely yet to be seen. “Not since Janet Jackson and her wardrobe malfunction on the Super Bowl have we seen something quite as glaring as this snafu,” a crisis expert told the Times Monday. And as a result, “the name of the firm has unfortunately been a little sullied.” Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:36:50.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
