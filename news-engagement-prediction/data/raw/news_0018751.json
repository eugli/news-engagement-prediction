We fell in love with it as a foreclosure, made an offer and unfortunately lost it to an investor. We were heartbroken. Nine months later when we still lived in our old house, our realtor reached out to let us know that the investor ran out of money after doing a few of the major fixes (HVAC, Plumbing, Master Bath, etc..) and it was back on the market! We jumped at the chance, went to see it again and had an accepted offer later that day. We moved in and renovations began, and as crazy as it was with three kids under four, the beautiful horses in our back yard kept us believing that this was the house for us! We gutted and remodeled the kitchen, added a new 600 square foot deck across the back of the house and are in the process of redoing all of the built-in bookcases. \nWe jumped at the chance, went to see it again and had an accepted offer later that day.

We love lots of white & natural light, accented with playful, vintage pieces & cozy textures. Our favorite things about the house itself are the sky lights, arch ways & old hardwood floors. We can't wait to continue renovating room by room & making it feel like home! \nThanks, Jessica! \n• Interested in sharing your home with Apartment Therapy?
