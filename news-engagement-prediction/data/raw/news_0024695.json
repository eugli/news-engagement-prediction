Photo: Getty Images \n\"Under international human rights law, governments are responsible for what they do, regardless of where they do it,\" said Hugh de Kretser from the Human Rights Law Centre. \nBut there are doubts the new obligations will extend to offshore centres. \n\"On the face of it, it will only apply to Australian detention centres - including Christmas Island, of course,\" barrister Julian Burnside told Fairfax Media. \n\"But if an international body wanted to assert that Australia runs the detention centres in Nauru and Manus, then the obligations would run to those places.\" \n\"But we know how Abbott responded the last time a [UN] special rapporteur said we were in breach of our obligations under the Convention against Torture.\" \nElaine Pearson from Human Rights Watch Australia said obligations should apply to both onshore and offshore facilities. \n\"Though the cynic in me says they will hide behind the argument that people are no longer 'detained' on Manus and Nauru due to slightly freer conditions of movement and also continue to hide behind sovereignty of Papua New Guinea and Nauru,\" Ms Pearson said. \nThe treaty - known as the \"Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment\", or OPCAT - is aimed at creating greater oversight for detention facilities across the globe. \nBen Saul, a professor of international law at the University of Sydney, said the new measures would make oversight of Australian detention more systematic and regular. \nBut he said it would be meaningless if the government did not act on the recommendations of inspections. \n\"This government has flatly rejected hundreds of previous UN findings about mistreatment in detention. It would be a miracle if the leopard changed its spots,\" Professor Saul said. \nThe UN human rights chief last year declared he was shocked by the abuse at Don Dale and called for compensation. \nSenator Brandis said ratifying the treaty would not mean taking away authority or responsibilities from states or territories. \n\"This will be an important reaffirmation of Australia's deep commitment to preventing torture and other mistreatment in our places of detention,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:15:22.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
