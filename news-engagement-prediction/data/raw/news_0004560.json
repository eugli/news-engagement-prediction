We see a country that in weaponising misinformation has created what we might now see as the post-truth age Sir Michael Fallon \nIn 2015, the German parliaments network was shut down, while the French channel TV5 Monde was taken off air. Both countries intelligence services have pointed the finger at Putin. But he warned there had been a “step change” as attacks mounted in 2016. \nCyber attacks are a major problem and the West needs to “call out” the messengers of “Soviet-style misinformation” like Sputnik news and RT. Defence Secretary visits UK nuclear submarine Fri, January 22, 2016 Defence Secretary Michael Fallon visits HMS Vigilant, one of the UK's four nuclear warhead-carrying submarines at Royal Navy’s Faslane nuclear base on the Clyde. Getty 1 of 17 Defence Secretary Michael Fallon visits HMS Vigilant at HM Naval Base Clyde, also known as Faslane in Scotland \nThe claims come in the wake of Trumps election campaign comments that Nato is obsolete. \nFallon added: “Nato must defend itself as effectively in the cyber sphere as it does in the air, on land, and at sea. So adversaries know there is a price to pay if they use cyber weapons.” \nThe speech comes after MPS, last Thursday, publicly savaged the Government’s ability to protect Britain from cyber attacks due to skills shortages and a severe lack of organisation. GETTY Britain has ramped up its cyber warfare budget \nThe Public Accounts Committee said the Government had taken too long to co-ordinate its “alphabet soup” of agencies involved in protecting Britain in cyberspace. \nMeg Hillier MP, chair, said: “The threat of cyber crime is ever-growing yet evidence shows Britain ranks below Brazil, South Africa and China in keeping phones and laptops secure.” \nYesterdays speech by Fallon is in direct contrast to the Committee chairwoman's comments that Downing Street needed to “raise its game”.
