The strikes also destroyed 13 watercraft like the ones the group has used to maneuver along the Tigris River , which divides Mosul into western and eastern portions. \nFarther north, near Irbil, a coalition strike destroyed an ISIS-held building and a weapons cache. \nAn Iraqi soldier with his weapon near corpses of ISIS militants killed in clashes in Mosul, February 6, 2017. REUTERS/Ahmed Saad \nIraqi forces recaptured eastern Mosul in late January, after three months of fighting that took a heavy toll on elite Iraqi units charged with leading the offensive as well as on Iraqi civilians , hundreds of thousands of whom remain in both sides of the city. \nWhile eastern Mosul is back in Iraqi government hands, many people in that part of the city say ISIS fighters remain and pose a deadly threat . Suicide bombers have targeted Iraqi troops and government-allied tribal forces, as well as restaurants and civilians on the eastern side of Mosul. \nDespite that latent danger, Iraqi forces early on Sunday kicked off the next phase of the campaign against ISIS in Mosul, as ground units advanced on villages southwest of the city, backed by US-led coalition air support and artillery fired by militarized police units . \n\"This is zero hour and we are going to end this war, God willing,\" Mahmoud Mansour, a police officer, told the Associated Press he prepared to move out on Sunday. \nAn Iraqi security forces member takes position during a battle with ISIS militants in Wahda district of eastern Mosul, January 6, 2017. Thomson Reuters \nBy early Monday, Iraqi units had reportedly pushed into the outskirts of western Mosul, including a village overlooking the city's strategically valuable airport . \n\"They'll try to cause as many losses as possible, because they know they're going to die anyway,\" said Alaa, an Iraqi trooper, referring to ISIS fighters. \n\"This battle of Mosul is my first, and with the help of God we will rid the country of these Daesh rats,\" he added, according to AFP, using an Arabic acronym for ISIS. \nThousands of US personnel are in Iraq assisting the government. In early January, a spokesman for the US-led coalition said the number of Western advisers in Mosul had doubled to about 450. \nUS personnel were reportedly near the front lines advising Iraqi forces during the fighting in eastern Mosul. US special-operations forces are also embedded with some Iraqi units, and they appear to be involved in operations against western Mosul. \n\"We are very close to it, if not already engaged in that fight,\" US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters in Abu Dhabi, according to the AP. He declined to go into more detail, saying he owed \"confidentiality\" to the troops. \nThe fight to retake western Mosul looks to be especially deadly. \nThat side of the city has older neighborhoods criss-crossed by narrow streets and alleys that will limit the use of armored vehicles. Moreover, hundreds of thousands of civilians — including 350,000 children — are believed to still be in that part of the city. \nAs many as 400,000 people could be displaced by fighting in western Mosul, and international aid groups are reportedly scrambling to prepare for the influx. \nIraqis flee the ISIS stronghold of Mosul, in al-Samah neighborhood, December 2, 2016. Reuters/Mohammed Salem \n\"We are racing against the clock to prepare emergency sites south of Mosul to receive displaced families,\" Lise Grande, the UN's humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, said in a statement. \nUS military officials on the ground there have spoken optimistically about efforts against ISIS in Mosul, and US commanders have praised the performance of Iraqi units. \nBut operations against ISIS in western Mosul have gotten underway amid the strain put on Iraqi-US relations by some of US President Donald Trump's comments and policies. \nMany in the country felt alienated by travel restrictions placed on seven majority-Muslim countries, including Iraq, by the Trump administration, and Trump's repeated comments about the US taking Iraq's oil as compensation for fighting there have inspired anger and indignation among Iraqis . \nMattis, who arrived in Iraq on Monday, said the US has no intention of seizing Iraqi oil.
