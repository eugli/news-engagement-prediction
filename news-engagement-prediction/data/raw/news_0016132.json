Abigail Williams Associate Editor, News & Emerging Platforms at The Huffington Post Bryan Bedder via Getty Images \nIt’s hard to believe that Nickelodeon’s hit series “Big Time Rush” has been off the air since 2013. Since the show’s finale and the boy band’s subsequent breakup , the former bandmates have been quite busy working on solo projects. Luckily, the guys still have time to catch up and hang out. \nKendall Schmidt met up with Carlos PenaVega on Wednesday to meet PenaVega’s two-month-old son, Ocean. PenaVega welcomed his son with “Spy Kids” actress Alexa PenaVega in December. \nSchmidt’s playdate with baby Ocean was simply adorable. Feb 1, 2017 at 4:25pm PST \n”’Uncle Kendall’ teaching little @oceankingpenavega how to raise an eyebrow...he’ll get it,” Schmidt captioned the photo. \nSchmidt and PenaVega also spent some solid guy time flying drones and listening to Schmidt’s new music. A photo posted by Carlos PenaVega (@therealcarlospena) on Feb 2, 2017 at 12:22am PST \n“An epic day catching up with @kendallschmidt!!” PenaVega wrote on Instagram. “Missed hanging dude. This picture says it all.” \nCould these two be any cuter? \nHere’s hoping Logan Henderson and James Maslow get in on the group hang next time!
