He rented a 110-square-foot studio apartment and wrote for more than 20 hours a day, imbibing energy drinks to keep awake and popping sleeping pills when he needed to nap. “I just stayed in that apartment, writing on three hours of sleep a night,” he said. “It was a big science experiment.” Mr. Yokoyama frantically pumped out four new books in five years, while also working on and off on the manuscript of “Six Four.” It takes its title from the reign of Emperor Hirohito (he ruled for almost 64 years), the father of the current Japanese emperor, Akihito, and denotes the year in which the cold kidnapping case at the center of the novel took place. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The punishing schedule caught up with him, and Mr. Yokoyama had a heart attack. As he gradually recovered and returned to writing, he could not even remember Mikami’s name. But long bouts tending his garden helped refresh him, and three years later, he finished the novel. The publisher Bungeishunju released “Six Four” in 2012, and Japanese critics praised it for subverting the traditional police procedural. In a culture where an increasing number of workers are frustrated by hierarchical bureaucracy, the novel was a big hit. At a dinner party in Tokyo, Jon Riley, editor in chief of Quercus, a London-based publisher that released the Stieg Larsson novels in Britain, heard of the novel’s popularity and commissioned an English summary. On the basis of that report, Quercus bought the rights to translate “Six Four” into English, and hired Jonathan Lloyd-Davies, an accomplished translator of Japanese fiction. Writing in The Guardian last year, Alison Flood described “Six Four” as a “slow burn” crime novel that provided a “layered insight into internal police politics.” The novel was shortlisted for an International Dagger Award for crime fiction. In the United States, where “Six Four” will be released by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in Mr. Lloyd-Davies’s translation, the publisher is planning an initial print run of 11,000 hardcover copies and hopes American audiences will be drawn to the discursive police drama. “Yes, it’s about a Japanese police department, and clearly it’s central to the story that it is Japanese,” said Sean McDonald, executive editor at Farrar, Straus and Giroux. “But I don’t think you need to be reading it because you’re interested in Japan.” David Peace, the Tokyo-based author of the crime novels “Tokyo Year Zero” and “Occupied City,” who was an early champion of the novel, argues that more such translations are vital, and not just for literary reasons. At a time when the United States and Britain are becoming “more inward-looking than they already are,” Mr. Peace said, “our need for translated literature and to try to understand other cultures and countries is greater than ever.” Mr. Yokoyama continues to work what he describes as “irregular hours” on a 15-year-old Mitsubishi desktop computer in a narrow room in his home that smells of tobacco and overflows with books, newspaper clippings, postcards and ink bottles. He proudly displays a baseball bat autographed by the Japanese baseball player Hideki Matsui. \nAdvertisement He said he was working on four or five projects. “I’m trying to finish them,” he said, “so they will be presentable to society.” \nHisako Ueno contributed reporting from Tokyo.
