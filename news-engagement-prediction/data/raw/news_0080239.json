And if you can't get out of your own way, you're not going to win anything.\"\n'That's the coolest thing ever' Guolla first fell in love with the extreme sport 10 years ago after seeing it on TV.\nOnly 16 years old at the time, he knew it would only be a matter of time before he'd be racing down the rolling hills and soaring over the kicker jumps.\n\"I thought, 'That's the coolest thing ever. I want to do that,'\" Guolla said.\nSure enough, he was hurtling down the track just two years later at a Crashed Ice event in Quebec City. But he admits things didn't go so well.\n\"I was horrible. I got really hurt — not really hurt, just bruised up pretty good — but I had a real blast and it was a lot of fun,\" he said. \"I knew I wanted to come back.\"\nDaniel Guolla, 26, sizes up the Red Bull Crashed Ice course next to Ottawa's Château Laurier ahead of the championship. Guolla will be the only local competitor taking part in the event in Ottawa March 3-4. (Hallie Cotnam/CBC)\nGuolla committed to improving his skills, playing junior hockey and hitting the ski hills throughout university. After graduating at age 22, he finally had the time and the opportunity to compete on the Crashed Ice world circuit.\nHe has since competed in places as far-flung as Russia and Northern Ireland, Finland and France, Germany and the United States. He has toured Canada, too, racing in events in Edmonton, Quebec City, and Niagara Falls, Ont.\nReady to impress a hometown crowd While Crashed Ice and its international competitions might seem glamourous, Guolla — who works full-time at the Rideau Centre's Nordstrom department store — insisted it's all about the love of the sport.\n\"No one's getting rich off this. It's a lot of guys who are athletic and like to compete,\" he said. \"And sign the odd autograph.\"\nDaniel Guolla points to the starting platform of the Red Bull Crashed Ice course next to Ottawa's Château Laurier. Guolla will be the only local competitor taking part in the event. (Hallie Cotnam/CBC)\nEyeing the course, Guolla hashed out a rough strategy.\n\"Whoever gets to that corner first is going to have a huge advantage,\" he said. \"It's kind of going to be a free-for-all.\"\nAs chaotic as the race may be, Guolla said he's keeping his cool and looking forward to showing off for the hometown crowd.\n\"No pressure at all, to be honest,\" he said. \"I'm just excited. All my friends and family are going to be here. Anytime I get the opportunity to skate down one of these courses, it's a real treat and it's a lot of fun.\"\nRed Bull Crashed Ice kicks off Friday, March 3, at 4 p.m. The finale will take place Saturday evening.\n. @CrashedIce is coming up fast!
