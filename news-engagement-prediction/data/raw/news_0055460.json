The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said the pricing along with customer experience determined by a telecom networks ability to take data traffic load will differentiate the winners from losers going forward. \n\"They have announced the pricing for the services, which is a good news for the industry, at least they have started charging. Our members will be giving their response but as an industry observer I can say that the industry will be relieved that price points have been announced. They are aggressive but not bad,\" COAI Director General Rajan S Mathews told PTI. Jio has announced that its existing subscribers and new customers who come on board by March 31, 2017, can continue to enjoy unlimited benefits of its Happy New Year Offer for one more year (that is March 31, 2018) by paying one-time fee of Rs 99 and Rs 303 a month. \n\"The Rs 99 plus Rs 303 is not a bad price point ... if the ARPUs (Average Revenue Per User) can be brought to Rs 300 from the current Rs 180...,\" Mathews said. In a speech broadcast live on the companys social media accounts, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani said Jio users had consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network, which is more than 3.3 crore GB a day. The Jio carries nearly 5.5 crore hours of video daily on its network. \"The question is how much of load can the network take, given the hefty packages of data ... that will differentiate the customer experience,\" Mathews said, adding the investment into the network to ensure that speed does not deteriorate will be critical. Ultimately, the price points and customer experience together will determine winners and losers going forward.
