She is the second child and eldest daughter of Alfred and Mary Joyner. Her parents were still in their teens at the time, and struggled to provide for their growing family. They christened their first daughter Jacquiline after then-first-lady Jacqueline Kennedy . The family story is that one of her grandmothers had declared that \"Some day this girl will be the first lady of something.\" \nAs a child, Jackie was growing up too fast for Mary, who knew the difficulty of life as a teenage mother. Jackie has said that \"even at 10 or 12, I was a hot, fast little cheerleader.\" Mary told Jackie and her older brother, Al, that they couldn't date until they were 18. Jackie and Al focused on athletics instead of dating. Jackie enrolled in the new track program at the local Mary Brown Community Center, where she had been studying modern dance. \nJackie and Al, who went on to win gold at the 1984 Olympics and marry star runner Florence Griffith, became each other's training partners and support. Al Joyner recalls that \"I remember Jackie and me crying together in a back room in that house, swearing that someday we were going to make it. Make it out. Make things different.\" \nJackie didn't win many races at first, but she became inspired when she watched the 1976 Summer Olympics on television, and decided that \"I wanted to go. I wanted to be on TV, too.\" At the age of 14, Jackie won the first of four straight national junior pentathlon championships. \nAt Lincoln High School she was a state champion in both track and basketball -- the Lincoln High girls' team won by an average of more than 52 points per game in her senior year. She also played volleyball and encouraged her brother in his athletic career, and she graduated in the top ten percent of her class. \nJackie chose to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) on a basketball scholarship, entering in the fall of 1980. That year, her mother died, suddenly, at 37, from meningitis. After her mother's funeral, Jackie determined to work even harder, to honor her mother's desire for her success. \nWhen she returned to college, she was offered comfort by Bob Kersee, an assistant track coach. Jackie later said, \"He let me know he cared about me as a person as well as an athlete.\" \nKersee saw Jackie's all-round athletic potential and convinced her that multi-event track should be her sport. He was so sure of her talent that he threatened to quit his job if the university did not allow her to switch from basketball to the heptathlon. The university agreed, and Kersee became Joyner's coach. \nIn 1984, Jackie Joyner won the Olympic silver medal in the heptathlon. In 1985, she set an American record in the long jump, at 23 ft. 9 in. (7.45 m.). On January 11, 1986, she married Bob Kersee and changed her name to Jackie Joyner-Kersee. She went on that year to set a new world record in the heptathlon at the Goodwill Games in Moscow, with 7,148 points, becoming first woman to surpass 7,000 points. She beat her own record just three weeks later, scoring 7,158 points in the U.S. Olympic Festival in Houston, Texas. For these achievements, she received both the James E. Sullivan Award and the Jesse Owens Award for 1986. Jackie Joyner-Kersee won many more events, titles and awards over the next fifteen years. \nShe retired from track & field competition on February 1, 2001. She is the founder and chair of the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Foundation, created to provide youth, adults, and families with the resources to improve their quality of life and to enhance communities worldwide. In 2000 the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Foundation opened the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Center in Joyner-Kersee's hometown of East St. Louis, Ill. The JJK Center provides services to thousands of families and youth in the metropolitan St. Louis area. Joyner-Kersee also travels widely as a motivational speaker. \nAmong her honors: Women in Sport Trophy, International Olympic Committee (IOC), 2007 USA Track & Field (USATF) Hall of Fame, 2004 International Women's Sports Hall of Fame, 1993 Athlete of the Year (first woman chosen for this honor), Sporting News, 1988 Sportswoman of the Year, US Olympic Committee (USOC), 1987 Female Athlete of the Year, Associated Press, 1987 Woman Athlete of the Year, Track & Field News, 1986, 1987, 1994 Broderick Cup (top female collegiate athlete in US), American Athletic Union (AAU), 1984-85", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:49:11.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
