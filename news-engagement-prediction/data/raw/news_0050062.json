The BBC is to invest an extra £8.5m a year in English language television programmes for Wales. \nIt follows a campaign to boost spending in the area, with politicians and lobbyists calling for an extra £30m . \nThe BBC said the new investment was a 50% increase and would fund new drama, comedy and entertainment programmes. \nBBC Director General Tony Hall said: \"BBC Wales has a remarkable creative track record and I know they'll seize this new opportunity with real relish.\" \nLord Hall added that he believed the investment would be \"transformational\". \nHe said: \"In areas such as drama, comedy and entertainment, we expect to more than double investment. In news and current affairs, it will help us move faster online and reach out to younger audiences, and provide greater specialist reporting across our output. \n\"It's so important that the BBC captures the real diversity of life and experience in Wales, and this investment is a real statement of intent about our ambition to serve all audiences in Wales.\" \nThe most recently published budget for BBC Wales English language TV was £22.5m in 2015/16.

Wales is blessed with superb storytellers, and this investment will give them a fitting national stage. \n\"By the time we move to our new home in Central Square in less than three years' time, I believe the difference on screen will be clear to audiences the length and breadth of our nation.\" \n\"The new investment package will also allow us to attract greater co-production investment, using the collaborative models we've developed with S4C and others to fund series like Hinterland.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T20:34:56.945+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
