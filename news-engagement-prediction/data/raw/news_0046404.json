Trish O'Donnell \nShe said in the correspondence that she believed her position was untenable and a “Trojan horse” agenda was underway. \nA ‘major’ fall out between Ms O’Donnell and a new chair of Governors is also understood to have added to tensions at the school in recent months. \nBosses at Oldham Council confirmed an investigation into Ms O’Donnell’s claim had been carried out.

Debbie Abrahams (Photo: Andy Commins/Daily Mirror) \nDebbie Abrahams, MP for Oldham East and Saddleworth, said the duty placed on teachers to carry out the Government’s counter-terrorism Prevent strategy was ‘fraught with difficulties.’ \nSpeaking to the MEN, Ms Abrahams said: “I understand that investigations into harassment of the head teacher at Clarksfield Primary School have been undertaken by Oldham Council and also Greater Manchester Police (GMP). \n“I also understand that allegations that this amounted to a ‘Trojan horse’ plot have been investigated by Oldham Council, linking in with GMP’s Counter Terrorism Unit, and the Department for Education’s Compliance Unit, who concluded that there was no evidence to support this claim.

This is why, along with the council, other Oldham MPs, organisations and leaders, we continually work across our diverse communities whilst tackling underlying inequalities which ultimately fuel these tensions. \n“Unfortunately the new Prevent duty placed on educators to report people at risk of radicalisation is fraught with difficulties, as has been raised by David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorist legislation.” \nCoun Amanda Chadderton, Cabinet Member for Education and Early Years, added: “We take any allegations about our schools very seriously and always investigate in the interests of pupils, staff and parents. \n“The report into an Oldham primary school found no basis to the ‘Trojan Horse’ allegations. \n“At this time we also have no active investigations or concerns about any of the other schools the Sunday Times has asked about.” \nA GMP spokesperson said: “GMP has received information obtained by partners regarding a school in Oldham. We have passed on information to the relevant authorities which are looking into the matter.” \nA DfE spokesperson said: “We are already aware of the allegations raised in the report and we are working closely with Oldham council.” \nThe Manchester Evening News has tried to contact Ms O’Donnell.
