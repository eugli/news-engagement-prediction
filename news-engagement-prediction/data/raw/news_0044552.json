Emily Ratajkowski shot to fame in the Blurred Lines video (Picture: Star Trak, LLC) \nThe apparent hack has come to light after Wayne Rooney prostitute and Celebrity Big Brother contestant Helen Wood alleged she was sent the cache of photographs online – with the sender apparently begging her to include them in her Daily Star column. \n‘Last week, I was pondering along through life, when I received a DM on Twitter. No idea who this guy was, but had a peek all the same out of curiosity,’ she wrote in her column. \n‘Turns out, it was a link to Emily Ratajkowski’s iCloud pictures. This clown had inboxed me and asked that I release the full set of naked images in my column,’ she continued. \n‘To be clear, this wasn’t footage of a randy star salivating at the mouth wanging their bits about while fishing for a random on Skype for a sex sesh. This was private stuff, sent between two people,’ the former escort wrote. Emily is a campaigner for women’s equality (Picture: REUTERS/Carlos Barria) \nEmily – who shot to fame after featuring in the Robin Thicke Blurred Lines music video in 2013 – is a campaigner for women’s equality and has hit out at those who criticise female sexuality in the past.
