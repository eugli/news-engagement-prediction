At the time of the incident, police said, the train was not crowded and there was no need to stand so closely together. Story continues below \nAs the SkyTrain approached the Olympic Village Station, the young woman was allegedly sexually assaulted from behind. The victim told Transit Police she turned and saw the same man before moving away and leaving the train at the Yaletown Station. \nThe suspect exited the train at the same station as the victim and followed her, closely, up the escalator and out the fare gates. As he continued to follow her, the woman, who police said was very frightened, stepped to the side, forcing the suspect to step on the busy escalator. The victim said she saw the suspect look back at her several times before fleeing the station. \nShe continued to work and reported the incident to Transit Police. \nAn investigation was started and using CCTV footage, police were able to identify the suspect, who had no fixed address. A charge of sexual assault was approved and a warrant was issued for his arrest. \nOn Feb. 11, Transit Police on patrol in the area of Stadium-Chinatown recognized the suspect and took him into custody. \nDwight Travis Wells, was released from jail with conditions which includes: not carrying any weapons, not to be found on the Canada Line or Canada Line property and no contact with the victim. \nWells is described by police as a white or Aboriginal man that is six feet tall with a skinny build, shaved dark brown hair, narrow facial features and a large nose. Transit Police are asking anyone who may have had similar encounters with him to call 604-515-8300. \nWells next court appearance is scheduled for Feb. 28 in Vancouver Provincial Court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:07:10.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
