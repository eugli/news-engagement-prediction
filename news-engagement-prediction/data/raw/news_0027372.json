As owner and handler Patricia Trotter returned to the benching area after claiming the group, she had to call her driver and let him know that “Plan B” was needed. She’d be coming back for one more day. \n“This year, she’s had a great run,” Trotter told reporters later. “She’s one of the top hounds in the country right now, but I showed her in January to try to get her sharp and to peak her for the derby. Because this is the dream for everybody, the Big Apple.” \nMORE COVERAGE: At Westminster dog show, new breeds get exposure, new fans \nThough the winner of last year’s Toy group, Panda the shih tzu, was in the field, it was Chuckie the pekingese (GCHB CH Pequest Pickwick) who won this year, and with good reason. \nChuckie – “or Chuckles, or Chuck” – is the son of Malachy, the pekingese who won Westminster’s Best in Show in 2012. \n“Well he doesn’t really rule the house like Malachy,” breeder, co-owner, and handler David Fitzpatrick told reporters, before acknowledging everything it has taken to get Chuckie to this point. “It’s just something you do every day. You have to brush him, take him for exercise, you have to take care of him every day.” \nAftin the miniature poodle (GCHB CH Danfour Avalon As If) won the non-sporting group, and Rumor the German shepherd (GCH CH Lockenhaus' Rumor Has It V Kenlyn) took the herding group for the second year in a row. \nThat leaves the sporting, working and terrier groups to compete here Tuesday night, before the most coveted prize is awarded, Best in Show, which pits the seven winners of each group against each other for the event’s top prize. \nPHOTOS: WESTMINSTER KENNEL CLUB DOG SHOW Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:51:25.523+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
