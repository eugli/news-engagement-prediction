Article continues below \nThe Sun quoted the 36-year-old saying: “It is as real as it can be. I don’t like using the word hate. But I’ve never disliked anybody as much as him. \n“I really don’t like the guy or anything about him. Article continues below Jeff Stelling predicts the PL's top four and who will be relegated this season \n“I don’t like what he stands for or how he looks or his voice or his whole demeanour. He is just really annoying and tries to get in everyone’s face all the time.” \nHe stated that Bellew has not proved his worth outside Liverpool, while his own experiences in the heavyweight category would be enough to secure a win. \nHaye has been training in Miami with his personal trainer Shane McGuigan and has been pictured on social media relaxing on a £27million yacht recently, to which Bellew responded by saying: “While he is posing in the sun, I’m grafting in the cold.” \nThe duo have always been at loggerheads when they meet, with the pair exchanging blows during the official announcement of the bout last November. \nThe British Boxing Board of Control have since warned both boxers to maintain decorum before the huge showdown on March 4. \nThe former heavyweight champion continued: “He pushed me so I gave him a clip round the ear. He asked for an apology. What fighter wants an apology?” \nThe Hayemaker further insisted that the Liverpudlian has had it easier compared to his own struggles back in 2007 when he trounced Frenchman Jean-Marc Mormeck away in Paris to become the WBA and WBC king. \nThe 34-year-old won the WBC cruiserweight belt in May 2016 by knocking out Ilunga Makabu at Goodison Park. \nHaye added: “I had everything against me. \n“I had to win it abroad — but he had it all in his hometown. \n“I have fought a lot of strong guys in the past and I just don’t see how he is going to handle my power.” \nOnly time will tell who comes up superior as the boxing faithful awaits the enthralling encounter at the O2 Arena in London in under a fortnight. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
