FILE PHOTO | CHIP SOMODEVILLA | AFP In Summary Clinton has largely retreated from public view since the November 8 election. She has otherwise given little indication of what she might turn her hand to, although a confidante has ruled out another run for office. Advertisement More by this Author NEW YORK Hillary Clinton is putting her shock electoral defeat to Donald Trump behind her by publishing a book of essays reflecting on her life, the bruising 2016 campaign and the future. Publishing house Simon and Schuster said the currently untitled book would be published in the fall and was inspired by favourite quotations collected by the former secretary of state for decades. Clinton has largely retreated from public view since Trump's upset win in November shattered her hopes of becoming the first female commander-in-chief of the world's most powerful democracy. \"These quotes have helped me celebrate the good times, laugh at the absurd times, persevere during the hard times and deepen my appreciation of all life has to offer,\" she said in a statement released by her publishers. Clinton is the author of five previous books, most recently \"Hard Choices\" published in 2014, as well as \"An Invitation to the White House\" and \"It Takes a Village\" all published by Simon and Schuster.
