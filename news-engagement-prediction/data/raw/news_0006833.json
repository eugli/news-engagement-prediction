Lacson has since been cleared. File photo \nMANILA, Philippines – Fugitive former police superintendent Cezar Mancao has surrendered to authorities, a Philippine National Police official confirmed on Wednesday. \nSenior Superintendent Belli Tamayo said Mancao of the defunct Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force submitted himself to the Crime Investigation and Detection Group on Monday. \nMancao was escorted to a court to return the arrest warrant issued against him, Tamayo added. \nMancao, accused in the murder of publicist Salvador “Bubby” Dacer and driver Emmanuel Corbito in November 2000, is currently under the custody of CIDG while waiting for a commitment order from the court. \nHe was in government custody but managed to escape detention at the National Bureau of Investigation in 2013. He had been scheduled to be transferred to the Manila City Jail and he said he feared for his life. \nHe and Michael Ray Aquino used to be with Sen. Panfilo Lacson in the PAOCTF. Lacson, who was Philippine National Police chief under President Joseph Estrada, was previously implicated in the Dacer-Corbito case but has since been cleared by the Court of Appeals. Headlines   \nLacson went into hiding for about a year when the case was revived during the Aquino administration and before the CA cleared him. Sen. Leila De Lima was the secretary of justice during that time.
