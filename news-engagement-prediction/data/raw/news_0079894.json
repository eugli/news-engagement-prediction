Slot to 247Sports Links \nWhen Gonzaga won at Saint Mary's, the Bulldogs were an overwhelming favorite to reach at least the conference tournament, and possibly the NCAA Tournament, undefeated. \nBut the Bulldogs, who collected 59-of-65 first-place votes in last week's Associated Press Top 25 Poll, were upset at home by BYU, not only ruining Gonzaga's undefeated dream but booting the one-loss Bulldogs from the top spot in the polls as well. \nThat left the top spot open for Kansas, which landed a surprising landslide of the first-place votes as well, with 58. The other first-place votes were split between No. 2 Villanova, which stood pat in its spot despite losing to Butler, No. 3 UCLA and No. 4 Gonzoaga. North Carolina rounded out the top five, but didn't collect any first-place votes. \nAs for a team to watch, keep an eye on No. 21 Wichita State, one of the nation's hottest teams and yet a squad not in CBS Sports bracketologist Jerry Palm's projected NCAA Tournament field. \nAssociated Press Top 25 Poll 2/27 \n1.
