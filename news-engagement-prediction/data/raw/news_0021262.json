The Nokia 6 is exclusively available in China through major retailer JD.com, which already put the phone on sale several times.Each time the Nokia 6 was made available for purchase, it sold out extremely fast because JD didn't have enough supply to meet the demand. The good news is HMD hopes be able to ramp up the production of the Nokia 6 since the Chinese New Year holiday is almost over. Actually we have been updating the inventory on JD.com more than 3 times but those were usually gone within minutes or hours, so that’s why you have the impression that we were doing flash sales. We will keep supply to JD for sure and now the Chinese New Year holiday is mostly over and everybody’s back for work, you can expect more supplies in the coming days and weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T07:39:17.693+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
