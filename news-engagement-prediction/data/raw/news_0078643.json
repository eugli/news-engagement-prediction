Democrats previously held control of all three after the 2008 election that sent former President Barack Obama to the Oval Office. That power began eroding in 2010 amid the Tea Party movement. \n“You know, in a certain way, I hate to see it, because I like a two-party system, and we’re soon going to have a one-party system,” Trump said. “I actually think a two-party system is healthy and good.” \nHe added of Pelosi: “But she’s done a terrible job.” \nVIDEO: TRUMP GIVES A TOUR OF THE WHITE HOUSE \nA Pelosi spokesman countered Trump in a statement later Tuesday morning, accusing the president of “projecting his incompetence” onto the lawmaker. \n“As Leader Pelosi stated yesterday, this President came into office promising bold action on jobs. Forty days later, the American people see nothing but a squandered four weeks in which this President has done nothing but instill fear,” Drew Hammill said. “In classic fashion, the President is projecting his incompetence on to others. Instead of calling people names, President Trump should focus on how he’s going to grow the American economy and live up to the promises he’s made to the American people.” \nAsked specifically about Pelosi’s earlier accusations that Trump hadn’t accomplished anything of value during his first few weeks in office, Trump said Pelosi was not “a good spokesman.” \n“She’s certainly wrong,” said Trump, whose flurry of executive actions have prompted nationwide protests from opponents and cheers from supporters. “There are those that say I’ve done more than anybody in 100 days.” Advertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T17:16:53.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
