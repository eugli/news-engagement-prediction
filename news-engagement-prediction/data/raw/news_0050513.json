Planning needed to prevent animals getting trapped \nThe SES' David King said better planning for floods on farm could reduce the risks. \nLivestock often get trapped in the corner of a paddock because there is not a gate, or it has not been opened ahead of the flood. \n\"Knowing there's a flood coming, either open gates or move your stock,\" Mr King said. \n\"Animals are fairly resilient. They can swim and move to higher ground.\" People ignore risks of floodwater \nMr King has been rescuing people and animals from floods for three decades. \nHe said flood rescues were among the most dangerous things the SES did, and he wanted young men especially to avoid going into floodwater. External Link: Peter drove into flood water to impress his girlfriend \n\"They have this sense they are bomb-proof,\" he said. \n\"They see a bit of water on the road and they think, 'This'll be fun, we'll make a few waves, spray a bit of water around' and they don't realise that road has been washed away.\" \nResearch shows people often underestimate the strength and depth of the water, and drivers cannot tell what is under the surface. \nTwilight is an especially dangerous time because people are prepared to take risks to get home, and the majority of deaths happen in minor and moderate flood events because people underestimate the risk. \nMr King said people, especially children, should stay out of floodwater because it was toxic. \n\"As soon as we get flooding we're getting septic tanks and sewage treatment plants overloading, and here are these kids swimming around in this biological porridge of faecal matter and they don't realise it,\" he said. \nThe campaign includes stories by survivors, including a mother who crossed a flooded river based on pressure from her passengers, a mother who turned around based on fear of putting the lives her children at risk, and a 4WD enthusiast and his experience crossing creeks and rivers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:17:31.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
