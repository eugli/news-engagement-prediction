For Los Angeles, let's call 2016 the year of the skyscraper. The 73-story Wilshire Grand Center was crowned with a decorative spire that reaches a height of 1,100 feet, making it the tallest building in Los Angeles. It edged out the US Bank Tower for that title, but not to be outdone, the bank tower made news headlines around the world with the opening of a hair-raising glass slide attached to its exterior, dropping from the 70th to the 69th floorâ€”nearly 1,000 feet in the air. Meanwhile, developers, by our count, filed plans over the past 12 months to construct nearly one dozen impressively tall towers. More than half would rise above 40 stories, earning them the designation of \"skyscraper.\" The tallest of these would climb 60 floors, so for now, it's looking like the Wilshire Grand and US Bank Tower will remain the queens of LA's skyline. But the competition is certainly heating up. In the first two months of 2017, developers floated plans for a 66-story mixed user next to Hotel Fig and a whimsical, 52-story tower off the 10 freeway. To get a sense of just how much LA's skyline is likely to change, we've mapped all of the skyscrapers and tall buildings that are planned and under construction right now. 1 73 stories: LA's tallest building \nConstruction of The Wilshire Grand Center, the new tallest tower in Los Angeles, is nearly finished. It's earned that title, because it has a 295-foot tall beacon that crests above the U.S. Bank Tower. The 73-story Wilshire Grand will hold 900 luxurious hotel rooms, a 70th-floor sky lobby, a rooftop pool, office space, and ballrooms.
