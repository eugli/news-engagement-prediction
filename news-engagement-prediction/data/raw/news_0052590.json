The mining giant also raised its dividend. (BHP Billiton) Reprints \nMining giant BHP Billiton ( BHP ) reported better-than-expected fiscal first-half earnings early Tuesday and raised its dividend. \nBHP Billiton earned $3.244 billion in underlying six-month profit, a 687% year-over-year gain and topping analyst forecasts for about $3.14 billion. Revenue jumped 20% to $18.8 billion. BHP also raised its interim dividend to 40 cents a share, up 150% vs. a year earlier and also above some views. \nGovernment mediation between BHP Billiton and striking workers at the Chile's Escondido mine broke down Monday. Workers have been striking for nearly two weeks. But that's helping to push up copper prices. So is a standoff between copper miner Freeport McMoRan ( MO ) and Indonesia. The Grasberg mine, the world's No. 2 copper mine. Assuming the export halt continues, it would cut Freeport's Q1 copper production by 17% and gold output by 59%. Freeport already missed fourth-quarter earnings estimates. Rio Tinto ( RIO ) also has a significant interest in Grasberg. \nIron prices have hit a 21-month high, fueled by strong Chinese demand. Rio Tinto said last week that it doesn't expect iron ore prices to \"fall off a cliff\" due to China. \nBHP Billiton shares fell 1.7% to 40.28 in stock market trading Friday after rebounding from its 50-day line nearly two weeks earlier. Freeport slid 1.1% on Friday, a day after falling below its 50-day. Rio Tinto sank 1.4% while Vale ( VALE ) rose 1%. \nRELATED: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:15:35.406+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
