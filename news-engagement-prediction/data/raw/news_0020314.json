Keep your eye peeled: There is a single one-eyed Jack hidden in this scattered deck of cards but only the most eagle-eyed will be able to pick it out The Jack of Spades is in fact tucked away behind a Queen and Jack of Hearts, towards the left-hand side of the puzzle.

Only those with a keen eye will be able to spot all of the words in the busy winter scene Once one word is found several more should emerge to the viewer with 'cut' hidden in the windows of a tower block, 'now' in a boys yellow scarf and 'man' in one of the bushes. The final two words can be spotted on two children in the left hand side of the scene with 'cool' hidden in a girl's blonde curls and 'tell' on a boy's green jumper. This is just the latest brainteaser to leave the Internet scratching its head with vintage puzzles proving increasingly popular. It is claimed that only one per cent of the population will be able to spot the hidden assassin in this vintage illustration A recent image, posted to Playbuzz , features a man drawing a gun as he prepares to engage in a duel, while a group of bystanders look on - but where is his adversary?
