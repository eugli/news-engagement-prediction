Lyla was diagnosed with microscopic polyangiitis, and was on dialysis for 12 hours a day.\nDespite her family's nationwide search for a match for Lyla, the results came back negative for a compatible donor . Because of multiple blood transfusions, it was more difficult to find an exact match for her, according to reports.\n\"She deserves a normal life, one where she can learn and explore, like any other 5-year-old,\" Battista explained. Inspired by Lyla's story, she decided to see if she was a match, and she was.\nTo break the good news to Lyla’s mom Dena Carreyn, she wrote her a heartfelt note: “I may just be her teacher now, but soon a little piece of me will be with Lyla forever. I’m Lyla’s kidney donor.”\nEcstatic, the pair could be seen embracing over the good news in October.\nJust months later, both Battista and Lyla are now well on their way to recovery.\nWatch: Boy, 2, Gets Kidney From Parents' Former Classmate Who Saw Their Facebook Plea\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/21515-boy-2-gets-kidney-from-parents-former-classmate-who-saw-their-facebook-plea", "http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/20641-a-sheriffs-sergeant-gives-a-kidney-and-the-gift-of-life-to-a-friend-and", "http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/19369-teacher-determined-to-raise-65g-to-buy-every-student-at-her-school-a-bicycle-by", "http://www.insideedition.com/", "http://www.uwhealth.org/news/preschool-teacher-donates-kidney-to-student/50368", "http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/swflash.cab", "http://www.insideedition.com/headlines/14633-woman-who-reunited-with-preschool-sweetheart-online-goes-wedding-dress-shopping"], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:49:30.871+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
