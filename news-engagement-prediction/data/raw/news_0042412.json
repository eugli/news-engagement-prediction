He spent last night in custody after his lawyer failed to secure his release. \nAlthough details of his alleged crimes will be revealed in court when the municipal manager applies for bail‚ the Daily Dispatch reported that it has reliably been informed that Tantsi’s arrest relates to a R10-million tender Mnquma issued two years ago. \nA company won a tender to supply the municipality with refuse bags. It is alleged the prices of the rubbish bags were inflated to the point where a packet of 20 was sold to the municipality at a cost of between R185 and R192 when they only retail for about R20 to R30. \nOf the R10-million the company received‚ more than R2- million was paid to three people with code names as a form of alleged kickbacks. \n- TMG Digital/Daily Dispatch Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
