And that means there’s one plausible scenario where neither Las Vegas nor gambling fans win. \nVia OddsShark.com : The total is at 59 in Las Vegas and 58.5 at most online shops with a couple of 59s out there online also. That would make a 31-28 Pats win a rotten result for sportsbooks, who would have to refund every spread bet on a push and any of their bets at 59 on the total would also result in a push. \nWith these teams evenly matched, Vegas opened the line with at Patriots -3 and hasn’t budged. That’s dangerous, since three points is such a common margin of victory in the NFL; the lack of a half-point on the total over-under compounds that risk for gamblers and Vegas alike. On the other hand, only four of the past 20 Super Bowl point spreads and just five of the past 20 total over-unders have featured a half-point on the line. Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports \nIn case you’re not a sports gambler, the spread and the over-under both typically come in half-point increments, because you’re essentially betting whether you think a team will win by more or less than the given point spread. If you “take” a team as a 3.5-point favorite, you’re saying they will win by more than 3.5 points — which, in practice means four points or more, unless we figure out a way to score half-points in football. \nSo if Vegas thinks a team is a three-point favorite, a sportsbook might list that spread at either 2.5 or 3.5 points, depending on how strongly the oddsmakers feel in one direction or the other. Otherwise, a three-point favorite that wins by exactly three points is a tie, with neither side winning the bet. AP \nIn those instances, the sportsbook returns the total bet to the bettor in a “push,” which would happen with both the spread and over/under in that aforementioned scenario where the Pats win 31-28 “If that’s the score, we will be refunding tickets until 4 a.m.,” CG Technology vice president of risk Jason Simbal told ESPN.com . \nThen again, there’s another way to look at this: the slim possibility of a 31-28 Patriots victory on the dot gives you a slight chance of freerolling with your Super Bowl bets this weekend. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T00:23:54.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
