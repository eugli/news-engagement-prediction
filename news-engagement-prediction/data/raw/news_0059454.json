What Marine Le Pen’s plan for France means for the EU \nAfter blockading their high schools, protesters marched and gathered at La Nation square, some carrying signs and banners condemning police brutality. \nThe school blockades were sparked by an incident earlier this month in a Paris suburb, in which a 22-year-old young black man named Theo was allegedly brutalised by police officers during his arrest. \nAn unauthorised demonstration was organized at Place de la Nation in Paris later on Thursday, also to protest against police brutality. \nA few weeks ago, violent clashes between young people and the police erupted in the suburb of Bobigny. Similar protests took place in Aulnay-sous-bois where Theo was arrested. \nPresident Francois Hollande visited Theo in hospital on Feb. 11 to show support. © 2017 Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:29:37.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
