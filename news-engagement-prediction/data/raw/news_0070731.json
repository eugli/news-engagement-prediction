But estate agents say more recently the reforms – as well as uncertainty over Brexit – have caused the top end of the housing market to stall. Concerns about the impact of the slump on tradesmen led Celia Sawyer, an interior designer and presenter of Channel 4 show Four Rooms, to commission accountancy firm PwC to crunch the numbers. The latest evidence of the collapse in stamp duty comes as Chancellor Philip Hammond faces pressure from estate agents and MPs to reverse the tax grab Concerns about the impact of the slump on tradesmen led Celia Sawyer, an interior designer and presenter of Channel 4 show Four Rooms, to commission accountancy firm PwC She said: ‘The Government needs to recognise that its stamp duty reforms on more expensive homes have backfired. The Chancellor should reverse these tax hikes as soon as possible to get the market moving again.’ Miss Sawyer, 50, has the backing of Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg. He described Mr Osborne’s ‘punitive’ stamp duty hikes as the ‘politics of envy’, adding that they have also failed because they have raised less money for the Treasury. Under the system a £1.5million property will incur duty of £93,750 compared to £750,00 before the changes. A £2.5million property will incur tax of £213,750, up from £175,000. Estate agents have called for the Government to reverse the stamp duty hikes on more expensive properties. They point out that many people who own homes worth £1million or aspire to buy them are not wealthy. Many are based in parts of the country where property prices have soared. Charlie Willis, senior partner at Strutt & Parker, described the stamp duty rise as a ‘kick in the teeth for the squeezed middle’. ‘It’s a punitive tax that stops movement,’ he said. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Lower transactions in recent months are likely to reflect wider factors in the housing market. The top end of the market is affected by a range of international and economic factors, but overall our reforms have reduced stamp duty for 98 per cent of homes bought.’ Share or comment on this article 54 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:17:35.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
