He intended to play a few holes and decided to play longer,\" spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \"He also had a full day of meetings, calls and interviews for the new NSA, which he is continuing today before returning to Washington, D.C., tonight.\"\nThe correction comes after professional golfer Rory McIlroy told golf blog NoLayingUp.com that he played 18 holes with the president on Sunday.\n\"He probably shot around 80. He's a decent player for a guy in his 70's!\" McIlroy said, adding that he was not approached by Trump about playing golf until Saturday night.\n  New York Yankees legend Paul O'Neill also joined the duo on the golf course, but reportedly did not play.\nTrump is wrapping his third straight weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in southwest Florida after arriving on Friday.\nTrump was very critical of former President Obama for golfing often, but he waited just two weeks before playing his first round as president. He most recently golfed with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:29:04.277+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
