And without a sufficient buffer they were quickly overhauled when Scotland hit their straps. \nFor all the talk of the pivotal weekend of the tournament and the rebirth of Scottish rugby, there is a fear in Wales that this season could be a watershed. Wales wing Liam Williams celebrates the opening try at Murrayfield \nWith the 2012 Grand Slam and 2013 championship wins now consigned to history, this team is at a crossroads. \nThere will be calls in Wales for changes and the blooding of new players, but that presents Howley and his backroom staff with a dilemma to which he alluded during his media conference. \nHe concedes that Wales' title challenge is over, but another defeat would make this Wales' least successful campaign since 2010 when they won two of their five matches. \nHe did not sound like a man ready to experiment.
