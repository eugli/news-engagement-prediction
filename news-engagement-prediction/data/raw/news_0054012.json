Whirlpool has also been advised to publicise the changed advice to consumers through advertisements in national newspapers, through social media and in stores. \nThe trading standards arm of Peterborough city council has been dealing with the alert because the company’s UK head office is located there. \nWhirlpool is in the process of replacing or repairing an estimated 5.3m potentially faulty machines across the UK – after identifying a safety defect in November 2015 caused when excess fluff touches the heating element. However, it did not issue a product recall, telling customers they could continue to use their tumble dryer while waiting for the modification, provided it was not left unattended. \nWhich? took the unusual step – the first time it has made a formal legal move involving trading standards – in order to assess the lawfulness of the decision to allow householders to continue to use faulty machines, despite the risk of them bursting into flames. It has now dropped the action. A fire at Bush Court, Shepherd’s Bush Green, London allegedly caused by a fauty Indesit tumble dryer. Photograph: @liam_twomey/PA \nAn investigation by the London Fire Brigade concluded that an Indesit tumble dryer was to blame for a serious blaze in an 18-storey tower block in Shepherd’s Bush, west London. \nThe fire chiefs – along with Which? and the Chartered Trading Standards Institute – urged Whirlpool to change its advice to customers so that any dryers waiting to be modified are not used. Whirlpool had rejected that advice until now. \nThe Whirlpool website now says “Trading standards confirmed, following an internal review by independent experts, that the modification programme remains the most effective way of resolving this issue. As a result, we will continue with our efforts to provide consumers with a free of charge modification as quickly as possible. The modification programme will continue. Trading standards have also notified us that updated usage advice should be communicated to affected consumers. If your tumble dryer is affected by this issue then you should unplug it and do not use it until the modification has taken place .” \nWhirlpool said in a statement: “Trading standards have now notified us that updated usage advice should be communicated to consumers and we are implementing this. Trading standards have confirmed that our actions to date in this campaign have been undertaken diligently and responsibly.” \nThe enforcement notices were issued by Peterborough Trading Standards on 16 January and were initially appealed by Whirlpool. If the company had not complied with the notices, it would have been taken to court. Sources told the Guardian that the latest action followed “an escalation” in the number of incidents caused by affected machines.

The government must now urgently address the issues with the product safety system as it shouldn’t need the threat of judicial review to ensure consumers are protected from dangerous products.” \nA spokesman for Peterborough Trading Standards said it had “ issued an enforcement notice to Whirlpool instructing them to change current consumer advice in relation to faulty tumble dryers. We are committed to the safety of the public and have a continuing duty to review our advice to Whirlpool.” \nThe spokesman said anyone who owns owns an Indesit, Hotpoint, Creda, Swan or Proline dryer manufactured between April 2004 and September 2015 should check if their appliance is affected and then register for a free modification if it is. \nIn the latest, serious incident, a Grade-II listed Georgian mansion in Kelsale, East Suffolk, was last week virtually destroyed following a major fire. It is thought the blaze which ripped through Kelsale Hall started in a tumble dryer and spread through the house. \nThe property was occupied at the time but those inside managed to escape and there were no reports of injuries, Suffolk fire service said. Thirty-five vehicles and 80 firefighters were called out to deal with the fire at its height. \nWhich? claimed in its application for judicial review that Peterborough Trading Standards had failed consumers by not properly carrying out its role as an enforcer of product safety laws. It believes that the handling of this case highlights problems with the current product safety system and the difficulties local trading standards branches face standing up to big business as effective enforcers. \nThe London Fire Brigade estimates there is one fire caused by white goods every day in the capital. The Local Government Association, which represents all fire authorities, says there are three fires a day caused by tumble dryers in England and Wales. \nWhirlpool tumble dryer owners can find out if their dryer is affected on https://safety.hotpoint.eu/ , https://safety.indesit.eu/ , and https://safety-swan.eu , or call a dedicated freephone helpline on 0800 151 0905 for the UK, or 1800 804320 for Ireland.
