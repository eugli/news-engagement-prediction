Ryan Gosling Had a Special Date at the Oscars, but It's Not What You Think February 26, 2017 by Caitlin Hacker 0 Shares \nRyan Gosling looked all sorts of handsome when he attended the Oscars in LA on Sunday night.

Ryan didn't attend the big show alone, however, as he brought along his older sister, Mandi. The cute siblings didn't pose together on the red carpet, but they did appear to have a good time inside the show. If Mandi doesn't bring Ryan luck to win best actor for his role in La La Land , maybe his interactions with Justin Timberlake will?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:48:13.409+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
