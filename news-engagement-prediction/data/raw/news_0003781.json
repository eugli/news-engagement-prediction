Sporting News \nUpdated at 4:49 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 4:49 a.m. ET \nAnthony Mundine has confirmed that he will not appear for the national anthem ahead of his re-match with Danny Green on Friday night. \nMORE: Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr.: At least we'll have 'Punch-Out!!' bout \nMundine had initially threatened to sit down in the ring during the playing of the anthem, however the 41-year-old has now revealed he won’t even be present between the ropes when Advance Australia Fair is performed. \n‘The Man’ has previously stated he does not agree with the wording of the national anthem, and is planning the protest because he is a proud indigenous man. \n“I ain’t coming out, man,” Mundine told the press on Wednesday. \nThe former rugby league star won the the pair's first bout and insists this time around, he will not stand for a “racist” national anthem, despite it being sung by indigenous singer Jessica Mauboy. \n“I didn’t really want to talk about it, the anthem, but a good friend of mine asked the question,” Mundine said. \n“And I’m an honest dude, a straight shooter. I can’t stand for something that’s racist. Advance Australia Fair , when it’s really Advance Australia White. \n“I’m about uniting and bringing people together, and living in peace and harmony. The first nation are disrespected [by the anthem] and throw the flag in there… somebody’s got to say something. \n“I ain’t coming out until it’s [been] played.” \nHis opponent said it didn’t bother him that Mundine wouldn’t be in the ring for the national anthem, while the bout’s organisers confirmed that Advance Australia Fair would be performed prior to the fight.
