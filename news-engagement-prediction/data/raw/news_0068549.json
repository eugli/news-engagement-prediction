India’s top diplomat is expected to raise two key problems that hit ties last year – China blocking India’s membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and opposing New Delhi’s repeated efforts to get Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar listed by the UN’s al-Qaeda and Islamic State committee. \nRead: It’s time India changed the foreign policy calculus with Pakistan and China \nThere’s unlikely to be progress in either case. \nOnly last week, China said there was no consensus among UN Security Council members as India hasn’t provided “solid evidence” against Azhar, accused by New Delhi of masterminding last year’s terror attack on Pathankot airbase. \nOn the NSG issue, China’s stand is that it wants to uphold the sanctity of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Since India is not a signatory to the pact, admitting it into the NSG would spell doom for the NPT regime - that’s what China has been saying and is likely to say during the strategic dialogue as well. \nIt‘s possible that China could raise the issue of India’s reluctance to come on board for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), President Xi Jinping’s ambitious, multi-billion dollar connectivity project over land and sea. \nRead: India-China talks: Masood Azhar’s UN ban, NSG row among 5 things on agenda \nBeijing is also likely to gently point out New Delhi’s long-standing diplomatic decision to follow the “One-China” policy and ask how that is impacted when India invites MPs from Taiwan, which China sees as a breakaway region to be reunited if necessary by force. \nTo some experts, the dialogue itself is a sign that the two countries are willing to engage. \n“It is particularly encouraging that the leaderships of China and India are aware of the important significance of a stable China-India relationship, having the consensus for an improved relationship between the two countries,” Guo Suiyuan, South Asia expert at the Yunnan Academy of Social Sciences, told Hindustan Times. \n“The strategic dialogue may open a new channel for improving understanding. It is much needed at this point of time for the healthy development of China-India relationship.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:11:50.596+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
