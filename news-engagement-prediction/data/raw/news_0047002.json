Next to it is Barber, walking her own puppy wearing nothing but her bra and undies – a confused man staring at her in the background. The caption reads: When you think you’re too hot for clothes but other people don’t agree.\nJennifer Lopez is the subject of another of Barber’s posts, the singer and actor effortlessly holding one of her kids in one hand, champagne in the other. Next to it is a picture of Barber, desperately drinking from a bottle of wine while one of her boys dangles from her arms.\nIt’s a perfect example of fantasy vs reality.\nmedia_camera Barber doing her very best Bella Hadid.\n“I’m excited for people who don’t find it hard or challenging — great, I’m really pumped for you, but those people are the minority,” she tells Insider.\n“You find that it’s a lot successful people that do it. They’re like: “I’ve had my baby and it’s a blessing, and they can come to work with me (work being model shoots!) and then we’re driven home in SUVs and then we get home and I can put my baby to bed and then we’re done and it’s amazing!’” she says.\n“That’s not life. You’re not taking your baby to work like a friggin dental hygienist is taking her baby to work. It’s not how it works.”\nBarber, a mother of two young boys and step-mum to two teenage girls, gets frustrated by depictions of motherhood by some celebrities who seem to forget how much help they get.\n“That’s what gets my goat. The whole new thing with ‘fancy people’ is to go ‘we’re just like you’ — no you’re not. The way you live is unattainable to most people. This is what it looks like when you’ve got kids and a husband and a job and school runs,” Barber says. “If I want to lie down for 10 minutes, I’ve got a kid on me. And I love it, I do, but don’t get me wrong, I’d love to be doing a sexy nude sleep alone.” Barber’s family often appear in her photos – especially ‘Hot Husband’ who even has his own page with more than 20,000 followers now (although she may or may not be the one driving that as well!).\nmedia_camera telling it how it really is, as opposed to Kourtney Kardashian.\n“He loves it – he’s very supportive and hilarious. He’s got his own page now. He’s got four posts and 23,000 followers. I’m just trying to exploit him to try and get money. Maybe Bonds will see how banging hot he is and go ‘here you go…’\nAnd her stepdaughter is the one who often has to suffer behind the camera — a task she says is pretty thankless and slightly awkward at times.\n“I’ll be half-naked in a compromising position and I’ll be like ‘is this ok?’ and she’ll just hand it to me and walk off,” she says. Barber started her wildly successful Instagram page about 18 months ago as a bit of fun and was shocked by how fast it started to grow in popularity.\n“I knew people would think it was funny, but I just though my people would think it was funny, like my mates,” she says.\n“I didn’t expect it to go gangbusters - but I’m pretty f***ing happy it has.”\nmedia_camera Barber’s posts gets tens of thousands of likes when she posts her photos on Instagram.\nShe’s also got some pretty high profile stars regularly checking in — Zac Efron a particular favourite of her stepdaughters.\n“I’ve had people like Chelsea Handler, Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer comment on my stuff — the people that I love,” she says.\n“In November I was in the States and had a really long lunch with Rosie Huntington-Whitely, the awesome model.”\nSome of those who she pokes fun of on her page are smart enough to know it’s better to get on board than be offended of Barber’s work.\n“The Kardashians are clever, they make sure they let the world know they like it,” she laughs.\nDespite so many followers and an army of celebrity fans, Barber admits the venture hasn’t converted into financial success.\n“I don’t make a cent — if anything it costs me.\n“Not. A. Cent,” she says.\nmedia_camera The surprising thing about Barber’s online success is that she hasn’t made a cent out of her Insta-fame. Picture: Darren Leigh Roberts\n“I don’t think people really know what to do me as in I’m not standing there holding a detox tea going ‘get into this, guys!’ I’m taking the piss so I don’t think there are many brands that want to associate with that.\n“The only people who have approached me to post for them on Instagram are a meal replacement or detox tea company and I have to ask them ‘um, do you know what I do? I don’t do that.’”\nBut Barber’s not too worried about that side of things at the moment.\nShe’s getting her name out there and there are other offers coming in that are a direct result of the page.\n“People kind of know who I am now and as an actor/comedian that makes me really happy.\n“I really like that so doors are opening up more for me now,” she says.\n“I get a bit of work from it but nothing regular. Nothing where I just sit at home and post a photo and go ‘bang that was fifty grand!”\nSo how does she come up with so many of the posts that regularly get tens of thousands of likes?\n“The ideas are everywhere. You put on the news and think ‘I’m going to find out what’s going on in Syria but you’re like oh no something’s going on with a Kardashian, what’s going on here?’\n“It’s everywhere, you can’t avoid it,” she says.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7c1d7dd6ae1d0a993674514c4ebe437d?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/16de37b541f3c4f2e1e8db48609f50ed?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_noGallery=true&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/29232f50119aeb38375010aa2c75f76a?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b2af72e9ad88050c9afd901aab3cad1d?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/dd485654b6686f213ca61e4b546d2830?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0d5b71dda1b8d1122e57b1c9b20b4752?width=650"], "published": "2017-02-18T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T09:08:43.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
