He was with our party and is a true samajwadi (socialist) and we are using his photograph in our campaign,” Lok Dal National Preisdent Sunil Singh said. \n“A number of his followers are contesting on our ticket,” a senior Lok Dal leader said. \nHowever, there was no confirmation from Mulayam Singh Yadav in this regard. \nLok Dal has already offered the embattled Samajwadi Party patriarch its symbol and national president’s post. \nSingh said his party in EC’s records was a registered, unrecognised party that was formed by veteran socialist leader Charan Singh way back in 1980 and “netaji” was its founder member. \nLok Dal has the old election symbol of ‘farmer ploughing field (khet jotta kissan)’, on which Charan Singh had become the chief minister of UP. \nIn 2012 elections, Lok Dal had contested 76 of the 403 seats and though its candidate did not win any seat, the party received 5,000 to 15,000 votes in most of the constituencies. \nIn UP, which is having a seven-phase polling beginning February 11, Lok Dal has decided to contest some 300 seats this time and 25-30 nominees are likely to be sitting SP MLAs. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:34:31.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
