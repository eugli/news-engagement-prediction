That left the Bulldogs with 17 commitments left to sign. All have done so plus UGA added a pair of defensive backs on Wednesday morning in Eric Stokes (Eastside) and Ameer Speed (Sandalwood; Jacksonville, Fla.), both of whom have been confirmed by the school.

The four-star linebacker is a double UGA legacy with his mother, Brandi Decker-Hunter playing basketball in Athens and his father, the late Brice Hunter, playing football. \nHunter is ranked as the nation's 137th overall prospect and as the ninth outside linebacker according to the industry-generated 247Sports Composite. He's also seen as the 13th overall prospect in Georgia. \nHis letter of intent, however, may not be the last one the Bulldogs receive. Mater Academy (Hialeah, Fla.) defensive back Latavious Brini , Grayson defensive back Jamyest Williams , and Clay-Chalkville (Pinson, Ala.) wide receiver Nico Collins are still on the board. 247Sports National Writer Ryan Bartow is also reporting that the Bulldogs may be a late player for Sebastian River (Sebastian, Fla.) defensive end Jarez Parks . \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
