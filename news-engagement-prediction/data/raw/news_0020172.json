On Jan. 28, the Victoria Police Department responded to a fire at the mosque just after 2 a.m. when a store clerk at a nearby convenience store noticed heavy smoke coming from the building, according to O.C. Garza, communications director for the city of Victoria. The fire fully engulfed the building and caused an estimated $500,000 in damages, according to the Houston Field Division of the ATF. It took firefighters about four hours to extinguish the blaze, which gutted the building and left only the outside facade of the mosque intact. Bob Daemmrich/Polaris The FBI, ATF and other agencies continue sifting through burned rubble of the Victoria Islamic Center mosque, in Victoria, Texas January 29, 2017, for clues. Although the fire was determined to be intentionally set, the evidence at this time \"does not indicate the fire was a biased crime,\" the ATF said. “Houses of worship are a sacred place in this country, and ATF is committed to devoting the necessary resources to solving this crime,” said Fred Milanowski, the special agent in charge of the ATF Houston Field Division. “We are working closely with our local law enforcement and emergency service partners on this investigation and ask that anyone with information about this incident please report it.” The ATF, along with the Victoria Islamic Center Mosque and Crime Stoppers, has offered a $30,000 reward for information leading to an arrest of the persons responsible, the ATF announced Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:49:13.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
