The GPU is based on the Pascal architecture and is capable of supporting up to 5K displays at 60Hz.\nThe new GPU is the fastest Quadro yet, with 32-bit floating point performance of about 12 teraflops via 3,584 CUDA cores. That outpaces the Quadro P6000, which delivers 10 teraflops of performance.\nThe GP100 also delivers 64-bit floating point performance of 5 teraflops via 1,792 cores for more precise calculations.\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:02:03.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
