I think that's one possibility.\"\nHowever, Clinton repeatedly expressed confidence in and a lack of concern for the FBI's handling of her case during the campaign. At one point, she praised the agency's professionalism .\nAfter Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination in July, she told ABC's David Muir she could \"absolutely\" assure the American people that nothing from the FBI investigation would alter the campaign.\nOf course, Clinton repeatedly said she never sent nor received classified information on her private email server, and she also said she took the classification process seriously.\nAlthough Clinton partisans initially praised FBI Director James Comey for his decision not to recommend charges against Clinton for mishandling classified material with her private server, they became harshly critical in October, when a last-minute announcement that the probe was being re-opened dominated headlines heading into Election Day.\n  Politics and tagged Clinton Email Scandal , Donald Trump , FBI , Hillary Clinton , James Comey , John Podesta  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:14:20.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
