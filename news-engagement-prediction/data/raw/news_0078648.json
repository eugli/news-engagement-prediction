In a sustained and brutal attack, you ended those lives and took away the futures of Zoe Morgan and Lee Simmons.”\n\nSaunders, from Newport in south Wales, thanked the judge as he was taken down to the cells at Cardiff crown court and apologised to the families in the public gallery. \nIn a victim impact statement, Morgan’s mother, Julie, said: “I think about her constantly and how she must have suffered. She was a beautiful, bright and hard-working girl.”\n\nSimmons’s father, Alfred, said: “Lee found love in Zoe and I’m so happy for that. I can’t look at the photographs I have of Lee as a child, it hurts too much.”\n\nThe judge was provided with a psychiatrist’s report that concluded Saunders was depressed at the time and may have been affected by a mental illness called adjustment disorder.\n\nWhen he was arrested he told police he was sorry but had snapped. “Your head is a weird thing,” he added. A school teacher described him as a “gentle giant” and he had no previous convictions or cautions. He was due to go to college in Canada on an American football scholarship.\nThe court heard that Saunders and Morgan had been in a two-year relationship but he was controlling and violent. Morgan broke up with him last July and began dating her colleague Simmons.\nThe couple were waiting outside the store on Queen Street shortly before 6am on 28 September when Saunders appeared. \nHe stabbed Simmons, who worked in the warehouse, with an 8-inch (20cm) knife. Morgan tried to pull Saunders away but he told her to get off before warning her: “I’m coming for you next.” \nMorgan, who worked as a window dresser, ran away after Simmons collapsed, but Saunders caught up with her. He took a second knife, measuring 10 inches, from his rucksack and stabbed her. Both victims had eight stab wounds. In total Simmons suffered 40 injuries and Morgan 32. \nWhen Morgan told Saunders their relationship was over, he accused her of cheating on him, adding: “I will kill whoever it is.”\n\nThe court heard that when he found out she was dating Simmons, Saunders contacted him on Facebook, saying that he would kill him. He sent abusive messages to his former girlfriend and also told her: “I love you still.” \nIn the weeks leading up to the murders, Saunders searched online for “the easiest way to kill a person”, “how many years for killing a person”, “16 steps to kill someone and not get caught” and “how long do murderers serve in prison”.\n\nA week beforehand, Saunders searched “Is it as easy to slice someone’s throat as they make it look in movies and TV shows”. He also searched for “how to blow up a car without being caught” and “how can a car be rigged to explode when started”. \nHe purchased an air rifle and 500 pellets. Saunders also bought two knives and latex gloves from a supermarket. These were used in the attack.\n\nAfter the killings he texted his father: “Thanks for being a pathetic, useless father. Just killed two people. Cheers.”\n\nOutside court, Kelly Huggins, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This was a brutal, unprovoked and premeditated attack. Saunders attended the location well before Zoe Morgan and Lee Simmons arrived that day and ambushed them.\n“As he brutally attacked them he also showed no concern for members of the public who were subjected to a frightening scene of violence.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:03:24.670+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
