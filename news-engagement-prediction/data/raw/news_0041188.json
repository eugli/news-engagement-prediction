I apologized to the Speaker and pleaded with him to conduct secret voting. But he did not budge,\" he told reporters on Saturday evening. \nBefore staging a demonstration at the Marina Beach, Stalin met Tamil Nadu Governor C Vidyasagar Rao and lodged a complaint against the happenings in the assembly. \n\"DMK had demanded secret ballot to decide on the motion of confidence moved by Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami,\" Stalin said while speaking to reporters after he and his party legislators were evicted from the House. \nHe said the party demanded adjournment of the House for a week so that legislators can go back to their constituencies and seek the people`s views before they come back to vote on the confidence motion. \nStalin also alleged that he was manhandled in the Assembly by the marshals on the day of the vote of confidence, which the Palaniswami government won with support from 122 MLAs against that of 11. \nThe DMK held protest in several parts of the state yesterday questioning the legitimacy of the government. \n\"It is a black day for democracy. This anti-people (AIADMK) government must be removed. Insisting that a peaceful protest is underway at the Marina. Those who want to remove this anti-democratic government should converge at the Marina,\" the DMK leader said in a statement.
