However, the White House has yet to provide evidence, at least publicly, to support the argument. \n“This morning, on this show, is not the venue for me to lay out all the evidence,” Miller said. “But I can tell you this: Voter fraud is a serious problem in this country.” \nThe issues of voter and voter-registratration fraud came into play again last week after a closed-door meeting with senators and former New Hampshire GOP Sen. Kelly Ayotte, who with Trump lost that state on Election Day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T04:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:45:26.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
