Eyewitnesses tell us it was PACKED -- so much so that Chris had to take a seat on some blond chick's lap for a while ... as Vanessa watched from a distance. \nSure enough, cops were called around 1:15 AM and spent almost 2 hours breaking up the party and writing up tickets. We're told soon after they showed ... Chris was already riding away in his whip. Hard to tell if Vanessa was with him. \nSeems like he wasn't trying to deal with more cops , especially so early in 2017. Can't blame him entirely though ... the place looked chaotic as hell.
