The National Heroes Acre is a burial ground where state funerals take place. \nMany saw Grace's utterances as her attempt to succeed Mugabe, after she also indicated last year that she was already \"president\" of the southern African country as she \"plans and does everything\" with the veteran leader. \nThis came as Zanu-PF was reportedly riddled with warring factions, as party leaders positioned themselves to eventually succeed the veteran leader.
