Music industry legend L.A. Reid will also give a speech on Duran’s behalf. \n“Next week will be one the greatest highlights of my career,” Duran tells PEOPLE. “I love what I do, I love the music, and I’m honored to be presented with a star by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.” \nHe adds, “And having the support of friends like L.A. Reid and Chris Martin is so surreal! I’m so grateful to have two of music’s most respected contributors by my side.” \nChris Martin and Coldplay have been close with Duran, who was an early champion of the band. Duran, who famously shed over 100 pounds three years ago, recently told PEOPLE that his most difficult celebrity interview ever was Madonna. \n“She just wouldn’t give a straight answer,” he said. “Maybe she wanted to be a bad girl just for the sake of being a bad girl.” But, the host added, “While I didn’t love it, I’d still love to keep interviewing her. I want to get it right!” Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:02:58.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
