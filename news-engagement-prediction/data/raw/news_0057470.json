We have families to take care of yet they [club management and government] push us all around. \n‘’They want us to win the league and play in the Caf Champions League, how are we going to achieve that when we are being starved? Enough is enough.’’ \nA staff of the Ondo State Football Agency who pleaded anonymity told Goal that the players will be reimbursed but will have to wait till another governor is sworn in. \n‘’We are not happy that we are owing these players but I can assure you, they will be paid as soon as possible. \n‘’Right now, it is very difficult for the government to release funds because they are preparing to move out for governor Rotimi Akeredolu who would be sworn in this week. \n‘’Hopefully, when he comes on board, everything will be settled and the players will all smile home. My appeal is that the players should not carry out their threat to boycott the league. \n‘’That will not be good for our image as a great team with bright potentials to compete for the league title.” \nThe players have vowed not to leave the Governor’s Office until they got firm assurance that they would be paid their allowances before Friday. \nThis recurring decimal will be recalled led to the mass departure of several players most notably Prince Aggrey, Tamen Medrano, Iyorha Luther and Musa Newman in 2015. \nSunshine Stars are two points away from the relegation zone with nine points from nine Nigeria topflight games. The forced Nasarawa United to a 1-1 in their last outing in Lafia.
