A copy of the complaint is being circulated in the media.\n\"Model Sofia Hayat ne kya Hindu Muslim dharm ka mazak udaya. Amboli Police station mein complaint dakhil (Why has model Sofia Hayat made fun of Hindu and Muslim community. Complaint lodged in Amboli police station),\" Patel tweeted.\nAccording to the complaint copy, Sofiya has disturbed the 'public peace and public tranquility and public order' by getting the swastika inked on her feet.\nSofia had shared a photograph of her feet with the swastika tattoo on Instagram earlier this week.\nAs the symbol is considered sacred by the Hindu community, Sofia courted outrage over social media.\nShe later took a stand for herself and wrote: \"May those with anger know that they only do the work of the devil in their anger. May those that say unkind words know that those words come from negative entities whether you call it an energy, the devil or anything else.\"\nSofia also then posted an image of another tattoo.\n\"And my final sacred tatoo... Allah Islam, peace. To be born is to be a Muslim... To be a muslim is to surrender... To surrender you come into knowing of divinity in you and all things in existence... And to know existence is to know Allah... To know Allah... Is to know the greatest love... to know this... you know PEACE... And love all things... for everything has a reason.\"\nSofia has appeared in shows like 'Welcome - Baazi Mehmaan Nawazi Ki', 'Bigg Boss 7' and 'Comedy Nights Bachao'.\nThis is the photo which got her in trouble\n  Ok..so my last photo was me having tatoos on my feet...the sacred swastika..found on the feet of BUDDHA.. the sacred .. eternal..self existence..the star of David..the Islamic moon..universal manifestation..the Sun..hindu swastika..ancient christian cross..buddhist..tibetan..it encompasses the all..the power of the universe at my feet so to at yours..wake up..we are one! A symbol is just a symbol and it is the intent that makes the difference. A scalpel in the hands of a surgeon is a tool in his profession can save a life; while in the hands of a perpetrator is unlawful possession of a weapon, in the eyes of the law, to commit a crime. In the Dahmmapada, Yamaka Vagga (The Twin Verses), Verses 1 and 2 straighten our minds and views on good and evil intentions. “Mano pubbaá¹ gamÄ mano, setthÄ manomayÄ ManasÄ ce padutthena, bhÄsati vÄ katoti vÄ Tato naá¸¿ dukkhamanvertÄ­, cakkaá¸¿’va vahato padam”. (Mind is the forerunner of (all evil) states. Mind is chief; mind-made are they. If one speaks or acts with wicked mind, because of that suffering follows one, even as the wheel follows the hoofs of the draught-ox). “Mano pubbaÅgama, mano setthÄ manomayÄ ManasÄ ce pasannena, bhÄsti vÄ karoti vÄ Tato naá¸¿ sukkamanveti, chÄyÄ’va anapÄynÄ­”. (Mind is the forerunner of (all good) states. Mind is chief, mind-made are they. If one speaks or acts with pure mind, because of that, happiness follows one, even as one’s shadow that never leaves). #templeofawakening #gaiamothersofia #spiritual #love #ayahuasca #dmt #awakening #conciousness #christ #ra #mothermary #shiva #goddessisis #auset #osiris #ra #trinity \nA post shared by Sofia Hayat.
