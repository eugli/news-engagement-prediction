The donation was made in her name as well as her son Zayed and her daughter Jalila. Taking to Instagram, Princess Haya first posted a series of tributes to her parents - especially to her mother whom she recalls to be fondly known as the 'Mother of the Poor'. Queen Alia passed away on February 9th, 1977.

Princess Haya wrote that the late Jordanian ruler will always be the father of the country in the hearts of its many residents. A photo posted by Haya Bint Al Hussein (@hrhprincesshaya) on Feb 7, 2017 at 12:58am PST After honouring her parents, she made the announcement earlier on February 10 that she will be donating to Tkiyet Um Ali - a charity organization that Princess Haya once chaired and established in the memory of her father to aid those in need. While the amount remains unknown, feeding 30,000 families is a task that requires a pretty penny.

In fact in 2016, she went out of her way to fly to Haiti to oversee the UAE's relief operations for families affected by Hurricane Matthew. Sheikh Mohammed was also there in spirit as he sent his personal jet to Haiti filled with 90 metric tonnes of aid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T01:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T17:50:43.398+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
