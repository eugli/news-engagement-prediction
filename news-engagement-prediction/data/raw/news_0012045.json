The deal has reportedly been in the works for a couple of weeks. \n“The San Francisco 49ers are very fortunate to be able to bring in a coach of the caliber of Kyle Shanahan,” said 49ers General Manager John Lynch in a statement. “As an offensive mind, I think he stands alone in the National Football League, as evidenced by the explosive and record-setting offense in Atlanta. Though he grew up around coaching, what has most impressed me about Kyle is that he’s become his own man in the profession. Our philosophies on football and our visions for leading the 49ers back to being a championship team align in every way. I am thrilled to have Kyle Shanahan on board.” \nLynch played a portion of his Hall of Fame career with the Broncos under Kyle’s father, Mike. \nShanahan, 37, has been the offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons for the past nine seasons, and is coming off of a rough performance in Super Bowl LI. He’ll reportedly have control of the 53-man roster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T03:15:40.684+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
