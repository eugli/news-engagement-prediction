And that is very difficult in the Premier League,\" said the midfielder, who scored City's final goal of their 4-0 midweek victory at West Ham. \n“All the time we have to be able to play as well — or you’ll be in trouble.

To be honest you have to understand when players have the desire to play and to improve the message from the manager to all the players all the time is do what you want. \n“It’s quite difficult for us, Chelsea have been playing one game a week and we are fighting in a lot of competitions so it is quite hard. \n“You see the solidity of Chelsea. A win at Liverpool would have made it very difficult for us but they didn’t lose. But we are not thinking about Chelsea we are thinking about us to be honest. Just get the job done and keep it going and perform like we did well.” \nToure insists he will also not give up on catching Chelsea in the title race despite these extra demands from Guardiola and the added pressure — which the league-leading Londoners do not have this season — of being in the Champions League's last 16. \nHe added: “When you look at me, I never give up. But football is not about the talk outside the pitch it is about what goes on on the pitch.\" Toure is still targeting a third English title this season despite Chelsea's 10-point lead (Photo: Getty) \nIt is a view echoed by City forward Kevin De Bruyne, who insists the players have not given up on the title even though Guardiola has effectively thrown in the towel by saying it is now Chelsea’s to lose. \nDe Bruyne claims that if his Mancunian Blues maintain their form they can still catch Conte’s men, who have 10 more points than them with 15 games each to play. \n“Football can go a little crazy sometimes,\" said the Belgian. \"They are far ahead but even if you lose three games and we win three games, you are there. Three games out of the 15 is nothing. \n“So we just have to do our thing and not look at what Chelsea and the others are doing. If we win our games we will have a good place and hopefully the best possible. \n“We are going to try. In the Premier League you have to be there every week. All the injured players are coming bad which I am very happy about as we have a lot of games with the league and Champions League.
