APC Logo \n“The current surge to join APC by our people is also a vindication of our true position that in the fullness of time, Ndigbo stands to gain more from President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration than they did in the past administrations,’’ she said. \nThe public secretary said that the mass exodus of politicians from other parties to APC was anticipated due to the people-oriented and corrupt-free administration of the APC led by Buhari. \n“For us, the exodus of the Igbo’s from other political parties into APC is a testimony and realisation that it is bad politics to put all our eggs in one basket, so no one ethnic group can benefit in isolation,’’ he said. \nOfor welcomed all `political heavyweights’ that had defected to APC in the South-East. \nShe noted that in no distance time, the Igbo’s would flood the APC in millions as they have done in other parties, where they had been strong pillars of support. \n“We welcome everybody, especially those who will contribute to the actualisation of more united, prosperous and progressive Nigeria,’’ she said.
