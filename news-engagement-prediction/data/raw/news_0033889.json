Authorities intercepted Doggart's alleged plot before anyone was hurt.\nHe's facing one count of solicitation to commit arson, one count of solicitation to commit a civil rights violation and two counts of threat in interstate commerce. But he's not facing any terrorism charges and has been on house arrest since his initial capture.\n'Sovereign national’ accused of plotting terror attack sentenced \nAttorneys representing the Islamberg community in a seperate civil lawsuit claim a loophole in federal law allows defendants such as Doggart to escape terrorism charges.\n\"There's a gap in the law,\" attorney Tahirah Amatul-Wadud told the Daily News on Monday evening. \"Frankly, there is nothing on terrorism unless it's connected to a foreign element. You won't see the KKK charged with domestic terror even though that's what they do.\"\nAccording to the Patriot Act from 2001, prosecutors can only charge a defendant with domestic terrorism if he or she had the intension to \"intimidate\" or \"coerce\" a civilian population, or influence the \"policy of a government\" to affect the conduct of government by \"mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping.\"\nProsecutors can more easily pursue terrorism charges if the alleged act of terrorism has a foreign element, for instance ties to international terror networks such as ISIS or al-Qaeda.\nSyrian President Assad welcomes U.S. to fight terrorism in nation \nThe two attorneys said they full heartedly believe Doggart's acts actually constituted terrorism.\nDoggart was accused of plotting to burn down a mosque in Islamberg, a predominantly Muslim community in upstate New York. (iqou-moa.org) \"He did it to intimidate Muslims throughout the country — a civilian population — and acted as if he was going to be the world police, which is very anti-government,\" Amatul-Wadud said, referencing the Patriot Act statue.\nAmatul-Wadud and her colleague, Tahirah Clark, who represent the Islamberg community in its attempt to get a permanent injunction against Doggart, said they're disappointed that terrorism charges aren't on the table. Nonetheless, they didn't blame federal prosecutors, adding that they believe the high legal bar is to blame.\nThe government rested its case against Doggart on Monday, and the jury was expected to begin deliberations on Tuesday.\nQueens ISIS wannabe pleads guilty to attacking FBI agent \nEven though he won't face terrorism charges, Amatul-Wadud said the Islamberg community is relieved that Doggart could face up to 10 years in prison.\n\"Finally, in a court of law, they are given a chance,\" Amatul-Wadud said of community members. \"That felt like vindication.\"\nDoggart has pleaded not guilty to the accusations against him.\nWith News Wire Services \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T07:21:58.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
