Man sends girlfriend bouquet of 'flowers' made of £1,100 in bank notes \nWhy? We hear you ask. Well, it’s for no better reason then she thought it would ‘look good’. \nAnd the body piercer seems impressed with the results, posting this week that the wound was ‘healing so well and totally love it.’ \nIf she looks familiar it’s because it’s not the first time Torz has hit the headlines, having previously sliced off a tattoo with a scalpel and sent it to her ex-boyfriend.

It’s not hurting ANYBODY else. \n‘I chose to document them on Facebook because I want to share the experience with my friends.’ A post shared by Torz Reynolds (@torzibabes) on Feb 10, 2017 at 7:07am PST A post shared by Torz Reynolds (@torzibabes) on Feb 14, 2017 at 3:17am PST More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:31:23.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
