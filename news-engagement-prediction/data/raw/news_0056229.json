She hit back saying Narendra Damodardas Modi stood for “Negative Dalit Man”. Addressing a rally in Sultanpur, Mayawati said: “I don’t like to indulge in jumlebazi (play of words) like the Prime Minister. But today, I have to give a tit-for-tat. Narendra Modi’s full name is Narendra Damodardas Modi…N stands for negative, D stands for Dalit and M stands for man. It means that Shri Narendra Damodardas Modi is an anti-Dalit man not by character, face, intention and policy, but also by his name. It is important for people to remain vigilant about his negative thinking and deeds.” \nMayawati is campaigning for the BSP ahead of phase 5 of the Uttar Pradesh polls. Polling for the 52 Constituencies begins on February 27. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:09:59.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
