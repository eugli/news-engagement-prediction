Advertisement \nIn response, Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, declared that, \"If a minority candidate leaves his group representation constituency (GRC), a by-election will not be called\". \nMr Chan added that the GRC system, which has been in place since 1988, makes it compulsory to include at least one member of a minority race in each team. \nThis was to ensure enough minority members in the House. This, Mr Chan said, had been achieved over the years. \nSecondly, this was to ensure \"that we will all, regardless of party lines, campaign on the basis that we are all Singaporeans, that we will not use race, language or religion for political reasons\", Mr Chan said. \nElected members are expected to serve all residents, regardless of race, language and religion as well. \nThese key goals would not be affected if one member of the GRC left, Mr Chan added.
