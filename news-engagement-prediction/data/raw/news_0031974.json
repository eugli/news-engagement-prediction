Credit Randy Pench/The Sacramento Bee, via Associated Press The authorities in California raced to evacuate thousands of people from a region in the northern part of the state on Sunday night before the possible failure of an emergency spillway at the Oroville Dam. Despite concerns of an imminent failure earlier in the evening, Sheriff Kory Honea of Butte County said at an evening news conference that the situation appeared to be improving, though he urged residents to continue evacuating the area in and around Oroville, a city of about 16,000 people. “The erosion that caused all of this concern was not advancing as rapidly they thought — that’s a very good thing,” he said, referring to expert assessments. State officials have said the 770-foot dam, built into a canyon roughly 70 miles north of Sacramento, is sound. Repeated rounds of rain pounded the area in recent weeks, causing Lake Oroville to rise rapidly. On Tuesday, a gaping hole opened up in the main spillway that is used to release extra water. Early Saturday, the adjacent emergency spillway was also put into play. It was the first time the emergency spillway was used since the dam was finished in 1968, officials said.
