Both the State and Homeland Security Departments said Saturday they were resuming normal practices concerning travelers from the affected countries. \nJudge William Canby, Jr. in Phoenix and Judge Michelle Friedland in San Francisco did not give a reason for their denial in a two-paragraph ruling. \nHowever, they told the states of Washington and Minnesota, which had filed the original suit against Trump’s travel ban, to provide documents detailing their opposition to the government’s appeal by 11:59 pm Sunday (0759 GMT Monday). \nThe Department of Justice was given a deadline of 3 pm Monday to supply more documents supporting its position. adekunle ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T18:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T15:51:43.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
