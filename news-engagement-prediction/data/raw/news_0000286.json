It pairs well with her outsize persona onstage, where she welcomes accidental nudity and forces audience members to lick whipped cream off her body, join in lewd singalongs, or “motorboat” her, by placing their face between her breasts. The titles of her songs — and the names of her dresses — are largely unprintable. Her Comedy Central special was “Gynecological Wonder.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Ms. Everett’s outlandish, unapologetic aesthetic has made her a favorite of other boundary-pushing performers like Amy Schumer, who featured her in the film “Trainwreck” and aired a Joe’s Pub performance to close the first season finale of “Inside Amy Schumer.” “It’s just really satisfying,” Ms. Schumer said of Ms. Everett’s budding fame. “She’s my absolutely, bar none, favorite performer to see live. She’s such a star. There’s no other word.” Photo Ms. Everett and her dog, Poppy. Credit Nina Westervelt for The New York Times Ms. Everett is still getting used to praise like this, which pours from the mouths of celebrities including Patti LuPone and Sarah Jessica Parker. “Every once in a while, I’m like, ‘What world am I living in?’” she said, and admitted she is prone to being starstruck. At Sundance, she jokingly flirted with the actor Gael García Bernal. “I still can’t breathe,” Ms. Everett wrote in an email after the festival. “He glows.” Singing has always been a part of Ms. Everett’s life. As the daughter of a music teacher in Manhattan, Kan., she was steered to voice lessons (and away from computer classes), she recalled in a post-shopping interview at the apartment of her longtime costume designer, Larry Krone. The lessons paid off: She received a full choral scholarship to Arizona State University, then stayed in Arizona, where she was a karaoke maven and worked at the first P. F. Chang’s. She waited on athletes including Charles Barkley and Mark McGwire and made connections that brought her opportunities like singing the national anthem at baseball games — with no flourishes, she emphasized. “I’m a big believer that if you’re not Whitney Houston, you sing the notes on the page,” she said. In the mid-1990s, Ms. Everett said, she realized she didn’t want to spend her life as a karaoke singer, and packed up for New York. She hasn’t been back to Arizona since.

Ms. Everett starred as the mother in a children’s theater production of “Hansel and Gretel,” and casting calls fell flat. She worked at places like the Ellen’s Stardust Diner, famous for its singing waitstaff, and in off-hours built a small following as a karaoke singer with dramatic, bold renditions of go-tos like “You Oughta Know” and “Piece of My Heart.” A turning point came when a friend introduced her to the world of downtown performance. He took her to see the cabaret duo Kiki and Herb , and Ms. Everett became close with Murray Hill, the borscht belt-style comedian and host. Through karaoke and this network of performers, she landed gigs at Ars Nova and LaMaMa — and, of course, Joe’s Pub. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Over the past decade, Ms. Everett has developed the onstage persona that is familiar and beloved among her fans. Her bawdy comedy, paired with original songs — which, while hilarious and heartbreaking, run the gamut of emotions — now make for a surprisingly cathartic experience. “It’s a kind of shock theater,” Ms. LuPone said. “You’re exposing yourself, and it’s a release. It’s a revival. Those evangelical preachers have nothing on Bridget.” Photo From left, Toni Collette, Molly Shannon, Katie Aselton and Ms. Everett in the film “Fun Mom Dinner.” Credit Robb Rosenfeld/Voltage Pictures Murray Hill compared Ms. Everett to “Rocky.” “Her shows are a prizefight,” he said. “She’s fighting against what she is supposed to be — the norm, the box that women are put in. She comes out swinging. We root for her all night.” Catharsis, Ms. Everett said, is at least what she was trying to experience for herself. “I think in my personal life I wasn’t finding much happiness,” she said. When she performed at Joe’s Pub only once a month in between restaurant shifts, she added, “these shows were the only chance to feel these emotions.” But her career progressed with a slow, steady burn. In 2013, she received a New York Voices grant from Joe’s Pub, which led to her 2014 show “Rock Bottom,” written with Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, of “Hairspray” fame. Both songwriters said they did little more than polish the songs Ms. Everett had written. “She has great ear for hooks, and she’s a beautiful lyricist,” Mr. Shaiman said. Mr. Wittman added: “There was a lot under the motorboating and bikinis that she was willing to share. We just tried to bring more of that out.” Writing the show’s stunning finale, “I’ll Take You Home,” for example, started with a melody line and lyrics by Ms. Everett. The final result, which was fleshed out with Mr. Shaiman and Mr. Wittman, is a dynamic progression from a quiet, delicate beginning to a rousing, belted ending that often inspires standing ovations.

Credit Nina Westervelt for The New York Times “Rock Bottom” was the final push for quitting what Ms. Everett likes to call her “slave job” at the restaurant, which she kept for health insurance. When the manager emailed to ask when she was coming back, Ms. Everett sent a triumphant reply: “I’m not coming back.” Then she went to a performance of “Rock Bottom.” “I told everybody, and I was crying, and they were crying,” she said. “The audience has been with me through everything. It was pretty emotional.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story “Rock Bottom” ended up selling out, and it occasionally returns to Joe’s Pub for brief runs. One of its newest regulars is Poppy, the dog she adopted in 2015 and a social media celebrity in her own right. “Since I got her,” Ms. Everett said, “it’s like my songwriting has changed. My life has changed.” She added that, since she has no training as an actor, she thought of Poppy while filming a sad scene in a movie recently. It worked; there were tears. In fact, the bottle of Rombauer Ms. Everett bought at the wine store was for Poppy’s sitter. After all, she doesn’t buy only one bottle at a time. “When I was waiting tables, it was whatever they had for $10 to $15 from Napa,” Ms. Everett said while perusing labels. “But now I’ll order a case of Rombauer. I’ve worked hard. I deserve it.” A version of this article appears in print on February 5, 2017, on Page AR20 of the New York edition with the headline: She Picks the Wine. Then Spits It at You.
