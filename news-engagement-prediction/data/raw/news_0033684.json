The busty star's bra was visible through her semi sheer top which she teamed with a padded jacket - worn off the shoulder - and full-length satin boots. Her sleek raven tresses cascaded straight over her shoulders from a middle parting and she sported winged eyeshadow and glossy pink lipstick. Ready to party: She completed the look with a pair of black stiletto-heeled ankle boots as she stepped out solo without hubby Kanye She touched down in New York on Monday after jetting in from Los Angeles to support her husband during NY Fashion Week. The reality star was spotted arriving at the couple's apartment building wearing a full-length, multi-colored fur coat. She kept her head down and covered her eyes with sunglasses despite the dark night. In town: Kim arrived in the Big Apple on Monday night and was wearing the same fur coat. She also had on Yeezy sneakers Luxury travel: The 36-year-old posted this pic of herself on board the private jet headed to New York She sported her long black wig and was dressed in a white tank top and drawstring sweatpants under her fur. Kim completed her show of support for Kanye by also donning a pair of Yeezy sneakers. But shortly after arriving, Kim did a quick change and headed out on the town again. Working: Kanye was seen leaving his apartment Monday amid concerns that the pressure of his fashion show might be too much for him after his mental health breakdown in November Kim left the apartment glammed up in an all-back ensemble and in full war-paint mode. She paired a buttoned-up lightweight top with shiny pants and her trademark baggy padded jacket draped down over her arms to hide her derriere. The siren completed the look with a pair of black stiletto-heeled ankle boots. But Kim was still solo as she stepped out without hubby Kanye. However, it's claimed the mother-of-two is more than a little anxious about whether or not her rapper husband, 39, is going to be able to handle the pressure of debuting his Yeezy season 5 collection on Wednesday following his highly-publicized 'psychotic breakdown' in November. Family matters: While his extended Kardashian-Jenner family are expected to be front row to support him Wednesday, his Yeezy show last year, pictured, got a lukewarm reception A source close to the family revealed to People that Kim and Kanye 'spent the weekend apart so Kanye could focus on the show.' The source also said that Kim is trying to be as supportive as possible because this kind of stress 'has been very bad for him in the past.' They continued, 'There is definitely some concern that the show will be too much stress for him. He gets so involved and itâ€™s hard for him to not get obsessed.' Further complicating things is the Bound 2 artist's still fragile health. On Sunday at the Grammys, Kanye's close friend Malik Yusef revealed new details about the 39-year-old rapper's condition, saying that his 'memory is coming back.' Before this, the star's memory issues were not public knowledge. Supportive wife: Kim played the doting spouse at Kanye's Yeezy season 4 show last September which was poorly received by the fashion world and garnered mediocre reviews Malik also told Popsugar that Kanye is 'healing' and 'going through processes.' Kanye himself skipped the Grammy Awards to focus on preparing for his fashion show that's taking place during New York Fashion Week. Kris Jenner has said that all the Kardashian-Jenner extended clan will be at the Yeezy season 5 event to support Kanye, just as they were last year. However, there's reason for the reality stars to be concerned about how the Life Of Pablo artist will deal with the pressure. Last year, a 'disastrous' Yeezy season 4 presentation ended with several models fainting in late summer heat and the collection itself garnered mediocre reviews from the fashion world. Some have pointed out that the stress from the show, coupled with Kim's terrifying robbery in Paris in late September, were all contributing factors to Kanye's November 10th breakdown and subsequent hospitalization.
