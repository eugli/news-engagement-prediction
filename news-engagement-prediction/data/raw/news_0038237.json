By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Monday, February 13, 2017 - 12:27 0 Follow @ZeeNewsSports \nNew Delhi: Former Indian opener Virender Sehwag paid rich tributes to two Indian soldiers killed in an over-night gun-battle in South Kashmir’s Kulgam district on Sunday. \nSehwag took to Twitter to write, \"Naman to army jawans Bhandoriya Gopal Singh & Raghuveer Singh who attained martyrdom today in Kulgam. Om Shanti.\" Naman to army jawans Bhandoriya Gopal Singh & Raghuveer Singh who attained martyrdom today in Kulgam. Om Shanti . pic.twitter.com/CCRCEt5lON \n— Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) February 12, 2017 \nWhile most of his fans extended their tributes along with Viru, one of them tried to mock at it. \nThe cricketer-turned-commentator is not one to hold his words and he did exactly the same after a Kashmiri native tried to make fun of the martyrdom of two Indian soldiers. \nIn a tweet which he later deleted, Muhammad Umair wrote, \"@adgpi @virendersehwag Two dogs in hell...Loving that...\" \nFully aware of the fact that there was no point in using foul langugae for such trollers, Viru replied, \"No word in dictionary to describe beings like you. Get well soon. Prayers !\" No word in dictionary to describe beings like you. Get well soon. Prayers ! https://t.co/JKGPSPY785 \n— Virender Sehwag (@virendersehwag) February 12, 2017 \nTwo Indian soldiers - Bhandoriya Gopal Singh and Raghuveer Singh were killed in an over-night gun battle in South Kashmir’s Kulgam district on Sunday.
