As I suspected, there are no real bars there, just bars that are really restaurants.\nAt 7 Central Public House, the pear and prosciutto salad is a fine choice. I was tempted to order the avocado fries but had visions of some crazed townie grabbing one and gouging my eyes out with it.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email. Seventy-two years ago, Larry Kirby was a young Marine storming the sandstone on Iwo Jima. Now he negotiates the mean streets of Manchester-by-the-Sea.\nView Story Another thing that makes Manchester-by-the-Sea famous? Its singing sand. Singing Beach in Manchester-by-the-Sea is famous for the sound its sand makes when you walk on it.\n“We don’t have any brawls because we have no place to brawl,” Kirby, 92 and a genuine American hero, was saying.\nYears ago, there was a great dive in the middle of town called Al’s Cafe. But Al’s is gone, as are most of the townies.\nAdvertisement\n“There are very few townies left, and they are really old because their kids and grandkids live elsewhere and cannot afford to buy in Manchester,” Kirby said.\nPaul Murphy, assistant principal at Manchester Essex Regional High School, said writer-director Kenneth Lonergan and his crew spent four days at the school filming scenes that amount to about 35 seconds in the movie.\nHe said Lonergan and his crew were exceedingly nice and pumped a lot of money into the local economy, but he said locals all over Cape Ann who’ve seen the film recognize that it’s more about Gloucester than Manchester-by-the-Sea.\nAs a title, “Manchester by the Sea” is simply more lyrical than “Gloucester.”\nIn fact, that bar brawl in the movie was filmed not at one of the high-end establishments in Manchester-by-the-Sea but at Pratty’s, a wonderful dive in Gloucester.\nWhen I walked into Pratty’s the other day, the bartender, the great Bobby Turvey, said they were out of avocado fries. But that’s because they’ve never served avocado fries.\nA pint of PBR will set you back $2.50, and while the place is packed with friendly locals and not a few fishermen, it is true that, while exceedingly rare, a closed fist and a profane word have been known to fly around Pratty’s.\nBobby Turvey said they shut the bar down for a day for filming. He said the Hollywood crowd couldn’t have been nicer.\nNick Pratt, who manages the place for his dad, Jimmy, said the filmmakers were drawn to Pratty’s authentic feel and atmosphere. The old-fashioned wood-paneled walls and kitschy decor don’t exactly scream Manchester-by-the-Sea.\n“If you watch the movie, there’s a lot more of Gloucester in it than Manchester-by-the-Sea,” Pratt said. “I guess they could have called it ‘Gloucester-by-the-Harbor,’ but I don’t know if that works at the box office.”\nThere’s a poster from “Deadliest Catch” displayed prominently above the bar, a souvenir from when the cable TV series followed a Gloucester fishing crew and filmed at Pratty’s. But nothing from “Manchester by the Sea” yet.\nSome of Pratty’s patrons acknowledge they have yet to see the film, though all say they want to. More impressive, however, was how many of the regulars were aware that this week marks the 72nd anniversary of the Battle of Iwo Jima, and that Larry Kirby, the old Marine who fought and survived, lives right down Route 127 in the neighboring town they all call Manchester.\nTurns out Pratty’s full name is Pratty’s C.A.V., for Cape Ann Veterans.\nSay what you want about Pratty’s. They don’t have avocado fries on the menu, but they know their history and have their priorities in order.\nKevin Cullen is a Globe columnist.
