I'm sorry you clicked on this story, and I interrupted your day. \nStupid, right? In a new YouTube video , vlogger Kristina Kuzmic explains why it is high time we moms stop apologizing for really dumb, unnecessary things. First, she admits she says \"sorry\" for far too much. It's kind of like word vomit; the words just come out of her mouth. \n\"I'm so sorry my house is a mess.\" \n\"Sorry I look so tired.\" \nOr my personal favorite: \"Sorry, can I ask you a question?\" I do this all the time! Why? I'm actually not sorry at all! And now that Kuzmic is pointing out the ridiculousness of apologies for no reason, I too feel resolved to stop the insanity. \nOf course, there are situations where apologies are warranted. That time my toddler cut in front of someone in the airport and basically caused them to trip, I was truly sorry. Although, she is 3 years old, and most kids in this age group are kind of notorious for not looking where they are going or having any situational awareness whatsoever. So, my apology wasn't as profuse as it would have been had it been me that accidentally tripped that person.

We already have enough to feel bad about, without these silly excuses! \n\"I'm a mother. Feeling bad is part of my job description,\" the vlogger quips. But, pretty much. \nApologizing for everything also sends a bad message to our kids, especially if we're apologizing about them. Like saying, \"Sorry, she never stops talking.\" Apologizing for who our kids are is indeed truly icky! \nSo why do we do it? Perhaps we're just being polite. Or we want others to like us. But Kuzmic asserts, \"The truth is, saying 'sorry' just makes us look insecure and defensive.\" And no one likes someone who is insecure and defensive. Want the latest parenting news?
