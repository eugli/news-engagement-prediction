Trump protest in Leeds Credit: PA \nEarlier on Tuesday, the court said it would likely rule this week but would not issue a same-day ruling. \nThe matter is likely to go to the US Supreme Court. \nTravellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen were banned from entering the US for 90 days on 27 January. \nAll refugees were also banned for 120 days, with the exception of refugees from Syria, whom he would ban indefinitely. \nTrump, who took office on 20 January, has defended the measure - which sparked worldwide protests - as necessary for national security. \nA federal judge in Seattle suspended the order on Friday and many travellers who had been waylaid by the ban quickly moved to travel to the United States while it was in limbo.
