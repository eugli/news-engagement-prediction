Stuff.co.nz \nJoost van der Westhuizen sends Lomu crashing to the ground. \nLomu, the Kiwi man mountain, had dominated the tournament right up to the dramatic final with his try-scoring deeds. \nREAD MORE: * Former Springboks captain has motor-neuron disease \nAnd he was threatening to spoil the party for the hosts, the newly democratic and post-apartheid South Africa. In the final at Johannesburg's Ellis Park, several times Lomu broke away and thundered towards the tryline, Springboks bouncing off him. Until Van der Westhuizen stood in his path. Three times the South Africa scrum half pulled off monumental tackles to send Lomu crashing to the ground. REUTERS \nJoost van der westhuizen cuts down a rampaging Jonah Lomu during the dramatic 1995 World Cup final in South Africa. \nOne of them in particular will be remembered as long as rugby is played. \n\"I was the lucky one,\" Van der Westhuizen joked about it years later. \"I think he fell over me.\" \nThat was the modest side of Van der Westhuizen, the ultimate competitor, as he reflected on a 15-12 result secured in extra time. \nBut helping keep Lomu try-less in the final – a trait that continued through the big wing's career against the Boks – helped the Boks win their first World Cup and emphasise their glaring absence from the first two tournaments on political grounds. \nTouchingly, Van der Westhuizen won over Lomu as their careers blossomed on the back of that tournament. \nTheir friendship lasted right up till Lomu's untimely death in late 2015. \nLike Van der Westhuizen, Lomu battled a life-threatening illness. \nNo one expected the Springbok to outlast the All Black but that's the way it played out. \nLomu's death hit Van der Westhuizen hard. \"Difficult to write with eyes full of tears on my eye tracker. Thank you for EVERYTHING Jonah. RIP my dear friend!\" he tweeted at the time. \nAm emotional Lomu had visited Van der Westhuizen in the buildup to the 2015 World Cup, paying tribute to the player and the Springboks as part of a documentary he was filming \nThere was a mix of joy and tears as they met up. \n\"Promise me you'll keep fighting, because I'll keep praying for you,\" Lomu pleaded to Van der Westhuizen. \n\"Take care, my friend,\" he added as he was about to depart. Lomu hesitated, bent down and kissed the South African, adding \"love you\" with tears in his eyes. \nNow they are both gone within 15 months of each other, Lomu taken at 40 and Van der Westhuizen at 45. \nSouth Africans were quick to acknowledge the game and grace of Lomu when he suddenly departed. \nNew Zealanders have been just as quick to acknowledge the fighting qualities that set Van der Westhuizen apart, on and off the field. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T02:47:55.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
