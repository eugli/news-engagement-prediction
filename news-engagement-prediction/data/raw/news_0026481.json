Lee/The Dallas Morning News) By Joey Hayden , Staff Writer Contact Joey Hayden on Twitter: @_joeyhayden \nTony Romo is by far the biggest question mark heading into the Dallas Cowboys' offseason. \nWith the emergence of rookie sensation Dak Prescott, the chances of Tony Romo ever taking a snap again under center for the Cowboys have become very clouded ... at least to most people. \nWWE Superstar The Miz recently joined ESPN's SportsNation when the topic of the starting quarterback position of the Cowboys arose. \nThe Miz had three simple words for Jerry Jones and Co. \n\"Start Tony Romo.\" \nNot the most popular opinion considering Prescott, the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year, arguably just led the most productive NFL season ever by a first-year quarterback, but The Miz did not back down. Unlike his Cleveland Browns, WWE's The Miz thinks the Cowboys have something 'champions are made of' \n\"And I know everyone's laughing at me and saying why would you start him? But Dak Prescott had an amazing line. He had a ton of weapons,\" he continued. \"Cody Kessler could have ran that offense and took them to where Dak Prescott did.\" \nThis isn't the first time The Miz has tried to shine the light of the Cowboys' success on players other than Prescott. In December, he credited the Dallas offensive line of providing the path to success for both Prescott and fellow rookie Ezekiel Elliott. \nAnd don't be too quick to dismiss his opinion. Fans would be hard-pressed to find anyone in the WWE locker room more into the NFL and fantasy football. So, The Miz at least has a (somewhat) credible opinion. An opinion which is still all aboard the Romo bandwagon. \n\"Tony Romo has the fourth-highest passer rating in NFL history ... Romo is a Super Bowl-caliber quarterback,\" he said. \"Do you want to make it to the Super Bowl? Do you want the Cowboys to go to the Super Bowl? Then you play Tony Romo.\" \nSee a clip of The Miz on SportsNation here . This Topic is Missing Your Voice.
