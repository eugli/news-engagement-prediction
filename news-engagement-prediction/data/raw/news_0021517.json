The separate campaign by the Syrian army has raised the risk of a clash with the Turkish military.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organization that reports on the war, said the Turkish forces and their Free Syrian Army rebel allies had captured a hill on the western periphery of the city.\n\"We don't know if Daesh (Islamic State) will be able to recover it, or if it is in a state of collapse,\" Observatory Director Rami Abdulrahman said. The rebel official said Turkish reinforcements had been sent to the area a week ago.\n(Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk in Istanbul/Tom Perry in Beirut; Writing by Tom Perry; Editing by Larry King)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T11:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T10:39:42.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
