Emperor Akihito hints at desire to abdicate \nThe last time an emperor abdicated was in 1817 and current law does not allow it. \nThe Japanese government is considering steps that would allow Akihito to abdicate and for Naruhito to ascend the throne on 1 January 2019. The government could submit a special abdication law to parliament within the coming months. \nNaruhito told reporters he was “profoundly moved” when Akihito suggested he would like to step down. \n“I accept the emperor’s thinking with sincerity and will bear it in mind all the time as I carry out my duties,” Naruhito said.

Naruhito is followed in the succession by his brother, Prince Akishino, and Akishino’s 10-year-old son, Hisahito. \nPhotos of the family released to commemorate Naruhito’s birthday show him sitting formally with Masako and Aiko, who appears to be very thin.
