There is a lot of innovation that we can bring to the table whereby our companies are safe and can grow profitably. Edited excerpts: \n\nET Now: Trump’s H1-B visa move has become a very big issue for the Indian infotech industry. Nasscom and the IT CEO are going to US for dialogue with US administration on this. If it goes through the US congress, what will be the effect on the IT industry? \nNarayana Murthy: Nasscom and the IT CEOs who are going to US to talk with the Trump administration should use their influence to prevent the H 1-B visa order from going through. \nBut in case, it does go through, let us look at what happens. There are several possibilities. First of all, the profitability of the Indian software companies is likely to go down. It varies from company to company because the entire industry will be impacted. As far as the market capitalisation of these companies are concerned, it should not make too much of a difference because everybody is sailing in the same sea. \n\nThere is a second possibility and that is because the Indian software industry is playing such a prominent role in this information infrastructure of US corporations, they will be in a position to sit down with their customers in the US and renegotiate the prices. Thereby their profitability will not be impacted as much as we think it would. Obviously, they will have to leave some money on the table for the customer and at the same time they have to lose some profitability. \n\nThere is a third possibility and that is the Indian software industry, the Indian software companies would do well to innovate further like we did at Infosys in 2013 and we came out with what is called visa independent global delivery model wherein we reduced the total effort onsite in a project from about 30% on an average to just 10%. We said this 10% will be delivered by local hires. We conducted several pilots and almost all the pilots were pretty successful. Therefore, the entire industry may move towards visa independent global delivery model. Just as in the ‘90s Infosys moved to the global delivery model, the entire industry followed it. \n\nTherefore, I personally feel that there is no need for us to be unduly concerned about it. There is no need for us to go into a panic mode. Knowing the smartness of the Indian software industry, I believe it will come out with a solution wherein things will be back to perhaps a new normal. \n\nET Now: You have been saying for a long time now that we cannot build an industry based on visas. It is something that you reiterated even a couple of days back. But considering we cannot become independent all of a sudden, the dependence on H-1B, L1 visas is still high though it has been coming down.. How do you suggest IT companies move forward in the near term? \nNarayana Murthy: Even if the US Congress were to decide and the senate were to bless it or if the president were to issue an executive order, it is very likely that this order will be over the new H-1B visas that will be issued. It may not be on a retrospective basis. Number two, just now I spoke about the visa independent global delivery model where we can reduce the total effort by as much as 200%, in other words from 30% of the total product effort to 10% which means using the same talent we should be able to do three times the total revenue for these companies. And third, I think the local hiring will obviously have to be stepped up because at the end of the day, the local talent will be much better in selling our services in the market to their corporations. \n\nThe local people will be able to interact with our customers much better because they speak English as mother tongue. They understand the lingo, their local jargons, etc. Overall, we will convert what appears to be a huge problem at this point of time to a great opportunity for the Indian software industry to grow. \n\nET Now: We have heard this protectionist noises from US time and again but is there an imminent fear that probably this can spread to other geographies as well? Should Indian IT industry really be looking at the entire protectionist approach by politicians given the fact that be it US, UK everybody is trying to protect their home businesses? \nNarayana Murthy: The reality is that politicians in any country have the responsibility to ensure that the unemployment levels in their country is as low as possible. Therefore, we cannot blame them. Let us remember what India itself did a few years ago when UPA government was in power. At that time, when Chinese companies were charged with building power plants in India and they wanted to bring Chinese labour because there are very stiff completion targets, the Government of India said that you must give a minimum wage of $25,000 a year for construction workers for power plant builders. That was probably six or seven times the salary that we would pay such a person in India. \n\nSo it is nothing new to US alone. We have done it ourselves and we all realised that it was done for a good reason by our politicians. We cannot blame them. Therefore, I would not go into a tizzy on this issue. I would accept it as reality and it is our responsibility to come out with a mechanism whereby we reduce our dependence on visas. \n\nET Now: Nasscom is going to take a delegation of Indian IT CEOs to the US to negotiate with the Trump administration. But do we really have enough negotiating power to move an administration in the US to get a favourable response? \nNarayana Murthy: I do not know whether I would like to use the word negotiation. The right phrase would be our competence, our good work ethic, our desire to put customer first -- these are the hallmarks of the Indian software professional. Therefore, what Nasscom will do and the CEOs will do is to enlighten the members of the Congress and the senators and others that are in power about the extraordinary advantages of working with Indian companies. They will also enlighten those people on how the Indian companies have added tremendous value to making the American companies much more competitive and perhaps they will also talk about the taxes that the Indian companies have paid and the jobs that the Indian companies have created not just in the IT sector alone but in secondary sectors also, That is what I would say. \n\nET Now: One more possibility you mentioned. People say this is perhaps an opportunity for Indian companies to ensure that employees move up the value chain in terms of the work they are doing onsite. Do you think that could be another outcome should this order come through? \nNR Narayana Murthy: No. It is not the question of doing better value addition. That has always been the focus of Indian software companies. The issue is simply this – no management and no board of a company should depend so much on the policies of any government, that is the fundamental principle of risk identification and risk mitigation because this a huge risk, you have no control over governments. \n\nLet me give you a very simple example. In the early eighties, the Government of India made it so difficult for us to import computers. There were no telephone lines. There were no communication lines. What did we do? At that time, because the US government was so friendly, we did the entire project onsite. In fact, all my colleagues, Nandan, Chris, Shibu, Raghavan, everybody was in the US. I was the only person in India. \n\nTherefore, we cannot fight any government, let us remember, whether it is US Government, UK Government, Indian Government, etc. No business can fight any government. We will have to work within the constraints of the government and there is a lot of innovation that we can bring to the table whereby our companies are safe, our companies can grow well, again grow profitably and we can make the customers winners so that is what we should be doing. \n\nET Now: Earlier you were telling also that Nasscom and CEOs should try to tell the US administration about our competence and other things. Till now we were not doing it? \nNarayana Murthy: No we were doing it, definitely we were doing it but these go to the backburners if it is not a burning issue. Therefore, we will have to bring it back to the frontburner. We will have to refresh their memories and we will have to ensure that they remember the extraordinary contribution of the industry when they are discussing those decisions. \n\nET Now: Do you believe Indians boards have done enough to mitigate this risk so far because this is not a narrative that has been built in the last three months, it is happening over the last two-three years, even during Obama’s administration? Do you think boards have failed in their duty in that sense? \nNarayana Murthy: Well I started this in 2013, the visa independent global delivery model. You will have to ask the Infosys board. Similarly you will have to ask other boards where these initiatives are because we completed about seven or eight pilots before I left the company and I am sure they would have taken it forward and you can ask the senior management of Infosys as well board of Infosys how those initiatives are going. I am not in a position to answer that.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T12:07:33.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
