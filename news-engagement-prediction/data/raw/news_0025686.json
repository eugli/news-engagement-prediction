Avocado is full of natural oils that will moisturise skin, and banana is rich in potassium to make skin supple. 'The bananas actually exfoliate and dissolve the [dry] skin,' she explained - and even recommended using the skin from the banana to rub on corns. METHOD 1. Mash a banana and an avocado together into a bowl. 2. Spoon the mixture into a clean sock. 3. Place the sock on your bare feet for 20 minutes before rinsing off the mixture. MINT IMPERIALS LIP SCRUB Crush up sugar or mints and mix with lip balm, like Vaseline, and then rub on to your lips which will then melt away For dry lips Deborah suggest using some lip balm and crushed up mint imperials or sugar to create a cheap scrub. METHOD 1. Scoop a chunk of lip balm from an existing pot and place on the back of your hand. 2. Add crushed up mint imperials or sugar to your hand. 3. Using your finger rub the mixture on to your lips. 4. No need to rub off as it dissolves, leaving behind soft - and minty fresh - lips. COFFEE UNDER-EYE TREATMENT Apply the undereye mixture of coffee using the back of a cold spoon and it will help to alleviate dark circles The trick to getting rid of tired eyes, Deborah says, is coffee and your eye cream. Not only is coffee an anti-inflammatory, it's also rich in anti-oxidants. METHOD 1. Add a spoonful of coffee granules to your eye cream. 2. Using the back of a cold spoon press the mixture on to your dark circles. 3. Rinse off.
