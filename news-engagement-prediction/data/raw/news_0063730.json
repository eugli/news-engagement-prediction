Directed by Harish Shankar and produced by Dil Raju, the film revolves around a Brahmin boy’s life.\n “There are no jokes or derogatory comments on Brahmins in the film. Director Harish Shankar, who is a Brahmin himself, is very proud of his community,” says a source from the unit.\nIn the past, a few filmmakers targeted Brahmins in their films and faced flack. Since then, the community has kept a keen eye on such films. “DJ is the answer to those who mock the community,” added the source.\nThe source also revealed that Allu Arjun has turned vegetarian for this role. “For the last six months, Allu hasn’t eaten meat. He is taking the role seriously,” said the source.\n“After the first look of DJ was released, I got calls from several people who were concerned about the community’s image. So I spoke to the director and he assured me that there are no comments against the community,” says Dronamraju Ravi Kumar, convener of the All India Brahmin Federation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:25:13.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
