But already, the soap are working on the next special week that will play out later this year – and it’s sounding intriguing. \nTeasing that the week of drama would be every bit as big and unique as the last one, boss Iain MacLeod was quick to point out that it will be less stunt focused. However, while he didn’t hint at the characters or events involved, he did drop a few teasers when we caught up with him at a recent event. \nHe shared: ‘Looking to later in the year, one of the big things we’re currently working on is something that will be a bit like what we did last year with the big car crash where everything was all jumbled up and the storytelling was a bit crazy. This won’t be as stunt driven but it will be equally as quirky and interesting and probably non-linear.’ \nLet’s just hope that the lives of all of our favourite characters are safe this time. With the death of Ashley Thomas set to take place over spring, we’re not sure we can handle even more heartbreak. \nBut with rumours strongly suggesting that Emma Barton will be involved again, our hopes for a fatality free week aren’t high… All the press event gossip! \nIn case you missed any, here are links to all of the articles from the Emmerdale press event. \nFirst details of Chas’ exit revealed ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:40:20.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
