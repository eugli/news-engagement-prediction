(Supplied) Upper Hunter temperatures take a toll \nMore than 700 flying foxes also died in the Upper Hunter town of Singleton due to the extreme heat. \nThe majority of the dead bats were found in Burdekin Park, which has been home to a large flying fox population. \nSingleton experienced temperatures of 47 degrees over the weekend. \nJalla Presland, from Wildlife Aid in the Upper Hunter, said it was the worst heat stress-related deaths they had seen in the colony in more than 10 years. \n\"We are currently sitting at just under 700 and that's without having collected the ones from around the town,\" she said. \n\"Unfortunately we encounter it in much smaller numbers most summers. \n\"The worst one that we have encountered is this one since 2004.\" Warning about public health risk \nNorth Coast Area Health Service spokesman Greg Bell warned people not to touch bats unless they were fully vaccinated against lyssavirus and trained to handle bats. \n\"Australian bats can carry the lyssavirus and that's very serious,\" he said. \n\"We've had three human cases of lyssavirus in Australia, in Queensland, and all three people died.\" \nMr Bell said if anyone was bitten or scratched by a bat they must seek medical treatment. \n\"Don't panic. Wash the site with good quality soap and water, apply a good quality disinfectant and then call your GP or present to the nearest emergency department,\" he said. \n\"There is no risk from the odour, faeces or urine.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T13:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T09:01:56.329+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
