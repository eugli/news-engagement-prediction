AP Photo / David Parody \nRussian oligarch Andrey Melnichenko's £360 million superyacht has been impounded by the Gibraltar Port Authority over claims he owes the shipbuilder money. \nGerman boatmakers, Norbiskrug, are seeking an additional £13.3 million (£16.5 million) for the vessel from the billionaire, according to reports. \nThe world's largest sailing yacht, it is described by Norbiskrug as \"one of the greatest PYC [Passenger Yacht Code] superyachts in the world in terms of design and technology.\" \nSailing Yacht A boasts three masts taller than London's Big Ben clock tower and is almost the length of three Olympic swimming pools. \nGibraltar Admiralty Marshal, Liam Yeats, told the BBC : \"The vessel is under arrest and is currently at anchor in British Gibraltar Territorial Waters.\" \nMelnichenko is confident \"technical problem\" can be resolved.
