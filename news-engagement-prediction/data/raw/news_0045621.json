Dozier DFP) 22 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLAKELAND, Fla. — Miguel Cabrera’s golf cart arrived in Tiger Town on Sunday. \nIt is orange, with chrome rims, leather seats and oftentimes during the early stages of spring training, you can find Cabrera cruising with his teammates around the Joker Marchant Stadium complex. \nParked outside the Detroit Tigers’ clubhouse, it was the latest reminder that the big man had arrived for this, the 15th spring of his future Hall of Fame career. \nA day earlier, signs could be seen all over. \nThe wide eyes of younger Tigers, like right-handed reliever William Cuevas, who was sharing a clubhouse with Cabrera for the first time. The banter on the backfields during infield practice — at one point, Cabrera hopped on the mound and delivered a strike, saying to the pitching staff, “Just in case.” The batting practice balls he hit, which sailed into a construction zone. \nRelated: Omar Infante hoping for chance to play centerfield for Detroit Tigers \nAfter the team’s first full-squad workout, Cabrera held court in front of his locker, touching on a number of topics, from longtime team owner Mike Ilitch to the unrest in Venezuela to this year’s Tigers, which he will try to lead back to the postseason. \n“We’ve got a chance to play one more year together,” he said. “We know what we’ve got here. We know we didn’t go to the playoffs the last two years, but I think if we stay together, if we stay healthy, we’ve got a chance to compete every day.”’ \nCabrera is well aware of the impending free agents on the team, like rightfielder J.D. Martinez and perhaps second baseman Ian Kinsler. He knows their talented core is not getting any younger. \n“I think it’s like, ‘Let’s make one more shot,’” he said. “We have a chance to give it one more shot. We’ll see what happens.” Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
