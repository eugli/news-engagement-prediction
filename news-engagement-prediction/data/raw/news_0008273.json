In hindsight, she says, the performance should have been canceled and rescheduled. \nHill says the promoter used social media to notify fans that the show would start late. But the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported that many fans left and demanded refunds. \nHill says she hopes to schedule another Pittsburgh performance for those fans later this month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T10:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T06:45:35.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
