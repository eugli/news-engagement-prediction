He, however, added that his brother was served the summons on February 2, asking Naik to appear before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on February 9, and maintained that it could not be construed as proper service (of summons). \n\nNaik has also requested the ED to wait for the order of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) tribunal before asking him any questions about his now-banned NGO IRF as the ban is being contested. \n\nIRF was banned for five years by the government last year under the UAPA for its alleged terror activities. \n\nNaik also claimed that he faces an extremely hostile atmosphere in India and under these circumstances, conducting a fair probe against him would be impossible. \n\nHe also sought a few months' time to appear before the ED in person. \n\nLast week, the ED had arrested Aamir Gazdar, a close aide of Naik, in connection with the money laundering case. \n\nThe central probe agency had registered a criminal case against Naik and others in December, 2016 after taking cognizance of an NIA complaint under the UAPA. \n\nThe ED is looking into the charges of illegal funds laundered by the accused and the subsequent proceeds of crime thus generated. \n\nNaik, 51, is said to be staying in Saudi Arabia to evade arrest after some perpetrators of the Dhaka terror strike last year claimed that they were inspired by him. \n\nHe, along with unnamed IRF officials, has been booked under section 153A, IPC (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), besides various UAPA sections.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:54:39.956+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
