The girls will also taught how to use and dispose sanitary napkins,\" she said. \n\"If need be, mothers of these girls will also be counselled to ensure that their orthodox beliefs about menstruation are changed,\" she added. \nSo far these lessons have been conducted in slums in Kondli, Laxmi Nagar, Krishna Nagar, Patparganj, Trilopkpuri, Madanpur Khadar, Wazirpur and Shakur Basti. \nUnfortunately, even today women in India are perceived as 'unclean' or 'impure' during menstruation, making them an outcast in the society. \n(With PTI inputs) First Published: Thursday, February 23, 2017 - 16:43 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T07:28:40.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
