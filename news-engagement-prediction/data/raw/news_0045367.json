Ing believes that Maui’s “agricultural future must be centered around leasing small plots to small, innovative farmers and allowing shared equipment though co-owned ag parks. Let’s democratize the plantation. We have an opportunity to set an example of self-sustainability for the world.” \nPublic comment concerning what many in Maui view as A&B’s massive water theft will be heard on Wednesday, February 22 from 5 to 7 p.m. (in the Maui Electric Company Meeting Room in Kahului ) and Thursday, February 23 from 5 to 7 p.m. in the Hai’ku Park and Community Center . \nThe public will be commenting on this environmental impact statement preparation notice (”EISPN”) that will be reviewed by the state Department of Land and Natural Resources in a few months. The EISPN was commissioned by A&B as it attempts to secure a 30-year extension for about 120 million gallons of water per day for the East Maui EMI Aqueduct System. Incredibly, a s Maui’s Sierra Club has reported, without an extension of this huge water giveaway, “documents submitted by A&B indicate there are 132 million gallons per day available from their existing private sources.” \nFor the corporate welfare price of just $160,000 per year, the EMI System had supplied an average of 165 million gallons of water per day to 33,000 acres of A&B owned sugar plantation land in Central Maui for decades. Now that the cane-burning, air-fouling, polluting sugar plantations have closed due to unprofitability, the water they use could instead restore stream flow, fish populations upstream, and diversified agriculture. Maui currently imports more than 90% of its food, while Hawaiian farmers of environmentally restorative organic, or indigenous food like tarot, are starved of water. \nThe aqueduct system and corporate water giveaway are rooted in century-old plantation-era water “contracts” imposed upon Hawaii by five immensely powerful American families (including Alexander and Baldwin), who funded a deadly militia to take power from the Native Hawaiian dynasty during the notorious “Bayonet Constitution” of 1887. \n“A&B takes half the water on Maui, for what this past decade has been less than 1% of the County’s economic activity,” Ing said, shortly before the important hearings. “ “This corporation exaggerated their value to our society, while in reality, it is slowing growth by gobbling up resources. This is what happens when you allow a single for-profit corporation to monopolize your water source.” \n“It’s not that A&B is an evil corporation run by evil people. But it’s an evil system that can only be undone by government. \nMaui is set to be an example of regenerative and sustainable agriculture,” Ing observes. “But we’re going to need some serious political disruption in order to do that.” ALSO ON HUFFPOST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T08:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:08:34.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
