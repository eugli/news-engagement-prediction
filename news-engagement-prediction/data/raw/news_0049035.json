Stevenson's Dylan Geick wraps up Oak Park-River Forest's Brian Holloway during their 160-pound match at the Class 3A state meet Friday in Champaign. (Brian O'Mahoney / Daily Southtown) Michael Garofola Pioneer Press \nThe Stevenson wrestling team arrived here last Thursday with plenty of hope for the days ahead at the Class 3A wrestling state meet. But as coach Shane Cook cautioned beforehand, some things just can't be controlled. \n\"You never know what's going to happen at this tournament, and when it does, it can tear you apart,\" Cook said after two of his four state qualifiers secured medals. \"Fortunately, we had a tremendous group competing this weekend, first-class guys all the way, and in the grand scheme of life, that's what's most important.\" \nDylan Geick knows firsthand about the culture of success at Stevenson. \nGeick, who finished fourth at 160 pounds a year after placing fourth at 152, has been the face of the Patriots' program for two seasons. After being home-schooled as a freshman, he spent his sophomore year at Vernon Hills, where he finished second in the North Suburban Prairie and the Class 2A Vernon Hills Regional at 145 pounds. The wrestler who beat him at both meets was Antioch's Pat Schoenfelder, who won this year's 2A title at 160 pounds. \nOnce Geick arrived at Stevenson as a junior, he knew something was different the moment he arrived in the Patriots' wrestling room. \n\"It's an amazing environment (Cook) has put together,\" Geick said. \"The motto for Stevenson wrestling is 'Always Together.' We live it, we share it. We're a family.\" \nGeick (42-3), who will wrestle at Columbia next season, transformed from a newcomer to a leader of that family. He said the Patriots do everything together, ranging from a high turnout at summer wrestling camps to getting 40 people together to go bowling. \n\"Then, there's that group you see up in the stands,\" Geick said while pointing to the remaining 70-some members of the wrestling program within the State Farm Center crowd. The Stevenson spectators all wore fluorescent yellow shirts, as has become a custom. \nAt state, Tommy Frezza, Eric Carter, Nikita Nepomnyashchiy and Geick knew their teammates were right with them — win or lose — at the start of each match. \n\"You wrestle for yourself at this time of the season, but it's always about the bond between teammates and your friends,\" Geick said. \"And Coach is behind all of it.\" \nNepomnyashchiy (21-4), who finished sixth at 170 pounds, will wrestle at Michigan next year. Carter (145 pounds, 38-10) will move on to Duke, and Frezza (113, 38-5) will return for his junior season. \n\"What those four have done — and, more specifically, the three seniors: Eric, Dylan and Nikita — has been incredible and not to be forgotten or overlooked,\" Cook said. \"But friendships are forever, and the commitment and dedication to the sport and each other is much more important, and something they will remember for a lifetime.\" \nCougars grapple well in 2A \nThe Vernon Hills wrestling season officially came to an end when 113-pound junior Jesse Goldufsky was eliminated from the Class 2A wrestlebacks on Saturday morning. \nCoach Jerry Miceli said he was proud of Goldufsky and his other state qualifier, 220-pound senior Collin Turley. \n\"Jesse had a terrific tournament in his first time here,\" Miceli said. \"Collin Turley, well, I can't tell you how proud I am of him. He went from nothing to something to become not only our leader in the room, but a guy who won a lot of matches for us.\" \nTurley finished 42-10 overall, and Goldufsky ended up 41-12 to become the eighth and ninth Vernon Hills wrestlers to win 40 matches in a season. \n\"Collin was a great story and an even greater kid, and he will be missed for sure,\" Miceli said. \nMichael Garofola is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press. \nTwitter @Pioneer_Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:23:39.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
