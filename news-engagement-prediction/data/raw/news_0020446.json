Both have been affected by the teachers' work-to-rule job action, but it was the cancellation of Emma's trip to Cambridge, Mass., to take part in the Harvard Model United Nations that led to the invoice, which was sent Tuesday.\nParents rally for teachers on 2-month anniversary of work-to-rule MacDougall had known since the Christmas holidays that the trip was off, but didn't learn until Tuesday morning that each family was losing about $40 of their trip deposit.\nSo she sent an invoice to the union asking for the $40 back, with an extra line declaring \"punitive loss — disappointment and loss of opportunity\" with a value of \"priceless.\"\nThe invoice also included the message: \"Shame on all of you!\"\n'Double standard' MacDougall sent an accompanying email, which she also addressed to local media, noting the model UN trip was cancelled but not teachers' travel for professional development .\n\"This double standard is not lost on parents or our children,\" she wrote.\nMacDougall told CBC News she felt it was important to hold the NSTU accountable.\n\"The lost opportunity and development for these young adults is significant,\" she said. \"Particularly for those ... who are graduating.
