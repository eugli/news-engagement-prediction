That marked the beginning of his unexpected protest. \nAfter sitting in meditation for more than 40 minutes, OPS told waiting journalists that he was practically usurped from his chief ministerial position. He insisted he was Jayalalithaa's choice for the chief ministerial position and that Sasikala and her supporters threatened and forced him to resign from the top post. \n\"I will withdraw my resignation, if people wish... I would fight to save the party and the goodwill of Jayalalithaa's legacy,\" he said. Tamil Nadu's all like, UP-shoopie. pic.twitter.com/FYl0XUovHb â€” Rohan Venkat (@RohanV) February 7, 2017 \nA lot has happened since OPS' surprise protest last night. \nWe bring you five top developments: \nSasikala expels Panneerselvam \nSoon after OPS declared his rebellion, AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala called for an emergency meeting at Poes Garden. After a three-hour long meet, she came out of her residence and announced to a wave of supporters and media persons that O Pannerselvam will be expelled from his post of AIADMK Treasurer. Now #Sasikala steps out of her house to wave to supporters. What a night. #OPSvsSasikala pic.twitter.com/gXS92KZJMu â€” Shiv Aroor (@ShivAroor) February 7, 2017 \nShe also accused OPS of conniving with DMK in his rebellion. \"In recent assembly session, opposition leader (Stalin) and Pannerselvam exchanged warmth, they were smiling at each other,\" she told ANI. \nSasikala maintained there was no rift withing the party and \nPannerselvam hits back \nSoon after his expulsion from the party post, OPS hit out at Sasikala. \"I was appointed treasurer by Amma and no-one can take away my post. I don't fear anybody and DMK is no way involved in it,\" he said. \n\"Wait and see what happens today (Wednesday),\" he added. \nOPS becomes an overnight sensation 'Panneerselvam Vazhga' chants outside the MGR/Jaya samadhi.
