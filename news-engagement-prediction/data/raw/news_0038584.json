His withdrawal from consideration is good news for hardworking Americans across the country. It’s time for President Trump to stop looking out for his billionaire buddies, and name a Secretary of Labor who will stand up for workers.”", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F15%2Fwarren-calls-andrew-puzder-withdrawal-good-news%2F6H25FrvKtKKXDVQnnVyEUJ%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Warren", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F15%2Fwarren-calls-andrew-puzder-withdrawal-good-news%2F6H25FrvKtKKXDVQnnVyEUJ%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tWarren", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F15%2Fwarren-calls-andrew-puzder-withdrawal-good-news%2F6H25FrvKtKKXDVQnnVyEUJ%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Warren", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2F02%2F15%2Fwarren-calls-andrew-puzder-withdrawal-good-news%2F6H25FrvKtKKXDVQnnVyEUJ%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Warren"], "published": "2017-02-15T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T04:46:45.813+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
