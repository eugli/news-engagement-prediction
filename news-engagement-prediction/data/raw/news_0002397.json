Now that we’re likely less than a month out from the final release of the device by Samsung to the world, it’s time to see what the rest of the market is up against. Images released by 3D design artists have tipped off the finder details of the device – now we’re getting down to brass tacks – so to speak. \nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 will be powerful – as is generally the case with Samsung’s top-end phones, but it will not be rugged. A premium design here in 2017 means little in the way of making sure the clumsy users amongst us are taken care of. Past warnings about the lack of repairability in the Galaxy S7 Edge will likely hold true for the Galaxy S8 and its larger edition according to one source familiar with the situation who wished to remain anonymous. A bigger display surface and less protective edge than ever before means a lovely looking device, but little in the way of self-safekeeping. \nOutside of that, our gathered details remain largely the same as we’ve reported in the recent past. Two different Galaxy S8 models, both with largely the same look. Both devices have the same amount of pixels in their display, while the larger has a larger panel. Both devices seem to be at or above 90% frontside display coverage. \nSamsung Galaxy S8 • Display: 5.8-inch Super AMOLED with 1440 x 2650 pixel resolution (that’s Quad HD, or 2K) with curved edges on left and right sides – reinforced (Gorilla?) glass on front and back • Operating System: Android 7.1 Nougat • Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 / Samsung Exynos 10-nm SoC dependent on region • RAM: 4GB RAM • Camera: Dual-lens 16MP/8MP(wide) back-facing camera with f/1.7 optics, 4K video recording abilities, dual-LED flash • Front-facing camera: 8-megapixel wide-angle lens with f/1.7 optics. • Internal Storage: 64GB with 256GB-capable microSD card slot for storage expansion • Other Features: Fingerprint scanner on back, Metal frame, Gorilla Glass front and back, Wireless charging, USB-C, no front-facing physical home button \nSamsung Galaxy S8 (Plus?) • Display: 6.2-inch Super AMOLED with 1440 x 2650 pixel resolution (that’s Quad HD, or 2K) with curved edges on left and right sides – reinforced (Gorilla?) glass on front and back • Operating System: Android 7.1 Nougat • Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 / Samsung Exynos 10-nm SoC dependent on region • RAM: 4GB RAM • Camera: Dual-lens 16MP/8MP(wide) back-facing camera with f/1.7 optics, 4K video recording abilities, dual-LED flash • Front-facing camera: 8-megapixel wide-angle lens with f/1.7 optics. • Internal Storage: 64GB with 256GB-capable microSD card slot for storage expansion • Other Features: Fingerprint scanner on back, Metal frame, Gorilla Glass front and back, Wireless charging, USB-C, no front-facing physical home button \nThe specifications listed above are based on rumors, insider tips (anonymously sourced), and strongly implicated information from Samsung itself. None of this is official until Samsung says it is at whatever event they hold for the Galaxy S8 and its “Plus” co-release. \nWe’ll be getting our eyeballs on the real-deal Samsung Galaxy S8 and its larger sibling in the next few weeks. Samsung will likely show off a few things at Mobile World Congress at the tail end of February 2017, but the Galaxy S8 will be held off just a bit longer. Until then, stick to the Samsung portal and let us know if you’re going to get this, a potential Pixel 2 , or an LG G6 – or something else!
