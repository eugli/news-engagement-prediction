Here is our Lion movie review. \nLion Cast: Dev Patel, Sunny Pawar, Nicole Kidman, David Wenham, Rooney Mara, Priyanka Bose, Deepti Naval, Tannishtha Chatterjee, Nawazuddin Siddiqui \nLion Director: Garth Davis \nLion Rating: (4.5/5) \nMost film reviews are simply an assembly of fancy adjectives, the reviewer expresses his experience of watching a particular film and comments on the quality of cinema & performances but somehow ends up showboating courtesy his own subconscious agenda of hyping this 2 hour long audio-visual experience with his cleverly crafted script which essentially is a commentary on his personal interests rather than cinema. \nKeeping that theme in mind what would be the most accurate expression, the core emotion, the underlying affect of this film? \n'Lion' directed by debutant Aussie filmmaker Garth Davis simply embarrassed me, at many levels. \nThe movie is based on the real-life miracle story of 5 year old 'Saroo' played by the immensely adorable & ridiculously gifted 8 year old child star Sunny Pawar, who it seems was destined to play this part as he was selected after more than 2000 kids auditioned for the role. \nSaroo is born in acute poverty but this child carries infectious warmth, one that defines strength of character even at that very young age. Unfortunately for Saroo he finds himself thousands of kilometers away from his doting mother after he gets separated from his brother and unknowingly boards a train to Kolkata. As a viewer I watched in stunned silence as this little kid fought hard to survive in an urban jungle, the sequences shot on Sunny Pawar which include bit scenes with Tannishtha Chatterjee, Nawazuddin Siddqui and Dipti Naval are riveting. It was like the director held my hand and took me on this incredible journey of hope & survival and dare I say this could only be achieved by a foreign filmmaker simply because he captured what he saw. \nThe horror on our streets, millions deprived of basic amenities, their life - a recurring accident. Accidents that we witness every day, we look through them rather than looking at them thus I sincerely believe that no Indian filmmaker is capable of making such a film. \nAmitabh Bachchan lashed out at Slumdog Millionaire being hailed by the west as the first half of Danny Boyle's Oscar winning epic was also about kids surviving ghetto rules. In fact Mira Nair's Oscar nominated 'Salaam Bombay' also revolved around a similar theme, back in 2009 Mr Bachchan wrote: 'If Slumdog Millionaire projects India as [a] third-world, dirty, underbelly developing nation and causes pain and disgust among nationalists and patriots, let it be known that a murky underbelly exists and thrives even in the most developed nations'. \nYes, that's true poverty is everywhere, it is a global epidemic but unlike the west what have we achieved cinematically, in terms of highlighting and presenting these stories which belong to an overwhelming majority of this country?. Not only do we lack the talent or the vision to make such films we also lack the will, grit and empathy required to understand the importance of such cinema. \nComing back to the film, Saroo is adopted by Sue and John Brierly an Australian couple played by Nicole Kidman & David Wenham. From the streets of Kolkata to the beaches of Australia, Saroo grows up to be an ideal son and young Sunny Pawar turns into Dev Patel. The film then revolves around Saroo's excruciatingly painful search for his family back home as he is haunted by the memories of his biological family. \nRemember I said this film embarrassed me on many levels, it is extremely embarrassing to watch a near perfect 'real' Indian story made by a foreign director rather than one of our own cause we were too busy shooting item numbers & then this film somehow repeatedly slapped me in the face and made me aware of my surroundings. When I drive my sedan, shuffling between 'Tupac' and 'The Weeknd', contemplating skipping dinner as I've gained some extra weight, I am literally driving through human beings, citizens of this country who'd smile and pray for me in exchange of a half empty mineral water bottle. \nIn conclusion 'Lion' is a film that defines India, here is a guy who was in a sense handpicked by god placed in paradise as opposed to hell but he wants to go back, the adversity he saw and faced as a young child formed a bond that could not be broken and it is that magical quality and love that unites our unique country together. \nEven though it is not a frontrunner for bagging the Oscar award for best film this year, I hope the academy comes to its senses and rightfully awards Lion the honour. \nI'm going with 4.5/5 for Lion, with a tear in your eye and a smile on your face the film takes you back to reality.
