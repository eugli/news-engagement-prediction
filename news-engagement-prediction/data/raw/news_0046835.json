By: FE Online | Published: February 21, 2017 1:43 PM Cops have been deployed across several locations as ‘shadow police’ to track what is happening across shooting sets. \nWhat had first emerged as an incident of abduction and molestation involving a Malayalam actress is fast turning into a crime that was well-planned and points to a nexus between criminals, drug peddlers and some stakeholders from the Malayalam film industry. More details are awaited from the police on the latest development in their investigation. However, in a significant move, the Kerala police have launched a crackdown on checking the antecedents of workers who are employed in the Malayalam film industry, following the abduction and molestation of a popular actress. \nProduction houses in the state have been directed not to engage workers who have a criminal background. This is the first time that Kerala police have sent out an instruction like this to the film industry. Another update reported on local news channels is that Pulsar Sunil – the main accomplice in the molestation case – was known for hosting rave parties. According to reports in Manorama news, the state intelligence wing has now pointed out that Kerala’s movie shooting locations are “dens of narcotic abuse.” \nCops have been deployed across several locations as ‘shadow police’ to track what is happening across shooting sets. This abduction case has come as a shocker for not just the industry but for the whole state and has opened a can of worms, so to speak. It points to the active presence of drug peddlers and criminals in the film industry that had enjoyed a sparkling clean reputation till now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T20:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T10:52:50.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
