(Glenn Graham) \nWhen Will Thomas finally hit a baseline jumper for the Cougars' first basket of the quarter, with just 2:51 remaining, the Gaels had already built a double-digit advantage to take hold of the game. In the midst of the Gaels' 10-0 run prior to the Thomas basket, James Bishop (11 points) had a steal and lay-up, and Morsell and Smith made two free throws apiece. \nThey also got a big blocked shot from senior Nigel Jackson and a hustle play from Smith, who chased down an offensive rebound in the right corner and, as he was going out of bounds, hit the ball off a Cougar to give the Gaels another possession. \nIt's been an incredible week for Smith, who was named the Baltimore Catholic League Player of the Year on Monday, followed that with a team-high 15 points in a grinding 54-46 semifinal win over No. 7 McDonogh on Thursday and then saved his best with a stellar second half in Sunday's championship game. Shortly after posing for countless team photos with the new championship plaque, he tried to describe his feelings. It wasn't easy. \n\"It feels really great, but it still hasn't hit me yet. Probably after we get to the locker room and then we leave it will hit me,\" he said. \nMorsell said the fourth quarter came down to getting the defensive stops, rebounding relentlessly and letting the points follow at the offensive end. \n\"We came here last year and was just a little short, so this year just to get the championship in my senior year is a great feeling,\" he said. \"We had that experience from being here last year and we just stuck together and found a way to win.\" \nMount Carmel got strong games from forward Jordan Jones (19 points, nine rebounds) and senior Terry Nolan Jr. (17 points) to stay close with the Gaels, who had beaten them in both regular-season meetings. \nDown 32-25 at the break, the Cougars opened the third quarter with a 9-0 run to take a 34-32 lead. After Smith started his own run for the Gaels, helping them reclaim a 45-41 lead on a put-back with 28 seconds left, the Cougars got the late 3-pointer to make things interesting going into the fourth. \nThe Gaels made sure not to keep things interesting, as they pulled away with a dominating fourth quarter. \nAfter going 13-18 and not qualifying for the MIAA playoffs last year, Mount Carmel has made up a lot of ground this season â€” something coach Hakim Hibbert was proud of, despite coming up short Sunday. \n\"I'm really proud of my guys,\" he said \"I think it's a big building block coming from where we started at last year to this year making the championship game. Mount Saint Joe is a great team, a great program and it was an honor to be on the court to play against them for the championship. \nBoth teams move on to the Baltimore Catholic League tournament, which is set to start at 7 p.m. Thursday with quarterfinal play. \nThe Gaels, seeded first, will host eighth-seeded Loyola Blakefield, while third-seeded Mount Carmel is at home against sixth-seeded Calvert Hall in a rematch of the Cougars' thrilling 66-63 MIAA semifinal win on Thursday. The other quarterfinal games have fourth-seeded John Carroll hosting fifth-seeded Saint Frances and second-seeded Saint Maria Goretti hosting seventh-seeded Archbishop Spalding. \ntwitter.com/GlennGrahamSun", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T05:06:57.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
