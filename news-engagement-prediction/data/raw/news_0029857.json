You feel very alone, like you need someone to talk to but there's noone there,' she said.\nBarbara has spent the last four months in hospital following a near-death experience, but is now raising funds through GoFundMe to leave.\nBefore: The teenager was already battling a number of health conditions, but lived a fairly normal life before her debilitating illness took hold\nAt one point, the teenager said she was told she would be 'going home to die'.\nBut at the same time a glimmer of hope appeared for the teenager. Doctors had begun to see an improvement in her health after she had trialed Total Parental Care.\nTPC is a tube connected to the chest, where a slurry containing Barbara's total nutritional requirements is delivered.\nShe will now spend the rest of her life with the tube.\nIf she is unable to find suitable accommodation for herself where her medical machines and other requirements can be safely stored and kept sterile, Barbara will have to remain in hospital.\nMaking a move: Having spent the past four months in hospital following a near death experience, Barbara is raising money to purchase medical equipment she will need to live outside the health facility and restart her life\nBarbara told Daily Mail Australia she would like to go on to study medicine at university, and wants to become an advocate for people with the rare gastric conditions.\nAs a result, she has turned to the fundraising site to raise money to find a home of her own and pay for her expensive medical equipment.\nThe 19-year-old is fully aware of what she needs to do to live a healthy life outside the sterile walls of the hospital, and has been given a list of things she needs to have before she can leave.\nRisks: She is constantly aware that one wrong move could land her in hospital, or worse, kill her, which is why she wants to be very prepared when she leaves\nThey include machines to monitor her blood sugar and blood pressure, as well as blood sugar strips and needles, a medical trolley and bags to hold her TPC and IV fluids.\nBarbara will also need extra funds to assist with a move and her expected constant trips to and from hospital.\n'If I do one thing wrong outside hospital, I risk a blood infection and ending up in the ICU, I can die,' Barbara said.\n'That scares me every day.'", "external_links": ["https://www.gofundme.com/barbarasmedicalfund"], "published": "2017-02-15T10:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T13:09:04.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
