Grand Blvd. in the heart of New Center. \nThe news comes after the Pistons announced in November their move to downtown starting next season. The Pistons will share Little Caesars Arena, which still is under construction, with the Detroit Red Wings. \nA memorandum agreement with the City of Detroit obligated the Pistons to relocate the rest of their franchise downtown. \nA second location immediately north of the arena was under consideration, but the New Center location apparently is more convenient. \nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan, left, shakes hands with Detroit Pistons owner Tom Gores, right, as Chris Ilitch, Ilitch Holdings, President and CEO, center looks on at a news conference in Detroit, Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2016. The Pistons announced they will move downtown Detroit and begin playing at the new Little Caesars Arena, home of the Detroit Red Wings, starting next season.
