Shahid Kapoor is suave… Damn! Shahid Kapoor is suave and sexy on the latest cover of GQ Shahid Kapoor looks classy on the latest cover of GQ By Snehal Rajani | Updated: February 1, 2017 3:47 pm Shahid Kapoor's sister Sanah is engaged to an actor's son? \nSuave, sexy and dapper – if we had to describe Shahid in three words on the latest cover of GQ, that would be it! Shahid Kapoor has featured on the cover of the latest issue of GQ magazine and man.. he looks bloody hot! Shahid has barely given the fashion police a chance to criticise his style sense and with this one too, he has managed to woo us big time with his style. Sasha has got us swooning in this classy royal blue printed Alessandro Michele Gucci tuxedo with a bowtie to make it look just perfect! His hair and beard is very well kempt. Shahid has done quite a few shoots for GQ before this and this one is equally hot. But there isn’t something new to it. He has looked similar before this and how we wish they could have done something different with their hair or maybe his eyes..since everyone is sporting the kohl-eyed look. But overall, we quite like the cover. Shahid shared the cover and an inside pic on his social media accounts.

The film which also stars Saif Ali Khan and Kangana Ranaut is helmed by Vishal Bhardwaj who has worked with Sasha before on Haider and Kaminey. They are one of the most popular actor-director duo in the film industry and their previous films have done pretty well. Will Rangoon be a box office hit too? Let’s wait and watch. He is currently working on Padmavati which is being directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and also stars Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh in key roles. \nWhat do you have to say about Shahid’s GQ photoshoot?
