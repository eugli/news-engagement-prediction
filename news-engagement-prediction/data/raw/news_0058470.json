But she said further fact-finding is needed to decide whether Fry can pursue her case in court. The ruling could make it easier for disabled students to protect their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nRelated: Lawsuit: Disabled protesters were barred from Capitol lawn event \nLower courts had ruled against Fry, saying she first had to try informally resolving her dispute with Napoleon (Mich.) Community Schools. \nFry’s family sought to use the service dog when Ehlena started kindergarten and suffered from severe mobility problems. Wonder was specially trained to help open doors, pick up items and give Ehlena a measure of independence. \nEhlena Fry sits with her service dog Wonder, while speaking to reporters outside the Supreme Court in Washington on Oct. 31, 2016.

She later transferred to a different public school that welcomed Wonder. \nAt issue is the interplay of two federal disability laws. The school district said it could bar the dog under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which allows a teacher’s aide to assist students instead. That law requires families that contest school decisions to first go through administrative proceedings. \nBut the family said it could sue for damages under a different law, the Americans with Disabilities Act, because the district refused to accommodate Wonder over a 2½ year period. 18 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:20:30.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
