The scene: Australia’s rooms at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The Aussies are celebrating their Second Test win against South Africa when batsman Don Bradman is called to meet the chairman of selectors.\nSir Tristan Goofus: “Come in, young Donald! And congratulations on your latest century.”\nBradman: “Thank you, sir.”\nGoofus: “Please, take a seat. Donald, we’re planning some changes for the next Test. You’ll be moving down the batting order.”\nBradman: “Really, sir? To where?”\nGoofus: “Eleven. And from now on you’ll be a specialist leg-spin bowler.”\nBradman: “But sir, I’ve only ever taken just one Test wicket! And, if my cricinfo.com statistics are accurate, I’ll only ever take one more wicket during my entire Test career!”\nGoofus: “Be that as it may, Donald, but the board believes your current scoring level is unsustainable. It’s important we make crucial transitions now to secure Australia’s long-term cricketing future.”\nmedia_camera Cricket legend and batting powerhouse Don Bradman. Digitally altered image\nThat discussion obviously never took place, because even Sir Tristan on a brandy and opium bender would never have come up with an idea so ludicrous as pushing Bradman down to 11.\nYet that is exactly the policy being pursued by state and federal governments in terms of Australia’s energy supply. We’re demoting coal (Bradman the batsman) and promoting wind and solar (Bradman the bowler).\nIt makes absolutely no sense at all, as was made clear last week in this telling paragraph from the Australian ­Financial Review:\n“Chief Scientist Alan Finkel — who is conducting a review of energy security for the Turnbull government — is about to do a crash course on adapting an outdated energy grid powered by predictable and reliable fossil fuel generators for over a century but now trying to cope with technologies such as wind, solar and battery storage. He’ll visit Ireland, Denmark and the United States, all of which are grappling with the same issue.”\nThat issue being the quest to make energy sources other than predictable and reliable fossil fuels equally predictable and reliable. Chief Scientist Finkel’s energy security review should in fact go no further than noting the energy source used for his flights to Europe and the US.\nWhen their own lives are at stake, even the greenest of green activists would never contemplate using anything besides proven fossil-fuel technology. Until rapid air travel is safely accomplished using something besides predictable and reliable fossil fuel, why the hell should our entire economy consider switching?\nDo we really want the whole country to follow South Australia’s example by demolishing coal-fired power plants, installing massive wind farms and then sitting around without electricity when the wind doesn’t blow?\nApparently we do.\nmedia_camera We’re demoting coal (Bradman the batsman) and promoting wind and solar (Bradman the bowler), says Tim Blair.\nEnergy Networks Australia chief John Bradley told a Senate inquiry hearing last week that state and federal governments needed to agree on a national “road map” to cut carbon emissions while somehow at the same time ensuring power remains affordable and dependable.\n“While the finger-pointing and uncertainty in the policy environment continues we are setting customers up for higher costs and less secure transition to a lower-carbon economy,” Bradley said.\nBut South Australians aren’t being “set up” for higher costs and greater unreliability. They’ve already got both, thanks to a state Labor government’s carbon-reduction aims.\nYou know what would make renewable energy both viable and reliable? A carbon price. That’s according to various experts who think taxes solve problems instead of causing them.\n“It’s just what the investors, operators, major users, regulators and leading economists say,” Hawker Britton’s Simon Banks, who modestly bills himself as “one of Australia’s most highly respected government relations, campaigning and strategic communications professionals”, wrote last week. “But hey, what would they know?”\nOne group is noticeably absent from Banks’s list: engineers. That’s because engineers understand Newton’s First Law of Motion, which states that “every object will remain at rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change its state by the action of an external force.”\nIn other words, a stupid South Australian wind turbine won’t spin unless the wind is blowing. A carbon price doesn’t qualify as an external force, at least in a physical sense.\nYet still we’re barging ahead to a blackout-guaranteed renewable energy future. Labor aims for wind, solar and hydro to produce 50 per cent of our electricity by 2030. The Coalition aims for 23 per cent from the same sources. This is happening in a nation so rich in coal that it alone could power us for centuries.\nAnd that’s before we even mention our uranium reserves. When it comes to reliable power, nuclear is Don Bradman the batsman and Shane Warne the bowler all combined in one fantastic fission package.\nToo bad the Sir Tristan Goofuses in government only allow our greatest star to play for other countries.\nART BUFFS TO COP A CONTEMPORARY GAWP AT MCA’S NUDE DAY ONE of the more pleasant aspects of Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art is that most patrons keep their clothes on.\nNow, I’m no oil painting — neither are many of the works on display at the MCA, for that matter — but you really don’t want to see contemporary art fans getting around naked.\nAll that is set to change next month, however, when the MCA will stage a “special iteration of Stuart Ringholt’s Naturist Tour”. This means that for just $25, or $20 if you’re an MCA member, lucky museum visitors will get to nude up.\n“Gain a new perspective on the MCA Collection by viewing it nude,” its website promises. “Remove the material barriers between artist and audience for a morning naturist tour followed by a breakfast.\n“The work deals with themes of fear and embarrassment and the potentially liberating effects of enjoying art in the nude.”\nSounds … great. But a couple of conditions are involved. One is the time. Naked art lovers will only be permitted between the hours of seven and nine on the morning of March 8. Anyone turning up earlier or later in a clothes-free state will presumably face the usual penalties.\nmedia_camera Nude day at the MCA. Supplied/Twitter\nThe other condition is potentially more problematic. Because this morning of nakidity is being held on International Women’s Day, it’s only open to ladies. “The MCA affirms that experiences of womanhood are many and varied,” the museum declares. “We bear witness to this great variety and welcome women from all cultures, and with all bodies, to take part in this artwork.”\nTherein lies the problem. Your modern art types are more likely than most to agree with the bizarre contemporary notion of gender fluidity, which rejects the concept of gender being defined by biology. To get around this obvious issue, the MCA’s invitation is worded very carefully. The great morning gear-off, the MCA warns, is “open only to people who identify as women.”\nWell, this could be interesting.\nDaily Telegraph readers are famously fascinated by modern art, yet those born biologically male may feel they are banned from this intriguing occasion — unless, of course, they chose to identify as women on the morning in question.\nWho at the MCA, for example, would dare question Barry the Silverwater tradie’s brave female identification? He’s always felt constrained by society’s imposed gender definition and would be liberated by two hours of naked art gazing with his fellow “people who identify as women”.\nIf naked Barry is turned away on March 8 it will be proof the MCA is disgustingly supportive of outmoded gender binary oppression.\nFor this event, the MCA is supplying change rooms.
