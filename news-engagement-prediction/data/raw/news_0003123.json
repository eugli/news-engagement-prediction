A recent survey by Tourism New Zealand found that about a fifth of locals think the country is attracting too many tourists, the report stated, with road accidents, traffic congestion, overcrowding, insufficient infrastructure and environmental impacts cited as chief concerns. \nJay Finlayson, vice-president of Federated Mountain Clubs, a national association of climbing and tramping clubs, said in a recent blog post that many holidaying Kiwis will be witness to the downsides of booming tourism this summer. \n\"Its impacts on infrastructure are obvious; roads, carparks, campsites, conservation honey pots, even recreation access across private land, all are creaking under the load, much of which is down to sheer numbers,\" Finlayson said. 123RF \nA McKinsey report suggests charging a hiking fee for the Great Walks. \nGreater competition for popular holiday and camping spots and more boots on once peaceful hiking trails, particularly the nine Great Walks maintained by the Department of Conservation (DOC), are also irking many. Ad Feedback \nWellington resident Karen Fisher, who did two of the Great Walks over Christmas, alongside thousands of tourists, was cited saying that \"Because of the easy accessibility and the numerous day trip tours available, the tracks in the Abel Tasman National Park were very crowded during the day\". \nHuts are now booked months in advance and camp sites along trails are becoming increasingly scarce, forcing many to hike for longer. \nThere is growing resentment that New Zealand taxpayers are having to pick up the bill for mounting costs for infrastructure, waste removal, cleaning camp grounds and other expenses. \nA report by international consultancy firm McKinsey found that DOC covers just five per cent of its costs on average from user pays, markedly lower than the some 20 per cent for national parks in Australia, the US and Canada. \nThe report, commissioned by various tourism sector and other stakeholders, suggested funding options such as a hiking fee for the Great Walks, a conservation tax for tourists, parking charges at popular spots and privatising the walks. \nTourism Minister Paula Bennett was cited saying that DOC is exploring options with the tourism sector and other stakeholders. \n\"No decisions have been made but a number of options for alternative funding are being considered, such as differential fees for international and domestic visitors,\" she added. \nIn Finlayson's view, New Zealand's tourism strategy should be \"based on principles that prioritise us, our home here, and our long-term future\". \n\"Our national identity is tied up in Aotearoa's hills, where the cash economy barely registers,\" he later added. \n\"It's a place of nature on nature's terms, egalitarian and healthy, a place of adventure, food-gathering, camaraderie, and many stories. New Zealanders' relationships with and within the great outdoors should unquestionably be safeguarded.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:33:57.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
