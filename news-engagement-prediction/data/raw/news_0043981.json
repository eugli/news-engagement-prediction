While his predecessor Mistry wanted to end the road for the doomed 'People' s car', Chandrasekaran will have to take a call how long its journey could be continued as it has accumulated losses exceeding Rs 1,000 crore. \n\nAs such, Tata Motors has set a target of making all its business units profitable. He will have to address how the group can help in making the company's passenger vehicles business unit with or without the Nano. \n\nGroup observers will be keenly watching Chandrasekaran's relationship with Tata Trusts and their trustees considering how Mistry accused them of interference and developing alternate power centre making him a \"lame duck\" Chairman. \n\nInterestingly, his predecessor Mistry was sacked for \"growing and untenable trust deficit between Tata Sons and the Tata Trusts.\" \n\nOn January 12, the TCS chief was named as the Chairman of Tata Sons, capping two months of the most bitter boardroom battle in corporate history that followed the unceremonious sacking of Cyrus Mistry and letting of bad blood ever since. \n\nAn avid photographer and a passionate long-distance runner having completed several marathons around the world including Amsterdam, Boston, Chicago, Berlin, Mumbai, New York, Prague, Stockholm, Salzburg and Tokyo, all eyes are now on Chandrasekaran on how he tackles the course.
