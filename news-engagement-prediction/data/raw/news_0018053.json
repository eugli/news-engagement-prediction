Jackson took what appeared to be another dig at forward Carmelo Anthony in a tweet on Feb. 7, 2017. (Photo: AP) \nThe New York Knicks have had a lot of problems this season , and on Wednesday night, things only got much worse. \nDuring the Knicks' loss to the Clippers, Charles Oakley was escorted out of the building and arrested , and after the game, Carmelo Anthony didn't sound too confident when asked about whether or not he still trusts franchise president Phil Jackson. \nFollowing that disaster of a night, Jackson took to Twitter on Thursday to say this: So after starting a üî•storm with a misunderstood tweet, I offer this‚úåüèªour society is torn with discord. I'm against it. Let It Be ‚Äî Phil Jackson (@PhilJackson11) February 9, 2017 \nThe first part of that is pretty clear, but the second half isn't, so uh, here's an attempt to break it down, like we did with Jackson's last tweet : \nSo after starting a (fire emoji) storm with a misunderstood tweet, \nOn Tuesday, Jackson sent out this tweet that was seen as a shot at Anthony , perhaps even meant to push Anthony to consider waiving his no-trade clause. Bleacher's Ding almost rings the bell, but I learned you don't change the spot on a leopard with Michael Graham in my CBA daze. ‚Äî Phil Jackson (@PhilJackson11) February 7, 2017 \nNow, apparently, Jackson is saying that the tweet was \"misunderstood,\" which, I guess he could say since the tweet is pretty hard to understand. \nI offer this (two fingers emoji) \nI believe this translates to, \"I offer this peace,\" as in he's trying to mend things. Lots of emojis this time. \nour society is torn with discord. \nThis part can be interpreted in many different ways. \nMaybe Jackson is talking about his conflict with Anthony or maybe he's referring to Oakley being arrested for, in the Knicks' words, behaving in a \" highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner\" - or maybe he means society in general. \nI'm against it. \nWhatever Jackson was referring to out of those three things above, he's against it. \nLet It Be. \nAll of the words are uppercase here, so my first guess is that he's talking about The Beatles song, Let It Be . But whether or not it's meant to be the title of the song or just saying \"let it be,\" it's weird. He's saying that he's against discord, but that he or the media or Oakley or Anthony or fans or whoever he's subtweeting here should just stop trying to mess with it? Wouldn't a better thing be to fix it, though? \nThat's where it ends. Stay tuned for FTW's next edition of Trying to decipher Phil Jackson's Tweet.
