I've never leaked or backgrounded against anyone. And I certainly won't start now.\" External Link: Abbott speaks after losing Liberal leadership \nHe was setting himself a high bar in the recent history of Australian politics, and the former prime minster has failed to clear it. \nTwo weeks after making that statement, Mr Abbott waded back into the political fray in a wide-ranging interview on commercial radio. \nHe took a relatively conciliatory tone — but insisted he could have won the next election if he had not been knifed. \nA period of silence followed. One Coalition MP close to Mr Abbott said he was coming to terms with his loss of power. \nMalcolm Turnbull remained ascendant in the polls. Mr Abbott's backers spoke of the former prime minister in gentle tones, and in the past tense. \nIn 2016, Mr Abbott returned to Canberra with a more grim set to his face. \nHe felt the Government was drifting. He seemed to believe the Coalition had abandoned the animating principles of conservatism which his government had tried — however imperfectly — to keep faith with. \nHe was also clearly infuriated when government frontbenchers blamed the Abbott government for policy drift or its yawning budget deficit.

(AAP: Alan Porritt) A series of challenges \nIn February, Mr Abbott penned a 4,000-word essay for conservative journal Quadrant defending his time in office, maintaining again that he would have won the last election, and arguing that his achievements as prime minister would \"stand the test of time\" . \nHe went further the next month — issuing a direct challenge to Mr Turnbull in the party room and demanding he do more to curb government spending. \nAt the time the Prime Minister was engaging in a careful exercise of differentiation in the lead up to the federal election, insisting there had been \"significant changes\" to the Coalition government under his watch. \nMr Abbott was quick to scotch that argument, arguing the Turnbull Government was essentially standing on his legacy. \nThe former prime minister was also increasingly keen to take on the mantle of the Coalition's \"conservative conscience\". \nIn June, he criticised those who described the white settlement of Australia as an invasion. \nIn September he accused his successor of responding \"in panic\" to a Four Corners program on juvenile detention by calling a royal commission. \nIn October he clashed with the Prime Minister over the Adler shotgun, and in November he again took up the cudgels for budget austerity, telling the Government to revive some of the unpopular spending cuts from his 2014 budget. \nAnd as Christmas approached he took to social media to lecture the party leadership about the risks of abandoning the party's conservative base. \nAll of this was bad enough for Mr Turnbull. But in 2017 it got worse, as Mr Abbott's frustration curdled into anger. \nIn less than two months, he has:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:36:41.195+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
