By Pooja Nayak | Updated: February 23, 2017 10:36 am Say what? Mira Rajput invites Shahid Kapoor's ex on his pre-birthday bash? – check out pic \nWho hasn’t gone through a bad past? Who hasn’t faced the lows of life? What really matters is how you overcome your weakness and move ahead in life – Kangana Ranaut being the best example. Being an ‘outsider’, the actress has faced severe backlash personally as well as professionally but today, she’s known as the ‘Queen’ of Bollywood or like we choose to believe – she’s ‘Once a queen, always a queen”. Doesn’t that say it all? In conversation with the one and only Kangana Ranaut ahead of her upcoming film, Rangoon that’s releasing this Friday. Read on… \nWho is your biggest critic back home? Your sister or your mother? \nNone, coz they love all my films. Otherwise, I like constructive criticisms and I always look up to it. I have a few critics who I have high regards for and I look forward to what their feedback is towards my work. But talking about my family, my brother’s favourite film is Double Dhamaal so you can figure out the criticism. (Laughs). He loves Double Dhamaal and he thinks that’s the high point in my career. He was really thrilled to see me in that film so definitely, their opinions don’t matter too much. \nQuiz her about Shahid’s remark where he tagged her as a woman with ‘vivid imaginations’ and she said… \n“That he has borrowed from Hrithik. It is completely borrowed and Hrithik should have a copyright of this statement. I feel everyone should have their own statements and not borrow statements. But ya coming back to what I said was, that we were sharing this cottage and I like to listen to instrumental music and Shahid likes to listen to hip hop. So I didn’t say it was a nightmare but I just joked about it and how we used to then take turns. \nTalking about the sleaziness with which her kiss with Shahid in Rangoon has been discussed, Kangana adds… \n“It’s very intimate, very awkward to perform an intimate scene. It’s never a kiss, it’s literally an imitation of intimacy because how can you literally get intimate in front of 50 people. You of course can arouse yourself as an actor, you are supposed to build that emotion in you. You do that but then again, it’s an imitation of a situation. If we are in World War 2 it’s not World War 2, it’s an imitation of an event and that’s what artists do and they should be respected for that. But how they ask with a sleazy undertone and to give it some dignity, I said that with all the mud and 50 people around and you know your co-actor is complaining about a cold, of course it’s not about a sleazy expression that one it trying to give. (She’s referring to the interview where she about kissing Shahid with a ‘runny nose’ and a “horrible moustache”. \nOn the personal front, ask her if it’s a bad idea to date an actor considering her past relationships… \nI have dated a doctor, an actor, a model…I have dated many men unfortunately in the past but the learning is the same. (laughs) When it doesn’t work, it just doesn’t work. \nProbe her about her current relationship status given that she’s finally confessed she’s in love again… \n(Nods in agreement with a slight blush on her face and says), Yes! \nDo you feel the maternal instincts setting in? Is that why you want to get married? \nWell, that’s not the reason to get married but to have a companion and a relationship is the reason. \nHow many kids would you want to have? \nMe? Let’s see how many I can manage? (laughs) \nHere, watch the FULL interview below: \nConsidering she’s upfront about everything under the sun, I further tricked her on what do stars mean when they say the following and there…she takes on every question like a boss… \nI don’t think marriage has anything to do with being offered good roles – Ans: “It means that they are ready to work even after marriage” \nWe are just good friends – Ans: I think it’s just when people are trying to link a couple and then they just say they are just friends. They are just trying to emphasise on the fact that they are friends. And also, I don’t think sometimes people are just dishonest about it coz relationships can go through phases from seeing to dating to relationship to commitment. And sometimes you know, you just have that physical comfort but you really don’t mean anything more than that. What are you supposed to tell the world? You can’t say that “hey, we are figuring it out” You simply say that we’re just friends. \nKill marry hook up – Ranbir, Ranveer or Shahid? \nWell, I am going to marry someone so let’s just….and if I kill someone then that person would also now…(pauses) You know how it gets printed in Hindi newspaper –“Yeh iski hatya karna chahti hai”( She wants to kill him)..", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:42:12.855+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
