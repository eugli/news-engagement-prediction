Is the death penalty dying out in the US? \nGovernor Kasich explained that the legal challenge necessitated the delay, but that he is confident that the state will win the appeal, and resume with the scheduled executions. \n\"These delays are necessary to allow the judicial process to come to a full resolution, and ensure that the state can move forward with the executions after the appeal is settled,\" Mr Kasich said. \nThe US Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati will hear arguments on 21 February.

Only 20 were carried out in 2016.
