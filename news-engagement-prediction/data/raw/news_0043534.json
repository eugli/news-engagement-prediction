Kim reckons she has figured out who the father of Denise's baby is in EastEnders \nThe hugely popular 2011 pop song is a call for equality among everyone and was performed by Iron Sun, one of the five-piece bands hoping to win the BBC talent show and go on tour the UK as part of a new musical based on the songs of Take That. \nHowever as they sang their edited version of the track, which was cut for length only (each performance is allocated around three minutes), viewers noticed that key parts of the lyrics had been left out. \nNamely, the obvious parts about equality and diversity. \n‘So the BBC edited Born This Way for #letitshine so it didn’t mention any LGBT references. Surely that’s the whole message of the song?’ asked one confused viewer, watching at home, while another got a little more straight to the point: ‘As if they f**king had to straighten up Born This Way. F**k off BBC.’ The key part of Born This Way cut by the BBC \nDon’t be a drag, just be a queen Whether you’re broke or evergreen You’re black, white, beige, chola descent You’re Lebanese, you’re orient Whether life’s disabilities Left you outcast, bullied, or teased Rejoice and love yourself today’cause baby you were born this way \nNo matter gay, straight, or bi, Lesbian, transgendered life, I’m on the right track baby, I was born to survive. No matter black, white or beige Chola or orient made, I’m on the right track baby, I was born to be brave. So the BBC edited Born This Way for #letitshine so it didn't mention any LGBT references. Surely that's the whole message of the song? ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:39:12.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
