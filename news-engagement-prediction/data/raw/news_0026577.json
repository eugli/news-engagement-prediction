Boone, 82, ​lambasted​ Meryl Streep for her Golden Globes speech in January where she denounced Donald Trump's ideology and accused him of mocking disabled reporter Serge Kovaleski in his campaign. The Moody River singer said he feels that she refused to give Trump a 'chance,' as well as saying Hollywood shuts out conservatives and is '99% liberal,' to the detriment of the nation's image around the world. Show business legend Pat Boone has come out firing at stars who use award​s season to launch rants at the U.S. President and his policies The singer feels that she refused to give Trump a 'chance,' as well as saying Hollywood shuts out conservatives and is '99% liberal,' to the detriment of the nation's image around the world He spoke while arriving at the 25th Annual Movieguide Awards, which celebrates faith-based and family movies. Boone, who has enjoyed seven decades of stardom, claimed that many modern actors and actresses are destroying the industry by making 'degraded' films simply due to their liberal views. 'Now, first of all, I don’t think that award shows are the place to express some narrow political view,' he said when the subject of Streep's speech was mentioned. 'Now, it’s not narrow to her, or to most of that audience. But to most of America, who had elected a man that she detests and doesn’t wanna even give a chance to.' Boone, 82, ​lambasted​ ​three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep for her Golden Globes speech last month where she denounced leader Donald Trump's ideology and accused him of mocking disabled reporter Serge Kovaleski in his campaign Bone cited Trump's Electoral College victory and his voters' conviction that 'he’s gonna lead us into a more moral and a more economically sound and military strong life. She doesn’t wanna give him even a chance, and she was acting like he was all but criminal and depraved. And, course, she got a big hand for it.' He conceded: 'Now, she’s a nice woman and a very talented woman. But I don’t think that an award show in front of millions of people is the place to vent your spleen about somebody that you disagree with politically. It just was wrong.' Boone dismissed the idea her speech could have harmed her professionally, pointing out that 'she’s in the side of the career that applauds it. Oh, no, it’s good for her.' Calling Streep 'nice' and 'very talented,' he insisted that 'I don’t think that an award show in front of millions of people is the place to vent your spleen about somebody that you disagree with politically' He noted that 'In fact, there’s some who’ll express those views knowing it may be good for ‘em, poli- I mean, in the industry, in the industry, in Hollywood. Yeah, because liberals love liberals. They don’t want – they don’t like conservatives.' Conservatism, per Boone, 'can cost many people careers. The guy, the – the actor that stood up at the Trump, when – he was – let’s see, it was – oh, when he was winning the nomination.' Though 'He’s not that well known,' to the point Boone forgot his name, he was 'speaking up for Trump. And he had two film projects that were in the works, and as soon as he did that for Trump, those two projects were canceled. Because he was gonna have to – it was gonna be liberals dealing with him in his projects.' Long history: Boone (right) campaigned with Ronald Reagan (second from left) as far back as the latter's successful 1966 run for the California governorship; they are pictured in 1985 with Natalie Cole (left), Tom Brokaw (center) and Nancy Reagan (right) Boone (center) continued plugging the Gipper (left) into 1984, when the then-President ran for a second term and won the biggest electoral landslide in U.S. history; they are pictured during a 1985 speech to National Religious Broadcasters with Jerry Falwell (right) Happy Days alumnus Scott Baio spoke at the Republican National Convention last June, where Trump was declared the party's nominee. Baio, a vocal advocate of Trump, has not himself said publicly that he lost any specific jobs as a consequence of his convention gig. When The Hollywood Reporter asked him about the possibility his speech might cost him work, he said: 'I’ll give you a very simple answer: I don’t care. I genuinely, in my heart, do not care if I ever work again. I don’t care. I’m comfortable and I’ve got a great life, but If I don’t have a country that is recognizable to me, I’ve got nothing.' Baio did mention during that interview - which took place last August - that 'I’m in the process right now of developing two things.' His last acting credit on IMDb dates back to 2014. Boone said at the Friday evening awards event that Hollywood's aversion to conservatives 'is that real. It is that divisive. And somehow I’ve managed to survive, because I’m not dependent on Hollywood.' His squad: Pat with his family posting in the latest fashions in 1972 The singer has no shortage of conservative bona fides, having campaigned with Ronald Reagan as far back as the latter's successful 1966 run for the California governorship. Boone continued plugging the Gipper into 1984, when the then-President ran for a second term and won the biggest electoral landslide in U.S. history. Friday evening, Boone noted that 'politically Hollywood is almost 99 per cent liberal. Not to say leftist, that is towards socialism and not wanting any abridgment of anything they want to do if they can make a buck doing it.' As he described himself, 'I’m a conservative politically and I have felt that moral guidelines are for our good: The good of our nation, the good of our family and Hollywood seems to have no moral guidelines.' Said he: 'They have compassion. They’ll do charitable things for people, but then they make movies that tend to glamorize things that are really degraded.' 'We used to export films that presented America in a very favorable eye, so that we were kind of the envy of the world, because of the picture we presented,' he said. Conservative upbringing: Pat with Lindy Boone, Debby Boone, Laury Boone, Cherry Boone in 1958 Boone has continued to record ​music ​and appear in movies He went on that 'it is almost an anathema to say that you’re a Republican in Hollywood, or that you’re a conservative. You may not get any jobs. You have to be very popular to be employed if you’re a conservative, because they just don’t want to hire you.' In his view, 'There’s a political and emotional and philosophical antipathy toward people who think along what to them seem to be more narrow, moral lines. They don’t want anybody telling them what they can and can’t do, or what’s right and what’s wrong and they don’t want to reflect that in films.' As a result, 'you see actresses who either have kids already, or will, rutting - literally - in movie scenes, nude and simulated sex,' during which 'I’m thinking: \"Hey, you’ve got kids that one of these days are going to see their mom doing this on a screen and other peoples kids may be seeing you now.\"' Recently he appeared in a string of Christian films as he felt they carried a strong moral message for ​audiences; he is pictured at the premiere of God's Not Dead 2 last March Moreover, 'I won’t name names, but I know that some of these actresses, once they feel they’re just about through, they do tell all books and they talk about the affairs they had with other actors and that kind of thing. And I’m thinking: \"You’re a grandmother. Why do you want to do this?\"' Asked if he was concerned about Hollywood, he replied: 'Oh yeah. Hollywood should be presenting the very best picture of America and who the average people want to be. We used to win awards with movies that show people in the best possible light. Now, more and more people get awards for being a vampire,' he said with a grin. Pat boasts an astonishing career in the business. He sold almost 50 million records in his singing career in the 1950s and 60s, before hosting his won TV variety show on prime time TV, He then became a best selling author sharing his feelings on his Christian faith. At one point on Friday, Boone appeared to be speaking about actor Scott Baio, who spoke in favor of Trump at the Republican National Convention last summer Share or comment on this article 16", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T03:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:13:53.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
