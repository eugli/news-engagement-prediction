Media caption Five things we learned about President Trump from his address to conservative activists. \nAddressing the Conservative Political Action Congress (CPAC) in Maryland on Friday, President Trump vowed to always put American citizens first and build a \"great, great border wall\". \n\"We're building the wall,\" he said. \"In fact it's going to start very soon. Way ahead of schedule. It's way, way, way ahead of schedule.\" \nMr Trump has pledged that Mexico will pay for the wall, which could cost up to $21.5bn (£17.2bn), according to Reuters, which cited a Department of Homeland Security internal report. \nThe figure is much higher than Mr Trump's estimated price tag of $12bn (£9.6bn). \nThe president has proposed to levy a 20% tax on Mexican imports to pay for a border wall. \nIn a radio interview on Friday, Mr Videgeray said that \"Mexico believes in free trade\", but \"would have to respond\" if the US tried to fund a border wall by imposing a tax on Mexican imports. \n\"What we cannot do is remain with our arms crossed,\" he said. \n\"Mexico will face this as a reality and not just as a rhetorical threat because we have realised that rhetorical threats come and go.\" \nAccording to reports, the foreign minister has previously identified states including Iowa, Texas and Wisconsin as possible targets for retaliatory tariffs. \nMexico is by far the top destination for Texan exports, with goods worth $92.4bn exported there in 2015, according to the US Department of Commerce . \nThe wall is a sensitive political subject in Mexico. President Enrique Pena Nieto cancelled a trip to meet Mr Trump last month over the dispute and has said Mexico will not fund the wall. \nOn Thursday US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly met their Mexican counterparts in Mexico City. \nNeither side made any mention of the wall in Thursday's news conference after their closed-door meetings. \nPresident Trump needs Congressional approval for funding before moving forward with construction of the wall.
