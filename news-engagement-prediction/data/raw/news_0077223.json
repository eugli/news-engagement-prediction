(Corbis/Getty Images) \nChelsea will have the chance to sign Leonardo Bonucci from Juventus for £42 million this summer, according to reports. \nThe Sun claims that the Serie A champions are open to offers for the 29-year-old, and would find it difficult to turn down a £42m offer as they view Daniele Rugani and Mattia Caldara as their long-term defensive partnership. \nThe report also suggests that Antonio Conte, who wants to bolster his squad at Chelsea with one marquee defender, views Bonucci as his ideal signing. Antonio Conte managed Bonucci with Italy’s national side. (Getty Images) Bonucci won three Serie A titles with Conte at Juventus. (AFP/Getty Images) \nEarlier this month, Bonucci was involved in a heated exchange with Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri during the 4-1 victory over Palermo. \nThe Italy international was subsequently left out of the squad for the 2-0 win over Porto in the Champions League last week.
