The party said Zuma’s speech carried little weight and was just smoke and mirrors. \nZuma focused on economic transformation, university fees, land, and corruption. \nHe said his “caring” government would look into the prospect of raising the National Student Financial Aid Scheme threshold to above R122 000, in phases. Students from families earning below R600 000 a year would continue to have their tuition fee increases covered. \nHe called for arable land to be returned to blacks. It would be “difficult, if not impossible”, to achieve true reconciliation until the land question was resolved, he said. \nZuma would reply to the debate on Thursday.
