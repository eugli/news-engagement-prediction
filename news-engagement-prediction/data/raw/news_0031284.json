It wasn’t easy, it wasn’t one those runs were you hit three of four threes in row. It was just grind it out, grind it out. Get it down to manageable number. Got a couple of big stops and a great shot down the stretch.” Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Smith and Harris both went in the game at the 7:19 mark of the third quarter and never left the floor. \n“That unit obviously struggled, but the reason Reggie and Jon didn’t come back was not because they didn’t deserve another chance at it, even though they played bad,” Van Gundy said. “Tobias was playing really, really well and Ish was playing really, really well.” \nThe Pistons climbed back in the game with a 16-6 run to open the fourth quarter – a quarter where the Pistons would eventually outscore the Raptors, 36-19. The Pistons shot 62% in the fourth quarter. \nBut the Raptors (32-23) looked safe when Kyle Lowry’s lay-up with 1:23 left gave them a 101-96 lead. \nA Drummond free throw after an offensive rebound and a Caldwell-Pope jumper cut the deficit to two with 47 seconds remaining. \nAfter Lowry missed a short jumper, Smith rushed into the frontcourt with Van Gundy declining to get a time-out. \nSmith drove into the lane and then found Caldwell-Pope open in the corner. \nSwish! — Detroit Pistons (@DetroitPistons) February 13, 2017 \n“Just hope it goes in, that’s what I was thinking,” Caldwell-Pope said. “I know I had a rough night shooting the basketball from the field and three. \n“Every time I came out of the huddle, even at halftime, everybody was like, ‘Keep shooting, keep shooting.’ Don’t let it get me down. I kept shooting and it had to be the game-winning shot that I hit.” \nCaldwell-Pope finished with 21 points on 8-for-22 shooting. \n“I envy those guys, whether they’re missing or making, they have the confidence to take the next shot,” Smith said. “For me, when I miss a couple, I start thinking, ‘Alright, maybe this not a good shot.’ Those guys have supreme confidence.” \nSmith thought about taking the shot, but, with the Raptors discombobulated, saw Lowry was forced to guard two guys and made the pass to Caldwell-Pope. \n“Just make the right play and kick it to the guy in the corner,” Smith said. “Pope, he kept shooting with confidence. All his shots were looking good. I wasn’t worried about it. I was going to keep finding him. He hit the big one when it counted.” \nAfter a Raptors time-out, Morris had to face DeRozan one-on-one. \nDeRozan missed the shot just before the buzzer, and the Pistons have now won eight of their past 13 games.

Lowry finished 15 points, and Jonas Valanciunas added 17 points and nine rebounds for the Raptors. \nSimilar to the season opener against Toronto, Drummond picked up two early fouls. \nDeRozan started off hot, scoring 10 points in the first quarter to give the Raptors a 27-25 lead. \nThe Pistons' bench fueled an 11-5 run to start the second quarter and took a 37-32 lead. \nBut the Raptors surged the moment Van Gundy started bringing back starters. \nThe Raptors went on a 19-2 run to take a 51-39 lead. \nVan Gundy went back to Harris, Stanley Johnson (11 points), Smith and Aron Baynes and closed the half on a 6-0 run to cut the deficit to 51-45. \nThe Pistons' starters were still sluggish to start the second half, and the Pistons quickly found themselves down 16 midway through the third quarter. \nThe Raptors eventually took an 82-66 lead into the fourth quarter. \nContact Vince Ellis: vellis@freepress.com.
