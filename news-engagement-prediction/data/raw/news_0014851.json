Somehow, some way, Tom Brady and the Patriots erased a 25-point deficit to come away with a thrilling 34-28 overtime victory over the Falcons. \nHere are Sunday's 10 best Super Bowl performances, ranked from good to great. Copyright The Associated Press. All rights reserved. AP 10 Trey Flowers, DE, New England Patriots \nFlowers finished with 2.5 sacks, but none was bigger than the one he recorded with just under four minutes remaining in regulation. The Falcons were leading by eight points at the time and were closing in on a field goal attempt that could have sealed the game. The sack pushed Atlanta back to the New England 35-yard line, and Atlanta was called for holding on the next play. Richard Mackson Richard Mackson-USA TODAY Sports 9 Devonta Freeman, RB, Atlanta Falcons \nFreeman looked like he might be a difference-maker early on. He broke off a 37-yard run on Atlanta's first play from scrimmage and scored the game's first touchdown on a 5-yard run. He finished as the game's leading rusher, with 75 yards on 11 carries. Matthew Emmons USA TODAY Sports 8 Grady Jarrett, DT, Atlanta Falcons \nJarrett was able to bother Tom Brady consistently and recorded three of Atlanta's five sacks in the game. Bob Donnan USA TODAY Sports 7 Matt Ryan, QB, Atlanta Falcons \nRyan was almost perfect in Super Bowl LI against the Patriots. He finished 17-of-23 for 284 yards and two TDs, but he also fumbled while being sacked on a fourth-quarter drive that opened the door for New England's incredible comeback.

AP 6 Lady Gaga, Halftime \nThe halftime show was one of the better ones in recent memory, thanks to Lady Gaga's high-wire, high-energy performance . 5 Danny Amendola, WR, New England Patriots \nAmendola finished with eight catches for 78 yards and a touchdown and also fought his way into the end zone for the two-point conversion that tied the score at 28 with under a minute remaining in regulation. USA TODAY Sports Eric Seals-USA TODAY Sports 4 Julio Jones, WR, Atlanta Falcons \nJones made not one but two incredible sideline catches that seemed to defy the laws of physics. He was targeted only four times but caught all four of those passes to finish with 87 yards for the game. 3 Julian Edelman, WR, New England Patriots \nEdelman finished with five catches for 87 yards, but the insane circus catch he hauled in late in the fourth quarter will go down as one of the most memorable plays in Super Bowl history. Richard Mackson Richard Mackson-USA TODAY Sports 2 James White, RB, New England Patriots \nWhite was everything offensively for the Patriots in this one. He set Super Bowl records for most points scored (20) and most receptions (14) and finished with 139 total yards to go along with three TDs. Bob Donnan USA TODAY Sports 1 Tom Brady, QB, New England Patriots \nWas there any doubt? Brady set some records of his own in leading his team back from 25 points down late in the third quarter. He finished with the most completions (43) and the most passing yards (466) in a single Super Bowl, and calmly engineered drives that resulted in 31 straight points to give him a fifth championship and further cement his place among the game's all-time greats.
