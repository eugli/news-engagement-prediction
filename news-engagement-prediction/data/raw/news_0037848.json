When he came out, hood up and clad all in green, the announcers noted the bagpipes weren't playing him in as they usually did. It didn't bother his brethren in the stands, who stood with Irish flags draped around their necks and drowned out the ring announcer until Duddy had stripped down to his shorts, a golden shamrock embroidered on the left leg. \nIt was a fairly nondescript fight, with Duddy defeating Charles Howe by unanimous decision in 10 rounds, but for one 13-year-old holding up his phone to capture the Derry, Ireland native's entrance, it was a revelatory moment. Harley Burke, who had made the trek from New York to Boston with his father just to see Duddy, was realizing what he wanted to do with his life. \n\"I remember him walking in with this tough guy face on, he goes in and fights 10 rounds, and I remember thinking, 'that's the baddest guy on the planet, that's my hero right there,'\" Burke, who's fighting in his second Golden Gloves tournament, said Tuesday while looking at the ticket from that day, which he still covets almost nine years later. \"I always imagined having the crowd cheering me on. He wasn't the greatest fighter, but it was just that passion.\" \nDuddy was an appropriate role model for Burke, who comes from a large Irish family that has been supportive of his boxing career, despite not always believing he could make something out of the sport. \n\"I believe boxing is in my DNA,\" Burke said. \"I'm Irish, and we're a fighting people.\" \nThough it isn't really in his blood - Burke admitted nobody else in his family boxes - the 21-year-old does have a link to the sport that drives him. The father of his godmother was the late Gil Clancy, a boxing legend who trained Muhammad Ali, George Foreman and Emile Griffith. Burke only met Clancy once, shortly before the Hall of Fame trainer passed away in 2011, but the young boxer said it still made an impact. \n\"I had my first fight a few months before I met him, and that just motivated me further,\" Burke said. \"I wouldn't say it was destiny, but I think about how many aunts and uncles I have and it was (Clancy's daughter) who was chosen as my godmother. It was part of how I knew this is what I was meant to be doing.\" \nThe obsessive kid who used to steal his dad's car to drive to the South Bronx for sparring, who at 13 would pose as a radio host and cold call boxers just to talk their ear off about ring strategy, is now hearing the chants of his own name as he makes his way through the Golden Gloves tournament. Burke was the PC Richard & Son Boxer of the Night this past Saturday and is solely focused on winning his 165-lb Novice class. \n\"I printed out a picture of the Golden Gloves chain, and I keep it with me all the time - in my wallet, in the car, in my room,\" Burke said. \"I envision getting the Gloves draped around my neck every day. To me, it'd be like getting handed a college degree from Harvard.\" Join the Conversation:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:37:46.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
