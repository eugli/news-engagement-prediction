(Luke Broadwater) \n\"A lot of these programs are the only safe place our kids have,\" Cohen said. \"They're nurturing, they help people grow, and so to take that away has been devastating. I've been very disappointed that our governor has not stepped up to the plate. We, the city of Baltimore were promised a partnership, but yet here we are having to bake for our buses.\" \nA spokesman for Gov. Larry Hogan did not respond to a request for comment Thursday evening. Schools spokeswoman Edie House-Foster also did not respond to a request for comment. \nShe previously said that the district pays for MTA passes for students attending after-school activities in their schools but has not yet identified a funding source to buy passes for students who attend after-school activities in locations other than their schools.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:00:11.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
