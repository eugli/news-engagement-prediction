I get emails of starkas women all the time and Bill thinks I’m a creep because I go through them and I’m like ‘Oh my god they’re so gorgeous’,” the Perth-based internet sensation says of her role in the body confidence movement.\n“What’s wrong with having a wobbly stomach? I was fed up not being confident. Whether you’re comfortable with it or not I think it’s important to get it out there. I want our kids to see it; I want my sons to see normal figures.”\nmedia_camera Constance Hall is a woman on a mission to empower the masses. Picture: Patrick Schuttler\nHowever the fast-talking, self-titled Queen has learnt that not everyone shares her views. Assertive, extravert and somewhat confrontational, Hall is also deeply sensitive and suffers from anxiety due to constant trolling.\n“Is it a tall poppy thing?” she asks inquisitively, as she tries to work out why people can be so cruel.\n“In the beginning it was kind of cool to like me and then so many people liked me that it became cool not to like me. I’ve got a few coping mechanisms but if anyone could ever tell me how to take on board the positive and expel the negative I’d give them a million bucks – I’d give them my firstborn kid!”\nHaters gonna hate", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f673748cb9afff16ba2774d96b6c6049?width=650", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BPbodIEFk9A/embed", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/why-perth-blogger-queen-constance-reigns-supreme/news-story/f77dc0b42cc33b0595c77c4335e1919d"], "published": "2017-02-27T15:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T03:01:10.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
