Memes and social media posts also targeted O Paneerselvam, who resigned as chief minister on Sunday . For instance one tweet by @r_satishkumar, which got more than 100 retweets, likened OPS to a guy sitting on the ladies seat of an MTC bus, who had to get up whenever a woman came towards the seat. \n\nThe twitter handle @AdmkFails, which was at the forefront of taking on the party in the run-up to the 2016 assembly polls, actively put out tweets on Sunday evening. \n\nSupport for Sasikala was hard to come by on social media platforms, but a few, like a top television journalist, pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi too first became chief minister of Gujarat without winning an election. Another user stated that Tamil Nadu getting another woman chief minister was a positive trend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T14:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:16:24.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
