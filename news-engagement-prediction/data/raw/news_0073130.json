Both he and the high-level embassy official remained in Malaysia, he said.\n“He’s the second secretary of the embassy ... they’re not in custody, they’ve been called in for assistance,” Khalid told journalists at a press conference.\n“We knew there were attempts by someone to break into the hospital mortuary. We had to take precautions. We will not allow anyone to tamper with the mortuary,” the Malay Mail Quote: d him as saying.\nKim Jong-nam , who lived most of his life outside his home country, died from a seizure en route to hospital nine days ago after complaining that a woman had sprayed chemicals on his face at Kuala Lumpur international airport.\nMalaysian authorities have arrested four people : a Vietnamese woman, an Indonesian woman, a Malaysian man and a North Korean man.\nKhalid said police “strongly believed” four suspects who fled Malaysia on the day of Kim’s death had gone to the North Korean capital.\nThe detained Indonesian woman has said she was duped into playing a role in the killing , believing she was part of a television comedy prank.\nBut Khalid disputed that on Wednesday, saying the suspects were “trained” and had even practised the attack at different public places, including a major mall in downtown Kuala Lumpur.\n“Yes, the two female suspects knew that the substance they had were toxic. We don’t know what kind of chemical was used,” he said. Samples from an inconclusive autopsy were sent away for lab tests.\n“They used their bare hands,” he said, adding that they were instructed to wash their hands afterwards.\nThe killing has led to a diplomatic altercation between North Korea and Malaysia, which until now was one of the few countries keeping open diplomatic relations with Pyongyang.\nNorth Korea’s ambassador, Kang Chol, was summoned by the Malaysian foreign ministry on Monday after he accused police of deception.\nHe had demanded that no autopsy take place and the body be released immediately. Kuala Lumpur refused both requests so police could continue their investigation, and have called for a family member of Kim Jong-nam to come forward to claim the body.\nReuters contributed to this report\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.themalaymailonline.com/malaysia/article/cops-say-detected-bids-to-break-into-mortuary-holding-kim-jong-nam-body", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/14/kim-jong-un-half-brother-reportedly-killed-malaysia-north-korea", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/north-korea", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/17/suspect-north-korea-killing-thought-she-was-taking-part-in-tv-prank-indonesia-siti-aisyah-police-kim-jong-nam", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/16/kim-jong-nam-sword-damocles-half-brother-north-korean-heir-great-leader", "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/18/kim-jong-nam-killing-north-korean-man-arrested-as-second-autopsy-peformed", "http://www.theguardian.com/"], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:03:45.999+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
