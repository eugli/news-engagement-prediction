(David Cannon/Getty Images) \nIf this paragraph started with, “LOL! Yeah, right. Comfortable? Here?! LOL!,” you’d have understood. The Champion Course at PGA National is unforgiving. \nIt was the hardest par 70 in a non-major and boasted four of the PGA TOUR’s hardest 50 holes in each of the last two seasons. The kicker? None of those four are part of The Bear Trap (Nos. 15-17), which first captures the attention of all who enter. How can it not? There’s a plaque on a rock beside the tee at the par-3 15th stating the words of course redesigner Jack Nicklaus, “It should be won or lost right here.” \nThis is The Honda Classic. \nIf comfortable actually means being able to say that one poked the bear and survived, then so be it. In fact, the all-time earnings leader on the course is famously known for slaying another top-of-the-food chain predator – a Tiger; Woods, that is. A few months before Y.E. Yang stunned the 14-time major champion at the PGA Championship in 2009 – Yang remains the only Asian male to win a major and Woods has been winless in the majors since – the South Korean emerged victorious at PGA National for his breakthrough TOUR title. He added a runner-up finish here in 2011 and is 7-for-8 overall. TALES OF THE TAPE \nGolfers in this week’s field inside the top 10 in the following categories in last year’s Honda Classic: STAT T30 T45 \nSuccess here is almost entirely defined by course management and understanding how to take medicine. Experience hasn’t mattered as much as humility. Hitting greens in regulation doesn’t mean as much as escaping sans squares. All of this is embodied in the identifiers below. STROKES GAINED: APPROACH-THE-GREEN \nT9 Ryan Palmer (T10) T9 John Senden (T10) \nKeeping in line with relative fortune at PGA National, Horses for Courses is populated by guys who make the cut regularly and have even contended, but note that none are winners of The Honda Classic. Instead, as it concerns the long-term, the champions in the field could be accused more as beneficiaries of unpredictable great weeks of ball-striking and good luck more than unlocking any code. Perfectly struck shots can be deflected from the sky by random downdrafts and crossing gusts. Sometimes both. \nThe level of satisfaction of prevailing in this tournament has to feel like a career achievement, but from a pure X’s-and-O’s standpoint, the combination of reliable execution on approach and world-class short game is the most lucrative ticket. Bonus support goes to guys with experience in local weather/wind and ease putting on Bermudagrass. \nNOTE: Data below represents editions of The Honda Classic contested only at PGA National (2007-present).
