Ad Feedback \n\"The Bradford family have a long road ahead of them,\" Lance Bradford wrote on the campaign page. \n\"Brenton is left with little idea on life ahead financially as his current living and working arrangements is an impossible task for a single father of four children given his remote location and job requirements.\" \nThe funds raised will go towards funeral costs, bills, a new car, and care for the four children. - Brisbane Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:14:03.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
