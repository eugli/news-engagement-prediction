AFP PHOTO / DPA / CHRISTOPH SCHMIDT \nProduction delays mean Qatar Airways' state-of-the-art Airbus A350's aren't available for their world record Doha-Auckland service. \nQatar's new flight will also relegate Emirates' Dubai-Auckland flight to third place. \nREAD MORE: * Pilots endure long haul flying Unfortunately the first passengers on the new Doha-Auckland flights won't get Qatar's fancy new state-of-the-art Airbus A350's, instead they'll fly in on Boeing 777-200LR's. \nThe airline initially announced the Doha-Auckland service would start in December before delaying until February because of late delivery of the A350's. Airbus has more than 16,000 aircraft orders and a substantial backlog including the A350. The delay also means a reduction in Qatar Airways' services to Australia, as the airline offsets the delay by redeploying its existing fleet. istock \n\"Smile! You're in economy class for 18 hours.\" \nLong-haul travellers in for pitched battle \nBoasting about record long-distance flights is fine if you are travelling business class but for most passengers it's a cooped-up crush. \nQatar may have bested Emirates for the now longest-haul flight but Qatar's economy class passengers will have to endure more cramped seats than competitors. \nA quick trip to SeatGuru shows Emirates long-haul economy seats typically offer 81 to 86cm 'pitch', or leg room, while Qatar 's Boeing 777-200LR offers 76cm. Ad Feedback \nOn the plus side, if you're short and wide, Qatar economy boasts 48cm broad seats while Emirates gives passengers 43 to 45cm wide seats. \nAir New Zealand's 777-200ER falls somewhere between the two Middle Eastern giants providing 78 to 88cm wide economy seats. \nBuckle-in, you're stuck here for 18 hours - what to do? \nGood news economy flier! The average Hollywood blockbuster is now just over two hours long. That means you can shoehorn watching 11 movies into your 18-hour flight. \nToday's median book word-count is 64,000. An average reader can read five novels with minutes to spare before landing unfolding themselves from their economy class 'seat'. \nThose who fly away must come back, the combined 36-hour return trip should give you plenty of time to knit a Where's Wally? scarf. \nWhere's Wally?! He's in long-haul economy class.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T15:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T10:34:33.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
