So far it seems that way. Coming off of a game-changing collaboration with Louis Vuitton that was unveiled during the Paris menswear shows, the skate-and-so-much-more brand brought its signature blend of simplicity and bold red-and-white logo to the most practical accessory carried by every NYC resident: a MetroCard. \nAs one might expect, the team up between the cult-favorite brand and the MTA caused label loyalists to put the hype engine on full blast when they announced via Twitter that they would be dispensing limited edition branded MetroCards from vending machines at a selection of undisclosed New York City Subway stations. \nhttps://twitter.com/NYCTSubway/status/833698731430146050 \nAnyone with a rudimentary understanding of the cult of Supreme would gather, the menswear masses came out in full force in hopes of getting a rarified red card yesterday. Unsuspecting commuters and station agents found themselves at the center of the kinds of lines usually reserved for collection drops . Add to that a President's Day holiday and you've got a perfect storm of consumption that brought out high school students (who, admittedly would normally have to skip class to wait in line), some parents, and plenty of grown men and women hoping to land upon a lucky machine. Among the lines, ambitious teenagers set up shop re-selling other Supreme grails while waiting for machines to spit out the red, white, and black cards. \nThe genius of the exercise, like most of Supreme's seemingly-simple ideas, was that regular people ended up winning the hypebeast lottery on their way to work and streetwear fanatics spent a balmy day hanging out in urine-scented and rat-infested subway stations. Never has public transportation been so lit. Last we checked the cards were selling online for anywhere from $50 to $130â€”a sweet profit margin on the $5.50 paid for each card. With yesterday's spike in MetroCard sales, we're hoping the MTA puts that extra money to good use.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:54:05.939+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
