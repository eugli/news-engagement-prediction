'She did not argue and accepted the doctor's advice to take Briony home and keep up the fluids and medications, including the prednisolone,' the coroner said. A day later, Briony was taken to Dr Heinrich, who gave her antibiotics and believed she had glandular fever. Coroner Mark Johns said the GP, Christopher Heinrich (pictured), had failed to take appropriate notes when he was told about 'extremely important' blood test results Briony Klingberg died of multiple organ failure two years ago in Adelaide's Women's and Children's Hospital (pictured) Ms Klingberg and her husband took Briony home and were told to await blood test results. The inquest heard that the blood test results were found to be 'odd', so Dr Heinrich phoned the parents and told them to take Briony back to the Women's and Children's Hospital. They rushed her to the hospital but she collapsed in the car park outside the emergency department before being taken to intensive care, where she died the next day. After her death, it was found that she had died from necrosis caused by a herpes infection. THE HERPES VIRUS More than 3.7 billion people under the age of 50 suffer from the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which causes cold sores around the mouth. The virus may lie dormant for years and the recurrence of sores triggered by a virus, hormonal changes, stress, fatigue or changes in the immune system. Currently, there is no cure for the virus. Most people contract HSV-1 in childhood, through skin-to-skin contact with an infected adult. It is transmitted through secretions or sores on the skin and can be spread through touching, kissing, or sharing objects such as razors, towels, toothbrushes or cutlery. Another 417 million people aged 17 to 49 have the other form of the disease, HSV-2, which is associated with causing sores around the genitals. The coroner said Dr Christopher Say, the senior doctor at Mount Barker Hospital, admitted he should have noticed her herpes infection. But Mr Johns did not blame Dr Say, and said he had been 'caring and conscientious' and was 'clearly very distressed about Briony's tragic death'. However, Mr Johns did criticise Dr Heinrich, who he said should have taken better notes - although noted that the GP probably could not have saved the girl's life. The coroner said: 'Dr Heinrich admitted that as he was taking the telephone calls reporting the blood results he was at his home doing some gardening. 'He admitted that he did not write down what he was being told nor did he elect to go to his rooms to obtain a hard copy of them despite the fact that they were being faxed there.' 'He failed to take proper notes, he failed to take observations of Briony during the consultation. 'His evidence in the witness box to the effect that taking and recording observations for a child that was as obviously sick as Briony would be tantamount to shifting the chairs on the Titanic is not consistent with his decision to send her home with her mother immediately after the consultation. 'Certainly it is not consistent with his later failure to tell the mother immediately on receiving the blood results that Briony should be conveyed to the Women’s and Children’s Hospital immediately. 'In saying these things I acknowledge the evidence that by then it would in all likelihood have been too late to save Briony’s life.' The coroner said 'no single medical professional' could have noticed Briony's deterioration and urged parents to see the same doctor when their children are ill. He also made it clear that Briony's parents were not to blame for her death in any way.
