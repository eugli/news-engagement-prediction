(Sure, I'll feign enthusiasm for sports if chicken fingers are involved. Who wouldn't?) Thankfully, the Super Bowl has enough razzle dazzle to sort of make me forget that I'm watching a sporting event. And this year, there's the halftime show that Lady Gaga is headlining —which you know is going to be crazy. (For the love of pop, Gaga, please bring out Beyoncé for \"Telephone!\" My 16-year-old homosexual self would die .) \nBut if Gaga isn't your jam—A.K.A. you're a monster and not the little kind—the Super Bowl commercials are always fun and star-studded. And this year's crop of ads is no exception. From Melissa McCarthy to Miranda Kerr, all of your faves showed up and showed out for the Super Bowl. These Super Bowl ads, hands down, are the best of the bunch. Take a look. \nTiffany & Co. \nGaga took some time out from rehearsing her halftime set to film this spot for Tiffany & Co. The black & white ad features a relaxed, barefaced Gaga talking about creativity and challenging the status quo. \"I love to change,\" Gaga says in the commercial. \"It's pretentious to talk about how creative you are.\" Bravo! Oscar! Pulitzer! \nWix \nIRL Wonder Woman Gal Gadot and my boyfriend Jason Statham fight bad guys in the name of good website design. I don't think HTML is ready for this jelly. \nMr. Clean \nI've had a crush on Mr. Clean since I was 6 years old. This add legitimizes my thirst—and (don't lie) yours, too. \nKia \nMelissa McCarthy saves whales, trees, and rhinos in this slapstick-heavy spot for Kia. All in a day's work, I guess. \nBuick \nCam Newton and Miranda Kerr show up out of thin air after two dads disagree that some fancy new convertible is actually—gasp!—a Buick. I've never been more interested in cars. \nSquarespace \nAll hell breaks loose when John Malkovich tries to buy the domain name JohnMalkovich.com, and it's already taken . By who?! Who the heck else is John Malkovich. Watch this commercial to find out. Hint: It involves fish. (???) \nAudi \nAudi declares its commitment to closing the wage gap in this deeply moving commercial, which shows a father wrestling with how to explain gender inequality to his young daughter. This wins all the awards. \nBudweiser \nFor this year's Super Bowl ad, the beer giant decided to tackle Trump's widely-criticized immigration ban. It depicts a young German man facing animosity and discrimination as he immigrates to America. That man, we find out, is one of the founders of Anheuser-Busch: Adolphus Busch. Add \"good beer\" to this list of things we need to thank immigrants for. \nT-Mobile \nJustin Bieber, Rob Gronkowski, and Terrell Owens dance their butts off for the sake of good cell phone coverage. (The best reason to spontaneously start dancing, IMHO.) \nIntel \nIf you've ever wanted to watch Tom Brady brush his teeth in slow motion, this commercial is for you. \nHulu \nThis is literally just a spot for Hulu's new show, The Handmaid's Tale , and I'm 100 percent OK with it. ( Alexis Bledel!!! ) \n84 Lumber \nThe building materials supply company depicts a Mexican mother and her daughter attempting to cross the American border. 84 Lumber's original, more controversial commercial (which included a giant wall) was rejected by Fox , but will be posted to the company's website after the game. \nHonda \nHonda released a 14-second teaser for its Super Bowl commercial, which features Steve Carell talking inside his high school yearbook photo. Sold. \nLexus \nLil Buck defies gravity in this spot for Lexus, which is voiced over by Speechless star Minnie Driver .
