The mogul, who made a fortune selling Russian gas to the Ukrainian government, denies the US allegations.\nHe was indicted in Chicago by a US grand jury in 2012 for allegedly paying millions of dollars in bribes to Indian officials through US banks in a failed attempt to secure titanium mining rights in India.\nArrested a year later in Vienna, Firtash posted bail of €125m (more than £106m) shortly afterwards, leaving him free but unable to leave Austria .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:58:00.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
