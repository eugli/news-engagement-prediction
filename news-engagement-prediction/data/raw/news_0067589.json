Audio: WA Election: Dam and irrigation debate in the Kimberley (ABC News) \nDuring the middle of one of the biggest wet seasons on record and at a time when a number of cattle stations are looking to start irrigation projects , is this a policy that will hold water and win votes? \nLabor candidate for the Kimberley, Josie Farrer, said Indigenous communities and traditional owners had growing concerns about dams and irrigation projects in the region. \n\"I'm opposed to damming the Margaret River which flows into the Fitzroy [River],\" she said. \n\"I think there has not been enough study done in regards to the species of fish that live in the Fitzroy and up along the Margaret [River]. \n\"Once it's destroyed you'll never replace a lot of those things, so this is the concern that a lot of us have, when we hear about places like the Margaret River wanting to be dammed. \n\"We have to understand that this whole estuary system begins from some other people's country and this is where proper consultation needs to happen. That's the proper way of doing things with Indigenous people.\" \nMs Farrer said Dimond Gorge, which over the years has been a proposed dam site, was a significant area for Indigenous culture and where different tribes used to meet. \nShe said even for small irrigation projects, better consultation was needed between traditional owners and cattle producers.

(Supplied: WA Labor) Liberal: National Park and complete dam ban could be detrimental \nLiberal candidate for the seat of Kimberley, Warren Greatorex, said his party wanted to work with pastoralists who were keen to start irrigation projects, but any dam proposal would need a proper consultation process. \n\"The damming of the Fitzroy Valley is very contentious and has been for some years,\" he said. \n\"It shouldn't be a detriment to our economy if there are opportunities there to irrigate parts of the Fitzroy. \n\"I'm all for protecting country, but at the same time we should not negate any opportunities that could lead to any economic development, which in turn will help some of our social problems throughout the Kimberley which is on the increase. \n\"Whether or not the whole Fitzroy Valley area should be made a national park, I think it needs a lot more thought behind it, and not to put a 100 per cent ban on any economic opportunities that may come out of it.\" Greens: Opportunity for small scale irrigation, but definitely no dams \nGreens candidate for the Kimberley, Liz Vaughan, believes firmly in protecting the Fitzroy River and making sure it is never dammed. \nShe said creating a national park was a good idea, but did not necessarily give it absolute protection. \n\"We do see that national parks aren't always really good protection for these areas,\" she said. \n\"The current Government has allowed mining tenements in some of our best-loved national parks like Windjana and Tunnel Creek.\" \nMs Vaughan said the growing number of pastoralists looking to start centre pivot irrigation projects in the Kimberley was something her party would support. \n\"Smaller scale irrigation can work and can be assessed on a case-by-case basis to see how that affects the environment and culture,\" she said. \n\"Large scale irrigation is not something we'd support because the environmental implications are too large. \n\"Of course you always want to go by the science, to have a good investigation and go by the science, so I'd welcome an environmental assessment [on large scale projects].\" Nationals: Labor's Fitzroy plan risks scaring off investment \nNationals candidate for the Kimberley, Rob Houston, said he would not support a dam on the Fitzroy River, but argued Labor's approach could scare investors off a number of exciting irrigation projects emerging in the Fitzroy Valley. External Link: Kimberley rivers \n\"My concern is at the moment you've got a lot of money being invested in agriculture through the Water for Food project,\" he said. \n\"And a number of Indigenous groups [are] working in partnership with pastoralists to look at how agriculture projects could create economic opportunities in the Fitzroy Valley. \n\"My concern is that this sort of rhetoric [by Labor] basically scares investment off.\" \nMr Houston said the WA Government had been clear that it was not interested in damming any rivers in the Kimberley. \n\"It's been made very clear throughout the Water for Food project that most of the approach is looking at groundwater, and a number of traditional owner groups who are very supportive. \n\"So I would have thought WA Labor should be getting behind those groups and looking at how we can create sustainable economic development in the region. \n\"There's definitely areas in the Kimberley which should be protected and managed for their environmental and cultural values, but there's also areas that I think we should look at the opportunities for development and how we can create a sustainable and diversified economy.\" One Nation: Dams could create jobs and economic growth \nOne Nation candidate for the Kimberley, Keith Wright, said he was concerned about the \"ever-increasing push\" to create national parks, and described Labor's plan as \"a backwards move\". \n\"To see the hundreds and thousands of litres of water [from the Fitzroy River] going to waste, when it could be utilised in the future for some useful purpose, [like] growing food and providing jobs,\" he said. \n\"We need to employ as many people as possible and if we can have another dam — Lake Argyle is a huge asset to the nation — if we can have another dam on the Margaret [River] or somewhere on the Fitzroy, I think it would allow an awful lot of projects to get underway.\" Are there any plans to build a dam? \nA policy to protect the Fitzroy Valley from dams holds little water if there is no-one even proposing a dam. \nHowever, according to conservation group Environs Kimberley, there is a renewed bid by the company KIMCO to build dams on the Margaret River (1.2 million megalitres) and Dimond Gorge (11.5 million megalitres), for the purpose of irrigating up to 350,000 hectares of crops such as grain and cotton. \nA proposal to dam the Margaret has also featured in the recent Regional Development Australia's publication The Mid and North Western Australia Investment Portfolio . \n\"With new proposals for dams and mass irrigation gaining momentum, this policy [by Labor] commits to protecting the Fitzroy, which is one of Australia's greatest rivers,\" said Environs Kimberley director Martin Pritchard. \nABC Rural has been unable to contact KIMCO for comment and understands there is no detailed dam proposal under consideration by government. \nOver the past five years, the CSIRO has identified 70 crops that could grow in the north and 16 million hectares of land that is suitable for irrigated agriculture .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T00:18:38.190+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
