But he worked his tail off to get to the front in the closing laps. Ryan Blaney (21) crosses the finish line right behind Kurt Busch, placing second in Sunday’s 59th annual Daytona 500.

Luckily we had the No. 22 (Logano) with us. I kind of helped him and he kind of helped me.” \n“I got to second behind the 41 somehow and that kept us going the whole way,” he added. \nAn incident in the Can-Am Duel qualifying race forced the No. 21 team to pull out a backup car for the 500, making the runner-up finish even more impressive. \n“It was a solid race,” Blaney said. “It was such a fast Ford. For (it) to be a backup car, that really means a lot for Ford and Motorcraft. Not what we wanted but a pretty good run and start to the season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:07:00.201+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
