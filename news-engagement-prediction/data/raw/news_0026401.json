But that’s about to change. \nIn the premiere of his fourth season, the host of HBO’s “Last Week Tonight” announced Sunday night that he had made TV ads aimed at educating the president — and that those ads would air Monday morning on MSNBC, CNN, and Fox News. Advertisement \nThe announcement came after Oliver spent the better part of his show skewering Trump, denouncing his statements as lies, and describing the president’s news sources as “frighteningly unreliable.” \n“There is one small way we wanted to try and sneak some useful facts into his media diet,” Oliver said in the show that aired Sunday night. “As we now know, he watches morning cable news for information. So we’ve created a series of commercials in an attempt to bring him up to speed on information he may lack.” Get The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond.

Tiffany.” \nOliver, also known for spurring hashtags that go wild on social media, created another one Sunday while talking about Trump’s perception of reality. \n“Republicans should badly want our sense of objective reality to remain intact just in case the Democrats ever find their own appealing reality star to win back the White House — RuPaul, for instance,” Oliver said. “Make America fierce again, hashtag, #makeamericafierceagain.” \nDespite the humor, Oliver had a serious message to deliver: That Americans should be cautious of taking Trump’s statements as facts, and stressed the importance of weeding out “fake” news from fact-checked stories. \n“Trump was telling the truth about his solutions to the problems he was lying about, and he is now making real policy based on fake facts,” Oliver said.
