Read more Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp are all selling you to be able to sell to you \nStatus can now be posted using the in-app camera. A user can take a photo or video and overlay it with text, sketches or emojis, or all of them. \nThe status update can be viewed for 24 hours after which, like in Snapchat, it will automatically expire. \nAnother Snapchat-like feature is the “seen by” counter. \nThis is not the first time a Facebook property has cloned a Snapchat “stories” feature. Instagram did it in August, a month later Facebook Messenger did some copying, too. And in January, Facebook added the “stories” feature, which is being beta tested and available to limited users. Ditto for Facebook Messenger. \nThe addition of this feature on WhatsApp appears to represent a shift – it will for the first time allow users to scroll through content shared publically by their contacts. \nWhatsApp, the world’s largest messaging app, till now has been a direct messaging platform. \nA report on Forbes suggested it may be an attempt by Facebook to monetise WhatsApp. \nRead | WhatsApp may soon allow you to reply to status messages, mute them \n“Status will change that use case for the first time. It also potentially opens the door to messages from businesses, or rather, advertisers. WhatsApp said more than a year ago that it was looking at ways that businesses could send messages to its users in an unobtrusive and useful way,” the report said on Tuesday. \n“Facebook has been able to rake billions in revenue each quarter from advertisers precisely because it can insert their videos and photos into its content-heavy Newsfeed,” the report added. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T16:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:13:03.108+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
