Both 31-year-old Song and 24-year-old Park are under the same entertainment agency, Blossom Entertainment. They are collectively known as the “Blossom brothers”, thanks to their close friendship and boyish good looks. Song also made special appearances at Park’s fan meetings in Taiwan (22 Jan) and Thailand (11 Feb). The duo put on a strong show of bromance as they played games with fans and displayed their chemistry by matching their answers in a telepathy game. Even before the older actor appeared on stage, Park held his own during the three-hour-long fan meeting. He sang songs from the two popular dramas he starred in, “Love In The Moonlight” and “Reply 1988”, and also belted a local children’s song “Singapura, Oh, Singapura”. At the emcee’s encouragement, Park also tried his hand at speaking a random Hokkien phrase, “if I had a million dollars”, and ate local dishes roti prata and carrot cake on stage. And if you’re wondering if he prefers black or white carrot cake, it’s the latter (dipped into roti prata curry). Who knows, that might be the next big thing in the hawker centres. Unique food pairings aside, Park dished out heaps of fan service during games with his fans. Several fans were selected to go up on stage and re-enact their favourite scenes with Park from his dramas, “Love In The Moonlight” and “Reply 1988”. However, one fan accidentally left Park’s handshake hanging as she turned to leave the stage, but the actor took it in his stride. The 24-year-old rising star embarked on his first Asia fan meet tour on 10 Dec in Malaysia and completed it with one last stop in Singapore, which was also his first time meeting his fans here. Closing out the night’s event and his Asia tour as well, Park read out a hand-written message to the fans. “It’s been an incredible journey filled with happiness and gratitude because I got to meet many supportive fans who come from both near and far. I hope all of us continue to keep in mind that every choice we make defines our lives, and that we make every day a happy day. Thank you so much for being a part of this wonderful experience. God bless all of you,” Park said.
