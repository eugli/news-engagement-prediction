And Tim Tebow has an unhealthy love for guacamole. Long Story \nIf we need to tell you that Mia Khalifa used to be one of THE biggest names in porn, we have a problem. But there’s no time to address it now because the XXX superstar turned Queen Troll (who most recently spoke out about the inauguration ) and Boob Educator (here’s why having big breast sucks , in case you were wondering) has unleashed her wrath on Tim Tebow and it’s glorious. \nHe may be an NFL great and one of the New York Mets’ most talked about new players , but Mia Khalifa couldn’t be less impressed by any of that because, well, homie doesn’t know how to eat guacamole. When For The Win sports writer Steven Ruiz posted a photo of Tim \"sitting around eating guacamole straight out of a container\", it immediately raised all the Internet eyebrows.

She wasn't exactly into it...

You know, sort of like Ghostbusters, but way hotter. Own The Conversation \nBut seriously: WTF is Tim Tebow doing? Disrupt Your Feed \nESPN, please hire Mia Khalifa as a sports commentator. Drop This Fact \nMia previously trolled Ole Miss quarterback Chad Kelly like there was no tomorrow.
