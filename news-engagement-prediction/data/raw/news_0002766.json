It resonated in a week where the US president’s \"Muslim Ban\" has caused so much division, where turning vulnerable people away has rightly elicited protests worldwide.\nPrince Charles highlighted the importance of reaching \"across the boundaries of faith and community; to extend a helping hand wherever one might be needed.\" This message is relevant for all of us, no less so for Muslims in the West who are on high alert following the terrorist attack against a Canadian mosque that killed six people. It comes amid an already hostile atmosphere against Muslims where we are seen as different, alien and not part of this country.\nIn this poisonous atmosphere of fear and distrust it would be understandable for Muslims to hunker down and turn in on themselves just to survive. But that would be giving in to the bigots. Instead we Muslims should remind ourselves that we are at our best when we reach out, share our faith and welcome fellow citizens into our home.\nThat is why this Sunday over 150 mosques around the country are participating in Visit My Mosque day. For the third consecutive year, mosques will be welcoming in their neighbours for tea, biscuits, and an opportunity to build bridges and talk about their faith beyond the negative headlines.\nWatch | Donald Trump: 'I want surveillance of certain mosques' 01:06 U nlike Trump’s immigration ban, Visit My Mosque day does not discriminate your entry based on your religion. Men, women and children of all faiths and none will be welcome.\nSome may worry about what to do at mosques, whether women have equal access, or question certain practices in our faith. These are all valid concerns, but we hope the great British public will use the opportunity to come visit their local mosque and put these questions to their Muslim neighbours.\nIn previous years we were struck by how the great British public took to Visit My Mosque Day. Visitors from remote parts of the country where there were no mosques drove dozens of miles to visit mosques in Aberdeen and Bristol after hearing about it on national radio. While mosques in Cambridge and Wolverhampton that were unaware of the campaign, reported that neighbours were knocking on their doors asking if they could come inside.\nWatch | Barack Obama makes first visit to a mosque as US president 02:18 A nd Muslims too have been enthusiastic to invite their neighbours to share their story. A mosque is a place of worship for those practicing the Islamic faith, where five daily congregational prayers are held, led by an imam (prayer leader). The first mosque on our Isles is said to have been established in Liverpool in 1887 by the Englishman Abdullah Quilliam. He intended it not only for it to be a place of worship and a spiritual focal point, but also active in serving their local communities, regardless of faith or background.\nToday many mosques strive to live up to that great British and Islamic tradition. Many mosques serve their localities and help people of all faiths and none by running food banks, feed-the-homeless projects, neighbourhood street cleans, local fundraising and much more. For example, Khizra Mosque in Manchester runs a monthly food collection to support up to seven local families, while mosques in Leicester recently fundraised £20,000 in just three weeks for a new scanner at Glenfield Hospital, and worshippers at the East London Mosque donated 10 tonnes of food for the homeless last Christmas.\nDonald Trump’s vision says Islam and Western nations are incompatible. Over 150 mosques this Sunday 5 February opening their doors on Visit My Mosque day, says otherwise.\nHarun Khan is Secretary-General of the Muslim Council of Britain.
