Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nKaren Matthews has told how she fears for her life after the screening of a drama about the shocking fake kidnap of daughter Shannon . \nThe petrified mum-of-seven was bombarded by death threats as the first of BBC two-parter The Moorside was aired on Tuesday night and watched by seven million people. \nBut Matthews, 40, is still protesting her innocence over the heartless kidnap plot of nine-year-old Shannon and insisted the full truth will be revealed. \nShe told a pal: “I cannot go out of the door. I’m frightened out of my life. I’m shaking like a leaf. I’m s*** scared to even get any ­shopping or anything. \n“I know I can’t stop it but why does it have to be dragged up again? Why don’t they just leave me alone and let me get on with my life?

I’m too scared to go anywhere. I feel isolated. If I could go back I would ask the police to ­reinvestigate everything… the truth’s going to come out.” \nAfter the screening of The Moorside, which starred Gemma Whelan as the kidnap mum and Sheridan Smith plays her best mate Julie Bushby, viewers laid into Matthews on social media – even though she paid her punishment for the 2008 crime with a jail sentence. \nThe sick death threats included one from a viewer called Andy who posted: “The evil cow wants putting to sleep.” Another added: “Absolutely disgusting that Karen Matthews has been given a new identity.” Supporters and family members of missing nine year old Shannon Matthews (Photo: PA) \nFormer model Jodie Marsh wrote: “I’d go as far as to say that it’s people like Karen Matthews who make me think we should all be sterilised from birth then vetted to have kids.” \nAnd another viewer added: “If Donald Trump checks Twitter tonight, he’ll find someone more unpopular than him. Karen Matthews.” \nMatthews claimed she has been attacked in the street since being released from prison, where she served half of a four-year sentence for the kidnap plot which was believed to have been carried out in a cynical bid to get reward money.
