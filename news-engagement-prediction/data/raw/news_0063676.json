The scuffle was triggered when a Congress MLA Paresh Dhanani asked about reasons for farmers' suicide in Amreli district. \nThe question prompted heated arguments between members which eventually led to scuffle and body blows. Senior Congress MLA Shaktisinh Gohil termed the incident as \"black day\" for democracy and accused the ruling party members of attacking the opposition members. \nAfter the House was reconvened, Speaker Vora suspended two Congress MLAs for starting the clashes. \nMeanwhile, Baldevji Thakor, who received injury in his leg, said he would file a police complaint against BJP MLAs for attack on him inside the assembly.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:50:42.649+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
