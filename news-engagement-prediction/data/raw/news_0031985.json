Editor Advertisement \nPolice have arrested a car passenger this early this morning for drug-related offences. The arrest came as the car the man was in evaded a police road block along Kallang Way. However, the car driver was not arrested. \nHow strange. Pretty sure the driver was the one who evaded the road block, not the passenger. Arrest the passenger for drug offences, no question, but driver let free? Unless he was forced to evade the road block by the passenger, then he should be arrested too, right? But if he was forced to evade by the passenger, than the passenger in a shit load of trouble. Already drug offences is terrible enough, to force someone to evade road block? \nMaybe Police should come out and clarify why driver not arrested. \nMichael \nA.S.S.
