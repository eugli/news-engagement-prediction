When he went to Manchester he married England. And he had such a strong, strong relationship with Sir Alex Ferguson. Ferguson was like his father.”\nGaltier is the father of AS Saint-Étienne . He has been coach of the evocative French club, Les Verts , since 2009 and he will lead them into Thursday’s Europa League last-32 tie against United with a passionate, paternal intensity. The 50-year-old is one of the most charismatic, warm – and funny – managers in European football and he is also Cantona’s oldest friend.\nGaltier even played in his friend’s last match at Old Trafford – the testimonial for the relatives of the Munich air disaster victims in 1998 . “There were French flags on the streets, on the houses, on the balconies,” Galtier says “The stadium was full and they sang La Marseillaise and it was a big, big thing for him.”\nThe two grew up together in Marseille. They went to school together. They studied and played and dreamt together and they played football together for their first club, Les Caillois. They also played for the France Under-21 team together – winning the European Championship in 1988.\n“Eric? Ah, it was our story, the two years we played together for the Under-21s and we won the title,” Galtier says. “I remember the game we played in England [semi-final]. It was at Arsenal, at Highbury, 2-2. And it was an unbelievable game. Oh, the spirit. There was Paul Gascoigne playing for England and I remember man-to-man Eric and Paul Gascoigne on the pitch. Ah, big, big characters.”\nCantona returned to Old Trafford for the last time to play in 1998, a year after his retirement, for the Munich air disaster testimonial Credit: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images G altier sees similarities between Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Cantona . “When I look at Ibra I think of Eric Cantona,” he says, but he is also a big, big character. They say in Saint-Étienne that the day he leaves, the club will never be the same. And it is easy to see why. Listen, for example, to Galtier talk about what it means to be in charge of Saint-Étienne, the most English of French clubs.\n“There is nowhere else in France like this,” he says, emphasising almost every word. “This is like England. Maybe Marseille. But Marseille is like Italy. I am from Marseille and it’s like southern Italy, Napoli! And Saint-Étienne is similar to Liverpool. Small city; it’s not rich. But one thing is different – Saint-Étienne is the only team in this city - and the colour. It is called by the colour. Les Verts. The Greens. Marseille, Paris, Monaco, Nantes. Not a colour. Here – Saint-Étienne: the Greens. Liverpool: the Reds. You understand?\n\"The stadium here is like an English stadium, also. Here – only the football is important. And like, I think in England, the families are all fans – grandfather, father, son. You give back. And when I speak with my wife, and she asks me the same ‘Why you stay here?’ - and she’s happy, by the way - but I say: 'It’s like in England.'”\nMUFC greatest XI G altier has worked in England and may do so again. He was Alain Perrin’s assistant at Portsmouth in 2005. In fact his last match in English football was also at Old Trafford with Perrin sacked, Joe Jordan in caretaker charge and Portsmouth facing United on the day of George Best’s funeral.\n“It was very, very emotional,” Galtier says. “But it was also, after that, a bad moment for me because I love the Premier League and I then left. Harry Redknapp was coming back and he wanted his own staff. But I loved - and love - the Premier League.\n“It’s a small country but there are a lot of derbies. I remember Portsmouth v Southampton. Woof! I can imagine Liverpool v Everton; Man U v City; Arsenal v Tottenham. That’s why I love it. It’s Saint-Étienne v Lyon. It’s not a game like any other. It’s not a normal game. It’s tough, hard. It goes beyond football. It’s like your honour. In England there is money but it’s not about the money, you know?”\nSaint-Etienne defeated Lorient 4-0 at the weekend and moved up to fifth in Ligue 1 Credit: PHILIPPE DESMAZES/ AFP W e do know. But it is also why Galtier turned down Aston Villa in October 2015. They came calling but: “it’s not a regret that I didn’t go”. Galtier speaks excellent English although, for this answer, he talks precisely in French so there is no confusion.\n“It was not because it was a bad season for Aston Villa,” he says. “It was because it was during the season. After I spoke to Aston Villa I was attracted to go to England. But I did not want to leave during the season and leave the club here in difficulty. I respected that and it was the right thing to do. It was impossible for me to leave.\n“A lot of people think it is my objective to go to England but not especially. I love, love, love the Premier League but I am not focused on that. But if I could choose – Italy, Spain, Germany, England, it would be England. I was so disappointed to only be there for six months [at Portsmouth]. I had a taste of it and, yes, I want to go back. Why not?”\nGaltier took over at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in 2009 Credit: Getty Images G altier has performed a minor miracle at Saint-Étienne. “Season after season we progress. I don’t know the limit,” he says. He was the sixth coach in five years when he arrived, saving them from relegation. Each season they have climbed the table, now consistently qualifying for Europe on a modest budget and even pushing to make it into the Champions League, and in 2013 they lifted the Coupe de la Ligue, the first trophy in 32 years.\nNow it is United. One unusual aspect of the tie is that Paul Pogba will face his older brother, Florentin, the Saint-Étienne defender. “We speak about this game and I know for the family it’s an important game,” Galtier says before adding mischievously: “It’s an African family [the sons are French-born from Guinean parents], you know. And one thing is important. Paul is the youngest. He has to give the respect to his older brother! But man-to-man it’s not a problem for Flo to play against his brother. He wants to kill him! I think it will only be difficult for their mother!”\nChristophe Galtier was assistant manager of Lyon at Old Trafford in 2008 when Manchester United knocked them out of the round of 16 en route to winning the European Cup for the third time Credit: Chris Coleman/Man Utd via Getty Images H e believes United are a formidable proposition. “For me, Manchester United is the biggest club in the world,” Galtier says. “It’s like a mountain. Mont Blanc. Himalayas. Big, big gap between Manchester and us. But I have my plan. Our objective is to still have hope for the game here [the second leg].\n“They will want to make the difference in the first game. They will want to finish it. I watch many games. It was difficult for them at the beginning of the season but now they are a strong team, a strong team physically as well, big, with a big organisation. As always with Mourinho. And Ibra is Ibra.”\nAh, Ibrahimovic. “He’s a good guy,” Galtier says before launching into a passionate appraisal of the striker. “As with Jose Mourinho he is different from the image. He has a big, big, big, big, massive personality. But every time I met him there was mutual respect. We played a lot against PSG and in the beginning we won but after Ibra arrived – it was blah, blah, blah … goal, goal, goal.\nFlorentin Pogba comes up against his younger brother Paul at Old Trafford Credit: ROMAIN LAFABREGUE/AFP “I love those kind of players. They are strong. Very strong. When I look at Ibra I think of Eric Cantona. Big personality. He can get mad in one second, say big things, and then, ‘OK, I said it.' But, above all, an incredible player. And he scores. Goals, goals, goals. Lots of people said he would find it difficult in England but, already, 20 goals.\n“He is a great professional. He sets an example. I think that’s why they brought him to Manchester. Like Cantona. I have some friends in Paris and they told me all the time: ‘If you give the ball here rather than there he will kill you.' But that’s important to the young players. Even after the training session he [Ibrahimovic] stayed in the gym for another hour and the young players they see this and they go there also. He’s like that at 35 because he’s always been like this.”\nG altier is the same. “Ah, yes,” he says, laughing. “This, football, is my drug. Two drugs. Football and my family.”\nTwo families also - his own and Saint-Étienne.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T12:26:27.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
