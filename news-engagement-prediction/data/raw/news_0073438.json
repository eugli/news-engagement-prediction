The State of Arizona offers tax credits in certain situations allowing some Arizonans to make contributions to schools and non-profit organizations, and then receive that money as a direct credit (not just a deduction) at the time income taxes are filed. These tax credits are for individuals, not businesses. Here are the basics. 1 - Qualifying Charitable Organizations Contributions \nBeginning in the 2013 tax year: you do not have to itemize deductions to claim a credit for contributions to a Qualifying Charitable Organization or Qualifying Foster Care Charitable Organization \nTaxpayers filing as “single” and “head of household” and “married filing separate” may claim a maximum credit of $400. Taxpayers that file as “married filing joint” may claim a maximum credit of $800. \nStill, you can't just pick any non-profit organization. \ncontinue reading below our video Best Ride Sharing Apps of 2015 To qualify for this tax credit, a charity to which you would contribute must provide assistance to residents of Arizona who either receive Temporary Assistance of Needy Families benefits, are low-income residents of Arizona, or are chronically ill or physically disabled children. Some organizations that serve foster children might also qualify. You don't have to find that out for yourself; each charity knows if they qualify for the tax credit. Most of them will indicate this on their website if they are. The organization may also have a form for this contribution or an online payment system. You can often find the annual report online to take a look at how the money at that organization is spent. Even if the charity's website doesn't have the information, you can call them to get it. The important issue here is that for you to receive the tax credit, the organization must be able to provide a copy of the certification letter from the Arizona Department of Revenue. Once you know that the organization you support is certified, then you can make the contribution and take your Arizona tax credit when you file your tax return. You'll need Form 321. You must also total your nonrefundable individual income tax credits on Form 301. \nNew in 2016: credit eligible contributions that are made on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year (April 15, in most cases) may be applied to either the current or the preceding taxable year. \nIf you don't have time to check out all the individual organizations that might qualify, and you don't have a favorite qualifying charity in mind, there are umbrella organizations, like United Way, where you can donate the money and they will distribute it. \nRead the complete and official information about the Arizona Department of Revenue Charitable Tax Credit . \nTip : You don't have to donate to the charity all in one lump sum. If you donated to the same organization several times throughout the year, you can total those qualified donations up, up to the maximum $200/yr (single) or $400/yr (married filing jointly) to qualify for the Arizona tax credit. 2 - Qualifying Foster Care Charitable Contributions \nBeginning in the 2013 tax year: Arizona taxpayers may receive a credit on their Arizona income tax for donations made to a Qualifying Foster Care Charitable Organization. The organization must provide ongoing services to at least 200 foster children in Arizona and spend at least 50% of its budget on ongoing services to foster children in Arizona. You don't have to determine which ones qualify, because you can find a list of those approved organizations on the AZ Department of Revenue’s website. You do not have to itemize deductions to claim a credit for this charitable contribution. Donations to qualifying foster care charitable organizations must be claimed on Arizona Form 352. You must also total your nonrefundable individual income tax credits on Form 301. \nNew for 2016: The passage of Senate Bill 1216 means that there are now increased ceilings for Arizona tax credits to qualified organizations. Taxpayers filing as “single” and “head of household” and “married filing separate” may claim a maximum credit of $500. Taxpayers that file as “married filing joint” may claim a maximum credit of $1,000. \nRead the complete and official information about the Arizona Department of Revenue Charitable Tax Credit . \nTip : New in 2016, credit eligible contributions that are made on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year (April 15, in most cases) may be applied to either the current or the preceding taxable year. \nTip: New in 2016, donations to Qualifying Charitable Organizations and donations to Qualifying Foster Care Charitable Organizations will be claimed as separate credits with separate limitations for each. 3 - Public School Tax Credits \nIf you don't itemize deductions on your income tax, you can still do good for others by contributing to education in Arizona through the School Tax Credit. You would report that contribution on Arizona Form 322. \nYou don't have to have a child in school, but you must have a tax liability for at least the amount of your donation. In other words, if you only owe $100, you can't get a $200 tax credit. The school also has to be qualified by the Arizona Department of Revenue. All Arizona public schools qualify, and there are some special schools that do, too. If you don't owe Arizona taxes this year, but you feel you will in the next few years, you may carry forward your school tax credit for up to five consecutive taxable years. \nThese monies are not used to fund regular school activities. The donations you make can only be used for extracurricular activities, like sports programs, field trips, after-school tutoring programs, after school arts programs, etc. or designated \"character education programs.\" You are allowed to specify which programs you'd like your donation to support. \nRead the complete and official information about the Arizona Department of Revenue School Tax Credit . You'll find the links to the lists of eligible schools, including charter schools, here. \nFor public school donations an Arizona tax credit is available up to the maximum $200/yr (single) or $400/yr (married filing jointly). New in 2016: you can make this type of contribution from January 1, 2017 through April 15, 2017 and claim it as a tax credit for either the tax year 2016 or 2017. 4 - Individual Private School Tuition Tax Credit \nContributions to qualified private schools under this program are used to fund scholarships for tuition or grants. There are two private school donation tax credits available: Credit for Contributions to Private School Tuition Organizations (use form 323), and Credit for Contributions to Certified School Tuition Organizations (use form 348). \nThe maximum tax credit for tax year 2016 for for single taxpayers under the Credit for Contributions to Private School Tuition Organizations is $545 and for married taxpayers filing jointly is $1,090. \nThe maximum tax credit for tax year 2016 for for single taxpayers under the Credit for Contributions to Certified School Tuition Organizations is $542 and for married taxpayers filing jointly is $1,083. This credit is only available to those individuals that first donated the maximum amount allowed under the Credit for Contributions to Private School Tuition Organizations on Arizona Form 323. \nNew in 2016: you can make this type of contribution from January 1, 2017 through April 15, 2017 and claim it as a tax credit for either the tax year 2016 or 2017. \nRead the complete and official information about the Arizona Department of Revenue School Tax Credit . You'll also find the links to the list of schools eligible for this type of contribution. \nTip : An individual can claim public school and a school tuition tax credits in the same year. How I Make My Decision on the Arizona Public School Tax Credit \nThis year I'll be contributing to a public school and receiving the tax credit. There's a somewhat unusual consequence associated with the school tax credit: it is likely that in those districts where families have higher incomes, schools might receive more donations than the ones where the families have lower incomes. That's because even though it's a tax credit, you must advance the money before you receive it back in the form of a tax credit. \nThere's nothing wrong with contributing to your own child's school, but I decided to do it a little differently. I did some research about schools where the kids might be in more need of after-school programs and opportunities. I found an elementary school where the kids were trying hard, but not quite achieving the educational requirements of the state, where the dropout rate was not bad, where basically all of the kids qualified under the subsidized lunch program in a low-income area. \nYour criteria for selecting a school is a matter of personal choice. Here are some resources for researching schools.
