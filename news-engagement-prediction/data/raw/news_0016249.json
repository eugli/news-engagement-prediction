Byer rbyer@sacbee.com 1 of 2 i \nBy Andy Furillo and Sam Stanton \nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra and 15 other attorneys general filed a “friend of the court” brief Monday denouncing the Trump administration travel ban as harming the states’ universities by threatening entry into thei country for thousands of overseas scholars and others. \nBecerra joined with officials from New York, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and the District of Columbia is urging the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to deny an administration effort to restore the travel restrictions, which were suspended Friday by a federal judge in Seattle. \n“The executive order has inflicted and continues to inflict harm on state colleges and universities around the country... which rely on faculty and students from across the world,” the brief states. \nAt the 10 University of California campuses, for instances, almost 500 graduate students and 40 undergraduate students may be affected by the temporary ban on travel from seven Muslim majority nations if it is restored, the brief argues. \n“California universities and colleges host the largest number of students from the seven targeted countries,” the brief states. “The overwhelming majority of them are from Iran, with 1,286 visas issued to students headed to California institutions in 2015. \n“The executive order abruptly prevented a large number of anticipated tourists and students from traveling to the states, directly and immediately decreasing the revenues flowing to state academic institutions and tax authorities.” \nThe brief is among more than a dozen that have been filed so far by refugee advocate groups, constitutional scholars and technology companies such as eBay, Google and Apple arguing that the ban, if restored, would harm them and the nation. \n“The order effects a sudden shift in the rules governing entry into the United States, and is inflicting substantial harm on U.S. companies,” the firms argue in their brief. “It hinders the ability of American companies to attract great talent; increases costs imposed on business; makes it more difficult for American firms to compete in the international marketplace; and gives global enterprises a new, significant incentive to build operations—and hire new employees—outside the United States.” \nThe Trump administration has until 3 p.m. Monday to file documents outlining its reasons for why the Seattle judge’s order should be overturned. \nThe fight currently is before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, which must decide whether to uphold a temporary restraining order issued Friday by a federal judge in Seattle. Government attorneys have until 3 p.m. Monday to file their arguments over why the judge’s order should be tossed out and the ban reimposed. \nTrump’s order would halt immigration from Syria, Iraq, Libya, Iran, Sudan, Yemen and Somalia for 90 days and halt the arrivals of refugees from all countries for 120 days while federal authorities devise additional security screening procedures. \nRefugee advocates began filing their own briefs Monday with the court, arguing that President Trump’s executive order is endangering refugees and family members of U.S. citizens. \n“The executive order has fractured many refugee families whose safety and desire for unification were already fragile, and risks the lives of many who relied on the promises of the United States when they received their visas,” a brief filed by the non-profit refugee assistance group HIAS Inc. states. “Those people made irreversible plans to leave the countries in which they were residing, and followed established procedures to obtain their visas and permission to enter the United States.” \nThe group cites four clients whose lives have been upended by the president’s order, including an Iraqi man who lives near Mosul and was scheduled to fly to Los Angeles on Thursday. \nThe client, identified only as “Mark” to protect his safety, served as an interpreter for U.S. Army forces and “also served in combat, fighting alongside American troops and risking his life in military operations in northern and southern Iraq,” the brief states. \nBecause of his service, the Iraqi man is fearful of being discovered and killed by Islamic State militants sighting in Mosul, which is a one-hour drive from his home, the brief states. \nAfter passing “a rigorous screening process,” the man was approved for refugee status and prepared to flee to the United States with his wife and three children, purchasing airline tickets, obtaining visas and selling all of his belongings, the brief states. \nInstead, the U.S. Embassy in Jordan called him after the president’s order was issued on Jan. 27 and told him that because he is from Iraq his travel had been canceled, according to the brief. \n“They are now rescheduled to arrive in Los Angeles on Feb. 14, 2017,” the brief says. “If they cannot travel then, they risk having to renew their medical screenings, which expire on Feb. 23, 2017. \n“They also risk the fear of being discovered and harmed or killed by ISIL or by artillery related to the battles in Mosul.” \nFollowing the initial uproar over the travel restrictions, the Trump administration exempted special visa holders who assisted the military in Iraq and Afghanistan, and it was not clear Monday whether the Iraqi man and his family would be allowed entry if the courts ultimately uphold the executive order. \nA separate brief filed jointly by the American Civil Liberties Union and its Washington state branch argues that the executive order is in clear violation of the Constitution’s prohibition on the government favoring one religion over another. \n“The order is motivated by bias against Muslims, as confirmed by the president’s own public statements, as well as the absence of any rational justification for the categorical exclusion of individuals from the seven identified nations or the complete ban on refugees from around the world,” the ACLU brief states. “The religious discrimination involved in the executive order is inconsistent with the bedrock Establishment Clause and equal protection principle that the government should never favor one religion over another.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:28:47.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
