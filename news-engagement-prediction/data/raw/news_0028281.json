To be clear, we're not talking Gucci Mane (who still, somehow, remains Grammy-less), but the Gucci that belongs to Alessandro Michele and his high-octane designs. The Italian brand's wares were spotted on stage, on the red carpet, and on artists of all genres all night long. There were Gucci suits, T-shirts, dresses, and even a couple of adorable kids-sized tuxedos. Let's check out of a few of our favorite Gucci looks from the night here. \nJames Corden (and Blue Ivy Carter) \nThough James came through in one of his many looks with this back embroidery Gucci tuxedo, it's fair to say he got majorly upstaged by Blue Ivy Carter's pink tuxedo (also worn by another music world offspring, Schoolboy Q's daughter ) \nMagnus Larrson of Lukas Graham \nGucci's designs these days are so bold that you don't even need a proper tuxedo (or even a jacket) to stand out. \nJohn Legend \nLil Yachty \nFor his first Grammys appearance, the rapper doubled down on swervy Gucci pieces, starting with an embroidered neck bow on the red carpet and ending the night in a yellow tipped blazer with tiger embroidery at Chance the Rapper and GQ 's after party. \nJarobi White of A Tribe Called Quest \nMike Will Made It \nBut by far the most recognizably \"New Gucci\" look of the evening went to producer Mike Will Made It, who wore all Gucci and even carried a Gucci briefcase.
