In a still-mysterious envelope mix up, it was Moonlight , not La La Land , that took the top prize. And as the shock of the moment rippled through Hollywood, some of the biggest names in the industry reacted from inside Vanity Fair’s star-studded party. Sofia Vergara and husband Joe Manganiello —who arrived early and had their portraits taken by Mark Seliger —were the ones to break the news to Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon . “That’s horrible!” Witherspoon said in dismay to her Hot Pursuit co-star. “How could that happen?!” Sex and the City producer Michael Patrick King added “It’s shocking. So horrible that happened. It is bad for both of them, La La Land and Moonlight .” Mad Men star Jon Hamm was at the Vanity Fair -hosted Oscar dinner watching the ceremony with a table that included Shonda Rhimes , Game of Thrones showrunner David Benioff , and more. He told Vanity Fair during the Oscar Party live-stream that when La La Land was declared the winner, he excused himself during the speech to visit the restroom. “Somewhere during mid-handwash,” he explained, “there seems to be a kerfuffle.” Hamm said he emerged to see the entire celebrity-packed dining room staring at the screen slack-jawed. “There were a thousand people on stage. It was kind of the greatest, weirdest for an awards show to end ever.” Hamm joked that he wished a similar last-minute reversal had happened during the 2016 election. Less than ten minutes after the upset occurred, Martin Short —ever the nimble improviser—was already working on his Warren Beatty impression as Michael Keaton and Tom Ford looked on. Roping Catherine O’Hara into his bit as his Faye Dunaway, Short started workshopping a routine that will no doubt get repeated play over the next few weeks as Hollywood continues to reel. “At least everyone got to make a speech,” O'Hara said brightly. “First the election, then the Super Bowl, now this,” actor Liev Schrieber said to director Ron Howard , while one Vanity Fair editor was heard jokingly blaming Russia for the mix-up. Meanwhile Hollywood royalty Anjelica Huston and her nephew, Jack Huston , were running a play by play. Even Anjelica—in all her decades of Oscar snubs, surprises, and upsets—seemed taken aback. “Inadvertently you end up feeling terrible for La La Land . You end up feeling for them in the night,” Jack Huston concluded. But both Ron Howard and S.N.L. star Pete Davidson agreed that the unprecedented error made for terrific television and even Bill Maher —no stranger to controversy—declared the upset “what a crazy ending.” But while the the stars continued to react in dismay for La La Land , Beatty, and host Jimmy Kimmel , Oscar winner Patricia Arquette chose to see the bright side: “I feel bad for the person who made that mistake and I hope they don't get fired,” she told Vanity Fair , “But it was exciting to see this beautiful little movie that cost 1.5 million dollars win.” Surely the cast of Moonlight would agree with her.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T14:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T12:41:39.950+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
