Nancy Barto, R-Phoenix, and pushed by the conservative Center for Arizona Policy, would protect from discrimination a health-care provider that refuses to participate in any service or provide any item that results in the death of an individual.\nIt would apply to individuals, such as doctors or nurses, and entire medical facilities. The bill now moves to the House after a 17-13 party-line vote, with Republicans in support.\nUnlike in several other states, assisted suicide is not legal in Arizona and thus health-care workers don't participate in that action. Center for Arizona Policy President Cathi Herrod said during a prior hearing on the bill that it would allow health-care providers to decide what action they feel violates their religious beliefs.\nThat lack of specificity has raised concerns that doctors or nurses may refuse to carry out an individual's end-of-life instructions, which could include not performing life-saving CPR or not inserting a breathing tube, ceasing food or water, or increasing some medications.\nBarto has said the protections in the bill exist in Arizona as part of the federal Affordable Care Act, and said she is not aware of conflicts with advance directives. This bill is needed, she said, because Congress is considering eliminating the Affordable Care Act.\nHowever, unlike the federal law, the Arizona bill does not state instances where the protection wouldn't apply, including withholding medical care; withdrawing food or water; abortion; or providing an item or service for the purpose of alleviating pain, even if the action may increase the risk of death.\nAmendment on CPR During a Senate Committee of the Whole vote Wednesday, Barto amended the bill to clarify that health-care providers cannot ignore patient instructions regarding CPR.\nSen. Steve Farley, D-Tucson, said the amendment doesn't fix the problem. The bill, he said, \"takes away the rights of a living will.\"\n\"To try to legislate something that would affect the end of life ... is standing between the doctors and the families who are affected,\" he said. \"That's a terrible idea.\"\nSen. Debbie Lesko, R-Peoria, supported the bill. She maintained it does not apply to advance directives and that the amendment \"gives further assurances.\"\nSenate Minority Leader Katie Hobbs, D-Phoenix, said the amendment does nothing to clarify the issue.\n\"While people testified that this wasn't intended to interfere with advance directives for end-of-life treatment, that's not clear in the bill,\" she said. \"This bill doesn't put the wishes of the patient over the conscience of the health-care provider.\"\nReach the reporter on Twitter @aliarau or via email at alia.rau@arizonarepublic.com.", "external_links": ["http://download.gannett.edgesuite.net/arizonarepublic/brightcove/29901534001/201702/967/29901534001_5326234501001_5326233498001-th.jpg?pubId=29901534001", "http://azc.cc/2ldhWYh", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/16/Phoenix/Phoenix/636228791425190465-StethoscopeGettyiStockphoto.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2286.0/images/sprites/icon_close.png", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2m9sA5u&mini=true", "http://download.gannett.edgesuite.net/arizonarepublic/brightcove/29901534001/201702/967/29901534001_5326233057001_5326233498001-vs.jpg?pubId=29901534001", "http://download.gannett.edgesuite.net/arizonarepublic/brightcove/29901534001/201702/967/29901534001_5326233057001_5326233498001-vs.jpg", "http://download.gannett.edgesuite.net/arizonarepublic/brightcove/29901534001/201702/967/29901534001_5326234501001_5326233498001-th.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//azc.cc/2m9sA5u&text=Arizona%20Senate%20OKs%20bill%20that%20would%20let%20providers%20opt%20out%20of%20%27right%20to%20die%27%20efforts%E2%80%8B&via=azcentral", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3d5569507733ca056af5edaf0a2a8036c559fb13/r=500x375/local/-/media/2017/02/16/Phoenix/Phoenix/636228791425190465-StethoscopeGettyiStockphoto.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/52917f55e06237fd9dd93f058d46ed87e0a4b1bc/r=540/http/download.gannett.edgesuite.net/arizonarepublic/brightcove/29901534001/201702/967/29901534001_5326233057001_5326233498001-vs.jpg", "http://bcdownload.gannett.edgesuite.net/azc-mobile/201702/967/29901534001_5326234372001_5326233498001.mp4", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f6971d504a6d894cb7944de3d383c26c5c6bb869/c=0-0-533-401&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2017/02/16/Phoenix/Phoenix/636228791425190465-StethoscopeGettyiStockphoto.png"], "published": "2017-02-23T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:06:07.659+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
