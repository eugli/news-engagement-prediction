The 16-acre project is called the Franklin Urban Sports + Entertainment, or FUSE, district and demolition starts later this week to make way for a new downtown ballpark. That multi-purpose site will serve as the home field for the Gastonia Grizzlies and much more. Enlarge Jesse Cole’s goal is to throw out the first pitch in the new Gastonia ballpark in… more Gastonia isn’t taking cues from its big brother city to the east, which redeveloped a spot in uptown Charlotte's Third Ward neighborhood into BB&T Ballpark. Instead, the inspiration is coming from a P.T. Barnum figure who owns the Grizzlies: Jesse Cole , who’s known to have his players perform choreographed dances during the college summer league games. “We’re trying to build the most unique ballpark in the world,” says Cole, who owns another college summer league team called the Savannah Bananas. “We’re looking at cruise ships, amusement parks, resorts and other places for inspiration.” This from a guy who wears a yellow tux for the Bananas games. Cole’s goal is to throw out the first pitch in the new Gastonia ballpark in summer 2019 but he acknowledges that planners, developers and builders in Gastonia may not be on his timetable. “I’m going over there with a shovel every single day and digging,” Cole adds with his usual hyperbole. The city of Gastonia has allotted almost $4 million to buy property and begin the task of razing the unusable structures in the district, which straddles West Franklin Boulevard. The bulldozers arrive later this week to take down the former Sears building and others, says Kristy Crisp , business service manager for Gastonia. “We are looking at really transforming that area to connect downtown with Loray Mill into a walkable district,” she says. “Part of FUSE is about making sure we offer something for everyone.” The city will pay the $15-million bill for the multi-purpose ballpark with a bond sale. Possibilities include office space overlooking the ballpark, a hotel, a music venue, apartments, restaurants and perhaps condos and a place for “parents to bring kids to play,” Crisp says. The ballpark would also be the home for concerts, other sports, shows and a rental venue for events, she adds. “It’s really about multi-sports and entertainment,” Crisp says. The Grizzlies now play their Coastal Plain League games in the 65-year-old, 4,000-seat Sims Legion Park in Gastonia. There, Cole has built the Grizzlies from a team with a $100,000 deficit to seasonal revenues of $1 million, using some of those same techniques. Players dress in flannel uniforms and sometimes in faux tuxes. Events-people bury diamond rings in the infield dirt and there’s a retired ice cream truck converted into a bar at Sims Legion Park. The city wants to open the space up for private developers to build in FUSE and perhaps to invite a master developer to take a larger role in the project, Crisp says. So much of the 16 acres will return to the tax rolls. Build-out will take five to 10 years, Crisp estimates. Meanwhile, the city isn’t taking the scorched-earth philosophy to clearing the site. Two historic buildings — the 123-year-old Trenton Mill and a former Coca-Cola bottling plant that now houses metalworking company Fab-Tech Inc. — will be saved and redeveloped. Fab-Tech and the Budget Inn, whose building will be razed, are getting 18 months of free rent and relocation assistance. Further west from the site, the 115-year-old former Loray Mill is now Loray Mill Village, a $68 million residential and commercial project that will eventually have 290 apartments . Gastonia is looking further south than Charlotte for ideas for an entertainment and residential district — to Greenville, S.C. There, city leaders built a minor league baseball stadium surrounding by shops, restaurants, hotels and other businesses. Within four years after the work was completed on the stadium-anchored district, 110 new businesses have opened within a half-mile of the ballpark.
