So even this visa related issue is an issue on which we would want to have an air of certainty and also transparency,\" she told reporters. \n\nShe said the bipartisan Congressmen stated at a meeting here yesterday that they are waiting for the new administration to fully settle down. \n\n\"I hope as important Congressmen, they will play their role,\" she said. \n\nThe minister was speaking on the sidelines of launch of a report by the United Nations . \n\nThe US delegation was led by Bob Goodlatte, chairman, Judiciary committee, House of Representatives. \n\nThe proposed overhaul of popular H-1B visa regime by US President Donald Trump has raised concerns among Indian IT firms , as any changes in the visa regime may result in higher operational costs and shortage of skilled workers for the $110-billion Indian outsourcing industry. \n\nIndian IT sector, which contributes 9.3 per cent to the country's GDP , is one of the largest private sector employers of 3.7 million people. \n\nThe US accounts for nearly 62 per cent of the exports, while EU is the second largest market for the Indian IT services exporters with around 28 per cent contribution. \n\nRecently, a US legislation (Lofgren Bill) has been introduced that proposes doubling of the minimum wages of H-1B visa holders to $130,000. The current H-1B minimum wage of $60,000 was fixed in 1989 and has since remained unchanged. \n\nSuch protectionist stance by the US could also spell more trouble for IT firms that are already facing strong headwinds from currency fluctuation and cautious client spending. \n\nWhen asked about her meeting with a EU delegation yesterday, Sitharaman said the proposed free trade agreement and the Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) came up for the discussion. \n\n\"They did ask me about our position on FTA and BIT...We stated our position. Clearly two years ago, the discussions have started on the BIT...last one year we repeatedly being saying that from April 1. So we voiced all this back again to the EU delegation,\" she added. \n\nOn the FTA, she said no timeline was fixed for the next round of negotiations but \"I did say that the sooner we start\". \n\n\"We are open minded and we need to have the dialogue moving forward and we are waiting for the dates. We reminded that talks are necessary. Now the talks have to be resumed. There is no point in meet just to take stalk of where we are,\" the minister added. \n\nLaunched in June 2007, BTIA negotiations have seen many hurdles with both sides having major differences on crucial issues like intellectual property rights, duty cuts in automobile as well as spirits and a liberal visa regime.
