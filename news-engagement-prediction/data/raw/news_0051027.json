The boys, both 14, were killed in the accident. \nDuring her visits, Asiah handed over financial aid of RM850 each to the two families from the Johor Wo­­men and Family Affairs Department and the Welfare Department. \nMeanwhile, Bernama reported that the state government would also give RM1,000 each to eight of the injured teenagers. \nState Islamic Religious Committee chairman Abd Mutalip Abd Rahim said the aid was on top of the assistance given to the next of kin in line with the state government’s efforts to help the families. \n“The RM1,000 will be given to the seriously injured victims who are undergoing treatment,” he told re­­por­­ters after opening the Shariah-compliant Carnival at Polytechnic Metro Johor Baru. \nIn the tragedy on Saturday, the car ploughed into the group of teenagers at about 3.30am. \nSix died on the spot while two others succumbed to injuries while on the way to Sultanah Aminah Hospital. \nTwo other teenagers are in critical condition at the intensive care unit of the hospital while six more have broken bones and head injuries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T01:25:36.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
