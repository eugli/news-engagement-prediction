Makeda Easter Adele receives the Grammy for song of the year as her producer Greg Kurstin looks on during the 59th Grammy music Awards. (VALERIE MACON / AFP/Getty Images) \nAfter winning her Grammy for song of the year for \"Hello,\" Adele used much of her acceptance speech to thank the song's producer and co-writer Greg Kurstin. \n“I’d like to thank Greg because Greg kept coming to England for me, to work with me,\" Adele said. \n“He would come to me in England so I didn’t have to leave my son and yet he would leave [his] son and daughter. So thank you for your patience with me and for helping to create my favorite song I’ve ever done.” \nBut when Kurstin, a native Angeleno, stepped up to the microphone, music began to play, cutting him off entirely and drawing boos from the audience. Earlier, during the non-televised portion of the show, Kurstin accepted a Grammy for producer of the year, nonclassical. \nThe interruption was not lost on viewers who expressed their outrage on Twitter.
