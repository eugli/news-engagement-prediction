For. Five. Years. \nPiolo and Shaina recently divulged about the relationship during a press conference. They have been exclusively dating for about five years already, but why keep it a secret until now? Apparently it was because of mutual respect, they did not want to make things public. \nEven after years of dating, Piolo still doesn’t want to label the relationship, what matters is that they value, treasure, and appreciate what they both have. \nShaina, on the other hand, wants to take things slow. She shared that she values commitment and that is why she is taking her time. She said that if she will have a boyfriend, that means he’s probably the one she wants to marry and while she waits for that to happen, she’ll focus on work. \nLet that sink in for Valentine’s Day, Piolo Pascual (who we lovingly call Papa P) is taken. Now pass the chocolates and lemonade moscato , please. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:46:09.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
