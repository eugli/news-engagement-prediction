TNN | Updated: Feb 23, 2017, 09.21 AM IST It's Karan Singh Grover 's birthday today and no prizes for guessing that his darling wife Bipasha Basu had a huge surprise waiting for him. Ahead of his birthday, Bipasha whisked her husband away on a surprise holiday to Goa. The couple's common friends Deanne Pandey, Rocky S, Arti Singh and Ayaz Khan too joined them in the beach getaway. A post shared by bipashabasusinghgrover (@bipashabasu) on Feb 22, 2017 at 1:48pm PST As the clock struck 12, Bipasha pulled out all stops as she brought in Karan's birthday in style. The 'Alone' actress sported a tee that had Karan's picture printed on it while the rest of the gang too wore similar tees. Karan, on the other hand, was seen wearing a t-shirt that read, \"Monkey Prince\". Bipasha posted pictures from the big night on her Instagram account with the message, \"@iamksgofficial you are my everything. Happy birthday my love #monkeylove\". A post shared by bipashabasusinghgrover (@bipashabasu) on Feb 22, 2017 at 2:12pm PST Karan too shared pictures from their getaway. While some pictures see the entire group of friends as they are en route to Goa, the 'Hate Story 3' actor also posted a lovely video of the pre-birthday bash that they had in Mumbai with their friends. If the video is anything to go by, the pre-birthday bash was one helluva party. Karan can be seen in a goofy mode as he poses with Bipasha and his friends, and parties the night away. The video also sees Bipasha stealing a kiss with Karan during the revelry - a moment that will surely make you go 'aww'!
