And I don’t know what religion they are, but her dad sounds a little Jewish — doesn’t matter.” \n“Dory arrives in America with her friends Marlin and Nemo,” she continued. “And she ends up at the Marine Life Institute behind a large wall. They all have to get over the wall and you won’t believe it, but that wall has almost no effect in keeping them out.” \nDeGeneres said that, when Dory arrives in America, “she ends up separated from her family, but the other animals help Dory.” \n“Animals that don’t even need her,” she continued. “Animals that don’t even have anything in common with her. They help her, even though they’re completely different colors. Because that’s what you do when you see someone in need, you help them.” \nDeGeneres concluded that she hopes that is a lesson “everyone who’s watching Finding Dory has learned.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:29:03.776+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
