No passenger or cargo vehicles will move, said Transport Workers Federation Khulna Regional Committee President Azizul Alam Mintu. Inter-district travellers have also faced difficulties because of the strike. Many have left the terminal after being unable to find transport. The strike was announced on Saturday after an emergency meeting at the regional committee offices in Jessore. Leaders and activists from 34 transport workers' bodies attended the meeting. They claim that Chuadanga Deluxe driver Jamir Hossain had been ‘sentenced unfairly’. On Aug 13, 2011, a bus crash on the Dhaka-Aricha Highway in Manikganj killed five, including filmmaker Tareque Masud and the then CEO of ATN News Mishuk Munier. \nOn Feb, 22 Manikganj Additional District and Sessions Judge Al-Mahmud Faizul Kabir sentenced bus driver Jamir Hossain to live in prison. The workers ‘had to strike’, said Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation Regional Committee General Secretary Abdur Rahim Boks Dudu. “Workers refuse to drive with a life sentence hanging over their heads.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T18:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T10:05:30.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
