The delays stretched up to 25 minutes, but by about 9.10am, the company updated that trains were progressively returning to normal speed along the affected stretch. [EWL]: Due to a track work, pls add 15 mins travel time from #JurongEast to #JooKoon towards #JooKoon . Train service is still available. — SMRT Corporation (@SMRT_Singapore) February 7, 2017 [EWL]UPDATE:Pls add 25 mins travel time from #JurongEast towards #JooKoon ,due to a track work at #JooKoon .
