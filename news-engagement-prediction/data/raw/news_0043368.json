Internet broadband for your home: Which network is the fastest and which one should you choose? While some service providers have been offering hundreds of Mbps in metro cities, according to 'state of internet' reports by Akamai the average internet speed in India is still around 4.1Mbps. By: Sumit Chakraborty | Published: February 20, 2017 2:08 PM If you are looking for high-speed internet at your home, there are many network providers which give you the option of 50Mbps or more. There are options of lower speeds too, but there is a bone of contention there, as the fares are extremely confusing. (Picture: Reuters) \nIt is the best time in India, right now, to be an internet and data user, because of the digital revolution that the country is going through. But is the technical prowess that India appears to be on the path of, getting evenly distributed in India? While some service providers have been offering hundreds of Mbps in metro cities, according to ‘state of internet’ reports by Akamai the average internet speed in India is still around 4.1Mbps. Meanwhile, according to a Quora thread, if you need to look for the fastest connect in India, you need to go to Startup Village in Kochi, where people have posted screenshots of speeds up to a whopping 1Gbps. The speeds discussed in this article, however, are not verified information, instead of on what people have posted and shared telecom forums on social media platforms like Reddit, Twitter and Quora. \nIf you are looking for high-speed internet at your home, there are many network providers which give you the option of 50Mbps or more. There are options of lower speeds too, but there is a bone of contention there, as the fares are extremely confusing. While big players like Airtel offers 16MBps speed for a cap of 30 to 100 GBs, the same amount of money can give you unlimited 150 Mbps speed from internet providers like Hathway and many other local services. But there is a basic difference one needs to understand, which will provide a better clarity of the speeds that the ISPs offer. \nThere is a difference between MBps and Mbps, and you need to check the unit before you get overawed by the face value of the number. So, if a provider says it will give you the internet at the speed of 100 Mbps, it essentially means 12.5 MBps. So Airtel’s 16MBps is definitely more than a service which says 100 Mbps. \nComing back to the internet providers, Airtel’s offers can go up to 100 Mbps in a few cities and you can check if your city is one of them. You can also opt for V-Fiber which the company has been rolling out recently. It is a form of vectorisation, which is a commonly used broadband technology in European countries as it provides users with high bandwidth and reduced interference in the connection. However, Airtel is on the costlier side, when it comes to pricing, but ensures smooth connectivity and lesser regular issues. Airtel, according to Netflix data, is the fastest internet connection in India. Meanwhile Hayai is a new service which has been getting quite popular, especially among the youth, because of its other offers that come bundled with it. But according to reports, the services is limited to very few areas and has not been expanding much. Hathway is another famous broadband service providers and is available at more than a dozen Indian cities. It is used by many people in the metros because of its cheap pricing and high speed. \n\nThere are other internet service providers like YOU broadband and Den broadband which provide really cheap tariffs but are focussed on just a few North Indian cities. Ther are many issues which people have posted regarding their service. Some of the people said that another internet provider ACT Fibernet is a better option, especially for South Indian cities like Bengaluru. Another new provider, Spectranet is slowly getting quite popular in Delhi NCR because of its ‘unlimited internet’ plans. According to the company, it will expand to more cities soon. \nThere are a few public sector internet providers like BSNL and MTNL but despite its good speeds, the tariffs are exorbitantly high and that makes it unpopular choices. All in all, if you live in a big city like Mumbai or New Delhi, you have a lot of choices and it depends on your requirement, which one you select. Either you select a cheap broadband with unlimited data and tolerate a few issues, or you can go for a bigger company and pay more for limited data, but no problems. But if you are reading this from a small Indian city, unfortunately, you have fewer choices and have to go for bigger players like Airtel and Tata Docomo and pay accordingly. But, before you go for a connection, please read the terms and conditions of the offers as there are many local providers which might use exceptions to fool you.
