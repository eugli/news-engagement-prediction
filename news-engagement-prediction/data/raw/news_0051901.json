(Photo: Provided by Brad Flaskamp)\n13 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE An Indianapolis pastor says his congregation is praying for the person or people that vandalized a statue of Jesus Christ outside a near-south side church.\nPastor Brad Flaskamp of Cottage Avenue Pentecostal Fellowship said members of the church have now twice reported vandalism done to the statue. In the first instance, Flaskamp said, someone knocked the head off of the statue and left it nearby. The second time, the head was missing completely and likely stolen.\nWhile the church, located in the 800 block of Cottage Avenue, has been in the community since 1899, the sculpture has been up at the church about four years, he said. The woman who gave the sculpture to the church made repairs to the statue after the first incident. She cemented the head back on Saturday and was planning to repaint the statue Sunday before the second incident.\nFlaskamp said some of the children that attend church with relatives or grandparents seem to be heartbroken over the vandalism.\n“To them, that’s a symbol that Jesus is always around,\" he said.\nIndianapolis Metropolitan Police are investigating the incident and have reported it to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, according to IMPD Sgt. Kendale Adams. Police have not specified whether the vandalism fits the FBI's definition of a hate crime .\nFlaskamp said he's not sure if it's a hate crime. He said it's likely someone who has ill feelings about God or maybe just someone that doesn't like the statue for one reason or another.\n\"Whatever they’re doing, they ain't hurting God at all,\" he said. \"All it does is just make us more persistent. We’re just gonna rebuild it.\"\nCurrently, investigators have no leads. Adams said anyone with possible information regarding the incident should contact police.\nFlaskamp said he and other members of the congregation are praying God changes the heart of whoever committed the crime.\n\"We’re praying for you,\" he said. \"If you’d like to bring it back, we’d gladly accept the head back, and we’d accept you as well.\"\nCall IndyStar reporter Holly Hays at (317) 444-6156.
