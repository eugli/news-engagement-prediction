She openly asked them if they were into the “business of curing patients or selling construction material.” \n\nBanerjee all accused the some of the private hospitals of producing “inflated bills with no transparency.” Expressing her disgust on commercialisation of services at the hospitals the chief minister has asked these facilities to come clean at the earliest. \n\nBanerjee today held a meeting with all the private hospitals in Town hall following the vandalism at the Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) hospital by an unruly mob few days back. \n\n“We have taken up investigations into the complaints against several private hospitals and nursing homes. At present investigation is on into 942 cases. We have served show cause notices to 70 such hospitals and licenses cancelled in 33 cases,” added Banerjee. \n\nThe chief minister further assured the hospitals that her government would never support vandalism and rioting in hospital premises, but the hospitals should stop 'selling' treatment in this way, she added.
