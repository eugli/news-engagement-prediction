Sims accepted the job to coach running backs for the Paladins last week.\nSims coached at Shorter for the past two seasons as its quarterbacks and fullbacks coach, his first coaching job. He was hired at Furman by coach Clay Hendrix, who was previously offensive coordinator at Air Force, which runs an option offense similar to Tech’s (and Shorter’s). Hendrix replaced Bruce Fowler, who resigned after six seasons. Sims is from South Carolina, starring at Calhoun High.\nAt Shorter, Sims coached fullback B.J. McCoy, who was fifth in Division II in rushing yards per game (148.9) in 2015.\nAt 26, Sims is among the youngest coaches in the Southern Conference. Other assistant coaches on the Furman staff have coached between two and 28 years to reach that point. His aspiration is to be a college head coach.\nAt Tech, Sims started at B-back for three seasons (2011-13) and was a team captain as a senior.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:44:20.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
