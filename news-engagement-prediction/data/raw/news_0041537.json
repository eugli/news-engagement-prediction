There’s no word yet on why the restaurant shuttered, nor any news of the newcomer that will be taking over the lease at 2506 Haste Street. [Berkeleyside] February 3 Six closures to account for this week, with Lefty O’Doul’s certainly getting the most noise. It’s been a back-and-forth battle between the building owners and business owner as to who has the rights to the name and memorabilia, and it’s up to the courts now to decide its fate.
