But we do need to keep an eye on the overall numbers, as a large percentage of infants born at this stage still do not survive.\n\"Those who survive without significant impairment at about age two are still at risk for numerous other challenges to their overall health.\"\nFull-term babies are born at 37 to 40 weeks.\nProf Michael Cotten, one of the other lead researchers, said changes in the culture of neonatal intensive care units were behind the improvement.\n\"We've taken a big focus on preventing infections, and there's a lot more encouragement and support for the use of mothers' milk than there was 15 years ago, which has also been linked to better outcomes.\"\nThere has also been a decrease in infection rates in neonatal intensive care units over the past two decades, which Prof Cotten said was important.\nThe greater use of steroids in mothers at risk of premature birth to help the baby develop in the womb is also thought to have contributed to the increase in survival and fewer signs of developmental delay, he added.", "external_links": ["http://www.nejm.org/", "https://corporate.dukehealth.org/", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/113AC/production/_94627507_neonatology-spl.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-16T03:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:02:25.252+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
