And the Rivals250 member came away just as impressed with the 'Noles.\nAfter his visit on Saturday, Moore talked about some of the highlights of the trip and also his relationship with FSU quality control assistant Tino Sunseri.\n\"It was really good. Just like I expected it to be,\" Moore said. \"I was able to come up here and vibe with Tino and the rest of the coaching staff. Me and Tino have been talking for a while. The relationship we have built is crazy. It's probably one of the best I have out of anyone recruiting me.\"\nAlthough he is new to the state, Moore is no stranger to FSU. He said he's been in contact with the 'Noles for quite some time and has spent a lot of time looking into the Seminoles' program.\n\"I would say last year it started when Coach Tino started hitting me up,\" Moore said. \"The attitude the coaches had for me was real. I did my research on them, and everything they have is everything I want in a college. I love everything about FSU.\"\nMoore, who said he measured in at 6-foot-2 and 170 pounds, said he particularly enjoyed getting to spend time with FSU coach Jimbo Fisher and receivers coach Lawrence Dawsey. He liked their personalities as well as what they told him about the Seminoles' offense.", "external_links": ["https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/oecv6ruqr0yeq9be3dp3", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/oecv6ruqr0yeq9be3dp3)"], "published": "2017-02-19T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:29:51.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
