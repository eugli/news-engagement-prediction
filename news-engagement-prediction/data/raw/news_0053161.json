Clint Eastwood is an amazing actor with directing talent that rivals his acting. This movie is a masterpiece. It is as simple as that. Every western fan should absolutely love this movie and even those who do not like westerns should find a deep interest in it. Awesome! My favorite movie! Western deconstruction by elizisaiahbeth It's hard to express all the great reasons I love this movie. Just as Silence of the Lambs was to horror, and Saving Private Ryan was to war movies, Unforgiven was to deconstructing the Western Myth Genre. Direction is purposeful and sparse, photography is beautiful, acting is perfect, writing is flawless, editing is excellent, set design is inspiring, and production is without measure. Like The Passion of the Christ, Unforgiven trancends it's makers and becomes a brilliant work that stands on it's own, not so much written and directed, but concieved and born. The movie that saved the west in cinema by Sexyman123 Clint Eastwood is a talented actor as well as director. Most importantly, he takes on risks. Such as his sequel to flags of our fathers with the equally respectful and understanding Letters from iwo jima, following the japanese side of the battle. so back in 1992 when the western was as good as gone, clint eastwood visits his roots from his spaghetti western days to create possibly his masterpiece, if not close to it. telling the story of a man drawn back into a life of violence, you see the contrasting scenery and plot. the natural beauty of rural kansas mixed with the brutality and violence that was the old west, and the truth behind the myths of dime novel sharpshooters. the strong characters and suspense of what will happen next will lead you to the end, where you'll shake your head in disbelief at how quick people change. that is all i can say. watch and enjoy what is a classic in cinema.
