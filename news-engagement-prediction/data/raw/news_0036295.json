He may view moving to China as an opportunity for a final huge payday in his career and a chance for increased game time in a rapidly-emerging league. Meanwhile, United, for whom Rooney has been a dedicated servant since his 2004 move from Everton for Â£27 million, could bring in a big transfer fee as he is still contracted to the club to 2019. Rooney netted a late equaliser against Stoke City earlier this month to surpass Sir Bobby Charlton as United's all-time leading goalscorer: He holds the same distinction for England. However, he is not the player he once was and has been eclipsed as both United's key striker and leader by Ibrahimovic in 2016-17, according to BT Sport's Harry Redknapp: BT Sport Football @btsportfootball 'The new leader of the football club.' @Redknapp says Zlatan has taken over from @WayneRooney at @ManUtd. #MUNSTE https://t.co/WBX6TYTk6R 2/16/2017, 10:50:43 PM Per Ducker, a summer departure for Rooney from United is potentially a more likely scenario, but \" Chinese suitors are working hard to make a deal happen.\" It would be a huge boost for the Chinese Super League were they to snap up Rooney, one of the most recognisable faces in football, while United could bring in a big fee for a player who is past his peak. Meanwhile, United manager Jose Mourinho has reportedly won his battle to sign Benfica centre-back Victor Lindelof. VI-Images/Getty Images According to TuttoMercatoWeb (h/t The Sun 's Geoff Sweet ), the Red Devils have agreed a pre-contract agreement with Lindelof, meaning they will secure his signature in the summer despite attempts by Roma to hijack the move, and interest from Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. There were numerous reports at the end of 2016 that United would secure the Sweden international in January , per RTP (h/t Uche Amako of the Daily Express ). However, he ended up remaining at Benfica . Per the Manchester Evening News ' Samuel Luckhurst, United need to add strength to their centre-back department in the summer, especially as Chris Smalling could depart having fallen down the pecking order: Samuel Luckhurst @samuelluckhurst Wouldn't be surprised if Shaw &amp; Smalling go in the summer. Still have time to convince but #mufc need to strengthen centre-back &amp; full-back. It would be a huge boon if United have indeed agreed to sign Lindelof, as the 22-year-old is an immense talent and clearly rated by Mourinho. Like the new article format? !
