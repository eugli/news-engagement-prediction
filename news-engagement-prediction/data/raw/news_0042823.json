LaBeouf opened the exhibit in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Saturday after it was shut down in New York. (@thecampaignbook via Twitter) \nLaBeouf was arrested at the New York site less than week after it opened for engaging in an altercation with someone who stepped between him and the camera. \nShia LaBeouf's 'He Will Not Divide Us' shut down due to violence \nThe intention for the project is for people to read the wall's bold writing — \"He Will Not Divide Us\" — into the camera. The artists did not specify how long they hope the exhibit will last in New Mexico, but they previously stated the New York version was supposed to run throughout Trump's presidency.
