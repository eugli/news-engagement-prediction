We are working with the club and currently gathering as much information as possible and will deal with the matter when we have all available facts including CCTV footage.\" Related Content Sydney FC claim referee apologised for costly derby error \nFairfax Media sought comment from Western Sydney Wanderers in response to the FFA investigation on Sunday. The club declined to comment after the game on Saturday night when notified of the banner by reporters. \nWanderers supporters took to social media to celebrate the raising of the banner. The club's active fan group, the Red and Black Bloc, posted a photo on their official Twitter account.

Fairfax Media understands the FFA are working with police investigating reports of a brawl between supporters during half-time. Sources suggest a large group of Wanderers supporters entered a public smoking area behind the designated Sydney FC supporters section in the south end of the stadium where a fight erupted.
