I am grateful for the prompt help, and once again THANK YOU!!!\" \nKone said previous incidents while playing football had helped him gain the knowledge to help Berkovec in a speedy manner. \nHe told Czech media: \"It wasn't the first time I have done that. It's something like the fourth time. Twice in Africa, once in Thailand. I immediately checked to see if he had swallowed his tongue.\" Trending ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:32:05.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
