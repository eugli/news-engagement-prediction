Jimmy Garoppolo (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 12:19 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 12:19 a.m. ET \nThe Browns, users of 26 starting quarterbacks since 1999, have options in their search to find No. 27. \nCleveland could use its No. 1 or No. 12 overall pick to draft one in April, or they might instead decide to pay a premium to acquire Tom Brady understudy Jimmy Garoppolo from the Patriots, a move that likely would require one of the aforementioned picks plus more going back to New England. \nThe Browns at least will \"strongly consider\" Option No. 2, Mary Kay Cabot of Cleveland.com reported Tuesday . \n“Sources say the Browns’ interest in Garoppolo is real and that they’ll try to trade for him depending on how their draft evaluations go over the next five weeks or so,” Cabot wrote. \nThose five weeks will be spent pouring over tape of UNC's Mitch Trubisky or Clemson's Deshaun Watson, the consensus top two quarterbacks in this year's draft class, as well as other potential options the Browns could snag further down the board with one of their 13 picks. \nNone will be as prepared to start in 2017 as Garoppolo, who has shown flashes during his three NFL seasons. But he remains a risky gamble. \nThe 25-year-old has made two starts, both in 2016, when he threw for a combined 496 yards and four touchdowns as the Patriots started 2-0 with Brady suspended. Garoppolo showed poise and talent that made him a second-round pick in 2014, but that's his resume in a nutshell. \nCritics will say he's another product of the Bill Belichick system. \nAfter all, the Patriots have pulled this trick before, cashing in on Matt Cassel (in 2009) and Ryan Mallett (in 2014). Neither panned out with their new teams. \nGaroppolo figures to draw at least a first-round pick from suitors as the Patriots hope for a bidding war between the many quarterback-needy teams. \nIt's likely there will be plenty of them besides the Browns, including the 49ers, as Cabot notes. But the Browns seem willing to pay the price. Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T12:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T09:13:14.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
