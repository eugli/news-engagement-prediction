Its creator, Lizzie Nunnery , carefully describes it as a play with music – not as a musical. It does not build up to standout numbers; no character is defined by a huge solo. Yet sound and song are at the core of Hannah Tyrrell-Pinder’s production, wiring audiences into the detail of what happens on stage.\nNunnery is a performer and songwriter as well as a playwright; on the folk circuit she sings sweetly about harsh lives. Narvik , produced by the Manchester-based company Box of Tricks and first seen in Liverpool in 2015, is a fictionalised documentary and a melancholy ballad. It draws on the experiences of second world war sailors, one of them Nunnery’s grandfather, who took part in the North Atlantic convoys that liberated the Norwegian port of Narvik from the Nazis. The far-reaching narrative is fragmented: it is not always clear; it sometimes strains for poetic effect; yet it is full of rich material.\nThe entire auditorium often seems to wheeze with noise\n\nAn old man is besieged by scenes from his past. He remembers dancing with a Norwegian girlfriend. He recalls a kiss from a shipmate, who called himself Vincent when in Camden and Carlos when in Camberwell. The point is gracefully made that as radio operators the main characters are surrounded by signals and connections – but no one touches anyone else. On land there is liberation and revenge: collaborators are impaled on railings. At sea, there are terrors from the ocean and from warfare. When a ship is holed, the command goes out to batten down the hatches, though down below men are trapped in the rising water, pleading to be let out.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch a filmed trailer for Narvik \nThose men are heard tapping on the pipes that coil around Katie Scott’s pocket-size set. They turn the stage into a percussive instrument. The entire auditorium often seems to wheeze with noise. The soundscape sometimes merely tickles, sometimes arrests the audience’s attention. There are faint gurgles of water, echoes of movement through a hollow metal space, the buzz and tick of radio signals. Composers Vidar Norheim and Martin Heslop thread music – spectral shanties on guitar and keyboard – through the evening.\nNunnery’s work has its own flavour. But this studio work is a kissing cousin to Owen Sheer’s marvellous Pink Mist . A compressed exploration of the effects of war, reaching out to a language other than words.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T10:43:03.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
