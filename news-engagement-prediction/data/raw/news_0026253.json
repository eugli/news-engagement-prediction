Natalie Brown saw the signs (Photo: Daily Mirror) \nAppearing on TV ahead of the drama's airing, she revealed she will never be able to forgive Karen. \n“It started when she did the very first interview outside her house,” recalled Natalie. \n“I was there when the family liaison officer told her not to do the interview or speak to the press until they had as much information as they could get, and then they’d deal with that side of the press. It was due to previous cases when a child has gone missing and it could put their life at risk. But Karen did the interview. \n\"To me, as a mum, why would you do that when you’ve been told it could put a child’s life at risk?” She recently appeared on TV with Julie Bushby (Photo: Rex Features) \nNatalie said she “went straight down and asked her” why she did it, and claimed Karen’s answer was “everybody told me” to do it. \n“[I felt] angry that nobody listened to me or saw what I was seeing about her behaviour or things like that,” added Natalie. Craig Meehan \nCraig Meehan was Karen 's boyfriend at the time - and his uncle Michael Donovan was found to have planned Shannon's disappearance to generate money from the publicity and search.

Craig was recently seen just two miles from where Shannon was found (Photo: The People) \nOver the weekend, the Sunday People revealed how he was seen just two miles from where Shannon was found, he bought groceries and a case of lager, picked up Lotto scratchcards from a newsagent then headed into a bookmaker’s. \nThe ex-fishmonger, now 30 and with a new name, is portrayed in the film but had no part in the fake abduction. Michael Donovan Michael Donovan was sentenced to eight years but was released early (Photo: PA) \nMichael was found guilty of kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice for his role in the stunt. \nAlong with Karen, he was sentenced to eight years in prison - and by the time she was released after serving half the sentence, Donovan had already been released. \nThe Sunday Mirror published a new picture of Donovan snapped outside a coffee shop watching children playing nearby from 2012. \nHe was seen acting bizarrely while sitting on a bench in a Leeds market place. Michael Donovan pictured in 2012 (Photo: John Gladwin/Sunday Mirror) \nHe had been spending six hours a day there and police picked him up after a request from parole officials. \nHe was returned to prison for a brief period. It is not known what happened to him after that. Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T21:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T16:50:45.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
