As TODAY reports , the designer’s jewelry line, called \" Forever Yours, Agnes ,\" features glass baubles containing fragments of the couple’s World War II-era missives. \nThe line is named after—and inspired by—Coomes’s grandmother, Agnes. Seven years ago, the designer was working in the TV industry, which required constant travel. Coomes missed her family, so Grandma Agnes gave her an old letter she had written to her high school sweetheart, a soldier named Thomas, during the 1940s. \nAgnes and Thomas eventually married, but before that, they were separated for three years as Thomas fought abroad. During this time, the couple exchanged thousands of letters; they wrote to each other every day, and even used secret codes to share Thomas’s locations. \nCoomes decided to immortalize her grandparents' romance by turning the letter into a bracelet for herself, and into a ring for her grandmother. These projects became the basis of an entire jewelry line, featuring both her grandparents’ words and the letters of clients requesting a custom memento. Each item of jewelry contains a word or excerpt from a letter; some also feature metal wire, colored glass, and/or stones. \nBoth Grandma Agnes and Grandpa Thomas have passed away, but their words live on, thanks in part to Coomes.
