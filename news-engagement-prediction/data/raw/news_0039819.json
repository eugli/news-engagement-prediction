'Chilling Facebook premonition' put article in contempt \nThe court had previously found that in the article, Johnson suggested Aleluia had been violent towards his girlfriend, Brittany Harvie, in the past. \nA heading towards the end of the article said: \"Brittany Harvie predicted her death on Facebook\". \nJohnson wrote: \"In March last year, Ms Harvie posted a chilling Facebook premonition that she would one day be harmed by the man she loved.\" \nShe then used quotes Ms Harvie had written on her Facebook page about their relationship, including: \"It won't be long and he will put me six feet under. I love him until the day he kills me. He needs a punching bag, we all do.\" \nJustice Dixon said Johnson had shown remorse and experienced shock and shame since the article was published. \n\"She has been subject to criticism of her ability and professionalism as a journalist and has suffered attacks on social media to such an extent that she has suspended her accounts,\" he said. \nThe journalist was given a two-year good behaviour bond. \nThe court heard while the offending conduct was serious, Yahoo7 and Johnson had taken steps to ensure it would not happen again. \nJohnson was not present in court.
