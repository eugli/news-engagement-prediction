Noor Javed News reporter Fri., Feb. 17, 2017 York Region trustee Nancy Elgie has announced she’ll step down, saying her use of a racial slur has “brought undeserved distress” to the community and harmed the school board’s reputation. In a video statement posted on YouTube, a well-spoken Elgie said that over the past 17 years as a trustee, “I have always tried to make a difference, particularly for our most vulnerable children.” She said using the word n to refer to a black parent, after a public meeting last November “was a terrible mistake.” “In a private conversation with Trustee Loralea Carruthers, I was trying to refer to a parent who had been at the board meeting, but I did not know her name, only that she had been featured in media stories about children being called a hurtful racist word. “In trying to explain that, the words came out horribly wrong. I was mortified. I apologized immediately.”   After the remark was overheard by a staff member, who complained, the board hired an independent investigator. York Region school trustee Nancy Elgie announced her decision to resign on Friday after an uproar over her use of a racial slur to refer to a black parent.
