Thankfully, a slew of eco-friendly labels like Stella McCartney and Reformation have come forth to spearhead eco-conscious initiatives, and prove that style and sustainability can happily co-exist. Even H&M, the king of fast fashion, is getting in on the action with the release of its sixth Conscious Exclusive Collection. Fans of the Swedish brand's eco-conscious line will know you won't find regular old jeans and basic tees in the lineups. Instead, there are elegantly draped gowns, jacquard coats, and ornate tops worthy of a black-tie event—and the latest offering is certainly no exception. The new collection, which literally turned trash into treasure, consists of pieces made of a revolutionary material dubbed Bionic. Co-founded by Tyler Toussant, Bionic is essentially recycled polyester made from shoreline wastes like plastic bottles and garbage bags. The fabric functions as an environmentally sustainable material that’s suitable for creating everything from jeans to cocktail attire.

With its billowing skirt and ladylike ruffles, the creation certainly looks like it came off the runways of couture week rather than your favorite fast fashion chain. Courtesy of H&M Of course, sustainability goes beyond just the clothes—our actions play a big part on the initiative, as well. As the campaign star of the new collection, Vodianova is committed to living an eco-friendly lifestyle. The supermodel and philanthropist told us she is devoted to bringing eco-conscious practices to her life, from conserving water to buying organic food. \"Sustainability in fashion is not just about the design and production of the clothes,\" she says. \"It's also about our actions once we have bought them. Wear your clothes for as long as possible, and when you are finished with them, recycle. Never throw them away, even if they are worn and old, they can be made into something new.\" The full collection will be available starting April 20 at stores worldwide and on hm.com . As an added bonus, H&M’s new Conscious Exclusive Collection will also include options for kids as well as an Conscious Exclusive fragrance made from organic oils.
