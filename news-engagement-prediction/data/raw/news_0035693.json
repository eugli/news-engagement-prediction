Anitere Flores and others discuss school testing bill in Tallahassee on Wednesday. Gray Rohrer/Orlando Sentinel Sen. Anitere Flores and others discussing school testing bill. Sen. Anitere Flores and others discussing school testing bill. (Gray Rohrer/Orlando Sentinel) Leslie Postal and Gray Rohrer ) would not eliminate any state exams, as some educators have urged, however.\nBut lawmakers, who spoke in front of a sign that read “a path to fewer, better tests,” said they would still make testing less intrusive. \n“Teachers are frustrated. They feel like they’re having to cram for a test, they’re having to teach to a test,” said Sen. Anitere Flores , R-Miami, the Senate sponsor. \nFlores said the goal was to introduce “some common-sense changes” into state testing rules. \nIn addition to pushing most testing to the end of the school year, the bills also would require the state to provide student scores and test data to teachers within a week, so they could see where their students shined or struggled. The student score reports, which would go to parents as well, would have to be in an “easy-to-read understandable format.” \nCurrent score reports show parents how students did compared with others in their school, district and state and how they did on broad sections, such as “key ideas and details” on the language arts test. But they do not, as the legislation would require, point out “areas of strength and areas in need of improvement.” \nThe bills also would require a study to determine whether the ACT or SAT could be used for high school testing in place of Florida exams. \nThat idea has been pushed for the past two years, first by Seminole County educators and later by some state senators. A bill that would have scrapped state tests in favor of the two college admissions exams died in the Florida Legislature last year, however. \nAmy Lockhart, chairman of the Seminole County School Board, stood with lawmakers in Tallahassee as they discussed their bills at a news conference Wednesday. \nThe changes would give “teachers more time to teach and students more time to learn,” she said in a statement. \nThe bills are not as sweeping as the testing changes proposed by some school superintendents and suggested by Sen. David Simmons , R-Altamonte Springs, chairman of the Senate’s education budget panel. \nThey said they want the state to eliminate some of its end-of-course exams — mostly taken by high school students — and to allow school districts to give paper-and-pencil exams instead of online ones but have not filed legislation yet. \nFlorida has moved mostly to computer-based exams in recent years. Those online exams provide scores back more quickly but disrupt classes more too. That’s because schools can give everyone a paper-and-pencil test at the same time but can schedule only as many online tests as they have available computers. \nThe sponsors of these bills said online exams mean that tests can be scored quickly and that helpful score reports can be then be quickly returned to teachers and parents. \nThey said their proposals were devised in response to complaints they heard from constituents. But they are not an effort to back away from Florida’s test-based, school accountability system or an acknowledgement that the state has gone overboard with student testing. \n“We all believe in accountability, we all believe that we have to have quality education and we have to measure it,” said Rep. Manny Diaz Jr., R-Hialeah. “But at the end of the day we have to have an honest conversation about what we’re doing.” \nDiaz and Rep. Chris Sprowls, R-Palm Harbor are the House sponsors. \nThe state’s stable of standardized exams includes the Florida Standards Assessments — a series of language arts and math exams for students in third grade through high school — plus several science and social studies tests given to students in certain grades or courses. \nIn 2016, Florida students took more than 3 million exams online and about 650,000 on paper. \nlpostal@orlandosentinel.com 407-420-5273 \n» Caption Orange County students will have limited transfer choices \nParents looking transfer their child to another public school in Orange County will have limited choices. \nParents looking transfer their child to another public school in Orange County will have limited choices.
