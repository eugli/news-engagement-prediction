BEVAN READ/FAIRFAX NZ \nThe 19-year-old world No 1 has made several changes ahead of the 2017 LPGA season. \nKo said she had been working with Gilchrist, who also coaches Thai star Ariya Jutanugarn, for the past month and he was the only coach she had turned to since her split with David Leadbetter last year. \nREAD MORE: * Garcia takes out Dubai Desert Classic \nJutanugarn is ranked No 2 and had a brilliant 2016, winning the British Open and beat Ko to the LPGA Player of the Year and Race to the CME Globe titles but the 19-year-old Kiwi said both having the same coach would not be a problem. BEVAN READ/FAIRFAX NZ \nKo spoke to media for almost half an hour at the Windross Farm club south of Auckland on Wednesday. \n\"Just because we are in that position in the rankings it doesn't mean she hates me and I hate her. \n\"She is one of the sweetest players on tour and a lot of the girls would agree to that. \n\"It just shows how good a coach Gary is. Shanshan Feng, Paula Creamer, there is a bunch of us that work with Gary, they all trust him and enjoy working with him. \n\"It's not necessarily a rivalry thing, it just gives me confidence he's a great coach and this will be good going forward.\" Ad Feedback \nBack home for several days before heading to Australia for the first event of her 2017 campaign, Ko was speaking at the Windross Farm course south of Auckland, where the New Zealand Women's Open will be a stop on the LPGA schedule in late September. \nKo was also attending the Halberg Awards in Auckland on Thursday night, where she was yet again up for New Zealand sportswoman of the year. \nAfter spending all of December on holiday in South Korea, her country of birth, Ko had been working with Gilchrist throughout January and said the partnership had so far been \"a lot of fun\". \n\"When I talked to the other players that are with Gary, they said he [keeps things] very simple and not very mechanical. That is the aspect I thought would be great. \n\"I tried a few lessons with him and I felt like it was very simple and he wouldn't rip my swing apart, and that is really important. \n\"I'm not too worried about the changes. It almost takes me back to three years ago when I was a rookie ... everything is new and you are excited. I feel like I've learned about my game and it has been a great off-season.\" \nKo added that the pair both being based in Florida was also a factor, given the limited time players have to work with their coaches. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T06:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:50:54.970+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
