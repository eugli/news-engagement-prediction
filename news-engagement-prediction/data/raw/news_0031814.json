In 2016, Deadpool finally made its long-awaited theatrical release on this date, and fans are feeling sentimental about the mercenary’s popularity. Of course, the raunchy R-rated film took the world by storm as it grossed millions of dollars despite its mature rating. And, now, Ryan Reynolds himself is taking a moment to commemorate Deadpool’s anniversary with a touching photo. \nOver on Instagram, the actor posted a picture to honor Deadpool on its one year anniversary. As you might have guessed, it’s a fairly NSFW piece of work. \n“One year ago today, we released Deadpool. And the gift of a one year anniversary, is of course, paper,” Reynolds captioned the photo. \nIn image, fans can see that Deadpool has taken over packaging for some toilet paper. The brand comes with 60% more sheets coated with hemorrhoid cream. Known as Deadpool Ultra Soft, the tissue absorbs up to $240 worth of pudding, and the ad is not talking about the edible kind. And, if you were hoping the brand was two-ply, then you can think ago. Instead, the tissue has a “sandpaper” texture that promises to remove more...whatever. \nThe image’s wacky sense of humor is just the flavor fans of Deadpool should be used to. The movie was unapologetic with how it approached jokes, and Wade Wilson was all too happy to press taboo buttons with his quips. It was the film’s brazen humor that made it an worldwide success, and Deadpool’s writers said the studio approved the dicey film because it was too over-the-top for Marvel or Disney to compete with.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:52:13.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
