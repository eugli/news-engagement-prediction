Credit Raymond Boyd/Getty Images Francis Henry Taylor, a director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the 1940s and ’50s, described the museum as no less than “the midwife of democracy.” But officials at the Minneapolis Institute of Art , that city’s grand encyclopedic museum, probably didn’t bargain on a version of democracy as messy as the one they got on Saturday, when a Trump-related protest turned violent and made its way into the galleries, with fists and feet flying near artworks. The confrontation began when a large group of organized protesters, holding banners identifying themselves as the Industrial Workers of the World, held a rally in front of the museum, apparently to condemn the Trump administration’s plans for more aggressive immigration enforcement and deportations. Kaywin Feldman, the museum’s director, said security camera footage showed two or three men apparently engaging in an argument with the protesters. When the men went into the museum, anti-Trump protesters followed them inside. Two witnesses told The Star Tribune of Minneapolis that they had heard the men who agitated the anti-Trump protesters yelling neo-Nazi provocations, and that one of the men was wearing a neo-Nazi or white-nationalist symbol on his jacket. Attempts to reach the witnesses by phone and social media on Monday were unsuccessful. But Ms. Feldman said no such symbols were visible in the security footage, and she did not have any information from the museum’s security guards about what the men had been yelling. \nAdvertisement “We don’t have an indication of who they were,” she said. “But it was obvious that the I.W.W. fellows were going through the galleries looking for them, for their opponents.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
