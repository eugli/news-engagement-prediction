The Vampire Diaries spoilers for Season 8, Episode 15 show pictures of the long-absent Kelly Donovan , Matt’s mother. \nMore family drama for Matt, it seems. \nWe finally met Matt's father, who has played a large role this season as Peter Maxwell. We already knew that Vicki , who died back in Season 1, would return. And now Kelly Donovan is officially back, too. \nCheck out the spoiler-ific image of Kelly in the episode titled, “We're Planning a June Wedding.” \nAccording to the episode synopsis, the gang plans a quickie fake wedding to lure Cade to them. With his mom Kelly holding the microphone, a good theory is that the fake wedding will be Matt’s. \nHasn’t Matt been through enough? \nIt could be worse, though. Matt could have been the son of a succubus . \nLast we saw the non-supernatural-but-still-horrible Kelly Donovan all the way back in Season 1. Matt always acted as the grown-up in his relationship with his mother, as Kelly continually made poor life choices. \nOh, and Kelly also made out with both Matt’s BFF and his mostly enemy, Tyler Lockwood and Damon Salvatore . \nIt was the former incident with Tyler that caused Matt to finally pack up his mother’s things and tell her she should never come back to Mystic Falls. \nIn Season 6, Enzo told Matt that she was spotted in South Carolina, and her name has only been mentioned very rarely otherwise. \nSo what brings her back to Mystic Falls? \nWell now that the father of her child is back in the picture, she might have some things to say. And if her daughter Vicki comes back in some way, she’s going to want to be around to be a part of it. \nAnd maybe, just maybe, it could be a successful, positive reunion with Matt, who seriously deserves a happy ending . \nBut we never can really trust Kelly on that. \nThe Vampire Diaries Season 8 airs Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW. \nCheck out more of Wetpaint ’s coverage of The Vampire Diaries Season 8 below:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:31:30.905+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
