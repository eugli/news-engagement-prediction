I really can’t describe this feeling,” Thompson said, after the win.\n“I think it’s the biggest (moment) of my career. The summer’s been pretty good, but playing for your country is amazing, and getting us off to a 1-0 lead is even better.”\nTeam captain Lleyton Hewitt was extremely happy with Australia’s quick start to their Davis Cup campaign.\n“I’ve been around Davis Cup long enough to know you can’t take anything for granted,” Hewitt said.\n“Nick was fantastic today and was ultra professional in everything he did. ‘Thommo’ played a great match\n“Very happy to be 2-nil up.”\nmedia_camera Australian captain Lleyton Hewitt with Nick Kyrgios.\nKyrgios, who was fined US$5,500 for swearing and throwing his racquet after a stormy second round exit to Andreas Seppi at last month’s Australian Open, showed no such behaviour under the watchful eye of Australia captain Lleyton Hewitt.\nHe maintained his focus, kept his emotions in check and sent down 21 aces.\n“That’s my main weapon,” Kyrgios said. “I’m always trying to develop that part of my game. That’s what I’m aiming to do every match.”\nThe big-hitting Kyrgios overwhelmed the hapless Satral although the Australian needed six match points to finally put away the Czech.\nKyrgios said it wasn’t as easy to win against a rookie opponent as some expected.\n“I had a week in Miami (after the Australian Open) and flew back so I didn’t have that long to prepare -- about five days,” he told reporters.\n“There were some pre-match nerves. I haven’t played that many matches in 2017. “It’s never easy playing a guy you don’t know that well. He had nothing to lose.” Kyrgios improved his record to 5-3 in singles rubbers against Satral, who was making his Davis Cup debut.\nAustralia can wrap up the tie with victory in Saturday’s pivotal doubles through the pairing of John Peers and Sam Groth.\nDoubles specialist Peers is fresh off a Grand Slam title win at the Australian Open, while Groth reached the quarter-finals of the men’s doubles in Melbourne.\nCzech captain Jaroslav Navratil said former world number eight Radek Stepanek was in doubt for the doubles with an unspecified injury.\nDream debut for Thompson 1:09 Tennis: Jordan Thompson has made a dream start to his Davis Cup career, with a straight-sets win against which gave Australia a 1-NIL lead.\nFebruary 3rd 2017 3 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/sourceId/606742/ Dream debut for Thompson THE SCHEDULE\nSaturday (from midday AEDT)\nDoubles\nSam Groth/John Peers (AUS) v Zdnek Kolar/Radek Stepanek (CZE)\nSunday (from 11am AEDT)\nSingles\nNick Kyrgios (AUS) v Jiri Vesely (CZE)\nJordan Thompson (AUS) v Jan Satral (CZE)\nUPDATES\nOriginally published as Aussies flying after Day 1 v Czech Republic", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2017%2F02%2F02%2FDVU_TEN_KYRGIOS_STEPANEK_020217.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2017%2F02%2F03%2FDVU_20170302_TEN_THOMPSON_WON.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v2/origin:video_integrator.BpeGdjOTE6Eo6gaMicXwlbCy4CVPvsYy?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/tennis/davis-cup-live-australia-v-czech-republic-day-one-scores-schedule-updates/news-story/6437b085b45ec17b64303345978d25dd", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9efb00659b16ccd608c0a384c0476349?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/news/content/v2/origin:video_integrator.d2dGtkOTE6yrfCzpLiOXG-Te9s3xQDtY?t_product=video&t_template=../video/player", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/video/vjs/metros/build/player.css", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/6437b085b45ec17b64303345978d25dd?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/395ed6ae729a1e4606e8a98ad023f9a8?width=650"], "published": "2017-02-02T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:36:17.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
