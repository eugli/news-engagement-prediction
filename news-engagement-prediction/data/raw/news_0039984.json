You know, I think everybody gets the sweats and that uneasy feeling,” he said. \nHe was certain he was about to get a ticket for not having a front license plate. \nThe timing wasn’t great. \nAfter years of infertility and a recent miscarriage, the Blackmores had recently paid for a second round of IVF, in vitro fertilization. \n“We both really wanted a family,” said Blackmore. \nThe pair even travelled to the Czech Republic for the procedure in order to cut costs. \nNow Blackmore thought he’d be paying for a traffic ticket, too. \nThe officer cut him a break, though. \n“Seeing as how I’m not writing you a ticket maybe you can listen to me…” he said. \n“I thought, well, I’d just listen to him lecture me,” admits Blackmore. \nIt took a little while for the message to sink in. \n“As a parent, we also have to make sure that we’re a good role model, correct?” the officer told him. “And, seeing as you’re in that boat now, don’t you think it’s important you do the same?” \n“Whaaaat???” Blackmore replied. \nThe officer handed him a “Baby on Board” sign, and when Blackmore turned his head his wife, Michelle, was holding a positive pregnancy test. \n“I just knew I wanted to have a cool story to tell,” she said. \nNow they both have a good story and soon, someone else to one day share it with. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.)
