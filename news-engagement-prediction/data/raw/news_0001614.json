When she gets home, she and her husband Daniel relax by chasing their twin boys around the backyard. \nThe friends represent how young families make divergent choices on how and where to raise children in Melbourne. While the majority take the traditional route to affordable fringe suburbs, many are rethinking inner-city living. And both have their pros and cons: including an increasing strain on schools and childcare in those areas. \nDaniel Richter and Maria Torres Richter value having a big backyard for their twin 2-year-old boys Gabriel and Marcel.

The Wyndham baby boom saw Werribee Mercy Hospital deliver 3748 babies last year and already another 331 in January. The hospital increased monthly maternity bookings and employed extra staff to keep up. \nBirth rates are similarly high in Cardinia, Casey, Hume, Mitchell and Melton shires: “Those outer areas are generally where people go to buy a house, settle down and have kids,” demographer Glenn Capuano of .id said. “But Wyndham is probably the most affordable fringe housing in Melbourne at the moment.” \nAlthough the City of Melbourne has a low birthrate (a formulation based on the population’s fertility), it is witnessing its own mini boom, with the crude number of babies on the rise because simply more people are living there. The council is now one of the fastest growing. More people means more births. \nMelbourne’s population continues to explode from a combination of births as well as huge migration numbers.

But she says she still gets a reaction when people found out she is raising kids in a three-bedroom apartment. \n“But those people are usually from the suburbs and haven’t thought about it themselves,” she said. “I grew up in the suburbs and my parents were never happy there, suburban life is not for everyone.” \nYour view of Melbourne as a value for money proposition will depend on where you live.

Affordability and a good chance for capital growth were the other reasons she and her husband Daniel Richter, a real estate agent with Brian Mark, wanted to raise their kids in Werribee. \n“Before I had kids, my vision was that I would be closer to the city, but once I had babies, I just see now how important it is to for them to be outside in the grass,” she said. “The boys are toddlers so they’re always climbing things, I’m happy for them to have that traditional upbringing.” \nWerribee Mercy Hospital delivered 3748 babies last year.

If you apply that standard to a major growth area it would create a challenge for Melbourne retaining that reputation.” This week's must see listings", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T07:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:56:43.122+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
