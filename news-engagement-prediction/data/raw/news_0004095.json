One was a League Cup loss, that nobody will really mind, but the second was against title rivals Spurs and were it not for that defeat, Conte's team could be out of sight at the top of the Premier League. \nMauricio Pochettino is the only manager of a top six side to have figured out how to beat Chelsea 2.0 and the next to try is the coach who first forced Conte into his successful tactical change. \nSo how can Arsène Wenger get his team back in the title race? Adapt to Chelsea's weaknesses \nArsenal are notorious for not adjusting their tactics to their opponents but Wenger must do so for this match. Wenger has been guilty in seasons past of putting a team out and hoping for the best - as we have seen all too often, it doesn't work enough of the time. Babbello index premier league top 20 \nT he addition of a defensive midfielder alongside a deep lying playmaker in the midfield has helped in more recent games against tough opposition. Adopting a more direct, counter-attacking style against those teams has too, but for the most part, you know exactly how Arsenal will line up for any occasion. \nSpurs sprung a surprise on Conte by switching to a back three and matching Chelsea's formation during their 2-0 win. They focused play down the left, concentrating on taking advantage of Chelsea's only real defensive weakness: Victor Moses, for all the attacking good he does, is the equivalent of the Death Star's thermal exhaust port. Left: The Death Star's thermal exhaust port - it's only structural weakness. Right: Victor Moses' defensive positioning - Chelsea's only structural weakness \nM oses has been a revelation at right-midfield/right-wing-back but has not spent much of his career learning defensive positioning and at times his inexperience really shows. \nIn that Spurs match, Harry Kane played slightly left of centre, meaning he was César Azpilicueta and David Luiz's problem to deal with rather than simply Luiz's, who plays as the central defender. Dele Alli kept close to Kane on the left, keeping that pair of defenders busy, which meant Christian Eriksen could attract Gary Cahill's attention on the other side of defence. Average touch positions (90 min) \nW ith Danny Rose providing width and an attacking threat on the left wing, Mousa Dembélé also looked to attack down the same part of the pitch, almost as if Spurs were testing the electric fence with a stick to find out a vulnerable spot. \nTo cope with the pressure on the left, the team shifted over more to that side. Spurs responded by moving the ball to the other side to make the defence continually shift position and after 45 minutes of it, they got the opening they'd been looking for. Eriksen dropped slightly deeper, Moses didn't hold the defensive line, and the ball was played between Moses and Azpilicueta. \nChelsea wanted this aerial battle to be in the space between Azpilicueta and Luiz - two players who can head a ball. \nT he cross was perfectly placed and Ali headed his side into the lead on the stroke of half time. Spurs 1 - 0 Chelsea (Dele Alli, 45 + 1 min) \nS purs had either identified, or stumbled upon, Chelsea's weak point and took advantage again in the second half. \nF or the second goal, Eriksen was closer to the box but chose the exact same kind of cross - in between Azpilicueta and Moses. This time Azpilicueta played Alli onside with Moses also too deep, having followed the Spaniard's defensive line. \nThe build-up was the same. Spurs moved the ball quickly from side to side to make the Chelsea defence constantly readjust. And once they'd shifted over to Eriksen's side of the pitch, the cross was on. \nHere's Liverpool doing the exact same thing for their equaliser against Conte's team. \nO nce again, Moses doesn't readjust position quickly enough and fails to hold the offside line properly. \nW ith all possession but no penetration, Liverpool moved the ball from side to side until Chelsea were positioned more to one side of the pitch. James Milner snuck into space wide in the area and should have been Victor Moses' problem, but Chelsea had contracted and made their back five compact to limit space in the box. \nM ilner was then able to head back across the area and Wijnaldum took advantage of the disorganisation to score. \nBased on these few examples, you can bet that Olivier Giroud will start against Chelsea, with Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil operating in space slightly left of him. It's incredibly important then that Hector Bellerin is able to get as high up the pitch as possible on the right wing to give the right-sided midfield player in these passing moves - probably Theo Walcott or Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - the opportunity to hit this kind of pass into the area. Hit them on the counter-attack \nPlaying three at the back benefits Chelsea as much in attack as it does defence. With one less player at the back, another can be moved upfront, allowing that deadly trio of Diego Costa, Eden Hazard and Pedro to play together with a solid midfield behind. \nThe two wide forwards (Pedro and Hazard) operate in central areas, attacking through the middle. To give them space to have fun, the wide midfielders (Marcos Alonso and Moses) have to stay on either touchline and get forward quickly. \nThis leaves space in behind. \nIn defence, Luiz usually steps out to intercept players running at goal and the other two defenders split either side. \nA nd so if a team can win the ball deep in their own half and attack at speed, the back three can be left exposed. \nH ere, Liverpool win the ball deep in their own half and find Chelsea out of shape and vulnerable. Alonso is caught too high up the pitch, you can't even see Moses in that screengrab and both Nemanja Matic and N'Golo Kante have left the centre of the pitch exposed to Giorginio Wijnaldum's forward burst. They are just below Wijnaldum in that picture. Miss: Liverpool 0 - 1 Chelsea (Roberto Firmino, 49 min) \nT he defence is on the back foot and struggles to cope with Liverpool's speed of attack. As they try to get back into position, the ball is played into the box (again, it's from the right to the left) and Roberto Firmino should score. He doesn't, but he should. \nI t's a risky tactic, but giving Chelsea more of the ball might actually be the way to beat them. By drawing them towards your own goal and allowing Alonso and Moses to get into their attacking winger positions, Kante and Matic can be left horribly exposed. \nThe danger is obviously that Hazard and friends score while you let them do this but there is a little bit of evidence to support this theory as being sound. Give Chelsea the ball \nSpurs gave Chelsea lots of time on the ball and played them at their own game. When Conte's side lost the ball high up the pitch, Spurs attacked quickly and focused on getting the ball into the box from the right. \nSpurs 2 Chelsea 0 Possession: Spurs vs Chelsea \nA gainst Arsenal, Chelsea played the unsuccessful 4-2-4 sort of formation they'd used up to that point. The method of victory was the same. In the first half the Gunners drew them in and hit them on the counter, coming away with that 3-0 win. \nArsenal 3 Chelsea 0 Possession: Arsenal vs Chelsea \nF or West Ham 2 Chelsea 1, the winning team had a 47% - 53% share of the ball. It's re-occurring theme - Chelsea can be beaten if they aren't the team playing on the counter-attack. When they have more of the ball, they struggle to score. \nIf you try and keep possession yourself, like Pep Guardiola did, you end up being destroyed on the counter-attack. \nMan City 1 Chelsea 3 \nJ ose Mourinho's Man Utd found this out the hard way too. \nChelsea 4 Man Utd 0 \nT eams who give Chelsea more of the ball have been much closer to taking results away. \nMiddlesbrough 0 Chelsea 1 \nMiddlesbrough aren't exactly the greatest side the Premier League has ever seen but ran Chelsea close by giving them all the possession they could eat and sitting deep to hit them on the counter. Possession: Middlesbrough vs Chelsea \nC helsea won that game thanks to Diego Costa's quick thinking from a corner. Before the rammy in the box from that set piece, Conte's side had found it difficult to create and Aitor Karanka's team managed to get quite a few efforts on goal themselves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T15:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:37:02.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
