Don’t inject, but if you do, don’t share works with other people.\n– Forest Bank leaflet It also advises people to start ‘with a really small amount’, to ‘anticipate what could go wrong’, not to take too much or too often and not to take the drugs alone.\nAt the end it says:\nLook after people who have overdosed in the same way you would want them to look after you.\n– Forest Bank leaflet NPS is the official name for substances such as Spice, usually ‘synthetic cannabinoids’ that are smoked or snorted and until last year could be bought legally in shops across Greater Manchester. In April the government banned them.\nForest Bank’s leaflet appears to be giving outdated advice, however, suggesting they are still legal - by warning that some NPS ‘also contain illegal drugs’ and prisoners could therefore ‘be breaking the law without knowing it’.\nIt’s a regular event having to rush people to hospital. Every day there’s two or three.\n– Former prisoner He described seeing drones fly up to the windows of inmates, before prisoners ‘kicked the windows out and lifted the drugs into the cell’. Every few days a prison cherry picker patrols in the space between the prison wall and the fence to pick up drugs dropped by drones, he added.\nA second prisoner described the jail as ‘ruthless and lawless’, with Spice common currency and wardens unable to deal with the scale of the problem.\nIn October an investigation was launched after leaked footage revealed the violence and humiliation sparked by Spice use in Forest Bank - including naked prisoners pretending to be dogs .\nSodexo, the private firm that runs Forest Bank, has been asked to comment.\n Manchester", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:09:05.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
