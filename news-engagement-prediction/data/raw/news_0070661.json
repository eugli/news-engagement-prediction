When the pair met up for dinner in the summer, Graham told the younger man to be careful. O’Leary was perplexed. He said it was going great. ‘It’s going too well,’ Graham warned. ‘If you can’t repeat it, they’ll sack you.’ The next season, Leeds had a tilt at the title, eventually finishing third, and reached the semi-final of the UEFA Cup. Ranieri and Leicester have found things a lot harder this season and are in relegation danger The season after, O’Leary took them to the semi-final of the Champions League, losing to Valencia. In 2001-02, O’Leary finished fifth and Leeds qualified for the UEFA Cup. That summer he was sacked. It took a little while, but Graham was proved right. It only needed one season in which Leeds were perceived not to have progressed and all of O’Leary’s fine work counted for nothing. So it was for Ranieri. The mitigation for this most unholy dismissal is that Leicester were going down with him in charge. Yet a club need to be in the bottom three to get relegated and Leicester have not touched those depths once in this campaign. The owners may have thought that the drop into the Premier League basement was only a matter of time, but events can turn. At half-time in Seville on Wednesday, few gave Leicester a prayer. By the end of the match, they were a 1-0 home win in the return leg away from the Champions League quarter-final. Things change. After the game, Ranieri was said to be happier than he has been in months. He has been willing Jamie Vardy to score, believing his loss of form is purely down to confidence, and the striker obliged with his first goal since December 10. George Graham warned David O'Leary about the problems that occur from overachieving O'Leary enjoyed success at Leeds but was sacked when the club finished outside the top four That it came from a pass by the similarly out of sorts Danny Drinkwater was an added bonus. Ranieri was pleased with the resilience his players showed against a superior side, too, and hoped this would mark a corner turned. He had no inkling that he was finished at Leicester until the call came. Foolishly, Ranieri believed that to win the league title as such an outsider afforded him credit, that he would be allowed to see out the Champions League campaign and that the owners shared his conviction this season could be turned around. He was wrong. With the exception of Bob Bradley at Swansea, all Premier League managers sacked this season have one thing in common: at some stage in the last 12 months they did better than expected. Alan Pardew at Crystal Palace reached the FA Cup final, and only lost to Manchester United in extra time. Alan Pardew guided Crystal Palace to the FA Cup final but was sacked the following season Mike Phelan got off to the perfect start with Hull but was sacked when the side were in a slump Claude Puel has guided Southampton to the League Cup final Ranieri won the league. Francesco Guidolin took over Swansea two points from the relegation zone, and finished the season in 12th place, 10 points clear. Even Mike Phelan, at Hull, started brightly — winning his first three games, before losing to Manchester United in the last minute. Most had Hull down as relegation certainties, and by some distance, but come mid-October they were still 15th. On January 3, with Hull now exactly where they were expected to be, Phelan was sacked. Ranieri was able to raise a smile on Friday after being sacked by Leicester the night before On Sunday, Claude Puel will walk out at Wembley as the first Southampton manager since Gordon Strachan in 2003 to reach a major final. Big mistake. He could have kept Southampton nicely under the radar, selling the best players to their bigger rivals but in no danger of relegation. Safe as houses. After this, then what? As Ranieri considers what the hell just happened, it would appear the managerial landscape is changing. They used to pay the price for failure: now success is equally cursed. For those outside the established elite, with Ranieri’s sacking, we may be witnessing the death of real ambition.
