PUBLISHED: PUBLISHED: 22:01, Fri, Feb 24, 2017 GETTY Mass migration is a threat to the UK's state pensions, a report has claimed \nThe comprehensive paper - How the £30 billion cost of EU migration Imperils Pensions & Benefits - by the thinktank Global Britain has blown apart claims that the UK needs EU migration to support its pension system. \nInstead it reveals that cheap labour flooding in from the continent is causing \"an economic catastrophe\" for the UK which threatens the pension system. \nAnd the report suggests that leaving the EU and taking back control of British borders will provide the UK with “a £250 billion opportunity” in the next five years. Related articles Swedish PM’s swipe at EU as he hints crack down on freedom of movement \nThe new study comes in a week where new figures revealed that the annual net migration is still 273,000, a reduction of 49,000 from previous figures but almost three times the level the government promised to reduce the number to. \nThe latest Office of National Statistics (ONS) figures revealed that 268,000 EU citizens relocated to the UK in the year up to September 2016 with 74,000 of the incomers arriving from Romania and Bulgaria. \nThe latest figures have highlighted the continued strain to the Exchequer of low paid workers coming into the UK. GETTY The report claims that labour from the EU is causing an 'economic catastrophe' \nThe Global Britain report's author Bob Lyddon, a leading City analyst, points out that the annual net cost of Britain’s 3 million EU migrants is £31.5 billion based on official figures which show that the Government spends £10,500 per head. This figure is higher than I expected but it does not surprise me Tory MP, Craig Mackinlay \nHowever, he shows that only 2 million of them work contributing a mere £500 each in tax in average, a total of just £1 billion a year. \nThis includes negligible levels of National Insurance contributions which underpin the state pension. \nHe argues that the EU freedom of establishment rule combined with freedom of movement means “tax efficient” multinationals can flood the UK with cheap foreign labour but avoid paying money to the Treasury such as corporation tax. \nIn a damning indictment he says that the UK taxpayer is subsidising low paid jobs for foreign workers. \nMr Lyddon said: “It is a common misconception that our pensions and benefits are financed from a pool established by past taxes and national insurance contributions, when today’s pensioners and other benefit recipients are actually funded out of current taxes and public borrowing.” \nHe said it was “once true” that migrants helped fund the state pension pot, but warned that “the relationship has changed.” \nHe said: “This is due to the low levels of tax and National Insurance contributions from low paid migrants, instead of contributing to the funding of pensions and benefits their contributions will not be enough to fund what they are drawing down in public services and benefits now, and the UK’s liabilities for future pensions that they will be entitled to will grow rather than shrink.” \nIn previous Global Britain reports, Mr Lyddon has highlighted how Britain would get a £20 billion tax boost by ending Brussels rule and is exposed to £1.1 trillion of EU liabilities while it remains a member. Why these nations could leave the Eurozone Fri, February 24, 2017 Heavily indebted Greece has no acute shortage of money, but will need money again from the ongoing aid programme this summer. But Athens is not the only shaky candidate of the Eurozone. These are the other countries causing worries Play slideshow 1 of 7 \nMr Lyddon said: “ Brexit provides a perfect opportunity to both put a stop to the business models that drain money out of the UK into other EU Member States, and to introduce a migrant worker regime that works for the country as a whole and not just for the employer and employee. \n“A £30 billion annual cost is just under half the annual public spending deficit of £68.2 billion. \n\"Add the lost taxes due to EU ‘tax-efficient’ business models and our EU Member State cash contribution – each being £10 billion per annum – and we have £50 billion per annum as a potential saving.” \nHe added: “Over the same [five year] period as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has predicted a £60 billion ‘black hole’ in the public finances due to Brexit, there is actually a £250 billion opportunity. GETTY The study also suggests that taking control of UK borders will create a '£250 billion opportunity' \n\"What it needs is determination and leadership by the British government to grasp it.” \nTory South Thanet MP Craig Mackinlay, a member of the Commons Brexit committee, said: “This figure is higher than I expected but it does not surprise me. \n“It is the flip side of raising the threshold of income tax payments because it means that the tax paid by EU migrants in low paid jobs is very small or non-existent. \n“We still though have to pay all the benefits they are entitled too such as child benefit or housing benefit and then there is the massive infrastructure costs caused by our communities expanding.” GETTY The report was created by think tank Global Britain \nUkip pointed out that the report comes just days after Brexit Secretary David Davis said mass EU immigration could continue for many years after the UK leaves the EU. \nThe party’s immigration spokesman John Bickley said: “Bob Lyndon's damning report blows apart the myth perpetuated by the established Parties that EU migration benefits the UK economy. \n“Uncontrolled cheap labour from the EU benefits big business at the expense of landing ordinary taxpayers with a whopping and unsustainable pensions bill.” \nThe Government has promised to prioritise ending free movement from the EU but fears have been raised that it will allow it to continue for five years after Article 50 is triggered adding to the burden of the British taxpayer. \nMeanwhile Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have fiercely defended uncontrolled immigration from the EU and have vowed to allow it to continue unfettered.
