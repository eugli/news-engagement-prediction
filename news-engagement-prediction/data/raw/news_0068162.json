The EPA under President Barack Obama said the rule protects waters that are next to rivers and lakes and their tributaries \"because science shows that they impact downstream waters.\"\nA White House spokeswoman did not immediately comment.\nTrump is also expected to issue other environmental executive orders as early as next week, including ordering a reversal of the Obama administration's clean power plant rule and instructing the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management to lift a ban on new coal mining leases on federal lands.\nEPA administrator Scott Pruitt told The Wall Street Journal last week that he planned to quickly withdraw the clean power plant and WOTUS rules. \"Thereâ€™s a very simple reason why this needs to happen: Because the courts have seriously called into question the legality of those rules,\" Pruitt told the newspaper.\nWithdrawing the water and power plant rules will take time to meet regulatory requirements and will likely face court challenges from some Democratic state attorneys general and environmental groups.\n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Leslie Adler)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T04:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:49:44.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
