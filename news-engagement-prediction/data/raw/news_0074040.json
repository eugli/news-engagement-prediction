By Matthew Jacobs \nNot only is Meryl Streep the most decorated American actor or actress, with a record-setting 20 Oscar nominations. She’s also queen of the award show reaction shot. Whether responding to her category’s announcement or cheering on a telecast’s proceedings, Streep is the most GIF-worthy celebrity at any of Hollywood’s prestige gatherings. Here are 12 of the best, ranked. 12 2009: The Loren YouTube That was the year the Oscars brought out actors to deliver monologues about each nominee. She's mouthing, \"Thank you, Sophia.\" (As in Loren.) 11 1980: The Hair Swoop YouTube Meryl is very good at playing coy. 10 2014: The \"I Get It, I'm Good\" YouTube Streep and co-star Julia Roberts were laughing at Tina Fey and Amy Poehler's Golden Globe monologue, in which Fey joked, \"Meryl Streep, so brilliant in 'August: Osage County,' proving that there are still great parts in Hollywood for Meryl Streeps over 60.\" 9 2007: The Anonymous Wave YouTube Who got the lucky salute during this Best Actress reel? 8 1983: The Chin Stroke YouTube She could feel a win coming on. (It was for \"Sophie's Choice.\") 7 2014: The \"Oh, I Didn't See You There, Camera\" YouTube 6 1988: The \"Bravo!\" YouTube She was blowing a kiss to Best Actress winner Cher, who said, \"And I also would like to thank Mary Louise Streep, who I feel so unbelievable that I did my first movie with her and now I was nominated with her, and I feel really thankful.\" 5 2003: The \"Who, Me?\" YouTube This was Streep's fourth Golden Globe win. 4 1982: The Hair Swoop, Part 2 YouTube This was more of a flummoxed ruffle. Gotta get creative by your third nomination. 3 2012: The \"Who, Me?,\" Part 2 YouTube This was Streep's eighth Golden Globe win. 2 1999: The Gwyneth YouTube In the requisite thanking-of-the-fellow-nominees, teary Best Actress winner Gwyneth Paltrow said, \"And the greatest one who ever was, Meryl Streep -- I don't feel very deserving of this in your presence.\" Meryl was shook. 1 2014: The Ultimate Meryl YouTube She cheered on Patricia Arquette's equal-pay speech while seated next to J.Lo.
