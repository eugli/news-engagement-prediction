Brandi Glanville is a lady in love. The former Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star stepped out Thursday night in Los Angeles at OK Magazine’s Pre-GRAMMY Party in Los Angeles, bringing along her boyfriend of five months, businessman DJ Friese. “This is his first time on the carpet!” Brandi announced to photographers before the couple gave their first joint interview to ET. “He's the girl in the relationship,” Brandi joked, admitting she doesn’t remember all the details of their romance. “He knows everything that I don't know.” “I’m the talkative one,” DJ added. The pair confessed it was love at first swipe: They met on Tinder! And, yes, they’ve said, “I love you.” “All the good stuff,” DJ said, before Brandi threw her hand over his mouth. “Oh my god!” she exclaimed. “This is why I have a Xanax in my purse … I’m very nervous.” WATCH: Brandi Glanville on Co-Parenting With Eddie Cibrian Brandi admitted she’s protective of DJ, because this is her first serious relationship since her 2010 divorce from Eddie Cibrian. It’s serious enough that DJ has met Brandi and Eddie’s sons, 13-year-old Mason and 9-year-old Jake. “Everything’s been very good,” DJ told ET. “She’s very happy. We’re having a great time.” Brandi is also having a great time competing on My Kitchen Rules . For more about her time on the Fox show , check out the video below.
