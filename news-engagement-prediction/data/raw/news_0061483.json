We will examine what its impact is on claimants and those local bodies which deal with them, and what Government needs to do to ease the pressure on those worst affected.\"", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7U09laQ3Yq2JYreXhqOUgw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/the_independent_577/e2e9749d210699d2d1ea66bd34e264b6", "http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/work-and-pensions-committee/news-parliament-2015/universal-credit-re-launch-16-17/&quot;", "http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/work-and-pensions-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/universal-credit-progress-16-17/", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dwp-punishing-the-working-poor-with-sanctions-in-new-universal-credit-system-a6985461.html&quot;", "https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmworpen/549/549.pdf", "http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/work-and-pensions-committee/news-parliament-2015/universal-credit-re-launch-16-17/", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/07/universal-credit-flaws-pushing-claimants-towards-debt-and-eviction-warning?platform=hootsuite&quot;", "http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/work-and-pensions-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/universal-credit-progress-16-17/&quot;", "https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201516/cmselect/cmworpen/549/549.pdf&quot;", "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/feb/07/universal-credit-flaws-pushing-claimants-towards-debt-and-eviction-warning?platform=hootsuite", "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dwp-punishing-the-working-poor-with-sanctions-in-new-universal-credit-system-a6985461.html"], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:09:45.552+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
