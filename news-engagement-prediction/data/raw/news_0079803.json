Password: Cloudpets \nThe website NetworkWorld reports that the firm denied voice data had been stolen. \nTroy Hunt wrote on his blog that the voice recordings were stored in the cloud and the database, which was left exposed on the net, reveals their exact location. \nHe also expressed concern that there were no password rules at all, meaning lots of people had selected passwords that were extremely easy to crack. \n\"Because there were no rules, lots of people created bad passwords,\" he told the BBC. \n\"I did an exercise and found it was really easy to create them. Lots of people were using the password Cloudpets because that's what people do.\" \nThere appeared to be around 820,000 accounts visible. \nBoth Mr Hunt and British security researcher Ken Munro said the toy showed similar vulnerabilities to the Cayla doll, an internet-connected toy that was found to be easily breached and could even be hacked to spy on its owners. Media caption Rory Cellan-Jones sees how Cayla, a talking child's doll, can be hacked to say any number of offensive things. \nGerman watchdog the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has now advised parents who own a Cayla doll to destroy it. \nLike Cayla, there is no Pin number required to sync CloudPets with other devices, Ken Munro explained. \n\"If you have a CloudPets bear, switch it off,\" he said. \n\"It might be a good idea for people to try to delete their accounts - it's possible that the recorded data might go. \n\"Try to remember what password you set for the account - and if you used it anywhere else, change it.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T20:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:31:58.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
