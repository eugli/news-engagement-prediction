(ABC News: Alkira Reinfrank) \nNSW RFS Inspector Ben Shepherd said people should wait until instructed to return to their properties. \n\"There is the risk of downed powerlines. We haven't had lives lost, we don't want accidents to happen with people trying to work out if their home is there,\" he said. 'Touch wood, our house is still there' \nMichael Martin, who owns a home on Widgiewa Road, spoke to the ABC before being allowed to return to his property. \nHe was hopeful that his home was still standing. \n\"We haven't been home, we've just been listening to the news and pictures on the net … touch wood, our house is still there. We've just got to wait and see,\" he said. \nMr Martin said his daughter was the only person at home when the fire began. \n\"She only had a ute so she couldn't put all the dogs in with her, so we got her out first,\" he said. \n\"We came back in later and eventually got through … just so we could get down and get the dogs and a few photos out of the house. That's all we took with us.\" \nHe said as he rounded up the dogs, he could see the fire approaching. \n\"It was just coming up on the other side of the hill … black clouds were coming so we didn't even have time to load anything else really,\" he said. Containment lines consolidated in 'pretty bad' conditions \nAt 8:00am (AEDT) the fire was about 80 per cent contained. \nFirefighters hope they will manage to get around the entire perimeter of the blaze by tonight. \nRain in the area this morning bought some relief to firefighters, but also put crews on alert for vehicles becoming bogged.

(ABC News: Nick Haggarty) \nSpeaking from the fire control centre in Queanbeyan, NSW RFS spokesman James Morris told ABC Radio Canberra the fire was not under control yet, but crews had done well overnight. \n\"The night guys have worked really hard in some pretty bad conditions out there, to be able to consolidate those containment lines,\" he said. \nMr Morris said the fire was expected to grow again today — but not significantly. Photo: The fire quickly gathered speed and ferocity on Friday. (ABC News: Nick Haggarty) \n\"Hopefully it won't grow too much more,\" he said. \n\"Given the conditions that are predicted today, we shouldn't see anything too extreme coming from the fire ground today.\" \nMr Morris said fixed and rotary wing aircraft would be used in firefighting efforts today. \nHe said larger aerial units would only be used if necessary. \nThe fire alert level has been downgraded to advice, however residents at Hoskinstown, Rossi and Forbes Creek were instructed to keep monitoring the situation. About 90 fires burning across NSW \nAdam Morgan from the Bureau of Meteorology predicted a change in conditions would aid firefighters. \n\"As we head into the weekend we're likely to see the winds continue to ease,\" he said. \nEmergency shelters have been set up in nearby Bungendore and Queanbeyan. \nThere are around 80 fires burning across the NSW, with the RFS saying around 29 were uncontained. \nAreas effected by the total fire ban today include Narrabri, Walgett, Moree Plains and the Warrumbungle region in the north west of the state.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:11:55.172+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
