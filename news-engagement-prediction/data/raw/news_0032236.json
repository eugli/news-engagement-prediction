Most of us are. Let this wonderful photo from the Rolex 24 get your through your tough times. Advertisement \nThis weekend’s wallpaper comes from Mason Bleasdell and features the No. 67 Ford GT entry from the Rolex 24 at Daytona International Speedway, accented by the blanket of nightfall that makes these race photos so beautiful every year. That being said, you’re probably too busy staring at the photo to even read this. \nThe No. 67 team ended the day—literally, the 24-hour day of racing—in 27th spot overall and 10th in its class. Meanwhile, the Cadillac prototype dream team of Jeff Gordon, Jordan Taylor, Ricky Taylor and Max Angelelli won in the overall standings at Daytona. If you want to see other great photos from the race, go check out our guy Kurt Bradley’s huge gallery right here .
