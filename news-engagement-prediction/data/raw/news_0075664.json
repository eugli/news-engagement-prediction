His praise of the race-conscious horror film, which topped the box office on its opening weekend , is so high that he apparently bought out all the tickets for Sunday's (Feb. 26) showings at a local theater to give people a chance to see it at no charge. \n\"DID I NOT TELL YALL #GETOUT WAS INCREDIBLE!! BEST FILM ACROSS ANY GENRE IN AWHILE GO SEE IT TODAY!\" the rapper tweeted. \"I bought all the tickets to #GetOut at Chatham Theatre on 87th Just pull up with ID and enjoy the movie.\" \nAs pointed out by Pitchfork , the movie theater's website shows the 5:30, 8:00 and 10:30 p.m. showings of Get Out are sold out. \n\"All day guys, come thru! Bring whoever, it's free I just want you to see it on 87th. There's a few more showings today!\" he wrote. \"It's already bussin, I just left and might have to come back for a later showing!!\" DID I NOT TELL YALL #GETOUT WAS INCREDIBLE!!
