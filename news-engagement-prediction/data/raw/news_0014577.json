Throughout his 25-year Hall of Fame career, Henderson was infamous for referring to himself in the third person. It was one of the many quirks that made him a legendary player with the Oakland Athletics.\nWhen it came time to honor Henderson’s excellent playing career, the Athletics didn’t have to think too hard about the perfect tribute.\nAnnounced: A’s will name the Coliseum field “Rickey Henderson Field.” Henderson will also serve as a Special Assistant to the President. pic.twitter.com/wVPx6n8SVT\n— Oakland A’s ⚾️ (@Athletics) February 6, 2017\nYou read that right. The A’s are going to rename the field at the Coliseum after Henderson. A dedication ceremony will be held on opening night. After that, the field at the Coliseum will be known as “Rickey Henderson Field.” He’s also joining the organization as a special assistant to the team president.

(Getty Images/Focus On Sports) More Henderson may be the first to receive the honor, but we’re guessing he won’t be the last. It would be surprising to see other teams steal the idea from the A’s moving forward. Before you know it, the Boston Red Sox will be playing games on David Ortiz Field.\n[ Newsletter: Get 5 great stories from the Yahoo Sports blogs in your inbox every morning! ]\nWhen that happens, we’re guessing Henderson will be OK with that. Rickey’s made a career of being a trailblazer.\nMore MLB coverage from Yahoo Sports:\n– – – – – – –\nChris Cwik is a writer for Big League Stew on Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
