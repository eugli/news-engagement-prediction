I was surprised how all that energy got me totally addicted to watching the shows.” Sula took in two shows—Dion Lee and Jenny Packham—which reflected the actress’s taste for international labels. “I enjoyed the elegant cuts of Jenny Packham and [the] edge of Dion Lee,” said Sula. “It was so amazing to get to meet the designers [and] my favorite part was getting to see it all for the first time.” But did anyone elude the rising star? “I have a girl crush on the captivating Jourdan Dunn,” admitted Sula, adding, “but my [designer] crush has to be everything Zac Posen.” As for her front row wardrobe, Sula is all about prim practicality. “There are some lovely Grey Jason Wu outfits I have that always make me feel very stylish but simple. A good pair of boots paired with my vintage Max Mara coat, and comfortable and stylish Via Spiga Mary Jane heels.” Anything still on her Fashion Week hit list? “I heard Marc Jacobs’s show is pretty spectacular. Hopefully, I will be able to go one of these days.” Recommended For You", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T02:49:41.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
