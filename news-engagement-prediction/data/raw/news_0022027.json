(Jan. 19, 2017) Wochit After cutting about 500 field-based jobs, Eli Lilly looks to eliminate 200 R&D jobs from its workforce. Buy Photo Eli Lilly and Co. is headquartered in Downtown Indianapolis. (Photo: Joe Vitti/The Star file photo) Buy Photo \nJust a few weeks after announcing it will eliminate about 500 jobs after the failure of a drug to treat Alzheimer's, Lilly USA said about 200 more jobs, these in research and development, are on the chopping block. \nThe Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical giant will offer a \"voluntary reallocation program\" to many of its employees, with an eye toward cutting about 200 positions globally, the company said in an email. \nThe cuts account for less than 3 percent of Lilly's research and development workforce worldwide. According to its website, the company has about 9,000 employees doing research and development. \nWhile declining to elaborate, the company said in the statement it will also be hiring in certain areas. \n\"Lilly is focusing its investment in new R&D capabilities to ensure portfolio sustainability,\" the statement said. \"We plan to increase our investment and hire in strategic areas, including molecule-making capabilities, immunology and Alzheimer's disease, across our U.S. research sites later this year.\" \nLate last year, the company reported disappointing results from the trial of a drug that aimed to halt the progression of Alzheimer's disease. After that, the company said it would close its Integrated Health Partners/Cardiovascular Account Specialists department, part of its Bio-Medicine Business Unit. \nThe company said about 485 people would be laid off as a result of that, 75 of them based in Indianapolis. \n  Shari Rudavsky at (317) 444-6354.
