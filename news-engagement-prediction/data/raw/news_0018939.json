The strategy to solving molarity problems is fairly simple. This outlines a straightforward method to calculate molarity of a solution.The key to calculating molarity is to remember the units of molarity: moles per liter. Find the number of moles of the solute dissolved in liters of solution. Sample Molarity Calculation \nTake the following example:Calculate the molarity of a solution prepared by dissolving 23.7 grams of KMnO 4 into enough water to make 750 mL of solution.This example has neither moles or liters needed to find molarity. Find the number of moles of the solute first.To convert grams to moles, the molar mass of the solute is needed. From the periodic table : Molar mass of K = 39.1 gMolar mass of Mn = 54.9 gMolar mass of O = 16.0 gMolar mass of KMnO 4 = 39.1 g + 54.9 g + (16.0 g x 4)Molar mass of KMnO 4 = 158.0 gUse this number to convert grams to moles . \ncontinue reading below our video Test Your General Science Knowledge moles of KMnO 4 = 23.7 g KMnO 4 x (1 mol KMnO 4 /158 grams KMnO 4 )moles of KMnO 4 = 0.15 moles KMnO 4 Now the liters of solution is needed. Keep in mind, this is the total volume of the solution, not the volume of solvent used to dissolve the solute. This example is prepared with 'enough water' to make 750 mL of solution.Convert 750 mL to liters.Liters of solution = mL of solution x (1 L/1000 mL)Liters of solution = 750 mL x (1 L/1000 mL)Liters of solution = 0.75 LThis is enough to calculate the molarity.Molarity = moles solute/Liter solutionMolarity = 0.15 moles of KMnO 4 /0.75 L of solutionMolarity = 0.20 MThe molarity of this solution is 0.20 M.
