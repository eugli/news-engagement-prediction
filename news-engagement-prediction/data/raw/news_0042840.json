Find out how here. ETNZ will cycle in the America's Cup © Hamish Hooper/ ETNZ By Corinna Halloran on 21 February 2017 \nLast week the sailing world was turned upside down and everything we ever knew about the sport became obsolete with one viral (but sneaky) video . \nIn all fairness though, we really shouldn’t be surprised – after all, the America’s Cup has a track record of changing the sport. \nBut, Emirates Team New Zealand may have just taken the cake. Their race boat for June’s America’s Cup will use cycle grinding technology. \nLong story short – the sailors will be cycling around the racecourse. \nLonger story even shorter – move over sailors, we now have ‘cyclors.’ © Hamish Hooper/ ETNZ \nIt’s all about power \nIn theory, it is 100 percent logical. It’s almost so logical that if you asked a cyclist: 'what would be the more efficient way of grinding – legs or arms?' They’d probably smack their forehead and say: ‘duh, legs.’ However, with a team of engineers whose brains would knock the red socks off your feet, ETNZ was able to design and implement the impossible. \nETNZ Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Shoebridge said: “It’s just obvious when you look at the size of legs versus the size of arms. But it’s a lot more complicated because you use pedaling in a very different way to power the hydraulic pumps.” \nThat said, what exactly are the grinders doing? They’re powering hydraulics, which then trims the sail and wing, as well as raises and lowers the dagger boards. \nGrinders (sorry, 'cyclors') are the power – they are the engine. \nBy the numbers, an Olympic cyclist’s output is 500 watts whereas an elite grinder’s wattage is 250-300. According to Sail-World.com the full peloton of cyclors provides over 160 percent more energy. A post shared by @emiratesteamnz on Feb 16, 2017 at 10:53am PST \nThe answer is yes \nThere’s a myriad of questions around this new venture, but there are a few questions that are on everyone’s mind. \nDo the sailors clip in? Yes \nYou bet – every day is leg day. Training also includes regular 200km rides. \nDid ETNZ bring cyclists into the team? Oh yes. With a team of over 90, you can bet your bottom dollar that pro-cyclists and Olympians were included in the team. In fact, the sailing peloton includes Olympic Bronze medalist, Simon Van Velthooven . \nMoreover, ETNZ decided to design the boat with sailing company Southern Spars that “just built the carbon cycling wheels for the New Zealand Olympic team,” according to Shoebridge. \nOk but does it work? Of course ETNZ wants this million dollar bet to work, however it has yet to be tested on the water against another boat. \n'Leg day' is every day © Hamish Hooper/ ETNZ \nA week in and the spirits still seem to be pretty high. \n”The first day of sailing was always going to be a bit of an eye opener,” (skipper) Glen Ashby said. “However, it was quite an amazing feeling to be able to pull manoeuvres off. The first boat to ever do a foiling tack in the world with the guys on pedals!” Regardless, the fact is that's pretty special. \nEmirates Team New Zealand have always set sailing levels higher than high – after all they brought foiling to the America’s Cup back in 2013 – and it is ever the case now. Only time (and the pedal power) will tell. Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:02:39.752+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
