Tuesday was the exchange website’s busiest day ever, with nearly 3 million page views.\nThe surge in enrollment came despite vows by President Trump and Congressional Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which created the program.\n\"New Yorkers now have access to affordable health insurance coverage, giving hundreds of thousands of previously uninsured individuals economic and healthcare security,” said Donna Frescatore, executive director of the exchange.\nRepublican lawmakers starting to worry about ‘Trumpcare’ \nThe enrollment figures included more than 2.4 million people who enrolled in Medicaid, 242,880 who signed up for private insurance plans, and 299,214 children qualified for the state’s Child Health Plus program.\nAnother 665,234 people signed up for the Essential Plan, a state-run and federally funded coverage plan for people making up to twice the federal poverty level. Enrollment in the Essential Plan jumped 75% from a year ago.\nBill Hammond, director of health policy for the Empire Center, said the Health Department’s numbers are somewhat misleading because the bulk of the enrollments came from Medicaid. The number of users who signed up for private insurance actually dropped nearly 11% from a year ago, he added.\n“That to me is a sign of trouble with a private part of the exchange,” Hammond said.\nSend a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:07:52.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
