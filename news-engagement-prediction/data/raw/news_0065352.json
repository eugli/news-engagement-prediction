(Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images) Take the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, D.C., which started Wednesday. For years, the event has served as a window on the issues, rhetoric and personalities that hold the most power with conservative voters at a given time. This year, the panels and speakers reflect Trump’s “America First” policy priorities, nationalist energy and taste for showmanship. As our colleagues wrote , it’s a sharp turn from the “libertarian flavor” of the conference during Obama’s presidency.\nOn the other hand, Republican lawmakers are facing strong opposition from voters energized by their opposition to Trump.\nAmericans are flocking to Republican legislators' town hall meetings with questions about health care, immigration and more. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post) Take the town halls held this week by Republicans like Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. David Brat (R-Va.) . At the height of the tea party movement, GOP lawmakers were just as likely to receive pushback at these constituent events from conservative critics — people seeking to push them further to the right — as they were from liberal ones. Now, those lawmakers are being hit with tough questions on issues like Obamacare from people who call themselves the Trump “resistance.” \nIt’s not an easy balancing act. As our colleague wrote , “if Republicans hope to survive … they must figure out how to work with Trump while navigating constituent anger about his more controversial policies.”\nOFFICIALS REVOKE PROTECTIONS FOR TRANSGENDER STUDENTS \nIt’s official: The Trump administration has rolled back federal protections for transgender students who want to use the restroom that matches their gender identity.\nUnder President Obama, schools were told that “prohibiting transgender students from using facilities that align with their gender identity violates federal anti-discrimination laws,” our colleagues wrote.\nThe Trump administration on Feb. 22 revoked federal protections for transgender students in public schools who sought to use the restrooms that match their gender identity. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post) Late Wednesday, officials with the Departments of Education and Justice notified the Supreme Court that they are ordering U.S. public schools to disregard that guidance.\nTILLERSON, KELLY TO MEET WITH MEXICAN PRESIDENT \nCan the Trump administration lower tensions with Mexico over trade, the proposed border wall and new U.S. immigration policies? Two top officials are about to find out .\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is welcomed by U.S. ambassador Roberta Jacobson in Mexico City on Wednesday. (Carlos Barria/Reuters) Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly are in Mexico this week for talks with President Enrique Peña Nieto about “how to move forward in day-to-day relations,” our colleague wrote .\nThe trip comes after a series of public disagreements between the two sides, including a “heated volley of tweets” between Trump and Peña Nieto last month over who should pay for a border wall.\nINVESTIGATIONS COULD SUBPOENA TRUMP TAX RETURNS \nCould this be the way we finally get a look at Trump’s tax returns?\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), a member of the Intelligence Committee, said she is open to requesting the documents as part of the panel’s ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n“If it’s necessary to get to the answers then I suspect we would,” Collins told a local radio station on Wednesday.\nTrump’s tax returns would provide a fuller picture of the president’s business empire. Democrats argue the documents must be reviewed to understand whether Trump or his companies have dealings in Russia.\nCollins also said “many” members of the Intelligence Committee will request that Trump’s ex-national security adviser Michael T. Flynn testify as part of their investigation .\nFollow the author @eliseviebeck .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:15:39.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
