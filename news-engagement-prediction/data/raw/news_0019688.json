Like a muscle car, the all-wheel-drive Durango can accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.4 sec. and run the quarter-mile in 12.9 sec.\nWith its widebody style, and a vented hood similar to the one used by the 707 hp Dodge Charger Hellcat, the Durango SRT is so hot that it comes with a voucher for a day at a Bob Bondurant driving school where you can learn to wring the most out of it. But this very sporty SUV still offers plenty of utility with an 8,600-pound tow rating that’s highest among three-row SUVs and well into full-size pickup territory.\nNO FREE RIDES -- DODGE DEMON WILL COME WITH JUST ONE SEAT\nThe Durango SRT also gets a set of high performance Brembo brakes to help keep the speed in check, a stiffer suspension with computer-controlled adaptive dampers to better blend ride comfort and handling, deep bucket seats (even in the back rows) to hold you in place in the turns, and a beefy T-bar shifter for its 8-speed automatic transmission because it just feels right.\nA new digital instrument cluster includes a 180 mph speedometer, although Dodge has not yet confirmed the Durango SRT’s top speed. The price hasn’t been announced, either, but the similarly-powered Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT starts at around $68,000, so figure on the Durango SRT being in that range when it hits showrooms late this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T15:13:47.717+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
