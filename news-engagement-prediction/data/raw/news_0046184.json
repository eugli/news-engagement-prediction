I was 16 and didn't know much about what that meant or the recovery it entailed. In fact, until that diagnosis which was technically Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified —a broad term that, in my case, meant mainly anorexia with occasional bulimic symptoms—I thought my restrictive diet and significant weight loss were healthy. I've learned a lot since. \nI've been mostly symptom-free since age 18, though I still sometimes struggle with disordered eating and always might. But many therapy sessions and two treatment programs have given me tons of tools to cope with poor self-image and destructive urges when they pop up. Here are a few things I've learned about health, body image, and self-acceptance since this journey began. \n1. This is not your fault. When they first learned of my eating disorder, some friends and family members reacted with anger. Why was I causing them so much stress? Couldn't I see that I needed to gain weight, not lose it? These reactions stem from failure to realize that mental illnesses are as real as physical ones. You wouldn't blame someone for having cancer, so you shouldn't blame them for having an eating disorder: the National Eating Disorders Association, nearly 20 million women and 10 million men have suffered from a clinically significant eating disorder at some point in their life. And the last thing survivors need is self-blame. Instead, we deserve compassion. \n2. Basically every woman can relate. During the early stages of my recovery, I thought this issue made me different. But that's just because I didn't talk about it—and because we learn a very narrow version of what an eating disorder looks like. In reality, they take many different forms and affect people of all shapes and sizes. Most women I've opened up to have at some point experienced disordered eating, if not a full-fledged eating disorder. I no longer carry around the embarrassment I used to when I talk about my past. Instead, I open up in order to invite others to discuss their experiences without shame, too. \n3. You can get through the initial discomfort of recovery. I was always cooperative in school, but in eating disorder treatment, I was a rebel. I'd refuse to show up for meals because I so dreaded how anxious I'd feel after eating. But the anxiety passed. And then the anxiety of gaining weight passed. Eating more and weighing more became the new normal. People are extremely adaptable, so the feelings we dread often aren't as bad as we anticipate. \n4. Body image does improve. When I weighed 40 pounds less, I looked larger to myself than I do now. I like photos of myself that I once freaked out about. Your mental health really does shape your perceptions. What others see when they look at you may be different from what you see, and what you see can change over time, so don't lose hope. \n5. It's OK to avoid the mirror. There are a lot of people posting selfies on social media in the name of body positivity , and that's great if it works for them. But when you've got body dysmorphia , seeing your own image can throw you into a tailspin. I used to waste hours staring at my reflection until I \"made peace with\" it. But unsurprisingly, if I don't like my appearance at first glance, staring at it even more doesn't make me feel better. So on bad body image days, I'm better off avoiding mirrors and just not clicking when someone tags a Facebook photo of me. \n6. It's also OK to avoid the scale. My weight has fluctuated a million times throughout the past 10 years, and not always in the ways you'd predict. The last time I weighed myself was about a year ago, and though I've gained a lot of weight (and a little more than I \"should have\" if the BMI chart is your guidance), my health is fine, and I look smaller than I have during times when I've weighed less. In general, weight is not a great measure of health or predictor of appearance. (The site My Body Gallery has helped me see all the different ways the same weight can look.) So, I don't own a scale, and when I get weighed at the doctor's office, I face away from the number. \n7. It's perfectly fine not to \"love your body.\" Another body-positive goal that's awesome if you can make it work—but just not feasible for everyone—is \"loving your body.\" I don't love my body, and I'm still happy with my career, my relationships, and my life. Women get a lot of flack for being insecure, but given the unrealistic expectations imposed on us, you can't blame us. My insecurities only interfere with my daily life if I obsess over them. \n8. You've got to tune people out. A lot of unqualified people have strong opinions about health, and there are tons of conflicting theories about what you should and shouldn't eat. In eating disorder recovery, it's especially important not to listen to people who are on a crusade against gluten or dairy or whatever their enemy of choice is. You've also got to disregard well-intentioned folks who think they know what's best for your recovery. Recovery is an exercise in trusting yourself, because when it comes to your personal health, other people often don't know what they're talking about. \n9. You can't rely on your significant other to improve your body image. People who haven't dealt with this themselves are prone to saying well-meaning but truly triggering stuff. I've had way too many arguments with boyfriends over adjectives they've used to describe my body. So, I've stopped asking what they think. That's not to say I don't feel pretty hot when my (in my humble opinion) pretty hot boyfriend tells me how attractive he finds me. But I already trust that he's attracted to me; the reassurance is just a bonus. When he says something that seems to imply otherwise, I repeat to myself, \"he doesn't mean it like that.\" And when I feel bad about my body, I don't seek recourse in him. I remember what I think of myself on my best days and remind myself that's probably closer to reality. \n10. Your eating disorder is not you. One of the best strategies I learned in recovery was separating myself from my eating disorder. Some even name it Ana (for \"anorexia\"), Mia (for \"bulimia\"), or Ed (for Eating Disorder). Then, when you have a disordered thought, you can ask yourself who's talking. Your eating disorder may think your worth lies in your weight, for example, but you may beg to differ. You existed before your disorder, and you'll stay intact long after.
