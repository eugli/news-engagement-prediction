We have to give passengers a reason other than price to fly with Virgin.\" \nSo Virgin Atlantic set about creating an airline with a vibrancy about it that focused on passenger experience. \nThirty years on, and despite being a minnow, Virgin Atlantic is still flying and it's BA which is struggling. \nBut what, I hear you say, has this got to do with supermarkets? \nA lot actually. \nOverall, airline seats are commodities. Flying from Brisbane to Perth with Qantas is pretty much the same as flying with Virgin. \nWith supermarkets, the food you buy in Coles is pretty much the same as the food you buy in Woolworths. \nSo if your strategy is based on \"down, down, down\" like Coles, or \"cheap, cheap, cheap\" as in Woolies, it becomes a race to the bottom. \nLet's take baked beans. They're the same in both stores so I'll shop at the one which is selling them cheaper. \nPrice will solely dictate customer behaviour. \nWhich is great for customers, but if you're a shareholder of Woolworths or Wesfarmers — which owns Coles — it's not so good. \nMarket share is one thing, but if profit margin is being eroded you're relying on large volumes to maintain or grow earnings. \nAnd again the airline industry is instructive. \nIn 2011, Qantas and Virgin were locked in a battle over market share as upstart Virgin tried to grab as much as it could from the Flying Kangaroo. \nIt prompted Qantas to declare that 65 per cent market share was the \"line in the sand\" over which it would not cross. \nBoth airlines added capacity and discounted fares to ridiculously low levels, flying many routes at a loss. \nNot surprisingly profits were smashed before saner heads prevailed and a truce of sorts was called. Further lowering prices \nBack in supermarkets, where sales growth at the awakening Woolworths has overtaken Coles for the first time in a long time, all the talk coming out of both companies is about further lowering prices. \nFor example, Coles managing director John Durkan said last week, \"we're not changing. Australian consumers have never had it so good\". \nYou expect people to shop at Aldi just because it's cheap, but Woolworths and Coles have a lot more to offer. \nAnd if you're a regular Coles shopper, do you really make comparisons every week with Woolworths prices and vice versa? \nBig shareholders are cheering now as Coles and Woolies \"invest in prices,\" as they euphemistically call price cutting. \nGiven that it's profits that determine dividends though, one wonders how long that will last. \nIn their most recent results Woolworths' pre-tax earnings were down 14 per cent; Coles was off 3 per cent. \nColes and Woolworths still have 70 per cent of Australia's $90 billion supermarket pie, yet their earnings don't reflect that oligopolistic position (unlike the big four banks). \nIf Richard Branson was a shopkeeper he may have been tempted to say, \"whatever I charge at my supermarket I know the other supermarket will match it. We have to give people a reason other than price to shop with us\". \nLike doing something different.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T13:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:22:34.819+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
