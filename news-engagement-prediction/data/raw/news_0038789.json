It is just the natural thing to do to chase after someone runs off after a crash,' Mr Brown said.\nThe driver ran into a building site and tried to climb out of a set of foundations when Mr Brown and another tradie dragged him down and pinned him to the floor\nMr Brown said the man nearly got away from him at first because 'it's been a while since I did a bit of running', but he eventually caught up\n'I went to the job site and caught him trying to climb up a wall, I grabbed his leg, pulled him down and then put him in a restraint. So yeah, it was good fun for a day.'\nSpeaking about the chase, Mr Brown added: 'Mate, I almost fell flat on my face. It's been a while since I've done a bit of running.\n'But you know. Once I got my composure, I was straight on him again.'\nPolice have arrested a 21-year-old man who has been charged with a string of motoring offences and burglary as officers allege the vehicle was stolen\nPolice have since arrested a 21-year-old man who is now charged with various motoring offences, burglary and fraud.\nOfficers say the vehicle was one of two stolen from New Farm on Monday.\nThey were alerted to the dangerous driving after the vehicle's owner used an iPad tracking app to trace the electronic device which had been left inside the vehicle.", "external_links": ["https://www.9now.com.au/today", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-16T01:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T06:56:04.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
