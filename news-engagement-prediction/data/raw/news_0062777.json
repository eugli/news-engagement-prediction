Authorities estimate the damage to reach P1.5 million. ADVERTISEMENT \nNo one was seriously injured. \nThe four affected sitios in Barangay Tisa were Lutaw-lutaw, Tacao, Luhai, and Kauswagan. \nCity Hall’s Department of Social Welfare and Services (DSWS) immediately provided food to the affected residents, many of whom occupied the gymnasiums in the two affected barangays. \nEach affected family is getting P20,000 from the Cebu City government. \nBarangay Tisa Captain Philip Zafra said they received reports that a couple had a confrontation, prompting the husband to throw a lighted lamp at his wife inside their residence. \nInvestigators have sought out the man and his wife to give them a chance to air their side on reports that their fight triggered the destructive fire. \nAnother information they received was that their child was left alone in the house lighted by a lamp that accidentally fell past midnight on Monday. \nZafra has immediately called on the couple to appear at his office and explain. \nCebu City Fire Marshal Rogelio Bongabong said they received the fire alarm at 12:28 a.m. \nAfter about an hour, he declared a Task Force Alpha, calling fire trucks from other cities to help Cebu City firefighters put out the blaze. \nBongabong said the fire was placed under control at 2:33 a.m. but was put out at 6:58 a.m. \nAs the Fire Prevention Month approaches, Bongabong is urging people to be fire-safety conscious at all times. \nMonday’s fire was the biggest in Cebu City since January 2017. \nMajority of the fires in Cebu City were caused by faulty electrical wiring and unattended open flame like lighted candles, the BFP-Cebu City record showed. \nBongabong encouraged the public to be extra-careful and to invest in early warning devices like smoke detectors and heat sensors. \nHe said each house should have fire extinguishers and alternative exit doors. \nZafra appealed to people to assist those affected by the fire. \n“What they need now are toiletries, blanket, mats, pillows, water, and used clothing,” he said. \nEleuterio Duazo, 58, said he was sound asleep inside his room when he heard a commotion from outside. \nHe said he quickly got up and saw the huge blaze near their house. Duazo immediately ran for safety. \n“I am happy that nothing bad happened to me,” said Duazo whose wife went home to Tuburan town when the fire broke out. \nHe appealed to authorities to conduct a thorough investigation and, if validated, to file charges against the couple who reportedly caused the fire. \n“I want them to answer for what they did),” Duazo said.
