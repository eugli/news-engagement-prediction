I am proud to lead this party,\" he told reporters. \n\"We will continue our campaigning work on the NHS, on social care, on housing.\" \nOne leading trade union figure warned Mr Corbyn he had to \"turn things around\" and show he could deliver a Labour government, while another said he needs to take responsibility for improving the party's fortunes \"sooner rather than later\". \nFollowing a tumultuous election night on Thursday, a jubilant Theresa May travelled north to Copeland to hail an \"astounding\" victory for Tory candidate Trudy Harrison. \nHer triumph was the first gain for a governing party in a parliamentary by-election since 1982. \nLater, Mrs May told the Conservative Councillors' Association conference in Lincolnshire Labour's \"devastating\" defeat showed it is \"out of touch with the concerns of ordinary working people\" and that only the Tories \"can truly call itself the party of working people\". Jeremy Corbyn pictured on Friday Credit: PA \nThere was some consolation for Labour in Stoke-on-Trent Central, where it saw off a concerted challenge from Ukip leader Paul Nuttall , albeit with a reduced majority. \nBut there was despair among MPs at the defeat in Copeland, with John Woodcock, MP for neighbouring Barrow-in-Furness, warning the party was heading for a \"historic and catastrophic defeat\" at the general election. \nSenior Labour backbencher David Winnick said Mr Corbyn was an \"obstacle\" to victory and should consider his position as he is \"simply not acceptable\" to traditional Labour voters. \nLabour's shadow leader of the Lords, Baroness Smith, described the Copeland defeat as \"devastating\" and said Mr Corbyn should \"think long and hard\" about his response.
