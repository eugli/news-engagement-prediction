(Goran Kosanovic/For The Washington Post) This dish of warm, cinnamon-scented pears with a nutty crumble topping makes you feel good before you even take a bite. Its homey aroma fills your kitchen as it bakes so you can’t help but smile with anticipation.\nThe dessert delivers completely when you dig in, too, not only because it hits the spot as a comfort-food classic but also because it achieves that goal in a healthier way. Rather than being loaded with added sugar, the natural sweetness and subtle flavor of ripe pears shines through, enhanced with a little maple syrup and gently spiced with ground cinnamon and ginger.\nAnd instead of leaning on butter, white flour and sugar for the crumble topping, this one is centered on the nutty crunch of ground almonds (or almond meal) with healthy oil and two kinds of whole grains: oats and whole-wheat flour. The recipe has just the right level of sweetness to satisfy as a dessert, especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt on top, but not so much that it would be out of place for breakfast. I can tell you firsthand that, with a dollop of yogurt, it is a lovely way to start the day.\nfood@washpost.com\nScale, print and rate the recipe in our Recipe Finder :\nPear Crumble\n8 to 9 servings\nYou’ll need an 8-by-8-inch baking dish.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the topping 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon slivered almonds (may substitute 1/2 cup almond meal) 1/2 cup old-fashioned rolled oats (do not use quick-cooking or instant) 1/4 cup whole-wheat pastry flour (may substitute regular whole-wheat flour) 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup canola oil, or other neutral-tasting oil, plus more for the baking dish For the filling 3 pounds ripe but firm pears, peeled, cored and sliced into 1/4- inch slices 1/4 cup pure maple syrup 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon cornstarch 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger\nSTEPS\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees.
