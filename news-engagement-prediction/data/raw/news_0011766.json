Robart, appointed by former President George .W. Bush, when he granted an injunction by blocking enforcement of Trump's executive order instituting the travel ban, acting at the request of Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, whose office said that the temporary restraining order applies nationwide. \n\nTrump's policy banned travel to the US from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days, suspended all refugee entry to the US for 120 days and indefinitely suspended entry for Syrian refugees. \n\nIf the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rules against the Trump government, the case could go to the Supreme Court, something many experts consider likely. \n\nAsked at a gala in Florida about whether he was confident his administration would prevail in the appeal, Trump replied, \"We'll win. For the safety of our country, we'll win\", CNN reported. \n\nThe three judges who will likely hear the appeal are: Judge William Canby, who was appointed by President Jimmy Carter; Richard Clifton, who was appointed by Bush; and Michelle Friedland, a President Barack Obama appointee. \n\nAlthough it is unclear what form of relief the Justice Department will seek, the White House said on Friday that it wants an \"emergency stay\" of Robart's order. \n\nAlso on Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security announced it had suspended all actions to implement the immigration order and would resume standard inspections of travellers as it did prior to the signing of the travel ban.
