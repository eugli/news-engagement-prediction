Magazine Megyn Kelly, Matt Lauer, and the Battle for the Future of NBC In his high-profile, high-priced hire of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, NBC News chief Andy Lack placed a major bet on star power. But Lack’s biggest, priciest talent, Today ’s Matt Lauer, provides something of a cautionary tale. With morning news being one of the last mass television markets, its personalities can draw fire as well as ratings. by Twitter TOPS OF THE MORNING Today anchors Savannah Guthrie and Matt Lauer; NBC News chairman Andy Lack; NBC’s newest recruit, Megyn Kelly; and departing Today’s Take co-host Tamron Hall. Photo Illustration by Matt Chase; Photographs from left, by John Lamparski/WireImage, Dan Jackman/Wenn/Newscom, Brad Barket/Wireimage, Kevin Winter/Getty Images, Stephen Smith/Sipa USA/Newscom, Anthony Quintano (Background). The Survivor Andy Lack, the chairman of NBC News, is seen by many of his peers as an old-school newsman in the mold of the late Roone Arledge, the famed ABC News president. Arledge played a major role in establishing ABC News as one of the leading evening newscasts in the 1980s and 90s. He did so in part by hiring big names and high-profile talent—for instance, wooing Diane Sawyer away from CBS News, even though ABC already employed the very visible Barbara Walters. Lack is currently on his second tour at NBC. He joined NBC News in 1993, rose to the top of the news division, then left in 2003 to head up Sony Music. He returned in 2015 in the wake of the scandal involving news anchor Brian Williams, who was revealed to have embellished, among other stories, his experience during an incident in Iraq in 2003. Recently, Lack pulled an Arledge: wooing away Megyn Kelly from Fox News . The move generated a flurry of headlines not only for its audacity but also because it was initially unclear just what Kelly would be doing at NBC. More than anything, the idea seemed to represent an act of faith in what high-profile talent, rather than mission or content, can accomplish: star power as business model. Until her hiring by NBC, Kelly was the wildly successful host of Fox News’s The Kelly File , a political and current-events show on weeknights that was one of the highest-rated cable-news programs in the country. NBC is paying Kelly more than $15 million, far less than the $25 million a year she was offered to stay at Fox. NBC went to her with a blank slate, according to a person close to Kelly. “Everyone else came to her with an idea of what they wanted.” VIDEO: Megyn Kelly Asks 12 of Her Toughest Questions Now she is in place. But she is not there all by herself: another pricey star has been at NBC for a very long time. Matt Lauer is one of the highest-paid men in television news—he reportedly will receive up to $25 million a year through at least 2018 under the terms of his latest contract. Many rivals, superiors, counterparts, and colleagues have fallen by the wayside during his 20 years atop Today , which attracts just over 4 million viewers every morning (down from 5.5 million in 2008). He has survived many storms at NBC News, always emerging more powerful from each wave of turmoil. Lauer is very good at what he does as a morning-show host, and he has become a big figure in the television-news landscape—even as the landscape itself has contracted. The future is against morning television. The audience has been in decline for 30 years, and there’s no reason to think that slide is going to stop. This fact simply makes protecting the profits of morning television all the more important. The three network morning shows together represent about a billion dollars in revenue for their corporate parents. Today alone accounts for about half of that. For the broadcast-news divisions, the morning shows can make the difference between profit and loss. If it weren’t for their morning shows, CBS News and ABC News would lose money. NBC News would still be profitable, but only because of its cable arm, MSNBC. Lauer’s knack for survival gets to the heart of something fundamental about traditional TV news outlets—and morning television in particular. NBC News has had to deliver four multi-million-dollar settlements to employees who have been separated from the Today show for one reason or another. Each move caused high anxiety inside the news division—and, internally, an elevated sense of Lauer’s importance to the bottom line. There’s an investment concept known as the “melting ice cube” syndrome—it describes assets that are likely to decline in value over the long term. If NBC News is the ice cube, then Lauer is the element that keeps it from melting away. In the process, the one thing perpetually preserved is Lauer himself. To understand Lauer’s role at NBC News, I spoke with NBC executives as well as current and former colleagues and rivals. (Lauer and Megyn Kelly declined to be interviewed, as did Andy Lack. Lack’s wife, Betsy, was a contributing editor of Vanity Fair but left the company in January 2016. She did not participate in this story.) The competition among morning shows (and within morning shows), once good-natured, is now a battle for survival. Lauer may be the most successful personality within this eroding eco-sphere, but his missteps and his baggage can be costly. In 2012, amid declining ratings—the show had slipped behind Good Morning America—Today ousted Lauer’s co-anchor at the time, Ann Curry, a move that Lauer at the very least condoned and, by some accounts, helped orchestrate. His reputation was further damaged by much-criticized back-to-back interviews with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton last September—a moment that epitomized the failures of TV journalism more broadly. Now NBC News has brought Megyn Kelly aboard. In February it was revealed that she would host a weekday-morning show—probably starting in the fall—a move that pushed aside Tamron Hall , who subsequently left the company. Kelly herself is not someone who can be easily let go, shunted off to the hinterland. \nLauer interviews Hillary Clinton last September. By Doug Mills/The New York Times/Redux. An Open Playing Field Matt Lauer became a major media presence with a single interview, one that would be remembered for a phrase not even uttered by him. On January 27, 1998, just a year into his new job as a co-anchor on Today , Lauer faced a moment that was as much his own public trial as it was one for the First Lady he was about to question. He wasn’t even supposed to be in the chair. Weeks before, the producers at Today had arranged for anchor Katie Couric to interview Hillary Clinton about a child-care plan Clinton was advocating. Ten days before the interview date, the Drudge Report broke a story about Hillary Clinton’s husband, President Bill Clinton, and his alleged affair with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. A week after the story hit, Couric’s husband died of colon cancer. Obviously, Couric would not be conducting the interview. Her much less famous co-anchor would have to fill in. Undeterred by the switch and with a message to deliver, Hillary Clinton kept her appointment. The Today producers spent three days straight prepping Lauer. Before he joined the show, Lauer had been a journeyman lifestyle reporter and local anchorman. He had never been seen as that guy , meaning the guy who could handle a big interview. And now there he was. With a dutiful smile and a deferential air, Lauer began to ask Mrs. Clinton about whether she had known the nature of her husband’s relationship with Monica Lewinsky; whether he had ever described the relationship to her; and whether, hypothetically, she believed that a president who lied to cover up an extramarital affair should resign. Finally, perhaps feeling cornered by this line of questioning, Clinton attempted to deflect the inquiries, blaming the Lewinsky story not on her husband’s behavior but on a “vast right-wing conspiracy” that had been working to thwart Bill Clinton ever since he started running for president. The phrase ricocheted around the media-sphere, earning Clinton considerable criticism for a paranoia that now looks like prescience. For people at NBC News, the moment answered a key question about Lauer. “Everybody said, ‘Holy cow, he’s amazing!’” one NBC staffer at the time recalled. “We’re going to be just fine.” For a while, the Today show was just fine, and it was partly thanks to Lauer. He was a good beta figure to Katie Couric’s bright on-screen alpha wattage. The pair spent the next dec­ade and a half dominating the morning shows. Opening with half an hour of news programming, Today helped set the agenda for everyone else. By contemporary standards, it was an open playing field. CNN was a relative newcomer, Fox News had barely launched, and MSNBC was still in its infancy. There was no Twitter, no smartphone. “In the 90s, we prided ourselves that, if you only had 30 minutes to watch the news, you should watch the Today show,” the former NBC staffer told me. But as more outlets competed for viewers’ attention, Today started to soften its news content, opting for human-interest stories and cooking how-tos. Lauer, who traveled the planet as part of the popular “Where in the World Is Matt Lauer?” feature, became the poster child of this transformation. The morning news shows were always seen as an entertainment-and-news hybrid, unlike their more buttoned-down nightly counterparts. And they raked in the advertising dollars. Even now, Today is one of the highest-grossing shows on television. But that half-hour of news has changed. Today has eliminated the position of “newsreader.” The two-hour Today time slot has been lengthened to three hours and then to four, to accommodate a 10 A.M. hour of wine-sipping hosts who make Lauer look as sober as Walter Cronkite. \nLeft, Lauer with Couric during her last appearance on the Today show, 2006; right, Lauer with co-host Meredith Vieira, 2006.

Rise and Shine The first morning television show in the country, 3 to Get Ready , aired on WPTZ, NBC’s Philadelphia affiliate, in 1950. The show featured the comedian Ernie Kovacs, who entertained his viewers with comic characters such as Percy Dovetonsils, a lisping and effeminate “poet laureate” in a leopard smoking jacket. 3 to Get Ready ran from 7 to 9 A.M. and broke three times—at 7:30, 8, and 8:30—for five minutes of news. Inspired by the success of the program, NBC executive Pat Weaver—the father of Sigourney—adopt­ed the format for national consumption (the pre-production name for the show was The Rise and Shine Revue ) and installed a bespectacled Dave Garroway as host. His official title on Today was “communicator.” He had worked as a lab assistant at Harvard before becoming a page at NBC, where he enrolled in the network’s announcer training school. He was a disc jockey for a Chicago radio station and later hosted a variety show, Garroway at Large . Weaver recruited him from there. On January 14, 1952, Garroway promised viewers of what was now called The Today Show that he would “put you in touch with the world we live in” and report on current trends in arts, sports, music, and “all forms of human endeavor.” Viewers rejected his invitation, and the show suffered poor ratings until Garroway gained a co-host, J. Fred Muggs, who was a chimpanzee. (The show’s original newscaster quit when producers brought Muggs on board.) In 1960, New York Times writer Richard F. Shepard wrote of Garroway that “he does not crash into the home with the false jollity and thunderous witticisms of a backslapper. He is pleasant, serious, scholarly looking and not obtrusively convivial.” \nLAUER HAS SURVIVED MANY STORMS, EMERGING MORE POWERFUL FROM EACH WAVE OF TURMOIL. Twitter Matt Lauer was barely three years old when those words were written. He was born in New York City and grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut. During his senior year at Ohio University, where he studied telecommunications, Lauer interned at a local CBS affiliate in West Virginia, and when the station offered him a spot producing its midday news show, he took the job and dropped out of college. In subsequent years, Lauer moved from place to place—Huntington, West Virginia; Richmond, Virginia; Providence, Rhode Island; and eventually Boston and New York. The experience gave Lauer what his later bosses perceived as a sense of insecurity that fueled his work ethic and preparedness. In 1991, after refusing to read commercial messages live on the air for an independent New York morning program called 9 Broadcast Plaza , Lauer was fired. He moved out of Manhattan and spent the next period adrift. He likes to tell the story of how, one day, he called a tree-trimming company about a job it was advertising. He was waiting for the return call when his phone rang. It was Bill Bolster, the general manager at WNBC, the local New York NBC affiliate. Bolster wanted Lauer to anchor the six A.M. local show that preceded Today . Lauer started the job in 1992 and was in it for a year when NBC started looking for a new anchor to eventually replace Bryant Gumbel. Lauer had by then attracted the attention of Jeff Zucker , who had taken over as executive producer of Today . Zucker was impressed by Lauer’s easy manner with Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel as he handed off to them. Lauer took over Gumbel’s seat in 1997. While Gumbel had opened the show every day, now Couric and Lauer split the week, though she was clearly the senior anchor. Then, in 2006, Couric left. According to Nielsen ratings, about 13 million people on average watch one of the three network morning shows. That’s 10 million fewer viewers than tune in to the evening news on those three networks. From 2008 to the pres­ent, Today has lost 17 percent of its viewers. As you would expect, the viewers who have disappeared are the younger and more affluent ones, the very people most valuable to the advertising community. ( Today still has a younger and more affluent audience than its primary rival, Good Morning America .) The most surprising thing may be that the decline isn’t greater, given the proliferation of other news and entertainment sources. For a significant portion of the audience, Today is as much a habit as it is a news source. But, for all the slippage, the morning-show format remains the last gasp of daily mass appeal. There’s real­ly nothing else like it in the culture. \nLauer at Skibo Castle, in Dornoch, Scotland, 2002. From NBC NewsWire/Getty Images. Mean Streak? And because it remains a mass phenomenon, what happens on these shows—and inside them—is highly visible. As a household name, Lauer is more recognizable than any other active TV news personality. Like most news organizations, NBC News recoils when it is actually the subject of news reports. But in recent years the news division of NBC has generated headlines for all the wrong reasons. There was the animosity between Lauer and Ann Curry; the fabulism on the part of former NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams; and, most recently, the greatest October surprise in recent memory, inadvertently courtesy of a short-lived and now departed Today co-host, Billy Bush. Throughout, Lauer has emerged unscathed. One former NBC executive explained that the reason Lauer is both untouched and always rewarded—too big to fail—is that he pretty much has to be: “If Matt Lauer dropped dead tomorrow, there is no heir apparent, and that is why Matt can drive the price of what they pay him.” Potential threats always seem to get moved out of the way. “The most dangerous seat in television news,” one industry insider told me, “seems to be next to Matt Lauer.” For NBC, the Ann Curry ouster was terrifying—not because it resulted in Ann Curry leaving Today but because it surfaced an apparent mean streak in Lauer that viewers had never known about. And once they saw it, it was hard to get them to unsee it. The episode was outlined in Brian Stelter’s definitive 2013 book, Top of the Morning . Before becoming Today ’s co-anchor, in 2011, Curry had served for years as the program’s newsreader. She was curious about international news and came across as both serious and empathetic. After Katie Couric stepped down, NBC News put Meredith Vieira, not Curry, in Couric’s old chair. Curry was wounded, but she was promised the job when Vieira left. Vieira, a former host of ABC’s The View , could chat easily with Lauer on-air—and held the job at Today for five years. Curry never established the same sort of connection. Ratings declined, and Lauer’s irritation with Curry was evident, both inside the company and to viewers. After Curry’s departure, Lauer, his new co-host, Savannah Guthrie, and Al Roker were interviewing the women’s Olympic rowing team about a famous rowing tradition, which involves tossing a teammate in the water immediately after a race. “The tradition here in New York is, you throw her in the Hudson River,” Lauer said, to laughter from the crowd assembled outside Rockefeller Center. Roker chimed in, “Which is different than our tradition, which is to throw one of us under the bus.” \nLauer with Ann Curry, 2012. By Peter Kramer/NBC Newswire/Getty Images. The Curry story was just one unhappy episode out of many. A more recent controversy intersected with national politics in a way no one could ignore—threatening to derail Donald Trump’s presidential campaign while at the same time generating blowback that NBC had to confront. The stage was set last year when Today ’s Natalie Morales moved to Los Angeles to anchor the NBC program Access Hollywood . That shift in the lineup created a morning-show vacancy that was filled by former Access Hollywood co-anchor Billy Bush, a first cousin of George W. Bush and Jeb Bush. Headlines surrounding his arrival at Today last August, in the Post and elsewhere, hinted that Bush was being shunned by his new colleagues because he was seen as a “frat guy” and not worthy of the Today -show pedigree. One reason he may have been greeted with hostility is that he epitomized the idea of Today as primarily an entertainment vehicle—a notion that may be largely true but that is also psychologically resisted. “The problem is that these news divisions are really tricky places and have strong cultures,” a former NBC executive told me. “Anyone who comes in who doesn’t have the news chops gets hammered.” Billy Bush became infamous last October when tape and audio surfaced of Bush and Donald Trump, back in 2005, talking in vulgar terms about women. The story behind the tape revealed rivalries and enmity between (and inside) NBC News and its entertainment cousin, Access Hollywood . In the tape, Trump can be heard playfully describing to Bush how he had sexually harassed or assaulted various women. At one point Trump described how he had tried to “move” on a certain married woman, who had then rebuffed him. Bush could be heard laughing and goading him on. The woman was Billy Bush’s Access Hollywood co-anchor, Nancy O’Dell. “People who remembered that tape here remembered it not as a Trump tape but as a Nancy O’Dell tape,” an NBC staffer told me. “And you could see that Billy was not defending Nancy at all.” NBC’s initial reaction when the video surfaced was to suspend Bush. Bush issued a statement saying that he was “embarrassed and ashamed.” Noah Oppenheim, then the executive in charge of Today (in February he was named president of NBC News), surveyed his staff by phone and e-mail. The feeling was universal: Bush was widely unloved. Two days after Bush’s apology, the New York Post reported that NBC was “negotiating his exit.” A week later, he resigned. More recently, the NBC staff has been shaken by the departure of Tamron Hall. Hall was the first black female co-host of Today . She joined MSNBC in 2007 and later took on several roles at NBC. In 2014, she became the co-host of Today’s Take , the show’s third hour. Hall found out about Megyn Kelly’s arrival only when it was publicly announced, according to a person close to her. Even after the announcement, as rumors surfaced that Kelly would likely take over part of NBC’s morning lineup, “no one said anything to her” about plans for Hall’s own future. An NBC source denies this account and says, “The right people were talking to Tamron all along.” The announcement of Kelly’s arrival happened to coincide with the timing of Hall’s contract renewal at NBC. She was invited to stay on as a national anchor for Today , but decided that the future did not look promising. “It’s like Game of Thrones over there—you just don’t see anything coming until your head is chopped off,” said a person close to Hall. \nLauer with, from left, Al Roker, Katie Couric, Bryant Gumbel, and Willard Scott, 1997. From NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images. Doubling Down Ever since Ann Curry’s departure, Today has been engaged in a re-evaluation of its reason for being. “We all needed to figure out who we are,” one NBC insider told me. At the behest of Deborah Turness, then the president of NBC News, Today went through an exhaustive exercise analyzing its own DNA. What producers and executives determined was that, unlike what they see as its more tawdry true-crime-and-celebrity rival, Good Morning America , “the whole essence of what the Today show is is news,” the insider said. Today certainly maintains a cooler veneer than its rival. Whereas the hosts on G.M.A. chat casually with their crew live on-air and reveal intimate details about their personal lives, the Today anchors remain friendly but distant. With its new co-host, Savannah Guthrie, Today is doing better among the coveted 25- to 54-year-olds than other morning shows, and in terms of overall audience ratings it’s back on G.M.A. ’s heels. Today is relentlessly soft and conventional, but its self-identification as a “news” show is a key to understanding how the man at the top of the show views himself. No matter how many cooking demonstrations or boy-band interviews he conducts, Matt Lauer sees himself as a newsman. But as a newsman he has limitations. Last September, nearly 20 years after that initial interview with Clinton, Lauer found himself interviewing her again. Clinton was now the Democratic nominee for president, and she was participating in a “commander-in-chief forum” hosted by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America along with NBC News. Lauer interviewed Clinton in a studio constructed aboard the decommissioned aircraft carrier Intrepid ; separately, he interviewed Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, on the same set. Each candidate was allotted 30 minutes with Lauer, back-to-back. Other NBC personalities had vied for the job, including MSNBC host Rachel Maddow and Meet the Press host Chuck Todd. Andy Lack selected Lauer and the Today staff prepped him and drafted questions. Inside NBC News, and even in some quarters beyond it, Lauer is known as the best interviewer in the business. His talents were on display in a recent exchange with White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. Some of his skill comes from experience, and some of it comes from Lauer’s natural curiosity and ability to make conversation with just about anyone. Lack once noted that Lauer could interview a fire hydrant and be interested in it. What he faced aboard the Intrepid was something far more complicated, and he came up short. The day after the forum, The New York Times devoted three articles, including an editorial, to how disastrous Lauer’s performance had been. Among other things, he failed to challenge Trump on an easily checked assertion about Trump’s support of the war in Iraq. (Trump said he was against the war from the start, which was untrue.) He also spent 10 minutes asking Clinton about her e-mails and then rushed her answer—“as briefly as you can,” he demanded—when she tried to offer a response on how she would handle the threat of ISIS. Lauer’s selection as the interviewer at the forum showed how internal NBC politics could end up distorting perceptions of major news events for the rest of us. In the eyes of Today -show insiders, the Intrepid affair felt like an unfortunate bookend to that long-ago interview with Hillary Clinton. But what Lauer did in that commander-in-chief forum was essentially repeated time and again by every other broadcast network news program, not to mention cable news and some newspapers and magazines. His performance was indicative of something larger: the general inability among the media to make a distinction between Clinton’s e-mail use and Trump’s deliberate falsehoods and his dangerous foreign-policy instincts. If you watched only Matt Lauer, you’d think that Clinton’s use of a private e-mail server was as serious as, if not more serious than, Trump’s praise of Vladimir Putin, his disappointment that the U.S. didn’t steal Iraq’s oil, and his bad-mouthing of NATO. The official response from NBC to the criticism—in essence, that Lauer did better than anyone else could have done under the circumstances—reveals how much the media had given away in terms of credibility and rigor even before “fake news” came along. An NBC source noted that Clinton’s initial responses had been un­nec­essarily long-winded, and that Lauer’s decision not to challenge Trump on his support for the Iraq war was born not out of ill-preparedness, but was designed to leave enough time to question him on other foreign-policy matters important to the military veterans in attendance. Lauer seems to have regained his popularity among Today viewers, who have been described (in NBC-commissioned research) as having “forgiven” him for the Ann Curry episode. Andy Lack, long close to Lauer, has been building up the bench at NBC News, most notably by hiring Megyn Kelly. Rupert Murdoch and his sons were eager to keep Kelly at Fox News and offered her $100 million over four years to stay. Many people in the television world expected that she would. That didn’t deter Lack, who approached Kelly with a “figure it out later” strategy that (we now know) in some fashion will include a Sunday-night “magazine” show and political reporting of major events in addition to her role hosting the weekday-morning show. Kelly is untested in the softer environs of morning television. Aside from the executives at NBC and NBC News, according to two people familiar with the discussions, there was only one on-air personality who knew about Kelly’s wooing well in advance: Matt Lauer. (NBC denies this.) Coming from rightward-leaning Fox, Kelly might be seen as an effort by NBC to come to terms with life in a Donald Trump era. She is not overtly or inevitably a challenge to Lauer—perhaps she will prove a complement. More to the point, though, Kelly represents a literal doubling down on the proposition that, when it comes to a successful news operation, personality is what counts, and everything else must accommodate itself to that reality. How that will translate into what we see on TV remains to be seen, but one fact can’t be argued with: there used to be only one person at NBC News who was too big to fail. Now there are two.
