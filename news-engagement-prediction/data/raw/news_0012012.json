Humble Coffee co-owner Mark Baker is developing a mixed-used project at the former Sears… more Courtesy Matt Oberer In addition, Baker's firm, Baker Architecture + Design, will have space at 505 Center. Coming soon will be a co-working space. UNM CityLab Studio already has an existing lease there. In a release, Baker said two restaurant spaces are available. The apartments, designed by Baker A+D, will range from 384 square feet to 876 square feet. All will include stainless steel appliances and a washer and dryer. The apartments will also come with surface parking. A fitness room and community room are also planned, along with interior bicycle parking. Architects designed a new portal along Central Avenue, which will be used for outdoor dining. The 58,000-square-foot 505 Center is set to open in July. Baker did not disclose the cost of redeveloping the building. Insight Construction will be the contractor. Washington Federal is the lender and 3 Advertising will handle the branding and marketing. Michael Butler of Lockehouse Retail Group is the leasing agent. \"We're excited to bring this beautiful building back to life and to contribute to the momentum that already exists in the revitalization of Downtown,\" Baker said in a statement. \"The city's commitment to rapid transit was definitely a contributing factor in our decision to execute this project.\" The building was originally built in 1937 for Lovelace and purchased by Sears in the 1940s, according to Baker. Baker bought the building for an undisclosed sum last year. In 2012, Business First reported the building was up for sale for $3.8 million . Last month, Business First reported that Baker is working on opening a brewery in the Highland neighborhood near Nob Hill. 505.348.8323 | cortiz@bizjournals.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:13:09.546+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
