Senator Andy Uba \nReacting to the announcement, Senate Minority Leader, Senator Godswill Akpabio, who rose under Order 43, said his seat must be declared vacant and made to surrender his mandate. \nAkpabio, who explained that the mandate belonged to the PDP, said if he failed, they would go to court. \nHe said: “Mr. President, distinguished colleagues, the mandate belongs to PDP, and by virtue of what has happened, he has to surrender his seat, else we will go to court to contend for it.” \nThe Minority Leader, however, advised the Senate President to remove him as Chairman of Public Accounts Committee to save the Senate of any confusion. \nUba currently chairs the Committee on Public Accounts, a seat that is traditionally reserved for the opposition party. \nIt would be recalled that Public Accounts Committee is the only committee in the Senate and House of Representatives that reflects in the constitution and is always headed by the opposition. \nSenator Uba’s defection came barely a month and two days after Senator Nelson Asuquo Effiong, Akwa Ibom South, dumped the PDP for the APC. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:01:12.429+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
