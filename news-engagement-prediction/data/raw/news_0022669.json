The estimated retail value of this is a staggering £7.5bn, and the government’s waste advisory body, Wrap, calculates that a typical family wastes £700 of food a year.\nA national supermarket study of the food waste patterns of 5,050 UK consumers, published on Friday, reveals nearly two-fifths of those aged over 65 say they never waste food, compared with just 17% of those under 35.\nThe research by Sainsbury’s found more than half (55%) of 18- to 34-year-olds had a “live to eat” attitude to food – more about pleasure than necessity but with higher shopping bills and more waste. Older generations were more likely to “eat to live” with lower grocery bills and reduced waste.\nMillennials – those born in or after the mid-1980s – were also the most likely to try unusual recipes to create Instagram -friendly dishes, involving exotic ingredients that are harder to reuse. \n“A post-war increase in household food waste is due to changes in how we value choice, time and money in relation to food,” said food historian and broadcaster Dr Polly Russell . “Gone are the days of eating the same food, on the same days of the week, week in, week out. Most people today, particularly younger generations, demand variety. However, with a menu which changes often, it is more challenging to control waste and plan ahead.”\nThe over-55s are the most comfortable in the kitchen, the survey found, with just 18% wishing they knew more about managing and cooking food. In contrast, more than half of those aged 18 to 34 admit a lack of culinary know-how. When it comes to throwing away leftovers, 18- to 34-year-olds are the most likely culprits, with 17% of them leaving leftovers three or more times a week. \n\nYounger consumers also fail to plan ahead. Some 20% of those under 35 admit to wasting the most food after a big shopping trip, compared with 8% of 55- to 64-year-olds and just 7% of the 65-plus age group.\nThe findings are part of Sainsbury’s £10m “waste less, save more” scheme to help households save money by cutting food waste. It is awaiting the results of a year-long trial in the Derbyshire market town of Swadlincote, which was chosen as a testbed for reducing household food waste.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:19:40.768+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
