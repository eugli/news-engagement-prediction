Grant (@viralpoet) February 13, 2017 \nThe blaze, which started as two separate fires on Monday, and which sparked a local civil defence state of emergency, was fanned by a wind change and merged into one blaze which covered more than 1850 hectares (4,570 acres) by Wednesday night, authorities said. \nIt has already claimed the life of helicopter pilot Steve Askin, who crashed while fighting the fire on Tuesday. Sixteen firefighting helicopters took to the air at first light on Thursday but rain isn’t expected until Friday afternoon. \n“It’s not a really good forecast for firefighting ... we are expecting winds to develop this afternoon,” civil defence controller Dave Adamson told Radio New Zealand . \nOn Thursday morning, Christchurch civil defence said a temperature drop and rise in humidity had improved conditions. An easterly wind was expected to turn into a northerly during the morning, with wind speeds picking up to 30km/h in the afternoon. Chris van der Leer (@cvanderleer) February 15, 2017 \n“At this point in time the fire’s not threatening any other properties ... but we’ll just have to see how the day and the fire develops,” Adamson said. \nAround 120 firefighters and support crew have been involved in ground operations since the fire broke out on Monday night. About 85 New Zealand defence force personnel are also helping with efforts to fight the blaze.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:23:59.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
