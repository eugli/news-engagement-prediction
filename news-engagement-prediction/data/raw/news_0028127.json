BIG MATCHES \nThe expectation is that he’ll dethrone Owens, before dropping the red strap to The Beast Incarnate in Orlando on April 2, but WWE could be planning on more entertaining segments – if things go their way.

Article continues below Watch: Eric Bailly's individual highlights vs Watford show he bossed the game \nThey went all-out to mock Goldberg, they had pre-recorded Gillberg chants, he had a dotted line on his arm to mimic Goldberg’s tribal tattoo and even his catchphrases were similar. \nWhile Goldberg asked ‘who’s next’, Gillberg asked ‘who’s first’, as he simply couldn’t pick up a win. WHO'S FIRST? \nWhile they didn’t copy the same booking by having him being dominant, he and his goofy ways managed to become the longest reigning WWF Light Heavyweight Champion in history, holding it for 15 months. \nIf they’re able to bring him back for some appearances, it’ll be interesting to see how they use him. \nThey could have Kevin Owens and Chris Jericho involved to mock Goldberg ahead of Fastlane, and considering they are a good comedy act, it perhaps makes the most sense. \nOr, Paul Heyman could bring him out and feed him to his beast, in the build-up to the WrestleMania 33 clash. \nEither way, it could be hilarious to see Goldberg and Gillberg come face to face on WWE television once again. \nHow should WWE use Gillberg if he returns?
