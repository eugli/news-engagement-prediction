(Evan Vucci/AP) \nDr. Harold N. Bornstein, President Donald Trump 's doctor, told The New York Times in several interviews that the president is taking medication to treat three conditions, including one designed to promote hair growth. \nThe medications include finasteride, a prostate-treatment drug that's also marketed to individuals for male-pattern baldness , a drug to treat rosacea (\"common antibiotic\" tetracycline) and a statin to control high blood cholesterol and lipids (blood fats). The finasteride seemingly explains Trump's low levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), a prostate cancer marker, since the drug lowers such antigens. Trump has often taken good-natured ribbing about his hair, perhaps most memorably on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" back in September when Trump let Fallon mess up his full head of hair to laughs and applause from the audience. Trump also takes a baby aspirin every day to lower his heart attack risk, according to Bornstein. \nThese interviews come after Bornstein released two letters about Trump's health, one in December 2015 and another in September 2016. \nIn the first, he wrote, \"If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\" \nWhite House officials did not respond to The New York Times regarding Bornstein's latest claims nor whether he is currently Trump's doctor. U.S. News reached out to the White House to independently verify the report, but did not hear back before this was published. \nBornstein, who the Times says was \"moody\" during parts of the interviews, says he and the president haven't had contact since he assumed the role nor has the White House asked for Trump's medical records. He did add that if he were Trump's White House doctor, \"he doubted that he would include in Mr. Trump's annual checkup any psychometric tests as a base line for potential dementia,\" The New York Times reports. This is despite Trump's father having Alzheimer's in addition to experts suggesting political leaders have tests like this done. Slideshow Navigating the germ jungle (iStockphoto) \nAs cold and flu season takes co-workers hostage and sends roommates into hibernation, don’t blame the chilly weather. The germs festering in the nooks and crannies of everyday life can be the very weapons that make you sick. But we’ve got you covered. Charles Gerba, a microbiologist and coauthor of “The Germ Freak’s Guide to Outwitting Colds and Flu,” reveals germ hotspots and how to disinfect them. Office break rooms DonNichols/iStockphoto \nRegularly wiping the cupboards, coffee pot, refrigerator, microwave and countertops slashes the number of viruses in the office, says Gerba, who suggests using disinfectant wipes from brands such as Clorox and Lysol. Discuss this policy with the office manager or maintenance staff, or do the wiping yourself. “During the cold and flu season, I’d certainly do it once in the morning and at lunchtime, and then in the midafternoon,” Gerba says. Computer desktop pkline/iStockphoto \nStudies show that office workers can touch about 40 objects per minute, Gerba says. So, if you poured coffee from the same pot as your sick co-worker, you likely brought those germs back to your desk. With those disinfectant wipes in hand, tackle your keyboard, mouse, computer and phone about once per day during cold and flu season. Sponges and sinks bagi1998/iStockphoto \nGross but true: “If you want to find fecal bacteria, go to the kitchen,” Gerba says, citing sponges and sinks as major culprits. Moist sponges are the perfect place for bacteria to grow, so each week, Gerba suggests either throwing them in the dishwasher, washing machine or even in the microwave on high for 30 seconds. Sinks should be washed with a disinfectant like Clorox about once a week, he adds. Cutting boards (iStockPhoto) \n“There’s about 400 times more fecal matter on a cutting board than on a toilet seat,” Gerba says. The problem is that many people will handle raw meat on a cutting board and merely rinse it before putting it away or cutting vegetables on it, creating what Gerba dubs “salmonella salad.” Disinfect these boards after every use, ideally by throwing them in the dishwasher. Even better: Assign one cutting board to meat and another to produce. Handheld electronics (iStockPhoto) \nPrepare for betrayal. Germs thrive on the e-reader you treasure, along with the tablet you saved up for and the phone you can’t put down. And think, when you place that phone to your mouth and breathe moist air, you’re asking for phone acne, or “ phacne .” Regularly wipe these electronics with disinfectants. Public transportation (iStockphoto) \nBuses and trains also make excellent homes for germs, which is probably not a surprise to folks who have sat beside someone who coughed through the commute, or have gripped a bar, railing or handle for stabilization. Anywhere from 400 to 1,000 people ride a city bus each day, Gerba says, and they’re bringing along their viruses. Your defense? Hand sanitizer – lots of it and frequently. Grocery stores and elevators (iStockPhoto) \nThese are other germy places where you should have sanitizer handy, especially after touching elevator buttons, grocery cart handles and self-checkout machines. Gerba doesn’t even use self-checkouts anymore after studying the germs that live on these screens. And speaking of shopping , when is the last time you’ve washed that reusable bag, which is exposed to all sorts of countertops and stores – not to mention bacteria from leaked groceries its held? Wash your go-to bags, if they’ll hold up, or consider replacing them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:50:18.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
