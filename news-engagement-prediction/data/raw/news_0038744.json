BBC Press Handout 10 Sheridan Smith starred in the drama about Shannon Matthews \nWere her mum Karen and her stepdad’s uncle Michael Donovan — both of low intelligence — really the only ones responsible for the twisted kidnap plot? \nThe finale, watched by 7.8million people this week, saw community campaigner Julie Bushby, played by Sheridan Smith, ask family liaison officer Det Con Christine Freeman if anyone else was involved. \nIn real life, both women said Matthews was “too stupid” to come up with the plot to take her daughter , hide her, then claim The Sun’s £50,000 reward for finding her. PA:Press Association 10 Shannon was ‘abducted’ by her mother who wanted to claim the reward money \nDespite rumours on the estate in Dewsbury, West Yorks, about who else may have been involved, relatives of Shannon yesterday insisted: “We had nothing to do with it.” \nCops arrested three family members over the fake abduction, including Amanda Hyett, 34. All were related to Shannon’s stepdad Craig Meehan, 31, and never charged. \nBut Amanda, her husband Neil and other members of their immediate family have remained under a cloud of suspicion. Louis Wood Karen’s relatives have remained under suspicion of helping her with the plot \nLast night, Neil, 45, broke his self-imposed silence to defend his wife. \nThe unemployed dad of three told The Sun: “We’ve had it all since Shannon went missing. People said all sorts. \n“I was never accused of being involved but Amanda got arrested. I know in my own heart she had nothing to do with it. \n“There’s no truth in it whatsoever. What people don’t understand is that it’s my kids that get it. Daily Mirror 10 Shannon’s grandma was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice \n“I’m old enough and ugly enough to take it. Amanda is how Amanda is but we had nothing to do with it.” \nPolice officially closed the £3.2million case in 2009 after Matthews, 41, and Donovan, 46, were jailed. \nBut some officers involved in the search remain far from convinced the pair had the capacity to act alone. related stories All you need to know about Karen Matthews – 'Britain's most hated mum' PERV'S EYE VIEW Shannon Matthews' paedo stepdad living in new home with bedroom that looks on to childrens' playground' MOORSIDE THEN AND NOW From Karen Matthews to Shannon's stepdad - where are the real Moorside 'cast' now shannon's prison Inside the den where Shannon Matthews was tied to a bed for 24 days by her mother and her accomplice CRUEL KIDNAPPER All you need to know about the man who conspired with Karen Matthews to kidnap her daughter Shannon 'CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE' Karen Matthews' pal insists evil mum wasn't 'smart enough' to mastermind kidnap plot 'SHE WASN'T AFTER MONEY' Julie Bushby says she KNOWS why best pal Karen Matthews lied about Shannon 'kidnap' 'FIND SHANNON' What happened to Shannon Matthews after the notorious fake kidnapping which gripped the nation? \nShannon, nine, vanished after school on February 19, 2008. \nShe was found alive 24 days later, having been held captive, drugged and tethered inside a divan bed at Donovan’s flat. \nDonovan planned to free Shannon at Dewsbury Market but the plot was foiled after officers forced their way into his grubby flat, less than a mile from the run-down Moorside estate where Shannon lived and found her. PA:Press Association/West Yorkshire Police Many officers don’t believe Karen had the intelligence to pull this off on her own Sunday Mirror Donovan was imprisoned for kidnap and false imprisonment \nThere was also a list of “rules” that Shannon had to obey. \nIt read: “You must not make any noise or bang your feet. You must not go near the windows. You must not go anywhere or do anything without me being here. Keep the TV volume low, up to volume 8 only.” \nAt the bottom of the note were the letters IPU — “I promise you” — a phrase she used with her mum. Donovan was arrested on suspicion of kidnap and false imprisonment. Full story of the case of Shannon Matthews and the lies told to police \nMatthews, played by Gemma Whelan in the BBC drama, tearfully confessed to her part after pal Natalie (Sian Brooke) became suspicious. \nBut in the days that followed, others on the estate were drawn in by a massive police dragnet. \nAmanda, who lived next door to Matthews, was quizzed on suspicion of assisting an offender. PA:Press Association Shannons stepdad was sentenced to five months for possessing indecent images of children \n\nCraig and Amanda’s mum Alice Meehan, 58, who also lived on the estate, was hauled in on suspicion of perverting the course of justice too. \nThey were bailed but rearrested a week later on suspicion of perverting the course of justice, along with Amanda’s sister, Caroline Meehan, 38. \nThe women have always insisted they had no involvement and have since moved three miles away to escape the gossip. Daily Mirror 10 Shannon's aunt Caroline was also arrested \nDefiant Neil said: “Everybody is going to have their own opinions on it so . . . I mean, we have our own opinions on Craig (Meehan). \n“What people don’t realise is it was about a little girl that went missing. Everybody else had children on the estate. \n“It wasn’t about the money. There was no reward money offered until The Sun came in at the end. So how could it have all been about money? Karen Matthews confesses to kidnapping daughter Shannon in The Moorside “I’m sure there were others involved. If there were, I’m not one of them. In the end it turned our lives upside down.” Neil added that he and Amanda watched The Moorside but described it as “an utter load of crap”.\nHe said: “It made us out to be complete and utter t**ts. We’re not. I was out for ever searching. \n“It was all about the community coming together but they didn’t show how people came from Barnsley, Sheffield, Newcastle to search. PA:Press Association 10 Sheridan Smith starred as Karen's best friend in the Moorside \n“They made it out that Julie Bushby did everything. She didn’t start helping until a week after Shannon had gone.” \nMatthews’ ex, Craig, was sentenced to five months after indecent images of children were found on his computer during the investigation.
