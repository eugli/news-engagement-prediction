After they reported for duty, as per norms, they were told to undertake breath analyser test. However, the findings were positive,” a source said. \nThe matter was reported to the DGCA and the two crew members were taken off for flying for three months, the source said. \nAir India spokesperson was not available for comments. \nAircraft rules prohibit crew members from taking any alcoholic drink 12 hours prior to the commencement of a flight, and it is mandatory for the employee to undergo an alcohol test both before and after operating a flight. \nAny crew member who tests positive in the pre-flight medical check or refuses to take a breath-analyser test is required to be taken off flying duty for at least four weeks and the airline is required to initiate disciplinary proceedings. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:37:27.337+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
