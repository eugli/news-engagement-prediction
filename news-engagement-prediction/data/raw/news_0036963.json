By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Thursday, February 16, 2017 - 19:09 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: Many illnesses, diseases and/or disorders come attached at the hip with numerous myths that range from normal to downright ridiculous. \nUnfortunately, like the saying goes, “A lie told often enough becomes the truth”, these myths too tend to carry on for so long that people blindly begin to believe in them. \nOne such disorder is attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Most people associate the problem in children with unsatisfactory parenting, which means that more often than not, the parents are blamed for something that is out of their control. \nHowever, a study has rubbished this association, saying that difficulty in maintaining attention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness in children with ADHD may be due to delayed development of five brain regions and not a case of bad parenting. \nThe findings, published in The Lancet Psychiatry, showed that in people with ADHD, the overall brain volume as well as nucleus accumbens, amygdala and hippocampus -- brain regions within the basal ganglia that controls emotion, voluntary movement and cognition -- remains smaller than those without the disorder. \nPrevious studies had showed that other brain regions such as caudate and putamen are also smaller in people with ADHD. \nFurther, these differences were most prominent in the brains of children with ADHD, and less obvious in adults with the disorder, a finding that might be important in challenging beliefs that ADHD is a label for difficult children or the result of poor parenting, the researchers said. \n\"The results from our study confirm that people with ADHD have differences in their brain structure and therefore suggest that ADHD is a disorder of the brain,\" said lead author Martine Hoogman at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands. \n\"We hope that this will help to reduce stigma that ADHD is 'just a label' for difficult children or caused by poor parenting,\" Hoogman added. \nSimilar differences in brain volume are also seen in other psychiatric disorders, especially major depressive disorder, the researchers said. \nFor the study, the team measured differences in the brain structure of 1,713 people with a diagnosis of ADHD and 1,529 people without, all aged between four and 63 years old. \n(With IANS inputs) First Published: Thursday, February 16, 2017 - 19:09 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T05:58:46.414+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
