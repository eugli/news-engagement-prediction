NC VWD was founded by Craig MacLellan who has a fully-qualified assistance dog called Boo \nExpress readers are today invited to play their part honouring this special covenant by voting for the worthy recipient of the Pets at Home Animal Partnership Award. \nThe suffering veterans bear can be heavy. \nMore die from suicides because of psychological and emotional trauma than are killed in conflict. \nOthers endure divorce, homelessness and imprisonment. \nThere are the recurring nightmares and the fear of stepping into the outside world. \nWorking as a team with a specially trained dog gives a veteran the gift of independence, increasing leisure and social participation, and helping them face stressful moments with less anxiety. \nFor the handler, training a dog requires commitment and an understanding that results are achieved slowly, but are both fun and rewarding as bonds are forged. \nThe charity said: “VWD uses positive, gentle training methods to achieve our goals. \n“The end product is a team: a person and a dog working together happily, totally in-tune and understanding each other completely.” VWD VWD VWD uses positive, gentle training methods \nThere is no charge for providing and training of a VWD assistance dog, although responsibility for keeping the animal and paying for its daily care falls on to the handler once it has been placed. \nIt is a small price. As one veteran explains: “Without veterans with dogs I wouldn’t be able to take my children out as I wouldn’t leave the house. \n“Everyone was walking on egg Shells. With the arrival of my dog, Scout, and the help and support of Veterans with Dogs, I am able to go about life as normally as it can be with invisible wounds.
