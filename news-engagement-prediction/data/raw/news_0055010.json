No taxpayer in Texas should have to subsidize this repugnant and illegal conduct. We should never lose sight of the fact that, as long as abortion is legal in the United States, the potential for these types of horrors will continue.\" \nYvonne Gutierrez, executive director of Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, said the provider \"will never stop fighting back against malicious, political attacks on Texans in need and Planned Parenthood health centers.\" \n\"We are thrilled with the court's decision to stop the state's attempt to bar 11,000 Texans from their provider of choice,\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, executive director of Planned Parenthood Texas Votes, in a prepared statement. \"Attempting to shut down Planned Parenthood health centers in Texas is part of an extreme agenda to ban abortion, and politicians are willing to strip away access to birth control, cancer screenings, and other vital health care in the process.\" \nTexas handed Planned Parenthood a final termination notice in December, a year after first publicizing intentions to remove the organization as a Medicaid provider. The notice cited an undercover video shot by anti-abortion activists as the foundation for cutting off all of the provider's Texas affiliates from Medicaid funding. \nThe eight-hour video showed Planned Parenthood employees at a Houston abortion clinic discussing how fetal tissue is collected for donations and used in research projects. The entire video was submitted as evidence in the case but attorneys played a small selection during court proceedings in January. \nThe state claimed Planned Parenthood was breaking the law by offering to alter abortion procedures to obtain specific quantities of tissue for research projects and that the provider was profiting from the sale of fetal tissue. Melissa Farrell, the employee captured on the tape, testified that she was only discussing modifying how the clinic handles tissue after an abortion, not changing the abortion procedure itself. \nPlanned Parenthood officials have also denied accusations that they sell fetal tissue. Attorneys for the provider said last month it only receives reimbursements for time, storage of tissue and the sterile equipment used in procedures where tissue will be donated to a research institution. \nStuart Bowen, inspector general for the Health and Human Services Commission, told Sparks last month that the video showed a willingness on the part of Planned Parenthood to alter procedures but that he did not have evidence of any physician actually changing an abortion. His termination letter to the organization said Planned Parenthood \"follows a policy of agreeing to procure fetal tissue, potentially for valuable consideration, even if it means altering the timing or method of an abortion.\" State official testifies he has no evidence Texas Planned Parenthood clinics altered abortion procedures \nDuring the January hearing on the case, Sparks urged attorneys to focus less on the undercover video and more on the services offered at Planned Parenthood clinics and whether there were other Medicaid providers the state could point to that offer comparable services. \nPlanned Parenthood reportedly served 11,000 women through Medicaid and received $4 million in Medicaid funding in 2015. Officials said if they were removed from the program these women would lose access to contraceptives, cancer screenings, HIV tests and other care. Nearly half of the provider's Texas clinics treat underserved communities. \nThe state argued that other Texas Medicaid providers offer similar services to Planned Parenthood, meaning patients wouldn't lose out on care if the organization was removed. \nJami Snyder, who oversees Medicaid for the Health and Human Services Commission, said there are 141,000 providers in Texas Medicaid but Planned Parenthood clinics are the only ones labeled \"family planning.\" \nOf the 4.3 million Texans enrolled in Medicaid, Snyder said 12,500 receive care from Planned Parenthood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:31:47.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
