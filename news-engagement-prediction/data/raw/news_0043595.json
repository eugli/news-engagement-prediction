The hotties, not the teens. NBC By Tess Koman Feb 21, 2017 Six teens fell through the ice covering the Central Park pond while trying to take a selfie Monday night, CBS New York reports. Two men skateboarding nearby saw the teens fall through and ran to help them — the boys, who were all 15 or 16 except for a 10-year-old in the bunch, were all rescued quickly enough they only suffered from mild hypothermia. All of them are expected to be released from the hospital today.

While the first four boys were relatively easy to save, two more sunk deeper under the ice. A post shared by @bennett_jonas on Feb 20, 2017 at 8:39pm PST “I swam out and grabbed the last two guys and was able to get them to shore and keep them alive,” Jonas captioned the above Instagram reflecting on his experience. “I feel humbled and grateful that God called me to be there tonight, I’m still shaking and am completely shook by what I experienced,” Jonas added. “But I’m alive and so are 6 other kids who got very lucky tonight.” In his own Instagram post, Turnbull wrote he was in the “right place right time” to help and said he couldn’t have done it without Jonas’s help.

Turnbull doesn’t look like anyone famous, but he’s from Australia and also very good-looking. Don't let anyone tell you there isn't any good left in this world. God bless. All best.
