Public Safety (@Arizona_DPS) February 12, 2017 Arizona Department of Public Safety Director Col. Frank Milstead said a suspect was firing at troopers before the crash occurred. The suspect was injured in the crash and no troopers were injured, the DPS said.\nThe DPS received reports that a red Mustang was driving recklessly southbound on Interstate 17 before 10 a.m. The Mustang crashed with another vehicle, and the Mustang driver, armed with a rifle, left his car and carjacked a white GMC sport-utility vehicle, the DPS said.\nTroopers pursued the stolen vehicle, and officials said the suspect fired at troopers during the chase. The suspect crashed the SUV in a head-on collision with a semi truck driving southbound on Interstate 17, about 15 miles south of Munds Park, according to the DPS.\nThe suspect was flown to a hospital with life-threatening injuries. The updated information provided in a DPS press release this afternoon corrected Milstead's earlier report that the suspect died in the crash.\nAll Law Enforcement officers involved are OK. Suspect is deceased from fatal crash.\n— Col.
