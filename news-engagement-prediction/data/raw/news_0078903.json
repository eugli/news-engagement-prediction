Dank tunnels, leaky tents, rainswept terrain. Late starts, late finishes and the assumption that sitting on the floor adds authenticity. Don’t even mention promenading. On the whole I’m up for it. That said, the idea of an operatic update of Snow White told by three different composers wasn’t altogether enticing. Such collaborations can lead to artistic timidity, or an inevitable preference for one element above another.\nFor its inaugural event, and with evident skill and professionalism, the Opera Story – co-founded and run by two volunteers who also have day jobs – has avoided these pitfalls. Their triple bill, entitled Snow , proved a strong and absorbing evening. Each short opera takes place on a different floor of Peckham’s Bussey Building . (No hanging around. The show began and ended on time. Bravo for that.) A gifted young cast of five and orchestra of 12 performed throughout, with Christopher Stark conducting and James Hurley directing.Rachel Szmukler’s designs, relying on simple props for the in-the-round setting, are given canny atmosphere by Ben Pickersgill’s lighting. With a text by the poet JL Williams, the operas overhaul the original fairytale, introducing violent contemporary attitudes and mercifully bypassing Disney.\nIt was as if Tansy Davies had put her head to the ground and recreated the roars and crackles of the forest\nThe Three Ravens tells of the adulterous king (Dutch baritone Rick Zwart ) revolted by his wife’s changing body as she progresses through pregnancy to give birth to her spotless child. Lewis Murphy ’s fluid, lyrical score uses baroque techniques, but there’s an air, too, of Tudor lute music, folding and unfolding in endless cadence. Next comes The Death of the Seven Dwarves by Lucie Treacher , dark as its title suggests, with propulsive, jerky rhythms and sparky, explosive percussion. Last is Tom Floyd ’s The Crystal Casket , in which the dead Snow White finds gorily redemptive love. We’re talking rotting bodies and coffins. Floyd’s multitextured writing makes a satisfying finale. All three composers have operatic experience: Murphy at Glyndebourne, Treacher with Tête à Tête opera festival, Floyd with Shadow Opera . The singers, led by British soprano Alice Privett , ardent and powerful in the title role, with Polly Leech compelling as Queen and Mother, have gained experience in those smaller British organisations with an eye to the future, British Youth Opera , Opera Holland Park , Garsington and Blackheath Halls among them. The final performances are on Wednesday and Friday.\n ‘Terrific’: Tamsin Waley-Cohen at Milton Court. Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer\nThe European Concert Hall Organisation (Echo) runs a Rising Stars season featuring performers “on the cusp of a major international career”. One of this year’s artists is the terrific British violinist Tamsin Waley-Cohen . The recitals always include a new composition. With pianist James Baillieu in a programme that included a febrile and rhapsodic account of Poulenc’s Violin Sonata, Waley-Cohen gave the London premiere of Oliver Knussen’s Reflection. In part a response to Gauguin’s painting of Breton women swimming, this beautifully crafted eight-minute work is made of tiny aural brushstrokes suggesting water: ripples mirroring each other and bursting out in expression and ecstatic high lines.\nWaley-Cohen’s companion Echo artist, the German pianist Christopher Park , gave the UK premiere of Trurl-Tichy-Tinkle by Olga Neuwirth (b1968). This piano piece is about things beginning with T. Where Knussen’s music was dense yet limpid, this was more splash and foam, with open octaves and scales and tremulous T-for-twiddles at either end of the keyboard. Park has virtuosic confidence and charm, but tends to let his left hand dominate. Rhythm wins over phrasing. So Beethoven (Sonata No 3, Op 10) brought to mind Stravinsky. Chopin, in Park’s own arrangement of the slow movement of the Piano Concerto No 2, also sounded somewhat like Stravinsky. Then Park played Three Movements from Petrushka , which is both by Stravinsky and sounded, dazzlingly, like him. The Echo series (continuing on 15 May) isn’t quite coherent in aim, which may explain the empty seats. Why were these two particular performers paired? Could the programme have united their considerable talents instead of dividing them into a double bill? Things to think about.\n Pianist Pierre-Laurent Aimard with the Philharmonia Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall. Photograph: Camilla Greenwell\nNo such problems with Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Philharmonia Orchestra ’ s programme in collaboration with Pierre-Laurent Aimard : he was soloist in Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No 5 “Emperor”, supple, commanding and, in the slow movement and its transition to the Rondo finale, fiercely poetic. The centrepiece was a new commission from Tansy Davies (premiered in Basingstoke earlier in the week). A former horn player, she showed her affinity for the instrument in Forest, a concerto for four horns. The soloists, playing mainly in consort, stride whooping, signalling, calling, through their own sonic landscape. Delicate tissues of sound, with glissandi and rapid trills across the entire ensemble, were offset by tangy percussion – drums and bells, tin cans, cabasa and rattle. It was as if the composer had put her head to the ground and recreated the roars and crackles of the forest.\nThis mighty Philharmonia concert ended with Richard Strauss’s Also sprach Zarathustra. There’s more, far more, after the famous “sunrise” of those opening bars (yes, Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey ). The orchestra and Salonen gave us the voluptuous and epic journey full-on. Everyone excelled, especially the strings, particularly the leader and the violas. To speak cinematically, they reached for the stars.\nStar ratings (out of 5)\nSnow ★★★★\nEcho Rising Stars ★★★\nPhilharmonia Orchestra/Salonen ★★★★\nClassical music The Observer Opera The Philharmonia
