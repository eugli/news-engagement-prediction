He will be sentenced Thursday. \nPolice said after the verdict that they would re-examine the 2010 death of Stewart's first wife. At the time it was ruled to be unexpected but from natural causes. \nThe body of 51-year-old Bailey was found in July in a cesspool under the garage of the home she shared with Stewart, alongside the body of her miniature dachshund Boris. Stewart had reported Bailey missing three months earlier. Children's author Helen Bailey was murdered by her partner Ian Stewart. (Twitter) \nBailey created the Electra Brown and Daisy Davenport series of novels for teenagers, and wrote a blog called Planet Grief after her husband of 22 years drowned during a Caribbean holiday in 2011. \nShe later met Stewart through a Facebook group for bereaved people. They began a relationship, and he became the chief heir to Bailey's fortune and gained power of attorney over her affairs. \nProsecutors said Stewart drugged Bailey over many weeks with his prescription anti-insomnia drug, possibly by slipping it into her morning scrambled eggs. \nShe grew alarmed by her deteriorating state of mind, searching online for terms such as \"can't stop falling asleep\" and expressing concern to loved ones. \nProsecutors said Stewart likely smothered Bailey with a pillow when she was sedated to gain her 3.3 million-pound (A$5.3 million) estate. \nCharles White of the Crown Prosecution Service said Stewart \"murdered Helen Bailey and then conducted a cynical, deceitful and calculated charade as he watched the police conduct a futile missing person investigation.\" Â© Nine Digital Pty Ltd 2017 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T22:04:17.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
