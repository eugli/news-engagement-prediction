(Jacob Langston/Orlando Sentinel) Cars head through a toll plaza on SR 408 heading West towards downtown Orlando on Monday, May 9, 2016. (Jacob Langston/Orlando Sentinel) (Jacob Langston / Orlando Sentinel) Kevin Spear Orlando Sentinel Privacy Policy \nThe region’s toll-road agency on Thursday will consider killing a big toll increase for drivers on its 109 miles of roads in the region. \nA 15 percent toll increase slated for July 1 was set in motion years ago when the Central Florida Expressway Authority was struggling financially. Axing the hike would hold down driving costs for both frequent and occasional travelers on toll roads in the Orlando area. \nThose using transponders and paying about $100 a month in tolls would be spared a total annual increase of nearly $200, according to the agency, while those who toss quarters into buckets would be spared a hike of 25 cents at typical toll plazas. \nThe move, if approved by the agency’s board, also would put in place annual increases beginning in July next year of 1.5 percent or an amount that reflects inflation. \n“I do believe this sends a message to the Central Florida community that we are thinking customer first, toll payer first, and gaining that public trust back,” said Jay Madara, a board member who helped craft the proposal. \n“It’s no secret the previous board was focused elsewhere as opposed to fiscal responsibility,” said Madara, chief financial officer for NBC’s Golf Channel, who was appointed to the agency board by Gov. Rick Scott in 2014. \nIn 2014, the toll-road agency was roiled by a corruption scandal that ultimately led to a bribery conviction and prison term for then-board member Scott Batterson. \nIn that same year, the Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority was restructured as the Central Florida Expressway Authority. Staffers and board members since then have stressed a need to regain public trust. \nDuring a meeting last month, when Mayor Buddy Dyer was chosen as the agency’s chairman, board members noted that the toll hike is pending even though the agency is enjoying solid financial footing. \nDyer directed the expressway authority to pair staff and Madara, the agency’s newly seated treasurer, in an examination of tolls. \n“There may be opportunity to take a more moderate approach to the upcoming increase as well as toll rates in future years,” he said. A spokeswoman for Dyer would not say whether he will vote against the 15 percent increase, elaborating that he is “looking forward to furthering this discussion with the board.” \nOrange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs , another member of the authority’s board, could not be reached for comment. \nMadara said the 15 percent hike would boost annual revenue by about $60 million. \nEven so, he said, the agency’s construction projects, bond ratings and overall financial health aren’t likely to be affected by rejecting the planned hike. \nCostly work ahead includes the Wekiva Parkway, State Road 408 interchange with Interstate 4 and widening State Road 417. \nMadara said he thinks the board will back the proposal. \n“I’m hard pressed to see why anybody would not want to be in favor,” he said. \nkspear@orlandosentinel.com \nTolls were hot issue in 2012 » Caption Charges won't be filed against Markeith Loyd's niece \nMarkeith Loyd's niece, Lakensha Smith-Loyd, is no long facing charges of aiding the accused copy killer.
