But if you were listening for the views of the business community, two moments stood out. The first was James Eddy , who came with a folder containing the names of 700 local, mainly small, businesses who signed up with the Jacksonville Coalition for Equality in support of the expansion. Enlarge R_DREWEK/ISTOCK/THINKSTOCK The second, an hour or so later, was the brief comments by Darnell Smith, Florida Blue market president and 2017 Jax Chamber chair, who also supports the expansion: Corporations coming to Jacksonville often ask if the city provides protection for all citizens. “Right now, we can’t say we do,” he said. In between those comments was plenty of impassioned arguments on both sides of the issue. But for all of the energy that opponents of the bill spent arguing that the city’s businesses would suffer under an expanded HRO — that business owners must be allowed the unfettered exercise of their freedom of conscious for the area’s economy to grow — few, if any, actual business owners stepped forward to plead economic harm. Dealing with concerns That’s not to say that there are not small-business owners who are worried about the ordinance’s impact on their businesses, including some who might not want to take the public opprobrium that comes with stepping forward. We do not mean to belittle those worries; it’s understandable that some entrepreneurs who have invested their lives in a business now fear the heavy hand of even more regulation descending upon them. But it must be acknowledged that the crafters of the expanded ordinance have taken those fears into account, including by exempting businesses with fewer than 15 employees from the law. It’s also worthwhile for a nervous business owner to ask his or herself if they have actual concrete worries or are tapping into some imaginary narrative. Are you kicking patrons out of your shop now because a man comes in with his boyfriend? Do you spend a lot of time even thinking about the sexual orientation or birth gender of your customers? One of the arguments often made against expanding the HRO is that Jacksonville doesn’t need such a law because it’s a welcoming, inclusive place. If you believe that truly does describe the city — and we believe it often does — the expansion shouldn’t worry you. ‘Too busy to hate’ With those fears aside, we return to the arguments alluded to by Eddy and Smith: Expanding the human rights ordinance is an economic good as well as a moral good. For years, urban planners have pointed to the value that the generally LGBTQ-friendly “creative class” brings to a city. Economists have show the value of businesses being diverse and welcoming. That’s the carrot. The stick is the harm that ensues if Jacksonville joins the ranks of Indiana and North Carolina, places whose commitment to non-equality led to canceled conventions, stalled expansions and other blows to the revenue being brought in by both businesses and governments. Economic reasons are not the key driver behind expanding the HRO: A belief in human dignity and equality is. But just as Atlanta saw success by being the “city too busy to hate,” the desire to grow Jacksonville’s economy and stature should be a motivation. If the human rights argument doesn’t sway you, look at the $60 million Indiana lost due to the controversy around its religious objections law, think of the $630 million hit to North Carolina’s economy in the wake of the passage of HB2. Next steps In some ways, this entire editorial is preaching to the choir. As we talk to businesses, large and small, there is clearly widespread support of the expansion. If you’re not in that group, our hope is that you take the thoughts laid out above to heart. But for those of you who have been nodding in agreement the entire time, we have a charge for you, too: If you believe expanding the HRO is the right thing to do, if you believe in the economic benefits, if you support human rights — it’s time to stand up, to speak out. Appearing before City Council or signing up with the Coalition for Equality is, in some ways, the easy step. You’ve placed your flag. Now take the next step. Educate your peers. Educate your customers. Contact your district councilmember. Use your political weight. If the HRO expansion fails this time, Jacksonville goes from being the last major city in the state without such protections to being the only major city in Florida that has decisively rejected them. That’s a position we do not want to be in. It’s incumbent upon those who see themselves as business leaders to make sure that doesn’t happen.
