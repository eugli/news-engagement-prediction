Former Cowboy Tautau Moga was training at left centre inside Corey Oates on Monday morning. It is a surprising inclusion given how well David Mead performed in the pre-season. Jordan Kahu has been relegated to the wing outside James Roberts despite showing his great potential as a centre at this year’s Nines. \nBrisbane could also be without a utility for their season opener. Kodi Nikorima was training with the reserve grade players at Monday’s session while Benji Marshall (Achilles) was with the recovery group. Josh McGuire will take over from retired skipper Corey Parker at lock. Forward Joe Ofahengaue also trained with the reserve grade players, with Herman Ese’ese , Tevita Pangai Jnr and Jai Arrow all looking to be favourites to join Alex Glenn on the bench. \n— Rikki-Lee Arnold \n6pm AEDT Friday, Belmore Sports Ground \nBulldogs: To come \nRABBITOHS V TIGERS \n8:05pm AEDT Friday, ANZ Stadium \nRabbitohs: The Rabbitohs’ playmaking picture remains unclear, with Luke Kelly and Damien Cook the contenders to replace injured halfback Adam Reynolds . Back-rower John Sutton is another option to play in the halves, which would see Cody Walker switch to halfback. \n“If he puts me back there I’ve played there a lot, I don’t mind going back and playing in the halves,” Sutton said on Monday. \nTigers: Hooker Matt Ballin , returning from a second knee reconstruction, was again limited in what he could do at training on Monday morning. \nShould he miss the Souths clash, Matt McIlwrick will be starting hooker. \nTeenage rookie Moses Suli also spent a lot of time training on the left wing and is pressing for a possible start against fellow debutant Braidon Burns. \n— Christian Nicolussi \n4:30pm AEDT Saturday, UOW Jubilee Oval \nDragons: To come", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T02:10:33.110+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
