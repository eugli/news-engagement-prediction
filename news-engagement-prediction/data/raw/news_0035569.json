Tidal launched hi-res MQA streams with its Tidal Masters catalogue earlier this year. \nUniversal Music's artists include Robbie Williams, Meat Loaf, Miles Davis, Robert Plant and The Eagles. \nMike Jbara, CEO of MQA, commented, \"We're very pleased to be working with Universal Music to achieve our goal of moving studio-quality sound into the mainstream. Universal's timeless catalogue and impressive artist roster will fuel music streaming services worldwide and enable the premium listening experience for all music fans.\" \nMQA recently partnered with Tidal to improve its 'Tidal Masters' service, adding MQA encoded audio to music from Beyonce, Bruno Mars, Coldplay, David Bowie, and others. Expect to see more hi-res music on Tidal - and perhaps other streaming services - thanks to this new deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:06:18.689+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
