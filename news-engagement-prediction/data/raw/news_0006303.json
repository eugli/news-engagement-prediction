I can tell you that she is really a grassroots leader,\" he said. \nJamilah was not present at the announcement. \nThe Tanjong Datu state seat fell vacant when Adenan died from heart complications on Jan 11. \nNomination for the by-election is on Saturday while polling has been fixed on Feb 18.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:18:55.290+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
