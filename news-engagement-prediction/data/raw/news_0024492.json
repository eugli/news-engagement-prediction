Government Loses Brexit Vote Appeal Tue, January 24, 2017 Britain's most senior judges ruled that Prime Minister Theresa May does not have the power to trigger the formal process Article 50 for the UK's exit from the European Union without Parliament having a say. PA 1 of 12 Issued by the Supreme Court of (top row, from the left) Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance, Lord Kerr, Lord Sumption, (bottom row, from the left) Lady Hale, Lord Clarke, Lord Wilson and Lord Hodge, who agreed with the majority decision that the Government could not trigger Article 50 without Parliamentary approval. BBC The Torquay audience did not respond well to Smith's Brexit forecast \nMr Whittle said: “Owen on this programme last year, you said… you would absolutely ignore the vote. \n“We’ve got Claire here - part of a political class that’s doing everything it can… to delay and prevaricate. \n“You are treating people like they are stupid - they knew exactly what they were voting for, they knew we were coming out of the single market. \n“They knew all of these things, and this is a condescending argument we’re having now.” \nFormer Tory MP Ann Widdecombe joined the attack on Smith, telling the audience: “Owen’s position is very clear. \n“We will have a referendum - if you don’t give us the answer we want, we’ll have another one!” \nThis is the second time this week Owen Smith has attacked Brexit and refused to accept the outcome of the referendum. \nSpeaking in the Commons as MPs debated the Article 50 Bill, he said: “I sincerely believe Brexit is going to be a disaster for our country, one that is going to cost us and future generations in lost trade, in lost revenue and in lost opportunities. BBC Ann Widdecombe suggested the Labour MP was unwilling to accept the referendum result \n“I equally believe it is a disaster for us to be dividing the country as we have done on this issue, on our values, on the crucial things we often hold in concept. \n“I also think it is deeply destructive for us to have engaged in Brexit and unleashed a catalytic force of, in my view, destructive politics not just in this country but across the West.” \nDespite his Brexit attack, Theresa May’s Bill passed through the Commons without any amendments and is now set to be debated by the House of Lords.
