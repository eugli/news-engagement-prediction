That's ridiculous, I should know. All my life my mother has told me it was fashionable at the time.'\" Sir Patrick on the BBC show Who Do You Think You Are? Credit: Andrew Montgomery \nH e added: \"I happened to be seeing my doctor the next day for a check-up so while he was down there I said, 'By the way, my wife and I have had a little disagreement, I am circumcised, aren't I?' \n\"He took a closer look and said: 'Not! I am Jewish, and definitely know the difference!'\" \nRegretting his candid admission while on the BBC TV chat show's couch, Sir Patrick said: \"Oh no, my grandchildren will be watching this!\" \nSir Patrick, who married wife Sunny Ozell in 2013 and was previously married twice before then, did not reveal when he learned of his lack of circumcision. \nThe actor was joined on the programme by his X-Men co-stars Hugh Jackman and Sir Ian McKellen, as well as singer-songwriter James Blunt. He confirmed that his last appearance in the franchise is the newest film Logan. Star Trek: the movies - in chronological order \nL ogan also marks Jackman's last film in the franchise in the role of Wolverine/Logan. \nSir Patrick, who plays Professor X in the film series, said: \"Last week we were at a screening in Berlin sitting next to each other and when it got to the very emotional ending and I noticed Hugh wipe away a tear, then I did the same and during the credits he held my hand and I was done, I was weeping and sobbing. \n\"While the credits were rolling I realised that if it was the end, there was no more perfect and beautiful way to say, 'au revoir, goodbye, adios.'\" \nHe said: \"So I think it is the end for me, too. \n\"Why would I want to have another go of it after what we have done in this movie?\" \nThe Graham Norton Show airs on BBC One, Friday February 24 at 10.35pm Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:14:54.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
