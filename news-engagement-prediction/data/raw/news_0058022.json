They asked for donations to be made to the Dementia Research Centre at the National Hospital for Neurology & Neurosurgery in London. \nFronto-temporal dementia, which is typically diagnosed in people aged between 45 and 65, is sometimes called Pick's disease and affects the parts of the brain that control behaviour, emotions and language.
