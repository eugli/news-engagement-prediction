It’s the birthplace of some of the all-time great classic cocktails, the city where Mardis Gras stretches on for nearly two months, and a place where it’s not only legal, but totally acceptable, to walk around drinking a giant daiquiri from a styrofoam cup. \nSo you better believe New Orleans knows a thing or two about about crippling hangovers and how to get rid of them. \nThat’s why we asked Amanada and Isaac Toups of one of our favorite New Orleans restaurants, Toups’ Meatery , their favorite hangover cure. Their Cajun-style baked eggs have tons of heavy cream and cheese curds to sooth your soul, and just enough spicy andouille sausage and Jalapeño Tabasco to wake your ass up. RECIPE: Cajun-Style Baked Eggs \nBest of all, like any great homemade hangover cure, they’re so easy to make that you won’t mess them even if your barely functioning brain is running on reserve power. And i f for some reason these eggs don’t do the trick, you can always make yourself a NOLA-sized daiquiri , because hair of the dog never fails.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T23:06:49.811+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
