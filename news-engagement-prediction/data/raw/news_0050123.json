New photos from the crime scene of Kim Kardashian ’s terrifying Paris robbery were revealed in a French TV news report on Sunday, February 19, and some of the images are downright disturbing. \nFrance’s TF1 news station flashed several photos of Kardashian’s bedroom at a Paris hotel, her white bedding rumpled and one bedside lamp turned on.
