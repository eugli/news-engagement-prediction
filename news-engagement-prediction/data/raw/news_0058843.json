The Australian fitness blogger and registered nurse usually garners positive reactions for the snapshots of her feeding her 16-month-old son, Madden, but when one Instagram troll called her photos \"gross\" and \"weird,\" Nadine knew she had to take a stand. \nThe Aussie mom posted a slideshow of various breastfeeding photos with the most glorious caption ever. \"There is nothing 'weird' or 'gross' about these photos,\" she wrote. \"There's no difference in me feeding my child with my breast than someone feeding him/herself with a spoon!\" \nNadine went on to stand up for a mother's right to share such photos publicly. \"How about we simply appreciate that any mother has options, the right to her own choices, to feel supported and respected, the right to not have to hide, in fact the right to SHARE and POST proudly if she feels comfortable to do so!\" ADVERTISEMENT \nShe explained that moms don't share breastfeeding photos for attention or to make a statement. Rather, \"They post because they are #proud, to give other mums encouragement,\" she wrote. \"They post so that other mums feel accepted, supported, and respected.\" Nadine said that nursing is a \"beautiful act\" that demonstrates a bond between a mother and her baby, and that bond should be openly celebrated. We couldn't agree more! \nNadine ends her message on an encouraging note, advising mamas everywhere to post photos of them feeding their children, whether it be by breast, bottle, or spoon, using the hashtag #wefeedunited.
