'Money was mine' \nMr Kilroy, from Stockport, was given a behind the scenes tour of the breakfast show with his granddaughter Eve following a day-long auction to raise money for the BBC charity. \nHe said: \"I found a wallet lying in the street and handed it into police and a year after that police got in touch with me to say the money was mine. \n\"There was a library card in there but nobody came forward.\" \n\"I thought it'd be great to see the programme going out - I really enjoyed it,\" added Dave, who ferries children around Cheshire and Greater Manchester as a school bus driver. \nAs of October 2016, there were 254 projects worth £13.1m being supported by BBC Children in Need across the North West of England.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:38:32.793+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
