Until now. Enlarge Image Nintendo \nNintendo 's NES Classic was a reminder of how great the NES was. One game developer in Japan is hoping to remind everyone about another classic Nintendo device: the Famicom Disk System. \nFor those not across Japan's '80s gaming scene, the Famicom Disk System was a peripheral to the NES (which in Japan was called the Famicom) that used rewriteable floppy disks to play games. Gamers in Japan could take the 32KB disks to kiosks in stores, delete the game currently held within and get a new one loaded on. \nFor the first time in over 20 years, the Disk System's library is growing. \nDeveloper Hawken King, through his one-man company Dadako , made a Pang-inspired game called Pirate Pop Plus . The game is playable on Wii U, 3DS and Windows via Steam -- but its chiptune soundtrack was designed for the Famicom Disk System. \nDeveloper Hawken King last October released a Pang-inspired game called Pirate Pop Plus for the Wii U, 3DS and Windows. Now, King is releasing a special collectors item: a chiptune soundtrack for his game designed for the Famicom Disk System.
