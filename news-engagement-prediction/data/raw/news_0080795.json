When you see Nathaniel Clyne pull out a rabona when you're 3-0 down. Image: PA \nHowever, none of the usual high intensity elements of Liverpool's game were evident, with Leicester outplaying a team that looked like they'd turned up for an evening stroll in La Manga rather than a Premier League game. \nAfter the match, Klopp was blunt in his assessment of his team during an interview with Sky Sports. \n\"If we make our best game and play really good and we lose I have to accept it, that's football . We did not do enough. It looked like we'd never spoken about the strength of Leicester. That's the real problem. \n\"I spoke in the dressing room about it. That's not enough, for sure. That's not even close to being enough. \n\"We have to work, obviously and try with everything we have to do better next time. It is really hard to see what we would usually be able to do in this performance. Jamie Vardy opens the scoring in the first half. Image: PA \n\"Not good in offence, not good in defence - that's how you lose football games. There is no reason at this moment for this. You can always find excuses but I am not ready to look for an excuse.\" \n\"Thank God we don't have to play again tomorrow. After you win and you lose you have to analyse, show the boys and react on it again.\" \nLiverpool's next match sees top six rivals Arsenal visit Anfield on Saturday evening in what is now a must win game for Klopp's men.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T11:00:14.973+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
