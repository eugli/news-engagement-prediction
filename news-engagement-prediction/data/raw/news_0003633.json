And celebratory. T-Mobile/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nYou'd think T-Mobile would've at least been tempted to slam Verizon. Or at least AT&T. \nThis has been rather the thing for the slightly lesser cell phone carriers. \nSprint, for example, is insisting that bad parents will fake their own deaths in order to get out of a Verizon contract. And this they're putting in front of the Super Bowl audience . \nOddly, however, T-Mobile has suddenly turned positive. At least for a day. \nIts Super Bowl ad sees the greatest living Canadian Justin presenting a little history of the touchdown celebration. \nI am, of course, referring to Justin Bieber, rather than prime minster Justin Trudeau. Bieber, I feel, would not write a rhythmic ode to Fidel Castro . \nBieber, a self-styled celebration expert, is here in a tuxedo, while the New England Patriots' Rob Gronkowski is a caveman. Some feel this entirely encapsulates at least half of NFL players. \nBut not former San Francisco 49ers receiver contestant Terrell Owens, who also makes an appearance with his well-worn act. \nBieber is quite winning in this performance. It's heartening to know that he has a future in the dramatic arts. \nNaturally, this being a Super Bowl ad, there has to be a small child to win your heart. And this little girl upstages Bieber and the NFL types with sheer exuberance and the wit of, well, at least a tweenager.
