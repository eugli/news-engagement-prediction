The Pokkiri actor is joining hands with Atlee for a Tamil film. Post Atlee's project, Ilayathalapathy is teaming up with AR Murugadoss for the third time for Vijay 62. \nWhile the shooting of Vijay 61 is going in full swing, it is rumoured that the Theri actor is playing a cop after Pokkiri, Thuppakki and Theri. \nAccording to Behindwoods , the project is likely to feature Vijay in multiple roles and that he would be donning a khaki for one of the roles. \nA picture of Vijay on the sets of the film went viral on the internet. The team is currently shooting in Madurai. \nProduced by Sri Thenandal Films, the highlight of the film is its huge cast, which includes Kajal Aggarwal, Samantha, Nithya Menen, SJ Suryah and Sathyaraj. \nTo be made on a lavish budget, Academy Award-winner AR Rahman is on board to compose the music. \nMagadheera, Baahubali and Bajrangi Bhaijaan writer KV Vijayendra Prasad has penned the script for the film. \nDespite opening to poor reviews from critics and audience, Vijay's Pongal release Bairavaa is the first Tamil film to gross Rs 100-crore mark this year.
