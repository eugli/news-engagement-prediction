(Other women and civil rights leaders would be added to the $5 and $10 notes.) Jackson, infamous for the removal of Cherokees from their land in the Trail of Tears, resulting in many deaths of Native Americans, also enslaved people of African descent, while endearing himself to the \"common [white] man\" and honored as a war hero. Jackson would move to the back of the bill in a smaller image along with an image of the White House.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T19:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:48:49.874+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
