He has built border fences to try to keep them out. Hungary's government 'cannot risk changing the fundamental ethnic character of the country,' he said. Orban said in a speech to the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry that 'too much mixing causes trouble' He added: 'That would not enhance the value of the country but downgrade it instead, and toss it into chaos.' He also claimed that limited diversity was culturally important because 'the problem of parallel societies is undesirable,' an allusion to worries that societies unable to integrate migrants can increase crime levels and terrorism. Hungary, an EU member with a record-low unemployment rate of just above four percent, is facing an acute shortage of workers, with many employers saying they are struggling to fill vacancies. He has called the wave of migrants into Europe since 2015 a threat to the continent's cultural and religious heritage But Orban warned against a recourse to so-called 'guest worker' programmes, saying he would support them only on an ad hoc basis for short-term contracts. 'I would not like to see the country drift toward a situation where lower-skilled work would only be carried out by foreigners,' he said. 'We ourselves have to do the work required to keep our country going, from scrubbing toilets to nuclear science,' he said.
