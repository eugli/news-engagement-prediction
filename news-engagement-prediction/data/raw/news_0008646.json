Ciaran Evans at Baguettes of Broadway \n“Obviously we accepted this and will be making him full meals all week. I don’t know this lady’s full name only that’s she’s called Bev. \n“It touched my heart and thought she should have some recognition for her kindness.

All this happened because of one woman – it’s so nice to see there are still good people out there.” \nBev’s money has been donated to a Manchester-based volunteers organisation Streets Ahead, which Baguettes of Broadway will be working with in the future. \nAnyone wanting to support Streets Ahead can drop off donations at the cafe shop, and they will be passed on. \nAre you ‘Bev’ or do you know the brothers in this story?
