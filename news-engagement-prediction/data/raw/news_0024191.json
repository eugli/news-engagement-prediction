Prior to this, only the pricing and and a few key specifications of three of AMD’s highest performing Ryzen CPUs were listed on the database of several distributors and retailers (more on that here ). \nInterestingly, AMD Ryzen’s family of processors will consist of 10 CPUs. Each will apparently come with a minimum of four CPU cores (up to eight) and at least 3.2GHz of base clock speed (up to 3.6GHz). It’s worth noting that AMD will be mimicking Intel’s naming scheme; separating its Ryzen processors into three groups: Ryzen 3, Ryzen 5, and Ryzen 7. Image: Overclock3D Image: Overclock3D \nThe most affordable Ryzen 3 1100, will be slapped with an incredibly modest price tag of 999 Chinese Yuan (about RM645). Meanwhile, the Ryzen 5 1600X processor, which may become a favourite amongst many PC gamers, will come with a price tag of 1,999 Chinese Yuan (around RM1,291). \nThat said, the price of AMD’s most powerful Ryzen processor, Ryzen 7 1800X, seems to be slightly higher in this leak. The eight core processor has been listed on this leak with a price of 4,399 Chinese Yuan (approximately RM2,842). It’s worth noting, however, that the earlier leak of $490 (about RM2180) was listed with US pricing, which may explain thee difference. Rumour: AMD's Zen-Based Summit Ridge Processors Will Have Dedicated Overclocking Segment Image: Overclock3D \nRegardless, I do strongly recommend our dear readers to take this enticing leak with a handful of salt, at least until AMD makes an official announcement – which should come sooner rather than later.
