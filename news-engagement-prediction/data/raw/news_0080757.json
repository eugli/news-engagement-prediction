It must keep all work in Newton Aycliffe, and surplus profits will be invested in community groups such as a local football team. His company built the first British washing machine in 40 years (Picture: Ebac) \nHis company builds products including humidifiers and air conditioners. Ebac also designed and built the first British washing machine in 40 years. \nParents promise to find out truth about death of two daughters in Vietnam Mr Elliott hit out at the political push for more and more people to go to university, saying his ‘biggest regret’ was leaving school at 15 – because he should have left at 13. \n‘The wrong idea was that we should make everyone in Britain very, very clever so we wouldn’t need to do any hard work,’ he told the BBC, saying that many people in the UK were happy doing work that does not require extensive qualifications. \nDescribing his own workers, he claimed: ‘They are not very ambitious but they’re not second-class citizens, and there are a lot of them in the UK. He described his workers as ‘not second class citizens (Picture: YouTube/RecognitionPR) \n‘They are reasonably well motivated, but they’re at a low skill level.’ \nMr Elliot has previously spoken out against a national minimum wage, saying it hinders business owners. \nHe has also been outspoken in support of Brexit.
