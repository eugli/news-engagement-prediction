(Shawn Inglima/for New York Daily News) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS  37 PM \nThe New Jersey woman who fell to her death from an escalator at the Oculus transit hub was apparently horsing around on the handrail, mimicking a superhero before she lost her balance, a source said Sunday. \nOfficials who saw video of the tragic accident said victim Jenny Santos, 29, fell 34 feet early Saturday after laying prone on the banister of the escalator with her arms spread-eagle, like she was pretending to be flying, the source said. \nSeconds later, Santos lost her balance and plunged from the street level to the C1 level on the main concourse, where she hit her head on the marble floor, the source said. \nEarlier, officials had said Santos fell around 5:30 a.m. while stretching to grab her twin sister’s falling hat while the two were riding the escalator en route to a train to take them back to their home in Kearny, N.J. \nOfficials said the hat was still somehow involved, but those details were unclear. Jenny Santos, a phys ed, health and driver’s education instructor, was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where she could not be saved. \nSantos, a phys ed, health and driver’s education instructor, was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where she could not be saved. \nA spokeswoman for the city’s chief medical examiner said Santos died from blunt-impact injuries to her head and torso. \nThe spokeswoman said the results of any toxicology tests that may be conducted would not change the cause-of-death determination. \nAs Santos’ heartbroken family dealt with the death of the woman described as an outgoing adventurer, attention began to shift to the design of escalators at the $4.4 billion facility. Santos lost her balance and plunged from the street level to the C1 level on the main concourse, where she hit her head on the marble floor. (Alex Rud/for New York Daily News) \nSome passengers wondered if the glass barriers running alongside the escalator should be higher. \n“If I was taller, I might be a little more wary,” said Vanessa Chang, 32, who was carrying her Teacup Yorkie in a handheld container. “I was worried about the dog. If I was holding a kid, I’d be nervous.” \n“They should definitely make it higher, but with a place to hold on with your arms,” said a transit supervisor at the Fulton St. station who declined to give her name. \nThe Daily News measured the guardrails at the Oculus and Fulton St. stations and found they are 3 feet, 4 inches tall. Front page of the New York Daily News for February 12, 2017: OCULUS DEATH PLUNGE (New York Daily News) \nThe glass portion of the partition is 2 feet. The railing is another inch, and the rubber covering is about 4 inches. \nMost visitors to the Oculus said they were comfortable with the current escalator dimensions. \n“It’s like people paying attention in the theater by the balcony,” said Charlie Carson, 62, a legal secretary from SoHo. “It was an accident. You could make a real good case that when there’s a drop like that the barrier should be higher. I can see how someone reaching for their hat could fall over. \n“I’m wondering if the insurance companies warned them when it was installed. That’s what makes them more liable. But like anything, if you let your guard down, something happens.” \nNeither the governor’s office nor the Port Authority responded to questions about escalator safety. Architect Santiago Calatrava could not be reached for comment.
