Chris Breen \nForty years ago, the contestants launch themselves from a platform on the wharf. \nIn 1976, Chris Breen and Nick Webb entered the Murrays Bay contest with a group of workmates. \nREAD MORE: \nBreen said the bamboo, plastic and masking tape creation was designed before the event but put together at the wharf on the day. Chris Breen \nThe team of six birdmen go crashing into the bay. \nHe estimated the group would have been in their early 20s at the time and admits the jump took a little liquid courage. \nTeammate and pilot, Webb, said the idea came from workplace antics. \n\"Towards the end of the week, when there wasn't much to do, we'd make paper planes and throw them out of the window,\" Webb said. Chris Breen \nBirdmen and their flying machine are rescued from the waters of the bay after a short flight. \n\"We'd already perfected a few models.\" Ad Feedback \nThe pair has fond memories of the day that ended with a splash. \n\"We were there to have fun. If we got 10 metres, that's great. But we didn't,\" Webb said. ZIZI SPARKS/FAIRFAX NZ \nNick Webb, left, and Chris Breen revisit Murrays Bay where they jumped from the wharf during the original 1976 birdman competition. \n\"The other thing I recall, vaguely, is I heard this huge roar as we jumped.\" \nIt was the crowd cheering. \nBreen, who lived in Glenfield at the time, said the group also entered the following year constructing their flying machine beforehand using aluminium tubing. \n\"My recollection, I was the photographer, is I remember the place was packed. You couldn't move.\" \nWebb said, despite the extra planning and effort the second year, the group went just as far - that is, not very. \n\"It doesn't make a difference. The second year we had more effort but it was still just a big kite,\" he said. \n\"My advice is treat it as fun and don't spend a lot of money because it's likely to turn to custard.\" \nBack in the 70s, the birdmen and women launched themselves off an extended platform but this year, they will be aided by a ramp. \nJosie Adriaansen, the chairwoman of the Murrays Bay Residents' Association, which is organising the event, said the association had been asked to put on such an event in the past and decided to do so to officially celebrate the new wharf which opened in October 2016. \n\"These days, people are too busy and community events are not happening enough,\" she said. \nEntry to the 2017 competition is due by March 16 and the event will be held on April 1, with a safety briefing at 11.30am, a parade at 12.30pm and takeoff at 1pm. \nFor information and to enter, visit mbwbirdman.co.nz. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T10:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T06:14:33.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
