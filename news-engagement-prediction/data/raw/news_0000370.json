Five days later, a man spotted Johnson’s car and recognized it from an Amber Alert. He called 911 and trailed the couple from gas station to gas station until police arrived. After Johnson was placed in custody, an officer called Nora and let her speak with her daughter. Nora said, She said, ‘Momma, I just want to come home,’ She said she saw us on the news and she said she was okay. She said she was all right.
