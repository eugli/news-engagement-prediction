Bush waited more than two-and-a-half years. \nThe debate took place while thousands rallied outside Parliament in an anti-Trump protest chanting “Hey hey, hey ho; Trump and Brexit’s got to go,” and “No Trump, no Brexit; no racist EU exit.” \nLabour’s Dawn Butler said the US had a “pretty nasty virus, and it’s important that virus doesn’t spread.” \nFormer Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond also slammed May’s apparently submissive attitude towards the controversial President. \n“As an example of fawning subservience, the Prime Minister holding hands [with Trump] would be difficult to match,” he said. \n“To do it in the name of shared values was stomach churning. What exactly are the shared values that this house, this country would hope to have?” Salmond said. \nA number of Conservative MPs did however stand by their leader’s decision, arguing May is correct to foster good relations with one of the UK’s oldest allies.
