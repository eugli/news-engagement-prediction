Stefano Brizzi murdered PC Gordon Semple at his south London flat last April after meeting him on gay dating app Grindr. He is understood to have taken his own life at Belmarsh high-security prison in south-east London yesterday. The 50-year-old Breaking Bad obsessive, who was addicted to crystal meth, attempted to dispose of PC Semple's body using an acid bath like that in the US TV series. Other parts of the PC's body were roasted, boiled and eaten with chopsticks before police were alerted to the foul stench from Brizzi's flat, a court heard. In December last year, Brizzi was handed a life sentence today and ordered to serve at least 24 years behind bars. An England and Wales Prison Service spokesperson said today: 'HMP Belmarsh prisoner Stefano Brizzi died in custody on Sunday 5 February. 'As with all deaths in custody there will be an independent investigation by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman.'
