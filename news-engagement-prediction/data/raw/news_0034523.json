There is nothing which stops his ministers from going a step further and trying to attempt a religious polarisation,” he said. \nHe said the statement “smacks of desperation” and of the fact that BJP has lost the plot. \n“...and It smacks of the fact that for all the tall talk about development, ultimately the BJP comes back to its basic DNA and that basic DNA is to try and garner electoral benefit out of religious polarisation,” he said. \nTewari said the statement made by the Minister of State for Home Affairs or the tweet he has put out was not limited to Arunachal Pradesh alone. \n“If you read that tweet, the intent is implicit in it but the fact remains that when a Minister of the Union makes such an irresponsible statement, he must be held to account,” he said. \nThe Congress leader said when suddenly “you wake up in the morning and shoot from the hip, this is the conduct which is unbecoming of a Minister”. \n“So, the only thing which seems to be decreasing, is the intellectual quotient of the NDA-BJP Ministers,” he said. \nEarlier, Rijiju through a series of tweets claimed that Hindu population was decreasing in India as they “never convert people”, while minorities are flourishing unlike some other countries. \n“Hindu population is reducing in India because Hindus never convert people. Minorities in India are flourishing unlike some countries around (sic),” he tweeted. Hindu population is reducing in India because Hindus never convert people.

People of Arunachal Pradesh are unitedly living peacefully with each other (sic). \n“Congress should not make such provocative statements. India is a secular country. All religious groups enjoy freedom & living peacefully (sic),” he said in a series of tweets, responding to the APCC’s charge tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:22.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
