This represents a downward shift from the pollsters’ last survey, when the splits were 42/51. \nWhile we see the expected partisan divides (83/10 approval among Republicans and only 5/91 among Democrats), independent voters appear to be matching up exactly with the overall numbers. Also, both women (36/59) and men (41/50) rate Trump job performance as a net negative. \nOutside of his job approval and favorability ratings — Trump’s only seen favorably by 39% of respondents — Quinnipiac also asked American voters how they view the media as it relates to the president. \nOverall, 90& of those polled feel it is “very important” or “somewhat important” that the press “hold public officials accountable.” As for how the the media as a whole is covering Trump, 50% of voters disapprove of the coverage of Trump compared to 45% who feel it has been fine. \nOn the other hand, 61% dislike the way POTUS has talked about the press, with only 35% approving. Trump has taken to calling various mainstream media outlets “fake news” and recently claimed they were the “enemy of the American people.” \nAs for who is seen as more trustworthy by the American public, the media comes out on top. A majority (52%) feel they can trust the press more to tell “the truth about important issues” than Trump. Only 37% feel that way about the president. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:32:34.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
