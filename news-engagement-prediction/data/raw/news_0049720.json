Rowling's Dog Has The Most Adorable, Feminist Literary Name Source: Chris Jackson/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images By Kristian Wilson 2 hours ago \nSometimes it doesn't take much to turn a bad day into a heckin' wonderful one. Now that I know J.K. Rowling's dog is named for three famous woman writers , I feel a lot better about this world in general. \nRowling is currently hard at work on her next two books , one of which may be tied into the Harry Potter universe in some way. On Monday afternoon, the beloved writer retweeted a post from WeRateDogsâ˘, with the following comment: \"I've spent all day wrestling with the same damn paragraph, but this afternoon my dog was rated on @dog_rates and that's everything.\" \nThe original tweet from WeRateDogsâ˘ included two images of a heckin' adorable West Highland Terrier named â wait for it â BrontĂŤ . That's right, J.K. Rowling's lounging, sailing Westie is named for not one, not two, but three famous woman writers! \nThe daughters of an Irish clergyman, Charlotte, Emily, and Anne BrontĂŤ published their work in the 1840s under the names Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. The sisters first published a collected volume of poetry, titled Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell in 1845. Today, Charlotte is famous for writing Jane Eyre , but she is also the author of several lesser-known works: Shirley , Villette , and The Professor . Emily wrote Wuthering Heights , and Anne published Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall . I've spent all day wrestling with the same damn paragraph, but this afternoon my dog was rated on @dog_rates and that's everything đśâ­ď¸ https://t.co/OO0KeAtSGz ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:14:56.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
