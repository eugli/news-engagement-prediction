and we should not make easy assumptions about the length of time this would take, the process Scotland would have to follow or the terms of membership that may be on offer.”\nCommenting on the two academics’ analysis, he pointed out that the Nationalists would still be arguing in a second referendum for “an independent Scotland that would face an uncertain process applying to join the EU as a new member state.”\nA spokesman for Mike Russell, the SNP Brexit Minister, said: “Scotland faces being dragged out of Europe against its will by a Tory government with just one MP out of 59 in Scotland, but that MP – David Mundell – seems totally oblivious to the irony of him seeking to lay down the law on what should happen next.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:16:26.467+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
