He mentored nearly all the big-name chefs who are putting Indy on the national map today, including Milktooth’s Jonathan Brooks. \nOn Tuesday, Hardesty announced that he would close his acclaimed Recess on Feb. 18 and leave the restaurant industry. He will hand the Meridian-Kessler space over to another of his protégés, Pizzology owner Neal Brown, who plans a Japanese restaurant. \nRecess was revolutionary for Indianapolis when it opened in 2010 with daily changing prix-fixe menus that give Hardesty his own culinary playground, hence the restaurant’s name. \nDiners so smitten with Hardesty’s attention to ultra-fresh seafood, seasonal cooking, classic technique and disciplined creativity over the course of his career earned the chef nods from the New York Times and USA TODAY. He regularly was among James Beard Awards regional best chef semifinalists . \n“I go out with my head held high, and I know I did the best I could,\" Hardesty said. \"And along the way, I think I fed some people some pretty decent food. And that’s all I ever really wanted to do.” \nHardesty said gift certificate holders must use their vouchers on or before Feb. 18. Buy Photo \n(Photo: Liz Biro/The Star) \nAlthough many diners continue to deem Recess as Indy’s best restaurant and young chefs still want to clock time alongside Hardesty, he is ready to give up the business' strenuous physical and mental demands and the long hours that Hardesty said took him away from his wife and two daughters. \n“I’m not going to open any more restaurants. I’m done with that. I guess I should never say 'never,' but I really have no desire to engage in this activity ever again,” he said. \n“I want to do something where I’m creating something. I don’t know what that is yet.” \n[ Liz Biro covers food and dining: new restaurants, tasty events, best recipes. Please support local journalism and subscribe today. ] \nClosing the 4907 N. College Ave., restaurant has been on Hardesty's mind for a couple years. In 2015, he admitted that his passion was waning. Although he had garnered his fourth James Beard best chef Great Lakes award semifinalist nod that year, Recess suffered financially from the city’s competitive, ever-growing restaurant landscape. Media attention shifted from Recess to Fountain Square/ Fletcher Place restaurants and others. Circumstances convinced Hardesty in 2015 to add more typical al la carte service to Recess’ prix-fixe format and put a raw bar in the mix.
