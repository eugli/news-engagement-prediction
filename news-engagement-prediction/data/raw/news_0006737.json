In an announcement on Tuesday, Mr Hoeven said that the acting Secretary of the Army, Robert Speer, had ordered the corps to allow the work necessary to complete the pipeline.\nNative Americans and their supporters have set up a camp near the Missouri River But the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe argues that the Army has to wait for the results of a scheduled environmental impact study (EIS) that was ordered in January.\n\"The Army Corps lacks statutory authority to simply stop the EIS,\" they said in a statement.\nThe $3.7bn (Â£2.8bn) pipeline is designed to transport about 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day across four states, from North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois, where it can be shipped to refineries.\nThe Sioux say the final section would contaminate drinking water and damage sacred burial sites. They and their supporters have set up a Sacred Stone spiritual camp near the Missouri river.\nJust four days after taking office, President Trump signed an executive order in favour of the pipeline. He told the Army to quickly reconsider its decision to explore other routes.", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-38734450", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2328/production/_93900090_037483513.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-37863955", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/FCE8/production/_92244746_dakota_pipeline_map624.png", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/E678/production/_93900095_036744154.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-01T08:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T11:57:06.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
