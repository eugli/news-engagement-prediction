The regulator, however, said the new prices will be applicable for a period of one year, unless revised by another gazette notification. \n\nOver 90% of stents implanted in India are DES â€” metal stents coated with a drug that prevents the arteries from closing again. Till now, the price of DES in India had ranged anywhere from Rs 35,000 to Rs 1.95 lakh. \n\nBiodegradable stents, made of material that is said to dissolve and gradually get absorbed by the body, is considered among the latest stent technology and was priced at around Rs 1.80 lakh so far. \n\nData presented by the industry to NPPA shows hospitals and doctors earned a huge mark up on the manufacturers' or dealers' cost, sometimes to the extent of 650%.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T12:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:49:35.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
