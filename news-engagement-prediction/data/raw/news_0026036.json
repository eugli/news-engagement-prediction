That is the first of four televised matchups with the Twins, who also train in Fort Myers.\nThe lone televised matchup with the Yankees is Tuesday, March 21 (6:30). There aren’t many other American League East matchups on the schedule. They will play the Rays twice (Sunday, February 26, 1 p.m; Saturday, March 11, 1 p.m., on NESN-plus) and the Orioles once (Friday, March 10, 6 p.m.), on Red Sox Foundation night.\nTheir opponents on the broadcast schedule include the Pirates (three times), the Phillies (twice), and the Braves and Nationals (once).\nDave O’Brien will call the games, but Tom Caron will fill in when O’Brien has ESPN commitments. Jerry Remy and Steve Lyons will rotate as analysts. Dennis Eckersley is not traditionally a part of NESN’s spring coverage.\nNESN will begin its coverage from Fort Myers on February 11 across its various daily programming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T05:39:16.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
