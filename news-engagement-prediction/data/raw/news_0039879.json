The inimitable singer and social activist, in an interview with our correspondent, accused the politicians of ruining the future of Nigerian youths through their actions in governance. In what looked like a carryover from the #I StandWithNigeria protests, Charly Boy took a quick glance at the current state of the economy and declared that the youths were at a disadvantaged position as a result of several years of misrule by the political class. Blaming the youths for allowing this to happen through their complacence and inaction over the past years, he said, “Reality bites. I hope Nigerians can now see the disadvantage of waiting for my “turn to chop”. We are all guilty. The youths have been corrupted by their docility, inaction and fear. “The future of the youths has been stolen by very wicked, vile and insensitive politicians whose sole purpose of governance is to enrich themselves. If the youths can’t rise to the challenge, then it’s a shame. If we can’t pull ourselves together, millions of us will eat sand before the end of the year.” The singer, who is also known for his radical views on the nation and his penchant for controversy, announced that, in the absence of a meaningful initiative to help ‘bell’ the proverbial cat, he had decided to start a new movement with the hashtag, #OurMumuDonDo . Describing the movement and explaining why it should be embraced by all Nigerians, he added, “This is a movement of frustrated Nigerians determined to change the Nigerian state by fighting for the good of all. We have suffered. We are hungry and we have been looted, ravaged and bastardised by criminal politicians because they always take us for granted. “They use religion and ethnicity to divide us along our fault lines, while they loot us dry with audacious impunity. This is the time for the citizens to fight back. #OurMumuDonDo will flood the system with the coalition of this vexed, frustrated and angry Nigerians. We will flush out the politicians and criminals in government who will not take #NIGERIAFIRST as their new mantra. We are ready to die to ensure that government is responsive to all. Let me take the first bullet. Our Pain is enough and our anger must be channelled to change Nigeria for the good of all. #OurMumuDonDo. ” Reacting to President Muhammadu Buhari’s continued absence from the country, Charly Boy said that although Nigeria had been down this route before, the President’s absence might really be due to ill-health, after all. “I pray for him and I wish him well. However in my opinion, Buhari is not our problem. We have a fundamental problem, which we must address. It is our miracle mindset. “As for me and my followers, we are ready to defy the odds and challenge all constituted authorities in Nigeria, beginning from now. The battle line is drawn. We are ready to ensure that all Nigerians enjoy governance. We are willing to give up our lives for the good of our country and peace in the heart of poor Nigerians. I believe in Nigeria because I can see that it’s time for the exceptional youths of this country to come forward and fight to retrieve our stolen future.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T09:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:35:53.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
