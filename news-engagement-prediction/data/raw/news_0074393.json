Frazier had yet another big performance as Georgia took down LSU on Saturday. Slot to Georgia Links \nATHENS, Ga. -- Georgia (17-12) needed every one of J.J. Frazier's 29 points as it pulled its SEC record to .500 at 8-8 with an 82-80 win over LSU. The senior guard scored at least 28 points for the fourth time in his last five games and has the go-ahead free throws with 1.6 remaining to give the Bulldogs a much-needed win. \nHe also added eight assists and was joined by Juwan Parker and Derek Ogbeide as double-digit scorers. Parker had 12 points and a game-high eight rebounds. Ogbeide also had 12 points and had four boards. (Photo: UGA Athletics: John Kelley) Not a member?

That evaporated quickly, however, and LSU took a three-point lead with a 9-0 run and just under a minute left. \nGeorgia will look to make it three-straight against Auburn on Wednesday, March 1 at Stegeman Coliseum.
