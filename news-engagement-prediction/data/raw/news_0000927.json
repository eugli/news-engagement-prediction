Thousands join London protests against Donald Trump travel ban Thousands march to Downing Street in protest at Trump's travel ban \nThe executive order, which shut down the US refugee programme for 120 days and halted all immigration from Somalia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya and Yemen for 90 days, prompted thousands of Londoners to march on Downing Street on Monday evening. \nThe home secretary, Amber Rudd, issued one of the strongest condemnations of Mr Trump's immigration policy, saying it risked becoming a \"propaganda opportunity\" for the Islamic State, according to The Times. \nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan said Londoners would not support \"rolling out the red carpet\" for Mr Trump until the muslim ban is lifted. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan: 'Trump's ban is cruel and shameful\" \nMr Kahn told the Standard:\"We must now rescind the offer of a full state visit for President Trump - until this ban is lifted.\" More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T15:37:31.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
