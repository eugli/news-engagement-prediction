The first match will be played in Pune. Catch all live updates here. â€” BCCI (@BCCI) 23 February 2017 \nHours after one Australian team played out a T20 International in Adelaide, another Australian team will take on India in a Test match, 9044 kilometers away. ( Full preview ) \nIndia and Australia are set to face off in the first of four Test matches in Pune today and it will be a battle of attrition. While the hosts are undeafeted in their last 19 Tests, the visitors have just about found a combination that they are certain of lasting them for some time to come. \nHowever, Australia's plans seem to have been thrown out of the window with the pitch in Pune looking like it could take turn from Day 1. \nSteve Smith went on record to say he has not yet seen a pitch look like that before the start of a Test match. Virat Kohli feels the turn would be rather slow. How the surface plays out will become clear over the next couple of hours but it is unlikely to be easy for the Aussies, who were hammered in all four Tests on their last visit almost four years ago. \nSmith did concede that Australia are the underdogs in the series against the world's number one side. Australia will hope that their new boys live up to the promise they showed back home. \nKohli will obviosly expect his men to keep up the excellent work that has resulted eight wins out of nine Tests this home season. \nA RARE SIGHT \nThe world's top two Test teams, the two best batsmen in Test (Smith and Kohli) and the three best Test bowlers in the world (R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Josh Hazlewood) could feature in the Test. However, so heavily are conditions stacked in favour of spin that Australia might even drop Hazlewood instead of an extra spinner. \nRECENT CONTESTS \nIndia had whitewashed Australia in the four-Test series back in 2013 while Australia won 2-0 in 2014-15. \nRECENT CONQUESTS \nIndia have been on a high, having won three successive series at home vs New Zealand, England and Bangladesh. Australia lost a three-match series to South Africa before blanking Pakistan with a new-look team. \nVirat Kohli issues Mitchell Starc warning to India's batsmen in Pune \nAustralia paceman Mitchell Starc has raised his game to the next level and India's batsmen need to be wary of his ability to trouble them with reverse swing, home captain Virat Kohli said on the eve of the first Test beginning on Thursday. ( Read more ) \nFive reasons why Australia should be wary of Virat Kohli's Invincibles \nIndia and Australia square off in a four-Test series from February 23. What are the major challenges for the visitors against Kohli's Invincibles ? Is it just the spinners or the turning tracks? Or will it be the packed stands that could intimidate the Aussies? Then there's the question of tackling Virat Kohli.
