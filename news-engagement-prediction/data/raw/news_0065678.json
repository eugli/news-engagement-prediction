A Dominican Republic newspaper has mistaken the 58-year-old actor with U.S. President Donald Trump . \nAlec Baldwin has won two Emmy awards in his lifetime, but a newspaper called El Nacional has just identified the actor as U.S. President, whom the actor impersonates on Saturday Night Live despite Trump’s outrage. \nThe Dominican Republic newspaper may have just given Trump one more reason to bombard Alec Baldwin with criticism on Twitter. El Nacional accidentally identified the actor as the U.S. President when it published a picture of the actor referring to him in the caption as, “Donald Trump, president of the United States.” \nNewspaper publishes Alec Baldwin photo instead of President Trump https://t.co/7GnlkWDN9k pic.twitter.com/Yp1bMnBlkk \n— PureMadMentalRadio (@puremadmental16) February 25, 2017 \nLast Saturday, the newspaper apologized to its readers and “anyone who felt affected” for the gaffe. It seems that Alec Baldwin’s mother, Carol, was right when she once predicted her son would make it to the White House. \nNow there’s at least one newspaper that thinks Alec Baldwin is the U.S. President. While being confused for the U.S. President may not be a big deal for Baldwin, the latest SNL episode certainly is, according to Vanity Fair . \nAlec Baldwin, who hosted the NBC sketch show for a record 17th time, once again rolled out his spot-on Donald Trump impersonation and it really paid off this time. The actor, who has been impersonating Trump on SNL since October last year, helped the show set its five-year ratings record. \nSNL is currently enjoying a kind of renaissance thanks to Alec Baldwin’s iconic impersonation of Trump, as well as Melissa McCarthy’s impersonation of White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. \nAlec Baldwin Says What We're All Thinking About His Trump Impression https://t.co/IdUQTYsbxb pic.twitter.com/R5cdQrKDtZ \n— Paul Varcent (@PaulVarcent) February 24, 2017 \nDespite the fact that in the past few years SNL has lost a fair share of its viewership and fans who thought the sketch show became too boring and unfunny, the NBC show once again returned to the spotlight and enjoys millions of tweets and Facebook posts from fans discussing Alec Baldwin and McCarthy’s impersonations on the show. \nThough there is at least one person who thinks SNL is still unfunny. Alec Baldwin’s impersonation of Trump didn’t go unnoticed by the U.S. President himself, who last month took to Twitter to call SNL “not funny,”“really bad television” with a “terrible” cast. \n. @NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T12:17:03.635+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
