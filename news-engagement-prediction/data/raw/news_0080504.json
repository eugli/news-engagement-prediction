They pressed forward with intent sorely lacking of late and forced Simon Mignolet into two early saves from Robert Huth and Shinji Okazaki. Liverpool's first sight of goal came after 10 minutes when Sadio Mane had Leicester's defence scrambling with a brilliant ball across the box. But it was the hosts who continued to dominate, Vardy registering a rare shot on target 20 minutes into the opening half after brilliantly bringing down Kasper Schmeichel's long ball, per Squawka: Squawka Football @Squawka Jamie Vardy's 20th minute effort was his first shot on target in 533 minutes of Premier League action. Great chance. https://t.co/qPL7RGBQ7E 2/27/2017, 8:25:15 PM Eight minutes later, Vardy slid a fine finish past Mignolet and inside the near post to put Leicester ahead. It was a goal straight from the 2015-16 Leicester copybook, Vardy finishing faultlessly after being put through one-on-one with the goalkeeper by a brilliant Marc Albrighton through ball, per The Times ' Henry Winter: Henry Winter @henrywinter #lcfc unrecognisable. Now playing with all the pace and tempo of last season. Vardy storms through, clinical finish. 1-0. 2/27/2017, 8:29:08 PM Liverpool put their best move of the half together two minutes later to set up Coutinho for a close-range effort, but the Reds were largely abject in the opening 45 minutes. Six minutes from the break, Drinkwater doubled Leicester's lead as he fizzed a shot home from 25 yards after Liverpool could only half clear a corner. Per AFP's Tom Williams, the midfielder could hardly have struck the ball better: Tom Williams @tomwfootball Albrighton's cross headed away by Lallana and Drinkwater shows beautiful technique to zing a right-foot shot past Mignolet from 25 yards. 2/27/2017, 8:40:12 PM Liverpool took control of the possession early in the second half, but despite decent efforts from Coutinho and Mane, they could not cause Leicester any real trouble before the hour. And they continued to look very vulnerable to a Foxes break. It was one such moment that led to Vardy's second as he was put beyond Liverpool's defence by a long ball and crossed long to Riyad Mahrez on the left touchline. Neat work from the Algerian then opened up space for Christian Fuchs to deliver to Vardy and the Englishman headed home from between Lucas Leiva and Emre Can just after the hour. Julian Finney/Getty Images Liverpool's response was to finally string some decent football together, and Coutinho netted from 15 yards 21 minutes from time, side-footing home after excellent creative work from Can. A nervy spell ensued for Leicester as Liverpool pushed for another to set up a grandstand finish. But it was not to be, despite Coutinho continuing to look dangerous, and Drinkwater actually had the best chance of the closing stages as he blasted over the bar following fine work from Mahrez. Post-Match Reaction Shakespeare picked out a fast start as being key to Leicester earning their first league victory of the year, per the Foxes' Twitter feed: Leicester City @LCFC CS: \"Could see in the players' eyes they were up for the fight tonight, they had fire in their bellies. We set the tone early.\" #LeiLiv 2/27/2017, 10:14:55 PM Klopp rued Liverpool allowing the defending champions to play in the same style they did last season, per BBC Sport's Tom Rostance : \"We knew how Leicester would play, go back to their roots. We could have done much better. We let them be Leicester of last yearâ€”that's our fault. We should get criticised. This inconsistency makes absolutely no sense.\" Like the new article format? !", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:51:57.750+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
