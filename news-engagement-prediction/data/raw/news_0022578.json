Dramatic video captures break at Oroville Dam spillway as concrete chunks sent flying Midway down the Lake Oroville Dam spillway there appears to be trouble. Along with the water, chunks of concrete can be seen flying around the 18-second mark. State engineers were expected to conduct their first inspections Wednesday morning of the damaged spillway at Oroville Dam, about 24 hours after a 250-foot-long pothole was discovered in the massive structure, forcing a halt in water releases. From the air, views of flowing waters suggest Sacramento region's new abundance Titled \"Raindance,\" this drone-shot video provides images that begin at Lake Clementine Dam on the Middle Fork American River in the foothills east of the Sacramento Valley and brings viewers down to the confluence with the heavy-flowing Sacramento River at the capital's flooded Discovery Park to Tower Bridge and beyond. Watch five years of Sierra snow from space Entering February 2017, the Sierra snowpack is 177 percent of normal. That’s a big difference from a few years ago – the snowpack was 25 percent of normal in 2015. This series of satellite images shows the snow accumulation from space at roughly the same time of year for the past five years. Watch crews closing gates to Sacramento Weir, and beautiful views of waterway Officials have closed all the gates of the Sacramento Weir, stopping the flow of water that helped flood the Yolo Bypass west of Sacramento. After heavy rains, crews on Jan. 10, 2017, lifted gates on the flood release structure near downtown Sacramento. It was the first time since 2006 that the river rose high enough to open the structure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:22:30.233+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
