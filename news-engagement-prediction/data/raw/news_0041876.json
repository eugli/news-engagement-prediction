External Link: Lincoln in Photo tweet: My fan cam of today's goal @SeanRaggett @LincolnCity_FC #Impvasion #EmiratesFACup #LincolnCityFC @dancowley1 \nHaving already eliminated second-tier Championship teams Ipswich and Brighton on its remarkable run to the last 16, fifth-tier Lincoln ousted a top-flight club that held runaway Premier League leaders Chelsea to a draw just last weekend. \nEighty-one places separate Burnley and Lincoln in the English football pyramid but there was no obvious difference between the sides on a chilly day at Turf Moor. \n\"I'm lost for words, it's mad, I can't believe it,\" Raggett said. \n\"The fans were amazing, all through the game. They're a top quality side, drew with Chelsea last week, it's amazing.\" \nRaggett said his side always believed they could spring an upset. \n\"Belief? Massively, we didn't come to draw, we came to win the game,\" he said. \n\"Crazy, a non-league side in the quarter-finals in modern football, it's unheard of.\" \nThe last non-league team to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals was Queens Park Rangers in 1914. \nLincoln were playing in the last 16 for the first time in 130 years. Another non-league team, Sutton, hosts Arsenal in a fifth-round match on Tuesday (AEDT). \nPedro and Diego Costa were on target as Chelsea ended Wolves' Cup run at Molineux. \nThe runaway Premier League leaders restored some normality to proceedings as Wolves — conquerors of Stoke and Liverpool — were beaten 2-0. \nMillwall booked its place in the last eight when Shaun Cummings' last-minute strike compounded Premier League champions Leicester City's woes, who must now rely on an even-more-unlikely Champions League triumph to salvage anything from its hapless title defence. \nChampionship high-flyers Huddersfield frustrated Manchester City and had a first-half attempt disallowed before holding on for a scoreless draw at the John Smith's Stadium. City manager Pep Guardiola made eight changes to his side but recalled Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Claudio Bravo. \nHuddersfield was without Socceroos midfielder Aaron Mooy due to his being on loan from City. \nMiddlesbrough advanced despite letting a 2-0 lead slip in just one minute against League One side Oxford. Fabio scored the winner for Boro to break Oxford hearts with just four minutes remaining. \nAAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:57:44.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
