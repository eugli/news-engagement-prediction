Article continues below \nThere was enough time for Liverpool to stage a comeback when Philippe Coutinho scored in the second half but Leicester never looked like crumbling. \nVardy was as threatening as he was last season, Drinkwater produced a stunner and Wilfred Ndidi played the role of N’Golo Kante to perfection. Article continues below \nNo wonder Craig Shakespeare was delighted afterwards. \nLeicester’s caretaker manager admitted he could tell his players were determined after watching them warm up. \n\"I could see in their eyes that they were up to the fight in the warm up,\" Shakespeare said, via the Mirror . \"They have had to take criticism but we set the tone, they were excellent in the first 10-15 minutes. \n\"I wasn't sure what we were going to get. I told Jamie Vardy to be a nuisance and a threat.” We witnessed the Vardy of last season \nHe was a nuisance all right. He gave Lucas Leiva fits throughout the contest. Video: Vardy's first goal \nThe 30-year-old has now scored three goals in two games, having failed to score in 2017 before last week’s game against Sevilla. \nAnd one stat from his performance against Liverpool has left fans mightily confused. \nVardy recorded 71 sprints on Monday evening - his season high. \nAgain, there’s only one question to be asked: where was that all season? Twitter reacts to the stat \nVardy worked harder than he has ever done this season in Leicester’s first game since Ranieri’s exit. No wonder fans are calling him a snake on Twitter. Effort = success \nAfter the game, the England striker said he had no idea why the Foxes had been unable to produce anything close to the levels they reached last season. \n“I couldn’t put my finger on why we haven’t been doing that regularly,” Vardy said, via the Telegraph . \"We’ve been working hard and it’s just not been happening.\" \nIt’s obvious, Jamie, as the above stat proves. Put in the effort and the wins will soon follow. Did Jamie Vardy force Claudio Ranieri out of a job? Let us know in the comments section below! \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
