Kennington reached the pinnacle of his sport at Daytona International Speedway on Sunday. \nIn between, he entered 204 straight races in NASCAR’s Canadian series. He won 26 of them en route to two season championships. But whenever he retires as one of the greatest drivers this country has produced, the highlight of his years in stock cars will be a 16-car wreck — the circumstance that ended Kennington’s debut at the Daytona 500. \nKennington ran a clean race until the 127th of 200 laps, when he was caught in the tail end of the sudden, indiscriminate pileup and knocked out of contention. He nearly slipped to safety along the inside of the track, but the front right wheel of his Toyota Camry rammed into the skidding Jimmie Johnson, who had spun out in the middle of the speedway seconds before. \nHe wound up 36th of 40 drivers after the damage was accounted for, two spots behind Johnson. Three-time runner-up Kurt Busch surged from second place on the final lap to win his first Daytona 500; Ryan Blaney was second and A.J. Allmendinger third. Thanks to all who helped make this possible! Just couldn't clear the wreck did our best \n— DJ Kennington (@DJKRacing) February 26, 2017 \nPremature exit aside, Sunday’s action capped a breakthrough week for Kennington on NASCAR’s biggest stage. \nThe 39-year-old St. Thomas, Ont. driver arrived at Daytona several days ago without a guaranteed spot in the main field. He qualified for his first 500 on Thursday by the slimmest and most dramatic of margins: on a last-lap pass in a last-chance preliminary race, winning himself the last of 40 starting positions by four-hundredths of a second. \nIn doing so, he became Canada’s first driver at the 500 in 29 years, and achieved something no Canadian had ever done before: qualify for Daytona with only one prior start in NASCAR’s top-tier Cup Series. \nKennington wasn’t involved in the first of several significant wrecks on Sunday. Kyle Busch’s sudden spin-out on the 103rd lap sent himself and three other drivers to the garage, including Cup Series veterans Matt Kenseth and Dale Earnhardt Jr. The Canadian also avoided mistakes that befell other newcomers to the 500, like fellow “open” qualifier Corey LaJoie, who slid into a wall early in the race while trying to exit onto pit road. \nBefore 2017, Kennington might have expected to spend his remaining years in the car without a shot at Daytona or a race of comparable stature. In addition to his 19 full seasons in Canada’s top professional rung, he has raced a combined 55 times in NASCAR’s minor American divisions, the Xfinity Series and the Camping World Truck Series. \nHe debuted in the Cup Series three months ago at the Can-Am 500 in Phoenix, with the support of Alberta-based Northern Provincial Pipelines president Dwight Kennedy. From there, Kennington’s longtime sponsors, Castrol Canada and Lordco Auto Parts, and another team owner, engine manufacturer Marty Gaunt, joined forces to back his bid for Daytona, the first race of the new NASCAR season.

Kennington’s big break: Can a journeyman driver from small-town Ontario make history at the Daytona 500? \nThis spring, Kennington will return to the NASCAR Pinty’s Series for his 20th pro Canadian season. He placed sixth in the Pinty’s standings in 2016 and fifth the year before, ending a personal run of eight consecutive top-three finishes. \nThe 2017 campaign starts May 21 at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park in Bowmanville, Ont., followed by a June 3 stopover at Delaware Speedway, his home track.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:47:43.234+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
