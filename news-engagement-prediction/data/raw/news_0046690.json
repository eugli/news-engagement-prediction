Then, I just made a run for it.\" The coyote chased the doctor outside for about 10 feet until a squirrel distracted it and it ran off, Poletti said. \"It all happened very quickly,\" he said. \"I was just shocked because the office isn't in a rural or forest area, and there are a lot of homes and commercial properties nearby.\" Poletti noted, though, that coyotes are abundant on Sullivan Island in South Carolina -- the beach island town where he lives and which is about three miles from his office. \"We hear them howling on a nightly basis,\" he said. \"There are definitely a lot of coyote reports in the surrounding areas, but I don't think we've ever had a coyote enter a building like this before.\" ABC News Security cameras at the Southeastern Spine Institute in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, captured the moment a coyote followed a doctor into the building on Feb. 15, 2017. Poletti said he called the Mount Pleasant Police Department and reported the incident. The doctor said that initially, animal control officers from the police department told him he could hire a private trapper. However, a few days later, the police department offered to have its animal control officers set up a trap to try and capture the coyote, Poletti said. The Mount Pleasant Police Department did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment on the incident. Mount Pleasant Mayor Linda Page confirmed that the town generally refers residents to trappers when they report coyote sightings, according to local newspaper The Post and Courier . Page declined to provide further comment on the town's response to the incident until she could talk with her staff about it, the newspaper reported. She did say, however, that if \"there's any kind of danger to human life, we're going to take it seriously,\" The Post and Courier added. 0 Shares ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:29:56.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
