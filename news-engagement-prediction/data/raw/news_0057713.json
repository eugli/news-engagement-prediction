Other yawn-inducing careers include those in consulting and accounting, banking, engineering and sales. \nMarketing and communications, and IT completed the top 10 humdrum jobs. More than eight out of 10 legal workers admitted their work doesn’t get them excited. They put this down to the amount of time employees are bogged down in case research. \nThe least bored people surveyed were those working in education, executive management and research and development. \nThe survey, which quizzed 1300 professionals, also looked at which countries have the most bored employees. Those working in the United Arab Emirates are the most bored, with 83 per cent saying they find work uninspiring. The UK has the third least bored workers, with 64 per cent saying their work bores them. Switzerland comes in at the least boring, with only half employees saying they’re bored. \n“Boredom at work is a key issue for firms trying to keep millennials engaged, especially in traditional industries such as accounting and legal jobs which can be perceived as dull while employers attempt to give young employees the satisfaction of making an impact in their work life in order to prevent them from moving on too swiftly,” said Alice Leguay, co-founder and chief operating officer at Emolument. \n“Without an inspirational leadership figure, or an exciting professional challenge to motivate younger team members, boredom will quickly settle in.” \nMOST BORING JOBS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:05:45.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
