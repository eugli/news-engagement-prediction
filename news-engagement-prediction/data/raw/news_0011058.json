The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made... US Constitution, Article III (2) Getty \nBut the courts do not offer opinions on government policy unless they are asked - they only interpret law when a case is brought before them. \nThe other two branches of government make and enforce the laws, and the judicial branch interprets the laws when there is a dispute. \nThat is the issue here - a presidential executive order has all the force of law, and is subject to the same checks. Why doesn't Trump fire these judges? \nIt is true that district judges are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. \nJudge James Robart, for example - the \"so-called judge\" of Mr Trump's Twitter criticism - was appointed by President George W Bush and confirmed in 2004. \nBut Mr Trump can't fire judges. \nThat's because the founding fathers of the United States created a system to protect the judiciary from interference.

It is the same system used to remove a president. \nThis \"article three\" protection is, in practical terms, very rigid. Only eight judges have been convicted in an impeachment trial in the entire history of the United States. \nThe end result is that federal judges usually serve until they choose to retire - or until death. \nIn effect, two of the country's three branches of government are in conflict - and neither can remove the other. What about the Supreme Court? \nThe Supreme Court, as the name implies, has ultimate power in the judiciary - the other courts are inferior to it. \nIn this case, the government could have taken its appeal against the district rulings straight to the Supreme Court - and may still do so.
