Gaurang (Doshi, producer) and Anees had forbidden me from talking about it, even with dad.”\nThe actress is undeniably thrilled to be a part of the ensemble, which includes Amitabh Bachchan, Anil Kapoor, Arjun Rampal and Arshad Warsi. “This film will be a milestone [in my career] because it was my dream to do a 20-second appearance alongside Amit sir. Career high is so much better than chemical high,” she says.\n\nHow will the sequel, which reportedly kicks off in mid-March in South Africa, be different from the original? Esha says while the vein could be identical, the story is fresh. “This time, there are more layers, more secrets and it has me. My character is crucial to the plot and I am confident I can pull this off.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T07:06:54.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
