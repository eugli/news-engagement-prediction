Following a discussion with his aides that lasted a few minutes, she refused and returned to her car.\nLe Pen has tried to raise her international profile and press her pro-Christian stance with her visit to Lebanon, a former French protectorate.\nOn Monday, she met with President Michel Aoun and Prime Minister Saad Hariri . She said Syrian President Bashar Assad was \"the most reassuring solution for France,\" adding that the best way to protect minority Christians is to \"eradicate\" the Islamic State group preying on them â€” not turn them into refugees.\nSome Lebanese officials including, including Hariri, a Sunni, have taken umbrage at what is widely seen as her stigmatization of Muslims, who her followers claim are changing the Christian face of France. There also was apparent displeasure at her comments about Assad.\nChristian right-wing leader Samir Geagea said after meeting with Le Pen on Tuesday that \"terrorism has no religion.\" He described Assad as \"the biggest terrorist in Syria and the region.\"\nWalid Jumblatt, a leftist politician in Lebanon, tweeted on Tuesday that Le Pen's statements in Lebanon \"were an insult toward the Lebanese people and Syrian people.\"\nAfter walking away from the meeting with the grand mufti, Le Pen said she previously had told the cleric's office that she would not wear a headscarf.\n\"They didn't cancel the meeting, so I thought they would accept the fact that I wouldn't wear one,\" she said. \"They tried to impose it upon me.\"\nThe office of Lebanon's mufti issued a statement saying that Le Pen was told in advance through one of her aides that she would have to put on a headscarf during the meeting with the mufti.\n\"This is the protocol\" at the mufti's office, the statement said. It said that the mufti's aides tried to give her the headscarf and that Le Pen refused to take it.\n\"The mufti's office regrets this inappropriate behavior in such meetings,\" the statement said.\nLe Pen said she had met in the past with Egypt's Grand Sheikh of Azhar, the head of the Sunni world's most prestigious learning institute, without wearing a headscarf. Photos of Le Pen with Ahmed Tayeb in 2015 in Cairo show her with the cleric with her hair uncovered.\nLe Pen's refusal on Tuesday to don a headscarf would be in line with her strong support for French secularism and a proposal in her presidential platform. French law bans headscarves in the public service and for high school pupils.\nLe Pen's proposal aims to extend a 2004 law banning headscarves and other \"ostentatious\" religious symbols in classrooms to all public spaces. While the 2004 law covers all religions, it is aimed at Muslims.\nLater Tuesday, a small group of Lebanese protested in Beirut against Le Pen's visit. One protester raised a drawing of Le Pen between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump, with \"Neo-fascists\" emblazoned underneath.\nPrivacy Policy", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ac510e/turbine/la-90-seconds-4-stories-you-cant-miss-video-20170221", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ab65a3/turbine/la-me-not-my-president-rally-20170220", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/latimes-datadesk-template/fonts/0.3.1/belizio-narrow-semibold.woff", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58ab6bf6/turbine/la-me-whittier-police-shooting-vodeo-20170220", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/latimes-datadesk-template/fonts/0.3.1/belizio-narrow-semibold.eot", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58abdad3/turbine/la-me-whittier-police-shooting-20170220-video", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/latimes-datadesk-template/fonts/0.3.1/belizio-narrow-semibold.eot?#iefix", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-58aacb7f/turbine/la-ideas-exchange-event-bernie-sanders-our-revolution-working-class-world-excerpt-6-20170220", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/latimes-datadesk-template/fonts/0.3.1/belizio-narrow-semibold.ttf", "https://api.nlr.tronc.com/v3/newsletters/subscriptions&newsletterApiKey=t2RIwsHk5p8RFZ0sPKLEr2M0Rh64DNz69BDRyGQa&grecaptchaSiteKey=6LeLkgoUAAAAALGXqOHElPreIs6Z9DwMgVDgB13j&allurl=http://newsletters.latimes.com/"], "published": "2017-02-21T15:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:45:07.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
