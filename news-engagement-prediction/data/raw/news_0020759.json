He didn’t back down. \n“I’d rather not be in that position obviously, but at the end of the day when you need to speak for yourself and make it known how you feel, you don’t shy away from those opportunities,” he said. “(I was) making sure I needed to say, what I needed to say.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T23:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:54:54.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
