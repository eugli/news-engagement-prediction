Afterwards, I received five different bills from Etisalat for unknown numbers. I visited one of the service centres where I was told that eight mobile phones and SIM cards had been purchased in my name. I told the employee that I did not purchase those products. When I confronted the defendant, she claimed that it was her sister who did so. I asked her to cancel those numbers, and when she was late in doing so, I complained to the police,” the friend said.\nRecords showed the friend was later informed that the defendant purchased ten mobile phones and didn’t pay the bills.\nAn Emirati employee at Etisalat confirmed that the accused visited her at the service centre in Sharjah and filled in the application on behalf of the friend.\nThe primary ruling remains subject to appeal within 13 days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:42:08.640+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
