February 21, 2017 8:31 PM 1 / 6 Photo: Getty Images Turning 21 is a milestone no matter who you are. But Game of Thrones star—and birthday girl—Sophie Turner hit her big day in style. As one of the newest additions to Louis Vuitton’s roster of well-dressed actresses, Turner has spent the past few months turning heads in looks and custom pieces designed by Nicolas Ghesquière. Like past brand muses Charlotte Gainsbourg and Jennifer Connelly, Turner possesses a modelesque physique and the ability to take Ghesquière’s unconventional creations onto the red carpet with ease. At January’s SAG Awards she stunned in a slinky crimson gown with an asymmetrical neckline—a quick change from the lacy blue jumpsuit she wore the day before at Variety ’s awards season brunch. Saving her most daring number for last week’s BAFTA ceremony, Turner impressed in a black-and-silver gown with a thigh-high slit made of material that looked like the texture of liquid metal. Adding a bombshell touch to each futuristic ensemble with her flowing waves and dramatic beauty, Turner (and her stylist, Rebecca Corbin Murray) put a fresh spin on what we’ve come to expect from Louis Vuitton. Though she’s yet to be tapped for a campaign à la Selena Gomez or Jaden Smith, Turner has both the social media following—4.5 million and counting on Instagram—and the personal style to represent all that’s youthful and cool about the brand. Whether she’ll wind up on billboards remains to be seen. But her impeccable style and Game of Thrones ’ 2017 return means there will be plenty of great outfits in her future.
