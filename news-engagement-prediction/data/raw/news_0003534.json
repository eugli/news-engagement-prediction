(Leonor Vivanco/Chicago Tribune) Duo work to fight never-ending battle against homelessness (William Hageman, Tribune Newspapers) \nThe donation marked the first contribution students made to Deborah's Place though Buddy's Helpers, officials said. \nFor Deborah's Place, which serves about 325 women annually, the unexpected donation of socks and money will go a long way because any private gift and support will help the organization maintain services amid the state's funding woes, said Michelle Patterson, development director. \n\"The women we serve at Deborah's Place are in great need of everything and they come to us usually with nothing. So when we receive financial donations, that helps us provide them with the safe and stable housing they need in order to set goals and attain those goals,\" she said. \nThe event, designed to help teach students about the importance of giving back, coincided with the inaugural National Get Up Day, an initiative by U.S. Figure Skating to encourage perseverance in life. \nJazzmin Jordan, 16, said she wrote down the message \"Good things come to those who wait so be patient and be kind and things will start coming your way and it'll get better\" on a slip of paper, sharing a motto her mom told her and one she strongly believes. \n\"When something didn't go my way or something didn't happen and I was just eager for it to happen, I would panic and just freak out,\" said the junior at Lane Tech who lives in West Ridge. \"Passing this message on will help them realize that things don't have to come right away. You can work hard, you can just wait, you can just be who you are as a person and you'll get a good outcome in the end.\" \nTwitter @lvivanco", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:45:48.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
