Patients will be transferred to the unit next Tuesday. Officials say the unit will help people through Orillia and up to Muskoka.\nThe size of the unit has nearly doubled, and the hospital has added new equipment.\n“While our program has grown over the decades, the physical space we’ve had to work in has remained relatively the same. Thanks to community support, we now have a much more modern work space that will afford families the privacy they deserve and provide clinical staff with room to maneuver.”\nThe Orillia Soldiers’ Memorial Hospital Foundation will try to close the gap of $200,000 through fundraising over the new few months.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:11:06.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
