Robert M. Gill is getting reacquainted with his jail cell after he crashed into another vehicle when fleeing from police following an alleged drug deal in San Antonio on Thursday. The 68-year-old's original life sentence was pardoned by President Obama but now he could face up to 40 years in prison for possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine, according to Bexar County police. Robert M. Gill, 68, was arrested after he crashed into another vehicle when fleeing from police following an alleged drug deal in San Antonio, on Thursday. The convicted drug dealer had his original life sentence pardoned by Obama in 2015 Gill was jailed on charges of cocaine and heroin distribution conspiracy in 1990, until Obama commuted the 'nonviolent offender' in 2015, the San Antonio Express News reported. After his release Gill seemingly made an effort to stay away from a life of crime and he became a paralegal for local criminal defense law firm. But on Thursday he met an unidentified person in the parking lot of a grocery store to pick up a 'black backpack containing a kilo of cocaine worth $26,000', the affidavit said.
