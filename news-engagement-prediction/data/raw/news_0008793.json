Sector data shows his theoretical best lap, adding a quicker final sector from a later lap, would have a 2m03.936s. \nJust as impressive was his longtime sparring partner Mark Winterbottom, who put the No. 60 BMW M6 GT3 second fastest just 0.18 of a second down on the Ferrari. \nPRACTICE 1: Ingall fastest early at Bathurst 12 Hour \nThe BMW had earlier triggered the only red flag of the session, Steven Richards slowing on his way up the hill on the car’s out lap, returning to the session soon after its resumption. \nThe two Australian flag-liveried Jamec Pem Audi R8s were next in third and fourth. The No. 75 all-international car of ex-F1 racers Markus Winkelhock and Robin Frijns with Frank Stippler pipped the No. 74 that Garth Tander will share with Christopher Mies and Christopher Haase, Tander getting away with a quick spin in the early minutes. \n2015 winners Nissan were next up, Katsumasa Chiyo popping in a lap as the chequered flag waved to move the No. 23 GT-R up to fifth place. \nThe No. 7 BMW M6 that topped the opening session cruised to sixth in the all-in Practice 2, ex-F1 racer Timo Glock doing the honours, while Maro Engel put the No. 22 Mercedes-AMG GT3 he will share with Shane van Gisbergen and Craig Baird into eighth place. \nThere was one small drama as the session ended for the No. 90 MARC Cars BMW M6, the metallic green machine rolling to a stop at Skyline on its in-lap. \nThe reason? Out of fuel... Stopped in for a chat. #B12hr pic.twitter.com/WYCllodRKq — Tori Martin (@Tiri_Trouble) February 2, 2017 \nThe cars will next hit the track at 12:35pm AEDT for their third of four practice sessions on the opening day. \nRESULTS — Practice 2, Bathurst 12 Hour (60 Min) 1.
