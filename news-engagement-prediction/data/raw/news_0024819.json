It was widely assumed that up to 3,000 children might be helped when the Dubs amendment to the immigration act was passed. Why has the UK ended its 'Dubs' child refugee scheme? Read more \nReligious leaders are expected to join Lord Dubs in his petition presentation on Saturday after the archbishop of Canterbury warned that halting the initiative would see more children being trafficked, exploited and killed. \nDubs said on Friday that home secretary Amber Rudd was wrong to say local authorities did not have the space to take in more children. \n“All the government needs to do is put out a new appeal to local authorities asking who can take more children,” he said. “It doesn’t need a whole new consultation. We are going to keep the pressure up about this. I believe that the government decision to limit the number of children allowed in to 350 flies in the face of both parliamentary opinion and public opinion.” \nA number of Tory MPs have also vowed to fight the decision. On Saturday, a Conservative peer who was granted asylum in the UK after fleeing the Bosnian war urged the prime minister to live up to Britain’s history as a safe haven for refugees. \nArminka Helić, a former special adviser to the former foreign secretary William Hague, told The Times : “Britain has a long and proud history of giving refuge to the most vulnerable people. 'I was welcomed. Now I work for the NHS': views on Dubs from former child refugees Read more \n“I hope that our government will find a way to live up to that ideal, even amid current challenges.” \nHelić told how, aged 23, she fled the ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Bosnia 25 years ago with her mother and sisters. \nShe wrote to a family in Barnes, south-west London, where she had been an au pair, asking Jane, the mother, for books. \n“Inside she placed a ticket to England,” she said. “That is what I want to explain to people about this country, Britain is not [Nigel] Farage, it’s Jane – people who do amazing things.” \nHelić a close friend of Angelina Jolie and the pair co-run the Jolie Pitt Dalton Helić Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation dealing with refugees and violence against women. \nA high court challenge to the decision to close the Dubs scheme has been pencilled in for 2-4 May. The legal challenge, which is being brought by the charity Help Refugees , claims that the consultation process with local authorities that led to the cap on the scheme was “fundamentally flawed”.
