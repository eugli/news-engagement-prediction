Multiple GBs of storage space were slowly but surely becoming the norm for high-end phones, more connectivity options were being added, and, most important, touchscreens were about to become popular. Nevertheless, Nokia and Symbian were still leading the smartphone industry, as Apple's very first iPhone was just hitting the market, and Android was not yet ready for its commercial debut. After reviewing the greatest handsets of 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 , we're now inviting you to join us in remembering some of the nicest and most memorable smartphones that were introduced throughout 2007. In case you're wondering, the smartphones are listed in alphabetical order, not chronologically. If you have a favorite smartphone from a decade ago, feel free to let us know about it! Apple iPhone While it was announced by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007, the original iPhone didn't hit shelves until half a year later, on June 29. This was the first (and last) time when an iPhone did not become available shortly after its announcement. Under development for over two years, the iPhone was envisioned as a 3-in-1 product: a widescreen iPod, a mobile phone, and a \"breakthrough internet communications device.\" The handset became the world's first highly successful touch-only smartphone, as Apple sold more than 1 million units less than 3 months after launch. Like it or not, the iPhone seems to have represented a turning point in the history of mobile phones. The original iPhone was praised for its user-friendly 3.5-inch multi-touch display with 320 x 480 pixels, plus its interface and multimedia/internet capabilities, while being criticized for the lack of features that other high-end smartphones already had (like 3G connectivity and built-in GPS). The iPhone was available in the US exclusively on AT&, first in 4 GB and 8 GB variants, then in 8 GB and 16 GB flavors.
