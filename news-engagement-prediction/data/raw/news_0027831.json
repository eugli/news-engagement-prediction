Kids and their devices 74 per cent of children aged six to 13 use a tablet. 20 per cent of six to seven-year-olds use mobile phones; 2 per cent have their own phone. 74 per cent of 12 and 13-year-olds use mobile phones. Around 95 per cent of households with children have a computer. Source: Sean Ellis, Roy Morgan \nThe bulk of that age group owned their own smartphone. \n\"Not just with kids, but with adults too, they are still holding a device at the same time [as watching TV] and when there's a two-minute gap or a commercial break ... they flick straight to the other device,\" Mr Ellis told ABC Radio Sydney . \n\"These things are just what kids are accustomed to.\" \nThe findings are similar to those found by the Australian Institute of Family Studies , which reported last year that kids aged 12 to 13 spent at least three hours a day looking at screens. Kids expect on-demand TV \nMr Ellis said the generation of children surveyed had grown up with the \"expectation\" that their entertainment was on demand. \nThe number of organisations offering streaming services and catch-up television shows via the internet has increased in recent years.

(Flickr: Michael Cramer) \nTwo-thirds of kids watched videos via the internet in an average four-week period according to the survey, with YouTube being their favourite website. \n\"These kids grew up being able to push a button whenever they want it at any time,\" Mr Ellis said. \n\"The idea that TV is boring no matter what is on is just because TV is so static and it might have ads on it.\" \nABC Radio Sydney listeners have had similar experiences in their households: \n\"We're extending our house and have realised that only one room will have a TV because 'appointment TV' in our family is pretty much dead. We don't have Foxtel either. Breath of fresh air not having to plan rooms around TV connections.\" — Kathy Franco \n\"I was brought up in front of the box and learnt about all manner of things; my kids, older now, barely watched TV but surf.\" — Kim \n\"I've caught myself telling my eight-year-old to watch TV with his little brother as it's more sociable than the iPad. We are pretty strict with screens but it has struck me as ironic that I'm saying TV is the sociable activity.\" \n\"Haven't turned our TV on for many years. Adults and kids alike. As a family we occasionally watch the iPad online together over dinner, otherwise everyone's entertainment is online and personal.\" — Amanda Are parents worried? \nAccording to Mr Ellis, the parents of children \"are pretty tech savvy themselves\" both with online use and with their technology products. \n\"They're the ones who bought the tablets that the kids are now using. \n\"They're all on Facebook too, so it's not as though all the things kids are doing is completely foreign to parents.\" \nMr Ellis said parents also liked how they had better control online over what their kids watched by installing internet filters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T10:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:15:53.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
