Massive drop in German asylum seekers \nExit centres could also be set up near airports to hold rejected asylum seekers in the days or weeks before they are deported. \nThe federal government also plans to spend €90m (£76m) this year as part of repatriation and reintegration programs. More money will be given to voluntary returnees who make their decision quickly. \nSome 890,000 asylum seekers arrived in Germany in 2015. Mrs Merkel's decision to leave the borders open while other European states were closing theirs dented her popularity and led to the rise of anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany (AfD).
