On the 2017 Grammys red carpet , someone decided to take President Donald Trump's campaign slogan all the way to the next level and turn the message into, well, her entire look for the night. That's right: Someone wore a \"Make America Great Again\" dress on the red carpet. \nThe woman in the gown is none other than Joy Villa, who describes herself on her website as \"is an internationally touring singer , songwriter, actress and amazing performer who reaches her audience on a one to one basis.\" She also reaches her audience with her outlandish red carpet choices â simply put, this ain't Villa's first wild fashion rodeo. At the 2016 Grammys, she wore something just as eye-catching â but admittedly without the glaring political assertions. \nThis year, Villa hit the Grammys red carpet, seemingly with one goal in mind: To make people's heads turn, and to let everyone know exactly who the hell she voted for.
