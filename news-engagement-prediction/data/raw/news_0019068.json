Senators spoke all day Monday and into the evening, and worked to generate support from followers.\nThank you to the @SenateDems for holding the Senate floor and voting no against Betsy DeVos.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., cited rallies outside the capitol in which people opposed DeVos' nomination.\nWhile the GOP is pushing a vote on Betsy DeVos, the people are rallying outside.

Drucker • 02/09/17 12:17 AM That all-nighter led to fireworks , when Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was deemed to be violating a Senate rule prohibiting senators from impugning the motives or character of other sitting senators.\nThat floor fight led to more angry Democratic tweets, but still did nothing to change the outcome of the Sessions vote. He was confirmed 52-47 on Wednesday, but Schumer thanked Senate staff nonetheless for helping them to protest the vote.\nOur thanks to the Capitol Police, stenographers, clerks, doorkeepers, Officers of the Senate, Cloakroom staff & pages who worked all night.— Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) February 8, 2017 \nBut at the end of the Sessions vote, Senate Democrats appeared to give up the strategy of holding all-nighters, without any explanation. That decision was made even though another nominee they oppose, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., to be Trump's attorney general, is expected by early Friday.\nDemocrats didn't tweet out their plans this time around, and instead left it to Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, to note on the Senate floor that the Senate would adjourn Wednesday night for the first time all week, a sign that no one would be staying up late to speak.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner 'Nationalism' isn't new to conservatism Before President Trump, Sessions tried to move American conservatism in a more nationalist and populist direction.\nBy W.

[Ron] Wyden,\" Cornyn said.\nWyden spoke for several minutes against Price. But after his remarks, the Senate immediately adjourned with no further explanation from Wyden or other Democrats.\nTop Story Jeff Sessions confirmed as Trump's attorney general Democratic complaints that Sessions worked against minority interests were ultimately futile.\nBy Kelly Cohen • 02/08/17 7:20 PM Share  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T09:48:30.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
