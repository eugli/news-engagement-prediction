Eton College: the average boarding school charges over £30,000 a year in fees \nT his is a fifth of the average fees for an independent senior school, according to the Independent Schools Commission’s (ISC) annual survey of its 1,200 members. \nThis is not necessarily for lower income families, it is for anyone who says private education is far too expensive. a professor of education policy at Newcastle University, said: “This is not necessarily for lower income families, it is for anyone who says private education is far too expensive. \n“They often include Olympic size swimming pools, rugby pitches and so on - we are saying that these are not necessary for private education. \n“We are saying, let’s get rid of all those and have the basics: high academic standards, strong grounding in mathematics, phonics and languages. It will be no frills and no flash.” Some private schools build Olympic sized swimming pools Credit: Phil Surbey \nH e plans to open the school at a newly refurbished church in the centre of Durham. The school will have Christian ethos, but will not be faith-based. \nProf Tooley, who has spent the last decade setting up chains of low cost private schools in countries such as India, Pakistan and Nigeria, added: \"There is always a desire among parents for private education, even those in very poor countries who cannot afford the fees. \n“I have given talks at conferences about this, and I am always asked 'could the same thing happen in the UK?' \"I have been thinking about it for several years and then finally got together with some colleagues and decided to do it.\" \nProf Tooley is setting up the school along with a Chris Gray, the former principal of Grindon Hall Christian School in Sunderland, who will be the headmaster. \nThey are currently in the registration process with the Department for Education, and hopes the school will be open by September. This is not necessarily for lower income families, it is for anyone who says private education is far too expensive Professor James Tooley \nI f successful, they plan to open a chain across the north of England. The school’s website states any premises will be “simple and unpretentious”, but “clean, hygienic and welcoming”. \nThe curriculum will be “traditional and knowledge-rich, giving children access to the best of what has been written, spoken and said”. \nThere will be an inclusive admissions policy, with the school taking children of all backgrounds, with no selection tests. Professor James Tooley \nT he average fees for an independent secondary school is £13,566 per year for day pupils, rising to over £30,651 per year for boarding schools. \nIt costs the tax payer £6,000 per year to educate each pupil at a state school. Julie Robinson, general secretary at the ISC, said that fees of £2,700 per year are the lowest she had ever heard of any school being able to offer. \nShe said: “It will be incredibly impressive if they can run a school efficiently on that. If it does pull it off it will be quite something, it undercuts the state by half. \n\"Some schools are very impressive in arts and sports, but some want an academically selective education and no frills schools suit some parents.” Follow The Telegraph", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T23:07:11.332+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
