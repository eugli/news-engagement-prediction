Photo by Cristina M. Fletes, cfletes@post-dispatch.com \nUpdated at 9:30 p.m. with identity of victim. \nST. LOUIS • A teenager was fatally shot Monday night near North Kingshighway and Terry Avenue in the city's sixth shooting of the day. \nA 17-year-old boy was shot in the head about 6:15 p.m. in the 5000 block of Terry Avenue, police said. He was taken to a hospital where he died shortly after the shooting. \nThe boy was found on the sidewalk by a relative who lives on the block and who called police, Lt. Stephen Chelie said. \nHomicide detectives were called to investigate. Police had taped off a block of Terry Avenue and a stairway leading up to a home on the block. \n\"We're exploring all leads,\" Chelie said. \nPolice did not identify the victim but Doug Hollis, a local pastor, identified him as John Frost. Hollis said he coached the teenager in a recreational basketball league in St. Louis for the last four years. \nFrost was shot outside his aunt's house, where he stayed the night after returning from four months in Texas, Hollis said. Frost, whose parents are both serving prison terms, had left St. Louis to live with his grandfather, he said. \n\"He left to make a better life for himself,\" said Hollis, who came to the shooting scene. \"He came back for less than 24 hours and this is what happens.\" \nFrost was a respectful teenager who loved to play guard in basketball and attend church every Sunday with his grandmother, Hollis said. \n\"He was an all-around great kid,\" he said. \"He was polite and respectful. And he was always willing to lend a helping hand.\" \nFrost had called friends to let them know he was back in town earlier Monday, Hollis said. His aunt was on her way to run errands when she found him shot on the sidewalk. She hadn't heard any gunshots, he said. \nA woman who was at the scene said a relative of hers saw a man in a car shoot the teenager before driving away. \n\"She looked right into the shooter's eyes,\" she said of the relative. \nThe incident was the sixth shooting but the only fatal one Monday, according to police reports. One of the other victims was in critical condition after he was shot about 5:16 p.m. near Natural Bridge Avenue and North Grand Boulevard. \nIn the 5600 block of Terry, a man shot and critically injured a woman who was beating him with a broomstick earlier this month.
