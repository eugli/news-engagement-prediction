The sprawling estate recently came on the market for $30 million. \nLocated in a verdant valley on 5,000 acres in County Wicklow, Luggala Lodge was built in 1787. According to the listing , it has \"that special brand of eighteenth-century gothick that rejoices in little battlements, crochets, trefoil and quatrefoil windows and ogee mantelpieces.\" In other words, it's a hunting lodge designed like a castle in miniature. \nThough by no means is it a tiny house. The main house contains three \"substantial\" reception rooms, seven bedrooms and four baths. There are four bedrooms in the guest house, and another 16 in seven additional cottages scattered about the property. \nIt also has one of the few remaining landscaped 18th century gardens: \"Luggala is a place of primeval colours: the greys, greens and browns of the landscape, the darkness of the lake, the whiteness of the beach, the yellow of the primrose and the gorse, the contrast of the bluebells and the purple of the heather,\" which is actual copy from the listing, and not, as you might surmise, prose written by one of the Romantics. \nIn 1937, Ernest Guinness bought Luggala and gave it as a wedding present to his daughter, Oonagh Guinness, when she married Lord Oranmore and Browne. \"Oonagh 'imbued Luggala with enchantment' and made it 'the most decorative honeypot in Ireland,'\" says the estate's website . Enchanting it was—Luggala has hosted Dublin's intelligentsia and seen quite a few celebrity visitors over the years, including Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson. Bono called the place \"U2's inspiration.\" \nBefore being listed for sale, the estate was available to rent for €22,000 per week (or $23,330). No word on whether the $30 million price tag comes with chauffeur service of a 1952 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith limousine like it did as a rental.
