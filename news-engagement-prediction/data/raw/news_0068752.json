She wasn't part of the research. \nWhile scientists in the past have identified key areas of biodiversity, the new work is more detailed. Researchers found the liveliest ocean hot spot also happens to be where the science of evolution sprouted: the Pacific Ocean off the central South American coast. It includes the area around the Galapagos Islands and goes back to \"our good friend (Charles) Darwin. When he went there, he got amazed,\" Chiaradia said.

Four of the six hot spots are in the Pacific; all are either in the southern hemisphere or just north of the equator. \n\"What makes this biodiversity? It's the isolation,\" Chiardia said. \"On land, we have kangaroos and weird animals like the platypus. And in the ocean it's not different.\" \nThe ocean is home to Australian sea dragons, a fish related to the seahorse that resemble mythical dragons and sometimes even have yellow and purple markings on their bodies. \nThese hot spots also tend to be places where the ocean waters churn more, Chiardia said. \nPenguins, which are near the top of the food chain, are a good example of the impact of changing water temperatures and currents. Warm El Nino waters have decimated Galapagos penguins and the population of southern African penguins has dropped by about 90 percent in just 20 years, Chiardia said.
