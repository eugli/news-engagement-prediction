(Maryse Zeidler/CBC) Related Stories Only 1 suspect in deadly Quebec mosque shooting, police say \nCrowds have gathered in downtown Vancouver to honour those killed in the recent Quebec mosque shooting and speak out against Islamophobia. \nThe Muslim Association of Canada is first having a prayer and gathering of people of all faiths outside the Vancouver Art Gallery at 6 p.m PT. \nOrganizers are starting the vigil with a few words from the Koran pic.twitter.com/oxmAVSDZHO \nThey will then march to Jack Poole Plaza and continue the vigil there. \n\"We Muslims, we're pretty tired of the stereotypes,\" said Tarek Ramadan, one of the organizers with the association. \n\"We're getting sick and tired of being stereotyped and blamed for things that we're totally innocent of, being labelled as radicals or Islamic terrorists.\" 'Time to stop Islamophobia' \nRamadan said the Muslim community began to plan the event shortly after a shooting at a mosque in Quebec City that left six people dead. \n\"It's just time to do something about it because it has gone to a really escalated level of danger when people get shot and killed in ... the mosque or get attacked in the SkyTrains or women get bullied in the schools. \n\"It's time to stop Islamophobia,\" he said. \nMP @DonDavies now at the mic at vigil against #Islamophobia \"Canada is not a place that will tolerate such a senseless act of barbarism\" pic.twitter.com/xizQf43vwM \nRamadan encourages those with queries or concerns about Islam to ask questions and be informed. \n\"Have no fear of the Muslim community. There's nothing wrong with being a Muslim,\" he said. \n\"And absolutely nothing wrong with Islam at all. It does not teach hate or violence or terrorism.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T09:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T04:57:04.119+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
