The company’s latest and greatest Android smartphone technically comes in 32GB and 64GB variants, but the latter model will only be sold in Asian countries like South Korea, India, Hong Kong, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) region which includes the majority of former Soviet Republics. Likewise, the 32-bit HiFi Quad digital-to-analogue-convertor (DAC) has so far only been confirmed as a feature of the LG G6 variants that will be sold in South Korea. Apart from Korea, this functionality is said to be available in a number of other Asian markets, but no details on the matter have yet been provided by LG. Finally, the support for the Qi and Power Matters Alliance (PMA) wireless charging standards will be a feature of the LG G6 that’s exclusive to the United States. \nWhile there’s still no official explanation of the fact that the 32-bit HiFi Quad DAC and 64GB of storage space will be restricted to certain regions, LG did clarify on its decision to make wireless charging an exclusive feature of the U.S. variant of the LG G6. While speaking at Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona earlier today, representatives of the Seoul-based tech giant said that wireless charging is in much higher demand in the U.S. compared to the rest of the world. The comment implies that offering this feature on a global level wouldn’t make business sense since it would increase the manufacturing costs of the LG G6 due to a feature that the majority of the world apparently doesn’t care about. \nRegion exclusives aside, all variants of the LG G6 will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 system-on-chip (SoC) and 4GB of RAM, in addition to boasting a 5.7-inch QHD display with an aspect ratio of 18:9. Likewise, all LG G6 models will ship with a dual camera setup consisting of two 13-megapixel rear cameras and a 5-megapixel front shooter. LG’s latest flagship will ship with a 3,300mAh battery and is slated to be released this spring. More details on the device are expected to follow soon.
