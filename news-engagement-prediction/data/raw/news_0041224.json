The streaming giant renewed Love for a third season ahead of the premiere of its sophomore season, which bows March 10. \nLove , an anti-romantic comedy set in Los Angeles, follows nice-guy Gus and sex-addict Mickey (played by Gillian Jacobs) as they navigate the highs and lows of intimacy and other things they were hoping to avoid. After a finale that ended with a gas-station kiss, the second season will see the pair facing commitment, and all that comes with it, as they attempt to bring order to their chaotic lives. \nRust co-created the series with Apatow and Lesley Arfin. \nWitaske, who hails from Second City, has also appeared on Netflix's With Bob and David , HBO's The Comeback , and Fox's New Gir l. He will next be seen on the big screen in Unicorn Store , directed by Brie Larson, and Lady Bird, directed by Greta Gerwig. \nHe is repped by Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment. \nLesley Goldberg contributed to this story.
