Heather Trott was a character !! … and people ask me why I don't watch stuff like Jeremy Kyle !! Sad world we live in folks .. \n— Cheryl Fergison (@cherylfergison1) February 23, 2017 You know I think I've had enough of the way people judge others .. I will say this one more time thank God we are not all built the same way \n— Cheryl Fergison (@cherylfergison1) February 23, 2017 I just don't get it .. when is the world gonna understand that no two people are the same ! We are all different and no one is perfect .. \n— Cheryl Fergison (@cherylfergison1) February 23, 2017 I think something has to happen soon we cannot keep ripping each other apart we have to start caring and find the respect again #community \n— Cheryl Fergison (@cherylfergison1) February 23, 2017 Negativity makes me sad it makes me upset makes people have no self worth .why is it so wrong to do right these days .no real encouragement \n— Cheryl Fergison (@cherylfergison1) February 23, 2017 That's why there is so much to do / see / learn / experience in life for the good so programmes like Jeremy Kyle are just depressing IMO \n— Cheryl Fergison (@cherylfergison1) February 23, 2017 \nWell said, Cheryl! \nThe actress won waves of support from her followers for standing up to the nastiness and speaking out about what makes social media such a vicious place. \nOf course, many people who commented may not have realised the hurt that it may have caused or may have forgotten that the actress behind heather would see the tweets and be affected by it but Cheryl’s message is clear and one we can all agree on – think before we comment on social media. \nThe star won huge popularity in her role as amiable Heather, who was brutally killed off by Ben Mitchell in shocking scenes. She has since returned to the show late last year in voice only when Dot Branning found an old taped conversation between Hev and her mate Shirley Carter. \nCheryl recently suggested online that EastEnders could do a DeadEnders spin-off involving a selection of deceased characters – we’d certainly tune in!
