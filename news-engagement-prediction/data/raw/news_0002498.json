I’m delighted with the outcome. I’m a winner. Justice has prevailed. The truth always wins. Simple as that.’\nDavid Walsh (left) is seen celebrating outside court after a judge ordered his stepmother Mary Walsh (right) to pay him £484,000 out of a £2.9million Lotto win\nThe verdict raises the possibility that other signatories of the winning ticket, who were paid varying amounts by Mrs Walsh, could demand a full one-sixth share like Mr Walsh.\nAsked about his late father Peter Walsh, he said: ‘He’s sitting up now in heaven looking down, cap in his hands, he took care of me.’\nSitting on the opposite side of the courtroom to her painter and decorator stepson, Mrs Walsh, wearing a black evening dress with a pearl necklace and grey cardigan, went pale and shook her head as the ruling was given.\nOutside the Four Courts, she told the Irish Daily Mail she was disappointed with the outcome and vowed to appeal.\nAn ecstatic Mr Walsh told reporters he just wanted to ‘get on with my life’, adding: ‘I’m out of here’, before making a quick departure.\nThe mother-of-two won the jackpot six years ago with a ticket that was signed by six family members including herself – yet she believed that she could do as she pleased with the money.\nShe gave gifts of as little as £86,000 to one signatory – a nephew of her husband.\nThe court heard the biggest gift she gave was £392,000 to one of her sons – even though an equal one-sixth share of the £2.9million prize money came to £485,738.\nLast night, at the highly charged conclusion of a seven-day hearing, Judge Richard Humphreys rejected Mrs Walsh’s version of events and awarded Mr Walsh £484,000.\nThe judge said Mrs Walsh was a woman ‘capable of very significant calculation and design.’\nThe judge gave the ruling despite pleas from Mrs Walsh’s counsel, Michael Delaney, that Mr Walsh cannot 'receive an entirely undeserved windfall in excess of £430,000’.\nHOW THE £2.9M WIN WAS UNFAIRLY SPLIT BETWEEN RELATIVES Last night's ruling could lead to other family members claiming a larger share of Mary Walsh's winnings.\nThe court heard how Mrs Walsh, along with her late husband and four relatives, signed the back of the ticket in a bit to avoid paying any gift tax.\nAfter winning a £2.9million prize, Mrs Walsh gave her sons Tony and Jason pay-offs of £380,000 and £257,000 respectively.\nMeanwhile, her late husband's nephew Kevin Black received just £86,000.\nLegal experts said the judgment ‘would certainly increase their chances’ of them seeking a larger share, having all been handed much less the a sixth of the winnings, which works out at about £480,000.\nThe ruling also sets a guideline for future Lottery winners – indicating that winnings should be distributed equally in cases where more than one person has signed the ticket.\nThe judge said Mrs Walsh gave unreliable testimony from the witness box this week and that she ‘ducked and weaved’ in her attempts to defend herself.\nThe ruling raises the prospect that other family members could now come forward to claim their own shares. Last night, legal experts said the judgment ‘would certainly increase their chances’ of them seeking a larger share.\nThe ruling also sets a guideline for future Lottery winners – indicating that winnings should be distributed equally in cases where more than one person has signed the ticket.\nUnder National Lottery rules, anyone who signs the back of a winning ticket is entitled to benefit.\nHowever, former Lotto claims manager Eamonn Hughes told the court this week that exactly how winnings are distributed ‘was none of our concern’.\nIn court, Mrs Walsh, of Perssepark, Ballinasloe, Co. Galway, insisted that she had given her stepson the choice of a £171,953 cash gift or her £116,068 house – and that Mr Walsh opted for the house.\nDuring the seven-day hearing, she said: 'Because they [Mr Walsh and his father Peter] had been estranged from the year before, and there had been no contact, and he came back three weeks before I won the Lotto, I felt he didn't deserve it.'\nShe said that despite her 'reservations', she had given her 'beautiful' home to the 52-year-old, and he 'wouldn't have got the house only for the Lotto win'.\nThe court has also heard that stepson David Walsh was seen as 'not much of a worker' and that he was once divorced after getting married in the US.\nMrs Walsh told Judge Richard Humphreys: 'We were afraid that some of his wives could come along and make a claim against him.'\nThe 65-year-old businesswoman claimed, on day five of the remarkable case, that painter and decorator Mr Walsh 'never once asked for any share in the Lotto'.\nMr Walsh, of Knocknagreena, Ballinasloe, always insisted that his late father – who died in December 2011 – had intended him to have the house, regardless of the Lotto win.\nBut Mrs Walsh had counter-sued her stepson, claiming that if he won the case for a share of the jackpot, then she should get her old house back because it would amount to ‘unjust enrichment’ otherwise.\nGiving his ruling after deliberating for about 30 minutes, Judge Humphreys said it was ‘not inherently plausible’ that Mr Walsh accepted a house worth £116,068 instead of £171,953 cash.\nThe judge observed that there was ‘no reason the plaintiff [Mr Walsh] would do himself out of £55,884’.\nLast night, at the highly charged conclusion of a seven-day hearing at Ireland's Four Courts, Judge Richard Humphreys awarded Mr Walsh £484,000\nThe ruling means that Mr Walsh will keep the house and get his £484,000 share of the jackpot.\nEarlier, during legal arguments, lawyers for Mrs Walsh said she never intended anyone who signed the ticket or the Lotto declaration form to receive ‘a portion of the prize as of right’.\nInstead, she intended ‘that such persons would receive payment of such amount of money as she in her discretion saw fit to make to them,’ the court heard.\nDervla Browne SC, for Mr Walsh, told the court that all six people who signed the ticket, including David Walsh, were entitled to benefit equally from the £2.9million.\nLater, Judge Humphreys ruled that Mrs Walsh had ‘made a conscious and deliberate decision to swear an affidavit she knew was false’ and had done so in order to ‘conceal her assets from persons including the plaintiff [Mr Walsh]’.\nThe temporary freezing injunction on Mrs Walsh’s assets – designed to protect the award of £484,000 in her stepson’s favour – will last until Monday, when the case will come before the court again.\nShe has 28 days to lodge an appeal. Outside the court, she agreed she was disappointed by the ruling. Asked if she will appeal, she said: ‘Yes.’\nTHE MILLIONAIRE CURSE? HOW £148M JACKPOT SPLIT FAMILY Euromillions winner Gillian Bayford, who won a £148million jackpot in 2012\nEuromillions winner Gillian Bayford revealed last year how landing a £148m jackpot in 2012 had made her life a misery and triggered a irreconcilable rift with her family.\nThe 43-year-old - who split from her husband Adrian fifteen months after scooping the prize - said she has not spoken to her 'greedy' family for nearly one year, despite giving them £20m after the windfall.\nShe claims her mother, father and brother - who all live in plush houses and drive flash cars thanks to her fortune - 'disowned' her last May, but still expect her to bail them out when they need money.\nShe also accused them of becoming 'downright nasty' by constantly 'flashing the cash' which she gave them after the win.\nMrs Bayford claims her brother Colin, 41, drives numerous Audis with personalised numberplates and that her father Ian, 71, has become so accustomed to the wealthy lifestyle that he refuses to fly economy class on airplanes.\nShe also said that her father tried to take control of the money she won and has repeatedly tried to claim a stake in her business.\nAdrian and Gillian Bayford from Haverhill, Suffolk, shortly after winning the £148million jackpot", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T12:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:04:34.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
