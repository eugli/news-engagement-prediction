The Dallas Business Journal has learned the hotelier plans to place its new 4-star concept, called Scion, within walking distance to Dallas' city hall. 8 photos The new Scion Dallas hotel — the latest concept from Trump Hotels —will bring a total… more Trump Hotels' new Scion Dallas hotel — a six-story, 220-room hotel with ground-floor retail space — will sit within a new $50 million mixed-use development near city hall, said Turkish developer Mike Sarimsakci . \"The Trump Organization wanted a 4-star business hotel in Dallas,\" Sarimsakci, founder and president of Alterra International, told the Dallas Business Journal in an exclusive interview. \"We shared our ideas with them and from those brainstorming sessions, this new brand came up. \"They wanted to create a hotel that would attract young business travelers in the creative and technology sectors with a collaborative concept in the lobby,\" he added. Unlike the ultra-luxury brand of the Trump Hotels namesake, the Scion brand won't bear the Trump name and will be relatively affordable with hotel rooms ranging from $200 to $300 a night versus a nightly rate of $700 and up. Last week, Trump Hotels CEO Eric Danziger , a former Dallasite, told the Wall Street Journal he would bring the newly announced Scion brand enforce to the U.S. market, with 17 deals in the works , including one in Dallas. For nearly a year, Trump Hotels executives have been shopping for 4-star and 5-star hotel sites in Dallas. A spokeswoman for Trump Hotels was not immediately available to comment on the Dallas hotel project. Finding a prime site Alterra International, which is based in Dallas and Istanbul, plans to develop the new Scion Dallas hotel as part of a mixed-use development fronting St. Paul Street between Wood and Young streets in downtown Dallas. The two parcels of land, which total nearly one-acre, are under contract by the development firm. An affiliate of Dallas-based Hamilton Properties Corp. — Hamilton St Paul Grp LLC — has a contract to sell the land to Sarimsakci in a deal expected to close by this summer. Dallas developer Larry Hamilton , who has worked on a number of projects in the city's urban core, confirmed the land deal, adding it was a \"prime site,\" for a new hotel or residential project. \"We wanted to put an affordable housing project on the site to permanently support that housing need, but we didn't score high enough for tax credits and we had some neighborhood opposition,\" said Hamilton, who is the founder and CEO of Hamilton Properties Corp. \"There's a lot of development potential south of Wood Street and this is a prime site,\" Hamilton said. Terms of the upcoming land deal were undisclosed. The two parcels were last valued at nearly $1 million, according to the Dallas Central Appraisal District. Dallas-based 5G Studio Collaborative has begun working on architectural renderings for the Scion Dallas hotel. Alterra International   general contracting work within the firm's construction division. If all goes well, Sarimsakci's team says the development firm expects construction to begin on the ground-up development by the end of the year. The new Scion Dallas — which could be the first location of the new concept — could open in early 2019. The first of its kind in the United States When Sarimsakci and Trump Hotels initially began discussions to develop a new hotel, the developer wanted to construct a Scion hotel in St. Louis. But opposition to Trump's election killed the deal before it really got started. \"It was right around the election, but there was opposition,\" Sarimsakci said. \"The Dallas Scion hotel is becoming a more important project. I feel like I owe them a hotel — that's the kind of relationship we have with these guys. \"They really want to do one in Dallas and then do one in Detroit,\" he added. \"The Dallas hotel will be the inspiration for the Detroit hotel because Dallas will probably be the first Scion hotel in the United States.\" The Scion Dallas hotel will feature much of the city throughout the building with modern, clean lines and lots of warmth, said Nile Tuzun, creative director of design and branding for Alterra International. \"People staying there will know they are in Dallas, each room will have its own environment and references to Dallas,\" said Tuzun, who added the new brand will attract \"young professional\" travelers. The ground-floor retail space, which will total about 20,000 square feet, will help bring in a Turkish furniture retailer, a steakhouse, a seafood restaurant, a Mediterranean restaurant and a Turkish coffee shop with pastries. The lobby of the Scion Dallas also will have a grab-and-go market for hotel guests and downtown visitors. \"The lobby will be part of a small market with a coffee shop experience,\" Tuzun said. \"We've seen a really cool concept in Barcelona with a nice market and bakery; it was packed. We think it would do really well.\" International financing; no city money With the entire project expected to cost roughly $50 million, Sarimsakci said the Dallas mixed-use development will have an international capital stack financing the project. One thing the project won't rely on: City money. \"We are doing it with no assistance from the city; it's all market funded,\" he said. \"It will have a real interesting capital structure. We have some friends coming in and partnering with us with truly international equity.\" Sarimsacki has international investors from Turkey, Katari (a municipality in southeastern Nepal) and Kazakhstan (a central Asian country and former Soviet republic between China and Russia) bringing money to the table to start the new project. \"We've been talking to them for a long time and now they have seen what we have done with the Butler Brothers Building and, now, they are ready,\" he said. Alterra International has been wrapping up the redevelopment of the historic Butler Brothers Building, which neighbors Dallas City Hall, with plans to build onto the larger city center district. With development wrapping up, Sarimsacki said this will be his next big project in Dallas. And that might be all until the next real estate cycle begins, said the San Francisco resident. \"We want Dallas to be London, we want Dallas to be Singapore and having these venues that we are creating will bring and keep the young people in Dallas,\" he said.
