(Photo: Nicole Hernandez/The Republic) \n234 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Rallies against Planned Parenthood are being held across the country this weekend, including five in Arizona, some of which were drawing counterprotests in support of the organization.\nAnti-abortion activists began organizing the nationwide Rally to Defund Planned Parenthood for Feb. 11 shortly after the Women's March on Washington and its sister marches across the country and around the world on Jan. 21. Anti-abortion activists said they were denied a role in the Women's March after organizers took a stance in support of abortion rights.\nThe weekend rallies are intended to encourage Congress to defund Planned Parenthood, according to protestpp.com , which states that rallies were planned outside more than 200 Planned Parenthood clinics in 45 states .\nTempe rally: Peaceful, separated About 200 opponents and supporters lined the corner of Dorsey Lane and Apache Boulevard outside Planned Parenthood's Tempe Health Center on Saturday morning, remaining peaceful and sticking to separate sides of the street. The crowd was pretty evenly split between protesters and counterprotesters.\nA group of anti-abortion activists repeated prayers while holding \"Defend Life\" and \"Choose Life\" signs. Planned Parenthood supporters formed a sea of pink on the corner closest to the clinic.\nProtesters against Planned Parenthood rally outside the Tempe clinic on Feb. 11, 2017.

We are based on prayer. We respond to them (the other protesters) by praying for and blessing them,\" she said. \"We listen to them and we stay in peaceful prayer.\"\nAmber Squires, one of the organizers of the pro-Planned Parenthood group, said she also is here every weekend but was happy to see the much larger attendance this Saturday.\nAs the morning progressed, some people switched sides of the street, mingling with and talking to those on the other side of the issue. Some counterprotesters wore bright pink vests labeling them as “escorts” to help any patients leave the clinic.\n\"The fact that people here are talking about both sides in a very peaceful manner in public is amazing,\" said Planned Parenthood of Arizona spokeswoman Tayler Tucker. \"Today is a great example of how we can express our First Amendment rights respectfully and peacefully.\"\nMesa rally: All anti-Planned Parenthood About 150 people supporting the 40 Days for Life and Arizona Bikers for Life organizations rallied outside the Mesa Planned Parenthood clinic in opposition to Planned Parenthood.\n#defundpp rally in #Mesa.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T04:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T00:35:26.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
