The nursing workforce is in crisis and if fewer nurses graduate in 2020 it will exacerbate what is already an unsustainable situation,” said Janet Davies, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing. \n“The outlook is bleak: fewer EU nurses are coming to work in the UK following the Brexit vote, and by 2020 nearly half the workforce will be eligible for retirement. With 24,000 nursing vacancies in the UK, the government needs to take immediate action to encourage more applicants by reinstating student funding and investing in student education. The future of nursing , and the NHS, is in jeopardy.” EU applications for UK university places down 7%, MPs told Read more \nUniversities dismissed talk of a crisis, arguing that undergraduate numbers across other courses fell in 2012 when tuition fees rose to £9,000 a year but later recovered. \n“Our members report receiving a high number of good quality applications for most courses and they will continue to recruit through to the summer,” said Prof Jessica Corner, chair of the Council of Deans of Health . \n“Where courses have historically had a large number of applicants, fewer applicants might well not affect eventual student numbers.” \nProf Steve West, the chair of Universities UK’s health education policy network, said most universities had anticipated “a dip” in applications but called for the government to promote nursing degrees. \nThe drop in nursing applications was part of an overall fall in applications to start undergraduates courses in Britain this year, according to figures from Ucas, the university admissions clearing house. \nThe number of domestic applicants dropped by 5%, the biggest fall in recent years, and there was a 7% fall in applications from the EU, as reported by the Guardian last week . \nApplications from British-based 18-year-olds in their last year of school remained flat but there were steep falls in applications from people in their 20s. Combined with the lower level of EU applications since Brexit, it means 30,000 fewer applications overall, down from nearly 600,000 by the January application point last year. \nThe EU numbers were especially troubling after four years of 5%-7% growth in applications. \nApplications from Ireland were down by 18%, although Mark Corver, Ucas’s director of analysis, cautioned that individual countries showed wide swings, with applications from Portugal up by 15%. \nLast week Michael Arthur, the provost of University College London, said the national fall in applications was unevenly distributed. “The respective numbers for UCL are quite different. We are up in UK by 5%, we are down in EU by just 0.8%, and we are up in overseas by 6.9%. So you begin to see the large variations that there will be across the country,” Arthur told MPs. \nUCL’s experience has been replicated across institutions that demand higher A-level results for entry, including members of the Russell Group of research-intensive universities.

I am sure some will reduce in size and scale while others may increase their share.” \nNick Hillman, head of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said application numbers would improve when the current decline in the numbers of 18-year-olds in the population was reversed over the next decade. \n“The woefully low entry rates among some groups, such as poor white working class males, also suggest there is plenty of room for improvement,” Hillman said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:09:17.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
