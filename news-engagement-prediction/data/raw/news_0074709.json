Traders at the event have cited uncertain supplies, particularly of sugar, palm oil, and grains from emerging economies, as the cause behind the increase in price.\nPalm oil is currently at a 30-month high on supply limits in Southeast Asia.\nProducers in Abu Dhabi are currently being squeezed by January 2017’s utilies rate hike, increasing operating costs.\nRunning until March 2, the 1,000,000 square foot exhibition is expected to receive around 90,000 food professionals from 150 countries. \n“Buyer demand for healthy and halal products, as well as trusted resource provenance, has turned Gulfood 2017 into a window to global food sector reinvention. The show is already underlining its international reputation as a hotbed for unique business opportunities,” said Trixie LohMirmand, Senior Vice President, Exhibitions & Events Management, DWTC.\nHealth and wellness, alongside free-from products, including wheat-free, gluten-free, and dairy-free, feature prominently at this year’s Gulfood. Oganic foods are set to hit $1.5 billion in sales by 2018, driven by demand from key supermarkets, according to a Frost and Sullivan report.\nThe exhibition also plays host to the world’s largest annual Halal food sourcing trade show. A key issue on this year’s agenda is the standardisation of Halal certifications. The Emirates Authority for Standardisation and Metrology is driving a push for the unification of Halal accreditation and harmonised Halal standards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T13:07:55.378+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
