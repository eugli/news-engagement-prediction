Families are spending more than a third of their net income on childcare Credit: PA \n\"At a time when many families are facing a cost of living crisis, it is important the Government rethinks its involvement in childcare. Rowing back on unnecessary regulation and focusing public funds on those who need it, rather than subsidising the well-off, would be a good way to start.\" \nA Department for Education spokesman added: \"Helping families with high quality, affordable childcare is at the heart of this Government's agenda - that's why we are investing a record £6 billion per year by 2020. \n\"Our 30 hours free offer for three and four-year-olds is set to save working parents up to £5,000 per year and we're also supporting the most disadvantaged families through our free 15 hours offer for two-year-olds and our pupil premium - worth over £300 a year per eligible child. We make no apologies for regulations which keep children safe and well.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T10:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T05:47:44.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
