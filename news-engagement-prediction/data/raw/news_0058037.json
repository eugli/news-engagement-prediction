(Photo: AFP) Mumbai: The world’s heaviest woman Eman Ahmed has lost 50 kilograms in the last 12 days. The woman who landed in Mumbai on Feb 11 has been undergoing a weight reduction program after she was reported to have weighed 500 kilograms in December last year.\nThe 36-year-old Egyptian lady was transported in a custom made aircraft by Egypt Air. The woman hadn’t moved out of her house for the last 25 years before she was admitted to Saifee Hospital under the care of Dr. Muffazal Lakdawala and his team of doctors. The woman from Alexandria is currently undergoing treatment for sleep apnea, hypothyroid, diabetes, hypertension, kidney problems, fluid retention and mainly obesity.\nThe Egyptian will have a first surgery in the next two weeks and the doctors need her to reduce enough weight so that she can enter the operation theatre. Eman is almost 151 cm wide but can now lift herself up with some help which was impossible before. The doctors say she is improving by “leaps and bounds”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T09:36:41.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
