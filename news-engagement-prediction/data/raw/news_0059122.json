(Supplied: Flinders Memorial Statue) \nAlmost exactly 215 years since that day, a statue of Flinders and his cat Trim has today been unveiled at the now-thriving city of Port Lincoln in tribute to Flinders' famed antipodean voyage on HMS Investigator. \nThe two-metre-high work will be on permanent display at Port Lincoln's Flinders Precinct, near Flinders Archway on Tasman Terrace, and was unveiled by South Australian Governor Hieu Van Le. \nThe statue is one of only three castings of a design by British sculptor Mark Richards, who attended the ceremony. \nRichards said the statue depicted Flinders kneeling and using his compass to chart his voyage along the South Australian coast. \n\"I've made him working,\" Richards said. \n\"His map of Australia is on the base and he's measuring a part of the coastline.\" 'Accessible design' \nRichards said, despite Flinders' importance in Australian history, he remained relatively unknown in his homeland. \n\"I tried to imagine what it would be like if I walked up to a statue of someone who was largely unknown, and what I would want to pique my curiosity,\" he said. \n\"I came up with a design which was quite close to the viewer in the sense that it's quite low. It's very accessible.\" Photo: A mould of a boot for one of the Matthew Flinders' statues.
