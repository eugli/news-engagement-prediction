'Ken does not like brunette girls! I wanted to spend the rest of our lives together morphing into the Ken and Barbie dolls we love, but Anastasia was no longer committed to that dream. Anastasia spent £129,700 to look like a Barbie but after dying her hair (right) Quentin felt as though she was no longer committed to their relationship Quentin says that he is not short of offers when it comes to women - or as he refers to them 'bimbos' 'She made that clear when she changed her blonde hair. I'm a single and independent Ken now although it would be nice to find love again.' Quentin and Anastasia fell in love at first sight when they met in 2013. Sharing an obsession for the Ken and Barbie dolls from an early age, the pair had multiple cosmetic procedures to emulate the dolls. Most of the pricey treatments and operations were funded by their parents. Quentin (pictured aged 16 before surgery) continues to fork out £600 per month on fillers and injections and spending £500 on a second pinnaplasty Doctors have expressed concerns for Quentin's health after his multiple rhinoplasty procedures had left him with respiratory problems. Pictured after surgical procedures The procedures included two boob jobs, four nose jobs, lip injections, butt implants, cheek fillers, ear reshaping surgery, botox, eye bag removal surgery, fake tanning, teeth whitening, nail extensions and veneers. But despite their recent split Quentin says that he is not short of offers when it comes to women - or as he refers to them 'bimbos'. He continues: 'I meet bimbos from time to time who show interest in me and I'll take photos with them, but I soon become suspicious of their intentions. Despite health concerns Quentin says he believes it is necessary to 'suffer in order to beautiful' Quentin, who is now a TV personality in France and works as a presenter on W9 'Most of these girls just want the fame and popularity that comes with being with the 'French Ken.'' Quentin has continued to undergo surgery to look like Ken despite suffering health problems. As well as forking out £600 per month on fillers and injections and spending £500 on a second pinnaplasty (ear pinning surgery), Quentin has also spent a whopping £11,000 on four nose jobs to get a tiny Ken-esque nose. When he was still with Anastasia the couple bought matching Ken and Barbie style cars to emulate their plastic idols Quentin says that most of the women who approach him are only after fame After Quentin was involved in a car accident last year, it came to the attention of his doctors that his multiple rhinoplasty procedures had left him with respiratory problems as his nose is now too small to breathe through. Quentin, who is now a TV personality in France and works as a presenter on W9, says: 'I think my nose is the perfect - it's 100 per cent Ken. 'Having the complete Ken aesthetic is priceless for me and I've always believed it's necessary to suffer to be beautiful. 'But my nose has become too tiny after all my nose jobs and I do have quite serious respiratory problems now. 'My doctors were very concerned and they have advised that I redo my nose so I don't suffer more in the future. 'But that won't stop me from having other surgeries - I love being Ken.'
