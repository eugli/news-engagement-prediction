Unterman, however, said she is ready to battle, noting that Gov. Nathan Deal over the past few years has also backed broader coverage.\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution will again have Georgia’s largest team covering the Legislature. Get complete daily coverage during the legislative session at myAJC.com/georgialegislature. Deal last month unveiled a record $25 billion state budget proposal for fiscal 2018 that included a plan to put $20.8 million toward autism services for children on Medicaid . In 2014, he also added autism coverage for employees’ children on the state health plan.\nThe Senate push comes two years after the chamber won a compromise with passage of the state’s original mandate requiring private insurers to cover autism services for children up to the age of 6. Advocates are scheduled later this month to hold their annual “Autism Day” to lobby at the state Capitol.", "external_links": ["https://players.brightcove.net/1345087319/default_default/index.min.js?videoId=5281499915001", "http://legislativenavigator.myajc.com/#members/53", "https://players.brightcove.net/", "http://www.myajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/deal-seeks-raises-for-georgia-teachers-state-police-caseworkers/C8SlDWsLRjYcENWmCSVRaM/"], "published": "2017-02-03T18:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T08:59:43.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
