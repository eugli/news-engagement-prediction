And also, perhaps, their head coach Jim Boeheim closer to retirement. \nIt had long been understood that the 72-year-old Boeheim would step down following the 2017-2018 season and hand the program reins over to assistant coach Mike Hopkins. However, the Hall of Fame coach told “The Dan Patrick Show” on Thursday that timeline may have changed. “I don’t know what’s etched in stone these days,” Boeheim said. “I really don’t. There’s a plan in place, and we’re going to see what happens. But basically right now, I might be done this year. You just don’t know. You just have to wait until the season’s over.” \nThe coach officially made the announcement that he was leaving in 2018 all the way back in 2015 and hasn’t stepped down from that stance since. \nIn fact, most assumed that Boeheim was more likely to stay past 2018 then retire before it. This week, Sports Illustrated reported that Boeheim might try to stick around beyond next season. The Syracuse coach quickly shot down that rumor in a way that only he could . \nAnd then came Thursday’s remark. One assumes Boeheim is probably talking from emotion here. But this still is a situation worth monitoring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:10:53.509+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
