Tammy Pittwood \nKatey Pittwood has found embroidery to be more popular than expected. \n\"It certainly wasn't cool in the 90s. \nREAD MORE: \n\"I used to sneak out during my masters to get a little stitching in.\" Tammy Pittwood \nA second embroidery workshop will be held at Vintage Industries Ltd, but already has a wait list. \nBut last week's workshop at Vintage Industries Ltd showed Pittwood that stitching has become a bit of a trendy pastime, with attendees aged 25 to 55. \n\"We had loud music, smoothies and cakes. It was really fun,\" she said. \n\"A regular told one of the staff members that it was so good to see young people stitching.\" Tammy Pittwood \nKatey Pittwood attributes the popularity of stitching to trendy, modern designs. \nWith such positive feedback, Pittwood posted a second workshop to be held on March 4. \n\"We're already booked with 30 people and eight on the waitlist. \n\"I'm bringing embroidery back.\" \nShe attributed \"cool\" designs as a major drawcard in attracting young stitchers. \n\"They're contemporary and cool. They're swear words, tattoos and skulls. They're not fuddy-duddy.\" \nPittwood is also setting up a creative space for embroidery at her home - the former location of Eagars Funeral Services. \nFox + Plum Creative Hub, named after children Inky-Lou Plum, 4, and Fable-Bea Fox, 1, will open in April in the front portion of Pittwood's house. \nIt will be part public art studio, part retail shop and part family home. \n\"It's going to be a creative hub with tables, chairs and quirky retail,\" Pittwood said. \n\"And it will be more craft than paint, with wine, nibbles and talks.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T11:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:15:21.787+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
