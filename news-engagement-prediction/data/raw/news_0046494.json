I’m very black and white and I wear my heart on my sleeve.” \nFor a woman at the top of her game, Ward is surprisingly modest - believing problems are there to be solved. \nThe wealthy mother-of-four prides herself on hard work and remaining a strong family unit. \n“I had a quite a modest upbringing and came from a working background,” she tells me over coffee in her beautiful Cheshire home. \n“Both my parents had their own businesses and worked very hard. My mum owns a luxury boarding kennels while my dad has a fencing business. Dawn with husband Ashley \n“They are named after me and one of my daughters. We are very family orientated like that.” \nBorn in Salford , only child Ward attended school in Bolton after a family move, aged nine. \nHowever, the academic path wasn’t for her. \n“School didn’t really suit me,” she admits shyly. “I left aged 15, with no qualifications, which I’m not proud of. \n“We as parents are complete opposites with our children, we push them with their education because I think it is very important.” \nThe ‘we’ she refers to is husband of 22 years and ‘rock’ Ashley, a retired professional footballer. \nWith four daughters and shared business interests, Ward gushes: “We do everything together. Dawn Ward \n“We work together, we go out together and eat together and any challenges that we face - it’s always easier when you’ve got your husband by your side.” \nThe pair met in Bolton at The Tavern Fayre pub, on Hunger Hill, after Ward had returned from her London life as a model. \nHaving left for the capital aged 16, and lived in a shared flat with seven others, she landed work appearing in a Special K advert and Roy Orbison TV commercial. \nRemembering her formative years, she said: “At first, it was good living with the others but it got very hectic and in the end I moved to Stretham to get a bar job.” Read More Real Housewives of Cheshire star Dawn Ward launches beauty clinic in grounds of her palatial home \nHowever, after a return to Bolton she crossed paths with her future husband - an apprentice footballer who was playing for Leicester City at the time. \n“We got married and had children so my work was put on the back burner really for a number of years.” \nGearing back up once her eldest two children were out of nappies, she was determined to follow the family route of owning a business. \n“I decided that I wanted to work. I wanted to have a business and do something with myself. Dawn Ward \n“Bizarrely, I had a friend who was in to nursing homes - residential care homes - so I got hold of a business magazine and started flicking through it. \n“Poor Ashley didn’t have a clue. He was out playing football for Blackburn Rovers and I was sat at the kitchen table looking for a business to buy.” \nThey settled on a Bolton home named Abafields which they bought for £590,000, partly with Ashley’s money and help from the bank. \nAnd Ward threw herself in head first. Read More Is this REALLY the worst hotel in Manchester? We check in to find out \n“I would work there six days a week. \n“I’d drop my kids off in the morning and then learn how to run a nursing home - from bathing patients to first aid courses and how the business operated. I picked it up in six months. \n“Ashley would be a bit upset because he would come home from training and I would have five old dears around the table, but it was a good investment. \n“When we bought it, it was running at 80% occupancy and had 22 bedrooms. We sold it in 2002 for £1.2m having extended it to 36 bedrooms.” \nSpeaking of his wife’s natural ability to look after people Ashley added: “It’s in her comfort zone and she’s a real natural. \n“I couldn’t get used to it because I would go to these homes and time would stand still for me. I would walk in there thinking ‘crikey’, but Dawn would breeze in and say this is so and so.” \nFascinated by architecture and interior design, property had always been on the cards for the couple. \nAnd after opening a designer boutique in Wilmslow, they decided to make it a full-time venture, starting Bilton Ward Developments with former business partner Robert Bilton. Building bespoke top-of-the-range Cheshire homes, the company enjoyed a multi-million pound turnover - although Ward remains tight-lipped about exact figures. \n“Me and Ashley would often get in the car and drive around looking at people’s houses and we would make it into a day out, getting some inspiration.” \nExplaining the concept, Ward added: “I sort of thought I wanted to make residential houses but I want it to be like a pair of Armani jeans - a really high end brand so when you put the sign up for our business people would know what they were going to get.” Dawn Ward \nHaving eyed up Cheshire while Ashley played football, the couple decided to test the market. \n“We always wanted to move to Cheshire but we went and looked at house prices and we could never afford it. Then we found a derelict barn in Mobberley and we purchased it for £270,000. Everyone was saying at the time we had paid way too much.” \nTogether with Dawn’s father, the couple did it up - transforming it into a luxury family home. \n“We employed brickies. I was pregnant with Taylor at the time and actually even now it is probably still the fastest on time project we have ever done.” \nHaving spent £250,000 on interiors, including curtains and sofas, the reality TV star sold it for £1m. \nThe next house cost £1.6m and sold for £4.5m. A pattern was emerging. \n“I quickly thought, ‘wow, I like this kind of business’. \n“We got into property development and it was fantastic - we went on to build Wayne Rooney’s house and lots of other well-known people.” \nFrom there the business re-focused on pure interiors as they launched Arista Design. Dawn Ward decided to open Skulpt, a private non-surgical clinic, at the end of 2016 \nSpeaking of her latest ventures, Ward reels off 90 apartments in the south of France and a current £250m project in Mayfair - one of the most sought after areas in real estate. Not to mention doing the interior for Ralph and Russo in Harrods. \n“I always wanted it to be wow and everything we do is bespoke,” she says with pride. \n“I absolutely love my work and have done commissions for some of the most influential people out there.” \nHowever, the matriarch admits it’s not been all plain sailing, as the recession had a huge impact on her business. \n“In 2007, we hit a really hard time, it was horrific”, she says candidly. \n“The economy crashed all over the world and property was affected more than anything. \n“It is still difficult today and we’ve had to restructure things. Those days of the banks lending have gone and we do a lot of private commissions now.” \nThat’s not to say lessons haven’t been learnt. It seems the difficult times have had a wistful impact on Ward. \n“It makes you a much better business person to go through the bad times. When things are good and the money’s rolling in you can be very complacent. \n“I’ve learnt not to have all my eggs in one basket now. While we have the interiors business and the clinic, I still have other interests and am looking at bringing out a consumer range of candles and bath salts. Dawn Ward \n“On the other hand, I also learnt never to take on too much. You’re better off doing one thing very well than lots of things OK.” \nDespite difficulties, the business interests seem to be back on track as the couple run two companies out of Warford Hall, near Alderley Edge. \nThe converted call centre doubles up as an office for 30 staff who work across the brands, as well as a family home to Darby, 21, Taylor, 18, Charlie, nine, and Aston, aged seven. \n“Everything is about the team behind you”, she says. \n“I am lucky because I have a fantastic team and everyone cares.” \nSo how does she juggle business commitments with family life? \n“Family comes first,” is the firm response. \"My husband goes mad because all my businesses are inside the house, so I have my office on one side and the clinic on the other. But I’m able then to be a good mum, spend time with my children, and still work. It is about juggling.” \nAsked if she finds this stressful and that Salford determination shines through. Inside Skulpt \n“No, it’s just life and I love it. You have to work so the problem is there to be solved. \n“It’s about being organised and managing those situations where schedules might overlap.” \nAdding another feather to her cap, Ward decided to open Skulpt, a private non-surgical clinic, at the end of 2016. \n“It is medical, it’s clinical - not a beauticians,” she says seriously. \nDawn has assembled a team of doctors and nurse prescribers to work at the site, after scouring the world for the best in their field of aesthetic procedures. \nThe entrepreneur now specialises in a raft of anti-ageing and fat-blasting procedures at the clinic, based on-site. \nFrom skin tightening to non-surgical facelifts, acne treatment, scar removal, permanent hair removal, eyebrow tattooing and more. Dawn Ward with her Skulpt team \n“I’m always looking for different opportunities and the non-aesthetics clinic that I have now is just amazing. \n“Again, I wanted to give it the same high-end branding as my interiors business. I want it to be the best clinic with the best staff and the best equipment. \n“People will know that if you go to Skulpt you’re going to be taken care of and get the best results.” \nThis seems to be going down well with the clients, who include a celebrity following of reality TV stars. Read More Oliver Bonas launches its biggest store outside London in Manchester \nAsked why she decided to branch out in this direction she says: “It’s something that has always interested me and I have had lots of procedures myself. \n“I am very much into my makeup, my hair and the way I look. It’s just a natural progression from that and with the modern technology that is now available, I just love it.” Inside Dawn Ward's Skulpt clinic at Warford Hall \nAnd although the glamorous businesswoman will not divulge how much she has invested in the technology, with up to 32 patients a day and treatments costing between £80 and £1,200, it looks set to be a success. \nWith a growing trend for women to alter their appearance, I ask if it can get a bit addictive? \nLevel-headed Ward answers: “If someone comes in and wants a procedure that doesn’t look correct, then we won’t be doing it. \n“I wouldn’t let anyone walk out of the clinic with something done unless we think it’s right for them.” \nSo, with so much going on, not to mention her blossoming TV career, how does Ward remain balanced? \n“Never a day goes by, regardless of the stresses we’ve had and continue to have in every day business, that I don’t feel fortunate and grateful for what I have,” she says. \n“People tell me I work really hard for it, but my housekeepers work hard and haven’t got the same things.” Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T16:48:15.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
