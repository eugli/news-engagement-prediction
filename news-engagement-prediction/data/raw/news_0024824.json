The party-going population in this great city wants something different. \nGranted, everyone wants to have a good time, but in 2017 the definition of what that “good time” is has certainly changed from what it once was. \nThus, many New Yorkers have been wondering \"what's next?\" when it comes to nightlife, and as more and more people seem to be straying away from the standard \"club\" model, audiences are looking for something immersive. \nThat’s where relative newcomers like Brooklyn's House of Yes come into play. \nOpened for business on New Years Eve 2015, House of Yes (further referenced here as HoY) was designed as a \"place accessible to everyone,\" where people could \"act out and be their wildest selves.\" \nLocated in Bushwick right off the Jefferson Street \"L\" train stop, HoY exists in an easy-to-access area in a space without an abundance of neighbors or commercial properties. Founded by native New Yorker and musician/artist Justin Ahiyon, performance artists Anya Saopzhnikova, Kae Burke and Ilan Telmont, HoY was built to inspire. \n\"I loved hospitality right from the start and dreamed of combining those work ethic and customer service aspects with my love of the arts and performing,\" said Ahiyon. \nAfter years of playing in bands and managing a family restaurant in the East Village, Ahiyon linked up with his current partners and House of Yes was born. \n\"The four of us shared so many common goals and interests about the future of New York nightlife, especially about fusing large-scale immersive art and theater with the nightclub experience,\" Ahiyon said. \nWhat does that mean, exactly? Ahiyon said you'll have to go to HoY and see for yourself. \n\"We let our audiences dance on stage and on the upper decks. We let them in the shadow box and in the cages around the club. We encourage them to dress extravagantly, dress loud, dress in costumes and paint their faces — embrace their true nature and act accordingly,” he said. \n\"Many times you can't tell who is a performer or who is a customer. Those lines are totally blurred; all of us together make each night special and something to remember. That old saying about how ‘it takes a village to raise a child’ always comes to mind for me here. At House of Yes, we realized it takes 1000 people who feel truly uninhibited and inspired to make real magic happen in night-life.\" \nAs for any particular nights to partake in, Ahiyon recommends the \"House of Love, Kingdom of Yes, Treetops and new Casino Royale party,\" although he says that he can't choose a favorite party as \"everytime I think I had my favorite night here, it's blown out of the water the next weekend.\" \nLocated at 2 Wyckoff Ave. in Bushwick, Brooklyn, The House of Yes is open Tuesday through Sunday with weeknight programming that includes immersive cinema nights, pole dancing nights, variety shows, theater, live music and more. \nWeekends start early with brunch in the dining room (they have a full kitchen and a cafe that serves a mean falafel), rotating art events starting at 7p.m. and then a themed dance party at 10. \nWhen asked to compare HoY to other clubs in the city, Ahiyon said \"we are also a theater, art space, live music venue, cafe and restaurant. All of these elements combine to give the space a unique feel and energy. Almost any night you come here you will find yourself dancing next to people in the wildest of costumes in a super carefree spirit of expression.\" \nJonas Young-Borra is a writer, musician and singer/guitarist in the band, Young-Borra.
