It could be that she inherited it from her dad side of the family. However, I'm sure the struggle is real. However, she should embrace these features. I'm black and I'm not curvy at all. Actually while growing up I was called \"white people behind\" all the time. I used to hate my small butt but as I grow older I've learned to embrace my small butt. In fact, I'm 5 \"6\" and weighs 135lbs...in America that's the weight a 4\"11\" person should weigh to be considered healthy. I didn't inherit my mom thick hips and big butt. Instead I inherited my dad's slimmer figure. I'm happy to say that I've learned to love my body. Hopefully she will embrace her heritage on the her dad side of the family and know that no matter what she does she'll probably always be a bit thick. She's beautiful and look so healthy!! 0 | ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T23:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:00:25.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
