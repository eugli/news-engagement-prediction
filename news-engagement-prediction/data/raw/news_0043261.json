For them, talking about themselves seem to come naturally. But it is quite the opposite with Datuk Fahariyah Md Nordin of Puteri Umno.\nDespite having been in politics for 16 years, the 38-year-old, who was appointed senator in December, comes across as a shy and very private person, especially when it comes to opening up about herself.\n‘“I am not an interesting person! ‘’ she says somewhat apologetically.\n“I am so low profile that when people ask me about my personal life, I don’t know how to answer,” she confesses.\nSuch honesty is refreshing in this cynical world of politics.\nJohor-born Fahariyah, who has a masters degree in Human Development, says many people have asked about her low key image.\n“I have been in Puteri for 16 years. I’ve worked as a research officer with the (former) Johor Menteri Besar Tan Sri Ghani Othman’s office. I was private secretary to the Miti deputy minister Datuk Hamim Samsuri. I was one of (Datuk Seri) Azalina (Othman)’s officers, so by right, politically I am supposed to be ‘famous’ but I am not.\n“I guess that is because I am more of a worker. It’s not that publicity is not important in politics. It is. But to me, it is good enough for my bosses to have the publicity, not me. But now that I am a senator, I need to step up.”\nThird among six siblings – and from a family of non-politicians – Fahariyah got into politics at the age of 22 by being at the right place at the right time.\nShe was working at the Johor Mentri Besar’s office when Puteri Umno was being set up and Ghani picked her as the protem Puteri head for Johor.\nThe plan was for her to help set up Puteri in Johor then go off to further her studies.\n‘‘But like (what) people say ... ‘Once you are in politics, you cannot get away’. As you can see, I am still here. I don’t see politics as being all about power, politicking and backstabbing.\n“For me, it as a platform to help others. When you are in politics, you hold power and when you hold power, then you are able to help the people.’’\nBeing a politician was never part of her dream when she was growing up.\n‘’When I was young, I wanted to be somebody like (Tan Sri) Rafidah Aziz, who is vocal, makes good policies and helps people. She is a role model for women.’’\nAt the age of 22 then, Fahariyah admits she was very idealistic.\n“I was naïve and wanted to change the world and all that. As time goes by, one becomes more realistic and realises that it doesn’t work that way.”\nWhen she had a chat once with the former Deputy Prime Minister Tun Musa Hitam, who is a Johorean himself, he told her the challenge for politicians these days was to be able to strike a balance between realpolitik and the philosophy of politics, which is something she is trying to do.\nFahariyah’s appointment created quite a buzz within the party – about why she was picked over the more popular Puteri deputy chief Zahida Zarik Khan.\nAfter all, with the Umno Youth, it was the deputy, Khairul Azwan Harun, who was made senator.\nThere was even a WhatsApp message that went viral claiming Zahida was going to resign. But this was quickly denied by Zahida herself.\nSuch talk has, of course, reached Fahariyah but she says such “noises” don’t bother her.\n“I believe in rezeki . It is not about the position. I’ve got work to do. So the ‘noise’ goes in one ear and out the other. People will talk regardless of who is appointed.\n“I am sure the appointment was made based on certain criteria. Maybe it was because I am the oldest experience-wise in Puteri because I have been there 16 years. And I worked with a deputy minister and at the Natural Resource and Environment Ministry too, so it could be because of all these experiences.’’\nSome say even Puteri members don’t know Fahariyah all that well, because she is reserved, doesn’t share much of herself and is even a bit secretive, so her support among the grassroots is not strong.\nBut others like former Puteri exco member, Datuk Shahaniza Shamsuddin, who has worked with Fahariyah for years, describes her as “smart and very experienced”.\n“Her appointment is not only as a recognition to Puteri Umno but was an opportunity for Umno to highlight her as an icon to young Malay women.\n“She is well educated and I believe she is capable in voicing out issues related to young women,’’ says Shahaniza, who is the Kuala Sentul state assemblyman and is in the Pahang state exco.\nFor Fahariyah, she sees her senatorship as a platform for Puteri to talk about issues like environment, security, safety, jobs, education, the cost of living – issues that resonate with young people.\nShe believes young people – from the ages of 18 to 25 – have different concerns compared to older ones between 25 and 40.\n‘‘The main concern of those between 18 and 25 is finding a good job and getting married. Those over 25 would probably be starting a family soon, so their main concern is having a good pay, being able to buy things like diapers, milk, food for their kids, having a house, providing a good education and security for their children, the price of petrol and transport.\n“So, you can’t ‘blanket’ all their issues because the two groups have different needs. To her, youths of both genders have basically the same concerns but there are differences. Traditionally and psychologically, males are breadwinners, so their concern is to provide for their family.\n“Girls are different. Yes, they do want to own a house but they are more concerned about safety and security. They are concerned about getting a good salary but while guys wouldn’t mind jumping jobs for the experience (and better money), girls prefer stability.’’\nFahariyah says Malaysians these days are politically lethargic and thinks this is because everything is politicised to the point that the people do not see the positive side anymore, and listen only to what they want to hear.\nShe particularly likes Rural and Regional Development Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaacob’s idea of setting up a fully paid private Mara Junior Science College (MRSM).\nShe says boarding schools like MRSM were set up in the past to help the Malays especially those from the rural areas to get a good education, proper study environment and excellent coaching.\n“Those students have graduated and many are parents now and well-to-do. They want their own kids to go to MRSM because they know it is a good product. Why not let the well-to-do parents send their children to a private MRSM where they pay for it? So that the kampung kids don’t need to compete with them to get places in the free MRSM. \n“Kampung kids have less access to a good education environment compared to those in towns and from well-to-do families. If we base the entry into MRSM on academic results alone, the kampung kids won’t have the opportunity to get into good schools. \n“We can’t compare a child in KL who has 5As with a child from the kampung who obtained only 2As because the one from the town would have all the support, well-to-do and educated parents, tuition, while the one in the kampung would not.”\nWhile many worry about the declining standard of English in Malaysia, Fahariyah worries about the national language.\n“We are so focussed on English. I have a five-year-old daughter who speaks English better than Bahasa Malaysia. My other Malay girlfriends here talk about how their kids tak geti cakap Melayu (can’t even speak Malay).’’\nWhen she goes back to Ledang, it is the opposite, with many not being able to speak English.\nThen there are also those who send their children to religious schools. \n“It’s a scary mix. I worry where our country is heading to. Last time, we had things like bahasa jiwa bangsa but now the Malays are trying to be global. We are forgetting our roots, culture and traditions. \n“How many of our kids know about makyong , zapin , kudang kepang ? But if you talk to the Chinese or Indians, they know their culture and traditions. \n‘‘With the Malays, I fear our fundamentals like language, jati diri (resilience), culture are not that strong. No matter how modern or good you are, you must know your asal usul (origin) I worry about the identity and future of the country.’’\nShe says countries like Japan and Germany have 200-year-old policies that bind the people together and despite being developed, they are still able to maintain their language and culture.\n“For us, we don’t hold tight to our policies. The government might set a particular direction but this is not felt by all because it is not held on to strongly.’’\nAs a mother to a five-year-old and 11-month-old, she thinks the country is becoming a stressful place for children, where parents want to make sure their children could read by the age of three or four and “would be in a state of panic if their child is not able to read by the age of six’’.\n“Countries like Japan, however, are more concerned about teaching their children about life, how to be independent and courteous; while we are so concerned whether our kids can read and count rather than them having a fundamental basic life education,’’ says Fahariyah, who is the daughter-in-law of the former Wanita Umno deputy chief Datuk Kamilia Ibrahim.\nFor her, marrying into a politician’s family has its advantages because her accountant husband understands the demands that politics makes on her time.\n“One of us tries to be home with the children at night. If I am away, he makes sure he is at home.’’\nPuteri information chief Haryaty Hamzah thinks Fahariyah’s senatorship would help put Puteri on stronger footing.\nShe says the new senator, having been around for so long, is very experienced and knows a lot, procedure-wise.\n“People at the higher level know her and she has access to ministers because they all know her. Her networking with the higher ups within the party and government agencies is good, so it would be easy to get things done. \n“Fahariyah is also someone who doesn’t like havoc or controversy. So we can rest assured there would be no hanky-panky. She will not embarrass the party or Puteri.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T02:47:08.915+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
