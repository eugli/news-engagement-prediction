Who would even want that? \nWe jest of course, but sometimes we can't help but feel like some footballers at the top of the game take their lavish lifestyle for granted. Article continues below \nFor some, it can be difficult to stay grounded if football is all you have ever known, however, the penny very quickly drops once you decide to retire. \nAll of a sudden, you are taken out of the bubble that is professional football and brought back into the real world.

Sometimes it is difficult,\" she continued. \n\"We could not easily go to Paris, Milan or New York back then for shopping. \n\"[Our stylist Danie Bles] would do it for us. But we are now having fun doing it ourselves!\" \nDoesn't it just make your heart bleed? No, us neither. \nHeitinga's comments have provoked a fierce response, even within his own country as one popular blog wrote: \n\"John is not the brightest spark in the country and normally he would have a sucky job in [his native town of] Alphen aan den Rijn. Yet he earned loads of money because he accidentally knew how to kick a ball. We are done with you!\" \nAs you can imagine, football fans have reacted in similar taste on Twitter.
