In a foreword to the report, Pavel Svoboda, the Czech chairman of the committee, writes: 'One important preliminary question affecting all policy areas is the extent to which transitional arrangements could be envisaged legally. 'It would seem to us that such arrangements could only be adopted by international agreement or a protocol to the treaties, which would require the unanimous agreement of the member states and ratification in accordance with their national constitutional tradition. 'It would seem difficult, if not impossible, to reach such an agreement before the end of the period provided for in Article 50.' Jeremy Corbyn accused the Prime Minister of a 'Hunger Games approach to Brexit' by refusing to guarantee the rights of European Union citizens in the UK. Jeremy Corbyn - pictured on the BBC last week - accused the PM of a 'Hunger Games approach to Brexit' Mr Corbyn told the newspaper the report showed 'the human cost of a Tory-style Brexit'. 'Families, jobs and homes are all in the balance,' he said. 'There must be an end to this Hunger Games approach to Brexit negotiations, which gives no consideration to EU nationals in our country or British nationals living abroad.' Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: 'This issue could have been settled from the start if the Government had done the right thing and made clear EU citizens who have made the UK their home can remain indefinitely. 'Instead, millions of people on both sides of the channel are being left in limbo and faced with agonising uncertainty over their futures. 'Antagonising our European partners is no way to get a good deal for Britain and for the many UK citizens living in EU countries.' A Home Office spokesman said: 'This Government has been clear, that we want to protect the status of EU nationals already living here and the only circumstances in which that wouldn't be possible is if British citizens' rights in European member states were not protected in return. 'The Prime Minister has reiterated the need for an agreement as soon as possible as part of the negotiations to leave the EU.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel is said to be among the EU leaders insisting a reciprocal deal on rights for citizens cannot be done before the Brexit talks Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:33:26.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
