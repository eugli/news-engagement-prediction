(File photo: Reuters) A \nSINGAPORE: Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC), Singapore’s second-biggest lender, on Tuesday (Feb 14) reported a bigger-than-expected 18 per cent drop in quarterly net profit, dragged down by a 57 per cent jump in bad debt charges. \nOCBC's net profit came in at S$789 million in the three months ending December, versus S$960 million a year earlier and an average forecast of S$856 million from six analysts polled by Reuters. \nNet interest income for the quarter was 7 per cent lower at S$1.25 million, the bank said, citing the “continued compression” in customer loan yields. Non-interest income was down 4 per cent at S$926 million, as fee income growth was more than offset by lower net trading income and life assurance profit. \nNet allowances for loans and other assets rose to S$305 million, highlighting the sector's growing exposure to the stressed oil services sector. \nNet profit for the year was S$3.47 billion, down 11 per cent from the previous year. \nThe bank has proposed a final dividend of S$0.18 a share. - REUTERS/CNA/cy", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T06:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:22:10.832+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
