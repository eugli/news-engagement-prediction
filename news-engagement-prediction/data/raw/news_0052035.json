Thursday’s double, meanwhile, will air at 8pm for one hour in an episode focusing on Debbie contemplating sneaking through passport control to take Sarah Sugden to Prague. \nWhile it might be a bit of a frustration not to have our Emmerdale fix, we could use the night off to bask in the Robron joy brought by Maxine Alderton’s wedding episode yesterday – before it all falls apart when Aaron is sentenced. \nWe’ve seen the next episode and, trust us, you might need this extra night to prepare for the emotion. \nSo to summarise, Emmerdale airs next on Thursday 23rd February at 7pm and then for one hour at 8pm. Coronation Street airs tonight (Wednesday 22nd) at the earlier time of 7pm before the Brit Awards 2017 kick off at 7:30pm. \nSorted!
