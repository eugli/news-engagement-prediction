Later, as an artist, she envisioned a world obliterated by dots, channeling her hallucinations into drawings of flowers and abstract, swirling patterns. For the new roving exhibit “ Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors ,” opening February 23 in Washington D.C., Kusama took her signature dot motif to the furthest extent possible — infinity.\nAt the Hirshhorn Museum, visitors will experience Kusama’s version of infinity in six mirrored installation rooms illuminated by LED lights — infinity rooms that expand a viewer’s sense of time and space and suggest a cosmic hyperreality. Kusama has said she’s interested in the concept of “self-obliteration,” seeing her kaleidoscopic installations as connecting her viewers so completely to their surrounding environment that their sense of self is lost. Other visitors may see their reflections repeated infinitely in the exhibit’s mirrors and consider themselves separate from the set — a sea of polka-dotted props and phallic floor pillows.\nThe accompanying book Infinity Mirrors , published February 1 by Prestel, traces the artist’s colorful, decades-long career from evocative pastel drawings to cheerful paintings and bespeckled sculptures. Referring to the Phalli’s Field installation shown in the slideshow ahead, she tells Hirshhorn Museum director Melissa Chiu: “I wanted to show that I am one of the elements — one of the dots among the millions of dots in the universe.”\nIn a previous interview that appears in the book, Kusama explains how World War II cast a shadow over her childhood in Japan and influenced how she came to value personal and creative freedom. At age 13, she was sent to work in a military factory to sew parachutes for the Japanese army. “American B29’s [flew] in broad daylight,” she recalls. “The air-raid alert went off every day, so that I could barely feel my life. My adolescence was spent in the closed darkness; especially because of the war, many dreams I had rarely, if at all, saw the light of day.”\nIn 1957, at the age of 28, Kusama emigrated to the U.S. — first to Seattle, then to New York City. “For art like mine — art that does battle at the boundary between life and death, questioning what we are and what it means to live and die — [Japan] was too small, too servile, too feudalistic, and too scornful of women,” she once explained . “My art needed a more unlimited freedom, and a wider world.” Action paintings charged with masculine aggression were popular in downtown New York’s art scene at the time. In contrast, Kusama’s work was intricately detailed and required a significant amount of studio time, prompting some critics to relate her practice to women’s domestic work. She described her artwork during this period as inwardly focused: “I think only of myself when I make my artwork.”\nKusama later moved back to Japan and checked into a mental hospital for psychosis; there, she continued to paint and write surrealist stories and poems. In 1993 she became the first solo artist to represent Japan at the Venice Biennale, solidifying her prominence on the international museum circuit. Kusama rarely makes public appearances but when she does she dresses boldly — in floor-length polka-dot dresses, neon-colored wigs, and mismatched socks that mirror her artwork.\nClick ahead to preview photos from the book, including one recent photo of the artist in her studio wearing her signature red anime wig.\n“Yayoi Kusama: Infinity Mirrors” will be on view at the Hirschhorn Museum from February 23 to May 14. \nBegin Slideshow Related Yayoi Kusama Reimagines The Little Mermaid Tags: gallery yayoi kusama art artists slideshows Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories In True Sisterly Love, Gigi Hadid Covertly Steals Bella Hadid’s Clothes Trump Reportedly Upset That Sean Spicer Was Spoofed by a Woman on SNL Christie Brinkley Levitates In the Latest Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Most Viewed Stories Sean Spicer Chews and Swallows 35 Pieces of Gum Every Day Before Noon Ivanka Trump’s Brand Issues an Even Longer Response to Nordstrom News I Wish I Were Larry David’s Cool Daughter Unsung Hero Eva Mendes Came Up With One of La La Land ’s Best Lines The Married Woman Contemplating Sperm Donors Vogue Arabia ’s First Editor Is Literally a Princess Man Arrested for Murder of Queens Jogger Karina Vetrano Chelsea Peretti and Jordan Peele’s Beyoncé-Inspired Pregnancy Announcement Rules People Are Taking to Twitter to Show Trump What It Really Means to Dress Like a Woman Madame Clairevoyant: Horoscopes for the Week of February 5 From Our Partners Fashionista \nLady Gaga Wears Versace to a Very Glittery 2017 Super…\ngoop \nUnder $150: Après-Ski\nHuffPost Lifestyle \nThe Obamas Head Straight To Palm Springs For A…\npowered by PubExchange \nMost Popular Video On The Cut These Cats Behave Like Melodramatic Humans The Latest on the Cut 27 mins ago In True Sisterly Love, Gigi Hadid Covertly Steals Bella Hadid’s Clothes According to Bella, of course.\n1:07 a.m. Trump Reportedly Upset That Sean Spicer Was Spoofed by a Woman on SNL And now Rosie O’Donnell wants to play Steve Bannon.\nYesterday at 10:39 p.m. Christie Brinkley Levitates In the Latest Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue The 63-year-old showed off her magical powers while posing alongside her two daughters.\nYesterday at 10:00 p.m. On Vanderpump Rules , Katie’s Wedding Tyranny Continues Exactly zero of Katie’s wedding-related events have not included a fight.\nYesterday at 5:30 p.m. Yayoi Kusama Made the Ultimate Instagram Exhibit The artist’s mirrored infinity rooms open in Washington, D.C., this month.\nYesterday at 5:20 p.m. Eva Mendes Came Up With One of La La Land’s Best Lines The unsung hero of La La Land .\nYesterday at 5:18 p.m. L.L.
