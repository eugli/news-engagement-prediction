It also places a four-month-long ban on new refugees. Critics say he's making good on campaign promises to instate a “Muslim ban.” The administration says it's fulfilling a promise to make American safer. \nTrump fired Yates hours after she spoke out, sending a message to other administration employees who may seek to defy his orders. He said that she had \"betrayed the Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the United States.\"’ Could you pass a US citizenship test? \nHer refusal to comply comes largely as a symbolic resistance to the order. The Senate expects to vote on Trump’s choice for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, this week. If confirmed, it is likely that Mr. Sessions would comply with the directive. \nWhile it’s uncommon for Justice Department officials to publicly break with the executive branch, the controversial nature of the ban has stirred fears and serious opposition across the country, making Yates far from alone in her concerns. \nThousands of protesters and slews of Democratic leaders gathered at several airports around the nation this weekend to decry the order. A federal judge in New York eventually called for a temporary stay on the ban late Saturday. Several hundred green card and visa holders from the banned nations have since been allowed to return to the US. \nMany were detained for hours over the weekend, culminating in a logistical nightmare as immigration officials tried to interpret the new order. \nBut some in Trump’s own inner circle have also raised concerns with the order’s hasty rollout. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, and Rex Tillerson, who is awaiting confirmation to lead the State Department, all told sources close to them they had not received detailed information about the orders until Trump signed them Friday. GOP lawmakers say they were not consulted in drafting the orders, and some note that the logistics could have been handled with more nuance. \nTrump also demoted Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Daniel Ragsdale later Monday night. He will return to his previous position as deputy director, while Thomas Homan, the agency’s executive associate director, will take the lead role. \nNo explanation was given for the move. \nWhite House officials have made it clear that resisting the order will not be an option open to other administration employees.
