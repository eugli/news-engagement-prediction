In China, the technology company Ant Financial has grown to 450 million users since spinning off from the e-commerce giant Alibaba in 2014. Ant Financial now processes a majority of online payments in China. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Ant Financial has used its position as an electronic, phone-based wallet to grab lots of other financial business from Chinese consumers, offering online loans, insurance and investment advice to its hundreds of millions of customers. China has four of the five most valuable financial technology start-ups in the world, according to CB Insights, with Ant Financial leading the way at $60 billion. And investments in financial technology rose 64 percent in China last year, while they were falling 29 percent in the United States, according to CB Insights. In Africa, the financial industry has been shaken up by the rise of new forms of mobile phone-based payment systems like M-Pesa, in Kenya, which was started by the local mobile phone operator rather than a bank, and has risen to become the dominant form of payment in the country. The obvious reason that financial start-ups have not achieved the same level of growth in the United States is that most Americans already have access to a relatively functional set of financial products, unlike in Africa and China. Some start-ups looked at becoming banks, so they could offer deposit insurance — among other things — but they generally found that getting a bank charter required more time and money than is available to even the most successful start-ups. This left most start-ups reliant on banks to hold and move any money they collected from customers. “Operating in America, you needed to get a gatekeeper to approve your access to the networks,” said Josh Reich, who sold his banking start-up, Simple, to the Spanish banking giant BBVA. “If we wanted to touch their money, we needed to be part of the banking system.” Online lenders were particularly ambitious in trying to take on the banks from outside the system. Lending Club, which makes personal loans, and OnDeck, which focuses on small business loans, initially grew swiftly and went public, but both companies have run up against the limits of how fast a lending business can grow without being a bank. The online lenders have struggled with the high cost of acquiring new customers through marketing, which is not as necessary in other industries that have been disrupted by technology. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story At a more fundamental level, online lenders realized how hard it was to fund the new loans they wanted to give out without having access to cheap deposits, as the banks do. The shares of both Lending Club and OnDeck are now trading far below where they were on the day they went public. One notable success among the new lenders has been SoFi, or Social Finance, but even it has captured only about 250,000 customers, as compared to the 160 million users of Snapchat, the social network that was founded the same year. Start-ups focused on improving payments have had more success — the most valuable recent American technology start-up is Stripe, which helps new companies accept online payments. But Stripe and other payment start-ups like Square are all built on top of the existing credit card and banking infrastructure and have not posed any type of fundamental threat or challenge to the existing giants. “We are explicitly not a threat to the banks,” Tim Drinan, a spokesman for Stripe, said. “From our perspective the banks and card networks have built something pretty good and pretty hard to replicate.” Perhaps the most ambitious recent project aimed at upending the banks was Bitcoin, which promised a new way to hold and move money, totally outside the existing banking system. The virtual currency has not taken off as a way to hold and spend money on a day-to-day basis, as many of its enthusiasts had predicted. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story At the same time, in a pattern that has been repeated elsewhere in the financial industry, the big banks have been making big investments aimed at harnessing the technology underlying Bitcoin — known as the blockchain — for their own purposes. Tim Swanson, an early Bitcoin follower and analyst who now works with the blockchain consulting firm R3, said that Bitcoin wasn’t able to fulfill the marketing promises that were made for it back in 2012. “It may take some time, but if there is anyone that has the capital base and the developer base to see this through, it’s the banks for sure,” Mr. Swanson said.
