Restaurants, Businesses Participate in Immigrant Strike February 15, 2017 4:48 PM (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) \nPHILADELPHIA — Organizers in cities across the U.S. are telling immigrants to miss class, miss work and not shop on Thursday as a way to show the country how important they are to America’s economy and way of life. \n“A Day Without Immigrants” actions are planned in cities including Philadelphia, Washington, Boston and Austin, Texas. \nSeveral D.C. businesses and restaurants will participate in the strike. In support of our people & #ADayWithoutImmigrants Thurs 2/16 we will not open @jaleo DC CC MD, @zaytinya or @oyameldc #ImmigrantsFeedAmerica \n— José Andrés (@chefjoseandres) February 14, 2017 Our founder @andyshallal is an immigrant in solidarity #ADayWithoutImmigrants . We will be closed on Thurs. Immigrants make America great! pic.twitter.com/X6evbrp9yZ \n— Busboys and Poets (@busboysandpoets) February 15, 2017 \nThe protest comes in response to President Donald Trump and his 1-month-old administration. The Republican president has pledged to increase deportation of immigrants living in the country illegally, build a wall along the Mexican border, and ban people from certain majority-Muslim countries from coming into the U.S. He also has blamed high unemployment on immigration. \nEmployers and institutions in some cities were already expressing solidarity Wednesday with immigrant workers. Washington restaurateur John Andrade said he would close his businesses Thursday, and David Suro, owner of Tequilas Restaurant in Philadelphia and a Mexican immigrant, said he also planned to participate. \nThe Davis Museum at Wellesley College in Massachusetts said it would remove or shroud all artwork created by or given to the museum through Feb. 21. \nOrganizers in Philadelphia said they expect hundreds of workers and families to participate. \n“Our goal is to highlight the need for Philadelphia to expand policies that stop criminalizing communities of color,” said Erika Almiron, executive director of Juntos, a nonprofit group that works with the Latino immigrant community. “What would happen if massive raids did happen? What would the city look like?” \nAlmiron said that while community groups have not seen an uptick in immigration raids in the city, residents are concerned about the possibility. \nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney is among leaders in several cities nationwide who have vowed to maintain their “sanctuary city” status and decline to help federal law enforcement with deportation efforts. \nMany people who make the choice to skip work Thursday will not be paid in their absence, but social media posts encouraging participation stressed that the cause is worth the sacrifice. \nFollow @CBSDC on Twitter \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
