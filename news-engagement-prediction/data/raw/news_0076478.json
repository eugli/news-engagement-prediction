Photo: Chris Sant Fournier \nA total of €1.4 billion in state aid will be paid throughout the 18-year period of the government contract with the power station consortium Electrogas, according to the European Commission. \nThe information of the amount emerges from the European Commission's official journal. \nCommission documents published last week show that Electrogas will get paid €77.56 million a year by the government. The overall budget for the state aid will amount to €1.4 billion, they show. \nThis means Electrogas will recoup the cost of the €450 million power station in under six years. \nThe aid will be paid through the long-term power purchase and gas supply agreements agreed with Electrogas. \nBrussels said the state aid took the form of payments that provided an economic advantage to Electrogas as they ensured a certain rate of return and a steady revenue stream. \nIt said the rate of return for Electrogas was in line with similar projects and the company would not be overcompensated for the services provided. \nOpposition leader Simon Busuttil tore up sections of the contracts during a parliamentary debate two weeks ago. \nThe state aid for the new gas-fired power station was approved by the European Commission in January. In an official letter to the government, the Commission expressed its regret that Malta had put the aid in question into effect in breach of article 108(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. \nThe provision says that the Commission should be informed of any plans to grant state aid in sufficient time to enable it to submit its comments. \nNo mention of this breach or the extent of the state aid being given to Electrogas has ever been made by the Minister within the Office of the Prime Minister, Konrad Mizzi, who handles energy projects. \nA spokesman for Dr Mizzi earlier this month told Times of Malta no state aid had been granted yet. \nIn its decision, the European Commission flagged the fact that when an expression of interest for the power station project was published by the government in 2013, no mention was made of the security of supply agreement. « Motorcyclist   Advert \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T10:47:43.654+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
