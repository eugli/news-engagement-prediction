(File photo) - + The study by INRIX Inc released last week which ranked Bangkok 12th in the world for having the worst traffic, and number one in Asia in 2016, may have come as no surprise to many. But expats living here have different views. \nEllyas Enda Hadinata Bangun, 24, a volunteer from Indonesia said that compared with traffic in Jakarta, which was ranked 22nd, Bangkok traffic is much better. \n\"I used to be stuck in traffic for two hours, with my car not moving an inch,\" said Mr Ellyas. \nIt is common in Bangkok to see people rush out before sunrise and then see them rush out of their offices to avoid the evening rush hour. Some families leave home at 5 am to drop their children off at school before the parents go off to work. \nMax Glickman, 25, from Los Angeles said the first time he came to Thailand, the traffic in Bangkok did not shock him, but the way people drive did. \n\"Buses think that they are motorbikes and that they can just switch lanes and cut in front of you,\" said Mr Glickman. \nDeputy superintendent Noppadol Kanchanabandhu, from Lumpini police station, agreed Thais did not have discipline when driving. The police are trying to reduce traffic jams and illegal driving by using modern technology. \nHe said cameras record and detect people who are out of line or violate traffic rules, and police mail photos of their offences along with a fine to their homes. The number of people who break the law is decreasing. \n\"People are more careful when they know we have placed a camera somewhere,\" said Pol Lt Col Noppadol. Besides the lack of road discipline, the number of vehicles in Bangkok is another big cause of traffic problems. \nTo own a car is seen as a symbol of success. In 2011, when the Yingluck Shinawatra government launched the first-car scheme, which offered a tax break for middle-class car buyers, more than 1.25 million people signed up for it. \nThe number of new vehicles registered in Bangkok was 1,072,040 and 1,084,080 in 2012 and 2013 respectively, compared with 871,502 last year. Currently, over 9,395,000 vehicles in total are registered in Bangkok. \nFor Gert Haenssig, 65, from Germany, Bangkok's roads are more dangerous than they were when he first arrived in 1992, but added the arrival of public transport is certainly more fun and interesting than being stuck in a a car for hours on end.
