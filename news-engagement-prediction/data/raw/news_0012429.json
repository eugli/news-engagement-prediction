The Speaker said: \"We value our relationship with the United States. If a state visit takes place, that is way beyond and above the pay grade of the Speaker.\" \"However, as far as this place is concerned I feel very strongly that our opposition to racism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary are hugely important considerations in the House of Commons.\"British Prime Minister Theresa May invited Trump to make a state visit to the UK on her recent trip to the US last month. Last week, nearly two million people signed a petition calling for Trump's state visit to be cancelled in just days after it was announced. MPs are to debate the issue in Westminster Hall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T13:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:04:33.279+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
