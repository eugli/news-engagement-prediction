He made a conscious effort to drop from 255 pounds to 225 after his first season at Lehigh to cut off “bad weight” and to improve his conditioning level. \nSince then, he’s gained some weight back in a leaner and stronger build. \n“I didn’t really have the ability to play at that fast pace [freshman year] ... Over the course of four years I’ve had to increase my minutes per game and now I’m playing above 30 minutes per game,” Kempton says. “That’s not something I think I’d be able to do unless I made that change.” *** \nCollege basketball in the 1990s was ripe with transcendent centers — from Shaquille O’Neal to Alonzo Mourning, Marcus Camby to Tim Duncan. For players growing up in that era, there were a ton of styles to pick up. Many of today’s centers have studied more contemporary styles. \nMORE: How good does your defense have to be to win a title? \nLammers, a San Antonio native, was quick to mention Duncan as a role model for how to act on and off the court, but when it comes to playing style, he’s gravitated toward Mavericks forward/center Dirk Nowitzki and his extraordinary shooting ability for a 7-footer. \n“I think I saw some Sports Science thing about his fadeaway shot and how it’s almost physically impossible for anyone to block it,” Lammers says. “So I’ve tried to incorporate something like that into my game.” \nWelsh mentions Hornets center Cody Zeller and Kempton names Grizzlies center Marc Gasol and Hornets forward Frank Kaminsky as players to watch and copy. \nKempton says he most admires Gasol’s footwork under the basket as well as his passing ability. \n“Just with his quick moves under the basket and his footwork, that’s something that I really try to pay attention to and really take from him,” Kempton says. *** \nNo one can say for sure how the center position will evolve. But Lammers says he thinks there will always be a spot for traditional centers if the talent is there. He’s played against plenty of post-up players that were equally hard to defend as mid-range shooters. \n“I think if you’re good enough at what you do, you’ll always be able to find a position on the basketball team,” Lammers says. “Even though there is a transition to a more versatile center, if you’re good enough of a low post player and can be effective, you’ll still find a place on the team. \nKempton says this trend toward versatile centers is a regular fluctuation that’s bound to change again. \n“I think before my lifetime is up, it’ll transition back to that big body, back-to-the-basket type of center that we were used to seeing 20 years ago. It’ll have those normative fluctuations,” he says. “That’s part of what makes this game interesting.” \nNo matter what the future holds, the advice for prospective centers remains consistent among all three big men: Be willing to adapt and don’t focus on just one aspect of play. \n“It’s just about trying to make strides every day, whether it’s getting in better shape or working on shots or working on defense,” Welsh says. “The game is continuing to develop where there are more possessions being played ... it’s just one of those things where you have to keep up.” Advertisement ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:28:57.035+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
