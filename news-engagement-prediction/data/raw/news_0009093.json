ADVERTISEMENT \nCanlobo’s husband, Christopher Canlobo, eluded arrest. \nSeized from the suspects were 1,000 grams of shabu worth P6 million. \nRallos said they earlier received information about the illegal activities of the couple. \nPDEA-7 conducted surveillance operations and hatched an entrapment operation. \n“They have been selling large amounts of shabu to their customers,” Rallos said. \nTwo days ago, the couple allegedly got three to four kilos of shabu from a source in Muntinlupa City. \nThe suspects could dispose a kilo of shabu every week, Rallos said. \nSPO4 Nestor Canlobo, said he had been reminding his younger brother to stop peddling illegal drugs. \nChristopher surrendered to the Talisay City Police Office last December during the implementation of the Oplan Tokhang, a campaign where policemen knocked on the doors of drug suspects to encourage them to stop their illegal activities. \nChristopher, however, continued peddling drugs. \nSought for comment, Luz said her husband already stopped selling drugs. “Dili to amo ang drugs nga nakuha sa among balay. (We don’t own the packs of shabu recovered inside our home),” she said. \nCharges for violating Republic Act 9165 or the Comprehensive Dangerous Act of 2002, particularly for selling illegal drugs, will be filed against Luz at the Talisay City Prosecutor’s Office. \nThe other suspects will be charged with illegal possession of drugs.
