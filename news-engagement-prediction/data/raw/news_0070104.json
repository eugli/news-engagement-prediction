WAIKATO REGIONAL COUNCIL \nDead eels from the toxic discharge. \nThe council incident response team traced the contaminated stream and stormwater system back to a retirement village that was having its roof stripped for repainting. \nThe subsequent investigation found Chemwash Hamilton Ltd had completed the work at the retirement village without capturing the chemicals it was using or managing them in an environmentally safe manner. \nThe conviction and fine was imposed this week in the Auckland District Court by Judge David Fitzpatrick, who stated the company's activities were \"at least reckless\", and the steps it had taken to protect against a discharge into the environment were \"completely inadequate\". WAIKATO REGIONAL COUNCIL \nBanded kokopu were victims of the significant fish kill at Paeroa last year. \nCouncil investigations manager Patrick Lynch said today that \"a company that deals with acutely toxic chemicals should have had exemplary measures in place to manage the risk to the environment\". \n\"We would like to acknowledge the quick work by Paeroa locals, who attempted to save some of the dying fish and contacted the council promptly. \n\"This was a completely avoidable incident. We are extremely disappointed with the actions of Chemwash and trust this fine will remind all users of toxic chemicals to ensure that they are managed properly.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T04:58:58.186+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
