I say this because it appears that Suzuki has issued a recall for a minor issue affecting some of their 1996 Cappuccino roadsters. And by “some,” I mean “one.” \nThis notice seems to have been first brought to the attention of the non-that-one-Cappuccino-owner population via this tweet . Advertisement \nHere’s the recall notice from Suzuki ; translated, it reads: \nContents of trouble: There is a cylinder block sold as a replenishment part that does not have embossing of the prime mover “K6A”. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm the identity with the vehicle inspection certificate on vehicles equipped with the cylinder block. \nContent of improvement: Replace the prime mover model with a cylinder block that has been engraved. \nSo, it looks like the cylinder block on the 658cc engine is missing the identifying K6A stamp, which seems like that could cause an issue for the car to receive its inspection certificate. Advertisement \nWhy did this just now become a recall-worthy issue? Does Japan only decide to check the engine block identification stamp when the car turns 21? I’m confused. \nAmazingly, the solution seems to be to replace the whole engine with one that has a properly stamped engine block. \nThey can’t just stamp the engine block somewhere while it’s in the car? Sponsored \nStill, that’s not the best part. The best part is this: \nSee that? In the ‘Number of vehicles subject to service campaign?’ part? There’s one. One car. That’s it. That’s the whole recall.

Get your car to your Suzuki dealer! This is a recall , after all. If you don’t get it stamped, post-haste, Suzuki might send a helicopter to your house, pick up your little Kei car, fly it to a factory, stamp it, and send it back with a terse note from the original builder demanding you take better care of your car. \nSuzuki is really, really counting on you to get this recall settled.
