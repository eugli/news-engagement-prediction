Report's key recommendations to minimise risk and exposure: All Mount Isa residents, particularly young children, should have their blood lead levels monitored Review pet ownership in areas with elevated lead concentrations in the soils Promoting personal hygiene, including washing children's hands regularly and minimising them sucking non-food items Continuing ways to minimise the transfer of dusts, particularly those containing lead, from the mining and processing areas to the city Emphasising the importance of a clean home environment Consider replacing carpets with hard flood coverings Washing homegrown fruit and vegetables Maintaining a healthy diet. \nThe report also found inhaling lead in the air was a relatively small risk and that \"the major source of lead exposure was via ingestion in the community and was from air particles that were on the ground from deposition as fallout\". \nIt identified small children as the most vulnerable to the heavy metal, because it could cause significant health impacts, including impairing their development. \nThe report also found mine emissions could travel for kilometres right across the north-west Queensland city. \nThe mine's chief operating officer, Mike Westerman, who lives in the city with his children, said it was a safe place to live if people did the right thing. \n\"I don't think there's another area where you've got such a large industrialised complex on the doorstep of a town of around ... 24,000,\" he said. \n\"Our focus here is making sure that that interaction doesn't result in any harm to the community. \n\"This report recommends that there are certain behaviours and certain changes, simple changes that people can make to their lives that will allow them not to have elevated lead levels.\" 'We don't know we're fine': mother \nTeacher Olivia Davis lives close to the mine and can see its stacks from her front door. \nShe fights a constant battle to keep on top of the dust outside, while inside her house she wet-wipes her home and keeps the windows shut. \n\"We think Mount Isa is a great community to grow up in, especially with the small children that we have,\" Ms Davis said. \nBut she said there were doubts. \n\"We, I guess, don't know that we're fine because we haven't done any lead level testing with either of the kids â€” Summer [her son] finds it too invasive and he's a bit little,\" Ms Davis said.

(ABC News: Donna Field) Hope for less invasive test for residents \nA survey of the city's children nine years ago found more than 10 per cent had concerning blood lead levels. \nSince then, the mine has reduced emissions markedly and also pays for people to have their children tested for lead, but very few do . \nLocal MP Robbie Katter heads an alliance advising the community about the issue, but even he has never been tested. Photo: For more than a century, Mount Isa's vast mineral deposits have been the lifeblood of the region. (ABC News: Donna Field) \nMr Katter hopes a new less invasive test will see more people checked. \n\"We're looking at capillary testing now to try and trap those kids basically into getting that data because we're so eager to get that data,\" he said. \nThe new report also urged Glencore to do more to minimise dust containing heavy metals, which was something the mine management said it was committed to. \n\"I think the concept of continuous improvement means we can always do better, however in our concept here is always going to be around risk mitigation given we're in such close proximity to that community,\" Mr Westerman said. Millions spent on environmental measures \nFor more than a century, Mount Isa's vast mineral deposits have been the lifeblood of the region, but it is only now there is recognition that comes at a cost to people that must be managed. Photo: The report found mine emissions could travel for kilometres right across the north-west Queensland city. (ABC News: Donna Field) \nThe mining operation is vast, involving open cut, underground and smelting. \nGlencore has spent $500 million on environmental measures since acquiring Mount Isa Mines (MIM) in 2003, and dramatically reduced emissions after implementing measures like dust capture systems, sealing roads and moving crushing facilities. \nLead emissions are down by 96 per cent since 2005-06, the National Pollutant Inventory said. \nThe city also has one of the most comprehensive air-monitoring systems in Australia and the mine shuts if emissions spikes to dangerous levels.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:08:15.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
