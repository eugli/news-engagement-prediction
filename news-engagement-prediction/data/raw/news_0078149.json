highlights Celebrated New York hotel closes February 28 A huge renovation project will see some rooms turned into luxury condos (CNN) New York's legendary Waldorf Astoria hotel has hosted kings, queens, presidents and movie stars -- but for the next three years, not even royalty will be able to reserve a room here.\nThe 86-year-old hotel, bought by China's Ambang Insurance Group in 2014 for $1.95 billion, closed its doors on February 28, 2017 for a major renovation project that will reportedly see many of its 1,400 rooms turned into apartments. While the art deco landmark's rooms might be off limits for now, the expertise of its longest-serving bellman, Jalali \"Jim E.\" Eldrissi, isn't. Eldrissi, whose destiny has been linked to the Waldorf Astoria since 1966, retired in January after 51 years of greeting guests.
