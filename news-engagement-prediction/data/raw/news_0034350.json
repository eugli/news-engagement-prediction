Sunday. It was a somewhat subdued celebration compared to how the rest of the Grammy attendees and honorees fêted Music's Biggest Night. \nIf anyone deserved a drink after the ceremony, it was host James Corden . He was spotted partying at Republic Records' bash, sponsored by Absolut, Freixenet and Pryma, at Catch L.A. Other attendees included Paris Jackson , Heidi Klum , Joel Madden and Nicole Richie . A few reality stars—including The Bachelor Nick Viall and Bachelorette JoJo Fletcher —made the guest list.

News. \"Everybody wanted to take pics with him.\" But it was actually French Montana who \"was the life of the party. He was talking to everyone .\" Photos Todd Williamson/Getty Images Rachel Murray/Getty Images for Republic Records \nWarner Music Group's Annual Grammy Celebration was almost too popular—just ask Ed Sheeran , who was denied entry. It wasn't his fault, though: The fire marshal was put on crowd control to protect guests' safety. \"They weren't letting anyone in,\" an insider says. \"They pulled a wall over to block the red carpet.\" A few celebrities did manage to make it inside, including Twenty One Pilots ' Tyler Joseph . After \"Stressed Out\" won Best Pop Duo/Group Performance earlier that evening, Joseph told E! News it was the \"most exhilarating moment of our careers.\" Other partygoers included Charli XCX , Adrian Grenier , Ciara Ty Dolla $ign and Russell Wilson . \nLady Gaga ruled over Interscope's Grammy After-Party at the Peppermint Club. The \"John Wayne\" singer danced with everyone from Ashlee Simpson to John Travolta . Meanwhile, her American Horror Story: Hotel co-star Kathy Bates enjoyed a drink during Palmer Reed 's concert. Gaga also introduced her new boyfriend, a CAA agent Christian Carino , to all the famous guests. \nJonas Tahlin , CEO of Absolut Elyx, hosted a party at a private residence that brought out the likes of Jhené Aiko , Iggy Azalea , Fonzworth Bentley , Big Sean , Kandi Burruss , Desiigner , and Chris Ivery . \" 2 Chainz performed,\" an insider reveals. \"Everyone went nuts on the dance floor.\" Photos \nGrammys 2017 Red Carpet Arrivals Araya Diaz/Getty Images for Republic Records \nThings got wild at 1Oak, where Lana Del Ray , Wiz Khalifa , Ne-Yo and Tyga partied. \"The whole club was covered in dark red roses designed by Petals L.A.,\" a source says. \"There were posters of Rihanna 's face everywhere and signs that read 'Club Anti.' And candles were lit everywhere.\" \n\"It was really dead until 1 a.m.,\" the source adds, \"and then it started getting really crazy.\" \nVanderpump Rules ' James Kennedy was one of the first to arrive at 11:30; 2 Chainz showed up about 15 minutes later with his crew. \"They were ordering rounds of bottles and sparklers,\" a source says. Moments later, Busta Rhymes was \"hanging by the bar, talking to a group of girls.\" \nFrench Montana was seen \"exchanging phone numbers\" with a mystery brunette. \"She handed him her phone and she put his number in it and gave it back. He tried to be discreet about it,\" the source reveals. \"They flirted a bit, but nothing major. He was mostly hanging with his buds.\" After spending most of the evening with her church friends, Gomez joined her boyfriend inside. \nRihanna arrived at 1:30 a.m. in frilly Marc Jacobs dress; she headed to her table behind the DJ booth, and G-Eazy showed up soon after. With Jason Derulo and The Weeknd in the crowd, Migos performed after 2 a.m. \"The club was packed,\" the source says. \"You could barely move.\" \n—Reporting by Alessandra Mortellaro, Holly Passalaqua, Alli Rosenbloom TAGS/ 2017 Grammys , Grammys , Parties , Exclusives , Music , Celebrities , Top Stories Additional Privacy Statement Your information may be shared with other NBCUniversal businesses and used to better tailor our services and advertising to you.
