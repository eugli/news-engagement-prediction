Squatters: The building was occupied by the same group who recently took over properties in Eaton Square and Grosvenor Gardens (PA) \nCourt documents shown cited a Metropolitan Police royal specialist protection officer who flagged a \"potential security risk\" posed by the group. \nConcerns were raised that, if the occupiers accessed the adjoining roof, they could directly peer into the gardens of the royal grounds. \nBut one of the protesters insisted they were not \"going to do anything\". \nA witness statement filed to the High Court by Archie Riby-Williams, a director of owning company 18-19 Buckingham Gate Investments Limited said: \"At around 10.30am on February 23, I spoke with ... a royal specialist protection officer at Buckingham Palace who expressed his concern about the potential security risk to the Palace if the defendants gained access via the roof of the premises 18 and then 17 Buckingham Gate. Squatter: A banner reading \"Rogue Embassy\" hangs outside 19 Buckingham Gate (PA) \n\"If the defendants were to access the roof of 18 Buckingham Gate in particular, this would enable them to see directly into the garden of Buckingham Palace and this would, in fact, appear to be the defendants' objectives.\" \nSnipers stationed on the roof of Wellington Barracks were in \"regular contact\" with a next-door owner to raise concerns about the view into the palace gardens from the roof, the document said. \nSecurity considerations were further fuelled by a post on the group's social media feed, which said they had decided to relocate \"as close to the Queen's bedroom as possible\", it added. \nOne organiser later claimed the message was just a joke. A squatter moves out of their previous residence in Belgrave Place (Yui Mok/PA) \nIt is the third high-profile building the band of squatters, who claim to be part of the Autonomous Nation of Anarchist Libertarians, have entered this year. \nThey were evicted from a multimillion-pound property in Eaton Square, central London last month, before immediately moving into a nearby seven-storey building on Grosvenor Gardens. \nTheir latest home was festooned with banners, including one which read: \"Behind every great fortune lies a great crime.\" \nOwned by Bahraini Abdulrahman Aljasmi, it has stood derelict for decades, the group claimed, leading them to repurpose it as an embassy for \"indigenous people\" and \"nations that are not recognised\". \nImages posted on their social media group showed passers-by, including police officers, being targeted with water balloons. Queen's security 'threatened by squatters' in neighbouring building \nOne of the activists said: \"It is a very high-profile building. As a sport, it is an achievement even having a squat for a couple of days. \n\"It is an achievement to get as near as we can to Buckingham Palace, not that we are going to do anything. \n\"It is theatre for us, it is confrontation theatre.\" \nAnother added they intended to move from \"building to building\" throughout London. \nA Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: \"We never comment on security, which is a matter for the police.\" More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T10:45:58.986+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
