However, unlike big cities in other parts of the world, Karachi probably has the worst public transport system. Rusty vehicles, untrained drivers and no timetable make Karachi’s public transport inconsistent, unreliable and unsafe. \nRegarding Karachi Circular Railway (KCR), the minister said it was a significant project and it was being worked upon. “Karachi commissioner is heading a committee which will oversee the evacuation of the Railway’s encroached land in the city,” he said. \nThe total length of the KCR is 43.24 km of which 14.95 km will be on ground and 28.18 km will be elevated. The expected KCR ridership is 550,000 while there will be 24 stations of which 10 are to be on ground and 14 elevated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:35:59.679+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
