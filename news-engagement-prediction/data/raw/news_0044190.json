I’m a NATO fan but many of the countries in NATO, many of the countries that we protect, many of these countries are very rich countries – they are not paying their bills,” Trump said. \nThe new president also voiced support for the creation of what he calls “safe zones” in Syria and the wider Middle East in general. \n“We are going to have the Gulf States pay for those safe zones,” Trump told supporters at the event dubbed, “a campaign rally for America,” by the White House. \n“Instead of peace, we see wars that never end and conflicts that never seem to go away. We don’t fight to win; we fight politically correct wars,” he noted.

So, we’re going to keep our country safe,” Trump promised. \nThe idea of creating so-called safe zones in Syria has previously been endorsed by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey. \nMoscow and Damascus oppose the initiative. \n“Our American partners did not consult with Russia [regarding the ‘safe zones’]. It is their sovereign decision,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last month when the idea first emerged. \nAccording to a document reportedly seen by Reuters last month, Trump wants the Pentagon and State Department to compile a plan for setting up the ‘safe zones’ within 90 days of the presidential order being signed. That draft, however, did not provide any details on what the zones would require in terms of security or where they might be located. \nREAD MORE: Stop foreign cheating: Trump vows penalties for companies that outsource American jobs \nThe US president argued that creating such zones could help cope with the influx of migrants not only to the EU but also into the US, as Trump defended his decision to issue an executive order banning citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries from travel to the US. \n“The president has the right to keep people out if he feels it’s not in the best interests of our country,” Trump said promising to draw up a new executive order to replace the stalled one. \nHe wrapped up the speech with his trademark campaign slogan: “ We will make America great again…greater than ever before.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T03:33:38.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
