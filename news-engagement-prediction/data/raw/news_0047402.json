This year saw some unknown names making it big at the IPL auction. Check them out: \nThangarasu Natarajan (Rs. 3 crore, Kings XI Punjab; Base Price: Rs.10 lakh) : This 25-year-old left arm seamer hails from Chinappampatti, a small village in Tamil Nadu, and is the son of a daily-wages worker. His mother sells eateries on the road. Natarajan shot to fame when he claimed 27 wickets in the 2016 Tamil Nadu Premier League. After this he acquired the tag of a death-overs specialist. \nMohammad Siraj (Rs. 2.6 crore, Sunrisers Hyderabad; Base Price: Rs. 20 lakh) : The 22-year-old Siraj hails from a humble background. His father, Mohammed Ghouse, is an auto rickshaw driver in Hyderabad. Siraj caught everyone’s attention with his good show with the ball in Ranji Trophy and Syed Mushtaq Ali tournaments. In the recently-completed Ranji Trophy season, he played 9 matches and picked up 41 wickets averaging an impressive 18.92. \nKrishnappa Gowtham (Rs. 2 crore, Mumbai Indians, Base Price: Rs. 10 lakh) : This 28-year-old Bengaluru off-spinner credits his sudden rise to none other than the Indian spin legend, Erapalli Prasanna. Gowtham can also swing the bat. It was quite evident when he slammed a 74 off a mere 68 balls against the Australian side in the recently concluded warm-up match. 64 of his runs came in boundaries, four of which were monstrous sixes off Nathan Lyon . \nAniket Choudhary (Rs. 2 crore, Royal Challengers Bangalore, Base Price: Rs. 10 lakh) : With a Mitchell Starc-like action, Aniket is one of the main practice pacers preparing the Indian batsmen for the stiff Aussie challenge. The 28-year-old Rajasthan seamer was bought for 20 times his base price. \nBasil Thampi (Rs. 85 lakh, Gujarat Lions, Base Price: Rs 10 lakh) : The 23-year-old youngster from Kerala is known for his raw pace and hitting the 140 kmph mark on a regular basis. The journey for Basil was never a walk in the park. He wanted to leave cricket at the age of 19 to work in the Arabian gulf and support his family. It was only due to the influence of his mentor Prasad that he stuck to the game. \n@YahooCricket on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Matches ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:17:59.001+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
