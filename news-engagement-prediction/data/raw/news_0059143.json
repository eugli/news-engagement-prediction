Credit: UTV A north Belfast pensioner has been left devastated after heartless thieves broke into her house twice in a week and stole precious family heirlooms.\nAnne Bradley treasured many of the items of jewellery that were stolen because of the memories attached to them.\n“Some of them, I’ve had for years, they are sentimental, but there was one, it was a beautiful ring with 10 diamonds in it that belonged to my mother,” she said.\nThe burglars struck during the day while Anne and her grand-daughter were at the cinema.\n“Inside the two hours somebody was in and took all my jewellery, every bit of my jewellery,” she continued.\n“I thought I was going to pass out, I couldn’t talk. There’s a wee tiny box, in it is my husband’s ashes, if they had have destroyed that on me, that would have been the end.”\nAnne says they came back four days later.\nAmong the jewellery stolen were wedding and engagement rings and a locket that her late husband had given her as a 25th anniversary present.\nAnne's says the community has shown her incredible support.\nBut all she wants is her precious jewellery - with all their memories - back with her.\n“If they’d give me my ring and my cross and chain back and my locket, they can keep the rest,” she said.\n“Money is no good, if they just give me back the sentimental stuff, I’d be as happy as the birds.”\nPlay video police Northern Ireland", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:44:15.865+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
