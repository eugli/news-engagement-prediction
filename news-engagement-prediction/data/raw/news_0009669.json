It'll take three to six weeks for him to recover,\" said Hendrawan. \n\"He's out of the All-England for sure. At this age, one of the big challenges is injury. We hope he'll recover,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T06:54:03.823+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
