Creating Our Own Reality \nThe Law of Attraction is one of the better known universal laws. The theory behind the Law of Attraction is that we create our own realities . Not only do we attract things we want, we also attract things we don't want. We attract the people in our lives, the stuff inside our homes, and the money in our bank accounts through our thoughts and feelings. \nWhen our beliefs are limited, we attract limited wealth. Maintaining a meager mindset will compromise a well-being. Otherwise, when we expand our mind with limitless possibilities those brick blocks begin to break down. Embrace believing anything is possible, the sky is the limit. In fact, you can break through that glass roof on the sky with your miraculous positive thoughts. Sadly, whenever we focus on the \"lack of\" we are creating a less-than reality. When we choose to monitor negative thoughts and switch our focus on being abundant and happy we will enjoy a luxurious and glorious reality. About The Secret \nThe Law of Attraction is not a new phenomenon, the theory behind its teachings has been around for ages. The release of the movie The Secret in 2006, based on Rhonda Byrne's book with the same name, created a media blitz that brought the teachings of the Law of Attraction to new heights, awakening thousands, if not millions, of people to this ancient truth. Many Law of Attraction teachers who were featured in the movie hit the talk show circuits promoting the movie and the law itself. Oprah, The Larry King Show, and Ellen were some of the talk shows that invited teachers who starred in the movie as their guests to talk about the cosmic universal law of attraction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:28:33.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
