Why, just this past Christmas, Kris Jenner gave Khloé Kardashian rare photos of Marilyn Monroe , Khloé gave boyfriend Tristan Thompson a diamond-crusted Patek Philippe watch and a Lorraine Schwartz bracelet — and Kylie Jenner gave Thunderbirds to her grandmother, M.J., and her mom . \nBut it’s not just the adult Kardashians who get in on the gifting action. The littlest members of the close-knit family are all about it too — just ask Chrissy Teigen ! \nOn Monday, the 31-year-old Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model showed off a new pair of Yeezys her 10-month-old daughter Luna received from Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West ‘s kids North , 3, and Saint , 1 — in honor of Valentine’s Day. \nThe present came with a sweet note addressed to Luna, that read, “Happy Valentine’s Day beautiful baby girl! Lots of love, North and Saint.” \n“Oh my gosh, Kim and Kanye — my baby is doper than me. My baby is cooler than me!,” Teigen gushed as she showed off the black kicks for the camera. \n“Look what you got?” she told Luna, as the sweet girl grabbed her new footwear. \nLuna appeared happy with her gift, smiling for the camera. But Teigen explained it had been a tough morning for her and husband John Legend ‘s daughter. “Maybe this will help today’s crankiness,” she wrote — telling Luna “Don’t be sad anymore! Don’t be sad!” \nIt looked to work, with Luna blowing kisses for the camera (with the help of one of Snapchat’s Valentine’s Day filters). after 3 months of trying to get her to blow kisses, she finally does it for the valentine's snap 💕💕💕💕 ahhhh pic.twitter.com/hR21tOOPfQ \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 13, 2017 \nLater on Twitter, Teigen explained that the Kardashians are the tops when it comes to giving presents. \n“NOBODY gifts better than this entire family,” she told a fan. “I swear, @krisjenner goes HAM.” @KimKardashian @erynwithnoi NOBODY gifts better than this entire family, I swear. @krisjenner goes HAM \n— christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) February 13, 2017 \nRELATED VIDEO: Chrissy Teigen’s Drunken Post-Grammys Snapchats Are Pure Hilarity (and Couple Goals!) \n“I don’t feel good,” she wrote on Twitter . \nIn a series of hilarious Snapchats taken late on Sunday night – following the Los Angeles ceremony during which Legend performed – the model appeared to be a little out of it, asking for an assist while attempting to remove her stunning jewelry. \n“Okay, I’m home. We’re having ramen,” she declared in the first video, showing off her silky, orange outfit change. \nBy the next update, though, Teigen was laying down. \n“I’m on the floor and John’s in charge of taking my jewelry off for [ stylist Monica Rose ]. Take it off John,” she said. Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T20:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:56:13.763+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
