She didn't do it when everyone thought she did. 02/06/2017 12:09 pm ET Cavan Sieczkowski Deputy Director, News & Analytics Tom Pennington via Getty Images Lady Gaga put on a stellar halftime show Sunday. \nLady Gaga’s roof jump at the Super Bowl was one of the most surprising moments of her halftime show, but apparently there was some Hollywood magic involved. \nOn Sunday night, after singing verses from “God Bless America” and “This Land Is Your Land” surrounded by drones, Gaga appeared to jump off the roof of Houston’s NRG Stadium from hundreds of feet in the air, suspended by only a few cables with a microphone in hand. Fox/NFL \nWhile the live broadcast made it look to people watching on TVs across the country as if Gaga had catapulted off the roof, TMZ revealed Monday that it was actually just a perfect illusion . Her jump was pre-recorded. A video posted by Jill Knipp Faucher (@jillyknipp) on Feb 5, 2017 at 5:16pm PST \nIntel spoke with USA Today about needing to pre-record the opening portion of the Super Bowl halftime show because of particular uncertainties, like rain or wind. \n“There’s a lot of weather and environment (issues),” general manager Natalie Cheung said. “In February, you don’t know what it will be like during Super Bowl Day. We’d hate to plan all this and, if the wind speeds are too high or if it’s raining and the roof is closed, no one can see this spectacular show. So our creative team, as well as the Super Bowl creative team, felt this would be best to be filmed. Lady Gaga also was on the roof when this was filmed, and from a logistics and creative perspective, it’s a bit hard for her to go from the roof all the way down to the floor of the stadium.” \nLive or not, Gaga deserves some serious credit for getting up there at all.
