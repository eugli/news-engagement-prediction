Brought in to serve mostly as a fourth outfielder, Bourn wound up playing all three positions and starting 10 games down the stretch. He batted leadoff in the American League Wild Card Game. \nâ€¢ Spring Training: Information | Tickets | Schedule | Gear \nBourn hit .264/.314/.371 with five home runs, 38 RBIs and 15 stolen bases in 113 games last season between the Orioles and D-backs. He earned two All-Star selections and two Gold Gloves earlier in his career as a member of the Astros. \nThe Orioles have four other non-roster invitee outfielders in camp: Chris Dickerson , Craig Gentry , Logan Schafer and David Washington . Joey Rickard , who played well in a bench role as a rookie last season, is expected to provide outfield depth at the Major League level as well. \nBourn is a career .266/.329/.357 hitter with 341 stolen bases over 11 seasons. is a reporter for MLB.com based in New York.
