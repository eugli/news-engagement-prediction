We know what they are fleeing from. We see it daily.\" Applications filled in without legal help doomed: lawyers \nAbout 11,000 people are waiting to apply and have been sent letters explaining that if they do not apply within two months their status resolution support service payments will be cut, Ms Jackson-Vaughan said. \n\"[It is] ultimately their bridging visa which then endangers their right to seek asylum [and] their right to work and health care,\" she said. \n\"We have young families with children in this situation who will end up starving and homeless . \nLawyers say most applicants do not speak English and if the applications are rushed or filled in without legal assistance they are doomed to fail. \n\"The forms are in English and require you to list everywhere you have ever lived and worked, why you fled your country and why you fear persecution. \nThese are legal definitions and hard to explain in your own language let alone [something other than] English,\" Ms Jackson-Vaughan said. \n\"Expecting people who have no legal background [and] are often traumatised and have memory deprivation[to do this] … it's unreasonable, and too challenging when it takes a lawyer 10 to 15 hours to assist one person.\" Decision detrimental to the already vulnerable: RACS \nRACS is calling for the Government to stop sending the letters and comply with its promise to give people the right to seek asylum and welfare payments.
