Before being sworn in as president last month, Trump attacked his successor’s ratings for the first episode of the show, tweeting: “Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got ‘swamped’ (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT.” \nDuring Thursday morning’s National Prayer Breakfast, an annual faith gathering of religious leaders and members of Congress, Trump returned to the theme: \nThey hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place. And we know how that turned out. The ratings went right down the tubes. It’s been a total disaster. And Mark [Burnett, the creator of Apprentice] will never, ever bet against Trump again. \nHe then called on religious leaders to pray. \n“I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings,” said the president. \nIn response, Schwarznegger took a dig at Trump in a Twitter video: \n“Hey Donald, I have a great idea. Why don’t we switch jobs? You take over TV, since you’re such an expert in ratings, and I’ll take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again,” he declared, raising his eyebrows at the camera. Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 2, 2017 \nWithin 30 minutes, Schwarzenegger’s post had 10,000 retweets. \nThe ratings of Celebrity Apprentice have dropped this year, down this week 16% in the 18-49 age demographic, a season low. \nAs a Republican governor of California from 2003 to 2011, Schwarzenegger focused much of his political career on increasing clean energy and climate change mitigation. \nBefore last year’s election, he said he would not vote for Trump , making it the first time he didn’t vote for a GOP candidate since becoming a US citizen in 1983 after he emigrated from Austria. \nThe former professional bodybuilder also publicly criticized Trump’s travel ban this week, calling it “vetted badly”. \n“To go and ban people who have a green card, that means that the United States of America has given you permission to work here permanently and you are on the way to permanent citizenship … I was in that position … It’s crazy, it’s crazy and makes us look stupid when the White House is ill-prepared to put this kind of executive order out there,” he told entertainment TV host Mario Lopez on Extra.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T19:52:23.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
