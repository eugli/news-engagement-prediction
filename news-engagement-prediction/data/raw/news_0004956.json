(Photo: Will Oliver, USA TODAY)\nSAN FRANCISCO — Bowing to growing pressure from customers and employees, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has stepped down from President Trump's economic advisory council.\n\"Earlier today I spoke briefly with the president about the immigration executive order and its issues for our community,” Kalanick wrote in an email to employees Thursday. \"I also let him know that I would not be able to participate on his economic council. Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that.\"\nThe about face comes amid a growing wave of criticism that Kalanick would continue to engage with Trump after the executive order banning refugees and others from seven Muslim-majority countries.\nThe backlash illustrated the difficult path ahead for technology executives in working with Trump in a bitterly divisive political climate. Protests were scheduled to take place at Uber offices around the country on Thursday.\nUSA TODAY\nReports: Tech giants working on letter opposing immigration ban\nAt an all-hands meeting last week, Kalanick told employees Uber was working with Trump to pursue its mission of improving transportation around the globe.\n\"We'll partner with anyone in the world as long they're about making transportation in cities better, creating job opportunities, making it easier to get around, getting pollution out of the air and traffic off the streets,\" Kalanick told employees in the meeting.\nUSA TODAY\n#DeleteUber? Trump ban stirs Lyft to ACLU donation as Uber takes heat\nThe day after Trump signed the executive order, protesters rushed to airports across the country to oppose it. Among those protesting were taxi drivers at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, who went on strike. Uber announced it would cut surge pricing at JFK, angering users who thought the company wanted to undercut the protests of taxi drivers. The hashtag #deleteuber surged in popularity, as customers cancelled their accounts in protest.\nKalanick was among several New York tech executives who signed a letter urging Trump to rescind the order.\nUSA TODAY\nUber has an immigration message if you #DeleteUber\nAn online petition sponsored by the Independent Drivers Guild, which represents nearly 50,000 Uber drivers in New York City, had called for Kalanick to resign from the advisory council, saying Uber was built on a \"foundation of hard work by immigrant workers.\"\n\"This is an important show of solidarity with the immigrant drivers who helped build Uber and number over 40,000 in New York City alone,\" Jim Conigliaro, Jr., founder of The Independent Drivers Guild, said in a statement. \"We are heartened that Uber has listened to the drivers and the community on this important issue that is so integral to the promise of the American dream.\"\nUSA TODAY\nMicrosoft, Uber, Apple, Google: How the tech world responded to Trump's immigration ban\nKalanick wrote in an email to employees, first reported by the New York Times, that \"Immigration and openness to refugees is an important part of our country’s success and quite honestly to Uber’s.\"\n\"We will fight for the rights of immigrants in our communities so that each of us can be who we are with optimism and hope for the future,\" he wrote.\nColor of Change, which mounted a campaign to push Kalanick to resign from the Trump council, says it's calling on the other executives to step down, too.\nRashad Robinson, executive director of the racial justice organization, said in a statement: \"Any CEO who stays on the council is placing access to power over people's lives, they are putting money over this country's future. In this moment in our nation, we will not forget those who remained silent and we will hold special contempt for those who used their access and power for profit.\"\n@travisk Not on President's Council any more?
