It didn't stay there. The truck tumbled off the highway, as seen in the video below: INCREDIBLE VIDEO: part of SB I-15 is washed away; fire engine tumbles off the side; fortunately no one hurt pic.twitter.com/5VMzQEBlqa — Rob McMillan (@abc7robmcmillan) February 18, 2017 \nNo one was hurt, McMillan said .
