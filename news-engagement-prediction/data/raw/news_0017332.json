The Bollywood star, who has fiercely guarded his baby girl against the glaring paparazzi flashes, might just be ready to introduce the toddler to the world. During a ‘Rangoon’ promotional outing, the new dad couldn’t stop gushing about his daughter apart from also talking about his film. When asked if he would release a picture of baby Misha anytime soon, the actor proudly announced that it would only be a matter of time. With a beaming smile on his face, Shahid said, “I will share Misha’s picture very soon. I think I will do it this month, or on my birthday. I am just waiting for a special moment to do it, but I will do it soon.” He went on to add, “Introducing her to the paparazzi is slightly odd but I will put a picture of hers out. In any case, we are happy to share her (picture) with everyone. Just that no such occasion has happened. So now maybe we’ll do it soon.” Apart from waiting for the release of his war-drama ‘Rangoon’, Shahid is also shooting for Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s ‘Padmavati’, where he will be seen essaying the role of Raja Rawal Ratan Singh.
