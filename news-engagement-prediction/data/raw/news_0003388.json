McDonogh 35 Rivals250 safety Brad Stewart committed to the Florida Gator while in town for his official visit. The four-star rated prospect had been a heavy lean to the Gators for quite some time, and was going to hold off a little bit longer, wanting to wait until Signing Day to announce where he would be going to college.\nHowever, after spending more time on campus, Stewart could wait no longer, and pulled the trigger Saturday evening.\n“I love the way my visit was set up, I give it a 10 out of 10,” said Stewart. “The first two times I went there I fell in love with it. This third time, it just sealed the deal with me so I made it official. I was going to wait until Signing Day, but Florida was where I wanted to be so I figured what is the point of waiting? So I decided to commit right there. The coaches were pretty hype when I told them the good news, it was just a good moment.”\nThe Gators have been in heavy pursuit of Stewart since extending him an offer back in the spring. Since then he’s gotten a chance to build a relationship with multiple coaches on the staff, seeing them almost like members of his family.\n“The consistency with Coach Skip [Tim Skipper] Coach Mac [Jim McElwain] and Coach [Torrian] Gray, we have been talking for a while and I could always tell how bad they wanted me. We always communicated every time we had the chance, so I know that was the spot for me. Coach Mac is like that with his recruiters where he tells then to stay in constant contact with players so the bond gets better, and that is what happened.”\nThough Rivals lists him as a safety, the Gators see Stewart being versatile enough to play multiple spots in the secondary. While on campus the staff showed him much more in-depth how he fits into their defense.\n“We hit the film room on the visit and the showed me close up how I can fit in the defense,” said Stewart. “They think I am a guy that can play multiple positions in the secondary and really make an impact. They see me playing a little corner and a little safety.”\nWhen asked about his highlight of the visit, the 6-foot, 194-pounder stated it was his time around the current players on Florida’s roster, most notably his player host Jeawon Taylor .\n“It was eye opening to hear what he had to say and he even told me about the scheme they run and what the players are trying to build at UF. Really he said I would be a bit piece for them and how Florida has a big chance for me to play early. We got to hang out and I enjoyed my time around him.”\nBrad Stewart Edit", "external_links": ["https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/nyuovx2nsjxp7s28v1ve", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/nyuovx2nsjxp7s28v1ve)"], "published": "2017-01-31T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T17:50:14.059+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
