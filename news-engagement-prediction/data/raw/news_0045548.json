Colbert replayed a clip of Trump suggesting that something tragic happened in Sweden the night before the president held a rally in Florida. \n“You look at what’s happening in Germany ,” Trump said. “You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden!” \n“No one,” Colbert said. “No one would believe that. Well, not no one, but maybe someone who skips their intelligence briefings.” \nWatch the entire monologue in the clip above.
