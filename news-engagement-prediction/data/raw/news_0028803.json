NEW: Senate confirms nomination of Steven Mnuchin to be treasury secretary, 53 yeas to 47 nays https://t.co/Okz2bwUl4f pic.twitter.com/UQsvFb5F52 — CBS News (@CBSNews) February 14, 2017 \nH e worked there for 17 years, including working with mortgage backed securities in the mid-1990s, where he rose to the role of vice chairman of the division. \nMr Mnuchin also worked with the man who broke the Bank of England . \nBillionaire George Soros hired him in 2003 to start a new business focused on buying risky debt. \nSFM Capital Management, Mr Soros's business, was seen by many as Mr Mnuchin's move from banking to the hedge fund industry. \nBut Mr Mnuchin wouldn't have been Mr Trump's preferred candidate if he didn't bring with him at least a bit of glamour. \nIn 2004, backed by Mr Soros, Mr Mnuchin founded Dune Capital Management with two former Goldman colleagues. \nThe company quickly expanded into the entertainment business, partnering with 21st Century Fox to back Avatar, one of the highest grossing films in history. Bradley Cooper stars in the Mnuchin-backed film, American Sniper Credit: AP \nM r Mnuchin now counts Suicide Squad, American Sniper and even Magic Mike XXL among his producer credits after forming RatPac Entertainment, which merged with Dune a few years ago to become RatPac-Dune Entertainment. \nAlso rather like Mr Trump - who has flirted with different political parties before settling with the Republicans - Mr Mnuchin and his family have aligned themselves more with the Democrats than Republicans in the past. \nHe has donated to Hillary Clinton's past campaigns, according to electoral commission records, including the maximum $2,300 to her presidential primary bid in 2007. He later backed Barack Obama's bid. \nThe Treasury Secretary has also donated to campaigns run by John Edwards, John Kerry and Al Gore, according to Dow Jones. \nRecords show Mitt Romney is the only Republican presidential candidate Mr Mnuchin has ever donated to, although in an interview with Dow Jones, he said that \"for as long as I can remember voting,\" he has been a registered Republican. \n\"He has experience managing large and complicated private-sector enterprises and in negotiating difficult compromises and making tough decisions - and being accountable for those decisions,\" said Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Finance Committee after he was confirmed. Mnuchin pictured with fiancee Louise Linton Credit: Rex \nM r Trump appointed Mr Mnuchin as his national finance chairman last year, where he helped to cultivate a network of small donors that helped the then presidential candidate compete with Mrs Clinton. \nMr Mnuchin is following in the footsteps of fellow Goldman bankers Hank Paulson, who served under George W. Bush, and Robert Rubin, who served under Bill Clinton. \nBut New York-born Mr Mnuchin has had to use all his Hollywood hardball negotiating skills to secure his role in the cabinet. \nHis nomination was savaged by Democrats after it emerged he failed to declare more than $100 million of financial assets. \nHe did not disclose $95 million worth of property - houses in New York City, the Hamptons, Los Angeles and Mexico. He also initially failed to disclose that he is the director of Dune Capital International, an investment fund incorporated in the Cayman Islands, along with management posts in seven other investment funds.

Americans who claim they were forced out of their homes as a result of Mr Mnuchin’s mortgage dealings demanded to be heard at his hearing; 23 senate Democrats wrote to demand outside witnesses at the hearing, saying Mr Mnuchin's bank, OneWest, carried out 36,000 foreclosures forcing people from their homes. \nAmong those upon whom OneWest foreclosed were an elderly California couple tossed from their home of 50 years despite qualifying for a government-assisted loan modification, and a 90-year-old Florida woman who had a payment error that led to a 27-cent shortfall on her mortgage, the letter said. \nMr Mnuchin and his team sold OneWest in 2015, reaping around $1.5 billion in profits, the letter said. “His bank’s treatment of families seeking to avoid foreclosure is critical to assessing his fitness to serve as the nation’s top economic policy official,” they wrote.
