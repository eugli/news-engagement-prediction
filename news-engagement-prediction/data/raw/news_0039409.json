(25:31) The US president's naive comment on the two or one-state solution - saying he \"can live with either one\" - means Washington is likely to prolong the status quo of occupation. \nEver since the 1967 occupation, the United Nations Security Council has repeatedly expressed the illegality of the occupation, as in the preamble of Resolution 242 \"emphasising inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war\". ( PDF ) \nBy leaving the solution to the parties while, at the same time, politically bypassing the Palestinian leadership, the Trump administration is empowering the Israelis to dictate to the Palestinians any deal they want. \nThe sheer reality of the Israeli occupation and the absence of any political solution is a reflection of how Israel's current tactics have not been producing any results for decades now. \nThe problem is that Trump and Netanyahu's warm relationship and the former's withdrawal of support for the two-state solution further weakens the US' ability be an honest broker. \nHoping that Arab leaders will replace Palestinians and agree to make peace with Israel on behalf of Palestinians, is another mistaken proposal. As the saying goes, \"been there, tried that\". \nIn the past, Arab leaders as well as Israeli and US leaders have tried to find an alternative leadership for Palestinians and have failed miserably. \nFor instance, Egypt and Jordan resisted pressures from Israel and the international community on who should represent the Palestinians in the 1970s, and i n 1974 the Arab summit recognised the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. \nNetanyahu and Trump's approach to the issue is pushing the region towards a more blatant and legalised form of apartheid in which the Palestinian majority in the occupied territories is stripped off their political rights while Jewish settlers enjoy full political and national rights.\n\nAfter the 1967 occupation, Israel tried and failed to bypass the PLO by turning a blind eye to Islamic charities established by Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, and as a result Hamas was born in Gaza. \nA similar attempt to undermine the Palestinian leadership took place in the 1980s in rural West Bank with the creation of an alternative to the PLO called the \"Village Leagues\". This Israeli effort to alter the Palestinian leadership by appointing Palestinian collaborators also failed miserably. \nThe last time the US tried to bypass the Palestinians it backfired spectacularly. Former US President George HW Bush - working with Secretary of State James Baker - pushed non-PLO Palestinian leaders to represent their people within a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation during the 1991 peace conference in Madrid. In response Israeli and PLO officials reached a secret deal in Oslo without the knowledge of Washington in 1993. \n'Permanent apartheid' Netanyahu's conditions to accept a two-state solution expressed in the Bar Ilan speech in 2009 have now an added element which negates the idea of an independent Palestinian state. \nDropping the commitment to a two-state solution virtually means a permanent presence of Israeli troops within the entire Palestinian territory. \nUnless four million Palestinians become avid Zionists overnight, it is unlikely that they will accept and recognise a Jewish state while agreeing to live without the same political rights granted to Jews. \nNetanyahu and Trump's approach to the issue is pushing the region towards a more blatant and legalised form of apartheid in which the Palestinian majority in the occupied territories is stripped of their political rights while Jewish settlers enjoy full political and national rights. \nThe International Criminal Court describes this type of \"institutionalised discrimination\" as apartheid and sees it as a \"crime against humanity\". \nMoreover, the idea of a \"grand deal\" that includes Arab countries would similarly fail. Former US peace envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, Martin Indyk referred to the idea as an \"outside-in\" approach. \nOPINION: Israel - An inspiration for Trump \nIndyk's proposal includes the idea of President Trump convening the leaders of the four Arab countries, Jordan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, along with the Quartet, made up of the European Union, the US, the UN, Russia, to announce \"a set of agreed principles that would serve as the terms of reference to direct Israeli-Palestinian negotiation to achieve a two-state solution\".\nSuch a summit would certainly not produce the results that Netanyahu or Trump wants. The 2002 Arab peace plan is very clear that Arabs will only meet and normalise relations with Israel once Israel agrees to withdraw to the 1967 borders. \nThe Quartet - with the exception of US - would also reject Trump's casual idea of giving up on the two-state solution. \nIf Trump and Netanyahu's meetings are expected to produce a political breakthrough, they should bear one basic principle in mind: The art of a deal requires that the dealmaker is honest and neutral, and parties in the conflict recognise and involve with each other. \nIf what we saw in the White House press conference is an indication, this prerequisite doesn't exist in the current US administration. \nDaoud Kuttab, an award-winning Palestinian journalist, is a former Ferris professor of journalism at Princeton University. \nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera's editorial policy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T16:20:13.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
