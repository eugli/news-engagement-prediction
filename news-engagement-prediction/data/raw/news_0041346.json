(Photo courtesy of the Missouri University of Science and Technology) \nBELLERIVE • Lara Edwards’ class load doesn’t offer much opportunity for expression. \nSo, she fills her extra time with art. \nEdwards is a graduate student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, focused on biology. She is also a proud published artist. \nWhen an opportunity arrived last year to illustrate a children’s book written by someone in her hometown of Rolla, Mo., Edwards jumped at the chance. \n“Illustrated books were always part of my childhood,” she said. Edwards recalled her mother identifying authors and artists before diving into a new book. “It was always part of my art education.” \nA mutual friend connected Edwards with the author, Marilyn Frederick. The two shared connections to a local church where Edwards had painted several murals , yet they didn’t know each other. \nFor the better part of last summer and fall, Frederick, Edwards and their team at Steeple Publishing brought the story of Timmy to life in “The Very Happy Trash Truck .” Aside from the perks of a paid project, Edwards said the book gave her a significant amount of latitude for artistic decisions. \nEdwards commutes from Rolla to St. Louis twice a week for classes. The commute is less expensive than moving into a dorm. That gave her time at home some weekdays to work on the project while pursuing her master’s degree at UMSL. \n“I’ve wanted to do something like this since I could grip a paintbrush,” she said. “My favorite part of this whole process has been having the opportunity to meet a need by doing something that I love to do.” \nThe book is aimed at helping early readers boost language development. It features the work escapades of Timmy the trash truck. The book, published last year, is sold out on Amazon and Rolla bookstores and is going through a second printing. \nArt, to Edwards, is emotional. It gives her a creative space and outlet that she doesn’t get studying biology. \n“People go to the internet and the movies seeking out these emotionally stimulating experiences to kind of counteract the other things they’re doing with the rest of their time, and that’s the role art has always played in my life,” Edwards said. “I definitely wouldn’t be able to stay a sane scientist if I didn’t have art.” \nEdwards hopes to continue her art career while pursuing veterinary medicine after her master’s program is complete.
