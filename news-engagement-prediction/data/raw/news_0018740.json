Editor \nEver notice how our beloved media reports issues that affect Singapore? Always want to give it a good spin. Advertisement \nA few years back when the skies opened up, and Orchard Road faced the first of its flooding issues, the media reported it as ponding. Well, how can it be a flood if there were no homes washed away, or people getting lost in the flooding, unlike our neighbouring countries. Those are proper flood. Singapore, we call it ponding. \nMost recently, the plight of the homeless are getting the spotlight, as they are now more brazen and no longer hide away in Singapore's dark alleys and corners. Now the homeless can be found in shopping malls. Guess what? The media report to this group as the displaced. Displaced? \nCome on! Flooding is flooding, homeless is homeless. Stop this ponding and displaced nonsence! Stop watering down the reality of the situation \nGreg P \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
