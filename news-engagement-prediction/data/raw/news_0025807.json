So important!! — SmallAsDust (@miss_firedancer) February 13, 2017 \nThere are three types of skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which are known as non-melanoma skin cancer, and melanoma, which is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. \nAccording to the Cancer Council , two in three Australians will be diagnosed with skin cancer by the time they are 70, while close to half a million are treated each year. Non-melanoma skin cancer is more common in men, with almost double the incidence compared to women. \nFor more detailed information about skin cancer please phone Cancer Council 13 11 20 or talk to your GP.
