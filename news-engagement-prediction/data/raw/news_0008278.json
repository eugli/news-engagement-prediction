(ABC News: Sebastian Neuweiler) \nClub president, Peter Nelson, said shark hunters were putting large baits in the water and fishing \"about as close as you can get\" to the popular swimming beach. \n\"If they do it regularly then I suppose the sharks get to realise that there's free food in that area,\" he said. \n\"I would think that would tend to attract more sharks into that area.\" \nMr Nelson wrote to the City of Greater Geraldton (CGG) and proposed a potential ban on targeted shark fishing in the area. Seeking advice on the matter \nCGG Mayor Shane Van Styn said the city was gathering information on the matter. \n\"Clearly, pulling sharks up on town beach is not a desirable outcome and we'll look to see if any action is necessary,\" he said.

(ABC Open: Chris Lewis) \nMr Van Styn said there could be grounds to create a local law against deliberate shark fishing in the area but said it would be hard to police. \n\"If we had a local law that said there would be no shark fishing then we could act by way of infringement,\" he said. \n\"I don't know how you'd start to know if someone was actually fishing for a shark or fishing for a large mulloway; very similar techniques are used.\" \nMr Van Styn said he would be seeking more advice on the matter and consulting with stakeholders. Liberals promise shark barrier \nInterest in shark mitigation at the Mid West city had swelled in recent weeks, after WA's Premier Colin Barnett promised that Geraldton would receive a shark barrier if the Liberal government was re-elected in the upcoming state election. \nAt the time, Mr Barnett said the barrier would boost tourism. \nMr Van Styn is concerned that images posted on social media, of fishers posing with beached sharks on Geraldton's foreshore, could turn tourists away. \n\"I'm certainly not impressed by seeing pictures of tiger sharks being brought up near Surf Life Saving Club facilities,\" he said. \n\"I don't think it helps our tourism image at all.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T09:32:45.379+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
