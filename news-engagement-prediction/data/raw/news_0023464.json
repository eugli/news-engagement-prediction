Watching this movie was fun — which is more than anyone can say for the first one — because Christian and Ana are having fun. They tease each other and giggle and go sailing; they seem to genuinely like each other. You as a viewer are free to sit back, relax, and enjoy the sex scenes.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below It helps that the source material is better this time around: Christian is still jealous and possessive in the second book, but he’s at least trying to change and relinquish some control to Ana — a relief if, like me, you aren’t turned on by a big-screen depiction of a borderline abusive relationship (my synopsis of the first movie). It also helps that director James Foley took more liberties with his adaptation than his predecessor, Sam Taylor-Johnson. (Perhaps he’s a more adept E. L. James whisperer.) Christian isn’t as unhinged in the movie as he is in the book (he doesn’t go over Ana’s head to cancel her New York trip, for example); Ana isn’t as annoyingly insecure (Dakota Johnson expertly plays up her independent streak); and the dialogue isn't ripped directly from E. L.'s text, meaning Christian sounds less like a sociopath.\nThe first sex scene comes after Christian and Ana, newly back together, go grocery shopping and make dinner. (Christian can't cut a pepper for shit and, unlike when other men can't cut a pepper for shit, it's actually cute.) The sex (or \"kinky fuckery\") starts with Christian going down on Ana while she's standing up — he has skills — and ends with them in missionary position. It's vanilla, especially for Christian, but even the kinkiest fuck can agree it's hotter to watch than that slow-mo flogger scene from the first movie.\nThat's not to say the sequel is without any kink: the Ben Wa balls make a spectacular appearance ; there's a spanking scene set to Nick Jonas and Nicki Minaj's \"Bom Bidi Bom\" that will make you want to find a man who can (consensually) slap that ass to the beat; and, oh my god, the spreader sex. I was not expecting it to make the cut, but now that it has: someone get me a shower-curtain rod, two coozies, and some duct tape, because I'm about to DIY this thing. There's also the much-anticipated elevator scene , which wasn't as titillating as I expected it to be but must be acknowledged for its creative demonstration of foreplay.\nDespite its title, Fifty Shades Darker is happier than the first movie, which hammered home the fact that Christian wanted Ana's formal consent to be his submissive but never sold you on the idea that his lifestyle was truly what Ana desired — because it wasn't. You sensed that as a viewer, and not even a quick glimpse of Christian's shaft could make you feel good watching him \"take\" Ana. Darker doesn't leave you with the same bad taste in your mouth, and although that doesn't necessarily translate into an arousing viewing experience, it does translate into an exciting one. You'll leave the theater just as Ana leaves Christian's Red Room: thrilled and wanting more.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T11:33:31.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
