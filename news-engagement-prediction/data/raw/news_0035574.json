However, this might be to a default when it comes to Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather. Appearing on “ The Jake Brown Show ” on Thursday, Foreman referred to McGregor as the other guy and said he should take the publicity to make more money. \n“The other guy, no one even knew his name and now he keeps flirting with the idea of him fighting Floyd Mayweather,” Foreman said. “He should take advantage of that and go out and fight 100 more people and wait until the Mayweather fight happens. He’s famous now. He’s almost a household name and he was not until the talk of him fighting Mayweather. It doesn’t even have to happen.” \nWhile that is pretty solid advice, it’s solid advice for anybody in UFC not named Conor McGregor. As Foreman himself noted during the interview, MMA is here to stay. McGregor has helped make that possible with his brash attitude and antics, bringing in more average fans than would have been watching the sport. \nHe is a household name. If McGregor were to take 100 fights and wait, that money total probably still wouldn’t match what he could get for a fight with Mayweather. So while Foreman’s thought is understandable, it should still come with a grain of salt.
