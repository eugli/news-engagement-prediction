He was eventually winched down 80ft from the bell tower to the church floor on a spinal board by firefighters who had to open several trapdoors and use a rope system during the Evensong service. He was taken to Worcestershire royal hospital where he was treated for a cut to his head and back pain.\nA mechanic by profession, Mr Bowman is still able to walk and speaking from his home in Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Devon, he said: “We were raising the tenor bell, which takes two people, and the rope caught my heel. “It pulled me up in the air and I came crashing down on the floor with a big bang.”\nPictures of the rescue were posted on Twitter by the fire crew, which included a specialist rope team, who Bowman thanked as well as the paramedics who attended to him.\nGrant Wills (@HWFireGCWills) Technical and challenging job to rescue one male from bell tower, professional crews a credit to the community they serve pic.twitter.com/vEOxNuUnWk \nFebruary 11, 2017 Bowman said his injury was “pretty painful”, adding: “It was just an accident – these things do happen sometimes in life.” He said: “There were 20 of us there ringing. The rope went round my ankle and it took me from standing to upside down in seconds. It just flicked me upside down – that’s what did the damage.” \nThe Devonian ringers had travelled to Worcester to ring for the hour-long service, which started at about 4.30pm.\nThe cathedral’s bell tower contains 16 bells, including a bourdon bell, which together weighs in at 16 tonnes – the fifth heaviest ring in the world.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:03:57.963+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
