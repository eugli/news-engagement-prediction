If one person wants to watch it the app requires the other party to “grant a playback” by entering the secret key. Each permission is valid for only one playback. \nThe company website states that once the video is deleted from one device the steamy footage is “as good as gone” , reassuring users that the content “is never stored on or sent to our servers.” — rumukiapp (@rumukiapp) February 14, 2017 \nRumuki can be used anonymously, without providing an email account but an internet connection is needed when setting up the app and accessing playbacks. It is not necessary to be connected to the internet during the recording or syncing process, however. \nThe New Zealand based company also claims that your kinky data is safe from hackers as videos are never sent across the internet. \n“It is impossible for third party attackers to gain access to your videos without local access to the network your devices are on (that includes us!).” \nFrom another perspective, however, if you accidentally delete your personal re-enactment of ‘Fifty Shades of Grey’ then it’s “impossible” to retrieve, the company warns. \nA whitepaper has also been released to the public, giving a detailed security review of the tech. \nHowever, Rumuki advises erotic users that technology can only go so far in protecting your privacy and reminds those wanting to spice up their sex lives that ultimately responsibility for the security of your data lies with the user.
