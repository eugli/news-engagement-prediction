Who is (or are) the last Jedi? Who are Rey’s parents? Does Luke actually speak in this one? Will he and Rey ever get off that rock in the middle of an ocean? \nTurns out that we’re not the only ones with questions. Last week, Josh Gad cornered Daisy Ridley on the set of Murder on the Orient Express, where they’re both filming, and he grilled her about the new title . An unamused Ridley stood stonefaced as he peppered her with questions, and despite Gad’s persistence, he didn’t get anywhere. \nThat, however, didn’t stop him from trying a second time. In a new video posted to Facebook, Gad apologizes to Ridley for ambushing her, before giving her some supposed script rewrites from Orient Express director Kenneth Branagh. The new script encourages Ridley to answer questions like “Who are Rey’s parents?” and “Is Finn paralyzed from the waist down?” \nUnsurprisingly, she doesn’t give him anything. (After working on Frozen and the upcoming Beauty and the Beast, Gad should know how seriously Disney takes secrecy.) Watch Gad’s unsuccessful attempts below. \nStar Wars: The Last Jedi will hit theaters on Dec. 15.
