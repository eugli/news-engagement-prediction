James Hausman is hit in head by glass door on cruise ship \nThis week, Hausman was awarded $21.5 million in damages by a U.S. District Court jury in Seattle, which is reportedly one of the largest verdicts issued by a Washington State federal court. \nAccording to his attorneys, Hausman, who owns a precious-metals shop in Springfield, Illinois, was able to finish his 280-day world cruise following the incident but he suffered several seizures after that. \nHolland America claimed Hausmen carelessly walked into the door and called the incident ‘anomalous’. \nBut Hausman’s attorney Rick Friedman brought up 16 other incidents where passengers were hit by a sliding glass door. \nFriedman said the door’s motion sensors were scheduled to open and close much faster than usual, claiming the cruise ship were worried more about air-conditioning costs than the safety of their passengers. \nHolland America has filed an appeal.
