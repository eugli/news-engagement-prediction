They don’t have the votes.” \nMs. Pelosi said Republicans have been “baying at the moon for seven years” about repealing the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, but have failed to put forward a substitute since taking power. \n“They’ve been baying at the moon that they had a better idea,” she said. “They’ve come up with nothing.” \nMs. Pelosi said Democrats don’t have a duty to work with Republicans on replacing the law unless the new plan meets certain standards. \n“If they come up with something that keeps lower costs, expanding coverage and increasing benefits, then we can have something to talk about,” the Democratic leader said. “But we haven’t seen anything to talk to them yet in any category.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T22:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T18:08:01.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
