Government forces and Russian-backed rebels have traded heavy fire in eastern Ukraine over the past few days, killing at least 19 people and injuring dozens more.\nThe surge in violence is threatening to overturn a two-year-old ceasefire that has been repeatedly broken by both sides, but helped minimize bloodshed.\nRead more: \nUkraine erupts with new violence between troops and pro-Russia rebels \n  7 Ukrainian troops killed in new clashes with Russia-backed rebels \nDefence Minister Harjit Sajjan is looking at ways to “improve” Canada’s military support to the country.\n“I’m looking at the options right now in terms of how we can improve our support, what changes that we need to make,” Sajjan said Wednesday.\n“But one thing is for sure, that Canada remains committed to Ukraine.”\nCanada sent about 200 troops to Ukraine in the summer of 2015 to help train government forces, but the mission is set to expire at the end of March.\nThe Ukrainian government has publicly asked Canada to extend the mission and while the Liberal government has been noncommittal, Sajjan’s comments suggest an ongoing Canadian military presence.\n“I’ve always said when we send troops, we want to make sure they have a meaningful impact” said Sajjan.\n“And we are having a meaningful impact in Ukraine.”\nThe minister says Canada is steadfast in its support for Ukraine, and that Canadian troops are making a difference in the country.\nThe freezing residents of an eastern Ukraine town battered by an upsurge in fighting between government troops and Russia-backed rebels flocked to a humanitarian aid centre Wednesday to receive food and warmth.\nHeavy fighting around government-held Avdiivka, just north of the rebel-stronghold city of Donetsk, began over the weekend and persisted into early Wednesday. Donetsk city also was hit.\nAt least 10 people have been killed since Monday and dozens wounded.\nThe Ukrainian government and the rebels have blamed each other for the eruption of hostilities, the worst in months. Both sides have moved heavy artillery, rockets and tanks close to the front line in clear violation of a peace deal struck two years ago.\nAn urgent meeting of the so-called Contact Group, which brings together representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the rebels along with the Organization for the Security and Co-operation in Europe, ended Wednesday in Minsk, Belarus. The group called for the opposing sides to cease fire and urged them to pull back their heavy weapons by the end of the week.\nSeparatist rebels have been fighting government troops and volunteer brigades in eastern Ukraine since April 2014 in clashes that have killed more than 9,700 people. The peace deal signed in February 2015 called for a ceasefire, for heavy weapons to be pulled back from the front lines and for a political resolution of the conflict. The agreement has been observed only fitfully and skirmishes and artillery fire have persisted.\nWhat sparked the recent escalation is unclear, although Ukraine’s military has acknowledged that its troops have gained some ground around Avdiivka.\nThe fighting has caused power outages a midst a strong cold snap, with temperatures in Avdiivka as low as minus 18 Celsius (0 Fahrenheit). Hundreds of city residents streamed to a stadium where aid agencies distributed food, and to warming stations.\nEach warring party could find negotiation benefits in the resumption of hostilities.\nThe Ukrainian government, concerned that the new U.S. administration might take a comparatively soft line on Russia, could point to the escalation as evidence that Russia cannot be trusted.\nThat prospect was acknowledged by President Vladimir Putin’s foreign affairs adviser Yuri Ushakov. “Kyiv is trying to use the fighting it provoked itself as a pretext to refuse to observe the Minsk agreement and blame Russia,” he told reporters Wednesday.\nBut by showing the strength of the rebels and their Russian backers, the fighting could send a signal to Washington that Moscow holds power in the region and the United States should offer concessions if it wants peace in Ukraine.\nThe escalation “seems to be another reason for the soonest possible resumption of dialogue and co-operation between Russia and America,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\nIn Donetsk, local residents reported incessant outgoing and incoming artillery salvos heard throughout the night and in the morning, an intensity that the city has not seen in months.\nAn Associated Press reporter outside Avdiivka saw a Grad rocket launcher with empty rounds drive away from the front line Wednesday. Grad is among the heavy weaponry that both warring parties committed to pull back when they signed the 2015 ceasefire agreement.\nOn another side, an Associated Press reporter saw rebel artillery positions in the centre of Donetsk on Wednesday.\nIn the late morning Wednesday, shelling subsided; there were unconfirmed reports the sides had agreed to a ceasefire to restore electricity and water supplies.\nThe Ukrainian government’s press office for the military operation in the east reported one soldier killed, and nine soldiers and one civilian injured late Tuesday.\nIn Makiivka, the rebel-controlled northeastern suburb of Donetsk, two coal miners were injured Wednesday morning by shelling as they walked to work, the rebels’ Donetsk News Agency reported.\nWith files from The Canadian Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:09:15.293+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
