Slot to Kentucky Links (Photo: Michael Huang, 247Sports) \nPro Football Focus named Kentucky sophomore running back Benny Snell among its top returning players in the SEC. \nSnell checked in at No. 9: \nThe Kentucky Wildcats were the surprise package in the SEC this past season, and their offense was powered by a strong running game. Stanley Williams is off to the NFL, but Benjamin Snell Jr. is still there, and coming off a huge season himself. On 185 carries in 2016, Snell forced 44 missed tackles, and averaged 4.1 yards after contact per carry. After splitting time with Williams last year, Snell should see the bulk of carries in 2017, and is a sneaky candidate to push the 2,000-yard mark if that holds true and he can perform at the level he did in 2016. \nThe Columbus native burst onto the scene as a true freshman this past season. He accumulated 1,091 yards and 13 touchdowns on 186 carries. Las Vegas SuperBook releases updated odds for national title Start SlideShow \nHe was the only Kentucky player to make the list. He was also the only non-Georgia player from the SEC East. LSU, Georgia, Alabama and Arkansas each had two players on the list. The other spot belonged to Auburn offensive guard Braden Smith.
