TWITTER 2/10/2017 Will Arnett reprises his self-centered Caped Crusader in this busy CGI spin-off. \nWatching The Lego Batman Movie , the follow-up to the wildly entertaining The Lego Movie , is sort of like re-assembling the Lego Star Wars Ultimate Collector’s 5,197-piece Millennium Falcon: The achievement just doesn’t convey the sort of triumphant, giddy satisfaction that it did the first time. \nMaybe it also has something to do with the fact that Will Arnett’s hilariously egotistical Caped Crusader has been promoted from mightily effective scene-stealer to the role of all Batman, all the time — which can prove to be too much of a good thing. \nWhatever the reasons, although there is still much to enjoy here, this DC Comics-fueled Lego adventure fails to clear the creative bar so energetically raised by co-directors and writers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller back in 2014. Not that it will face any hurdles at the box office, with an all-ages-appropriate PG rating that should give the Warner Bros. release a solid run at the original’s $469-million worldwide haul. \nWith Lord and Miller otherwise occupied (they're currently directing the upcoming, untitled Han Solo Star Wars movie), the spin-off was trusted to Chris McKay, who served as animation director and editor on The Lego Movie, along with a whole bunch of screenwriters. \nThey immediately get down to the business of nailing the requisite tone, with Batman’s gravelly growl first manifesting itself over the opening production logos, offering amusing takes on the importance of starting with a black screen and dramatic musical cues. But the self-satisfied Dark Knight is starting to see that constantly dealing with The Joker (voiced by Zack Galifianakis) and his fellow fiendish rogues offers diminishing compensation for the fact that his solitary life on Wayne Island is getting pretty lonely. \nEncouraged by his faithful butler Alfred (Ralph Fiennes), he adopts the orphaned Dick Grayson (Michael Cera), while defending his track record against Gotham City’s new commissioner, Barbara Gordon (Rosario Dawson), who contends the lone vigilante approach is no longer getting the job done. \nWhile on the subject of teamwork, the writers, including novelist Seth Grahame-Smith ( Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ), Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers ( Community ) and Jared Stern & John Wittington (the upcoming Green Eggs and Ham animated Netflix series), find no shortage of satirical targets, taking sly aim at everything from Suicide Squad to Trump’s taxes. \nBut they and director McKay prove less adept at finding that terrific balance between the blissfully inspired and a non-syrupy sweetness that made the first brick-and-knob feature excursion so successful. \nInstead there’s an overriding, more-the-merrier philosophy that restlessly ventures beyond the DC universe, resulting in a frenetic pile-on that includes representatives from such Warner Bros. entities as The Wizard of Oz, Harry Potter and The Matrix. \nPerformance-wise, Arnett certainly gives it his disaffected all, as does his fellow voice cast of thousands, also including Jenny Slate as Harley Quinn, Channing Tatum as Superman, Conan O’Brien as The Riddler, Billy Dee Williams as Two-Face, Mariah Carey as Gotham’s Mayor McCaskill, Doug Benson as Bane and Apple’s Siri providing the calming tones of Batman’s trusty ‘Puter. \nAustralian animation company Animal Logic is again responsible for digitizing those millions of bricks, but this time the effect doesn’t seem to possess the same visual magic as before. \nLike the rest of The Lego Batman Movie , all the pieces are in place, but they just don’t have that same connective snap. \nProduction companies: Warner Animation Group, RatPac-Dune Entertainment, LEGO System A/S, Lin Pictures/Lord Miller/Vertigo Entertainment Cast: Will Arnett, Zach Galifianakis, Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson, Ralph Fiennes, Jenny Slate, Conan O'Brien, Doug Benson, Billy Dee Williams, Zoe Kravitz, Eddie Izzard, Seth Green, Jemaine Clement, Ellie Kemper, Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, Adam Devine, Hector Elizondo, Mariah Carey Director: Chris McKay Screenwriters: Seth Grahame-Smith, Chris McKenna & Erik Sommers, Jared Stern & John Whittington Producers: Dan Lin, Phil Lord, Christopher Miller, Roy Lee Executive producers: Jill Wilfert, Matthew Ashton, Will Allegra, Brad Lewis, Zareh Nalbandian, Steven Mnuchin Production designer: Grant Freckelton Editors: David Burrows, Matt Villa, John Venzon Composer: Lorne Balfe ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:24:56.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
