Srinivas Kuchibhotla died when suspect, named by police as 52-year-old Adam Purinton, walked into Austins Bar and Grill in the Kansas City suburb of Olathe and opened fire on Wednesday evening. Kuchibhotla's friend, Alok Madasani, and Ian Grillot, a bar-goer who tried to intervene in the attack, were also shot, but survived. Witnesses told local media they heard the suspect yell, \"Get out of my country.\" Police have not corroborated the statements but the FBI has joined the investigation to determine whether the shootings are hate crimes.

The incident started after the suspect became agitated at the bar, Grillot said. He said he defended the two Indian men and asked the suspect to leave. Witness Jeremy Luby said the man stumbled around the parking lot for a while, then got in a pickup and left. \"I thought all the trouble was over with, and we were all just sitting and watching the game minding our own business,\" Grillot told CNN affiliate KMBC-TV. But the suspect returned with a firearm and started shooting. Grillot was shot in the hand and chest as he tried to stop the gunman. Purinton has been charged with one count of premeditated first-degree murder and two counts of attempted premeditated first-degree murder.

But he feels that many in the community are beginning to question their future in the neighborhood. \"People have dreamed of settling down in Johnston County, they have the best schooling district,\" he said. \"Now are concerned about raising their kids here. People aren't jumping to conclusions but (are) wanting to be on their guard.\" Vigil On Sunday, Kansans, native-born and those who have settled in the state, stood with heads bowed in a vigil for the victim, according to local media. Madasani spoke at the event, sponsored by the India Association of Kansas City at the Ball Conference Center in Olathe. \"I wish it was a dream,\" he said, according to the Kansas City Star. \"What happened that night was a senseless crime and that took away my best friend.\" Madasani and Kuchibhotla, originally from India, worked at Garmin, the technology company that makes GPS devices. Sunayana Dumala, Kuchibhotla's widow, said she was constantly worried about violence against foreigners in the United States, but her husband had assured her everything would be OK. \"I told him many times, 'Should we think about going back? Should we think about going to a different country?' He said, 'No,' \" she told CNN affiliate KCTV-TV. Witness recalls moments before, after Olathe shooting Indian media: Questions over reaction to killing An opinion piece in the Hindustan Times, a leading Indian newspaper, questioned the disparity between the coverage of killings of white victims and those of other races, and asked why the incident was not a bigger media story in the US.

The sentiment was shared in the US. Kumail Nanjani, a Pakistani-American comic, tweeted: \"The President could say \"Don't shoot innocent brown people. It's wrong.\" And he would save lives.
