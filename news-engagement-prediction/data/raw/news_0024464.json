We are, however, predicting oil traces at various locations. It has to be validated on the ground now as it is difficult to get correct picture from the sky,” explained Balakrishnan Nair, Scientist & Head of the Ocean Science & Information Services Group (ISG), INCOIS. \nThe Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) spilled into the sea in the early hours of January 28 following the collision between two cargo ships m.v. MT Maple and m.v. MT Dwan at Kamarajar Port and after a request made by the Indian Coast Guard, INCOIS scientists here has pressed into service its trajectory model to predict the drift in ocean currents and has been monitoring ever since. \n‘Big spill to be calculated live’ \nThe model developed over four years and pressed into service last year helps in assessing and also predicting the extent of damage to coastlines. This was the first big oil spill it had to calculate live. \n“Most HFO has been beached already and we are sharing whatever information we have with the Coast Guard including traces left in the ocean,” said Satheesh C. Shenoi, Director INCOIS. \nScientists have calculated that oil spill could have affected 52 km of coastline near Muttukadu on Tuesday night. \nOn Monday night it had affected 45 km of coastline near Kavathur with an error of plus or minus three km. \nINCOIS scientists had earlier informed that since the precise extent of HFO spilled into the ocean was not clear, the trajectory models were worked for spill of about 20 tonnes to measure the drift. Earlier, it was estimated that 27 km to 29.52 km of coastline was affected depending on the amount of oil spill.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:39:03.739+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
