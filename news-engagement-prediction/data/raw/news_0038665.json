An event page noted that Shkreli will “play tracks from his unreleased music collection (Wu-Tang and more)” in addition to giving an hour-long lecture on “investing, healthcare and politics” followed by a Q&A session.

Following Trump’s election, he premiered samples from the album and claimed to be negotiating terms for a wider release. \nWatch Migos rate Martin Shkreli on “Over/Under”: Artists In This Story", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T03:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:18:55.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
