Last week two tents caught fire in a suspected arson attack in the graveyard of St John's Church.\nThe secluded campsite was provided by the vicar as a safe place for homeless people to sleep.\nOne young woman, who was inside one of the tents at the time, says she's too scared to go back. We've concealed her identity.\nPlay video The group were given emergency shelter by charity Signpost. But they say a more permanent solution to Cirencester's homeless problem is needed.\nWe spoke to Graham Harris, a co-ordinator at the charity, who discussed the affect attacks like these can have.\nPlay video Mr Harris said he wrote to Gloucestershire's Police and Crime Commissioner Martin Surl a week before last week's attack - making him aware that there had been a wave of attacks aimed at Cirencester's homeless community, and asking him to do something to help.\nPlay video Signpost provide three meals a week for the homeless in Cirencester - but say what's needed is a safe place to shelter, and more projects to help get people off the streets permanently.\nPlay video Last updated Tue 14 Feb 2017 Homeless Cirencester", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:29:42.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
