(EPA/Newscom) Reprints \nMarket history clearly shows that explosive earnings growth is a trait shared by virtually all of the best-performing stocks. And what drives that growth? Profit margins and return on equity. \nThe list below highlights stocks like Facebook ( FB ) and Alibaba ( BABA ) that have exceptional profit margins and a solid ROE. Both factors measure how well a company is run and how efficiently it uses capital. \nTo make the list, each stock has to have a 50% or higher annual pretax profit margin and a return on equity north of 17%, which is the average ROE for top-performing stocks in the early stages of a major price move. The stocks must also have a 90 or higher Composite Rating. Earnings Reports & Buy Zones \nAmong the companies that made the grade, Facebook, Alibaba, Phillips 66 Partners ( PSXP ) and BOFI Holdings ( BOFI ) have already reported Q4 numbers. \nBut self-driving-car technology provider Mobilieye ( MBLY ) and United Therapeutics ( UTHR ), which develops treatments for cardiovascular and infectious diseases, are still on deck. \nMobileye, which has a weak relative strength line but is near a potential buy point, reports Feb. 22. United Therapeutics, which is more than 25% beyond a 131.09 entry it cleared in November, reports the next day, on Feb. 23. \nFacebook and Mobileye also made IBD's recent list of today's fastest-growing companies , based on five-year annual EPS growth rates. Mobileye has shown 117% annual growth, topping Facebook, which saw its growth accelerate to 57% following its report for 2016 on Feb. 1. \nThe social media giant is still trading just within a 129.37-135.83 buy zone. \nAlso note that BOFI, a mostly online banking operation, made IBD's latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds , with 20 funds investing $23 million over the last three months.
