Actually, I think a lot of girls think it's new so they're kind of happy about it, I guess,\" he said. \nLuca agreed the girls in the squad appeared happy to have them involved. \n\"They just treat me like another person doing synchro, like anyone else,\" he said. \n\"I like it because it's a really creative sport and I'm a really creative person.\" 'Only a matter of time' before men allowed in Olympics \nSynchronised swimming and rhythmic gymnastics are currently the only Olympic disciplines solely for women. \nHowever, during the 2015 Synchronised Swimming World Championships in Kazan, Russia, mixed pairs were allowed to enter. \nCoach Marina Kholod, who represented Ukraine at the 2000 Sydney Olympics in synchronised swimming, said it was only a matter of time before men were allowed to compete in the sport at the Olympics. \nShe said it would be a change for the better. \n\"It would open so many possibilities with choreography,\" Ms Kholod said. \n\"The creative part would be completely open to create different stories, love stories, whatever you say as a duet for male and female. \n\"Male strength, physical strength is way greater than female and the ability of the lifts, powerful choreography comes into place.\" \nMs Kholod said she was training her junior squad in preparation for the 2024 Olympic Games. \n\"It's like a long-term investment because to raise a really good synchronised swimmer at an international level takes between seven to 10 years, considering that you have good material initially. \n\"So it comes down to simple math that if you want to be in 2024 you have to start now.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T11:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:08:50.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
