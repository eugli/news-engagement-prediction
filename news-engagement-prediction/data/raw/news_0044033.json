Allderdice wins thriller in three OTs, 71-70 February 20, 2017 12:00 AM Larry Roberts/Post-Gazette Allderdice's Jaghi Ogbonna lifts the City League championship trophy after beating Obama in triple overtime, 71-70. Larry Roberts/Post-Gazette Allderdice’s Tyler Williams, right, drives down the edge of the court while evading Obama’s Derek Gordon in the City League championship Sunday at Petersen Events Center. By Keith Barnes Tri-State Sports & News Service \nObama Academy guard Dana Strothers hit clutch shots in the closing seconds of regulation and the first overtime to extend the City League championship game against three-time defending champion Allderdice. \nNot to be outdone, the Dragons Jahi Ogbonna drained a runner in the lane with 1.5 seconds left in the second overtime to keep their hopes of winning a fourth consecutive title alive. \nIn the end, though, it wasn’t a last-second shot that decided a title game that featured 19 lead changes and eight ties. It was the same shot over and over again. \nAllderdice junior Tyler Williams made 5 of 6 free throws in the third overtime, including the back end of a two-shot foul with 19.8 seconds remaining as the Dragons hung on for a 71-70 victory at the Petersen Events Center for their fourth consecutive City League title. \n“My dad is the one who gave me my confidence [to] stay aggressive because there was times when it wasn’t going too well for me this season,” Williams said. “It was a lot to be sure. It was crazy, but you’ve got to have confidence.” \nWilliams’ consistency from the line in the fourth quarter and overtime — he made 9-of-10 overall and scored 11 of his 13 points down the stretch — might not have been the flashy reason why Allderdice won. But it was a contributing factor. \n“They played as hard as they could and did what we asked them to do and came up with clutch shot after clutch shot,” Obama Academy coach Devas Simmons said. “They had a young man make 9 of 10 free throws to keep them in the game. They just won it. We didn’t lose it.” \nWilliams’ consistency only came about as a byproduct of the dramatic plays from Strothers and Ogbonna that defined the game. \nAt the end of regulation, Allderdice (16-8) appeared have the game won when Jackson Blaufeld stepped back and ripped a straightaway 3-pointer to give the Dragons a 44-42 lead with 13 seconds remaining. Then Strothers coolly drifted over to the right corner and nailed a long-distance two-pointer at the buzzer to tie the game, 44-44, and send it to the first overtime. \nThis time, Tavonne Davis hit the back end of a two-shot foul to put Allderdice ahead, 56-53, with 7.0 seconds left. The Eagles responded quickly as Strothers pulled up on the fly at the top of the key and drained a 3-pointer that extended the game to a second extra period. \n“With shots like that, you don’t know if your kids are going to get deflated,” Allderdice coach Buddy Valinsky said. “It was some of the younger kids that stepped up and said, ‘We got this,’ and … Strothers, the 3-point shot, we knew he was going to shoot it, we set up our defense, our kid had him tough, and he still shot it and, great shot. It happens.” \nInstead of getting deflated, Allderdice took it as a challenge. Trailing 62-59, Ogbonna, who finished with 21, hit his second 3-pointer of the second overtime to tie the game with 32.9 seconds left. After Trez Jones hit two free throws, Ogbonna scooped a layup in with 1.5 seconds left to push the game to the third extra period. \n“To be honest, I just envisioned myself as the 2016 [NBA] champion [Cleveland] Cavaliers and thought of Kyrie [Irving] and I thought, if I was going to go out, I was going to go out shooting,” Ogbonna said. “Actually that was my mentality and, like my man Kyrie said, let it go.” \nEven at the end, Obama Academy (13-9) had an opportunity to win. Allderdice had a one-point lead with possession, but the Dragons turned the ball over with less than seven seconds left. \nOf course the ball went into Strothers hands, and it appeared for a moment that he had a third last-second shot left in him to add to his game-high 24 points. But the Dragons got back on defense and forced a turnover with 4.6 seconds left and sent the ball into the frontcourt to close it out. \n“He played big time, and that’s why I didn’t call timeout when we had the ball last because he went to go make a play and it didn’t work out,” Simmons said. “He has the heart of a lion and won’t let his team down and will never stop fighting.” \nBoth teams will move on to their respective PIAA tournament. Allderdice, a finalist in Class 4A a year ago, will play McDowell in the District 6-8-10 regional semifinals Friday at Carrick while Obama Academy will face the yet-to-be determined District 10 champion March 3 at Allderdice. Still, despite its predecessors, thist might have been the title they least expected.
