Editors Advertisement \nThere is a major fire now happening at the Tuas Waste Management plant. Apparently, the affected plant belongs to the ECO Special Waste Management. SCDF personnel are at the scene of the fore, battling hard to put it out. \nThe police had also advised the public to avoid the area. The fire, which occurred early this morning, is so huge, it can be seen from afar. \nHopefully, the fire can be put out soon. Kudos to our brave firefighters, may they be safe in their brave act in the line of duty. \nRam V \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
