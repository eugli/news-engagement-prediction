Director/writer duo Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer will direct a #StarWars parody under the title Star Worlds Episode XXXIVE=MC2: The Force Awakens The Last Jedi Who Went Rogue. Is nothing sacred anymore? Unsurprisingly the film will riff off the more recent adventures of the Skywalker clan and undoubtedly be littered with Jar Jar Binks cameos. 'Star Wars: A New Hope' [Credit: Disney] Not-So Epic Movies 'Epic Movie' [Credit: Regency Enterprises] \nFriedberg and Seltzer will surely be up copyright creek without a paddle when #Disney hears about this, but the duo are aiming to start shooting in late 2017 with a presumed 2018 release date. Known for their lackluster catalogue of films, which started with 1996's Spy Hard , there is seemingly no stopping the pair's relentless war against cinema. Todd Garner from Broken Road Productions will co-produce the film with Covert Media CEO Paul Hanson, while Covert will also finance the project. Hanson seems hopeful that the project can emulate the success of Scary Movie , rather than their more recent work: \n\"Jason and Aaron are a powerhouse duo who have proven time and time again that they are fully tapped into the what audiences love...Their fearless take on pop culture has us beyond thrilled to tackle the world’s most popular franchise with the two of them leading us into a galaxy far, far away.\" \nEveryone has time for Scary Movie; from Carmen Electra's bouncing bosoms to launching the career of Anna Faris, Scary Movie was a refreshing take on the horror genre and unique for its time. Sadly, the duo's work descended into lunacy more recently with the likes of Meet the Spartans , Disaster Movie and the 0% rated The Starving Games . Scary Movie is a rare diamond in the rough for the pair, but do they really have the credentials to take on one of cinema's best-loved franchises? It is surprising it has taken this long for the Scary Movie crew to hop on the Han Solo hype, but you can't help but feel that those kind of gross-out #comedy films have had their day. \nSee also: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T16:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:36:36.416+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
