If this happened it would be a disaster that would threaten the health and even the lives of the older people affected. It would also greatly intensify pressure on our hospitals.\n“Some older people and their families are already telling us that they simply cannot find any carers where they live, and we are also hearing of vulnerable older people receiving council-funded care whose help has been significantly reduced, leaving them to manage alone for many hours at a time.”\nThe charity says the government’s three ways of propping up the system – financial transfers from the NHS , a social care precept in local areas, and calling on families and friends to do more – are inadequate and cannot make up for a “chronic” shortfall of public funds. The report, published on Thursday, says the NHS can ill-afford to bail out social care, the amount the precept (an additional council tax charge) can raise does not match the needs in every area, particularly poorer ones, and the number of families and friends becoming carers is not keeping pace with a rising ageing population. \nShock figures show Tory plans are ‘making social care worse’ Read more \nIt concludes that the government’s strategy for keeping the social care system from falling apart is not up to scratch. The charity warns that the situation will only deteriorate further as rising demand is accompanied by budget cuts and more care home providers pulling out of the market. \nMargaret Willcox, president-elect of the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services , said the report “reflects the concerns of the whole sector united in the belief that adult social care is at risk of failure to chronic underfunding”. \nA government spokesman said it was making £7.6bn of new money available for adult social care: “This government has gone further to integrate health and social care than any other before it. We have brought budgets together for the first time through the Better Care Fund and given the NHS an extra £10bn per year by 2020/21 to fund its own plan to build a more responsive, modern health system.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:19:05.536+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
