So yes, we are not experiencing the best times, but there is reason to hope that we will see a better day.\"\nAsked to elaborate on those remarks during an appearance at George Washington University, Ginsburg responded with a twist on Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" slogan.\n\"I meant that we are not as mindful of what makes America great,\" Ginsburg said. One example is \"the right to speak one's mind.\" Another, she said, is \"the idea of our nation being receptive to all people, welcoming of all people.\" That includes \"the notion that in our nation we are many and yet we are one.\"\nGinsburg said that sentiment is reflected in the words inscribed at the base of the Statue of Liberty, which reads: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"\nShe did not mention Trump's controversial order temporarily banning all entry into the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority nations. The order sparked protests and was blocked in the courts. The White House says Trump will unveil a new order next week.\nGinsburg, who leads the high court's liberal wing, was openly critical of Trump in media interviews before his election. She later said she regretted her \"ill-advised\" comments in which she dismissed Trump as a \"faker\" who \"really has an ego.\"\nGinsburg told the BBC she is optimistic about the future and America's ability to change direction.\n\"When the pendulum swings too far in one direction it will go back,\" she said. \"Some terrible things have happened in the United States, but one can only hope that we learn from those bad things.\"\nShe noted the example of the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, calling it a \"dreadful mistake.\"\nAt her university appearance, Ginsburg had some kind words about Judge Neil Gorsuch , Trump's nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. Ginsburg said she got to know Gorsuch during a trip to England a few years ago to meet with judges there.\n\"I've worked with him and I think he's very easy to get along with,\" she said. \"He writes very well.\"", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:21:59.342+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
