(TVO)\nTVO will decommission eight over-the-air transmitters in Ottawa, Belleville, Chatham, Cloyne, Kitchener, London, Thunder Bay and Windsor.\nEight jobs will be eliminated as a result. Only TVO's transmitter in Toronto will be maintained in order to fulfil the requirements of its CRTC licence.\nAs a result, television viewers outside Toronto who rely on a free, over-the-air signal will no longer be able to tune into TVO for the first time since the broadcaster began operating in 1970.\nViewers who subscribe to cable or satellite TV will still be able to watch TVO. Individual programs will continue to be available online.\nTVO said the decision will affect less than one per cent of households in Ontario, but that's when access to programs online is taken into account.\nFor those who wish to actually sit down in front of their television rather than a digital device to watch TVO, the extent of the impact will be greater.\nIn a report issued last year, Toronto-based Convergence Research Group estimated the number of Canadian households without cable or satellite service was approximately 25 per cent.\nUh, @tvo isn't TVToronto, it's TVOntario!! As a Torontonian, I find this disturbing... Accessibility is important. https://t.co/ISgwcxpDGa\n— @PossibleArts\n@cbcallinaday I watch TVO in front of my TV, not my computer. I have no interest watching TVO on my computer screen.\n— @bmcmillan00\nMany rural homes don't have access to net of sufficient speed to stream content, let alone #TVO . Does this gov hate rural #Ontario #onpoli https://t.co/KJNzcnqLrc\n— @Kaputz77 'World is very different today' \"The world is very different today and people use many platforms to consume media,\" TVO Vice President Erika Kramer told Alan Neal on CBC Radio's All in a Day .\n\"We're evolving from a public educational broadcaster to a provider of many educational services on many platforms.\"\nAs examples, Kramer pointed to online educational games TVO has developed for Ontario students and the live streaming of its flagship current affairs program, The Agenda , on Twitter.\nTVO said shutting down its remaining over-the-air transmitters is in line with its shift towards providing 'many educational services on many platforms.' (TVO)\nKramer said the eight transmitters being decommissioned did not cover the entire province and that, in fact, TVO's over-the-air reach has been shrinking for years. In 2012 it shut down 114 analog transmitters, leaving many Ontario residents without over-the-air service since then.\nEven so, the decision to eliminate the remaining coverage is drawing criticism and raising concerns viewer support of TVO, which relies on donations, sponsorship and government funding, could decline.\n@lefthungry @cbcallinaday @tvo I am one with antenna. And I USED TO watch a lot of TVO. This makes me very angry!\n— @SandraDeeT\n@Mark_Goldberg @tvo Closing access to people who can’t afford cable/Internet.
