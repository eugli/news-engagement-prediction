If you thought Martha’s blind raw sushi taste test was peak “WTF”, wait until tonightâs episode where Martha’s mojitos and whole hog menu turn up the heat. \nFirst up is Martha’s pre-dinner cocktail. We all know Martha loves her spirits, so it’s no surprise that she’s got a killer mojito recipe up her sleeve that you’ll be slurping to the last drop. This simple yet irresistible cocktail calls for a few easy ingredients including superfine sugar, fresh limes and mint. Oh, and a few very generous ounces of rum. Give the ingredients a good grind, garnish it with a sugar cane stick for that authentic Cuban flair and you’ve got a real crowd pleaser on your hands! \nKelis ’s milkshakes may bring all the boys to the yard, but Martha’s classic mojito will certainly keep them coming back. Bottoms up! \nNow that the crew has had their dose of liquid courage, it’s time to get down and dirty with the hog roast. Before Martha’s precious pig goes into the fire, it’s injected with a traditional Cuban mojo marinade and dressed head to toe in an Adobo Criolla seasoning blend. The “slow and low” roast method creates the juiciest pork your taste buds will ever meet. Trust us – if you and a few friends have the cojones to get this hog on a spit at your next backyard feast, no other BBQ host will be able to trump you. \nIt takes some precision and a tad bit of elbow grease, but rest assured this little piggy will be the best you ever had.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:15:14.446+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
