So the car was completely burning and there was buckets of oil burning and some gas on the ground burning – but the flames weren’t escaping the building because there’s no hole in the roof, and it was all smoke coming out. The fire was just contained inside.” \nFire Prevention Officer Jack Burt estimated the damage at $100,000, but said the investigation is in its early stages and the total cannot be finalized until the building has been examined. \n“The garage itself was full of high-end electronics and a whole bunch of other items. So I think the loss would be significant,” Britton said. \nAlthough crews were able to get the blaze under control quickly, Britton said the location proved to be difficult. \n“There weren’t a lot of hydrants that we could access – the nearest one was on Wharncliffe Road,” he explained. “We would have had to do a relay. That’s why we were bringing in our tankers, and we were pumping from them. Our one pump ran out of water probably within the first five minutes.” \nBritton says since the property sits over a water well, the Ministry of Environment was called in to make sure gasoline and oil didn’t seep into the ground. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
