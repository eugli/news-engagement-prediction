I hope this movement will continue and spread for it has within itself the power to stand up to fascism, be victorious in the face of extremism and say no to oppressive political powers everywhere.” \nFarhadi, joined by London mayor Sadiq Khan and British director Mike Leigh, also said: “We are all citizens of the world, and I will endeavor to protect and spread this unity.” \nKhan organized the screening with actor and model Lily Cole, producer Kate Wilson and filmmaker Mark Donne to celebrate the British capital’s \"success as a creative hub and beacon for openness and diversity.\" \nThe Guardian quoted the London mayor as saying: \"President Trump can’t silence me. As I look around Trafalgar Square, I am proud and you should be proud, too, because here today we have men and women, old and young, rich and poor, Christians, Muslims, Jews, Sikhs, Hindus, Buddhists ... we have people from all around the world and the key message we send to the world is London is open.\" \nKhan also said \"we stand in solidarity with Asghar Farhadi\" and \"all those who are discriminated against because of their nationality, faith or background.\" \nFarhadi said last month that he would boycott the Oscars ceremony due to the travel ban for citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries, including Iran. Iranian-American engineer Anousheh Ansari and former director of Solar Systems Exploration at NASA Firouz Naderi will attend the Academy Awards in Farhadi's place.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:11:42.326+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
