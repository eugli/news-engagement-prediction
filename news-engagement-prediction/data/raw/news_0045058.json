(Sarina Locke: ABC Rural) \nHe met with South Australian Premier Jay Weatherill today to discuss the regulatory hurdles which he hoped could be removed by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). \nHe said they already had financial backing for the project which meant it could be in operation by next summer if restrictions were loosened. \n\"Our biggest hope is for reform of the arcane rules of the national electricity market which are standing in the way of a secure energy future; it's one of the most regulated sectors in the Australian economy,\" Professor Garnaut said. \n\"All electricity generators and users bid every five minutes for the price but then they average the price over half an hour. \n\"It makes life very difficult for a battery that can respond very quickly and it takes away some of the advantages of the battery.\" Hydro power station for SA's Upper Spencer Gulf \nEnergy Australia also received $450,000 from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) on Tuesday to develop a pumped hydro-power station in the Upper Spencer Gulf.
