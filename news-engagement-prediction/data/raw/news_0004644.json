Buzz60\nBacon prices are on the rise as supplies shrink, which is bad news to breakfast fans (Photo: Mark Rightmire, AP)\nThe country's bacon reserves are at the lowest levels in half a century.\nIn other words, pig farmers can't keep up with the world's sizzling appetite for those fatty, smoky strips of sheer eating pleasure.\nThe Ohio Pork Council, a Columbus-based non-profit, reported Tuesday that demand for frozen pork belly, frequently made into bacon, is outpacing supply.\n“Today’s pig farmers are setting historic records by producing more pigs than ever,” said Rich Deaton, president of the organization. “Yet our reserves are still depleting.”\nThere are literally not enough little piggies going to market.\nIn December 2016, frozen pork belly inventory totaled 17.8 million pounds, the lowest level since 1957, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nAs a result, prices are on the rise. The council reports pork belly prices have increased 20 percent in January. Officials said increased foreign demand might account for the decline in inventory. Hog farmers export approximately 26 percent of total productions, the council said.\n“While bacon may become more expensive for consumers, rest assured pork industry will not run out of supply,” said Deaton.\nCLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed\nx Share\nTHE GUILTY PLEASURE OF BACON DIY: Caramel bacon popcorn | 0:42 With caramel sauce, roasted almonds, and crumbled bacon, not much can go wrong.
