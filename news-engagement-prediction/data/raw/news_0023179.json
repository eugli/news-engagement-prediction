Minister dismisses group as a 'front' \nMs Kelly said the Tasmanian Government needed to provide more funding for research into the endangered species. \n\"It's imperative [to get] independent government funding for research so the scientists don't feel pressure not to [speak out], because of the funding that they rely on from the salmon companies in the harbour,\" she said. \nEnvironment Minister Matthew Groom declined to say whether he was considering enforcing a DO threshold, but took aim at Environment Tasmania. \n\"Any future actions will be guided by this expert research, and not by green front groups such as Environment Tasmania,\" he said. \nMr Groom said research into the skate was ongoing, but declined to give detail. \nThe Commonwealth Department of Environment's website lists priority for the development of a recovery plan for the species as \"high\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:04:22.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
