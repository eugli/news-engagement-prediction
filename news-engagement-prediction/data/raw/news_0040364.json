It's not that I have a safe full of money and I roam with the key in my pocket,\" Nahid told the teachers. \n\"The government is run under the leadership of the honourable prime minister. I only try to do the duty I have been given,\" he added. \nAt the conference organised by Bangladesh College Teachers' Association (BCTA), the teachers also demanded the creation of new posts, regular payment of teachers under MPO (monthly payment order) programme, annual allowances and bonus. At the beginning of his speech, the education minister said he came to hear and learn from the teachers.\nWhen the teachers started to chant the slogans halfway through his speech, he reacted sharply to their action. \"Today I have learnt from you that we should shout during speech and teachers do listen to what the others say,\" he said \nHe claimed the government already took decision to meet the demands, including creation of the posts of professors, associate professors in private colleges. \n\"But it's not that we can implement decisions because other ministries approvals will also be needed. Only chanting slogans won't work,\" Nahid said. \nHe also advised the teachers to present their demands properly in discussions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T16:56:38.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
