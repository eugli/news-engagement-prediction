The legal document, filed in New York yesterday after earlier being rejected in Maryland , alleges that the Daily Mail story (which included claims from a Slovenian magazine report, and was eventually retracted) has hurt Mrs. Trump’s “brand, and licensing, marketing, and endorsement opportunities” to the tune of “multiple millions of dollars.” The suit argues that Melania had “the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an extremely famous and well-known person . . . to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world.” The potential brand empire sounds in the vein of her stepdaughter Ivanka’s: According to the filing, it “would have included, among other things, apparel, accessories, shoes, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care, skin care, and fragrance.” In the wake of the Mail report, however, Trump argues that her “brand has lost significant value, and major business opportunities that were otherwise available to her have been lost.” The lawsuit, filed by Charles Harder, the same attorney who represented Hulk Hogan in his Peter Thiel–backed $140 million invasion of privacy judgment against Gawker —does little to quiet fears that the Trump family plans to use the presidency for financial gain. But, based on recent developments, it may also overestimate the value of the Trump brand: This week Nordstrom dropped Ivanka’s eponymous line , and Neiman Marcus stopped carrying her jewelry collection.
