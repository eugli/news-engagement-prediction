It’s actually the Swedish word for indispensable.\nIKEA uses a database of Swedish words to assign each new item a name that conforms to their key - so bedding is named after flowers and plants,\nIKEA's secret taxonomy revealed\nBathroom articles: Names of Swedish lakes, watercourses\nBed textiles: Flowers and plants\nBeds, wardrobes, hall furniture: Norwegian place-names\nBookcases: Professions, Scandinavian boys' names\nBowls, vases, candle and candle holders: Swedish place-names, descriptive words, spices, herbs, fruits and berries\nBoxes, wall decoration, pictures and frames, clocks: Swedish slang expressions, Swedish place-names\nChildren’s products: Mammals, birds, descriptive words\nDesks, chairs and swivel chairs: Scandinavian boys' names\nFabrics, curtains: Scandinavian girls' names\nGarden furniture: Scandinavian islands\nKitchen accessories: Fishes, mushrooms and descriptive words, sometimes the product-uses\nKitchens: Usually product uses, sometimes Swedish slang expressions and Swedish place-names\nLighting: Measurement units, seasons, months, days, shipping and nautical terms, Swedish place-names\nRugs: Danish place names\nSofas, armchairs, chairs and dining-tables: Swedish place names\nIKEA’s naming team uses a database of Swedish words to assign each new product a name that conforms to a specific key.\nThere are a few exceptions, like products that are named after what they do or creative names that designers can suggest for their products. But most of the time each new item goes along with the rules, created by IKEA’s founder Ingvar Kamprad and his sister, Quartz revealed.\nIn IKEA’s early days, it was just a family-run business and his sister was responsible for naming the products.\nThe two came up with the naming strategy – which is still used today across all IKEA’s international inventories – because Ingvar has dyslexia and struggled to remember all the numbers in item codes.\n‘It was very clever and very typical of Ingvar and how inventive he is as an individual to come up with this idea of naming the products because they relate to something that he would then be able to remember,’ Marty Marston, a public relations manager for IKEA, told DailyMail.com.\nShe added: ‘I find it really endearing and it’s kind of fun.’\nSome of the naming categories overlap, so all desks, chairs and swivel chairs are named after Scandinavian boys’ names and bookcases are named after professions and Scandinavian boys’ names, too.\nThen there are the Swedish places that name: bowls, wall decorations, pictures and frames, clocks (also named after Swedish slang); Couches, armchairs, chairs and dining tables; and Lighting products (also named after units of measurement, seasons, months, days and shipping and nautical terms).\nEven IKEA’s name has another meaning.\nIt’s an acronym standing for Ingvar, Kamprad, Elmtaryd and Agunnaryd. Ingvar Kamprad is the name of the founder, Elmtaryd was his family’s farm and Agunnaryd was the village where Kaprad grew up.\nSo next time you’re walking through IKEA’s showroom, marveling at the Glansnäva and Mjölkört curtains or picking up an Älvsbyn chandelier, remember these rules and you’ll at least know where your new chandelier’s name comes from (it’s a Swedish municipality).\nThe man in the know: IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad is dyslexic and struggled to remember the item codes for his company's products in the early days so his sister began naming items after places, flowers, waterways", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "https://qz.com/896146/how-ikea-names-its-products-the-curious-taxonomy-behind-billy-poang-malm-kallax-and-rens/"], "published": "2017-02-02T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:32:00.540+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
