The 28-year-old on Sunday showed just the perfect example why he's regarded as one of the best slip fielders. \nIt happened off the last ball of the ssnd over, bowled by Ravindra Jadeja to Soumya Sarkar. The Bangladeshi opener was in his elements, batting beautifully. \nBut a perfectly tossed up delivery from Jadeja forced Sarkar to played a defensive shot on front foot. \nUnluckily for him, the ball took a faint edge and ended up offering a catch at first slip, where Rahane completed the rite. \nHere's the video: \nInterestingly, it was a mirror image of how Jadeja-Rahane combined to dismiss England batsman Joe Root in Mohali in the third Test match. \nWATCH that catch HERE \nOn the penultimate day, India bowled out Bangladesh for 388 in their first innings, then declared their second innings 159/4. \nChasing 458 for a unlikely win, Bangladesh were 103/3 at Day 4 stumps. \nThey need 356 runs more to win their greatest match, and India need another seven wickets, for yet another win.
