North News and Pictures Maribel Milligan was found guilty of deliberately claiming more than £500,000 of tax payer money North News and Pictures 5 The 53-year-old was seen dancing at a wedding despite claiming she was heavily disabled \nTeesside Crown Court heard the 53-year-old lived a “lavish” lifestyle, with prosecution pictures showing her outside the Eiffel Tower and dancing at a glittering wedding ceremony, the Gazette reported. \nBut her “laughable” excuses for the deception were so far-fetched they sparked giggling from jurors during her week-long December trial. \nShe was criticised in court with Judge Howard Crowson saying she had tried to portray herself as the victim – despite evidence showing she even went riding a bike and swimming in the sea while claiming the benefits. North News and Pictures 5 Milligan faced court, with jurors laughing at the outlandish claims she had made \nShe even ran a massage parlour on the third floor of her home – requiring her to walk up steep stairs, despite claiming she could barely walk 20 metres before experiencing excruciating pain. \nJudge Howard Crowson said: “It was quite incredible to see you stepping swiftly from a chair and dancing with your husband. \n“You portrayed yourself at the trial as the victim – a person wronged.” \nHe said that she had organised a “sophisticated” fraud system, which even saw her blaming her carer at one stage. \nHer scam was only unearthed after a whistle-blower called the benefit fraud hotline – with a three year investigation discovering she had taken more than £539,000 from 2002 by claiming hardship and severe disability.
