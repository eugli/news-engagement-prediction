But local marketing traded on the film's Oscars buzz and romantic elements — and gettin the official green light from China's film regulators to open on Valentine's Day was particularly key. In recent years V-Day has emerge as a major movie-going date night, as young Chinese twosomes head to cinemas by the millions. La La Land 's title was translated into Chinese as \" 爱乐之城 \" or Aiyue Zhicheng , roughly meaning \"City for Music Lovers.\" \nChina Film Co. released the film, with Shanghai-based Baian Film and Beijing's Joy Pictures handling local marketing. Chazelle and star Ryan Gosling visited Beijing in late January to promote the movie. La La Land is Gosling's first film released in China, but co-star Emma Stone is a familiar face there, thanks to the Amazing Spider-Man franchise. \nEven more impressive than La La Land 's date-night debut, Vin Diesel's xXx: The Return of Xander Cage pulled in a massive $22.7 million on the holiday. After just five days on Chinese screens, the extreme sports thriller has earned $93.5 million and should cross the $100 million mark tomorrow. \nXander Cage co-stars Donnie Yen and Kris Wu, two of greater China's biggest celebrities. The film also is the first Paramount release since China's Shanghai Film Group and Huahua Media closed a $1 billion slate financing deal with the studio.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T18:38:33.285+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
