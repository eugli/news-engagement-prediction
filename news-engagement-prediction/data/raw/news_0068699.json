Thousands of people tramp through mud, bearing Russian flags and portraits of Boris Nemtsov, a bright and honest liberal politician, who had been shot dead two days earlier on a bridge by Red Square. It is March 1st 2015, but it feels like the start of a long winter. “Why did he take the bridge?” asks the little girl. “He was crossing the bridge on the way home, walking a bit in the evening. The view is nice from here,” her father explains. “But he did good things,” the little girl replies. “He did good things. We should not have let him get killed. We should have guarded him.” Doing the right thing in Russia can often get you killed. A balloon with a black ribbon flies up into the low, grey wintry sky. The camera cuts to Nemtsov at a railway station, flirting with Zosya Rodkevich, a 22-year-old anarchist and documentary-maker. She would film him for three years, not knowing that “My Friend Boris Nemtsov” would be his epitaph. “I saw the assignment as a challenge,” read the film’s opening words. “What could be interesting about an old, narcissistic bourgeois? He was 53…He had been deputy prime minister and the ‘heir of Boris Yeltsin’. But he turned out to be cool, kind and genuine. We became friends. And then he was killed.” Death changes the view of someone’s life. But Ms Rodkevich’s work, one of several new films on Nemtsov, is a close-up study of a living man—boastful, charismatic, sincere—and is devoid of gloss or consideration for history. Her camera inhabits his world, both physically and mentally. Occasionally he would ask: “Why are you filming this, silly?” But the camera keeps rolling, catching him, variously, asleep on a bunk bed in a train, stripping almost naked or talking about freedom and the perverse love of state power. Nemtsov climbs a bell tower under a blue winter sky (“Oh, I want to be the bell ringer. I will wake Russia right up”). He kisses women, talks to strangers, submerges himself in an ice-hole and gets bundled into a police van during Moscow street protests in 2012. The man in this film is not a saint, but a mortal—full of life, energy, pain and love for the country that once adored him, but was then taught to hate him. By 2015, after Russia’s annexation of Crimea, the Kremlin unleashed a wave of anti-liberal aggression that shocked Nemtsov. The former physicist who studied infrasound, laughingly explains to fellow opposition leaders: “Each person has his own resonant frequency. It depends on the size of the heart and body mass. If you strike the heart’s resonant frequency, you’ll have a heart attack and goodbye.” A hint of death runs through the film. In the penultimate scene, he boards a train back to Moscow from Yaroslavl where he won a seat on a local council, and hums an old Soviet tune: “Old motif of railroads, eternal youth of railway lines. It seems your whole life is ahead. Don’t go wrong when you are choosing your route.” The next shot is of Nemtsov in a coffin, his mother, wife and small daughter standing by his side. The director with the nose ring stares into the camera. In the last minute of the film, a funerary violin breaks into an energetic Soviet song that accompanies a kaleidoscope of photographs of Nemtsov’s political life. That minute is expanded in another film, “The Man Who Was Too Free”, made by Mikhail Fishman and Vera Krichevskaya for the second anniversary of Nemtsov’s death on February 27th. It is not so much a biography as a cardiogram of Russian political life over the past quarter of a century with all its seizures and spasms. The sound of a heartbeat runs through the film, until it flatlines at the end. It would take Nemtsov’s death to reveal the scale of Russia’s loss. At 32 he became Russia’s youngest regional boss, in charge of Nizhny Novgorod, which had served, a few years earlier, as a place of exile for another physicist and humanist, Andrei Sakharov. Nemtsov embodied the hope for an open, democratic and optimistic Russia. His only promise to his supporters was “not to lie”, which he never broke. The film is a montage of previously unseen footage and monologues by people who knew him well. It has no narrator, allowing for constantly gnawing questions about missed opportunities and historical alternatives. What if Nemtsov had not moved to Moscow as the first deputy prime minister? What if the oligarchs who controlled the media had not set out to destroy him out of greed and arrogance? What if he had become Russia’s president, as Yeltsin had originally wished? What if members of Yeltsin’s family hadn’t persuaded the ailing man to appoint Vladimir Putin as his successor? The contrast between the tall, generous Nemtsov and Mr Putin is so obvious that, at a preview, a sequence showing the Russian leader made the audience burst out laughing. But it was not just the Kremlin that came to fear Nemtsov. So, paradoxically, did those who considered him an ally. Mikhail Fridman, one of Russia’s richest men and a friend of Nemtsov’s, candidly admits that he stopped seeing him: “I realised that my relationship with him would be toxic for my business, my partners and my colleagues.” Whereas the Russian elite shunned Nemtsov for fear of upsetting the authorities, Alexei Navalny, an opposition politician who spent a night in prison with him, shunned him for his past links to the Kremlin. “I saw him as a man of the 1990s, a good man but one who brought political problems. I did not want him to support me during the Moscow mayoral elections.” At the end, Nemtsov, who was always surrounded by people, walks alone at night on a Moscow street. His voice comes as though from the other side: “People who fought for freedom in Russia were always in a minority. They moved the country forward, often at the cost of their lives…But I will come back! Don’t you worry.” This article appeared in the Books and arts section of the print edition under the headline \"A future that wasn’t\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:53:09.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
