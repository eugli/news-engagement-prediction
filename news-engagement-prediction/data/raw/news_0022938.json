I’m honored to be even considered for this.” Higbie says he has spoken with “a number of people” in interview rounds for the post. \nHigbie declined to confirm the claim that he had been interviewed for the position on Thursday. \nCNN reporter Dylan Byers says a White House spokesperson told him the story was completely false, adding that Higbie “hasn’t interviewed for anything. He spoke to a few people to say he’d like to help. That’s it.” \nHere’s Higbie’s background, from the Washingtonion: \nHigbie, a former Navy SEAL, is close with the Trump family, particularly Eric Trump, whom he met in the green room after appearing on the Kelly File last year. He was one of the first official surrogates for the president on the campaign trail. He was also spokesman for the Great America PAC, which purported to earmark donations “from the grassroots” for the Trump campaign. \nHigbie recently got into a heated debate on Twitter with Meghan McCain after he criticized Senator John McCain, her father, for slamming Trump for the Yemen raid many say was a failure. It is BIZARRE to watch a navy seal @CarlHigbie to say my father's service was dishonorable. BIZARRE. I am on Earth freaking 2. \n— Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) February 9, 2017 Trump has never served. My father can't bend one of his knees or lift one of his arms above his head. I am done with this today. DONE. \n— Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) February 9, 2017 Disagree with politics ANY single day but how dare anyone question the honor of my father and his service. \n— Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) February 9, 2017 . @CarlHigbie you said his record was bad because he crashed planes. I take great offense at what you said about his service. \n— Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) February 9, 2017 . @CarlHigbie Why can't you criticize his comments without criticizing his service?!? \n— Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) February 9, 2017 . @CarlHigbie please say that on television next time after you question his record for crashing a plane before being taken into a POW camp. \n— Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) February 9, 2017 \nHigbie had called McCain “dishonorable” for his comments on the Yemen raid where one U.S. military member died, the first under Trump’s term. After WH demands McCain apologize for criticizing US raid, Vet calls it “shameful” https://t.co/9X3jdKSx9Y \n— Brooke Baldwin (@BrookeBCNN) February 9, 2017 \nThere was also a report Monday that Trump was upset at the characterization of Spicer on Saturday Night Live, fueling the speculation that he might be let go soon. \nMore than being lampooned as a press secretary who makes up facts, it was Spicer’s portrayal by a woman that was most problematic in the president’s eyes, according to sources close to him. And the unflattering sendup by a female comedian was not considered helpful for Spicer’s longevity in the grueling, high-profile job, where he has struggled to strike the right balance between representing an administration that considers the media the “opposition party,” and developing a functional relationship with the press. \n“Trump doesn’t like his people to look weak,” added a top Trump donor. \nMeanwhile, Trump’s advisor Kellyanne Conway is also reported to have displeased Trump when she gave a “free commercial” for Ivanka’s clothing line, something widely considered illegal for a White House to do.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:16:20.075+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
