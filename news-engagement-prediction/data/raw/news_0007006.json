It's like a tougher version of us,\" he said. \n\"The first couple of days, we had high hopes,\" Mr Chou said. \n\"But every time we find a weakness, it learns from us and the weakness disappears the next day.\" \nHe added that the professionals had been sharing notes and tips in an effort to find weaknesses in the AI's game-play. \nBut they were not the only ones doing homework. \nEach night after the play ended, the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Centre added computations to sharpen the AI's strategy. \nAll four human players shared the $200,000 (£159,000) prize fund, ranked in order of how well they played against the AI. \nJason Les, who came fourth, summed up the feelings of all four players when he said the match had been \"incredibly challenging\". \n\"I was impressed with the quality of poker Libratus played,\" he said. \n\"We tried everything we could, but it was just too strong. It became very demoralising.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:07:09.365+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
