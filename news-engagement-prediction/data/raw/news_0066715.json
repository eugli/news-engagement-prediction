It had contemporary looks, a refined engine and a peppy drive. But every hero is challenged and often brought down by new heroes, and the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz turned from the challenger to the conqueror. \n\nFast forward to 2017 and the erstwhile hero has staked claim to its throne once again. Does the Honda City 2017 have what it takes to return to the pinnacle of compact sedans segment in India? Read on. \n\nFirst up, City 2017 is not a generational change but a striking facelift. In a price-conscious market which is fast becoming almost equally observant of looks, City 2017 clearly seeks to target not just the Ciaz but the Hyundai Verna as well. \n\n\n\nExteriors \n\nFrom a distance, City 2017 continues to have the same genetic structure as the outgoing model. Come closer and the additions and alterations become amply clear. And it is fresh, fun and yet somehow, reassuringly familiar. \n\n\n\nThe VX and ZX variants now come with sharp LED headlights with fog lamps which makes an extremely stylish statement - similar to one already seen on the Honda Accord Hybrid. DRLs further add to the looks and Honda have opted to incorporate them in all variants. The front grille also gets updated with a honeycomb design and a slimmer chrome bar. While it does add to the sharp features of the front, it is a cosmetic tweak at best. There are edges and curves galore which encompass the changes well. \n\nWhile the front gets the bulk of the changes, the rear too now sport LED tail-lamps. The rear bumper now has a noticeable honeycomb design element which is a nice addition. Overall though, the City 2017 from the back is unmistakably reminiscent of the outgoing model. \n\n\n\n\nThe sides are almost identical to the outgoing model but the now 16-inch tyres make the car have a slightly better - and much-needed - stance. The alloys on the top end look extremely sporty and complete a package that is likely to attract prospective buyers from all age groups. \n\n\n\n\nInteriors \n\nHonda has been quite woeful in terms of gizmoz it offers in its cars. The BRV is one such example where even the top-end was bereft of an touchscreen display. City 2017, however, will delight drivers and passengers alike with the features incorporated. \n\nThe 7-inch touchscreen - termed as DIGIPAD by Honda - is one of the best in the segment - in terms of interface, ease of use, features and day-time brightness. The user interface is based on Android system while Android Auto and Apple Car Play are supported. \n\n\n\nThe addition of an HDMI port is unique but video playback while the car is in motion is disabled for safety reasons - much like in competing cars from other brands. \n\n\n\n\nMirrorlink support for smartphone connectivity is another good addition but what really seals the deal is the addition of a net browser to stay updated. Just create a WiFi Hotspot through the phone or drive into a public WiFi area and the entire world would open up on the screen. While this may be a novelty feature to begin with, the fact that the convenience has been added shows Honda's positive intent to (finally) move with the times. \n\n\n\n\nA special mention needs to be reserved for the sound system inside the City 2017 which now sounds fuller, richer and a definite step up. \n\nThe car is loaded with charging ports all around and there is ample storage space for essentials - much like in any new-age car on the road today. \n\nHonda has chosen to retain the piano-finish on the front console which has its merits and demerits as while it makes for a classy look in a black-beige colour tone, it also does attract enormous amount of dust and fingerprints. \n\n\n\nNo such problem when it comes to the seat and the leather upholstery in the top variants continues to be premium. \n\n\n\n\nAs for space, there is no change and the City will continue to seat five passengers comfortably. Reclining rear seats and buttons for front seat adjustment - even if only for the driver - would have, however, made for even better additions. \n\nThere is a one-touch button though for the sunroof which now opens completely to make winter drives under the sun pleasant. For most parts of the year, and in most parts of India, this will continue to be firmly shut. \n\nDrive \n\nThe City 2017 sees no mechanical change and it is quite easy to see why. The planted and mature drive of the City petrol won several hearts and to change a good thing would have been a tad too risky - and perhaps un-needed. So, the 1.5 litre i-VTEC engine delivering 117 hp of power maintains its hereditary poise while the 1.5 litre i-DTEC unit with 99hp of power too will gobble up miles with ease. \n\n\n\nThe City 2017 comes in manual and auto transmission options but the top end only gets the auto. For those looking for top-end features in an exciting manual transmission option, this can be a significant downer. For all others, it once again comes as good news that the Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) once again offers a better claimed mileage than the manual counterpart - \n\nCruise control on top end will delight highway drivers once again and the top-end CVT comes with paddle shifters and two drive modes - Eco and Sports. \n\nVerdict \n\nHonda engines have traditionally been raved about but the Japanese auto giants have lacked behind in terms of looks and creature comforts. The Brio, Mobilio and BRV have not really raked up sales numbers and the City too has been losing out to rivals. \n\nThe City 2017 makes a strong case to change not just its image but that of the company itself. New-age looks and a plethora of features make it a very strong contender to reclaim the mantle. While there are variants galore, it would have ticked all boxes had the price-game - one that Maruti Suzuki plays extremely well - been kept in check as well. \n\n\n\n\nAt Rs 13.52 L for the top-end CVT petrol, the City pricing is not the most attractive even if the car itself is. For those who would not put a price tag on a premium product though, the new City comes highly rated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:56:23.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
