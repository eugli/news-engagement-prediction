VIEW GALLERY Chloe's adorable letter caught the attention of google CEO Sundar \nSpeaking to HELLO! Online , proud dad Andy revealed that his daughter was literally jumping for joy when she realised who the letter was from. \"Chloe was initially happy to receive the letter with the Google logo, then when I informed her it was from 'the boss' and gave her some more details, she was over the moon,\" he said. \"She just kept jumping up and down!\" \nMORE: Dad recreates Beauty and the Beast scenes with daughter \nHe explained that Chloe was first inspired to write to Google after chatting to her dad about what he did for a living. \"She and I were talking about my job and what I do - I am a sales manager for a refrigeration company – and as a seven-year-old I could see this wasn't all that interesting to her,\" he revealed. \"Then she asked where I would really like to work, so I said Google and continued to show her the cool offices with ball pits, slides, go karts and more. That set her heart on working there and hence the reason she wrote the letter.\" \nAndy himself was initially sceptical when he saw the reply from Google, but was delighted to see Sundar had taken the time to reply. \"Originally I was quite impressed with the reply from Google but just imagined it to be from a marketing team or PA at the most,\" he admitted. \"When I saw it was from Sundar himself and actually signed by him I was blown away. I couldn't believe one man in such an important and elevated position in one of the biggest companies in the world could take time out to respond my daughter's letter.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T16:16:22.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
