It's just been day 46 (post delivery) and it feels great. The idea is to do what I have been always loved to do, which is work. It is a part of my DNA, it's a part of me. It's never going to change.\" \nThe actress also praised Dongre and added that the show, which was inspired by Lakme's theme, Liquid Gold, is inspiring Indian women \"to be independent, work and to be out there...\" \nThe models sashayed down 60 ensembles on the runway on classics like What a Wonderful World played by a live band.
