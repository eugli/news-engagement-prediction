Get at me: lwilliams@thinkprogress.org. 8 hrs ago Apple CEO wants schools to help fix the world’s fake news problem In Telegraph interview, Tim Cook said battling fake news needs to be “ingrained in the schools” because “it’s killing people’s minds.” Apple CEO Tim Cook waves at members of the media as he leaves 10 Downing Street in London, Thursday, Feb. 9, 2017. CRDIT: AP Photo/Matt Dunham For Apple CEO Tim Cook, fake news isn’t just a social media phenomenon, it’s a societal problem that needs to be addressed in every corner of our culture, starting with the education system. “It has to be ingrained in the schools, it has to be ingrained in the public,” Cook told the UK’s Telegraph in an exclusive interview. “There has to be a massive campaign.” The rise of fake news is a “short-term thing” that people don’t want, Cook said, emphasizing that a problem which is “killing people’s minds” can only be solved by educating children who will then push their parents to act. “It’s almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid,” he said. “In some ways kids will be the easiest to educate. At least before a certain age, they are very much in listen and understand [mode], and they then push their parents to act. We saw this with environmental issues: kids learning at school and coming home and saying why do you have this plastic bottle? Why are you throwing it away?” Cook outlined a vision where private industries—particularly tech—and government collaborate and tackle fake news as a global problem. His comments come at a time when tech companies, including his own, are grappling with how to address public concerns of misinformation spreading on their platforms, without trampling on ideals of free speech and press. Facebook has been at the center of the discussion after the company fired its human news editors that curated content on the platform’s trending topics section last year. The move to algorithm-only curation triggered an immediate change in what kinds of stories floated to the top of users’ feeds, allowing things like deliberate hoaxes and salacious headlines to spread, unchecked, as fact.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:03:38.017+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
