Nathan was waiting for Caleb at the bottom of the slide when the accident happened. \n“He was screaming: ‘He flew from Verruckt! He flew from Verruckt!’” Michele Schwab said. \nWhen she tried to get closer, a man would not let her. \n“He just kept saying, ‘Trust me, you don’t want to go any further,’” Michele Schwab said. \nThe shock was so great, Scott Schwab demanded that someone actually confirm his son’s death. \n“I said, ‘I just need to hear you say, is my son dead?’ and he just shook his head,” Scott Schwab said. “‘I need to hear it from you, is he dead?’ And he said, ‘Yes, your son’s dead.’” \nSchwab said it was surreal — he didn’t even remember driving home. \nThe Schwabs have since reached a settlement with Schlitterbahn. \n“It’s an accident, but there’s an accounting because someone was negligent,” Scott Schwab said. \nThey agreed to the interview to express their gratitude for the support they have received. \n“We have a box of greeting cards from around the world, and we just want people to know that one, we’re thankful,” Scott Schwab said. “And yeah, we’re still hurting, but we’re going to be OK.” \nCaleb Thomas Schwab - family photo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:06:40.599+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
