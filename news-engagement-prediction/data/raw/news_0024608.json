He is already 56 years old and bald-headed. \nPolice should just monitor his movements. It is silly for some to call for his arrest when he is back in Malaysia. \nP Dev Anand Pillai: 'Gotcha' has got it correct. There are many sexual predators in the country who are still on the loose. This man has served his time. \nFurthermore, he has left the country for more than 36 years. It may be a different country to him now, so just monitor him. \nOur police officers are very good at monitoring opposition politicians - keeping an eye on an old sex offender should not be a problem. \nAnd remember the former Malaysian military attaché in New Zealand who wanted to woo the girl by defecating in front of her house? He is back, so how come there is not much noise made about him? \nAnonymous #03815719: The rapist has served his sentence, and according to due process, he is being deported to the country of origin. \nHe should be monitored by the authorities, not detained. Even Islamic State (IS) returnees are not locked up. \nWira : Detain him under what law, PKR Wanita chief Zuraida Kamaruddin? And for how long? \nMD Alforit : Yes, lock him up on what charges? You can't just lock up someone - what if the police locks one of your family member for no reason? \nSend in the Clowns: A rapist is a criminal, but also a very mentally sick man. He should be treated by an expert to find out what is the best solution to keep women safe. There is no justification to leave him in jail to rot. \nThe authorities might just as well make him a eunuch. Tell me, which treatment is more cruel? \nAnnonymous : This is very scary - there are so many self-righteous \"sane\" people here blinded by hatred and who have the same DNA of the Taliban and IS extremists. They have so much hatred and vengeance, calling for the cutting off of hands and so on of the offender. \nThis convict is sick: a highly-intoxicated sex addict born with an overdose of hormones and has the DNA of a pervert - he certainly needs help and a second chance in life. \nHe has served his sentence and to punish him twice is not just. \nPunishment of 24 years in prison is a very long time and similar to a life sentence. A civilized society has no choice but to pray and help this man to repent and cure his malady and not just judge him and condemn him to hell. \nYes, we have to monitor him and be alert to this potential threat at all times. Just thank God that you were not born like this man, or like the hideous billion-dollar kleprocrat who has done worse crimes against humanity and made 29 million people suffer while he is free to commit more crimes against the people. \nYes, every saint has a past and every sinner has a future. \nAs the saying goes, 'Weak people revenge. Strong people forgive. Intelligent people ignore,” said Albert Einstein. Or as Mahatma Gandhi said, “An eye for an eye, will make the world go blind,” said Mahatma Gandhi. \nFor those who are without sin, cast the first stone. To err is human, to forgive is divine. \nWanita MCA: DAP MP's 'defence' of serial rapist regrettable \nWorried Sick: Wanita MCA Heng Siai Kie has taken stupidity to a whole new level. She does not understand the constitution and talks very selectively about criminals. \nWhere was she when rapists in our own country were imprisoned and let off after serving their time? Did she make any noise? \nOf late, have you all noticed all types of politicians talking silly and getting their two sen's worth. One wonders why? \nP Dev Anand Pillai: First of all, read what Bukit Gelugor MP Ramkarpal Singh had to say, then also analyse what the inspector-general of police Khalid Abu Bakar had to say about this convict from Canada. He can't be charged here because he hasn' committed a crime here. \nOur law is being explained, and these explanations are not meant to protect him in any way. If he is charged, what is he going to be charged with? A prospective tendency and probability to rape, is it? \nPerhaps these MCA politicians can devise a kind of chastity belt for him so that all women in Malaysia will be protected from this beast. \nLéon Moch: In that case, go enact the laws first then talk. As the law stands currently, Ramkarpal is correct in his opinion regarding the unconstitutionality of Heng's suggestion. He is not defending the rapist but merely stating the law. \nI'm sure many would like to see serial rapists castrated, but if a lawyer says the law does not currently permit the castration of serial rapists, it certainly does not mean he is defending the rapist. \nDavid Dass: The man has served his sentence in Canada. It was not a light sentence – 24 years. He cannot be tried again for the same offence. \nA register is possible and even a tracking device. But the science must be compelling - that he is more than likely to commit rape again. Otherwise it will make nonsense of the double jeopardy rule. And there is good reason for that rule. \nSouthpaw: A person who has zero understanding on the constitutional guarantees like Heng and Zuraida should never be in the government. Because all they do is to make themselves look really silly. \nAgain, should the same argument by Heng apply to the paedophile sponsored by Mara? \nMafeeah: Heng, the majority of the netizens and leaders have asked for Prime Minister Najib Razak to step down. Does he have to do as everyone wishes? \nYou look at the law that you in MCA have enacted in the past, and ask your fellow BN MPs to urgently table an amended one to protect women and children arising from this saga. \nGet your law minister to do this as soon as possible, and stop going after the opposition. \nThe Analyser: Selva's fate should be left to professionals who know what they are talking about ... not to paranoid political wannabes who don't know what they are talking about. \nThe above is a selection of comments posted by Malaysiakini subscribers.
