Somehow they all just slot in perfectly.” \nHamilton said he already had a positive impression from the bigger tires. \n“Driving today, naturally the car feels wider, which it is obviously, so the front tires feel huge, there is quite a lot of grip already even in the cold conditions here. This is not a test, the laps I did today were behind a vehicle to get filming in, and then it’s really just a shakedown – so you do a couple of slow laps just to see if the car will run. \n“So it is not actually a test. I got to go a little bit faster in some places, but it’s so gusty here, so it’s quite tricky, and it’s wet, so I was on slicks on a damp track. The car honestly just feels almost identical to last years’ car in terms of the ergonomics, the seat position and steering, but then you’ve got bigger and this more powerful beast around you.” \nHamilton stressed that there’s still a lot of work to do. \n“Finding the limits of the car is the big question mark, where is the limit of the car where is the limit of tires? At what point is the car going to roll over tire and oversteer, understeer, or lock up. So that’s what we have to do. You basically have to learn to walk as fast as you can before you run, and when we get to Barcelona that’s when where that comes into play. \n“Then we have to understand how to switch these tires on, if it’s a one lap or two warm-up laps or more, and then how long the tires last, how you utilize the life of the tires over a long run, so part through test we will get into race runs, which is grueling, because you go in, you do your pit stops, and it’s practice for everyone. The tires are bigger and heavier, so the mechanics are going to have to be bulking up a little bit to lift these tires.” Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas will drive the Mercedes F1 W08 during the 2017 F1 season.
