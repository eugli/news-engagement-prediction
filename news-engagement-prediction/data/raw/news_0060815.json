tribute to George Michael on the Brit Awards on Wednesday (22 February), after being welcomed to the stage by his former Wham! bandmates. \nThe Coldplay frontman sang a stripped-back version of

ITV Chris Martin on stage at the Brits \nDuring an instrumental section, a touching quote from George was also played across the arena, during which he was heard saying: “I never wanted to be someone else. I wanted to be a star, and I wanted people to love me…but I never really wanted to be someone else.” Barcroft Media via Getty Images ﻿The incomparable George Michael \nPrior to Chris’s appearance, former bandmate Andrew Ridgeley described him as “the greatest singer/songwriter of his generation”, “an icon of his era” and his “beloved friend”. \nHe concluded: “George has left for us, in his songs… the very best of himself. I loved him, and in turn, you, we have been loved.” ITV Andrew Ridgely appeared on stage with Pepsi and Shirlie \nIn the lead up to this year’s Brits, bosses had confirmed George would be honoured on the night, with speculation about how would perform quickly following. \nThames Valley Police later confirmed a post-mortem examination into the cause of his death has been inconclusive . \nIn the immediate aftermath of his death, tributes form George’s collaborators, fans and admirers poured out online, and Elton John later lamented his passing during a Las Vegas concert , breaking down during a rendition of their duet, ‘Don’t Let The Sun Go Down On Me’. \nFor all the winners from this year’s Brits click here.
