The CST said recorded incidents last year had increased by 36 per cent on 2015. \nMore than three-quarters of all recorded incidents took place in Greater London and Greater Manchester, where the two largest Jewish communities in the U.K. are located. \nAccording to the report, there were 107 violent anti-Semitic assaults reported — the highest number since 2010; 287 anti-Semitic incidents involved social media; damage and desecration to Jewish property increased by a quarter — 81 recorded incidents; and 1,006 incidents of abusive behaviour, including verbal abuse, hate mail and anti-Semitic graffiti. \nAnti-Semites “emboldened” \nMark Gardner, from the CST, said anti-Semites currently felt “emboldened”. \n“Racists, including anti-Semites, feel emboldened, feel encouraged, at this moment in time, for a whole range of reasons, to come out with their hatred,” the BBC reported citing Mr. Gardner as saying. “They used to keep it under the ground. Now they’re coming out. A lid has been lifted off.” \nThe CST said a perceived increase in racism and xenophobia following Britain’s move to exit the European Union has contributed to the rise.
