The Opening Regionals hit Miami on Sunday, and the camp features several top prospects. 247Sports brings you the top overall performers from the day. ALPHA DOG Plantation (Fla.) American Heritage edge rusher Andrew Chatfield dominated offensive tackles from start to finish. The 6-foot-3, 220-pounder prospect used his elite quickness to consistently win his one-on-one reps. Chatfield ability to bend around the edge makes him a very effective pass rusher. LSU appears to have the edge in his recruitment. Next Five on Defense 1. S Josh Jobe — The Miami four-star commit was very good in coverage and was able to jump multiple crossing routes to get pass break ups. The physical 6-foot-1, 180-pound Miami (Fla.) Columbus product thrived in press coverage where he used his strength to knock receivers off their routes. 2. DT Nesta Silvera — The Miami three-star commit used an impressive combination of strength and quickness to bully his way past interior offensive linemen. The 6-foot-2, 310-pound Plantation (Fla.) American Heritage product was not a one-trick pony with just a bull rush like most defensive tackles. Silvera was able to make himself skinny to knife through gaps as well. 3. CB Kaiir Elam — The North Palm Beach (Fla.) Benjamin School 2019 prospect is a name to watch in the future. At 6-foot-1, 180-pounds, Elam showed good coverage skills and was able to get his hands on multiple passes. Elam is the son of former NFL safety Abe Elam. Marshall and Kentucky have handed out early offers to Elam. 4. CB Asante Samuel Jr. — There might not have been a smoother and more impressive looking defensive back going through drills than this Ft. Lauderdale (Fla.) St. Thomas Aquinas product. The 5-foot-10, 170-pound Samuel is competitive, quick, and technically sound. Florida State is considered the heavy favorite for Samuel. 5. LB Yasir Abdullah — The Miami (Fla.) Carol City product was flashed impressive athleticism and body control during cat and mouse drills against running backs. The 6-foot-2, 200-pound prospect was efficient with his movements, which helped him win the MVP of the linebacker group from camp coaches. Top Five on Offense 1. OL Delone Scaife — The Miami offensive line commit might have been the surprise of the entire camp. The 6-foot-3, 290-pound prospect worked at left tackle where he was quick enough to handle speed rushes off the edge with better than anticipated feet. Scaife showed good strength locking up pass rushers as soon as he got his hands on them. 2. WR Kevin Austin — The Coconut Creek (Fla.) North Broward Prep product looked to be the most complete wide receiver in attendance. Standing 6-foot-3, 185-pounds, Austin is a fluid athlete with enough speed to stretch the field. Austin looks to be one of the more physically gifted receivers in the Sunshine State in this recruiting cycle. 3. WR Dominick Watt — When it came to production on Sunday, this Hollywood (Fla.) McArthur standout might have topped the list for the receivers. The 6-foot-2, 195-pound Watt is not a speed burner, but he was able to consistently get open down the field. Watt, who named Florida his leader on the day, was most effective on post routes the entire day. 4. RB Shaun Shivers — The Auburn commit did not look as comfortable catching passes out of the backfield as other running backs at the camp, but when it came to cat and mouse drills against linebackers, there was not have been a more explosive back. The 5-foot-7, 170-pound Hollywood (Fla.) Chaminade-Madonna product did not look to juke defenders much, he was about making one cut and getting up field in a hurry. 5. WR Anthony Schwartz — The Plantation (Fla.) American Heritage product is clearly a speed demon with the ability to stretch the field vertically. The 5-foot-11, 170-pound prospect hauled in perhaps the most impressive catches of the day on tipped pass that he adjusted and corralled in the end zone. Schwartz is certainly an intriguing prospect despite limited reps this past fall. Others of Note —Naples (Fla.) Gulf Coast tight end George Takacs is an impressive looking prospect that checks in at 6-foot-6, 230-pounds. His frame looks able to carry plenty more weight, but Takacs looked to be an effective route runner and pass catcher as well. Florida, Georgia, and Wisconsin sit at the top of Takacs’ recruitment. — Patrick Joyner of Homestead (Fla.) South Dade played as an outside linebacker this past fall, but Sunday he worked out as a defensive end. The 6-foot-2, 220-pound prospect who just landed an offer from Florida State looks like a high-upside prospect with his athleticism and raw ability. —Miami (Fla.) Carol City 2019 running back Nay’quan Wright looked very smooth with nifty feet in cat and mouse drills against linebackers. The 5-foot-8, 185-pound prospect proved to be a tough tackle in the open field. —Miami quarterback commit Artur Sitkowski once again displayed an elite arm. The Bradenton (Fla.) IMG Academy signal caller consistently impresses in these camp settings where he flashes the arm strength to make all the throws on the field. —Plantation (Fla.) American Heritage five-star cornerback Patrick Surtain Jr. did not compete as he rehabs a torn hamstring. Surtain said he would be out six weeks, and plans to be ready for spring practices in May.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:30:32.456+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
