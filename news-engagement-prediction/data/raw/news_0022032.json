That's what could fucking happen. \nEarlier today, the former Arsenal goalkeeper's Instagram account was updated with a deluge of snaps of girls in various states of undress, showing off an incredibly X Rated 'two up top' and 'back line'. Credit: Wojciech Szczesny/Instagram \nThe photos have since been deleted and it appears the Polish stopper, now at Roma, has had his account hacked. How this has actually happened is unclear, whether it's a vengeful Arsenal supporting cyber criminal out to ruin Szczesny's career or simply a friend having a laugh. The Roma man has posted a follow up message to clear up any confusion, although states that his hacker still has access to his account for the time being...
