(Photo: Getty Images for TAG Heuer) \nTom Brady is fresh off his fifth Super Bowl win, which undeniably made his autograph more valuable. \nHe seems to be taking advantage of that … in a big way. \nThe memorabilia and autograph service, Tristar , announced a private signing with Brady, and it is going to cost so much money for the future Hall of Famer's autograph. \nTristar broke the costs down by item, adding fees for special notes and personalized messages. \nLicensed trading card (3.5″ x 5″) - $499 Flat Item up to and including 11×14 - $799 Flat Item larger than 11×14, mini helmet, or football - $819 Full size helmet, or NFL licensed jersey - $849 Reproduced artwork, canvas, or multi-signed item with 5 or more signatures - $1,399 Original artwork, game used, or any other item not listed - $1,999 Inscription - Choose 1 from: 4x SB MVP, SB 51 MVP, SB 49 MVP, SB 38 MVP, SB 36 MVP, 16-0 '07 - $299 Inscription - Choose 1 from: 2x NFL MVP, 5x SB Champ, SB 51 Champs, 07 NFL MVP, 10 NFL MVP - $399 Personalization up to 20 characters - $499 \n$499 for 20 characters?! That's absurd. And craziest of all, this won't be a public signing. Brady will just be signing a ton of memorabilia with representatives of Tristar, and those signed products will be delivered to the customers. Johnny Manziel even met the fans at his autograph signing. \nThe prices have also gone up since Brady's last signing with Tristar. Back in 2015 , a \"flat item\" went for $649. It is now $799. \nAnother championship ring will do that.
