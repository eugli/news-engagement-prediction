Trident Custom Coatings LLC is expanding into the purchase and sale of guns in East Dundee. (Erin Sauder / The Courier-News) Privacy Policy \nAn East Dundee firearms coating business has the OK from village officials to expand into the purchase and sale of guns. \nA special-use permit request from Tyson Cobb, owner of Trident Custom Coatings LLC, 555 Plate Drive, was approved at Monday's board meeting. \nTrident specializes in hydrographic printing, DuraCoat applications to hunting gear and other types of firearms, as well as other protective coatings. According to Trident's website, the company has differentiated itself \"by coating anything from engine parts to mailboxes, and much more.\" \nA public hearing on Cobb's request was held during a January planning and zoning meeting. Commission members recommended approval of the special-use permit subject to several conditions, including that Trident ensures inventory is locked in a secure space with a village-approved burglar alarm, records all firearm sales and purchases and makes them available to the police chief, and operates the gun shop as an accessory use to the coating business.

(Robert McCoppin and Tony Briscoe) \nVillage Administrator Bob Skurla said the company's property is located in a designated M-1 limited manufacturing district where a gun shop is allowed under a special-use permit. \nBefore the vote, Trustee Rob Gorman asked Police Chief Terry Mee and Village Attorney Kathleen Orr if they were comfortable with the proposal. \nBoth said yes. \n\"We have a major gun retailer in town,\" Mee said, referring to GAT Guns on Route 25. \"And we've experienced no problems there. I'll be scheduling a walk-through with the owner and see if there's anything we need to talk about.\" \nOrr added, \"The regulations are there to support you in terms of making sure it's properly run.\" \nTrustee Jeff Lynam asked if guns would be tested at the site. \nMee said no. \n\"They'd have to have a range to do that and they're not set up for that,\" he said. \nErin Sauder is a freelance reporter for the Courier-News.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T03:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:59:16.380+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
