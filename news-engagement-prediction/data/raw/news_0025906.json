EU nationals should never be used as a bargaining chip in Brexit negotiations and the government could and should have resolved this months ago. \nNot only did I and Labour MPs vote for an amendment to this effect in the Commons on 8 February, but I also drafted and moved amendments on this (NC6 and NC8) that would have ensured the legal rights of EU nationals in the UK. Jeremy Corbyn also pushed the prime minister on this in the Commons as recently as 6 February. \nResolving the legal status of EU nationals has been and remains a key priority for Labour, and we will continue to push amendments on this as the European Union (notification of withdrawal) bill moves to the House of Lords. \nIt is factually wrong and entirely misleading to suggest Labour has done anything other than led calls for this clear injustice to be resolved. Keir Starmer Shadow secretary of state for exiting the EU \n• As chair of a local Labour party, I am tired of Labour being blamed for the leave vote. Labour neither asked for this referendum, nor set the terms for it. David Cameron is to blame for this mess and he quickly scuttled off. It does not matter this referendum was ill-considered, designed to try to silence the Tory’s extreme wing, and that 16- 17-year-olds were not allowed to vote. The fact is that the electorate voted to leave the EU. If we remainers had won by 52% to 48%, we would have taken the high ground on attempts to alter the decision. I along with many in the Labour party fought hard for a yes vote. While locally where I live, we voted for remain, across the country we lost. \nLabour put forward a number of amendments to the bill, but without the support of some Tory MPs there was never a chance of changing it. At the end, voting against the bill would have been a denial of the fact that we, the remainers, lost, and simply self-indulgent. We don’t have to give up: amendments are possible in the Lords; and there will be opportunities in the next two years to influence the final outcome. \nLabour is simply recognising the reality of the situation. Labour must now fight for the best deal we can, and to hold this government to account, during which Labour must be vigilant to the desire of those who want to get out of the EU whatever the consequences.
