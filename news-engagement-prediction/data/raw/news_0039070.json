A \"two-state solution\" to the decades-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is the declared goal of their leaders and the international community.\nIt is the shorthand for a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent state of Palestine within pre-1967 ceasefire lines in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, living peacefully alongside Israel.\nThe UN, the Arab League, the European Union, Russia and, until now, the US routinely restate their commitment to the concept.\nWhen he was asked about a two-state solution on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu said he wanted to focus on \"substance\" and not \"labels\".\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, meanwhile, said he remained committed to the goal.\nHe also seized on President Trump's comments urging Mr Netanyahu to \"hold back on settlements for a little bit\".\nTrump's view on the two-state solution Since Mr Trump took office last month, Israel has approved thousands of new homes in West Bank and East Jerusalem, land claimed by the Palestinians for a future state.\nThe settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\nAlternative concepts to a two-state solution: Unitary, bi-national state : A single country of Israel and the occupied territories, with equal rights for Israel and Palestinians. Advocated for years by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) but opposed by many Israeli Jews, who say absorbing a large Arab population would mean national suicide \"State-minus\" : Favoured by Benjamin Netanyahu, offering Palestinians enhanced self-rule without full statehood, with a permanent Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley. Rejected by Palestinians as unacceptable. Confederation: Sometimes referred to as the \"three-state solution\" comprising an Israeli and/or Palestinian confederation with Jordan, the majority of whose population is Palestinian. Floated as an idea down the years but has never taken root as an option favoured by any of the parties. Unilateral withdrawal : Also known as \"constructive unilateralism\". Envisages an Israeli pull-back on its terms from parts of the West Bank, setting its own borders and separating itself from the bulk of the Palestinian population. Assumes failure of peace process and has no support among international community. Reconsidering the two-state solution\nThe Israeli government is hoping for better relations with the White House after eight years of friction with the former Obama administration.\nAt Wednesday's news conference, neither leader committed explicitly to back a future independent Palestine, a longstanding bedrock of US policy.\nThe idea of creating an independent Palestinian state that co-exists with Israel has underpinned Middle East peace policy for decades It was the US and Israeli leaders' first face-to-face meeting since Mr Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election.\nBut France, which in January organised a multi-national conference which reaffirmed support for a two-state solution alone, seemed unimpressed with the apparent change in direction.\nIts ambassador to the UN, Francois Delattre, told reporters \"our commitment to the two-state solution is stronger than ever\", according to AFP news agency.\nMeanwhile, Mr Trump's choice for America's next ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, faces a rocky confirmation hearing before the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday, the Associated Press reports.\nThe right-winger is a strong critic of the two-state solution, supports Jewish settlement building and moving the US embassy to Jerusalem.\nDavid Friedman advised Mr Trump during his election campaign Five former US ambassadors to Israel have written a letter to committee members declaring him unqualified because of his \"extreme, radical positions\", AP says.\nAsked on Wednesday about his campaign promise of moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, Mr Trump said: \"I'd love to see that happen.\"\n\"And we're looking at it very, very strongly. We're looking at it with a great care, a great care, believe me. And we'll see what happens.\"\nThe Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their promised future state - but Israel claims the entire city as its undivided capital.", "external_links": ["http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/country-files/israel-palestinian-territories/peace-process/initiative-for-the-middle-east-peace-process/article/conference-for-peace-in-the-middle-east-15-01-17", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0EFB/production/_94653830_de30a554-8311-420c-85ca-62aa6d8f8b0b.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/08DD/production/_92996220_mediaitem92996219.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7F16/production/_92443523_464x2.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-21850739"], "published": "2017-02-16T16:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:09:32.890+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
