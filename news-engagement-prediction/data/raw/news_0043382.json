Said: \"The task of criticism...is to make distinctions...To oppose Zionism in Palestine has never meant, and does not now mean, being anti-Semitic.\"\nTo describe the murder of six million Jewish people like this frankly beggars belief Sir Eric Pickles S ir Eric said: \"To describe the murder of six million Jewish people like this frankly beggars belief. I am all for debate and freedom and speech but this passes into a new dimension\".\nGideon Falter, chairman of the charity Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, called on the university to dismiss Dr Gould, adding that the university's mention of \"academic freedom\" leaves him with \"scant confidence in the quality of their investigation\"\nA spokesman for Bristol University said that the vice-Chancellor received a formal letter of complaint about the lecturer at the end of last week. \n“Academic freedom and freedom of speech are at the heart of our mission at the University of Bristol,” the spokesman said.\n“Since receiving a letter from the Campaign against Anti-Semitism yesterday we are actively looking into this matter.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:23:03.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
