Does that mean there won’t be black on the Lions uniforms anymore? It appears that might be the case. Great idea! If they keep going, maybe no one will recognize the team that has failed its fans over and over. \n— Detroit Lions (@Lions) February 1, 2017 \nLast season Detroit Lions president Rod Wood did say the team would look at their entire uniform as well as the scheme and look. This looks like the first step. \nAlso will this change the Color Rush uniforms the Lions will wear this season? \nDo you like the change the team made?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:56:16.158+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
