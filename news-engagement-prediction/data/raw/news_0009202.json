Protests \nPassengers travelling between London and Glasgow, or London and Edinburgh, may also benefit from clearer pricing. \nOperators currently have to offer a return fare between these cities which is regulated by the government. But the RDG says it would be more transparent - and possibly cheaper - for commuters if the single fares were regulated instead. \nIt wants more airline-style booking of single fares - at ticket offices and ticket machines, as well as on the internet. \n\"We're determined to overhaul the system to cut out red-tape, jargon and complication to make it easier for customers to buy fares they can trust, including from ticket machines,\" said Jacqueline Starr, RDG director of customer experience. \nThe trial will also see the removal of some historic fares which do not make sense. \nAt the moment passengers travelling between London St Pancras and Sheffield pay extra to travel via Grantham, for example, even though it takes longer. \nSuch fares date back to the pre-privatisation era of British Rail. \nThe price of average train fares - including regulated and unregulated tickets - went up by 2.3% in January , even though consumer prices rose by just 1.6% last year. \nThe rise led to protests by passengers and rail unions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:17:09.220+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
