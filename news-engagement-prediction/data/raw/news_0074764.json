SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Tony Abbott has signalled the contest for the soul of the modern Liberal Party has a long way to run. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nMr Abbott noted nearly 40 per cent of Australians didn't vote for the Coalition or Labor in the 2016 election - \"It's easy to see why\". \nIn a sign a return to the leadership was on his radar, Mr Abbott set out ideas on how to take the fight to Labor and win back Coalition voters thinking of defecting to Pauline Hanson's One Nation. \n\"In short, why not say to the people of Australia: we'll cut the RET [renewable energy target] to help with your power bills; we'll cut immigration to make housing more affordable; we'll scrap the Human Rights Commission to stop official bullying; we'll stop all new spending to end ripping off our grandkids; and we'll reform the Senate to have government, not gridlock?\" \nHe said the next election was winnable for the Coalition, however, \"our challenge is to be worth voting for. It's to win back the people who are giving up on us\". Advertisement \nThe speech contained thinly-veiled swipes at Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne, and populist Senate crossbenchers who refused to back what he argued are necessary spending cuts. \nHe called for political parties to have a purpose and program, and said that \"our politics can't be just a contest of toxic egos or someone'Â€s vanity project\". \nIn a clear reference to the decision to award the $50 billion submarine project to French company DCNS - which will deliver a massive jobs and investment windfall to Mr Pyne's home state of South Australia - Mr Abbott said government had to \"ensure that our armed forces are about protecting the country not just creating jobs in Adelaide\". \nThe speech - and the five-point plan - will likely infuriate Turnbull supporters and progressives on the Left of politics and delight conservatives. \nOn housing, Mr Abbott stated \"if we end the 'big is best' thinking of the federal Treasury, and scaled back immigration (at least until housing starts and infrastructure have caught up), we can take the pressure off home prices\", without nominating a target. \nThat call to scale back immigration is likely to resonate with would-be Hanson voters, while the call to address housing affordability - a hot-button issue, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne, which the Turnbull government is grappling with in the lead-up to the next budget - will resonate with people struggling to get into the housing market. \nMr Abbott did not nominate a revised target migration figure. According to the ABS, in 2014-15 net overseas migration was 168,200 people. \nThe former prime minister's call to scrap the Human Rights Commission and \"leave protecting our liberties to the Parliament, the courts and a free press where they belong\" will win favour with conservatives. The Coalition government has frequently been at loggerheads with the organisation. \nHe called to stop all new federal spending and reduce the power of the Senate crossbench and legislative \"gridlock\", by altering section 57 of the constitution via a referendum. This will allow laws that have been twice rejected by the upper house to go directly to a joint sitting, without a double dissolution election. \nThey are bold prescriptions the Turnbull government is unlikely to take on. \nOn the RET, Mr Abbott said: \"We subsidise wind to make coal uneconomic so now we are proposing to subsidise coal to keep the lights on. Go figure. Wouldn't it be better to abolish subsidies for new, renewable generation and let ordinary market forces do the rest?\" \nThe federal government has indicated the 23 per cent-by-2020 RET, set during the former prime minister's tenure, will not be altered. This is even as it has in recent months, following a series of power blackouts in South Australia, sought to wedge Labor at state and federal levels over its support for even higher renewable energy targets post-2020.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T11:01:59.191+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
