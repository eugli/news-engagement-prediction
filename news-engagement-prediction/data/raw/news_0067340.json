Save Todd Williamson via Getty Images \nNetflix is making another big movie splash, as IndieWire is the first to report that it's acquiring the rights to Martin Scorsese's $100 million+ gangster flick The Irishman . Reportedly in the works since at least 2010 , the project is supposed to unite the legendary moviemaker with both Robert de Niro and Al Pacino. The big budget is apparently due to the use of Benjamin Button-style special effects to make its actors appear younger for certain scenes. The story is adapted from the nonfiction book I Heard You Paint Houses , about mob hitman Frank \"The Irishman\" Sheeran. \nA deal for Paramount to release the movie apparently fell through -- possibly related to a poor opening for the Scorsese/Paramount produced Silence -- opening the door for Netflix to flex its deep pockets and worldwide release capability. Despite those issues, judging by the names attached -- which are said to also include Joe Pesci -- The Irishman is a good bet to stay far away from the MST3K screen.
