Romanian national Greg Bulbuc had lived in the UK since 2001 (Facebook) \nMs Skutane said: “You’ve always been in our hearts, we love you so much. \n“Hope you will see how your son grow up. Greg hope we been longer time together like a family. Love you to bits.” \nHer sister Linda wrote: “It’s so painful when you know person of our family is gone forever and this person never gonna come back. \n“We miss him already, we loved him so much and we still love him. He was a good father for his child. But now he’s gone.” Police incident in Bermondsey \nMr Bulbuc’s cousin Danut, who lives in Chicago, told the Standard he moved to London in 2001 He said: “He was always a kind man but with the birth of his son he’d just started to take life seriously. \n“He worked for his son and his wife, wanted to provide the best for them, and he really tried, working a very dangerous job.” \nDanut said he grown up with Mr Bulbuc before they both left Romania after leaving school. \nHe said: “I’m still shocked to hear about this horrible tragedy, I’m speechless. Police cordoned off the road after the accident (@charliebrenland) \n“He was a loving, hard-working father who loved his wife and son. I really hope this is a nightmare and I’m still waiting to wake up.” \nMr Bulbuc’s younger brother Ioan, 27, also a tree surgeon, said he had worked in the industry for around a decade. \nHe said that their parents, who had recently visited the house they shared in Beckton, east London, were struggling with the news of their eldest son’s death. \nA spokesman for the HSE said it was aware of the death and officers are assisting the Met in their investigation.
