Kings have had recent discussions with New Orleans on Cousins, sources tell @TheVertical . Sac still debating Cousins' future internally. \n— Adrian Wojnarowski (@WojVerticalNBA) February 19, 2017 Sources: Pelicans and Kings have discussed a DeMarcus Cousins trade for Buddy Hield and multiple Pelicans first-round draft picks. \n— Michael Scotto (@MikeAScotto) February 19, 2017 \nNew Orleans, who’s hosting the 2017 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday night, has been linked to several centers in trade rumors over the last few months. \nAn upgrade at center would allow the Pelicans to move superstar big man Anthony Davis to power forward, which is his natural position. \nThe Pelicans have failed to surround Davis with enough talent to contend since they drafted him No. 1 overall in 2012, but adding a player of Cousins’ caliber would give them a legit chance of earning a playoff spot in the Western Conference. \nNew Orleans will exit the All-Star break just 2.5 games behind the Denver Nuggets for the eighth and final playoff spot. \nThumbnail photo via Kelley L Cox/USA TODAY Sports Images More Stories ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T06:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T08:42:30.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
