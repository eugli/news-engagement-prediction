This proved to be false. \nA Special Task Force on Organised Crime (Stafoc) team was deployed overnight at the mortuary because of the high-profile nature of the case. \nOn the fate of the four North Korean suspects who are believed to have fled the country following Jong-nam’s assassination, Nur Jazlan said it would depend on the identification of the victim and cause of death. \n“If the death was under suspicious circumstances, the police can request for the four men to be extradited to assist in investigations,” he said. \nNur Jazlan said any request for the men to be extradited would need North Korea’s cooperation. \n“The question is whether North Korea will entertain us. What if they (North Korea) say they can’t find the four, then what can we do?” \nPolice here have requested Interpol to help trace the four. Their photographs were also published. \nInspector-General of Police Tan Sri Khalid Abu Bakar said no family member had yet come forward to claim Jong-nam’s body. \nKhalid was refuting a report in a South Korean news portal’s Arirang that Han-sol had arrived at the HKL mortuary yesterday morning and confirmed his father’s body. \n“Don’t listen to such rumours,” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:33:55.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
