The Gunners have lost three of their last five matches, against Watford, Chelsea and a 5-1 thumping at the hands of Bayern Munich in the Champions League, and have pinned their hopes of silverware on the FA Cup. With Arsenal sitting 10 points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea and facing elimination from European competition, Wenger's future at the Emirates has been called into question. However Nasri, who spent three full seasons under Wenger before leaving for Manchester City, believes it is the players who must take responsibility. \"You cannot criticise a guy like Wenger -It's impossible, Nasri told Sky Sports . \"Arsenal were a big club but he made themeven bigger. \"I think people need to be fair, it's not his fault that Arsenal are in the position they are, it's the players. It's the players on the pitch that get the results. \"There are a lot of things happening at Arsenal -the board, the players - they need to be checked, not just Arsene.\" View photos ARSENAL GOALSCORER NASRI More Nasri left north London in favour of Manchester City and secured two Premier League titles and a League Cup with the Etihad club, though he is currently plying his trade on loan at Sevilla in La Liga. The Frenchman insists it was Wenger who gave him confidence and belief at Arsenal, and that many players owe the manager for his tutelage. \"It's hard for me to say anything about him because I owe him a lot,\" said Nasri. \"I came to the Premier League because of him, I had a good career because of him because he gave me confidence and he made me a better player. \"I think all the players that have played under him, when they leave they become better players so I don't think it's him.\" Reblog ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T16:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:48:28.168+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
