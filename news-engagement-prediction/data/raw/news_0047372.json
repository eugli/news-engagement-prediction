He may have struggled at United, but Shaw is still a long way from the flops on this list... \nDespite his apparent indifference to the young left-back, however, Mourinho has today stated that Shaw's future remains at Old Trafford and that he has no plans to sell the Â£30m man. \n\"No, no, no. He will be here for sure, that is out of the question. \n\"What I think is that he had a very ugly injury, really, really ugly and the fact is not just the physical point of view but also the mental impact on him. \n\"So this season he has had a couple of small injuries and he needs to adapt. He knows what I like in a defender.\" Shaw has struggled since returning from last season's horrific leg break. Image: PA \nIt seems as though the current campaign has been a larger learning process than Shaw expected but potentially one that could benefit him in the long run. Mourinho appears to finally be getting the best out of United's previously erratic defence, with the likes of Rojo and Phil Jones looking a million miles from the nervy pair that so many Red Devils fans dreaded seeing paired together when Chris Smalling and Eric Bailly were struck down with injuries. \nMaybe some time under Jose's learning tree will revive Shaw's career in a similar manner?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T03:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T04:28:16.023+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
