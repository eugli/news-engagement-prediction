But it is not due for completion until October, 2018. CHRIS SKELTON/FAIRFAX NZ \n\"There doesn't always seem to be a reason for the traffic apart from at Takanini,\" Bob Mitchell said. \nIn the meantime commuting pain has become acute. \nREAD MORE: CHRIS MCKEEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nCity bound lane construction work limiting drivers to 80km often slows Southern Motorway traffic to a crawl. \nNew Zealand Transport Agency figures show the morning rush hour commute on the 30km from Drury to Greenlane has jumped by 22 minutes since 2012. \nGetting home is worse, the trip time for the same Greenlane to Drury stretch has nearly doubled from 24 to 46 minutes. \nAdding up those minutes each week day, the average commuter will spend more than 12 days a year stuck behind the wheel on that part of the southern. BEVAN READ/stuff.co.nz \nWaikato native Brooke Bath takes on Auckland's Northern Motorway commute. \nMercer resident Bob Mitchell said the stretch between Papakura and East Tamaki usually takes him 30 minutes but can take 90 minutes. \n\"There doesn't always seem to be a reason for the traffic apart from at Takanini. \n\"Manukau in particular is an absolute nightmare!\"â€‹ \nPokeno resident Natalie Owen said some days it takes 90 minutes alone to reach East Tamaki when she's driving to Takapuna, on Auckland's North Shore or worse. \n\"It can take two hours to get to Takapuna. The main problems start at Drury, really bad at Takanini and can last all the way through to the bridge.\" \nAt Takanini, an extra lane is being added to both the north and southbound motorways. CHRIS MCKEEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nWorks where Great South Rd meets State Highway 1 at Takanini. \nAuckland-based Stuff journalist Brooke Bath, who frequently travels to and from Hamilton, makes sure she's \"on the road by 4am\" when returning to the city on Mondays. \n\"This is purely because traffic starts by 5.30am on the southern [motorway], I wouldn't dare drive up between then and 9am if I want to keep my sanity. \n\"I find the usual hot spots on the southern are at Greenlane and Manukau, Manukau in particular.\" CHRIS MCKEEN/FAIRFAX NZ \nNZTA is spending $268 million on the Southern Corridor Improvement Project. \nAn additional lane is being added southbound where SH20 connects to SH1. \nBath is sceptical about the long term benefits of adding extra lanes. \n\"I doubt the new road layouts currently under construction will make it any easier, I believe it will be just enough to cope with the volume of traffic the southern constantly has,\" Bath said. Get more out of Auckland, sign up for the So Auckland Newsletter \nNZTA highways manager Brett Gliddon said additional delays from works are believed to be due to the narrower lanes and a reduced speed limit of 80km. \n\"These have been put in place to allow construction work to take place safely while ensuring the same number of lanes stay open to traffic,\" he said. \"The project team is working hard to have as little impact as possible on road users, and we know this work is causing some short term disruption. \"We wish we could avoid that but we have to balance the short term delays with the long term benefits of creating extra lanes to ease bottlenecks,\" Gliddon said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:38:47.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
