In the surrounding streets of Cape Town, police and hundreds of members of the military patrolled to guard against protesters who want Zuma to quit. \nSecurity teams were eventually called into the chamber to remove red-clad members of the opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), some of whom scuffled with guards.

Some members of the ruling African National Congress party heckled them as they left. \n“Out! Out!” they shouted. \n“Finally,” said a laughing Zuma, who then started an annual address on the economy and other national matters.

Some ANC members blame Zuma’s scandals for the party’s poor performance in local elections in August, in which it lost control of several key metropolitan areas. \nCritics condemned an announcement by Zuma’s office that 441 members of the military would assist police in maintaining order during the speech and the opening of parliament. The military has previously been deployed for the event, but the security operation was among the largest in recent years.
