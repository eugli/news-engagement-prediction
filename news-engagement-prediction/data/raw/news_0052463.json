Read More Wealthy car dealer who murdered wife is now being sued by his sons for £1.5m \nNow three senior judges at the Court of Appeal have backed Ben, 27, Nicholas, 23, and Susan’s sister, Carol Forrester. \nThe 63-year-old killer, who is serving life, was ordered to pay out £1,503,579, plus an estimated £500,000 in legal costs bills. \nWorkman had refused to co-operate with the legal process or obey court orders and had forfeited his right to defend himself, the judges ruled. \nSaid to have been worth about £3.3 million, Workman killed his 55-year-old wife following a frenzied row at the family home in Edgworth, near Bolton . \nHe stabbed her through the heart with a large kitchen knife in April 2011 as they rowed about their divorce, in which she was claiming £1.5 million. \nBut the cash stayed in Workman’s coffers after he was convicted of her murder at Preston Crown Court in December 2011. Ben and Nick Workman Storm Doris to hit Greater Manchester with winds of up to 80mph \nDuring his trial, Workman insisted he acted in self defence after his wife came at him with a kitchen knife. \nBut jurors disbelieved him and his conviction challenge was turned down by the Criminal Appeal Court in 2014. \nThe jury heard poignant extracts from Susan’s diary - with the last entry penned just instants before the killing. \nThe log - titled “Sue’s Memories” - recorded how her ex stormed into the house to retrieve his “clothes and jumpers”. \nWorkman briefly stroked the family dog, the diary notes, but then launched a torrent of screaming expletives at Mrs Workman. \nHer last unfinished line read simply, “standing, staring at me acro...” Read More \nAfter Workman’s trial, Ben and Nicholas put their names to a family statement welcoming “this man”s conviction.” \n“Sue did not deserve to have her life ended this way for greed and money,” they said. \nWorkman has always insisted that he didn’t kill his wife for the money and accused Ben and Nicholas of treating him “unfairly and oppressively”. \nHowever, the brothers and Mrs Forrester, who sued on behalf of her dead sister’s estate, were determined to stop him profiting from his crime. \nTheir lawyers said Workman “would have been ordered to pay his wife some £1.5m” had she not died before she could divorce him. Susan Workman Man who killed tragic mum was one of the ringleaders in Strangeways riots \nJudgment for £1,503,579 was entered against Workman in 2013 after he failed to comply with court asset freezing orders. \nStephen Killalea QC said he had made “no attempt at all” to reveal the true extent of his wealth and didn’t deserve a chance to defend himself. \nThe court also heard that Workman had “voluntarily dissipated virtually all his assets” to his eldest son, Grant, 28, who had “stuck by him”. \nWorkman’s obstruction of the legal process had led to “horrendous delays” and caused “intense emotional strain” to Ben and Nicholas, he added. \nLord Justice McCombe said today that it was “well-known rule of law” that murderers must not profit from their crimes.

His final costs bill is expected to top £500,000.
