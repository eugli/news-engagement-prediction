SIGN UP NOW > \nPaddy McCartin, the club’s 2014 number one draft pick, is also expected to play, having endured a difficult 2016 when he suffered from multiple concussions and a late-season broken collarbone. \"He’ll play,\" Cox said. \nBut it is in defence where St Kilda will have the most significant change, with Carlisle and Brown filling key defensive posts. Carlisle, disciplined by the Saints for an incident in which he filmed himself snorting a substance in Las Vegas (just prior to being traded), missed the duration of the 2016 season because of the doping bans on 34 current and former Essendon players. \nThe Saints plan to deploy Carlisle in front of Brown, playing in a centre half-back-like spot where his intercept marking will be effective, while Brown is slated to be on the last line at fullback. \nThe only regular senior player unavailable for the first pre-season game is veteran Leigh Montagna, whom the Saints say has had a slight calf problem and will not be risked. \nFormer Collingwood speedster Nathan Freeman, who has literally been hamstrung throughout his career at Collingwood and St Kilda, will not play this week, though Cox said Freeman was fit and training, but a hip problem had prevented him from playing in the last intra-club game and he needed a little more time. \nThe incident involving Carlisle in Las Vegas from the post-season of 2015 greatly disappointed the Saints, but the club says the talented former Bomber has impressed with his attitude and training and won the trust of his team mates after his troubled arrival at St Kilda. \nThe Saints have few injuries to date this year. Cox said 35 players from their list had completed 80 per cent of pre-season training thus far.
