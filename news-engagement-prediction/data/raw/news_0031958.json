Photo: Supplied \n\"A number of survivors gave evidence to the royal commission that they believed they were either shared by their abusers or that there was awareness between their abusers of each other's conduct,\" the report found. \n.Louis Daniels, a former Anglican priest convicted of multiple sexual offences against young boys, said the culture of the CEBS allowed the potential for sexual abuse. \n\"Daniels . . said the camps provided an 'opportunity' to those attracted to children and when asked to describe the culture of CEBS, said 'a boys' society, unless it is carefully managed, is a sitting duck' to potential offenders,\" the report found. \nSystemic problems identified by the commissioners include the minimisation of alleged offending with one victim being told by his parish priest, the late Reverend Boak Jobbins, to \"let sleeping dogs lie\" and \"not proceed\" with a complaint against Simon Jacobs who led CEBS groups in Pymble and St Ives in Sydney in the 1970s and 80s. \nIn 2010, Jacobs pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, 11 child sexual abuse offences involving seven male victims. \nThe commissioners found allegations were not \"reported to the police either at all or in a timely way\" and there was a \"focus on protecting the reputation of the church, dioceses, CEBS and individual clergy\". \nPeter Hollingworth was criticised in the report for allowing a priest who was the subject of abuse allegations to continue in the ministry. \n\"We are satisfied that Dr Hollingworth's decision to permit Elliot to continue in the ministry was a serious error of judgment which focused overly on Elliot's needs to the exclusion . . . of the need to protect children more generally,\" the report found. \nBlue Knot Helpline 1300 657 380.
