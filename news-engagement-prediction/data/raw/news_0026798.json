Rapper ScHoolboy Q arrived on the Grammy’s red carpet Sunday night with his daughter Joy , both clad in pink power outfits. Joy wouldn’t be the only pint-sized attendee to make a statement in a pink suit— Blue Ivy Carter made the same choice, and could be seen standing in the front row next to Joy later in the evening— but Joy was the only one with a dad dressed to match. Joy, who sported a pink Gucci suit, was at the ceremony supporting her father, who’s nominated for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Album. He, in turn, showed support for women everywhere (especially his daughter) with a pink sweatshirt that read, “Girl Power.” On Instagram, he wrote, “New Gucci Collection” on the photo of his posing daughter. As recently as three days ago, there were reports that ScHoolboy Q would not show up for the ceremony (he skipped it last year). In an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1, he told Lowe that he might not come to the ceremony, unless his daughter wanted to. It looks like Joy’s vote won out, and the duo made an adorable pro-woman statement.
