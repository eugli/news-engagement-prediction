Read More \nNow he has been locked up for seven years by a judge who said he had created “a real and grave risk of death” to those sleeping in the flats above. Gerard Connor, 43, was jailed for three counts of arson \nHis arson spree began at the apartment block, on Advent Way, on the outskirts of the city centre in the early hours of Friday October 28. \nConnor got into the basement car park of the fully occupied block, which contains 32 two-bedroom apartments and was seen on CCTV at around 1am. \nHe was carrying a plastic bag containing lighters, combustible materials and possibly even an accelerant such as petrol, the court was told. The scene of the fire at The Cube on Advent Way, Ancoats \nIt is believed he started the fire either underneath or in the grill of a black Ford Focus belonging to one of the residents. \nAt around 1.40am residents were woken from their beds by smoke alarms going off on the second floor of the six-storey building.

The entire building was evacuated after residents were woken by fire alarms at around 1.40am \nFlames also lapped up the side of the building and the court was shown photographs of huge black scorch marks on the exterior of the building, also captured by the M.E.N the following morning. \nThankfully no one was injured but an estimated £250,000 worth of damage was caused to the building, Simone Flynn prosecuting said. Read More \nHe also lit two more fires that night in two other city centre car parks. The scene of the fire in the car park of the Ancoats flats \nShortly before 3am a small blaze was started underneath a plastic cleaning sign at the NCP car park on Chatham Street. \nConnor was seen on CCTV kneeling down and using items from his plastic bag to start it and he sat and watched it melt the sign and burn the floor around it before fleeing. \nThen at around 3.20am he torched a Fiat 500 in the NCP car park on Whitworth Street causing it to explode and leaving the motor worth £5,500 a complete write-off. \nThe car park was open at the time and “anyone stood nearby or returning to their car could have been walked into the field of the blast” Mrs Flynn said. One of the other fires started by Connor on the same night - at the NCP car park on the corner of Chatham Street and Piccadilly \nConnor, a habitual thief with 80 previous convictions, was identified and linked to all the offences after a police officer recognised him from the CCTV footage. \nConnor, of no fixed abode, initially denied starting the blaze at The Cube when he was arrested the following day. \nHowever he pleaded guilty to three counts of Arson being reckless as to whether life was endangered at Manchester Crown Square on Friday. The fire Connor started in the basement of the Palace Theatre car park \nHe also admitted the theft of two cars a fortnight before the fires, a Ford Focus from the driveway of a house in Beswick, and a £7,000 Vauxhall Astra from the same car park at the Cube where he started the huge blaze. The vehicle was found abandoned nearby a short time later. \nCannabis and heroin addict Connor told officers on his arrest after the fires that he “wanted to get nicked” as he was sick of living on the streets after coming out of prison just weeks earlier. \nHowever he now says he was high on a mixture of alcohol and the potent former legal high and now banned substance Spice.
