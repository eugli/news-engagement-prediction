Mesut Ozil suffering CRISIS of confidence, admits Arsenal boss Wenger \nThat goal sparked Burnley – and their supporters – into life and they could have gone 2-1 up minutes later were Andre Gray’s cross converted by one of his teammates. \nThe Clarets could have scored again when Lowton was then put through on goal in the 36 th minute by an incisive Joey Barton through ball, but Courtois made a crucial save with his feet. \nIf Chelsea thought there would be any let up from Burnley’s relentlessness then they were quickly reminded why the hosts have such a formidable record at home with Gray nearly scoring within minutes of the second-half after capitalising on a limping David Luiz’s mistake, only to be stopped once again by the excellent Courtois.
