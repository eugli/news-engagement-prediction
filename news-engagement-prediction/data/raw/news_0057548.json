Foo Fighters – rumoured The rumour that Foo Fighters will be reclaiming the headline slot they had to give up in 2015 is looking increasing valid. In the early hours of Thursday morning some fans were contacted by the band to attend a show at the Cheese and Grain pub in Froome, where it is expected that the band will announce that they are headlining the festival.\nAnyone doubting any foo fighters news there's your answer @TheGlastoThingy pic.twitter.com/sd61nQcxIq \n— Man With Beard (@RyanHudson2009) February 23, 2017 T he Twitter user, Ryan Hudson, was one of the recipients of \"boarding passes\" for the band's Obelisk Airlines website, which launched on Wednesday and shows a mock departure board with their forthcoming gigs. One, thought to be later revealed as for Glastonbury, is shown as \"pending\" with a string of nonsense letters after the first two of \"GL\". \n\nOn December 15, The Sun reported that Foo Fighters would be headlining Glastonbury on the Sunday night. The story has not been officially confirmed.\nThis one isn't so far-fetched considering the US rockers were forced to cancel their headline slot in 2015 after Dave Grohl broke his leg while performing live on stage in Sweden, just weeks before their Glastonbury performance.\nFlorence + the Machine stepped in as their replacement , but fans have long-expected the band to make good on their promise to rock the Pyramid Stage and were disappointed they didn't appear on 2016's line-up.\nHowever, in the following days weekend the band revealed they will be coming to Europe in the form of a tantalising map of the continent tweeted from their official Twitter account.\nThey also confirmed their first headline festival slot of 2017 – Portugal's NOS Alive on July 7. Could Glastonbury also be on the cards? It's highly probable.\nUnfinished business: Will the Foo Fighters honour their cancelled 2015 booking after Dave Grohl broke his leg? Credit: Rex Radiohead – confirmed I t's been almost 20 years since their legendary 1997 Pyramid Stage outing, and what better way to mark the anniversary with another iconic performance in 2017? Festival organisers used the BBC's Glastonbury webcam to announce the first headline act of Radiohead – by slowly revealing a replica of the band's logo beside the half-constructed Pyramid stage at the site in Somerset . \nThe ground composition took two days to complete, but eagle-eyed fans spotted early on the shape taking form bore a remarkable resemblance to the bear symbol used by Radiohead to promote their 2000 album, Kid A. The following day, the festival confirmed its first headline act via its official Twitter feed.\nAside from a surprise appearance in one of the festival's 'special guest' slots on the Park Stage in 2011 , Radiohead last played Glastonbury in 2003 with a spine-tingling headline slot on the Friday night.\nFans – somewhat frustrated by the band's infrequent live performances – have waited a long time to see Radiohead return to the Pyramid Stage. And it would seem even the band themselves are just as excited.\nIn a recent interview broadcast on BBC 6 Music about the band potentially being asked back to play on their 20th anniversary of their 1997 appearance, Radiohead's Ed O'Brien said: \"I would love to, I mean I go to Glastonbury every year, it’s my carnival, to be asked to play at Glastonbury again would be magic.\"\nWelcome return: Radiohead are to headline at Worthy Farm in 2017 Credit: AFP Ed Sheeran – rumoured T he singer has made no secret of his desire to perform at the festival in recent years – and, if recent events are anything to go by, he just might get his wish in 2017.\nOn December 15, The Sun reported that Sheeran would be headlining the Pyramid Stage on Saturday night , although the story has not yet been confirmed by the singer's representatives or by the festival organisers.\nAnd in an intriguing turn of events back in November, betting was suspended on the singer headlining the festival next year after a flurry of bets.\nBookmaker Ladbrokes said his odds of headlining dropped from 7/1 to 1/3 after bets were placed \"at a rate of knots\".\nLife imitating art? Since Sheeran's Glastonbury cameo in the new Bridget Jones film, all bets are off of a 2017 appearance Credit: EPA H owever, it is unclear whether this sudden flush is down to a well-placed festival source or his cameo in the new Bridget Jones film, where he is shown playing at Glastonbury.\nSheeran has been on hiatus from his music career but his third album is expected to be released in 2017, specifically January. Fans got terribly excited in December when he ended his social media hiatus a year after it began by posting a blue square to his Twitter and Instagram profiles . \nWatch | Seven surprising facts about Ed Sheeran 01:16 The Stone Roses – rumoured R umours about the band playing the festival first surfaced in 2012 and have yet to subside.\nThe Stone Roses are touring next summer but a gap in their live date schedule in June could accommodate a set at Glastonbury, which is what sparked this new wave of speculation among evangelical fans.\nInitially, their were \"strong reports\" of the band grabbing the Friday headline slot, but since it has now been revealed Radiohead are to occupy this space the rumour mill now believes they will close the festival on Sunday instead.\nHowever, this gossip was scotched by Emily Eavis in an interview last month.\nLong time coming: The Stone Roses have a Glastonbury-shaped hole in their live date schedule next summer Credit: Dave J Hogan/Getty Fleetwood Mac – rumoured T his iconic band is on the wish list of the high priest of Glastonbury himself, but as much as Michael Eavis would like to see them perform at his festival he said he \"can't afford\" to bring Fleetwood Mac to Worthy Farm.\nStill, this hasn't stopped mounting speculation that Stevie Nicks and co will grace one of the main stages with a headline slot in 2017. \nEver since the band's comeback in 2013, fans believe they would be a perfect fit for the 'golden oldie' Sunday afternoon slot on the Pyramid Stage.\nHowever, if organisers do decide to shell out for the band they may prefer to get their money's worth with a more prominent outing in the form of a headline slot.\nCould the price be right for a Fleetwood Mac festival triumph? Daft Punk – rumoured L ike Radiohead, Daft Punk played the festival nearly 20 years ago in 1997 – and apparently this is enough to spark rumours of an \"anniversary\" headline slot in 2017.\nAnd, like Radiohead, they have also popped up for an unannounced surprise set.\nTalk of a 2017 world tour has added fuel to the rumours, but Emily Eavis flat-out denied they were coming back to headline at Worthy Farm, two decades after they conquered the dance tent. \nDon't be Daft: Could the French dance duo be planning a 20th anniversary Glastonbury comeback? Credit: Karl Walter/Getty Lady Gaga – rumoured A tight-lipped response from the Poker Face singer appears to have dropped the biggest hint yet that she will return to Worthy Farm in 2017.\nWhen asked in an interview whether she would be performing at Glastonbury, Lady Gaga said: \"I don’t have permission to say anything about that\".\nShe also winked at another reporter who asked her the same question. That's good enough for us.\nThe time is ripe for a Gaga return: her theatrical 2009 performance on the Other Stage went down a storm and she has promised a return to her avant-garde, absurd best after finishing a string of stripped-back live shows. In February, she astonished millions of television viewers with a bombastic performance during the Super Bowl Halftime show. \nCould the avant-garde absurdist star be returning to Glastonbury? Kasabian – rumoured T hey triumphantly closed the festival in 2014 and anyone who has seen Kasabian 's live shows know the band is more than capable of handling a stage – and a crowd – of that size with ease.\nBut would they return to a headline slot so (relatively) soon after their last Glastonbury appearance?\nIt seems unlikely, but the band are thought to be releasing a new album in 2017 so they could pop up somewhere – even if it's on a smaller stage or in a different time slot.\nNo strangers to the Pyramid Stage: Tom Meighan from Kasabian Kraftwerk – rumoured A summer of live shows + a conveniently shaped Glastonbury hole in the schedule = wild speculation.\nKraftwerk fans believe the band have inadvertently dropped their biggest clue yet that they will be playing the festival – by revealing something without actually saying anything.\nThe electro pioneers' UK tour conveniently ends just as the festivities kick off at Worth Farm. Which of course must mean they will be heading to Somerset shortly after. Maybe.\nIf they do put in an appearance, 2017 would be their Glastonbury debut.\nGlastonbury virgins: Will Kraftwerk pop their Pilton cherry? Depeche Mode – rumoured T he band themselves responded to Glastonbury gossip by saying an appearance is not \"out of the question\" – but added a slot could be tricky in 2017 due to other appearances.\nStill, while unlikely, they haven't officially ruled themselves out so they can remain on the list until we hear otherwise.\nWatch | A guide to Glastonbury festival 01:00 The 50 best Glastonbury performances", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:47:58.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
