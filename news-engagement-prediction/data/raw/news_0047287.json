By definition, they've become the very thing they're working so terribly hard to defeat: god damned fascists. \nA mindset of intolerance has been normalized amongst the left, promoted by the media, even accepting violence in order to 'stomp out' nazis and white supremacists. \nThe bullshit has to end. They can't keep getting away with it. \nContent originally generated at iBankCoin.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:53:01.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
