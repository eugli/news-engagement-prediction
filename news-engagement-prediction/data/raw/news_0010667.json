New England Patriots' Tom Brady Credit: AP \nThe biggest game in American sports was a star-studded event from start to finish. \nThe coin toss was conducted by a frail-looking former US President George Bush Sr and his wife Barbara, making their first public appearance since being admitted to hospital last month. \nPresident Bush’s involvement followed the American national anthem, sung by country music star Luke Ryan and a song from the hit Broadway musical Hamilton, performed by stars from the cast. \nVice President Mike Pence, who last year was booed by the audience of Hamilton , also attended the game. Lady Gaga stole the show Credit: AP \nThe half-time show, traditionally a sign that a performer has achieved superstardom, saw an extraordinary spectacle from Lady Gaga. \nDespite her known opposition to the Trump presidency, Gaga did not use the showcase event to make any political statements. \nInstead, the New York born singer began her performance on the roof of Houston’s NRG Stadium with a medley of patriotic songs and recited lines from the American Pledge of Allegiance, before descending into the Stadium by rope. \nSinging hits including Poker Face, Born This Way, and Bad Romance, Gaga dazzled with a series of costumes and flanked by a gyrating group of dancers. The star even shouted out to her parents during Million Reasons and went down into the fans, hugging several. \nSorry, this content isn't available on your device. \nSorry, this content isn't available on your device. \nSorry, this content isn't available on your device. \nSorry, this content isn't available on your device. What is the Super Bowl? \nShe finished the half-time show by jumping off the stage to catch a football thrown towards her. \nThe six-time Grammy winner’s turn attracted almost universal approval, with American sports blog SB Nation describing her show as “electric”, while Cyndi Lauper tweeted, “Was so good I cried”. \nGaga’s performance and the Super Bowl itself attracted a host of celebrity interest, including Patriot’s quarterback Tom Brady’s model wife Giselle Bundchen, who was in the NRG Stadium to see her husband make history. \nSir Elton John, Usher, John Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen, Mark Wahlberg, and former England footballer Rio Ferdinand were among those celebrities at the game. \nAway from the stadium, the Super Bowl’s commercial breaks are among the most expensive slots globally for television adverts. Former President George H W Bush and wife, Barbara, arrive on the field for a coin toss Credit: AP \nHalf-time performer Lady Gaga appeared in a lavish advert for the jewellery chain Tiffany’s, while Melissa McCarthy starred in a tongue-in-cheek, environmentally-inspired advert for Kia. \nNetflix’s acclaimed original series Stranger Things also saw its second series trailed. Budweiser’s ‘Born The Hard Way’ advert , which tells the story of a fictional German immigrant, was politically contentious, with critics like Sarah Palin attacking its supposedly pro-immigrant stance. 84 Lumber’s advert ‘The Journey’ has also attracted some controversy and the company were forced to cancel their origin ad as it was considered too political. \nIt wasn’t all serious, though, as Kirsten Schaal’s flirtatious T-Mobile advert showed that humour is still the preferred approach for the heavy hitter in Super Bowl adverts.
