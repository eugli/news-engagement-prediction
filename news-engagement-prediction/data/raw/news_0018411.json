Tata trusts and gro up companies which hold the controlling stake as well as sections of the Tata clan voted in favour of the resolution. \n\nHowever, a few members of the family abstained. Mistry himself stayed away but, through a proxy, voted against the resolution. Ratan Tata 's brother Jimmy Tata, Piloo Minocher Tata (wife of a grandnephew of group founder Jamsetji Tata) and her children -Jimmy M Tata and Vera Farhad Choksey -were among those who abstained. \n\nNoel Tata (step-brother of Ratan and Jimmy Tata and brother-in-law of Cyrus Mistry) and his mother Simone Tata backed the resolution which was moved by four Tata Sons shareholders: JRD Tata Trust, Tata Education Trust, Tata Social Welfare Trust and R D Tata Trust. The MK Tata Trust (Piloo Tata is a trustee here), Maharaja Virendra Singh Chauhan, Tata Industries , Tata International and Tata Investment Corporation were the other shareholders who abstained. \n\nMaharaja Virendra Singh Chauhan owned one share of Tata Sons but after he passed away , the ownership of this share along with some of his other assets are currently under dispute. The three Tata companies mentioned above could not vote as the law does not permit subsidiaries to participate in any resolution concerning their parent. In short, about 2.6% (10,367 shares) of total voting rights was not enfranchised. \n\nMistry and his family hold 18.4% (74,352 shares) in Tata Sons.With Mistry voted out, it brings to an end his family's decades-old representation on the board. \n\nMistry became a director of Tata Sons in 2006 after his father retired from the company . Though the family does not have a right to a board seat, it was given a non-executive directorship to acknowledge its sizeable stake in the Tata Sons.Sources close to Mistry said that the family has no plans to sell their shares despite the latest development. Firms that represent Mistry had sought to stall the EGM by filing a petition before the quasi-judicial National Company Law Tribunal citing oppression of minority shareholder rights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T11:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:32:30.844+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
