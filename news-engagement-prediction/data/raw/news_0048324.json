She has perfect feet and perfect hands. She has perfect kidneys, perfect lungs and a perfect liver. Sadly, she doesn't have a perfect brain,” Mrs Young wrote on Facebook.\n“We found out recently she has anencephaly and is terminal. Faced with terrible options we have decided to continue the pregnancy to full term so Eva, which literally means life, can grow strong and give life to multiple people through organ donation. \nKeri Young and her husband Royce Credit: Keri Young/ Facebook “This was not an easy decision. For the next 20 weeks I will feel her kick, have the hiccups and we'll be able to hear her perfect heart beating all while knowing we'll only get a few short hours with her when she's born.”\nD octors told the couple that the baby’s heart valves could be donated to someone who needed them, along with her kidneys, liver and possibly her pancreas. Her lungs could also be donated for scientific research. \nIn a series of Facebook posts, Mrs Young describes how she and her husband wrestled with the decision. \n“The reality of feeling her kick for 20 weeks was very much settling in. Strangers excitedly asking me about my stomach and friends not knowing how to treat us was devastating to think about,” Mrs Young wrote.\nKeri Young and her husband Royce went for an ultra-sound scan at 19 weeks to find out their baby’s sex but were devastated to learn that the child had a terminal condition known as anencephaly.

Decision made. We were continuing on with the pregnancy. Eva will have life even though it will be short. She'll donate anything she can and do more in her time on earth than I ever will,” Mrs Young wrote. \nThe baby is due on May 7. \nMrs Young wrote: “This is not over for us. We'll almost assuredly have doubts on if we're actually doing the right thing. Or if we can even handle this. May 7th is far away. Please continue to think and pray for us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:25:56.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
