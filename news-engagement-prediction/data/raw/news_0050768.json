Supermodel isn't her usual fashionable self as she sports grillz and oversized knitwear The supermodel sported an unusual look as she partied at a London nightclub Share Kendall Jenner isn't as stylish as usual (Photo: Splash) Share Get celebs   \nKendall Jenner is usually effortlessly-stylish. \nBut the supermodel showed off a bit of an odd look as she went out partying in London on Monday night. \nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians star is in town for London Fashion Week and headed out to make the most of her trip across the pond. \nThe 21-year-old was spotted on a night out with pals, including fellow model Lily Donaldson, at the city's Cirque Le Soir Night Club - but she wasn't her usual fashionable self.
