FACEBOOK \nThe 36-year-old was found on Sunday night. \nShe had not been heard from since – until Sunday night, when a member of the public recognised Crooks on a track in Punakaiki on the West Coast and called emergency services about 7pm. \nSpeaking from his Opotiki home, Crooks' father John said the family were leaving for the West Coast. \n\"We are in a really good space at the moment; we are really grateful for everything really. \n\"At this stage we don't know anything more than we knew last time apart from she's been found and we are just all grateful for it.\" \nThe last six weeks had been \"terrible\". \n\"Just getting sightings everywhere sort of put us off the track of where she was.\" Ad Feedback \nCrooks was receiving medical treatment in Christchurch Hospital. Police were waiting to speak to her. \nCrooks has four children – 5-year-old twins, an 11-year-old and a 12-year-old. The children live with other family members. \nThree weeks after her disappearance, John Crooks said his daughter enjoyed tramping and hunting and was capable of living without electricity. \nHowever, it was unusual for her to be completely out of touch with him and her seven siblings, and he was concerned she had not used her bank account or phone. \nPunakaiki Beach Camp worker Jed Findlay said Crooks stayed with them in the small town between Westport and Greymouth, though the date of her stay was not clear. \n\"She stayed with us just for one night. I don't remember her. It's hard to remember we have so many people staying with us,\" he said. \nLast month, police appealed for sightings of Crooks around State Highway 6 near the Westport/Inangahua intersection on December 24. \nThey had also asked drivers of white sedans travelling in the area to come forward. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:33:09.433+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
