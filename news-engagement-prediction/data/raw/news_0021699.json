The Bombay High Court’s Aurangabad Bench on Monday ordered deletion of four scenes from the film, which it held were defamatory to the judiciary and could amount to contempt of court. The High Court order came following a report by the court-appointed three-member committee of experts, comprising Senior Advocates R.N. Dhorde and V.J. Dixit and medico Prakash Kanade. The Aurangabad bench set up the committee to see the film after a Nanded lawyer, Ajay Kumar Waghmare, told the court that the film was an attempt to portray the country’s legal profession and the judicial system in a poor light. While keeping the plea by Fox Star Studios pending, the top court had on February 3 asked the producer of the film to go back to the High Court to raise objections to the appointment of the three member committee for pre-release viewing of the film.
