I know it doesn’t feel like it today or every day, but you’re winning,” she said. “Very soon, we will win full freedom nationwide, and it’s going to be with bipartisan support. You can help by checking out the National Center for Transgender Equality and letting Washington hear you loud and clear.” \n“Now, I have a message for the bullies,” Jenner continued. “You’re sick, and because you’re weak, you pick on kids, you pick on women or anyone else you think is vulnerable. Apparently even becoming the attorney general isn’t enough to cure some people of their insecurities. As proof, the Supreme Court will soon hear a very important Title IX case thanks to the courage of a very brave young man, Gavin Grimm. Mr. President, we’ll see you in court.” \nLastly, she reiterated her message to the president himself. \n“Finally, I have a message for President Trump,” she said. “From, well, one Republican to another, this is a disaster, and you can still fix it. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me.” \nThere are no comments yet. Be the first to post your thoughts.
