Ms. Harrison’s victory was a setback for the Labour Party. Credit Phil Noble/Reuters LONDON — For decades, voters in Copeland, in the northwest of England, have elected parliamentary candidates from Britain’s opposition Labour Party so regularly that their support was almost taken for granted. That came to an abrupt end early on Friday, when a candidate from the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Theresa May took the seat in a by-election, delivering a setback to a Labour Party that is trailing in the polls and has been split by voters’ decision in a referendum last year to leave the European Union. On a morning of mixed fortunes for Labour, there was a more encouraging result in a second contest, in Stoke-on-Trent Central, where it emerged victorious over the right-wing populist U.K. Independence Party, known as UKIP. In the process, it comfortably defeated the party’s new leader, Paul Nuttall, who had gambled by running there personally. The loss was a big reversal for Mr. Nuttall, who is trying to establish a new identity for UKIP after the party achieved its objective last year by persuading Britons to vote to quit the European Union. It has sought to appeal to voters in working-class communities who normally vote Labour. Mr. Nuttall’s failure to do so in Stoke, after a mistake-prone campaign, was a huge relief for Labour, but the loss of Copeland underscores the problems facing a party that is struggling to present itself as a credible alternative government in waiting. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In a general election in 2015, voters deserted Labour en masse in Scotland, once a Labour stronghold. In last year’s referendum, many of its traditional supporters rejected Labour’s advice to remain in the European Union. Labour’s left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has also been at war with many of his own lawmakers, some of whom tried unsuccessfully to force him out last year. Copeland had been a Labour monopoly since the creation of the parliamentary constituency in 1983, and the Conservatives had not represented the region for around 80 years. Moreover, governing parties rarely win by-elections over opposition parties; before Copeland, the last time this happened was in 1982. The Conservative candidate in Copeland, Trudy Harrison, described her win as a “truly historic event.” Photo Paul Nuttall, the leader of the right-wing populist U.K. Independence Party, after losing an election in Stoke-on-Trent Central.

Mr. Corbyn’s history of skepticism about nuclear power may have hampered his party in a region where the industry is economically crucial. The Sellafield nuclear facility is a major employer, and there are hopes of a new nuclear site at Moorside. In a statement, Mr. Corbyn described Labour’s victory in Stoke-on-Trent Central as “a decisive rejection of UKIP’s politics of division and dishonesty.” Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
