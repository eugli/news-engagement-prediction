The former couple’s case dates back to February 2016, about five months after their daughter was born. They later set a parenting plan that required them to live together, but are now “in the process of establishing separate residences,” according to paperwork obtained by the Tribune . \nChance is reportedly asking to “set a child support award below statutory guidelines.” He is also asking the court to grant an order to protect personal information, require Corley to share in paying expenses for their daughter, and refer them to private mediation. Corley’s attorney told the Tribune , “Despite the fact the matter’s back before the court, Miss Corley will continue to foster the relationship between Mr. Bennett and their child and will work towards an amicable resolution of all issues.” \nPitchfork has reached out to Chance the Rapper’s representatives for more information and comment.
