Installation process Since this is an ad-supported product, you should pay attention when installing WebcamMax. It offers to download and install some third-party components that it doesn't need in order to fully function, as well as to make some changes to your web browsers. Associate WebcamMax with several programs Once you initiate the application with the user-friendly interface, you can set WebcamMax as the default webcam for selected programs (e.g. Yahoo Messenger, Skype, YouTube). Insert effects, animations, backgrounds and emotions You can add various effects such as \"Box,\" \"Double H,\" \"Fatter,\" \"4 Grids,\" \"Pinch,\" \"Swirl,\" \"Skew Right\" and \"Thinner.\" But you can also add animations (e.g. \"Butterfly Fluttering,\" \"Cupid's Arrow\"), backgrounds (e.g. \"Animal - Dragons,\" \"Mushroom Cloud\") and emotions (e.g. \"Amazing,\" \"Heart Broken\"). Filters and scenes, snapshots and other handy options Furthermore, you can add faces, filters (e.g. film purple, emboss red, mosaic, shadow), frames (e.g. \"Animal - Monkey\", \"Batman\") and scenes (e.g. \"Mirror\", \"Newspaper\"), as well as take a snapshot, record or pause video, get more effects, open picture files to add them to the video, add Flash and subtitles, play media, enable picture-in-picture, doodle, and more. Configuration settings In the \"Options\" menu, you can set WebcamMax to automatically run at system startup and check for updates, change the interface skin and language, select webcam source rate and size, audio input and line, and others. Performance and final thought The program uses a moderate-to-high amount of system resources, displays instructions and hasn't popped up any errors during our tests. We strongly recommend WebcamMax to all users who want to have a little fun with their webcam.
