Tom Fox, 23, said he and his fellow activists intend to make a stand against rich investors leaving similar homes derelict. The squatters have access to gas, electricity, hot running water and even a WiFi account named 'Billion' and turned what was the mansion's library into a makeshift football pitch, using a DIY ball made with duct tape as a ball. WHO IS THE RUSSIAN OLIGARCH ANDREY GONCHARENKO? The property belongs to Russian oligarch Andrey Goncharenko (pictured with his wife Marina) who bought it in 2014 Russian billionaire Andrey Goncharenko is regarded as a shadowy figure even in the secretive oligarch world - with the source of his wealth unclear. He bought four landmark London properties in a £250million shopping spree over three years - including the £120million Hanover Lodge in Regent's Park. The others include 50 St James Street, Mayfair, which sold for £70million; a mansion in Lyndhurst Road, Hampstead, sold for £41million; and the Belgravia mansion currently being occupied by squatters. Despite being described as 'humourless' by one associate, Goncharenko has been spotted on the French Riviera, rubbing shoulders with the Russian elite, and has a reputation as something of a party animal. Lat week Mr Fox, who grew up in Manchester and is a qualified plumber, joked that they would leave if Mr Goncharenko gave them £50,000. He said: 'There is so much empty space and so many empty houses because people have invested in these dead assets, these stale assets. 'There are so many homeless people who need a place to stay. This place is in great condition and we have got nine or ten homeless people living here. 'There are these preconceptions that they are all crack addicts and things but many people are in this situation because they have just slipped through the net. 'There would be plenty of people willing to work as minders [for these properties], you could set up CCTV and then let the homeless in. There are people dying on the streets at the moment.' The anti-fascist group joked they will leave if oligarch Andrey Goncharenko pays them £50,000 A banner which reads 'USA Anti-Government In Exile' hangs above the front door, as well as a black flag with the words 'Antifaschistische Aktion', an Anti fascist network from continental Europe Grand opening soon.... pic.twitter.com/KVGydjJ9dC — Lauri Love (@LauriLoveX) 25 January 2017 The group of 20 (including Tom Fox and Jed Miller, who are pictured) say the homeless are welcome at the Grade II-listed home The palatial mansion is the latest of 33 high profile central London properties Mr Fox claims to have squatted in. The anarchist group set up camp in Trafalgar Square's Admiralty Arch in April 2015 and unfurled banners reading 'Homes for all'. The group gained access to the Eaton Square mansion by sliding open a basement window, then spreading the word via social media. The alleged computer hacker Laurie Love, 32, who is facing extradition to the US accused of stealing data from American intelligence agencies, has visited friends living in the squat, but did not spend an evening in the home, Mr Fox said. The house was built around 1825 by the Grosvenor family and was until recently the home of the Instituto Cervantes of London, a Spanish cultural centre. The squatters were due to appear at the Central London County Court in February but the hearing to get them removed from the property was moved up. INSIDE THE £15M HOME NOW LADEN WITH TRASH AND GRAFFITI Just hours after the court ruling, while many of the original squatters have since vacated the property, it was far from empty. The 1820s house was still occupied by various individuals, some identifying as homeless, others calling themselves political activists. One occupant, who wished to be known as Mordecai, first visited the mansion on Friday then moved in after an attack on the mansion on Saturday when masked attackers smashed windows. He says he was inspired to move in, 'to enforce the extras and support our comrades.' He said: 'Some people think, \"Oh it's a party\", but then you are talking to people and realise this guy is part of an organisation of tens of thousands of people and then this lady, she's a very serious activist. 'I think for the public it's just, you know, \"Ah, they've p***ed off the big Russian oil baron\". 'There are 1.5 million empty properties, people are dying on the streets. From my perspective it's a message to the capitalist leaders.' Fellow squatter Jess Ellis moved in the day before the court ruling to offer support to the cause. She said: 'On a day to day basis it's changed, there's been different people coming in and out. 'Basically, we're trying to raise awareness about things the system is failing on: the main one is homelessness, the second is promising people things and then it never happens. 'There's a whole variety of issues that we don't agree with that we are trying to make change from, and if it takes taking over big buildings like this then that's what we will do.' Jess, who's now in sheltered accommodation, said: 'As soon as we get evicted from here a team of us are going out to look for a new building straight away. I'm staying here until the bitter end - the bailiffs will have to tell me to leave or drag me out of here.' Everywhere there were signs of the squatters making themselves at home. The ground floor hallway is furnished with makeshift shelves, stocked with food supplies and two trestle tables, laden with more snacks and plastic bowls of fruit. The first floor is emptier, a pair of jeans and sleeping bag crumpled in one corner; in another room, a grand fireplace is decorated with graffiti with slogans like 'Pu**y', and 'Who r ur allies They're all spies', and heart-shaped drawings tacked to the white walls with masking tape. The temporary fittings contrast with the grand red carpeted staircase and black and white tiled hall floor. Occupants have plenty of rooms to choose from but in main stay on the ground and first floor. Sitting on the floor beneath windows, which have been barricaded with the property's doors, a group roll cigarettes and appear relaxed about their imminent eviction. One resident, 28-year-old Grant, came to the mansion directly from sleeping on the streets for the past 15 months. Drinking strong black coffee in the house's makeshift kitchen, complete with hotplate and microwave, Grant says his five-day stay at 102 Eaton Square is the longest he's been off drugs in the last few years. He said: 'I'm rattling. Heroin, crack, valium, pills; you name it. Anything that could take you out of your f***ing mind I took.' Prior to sleeping rough in London, Grant lived in Scotland with his wife and 10-year-old son. He said: 'I had everything, then I lost it on a binge with the drink and drugs and threw it all away. 'I had my own business, I had a house, my wife and son, a car. Grant claims that being in the squat has been a positive experience. 'It has been good - shown me that there are a lot of people wanting to help.' For Jess too the sense of community, alongside the protest, is powerful. She said: 'There's community [here]. When you're outside in the real world it's hard to get that feeling, it's hard to have that sense of belonging. 'Especially for people like us because we are what people call anti-social, reprobates, criminals protesters, annoyances, nuisances, whatever. 'We may seem like that but we have to be like this to try and change the situation for better. Not just for people like us but for people of all walks of life. 'If it takes such drastic movements like this to get the government to listen then we know we're doing it for the best.'
