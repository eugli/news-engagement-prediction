He continues: 'I thought it was crass, insensitive, selfish and pathetic. She would lie about how much she had eaten and then explode with rage if we challenged her.' Maddy began suffering with the illness during her A-levels and her father admits that he failed to grasp that his daughter had a mental illness Mark (pictured presenting ITV news) said that he once thought of the illness as 'crass, insensitive, selfish and pathetic' Maddy is now on the road to recovery but this is not the first time that Mr Austin has spoken candidly about her illness, revealing in November that she came close to organ failure. In a searingly honest radio interview, Mr Austin, 58, said the teenager dropped to five and a half stone after battling the illness. Mr Austin and his wife, an A&E doctor, tried private health care but said there was 'force-feeding' and their daughter became 'even more depressed'. They eventually resorted to caring for her at home. At her worst Maddy dropped to just five and a half stone much to the horror of her parents Sporty Maddy is now gearing up to run the London Marathon in support of the Duchess of Cambridge's mental health charity Place2Be The journalist said the NHS offered 'the best emergency health care in the world' for physical problems but warned that help for mental health was underfunded. Speaking on a mental health special of BBC Radio 4's The World At One last year, Mr Austin described how Maddy was struck with the illness while she was studying for her A-levels and she was pulled into a 'bleak, dark world of depression'. He said: 'She was basically shrinking away before our eyes. She was there, but she was gone and it all happened very quickly. Maddy, now 22, is now on the road to recovery from her illness 'We thought we were losing her so we tried to get help, but there wasn't really the help there.' He said 'within a period of four or five months' her weight dropped and she became 'very dangerously ill'. The family turned to private health care but 'that didn't work', he said. He said: 'It wasn't the kind of care we wanted for her. There was force-feeding going on. There was all sorts of stuff that was making her even more depressed. 'We pulled her out and basically looked after her ourselves. Had it not been for the fact that my wife is an A&E doctor I'm not sure what would have happened. 'She was getting close to organ failure.' Mr Austin said that the situation became more complicated when his daughter hit 18 because he was no longer able to see her medical notes. He added: 'Things were getting pretty bleak.' The presenter said the NHS offered the best emergency health care in the world for physical problems but warned that help for mental health is underfunded. He continued: 'We are heading towards an epidemic in mental health and there are not the resources there to deal with it.' The journalist said his daughter was now 'doing fine'. Mr Austin says that he and his wife had to care for Maddy at home because private health care caused her to become even more depressed Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has two young daughters, said that any father listening to Mr Austin's interview would be \"incredibly worried\". While the Government was investing £1.4 billion in the collaborative assessment and management of suicidality (Cams) over the course of the parliament, he acknowledged that more needed to be done. 'Obviously in Mark's case it is wonderful that his daughter made a full recovery, but I've spoken to a dad whose daughter committed suicide in Cumbria the day after she had a Cams appointment - I'm sure, not the fault of the Cams therapist she was seeing - but we didn't spot the seriousness of the problem and we weren't able to prevent that suicide. So I do think it is an area we need to do a lot better,' he told The World at One. After her father left his position at ITN in October last years Maddy tweeted her support Maddy is now living a healthier happier life and is keen to campaign for better funding for mental health 'It is partly about making financial commitment which I believe we are making. It is also about consistency of service because, as Mark Austin and other people have pointed out, it is very patchy.' While Mr Austin admits to a tough love approach with his daughter in the past this clearly hasn't had a negative impact on their relationship. After he left his position at ITN in October last years Maddy tweeted her support writing: ' Proud of you dad and everything you've achieved. I look up to you so much and always will. you will always be my hero.' Maddy has also written about her experiences in a blog post where she revealed she is learning to accept her past and move on. She says: 'I’ve reached a point in my life where I’m learning to accept that not everyone will understand how I’ve felt and how things have affected me. 'No, I may never be able to talk completely openly about my life without a huge amount of discomfort, and maybe I will always have that lingering fear of falling in the back of my mind. 'But there is no reason why I should let that stop me from feeling enjoyment, happiness, and life. There is no quick fix to stopping your past defining you but every year I’m further away from hell than I once was.'
