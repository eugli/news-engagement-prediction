You're Not Alone. \nBut the issue is more complicated than people think. Most Popular By Sarah Rense Feb 23, 2017 On Wednesday evening, the Trump administration withdrew support of transgender bathroom rights protection for students across the country, jumping feet first into a culture battle by sending the issue back to the states. The direct fallout of the decision is unclear, like many of President Trump's chaotic actions—ironic, seeing as the administration cited legal confusion as its reason for lifting the protections. But, as BuzzFeed legal editor Chris Geidner pointed out , a withdrawal is not a reversal.

(The Obama administration was vocal in its support of transgender bathroom rights when it sent its directive to public schools.) It also insisted that the withdrawal \"does not leave students without protections from discrimination, bullying, or harassment,\" according to BuzzFeed .

These young people already face incredible hurdles in their pursuit of education and acceptance. With a pen stroke, the Trump administration effectively sanctions the bullying, ostracizing and isolation of these children, putting their very lives in danger.
