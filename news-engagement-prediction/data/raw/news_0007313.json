At least. \nPeople are NOT happy about this.

Blow (@CharlesMBlow) February 2, 2017 Twitter Twitter Twitter \nTo be fair to McConaughey, he wasn’t necessarily asking the country to “embrace” Trump, but to try to come to terms with the fact Trump is indeed the president, as hard as that might be for some to accept . \nA lot of people seemed to interpret this as him contending people need to unify behind Trump. But, it seems as though he was simply asking people to do the best they can to work with him for the sake of the country. \nStill, if this doesn’t sit well with people, that’s completely understandable. \nPresident Trump has done very little to unite the country since his inauguration. \nHis rhetoric and executive actions have proven to be extremely divisive, and he’s reacted to any opposition with indignation and Twitter tantrums . \nIt’s pretty hard to be “constructive” with a man like that, and it’s a large part of the reason Trump is the most unpopular new president in modern US history. \nMcConaughey also said, “We’ll see what he does compared to what he had said,” which suggests he hasn’t really been paying attention since January 20. \nIn other words, Trump is fulfilling a lot of his most unsettling campaign promises . He’s doing what he said he would, and the results are not pretty. Is America's Fear Of Foreign Terrorism Rational?

So maybe people should cut him a little slack. Are We Living In A Post-Fact America?
