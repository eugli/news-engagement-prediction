Justin Bieber Justin Bieber Advertisement \nThanks to TMZ , we’ve seen scans of the “Sorry” singer’s photo shoot rider — the contract that photographers have to sign before the Biebs will even set his precious foot in your studio. Some requests: \nHerbal tea, deli meats, veggies, Swedish Fish, and Ritz Bits (in both cheese and peanut butter varieties). \nNo Selena Gomez music! Apparently someone’s still a little sore about that on-again, off-again romance ... \nThe most ridiculous of them all: no speaking directly to Justin Bieber. Which we imagine makes photoshoots take forever . Christina Aguilera Christina Aguilera Advertisement \nDuring her heyday, Xtina’s contract rider demanded items like Flintstones vitamins, Oreo cookies, soy cheese… and a police escort to route her car through any potential traffic delays. \nBecause, obviously, no diva should have to endure the utter agony of a red light. Selena Gomez Selena Gomez Advertisement \nThis “Good For You” songstress’s demands, if the rumors are true, have been motivated by something different: heartbreak. \nA report from Hollywood Life says Selena spent her whole March 2014 Adidas Neo commercial shoot in breakup mode after splitting from Justin Bieber (again) and banned the name “Justin” from being said on-set. \nIt’s a pretty common name, so a few crew members reportedly had to go by a different name for a while. Lady Gaga Lady Gaga Advertisement \nFrom “a mannequin with puffy pink pubic hair” to 28 bottles of water at room temperature and 28 cold bottle, Mother Monster’s requests run the gamut from totally bizarre to oddly specific, Celebuzz reports. \nBut what else can you expect from someone who looks at raw meat and sees formalwear? Katy Perry Katy Perry Advertisement \nThis “Roar” star’s backstage dream suite includes “two cream-colored egg chairs, one of which should have a footstool,” as well as a refrigerator with a glass door, according to The Smoking Gun . \nThe “Wide Awake” singer is also firmly anti-carnation. “ABSOLUTELY NO CARNATIONS,” her rider specifies. Beyonce Beyonce Advertisement \nWhile Queen Bey’s camp denies them, rumors abounded about her rider for her Mrs. Carter Tour . A source told the Daily Star about her alleged list of demands , including: \nAll crew members have to wear 100 percent cotton. \nAlkaline water must be chilled to 21 degrees and served with $900 titanium straws. \nBathrooms must have new toilet seats and red toilet paper at every venue. \nHand-carved ice balls should be made after each show to cool her throat. Madonna Madonna Advertisement \nThis \"Vogue\" singer is the Queen of Pop, so it’s only fitting she would demand her very own throne while on tour. \nMadge requires a brand new toilet seat at every show, in addition to dozens of white roses and candles to protect from “negative glances and mean-spiritedness.” the Daily Mail reports. \nPerhaps even more shocking is Madonna’s request to ban air conditioning in every venue to protect her vocal chords. Fans who flocked to see her Confessions World Tour in London in 2006 began fainting as temps inside the arena hit the 90-degree mark. Kris Jenner Kris Jenner Advertisement \nThis Kardashian matriarch tried to play the celebrity card to bypass ordinary people — you know, us mere commoners — while waiting in line for an iPhone 5 at an Apple Store in Los Angeles, reports Radar Online . \nRebuffed by the managers, Kris sent her assistant on the fool’s errand anyway. Guards keeping order among the throngs of Apple devotees simply told the gofer to get in line. Tom Cruise Tom Cruise Advertisement \nWhile touring the Adriatic Sea in his luxury yacht, the Jack Reacher leading man stopped in the port of Kotor and asked the manager of the five-star Forza Mare to clear out the 10-room boutique hotel so that he could spend quality solo time with his dinner, Brit publication The Sun r eports. \nThe manager balked at the request — and rightly so — so a disgruntled Tom had a seafood spread delivered to his yacht instead.
