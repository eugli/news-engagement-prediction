Stock success \nHowever, over the course of the year it underperformed the S&P 500 share index for the fourth time in the last five years. \nThe growth in the company's book value - that is the company's assets minus its liabilities and Mr Buffett's preferred measure of Berkshire's performance - was 10.7% in 2016, while the S&P 500 rose 12.0%. \nMr Buffett said investors \"will almost certainly do well\" by staying with a \"collection of large, conservatively financed American businesses\". \nThe gifted stock-picker, who is on course to win a 2008 bet that an investment in the S&P 500 would beat five hedge funds over 10 years, also took a fresh swipe at highly paid \"active\" investment managers. \nHe said \"1,000 monkeys would be just as likely to produce a seemingly all-wise prophet\" as 1,000 highly paid professionals. 'Epitaph' \nHowever, one investment manager said he felt Mr Buffett spent too much of the letter extolling Berkshire's virtues and did not address what went wrong with Kraft Heinz's failed takeover of UK household goods giant Unilever . \nThe letter was more about Mr Buffett's \"epitaph even more so than prior letters\", said Cole Smead of Smead Capital Management. \nLast week, Kraft, in which Berkshire is a major investor, dropped its $143bn (£115bn) takeover attempt amid strong opposition from Unilever's board. \nMr Buffet has previously spoken against hostile takeovers - where firms try to buy out shareholders directly without support from the target's board.
