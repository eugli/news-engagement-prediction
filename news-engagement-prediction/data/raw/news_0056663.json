Johannesson​ spoke to students at a high school in the northern icelandic town of Akureyri, later taking questions. SCANPIX DENMARK \nPresident of Iceland Gudni Johannesson, right, with Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, has made his tastes clear. \nThe all important, and divisive, question of whether pineapple belongs on pizza was answered by the president, who said he was \"fundamentally opposed\" to the idea. \nREAD MORE: \nSocial media leapt to the president's side, as he was criticised for his not-so-sweet pizza diplomacy. The President of Iceland wants to ban pineapple on pizza. This man should, obviously, be put in charge of the whole world. — Amanda (@Pandamoanimum) February 21, 2017 \nBut whether or not it could actually be banned is out of the question, he later clarified. \nOn Tuesday, the president clarified his stance on Facebook: \"I like pineapples, just not on pizza. I do not have the power to make laws which forbid people to put pineapples on their pizza. I am glad that I do not hold such power\". \n\"Presidents should not have unlimited power. I would not want to hold this position if I could pass laws forbidding that which I don't like. I would not want to live in such a country.\" \nAnd with that all cleared up, the president annoyed others with his preferred choice of topping: seafood. @AlbertoNardelli \"Not pineapple, yet shellfish\". I guess Italy is recalling its ambassador anyway. — Thiago Ferrer Morini (@tferrerm) February 21, 2017 @AlbertoNardelli @felixsalmon Seafood? He better only mean anchovies or IMPEACH. — billiecat (@billiecat) February 21, 2017 \nAll the while, in Sweden it's normal to put banana on pizza. Oh yeah, that banana #pizza I had in #Sweden ? It had pineapple on it too.
