In addition to the flagship Univision network, the blackout included the UniMas broadcast network and cable TV channels Galavision, El Rey and Univision Deportes. \nUnivision had demanded that its channels be taken off Charter’s Spectrum cable system following a months-long dispute over carriage fees. Charter is the largest cable TV provider in Southern California. \nScarpulla’s order that led to the restoration of the channels lasts just seven days — until Feb. 9. It was unclear Thursday whether another judge, who is presiding over the court case between the two companies, will demand that Univision’s channels remain on Charter’s Spectrum service. \n“Today, the Supreme Court for the state of New York granted Charter a temporary restraining order, meaning that Univision programming will be returned to our customers,” a Charter spokesperson said in a statement announcing the court victory. \nAlthough squabbles between TV programmers and cable operators are becoming more common, it is highly unusual for a judge to intervene. However, this dispute was already in the courts because Univision filed a lawsuit against Charter contending the Connecticut cable operator was using an illegal manuever to avoid paying higher programming fees. The case was filed in New York, where Univision is based. \nCharter has long maintained that it has a valid contract with Univision, and the Spanish-language media giant had no right to demand that its channels be taken off Charter’s system. Charter is trying to adhere to a contract that Time Warner Cable struck with Univision in 2014. Charter bought Time Warner Cable last year, and has been hoping to pay the lower rates that Time Warner Cable — which was a substantially larger system — had negotiated. \n\"Univision remains ready and willing to meet at any time with Charter Spectrum to engage in comprehensive, good-faith negotiations for the long-term carriage of our stations and networks,\" the company said in a statement. \"To date, Charter Spectrum has steadfastly refused to engage in such negotiations.\" \nThe ruckus comes as Charter and other pay-TV operators are struggling to hold the line on programming costs. There are several other blackouts around the country, including one affecting Frontier Communications customers in Seattle and Portland, Ore., who have lost easy access to their ABC-affiliated station, owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group. \nIn late December a separate standoff ended with detente after media giant NBCUniversal threatened to yank its channels from Charter’s Spectrum service on the eve of a high-profile “Sunday Night Football” game. After NBC’s threat, a new contract was quietly ironed out. Caption 'Step' shows us its moves at Sundance \nThe young women in \"Step\" demonstrate a routine at the L.A.
