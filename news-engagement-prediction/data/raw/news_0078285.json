Jurgen Klopp sends warning to his Liverpool flops after Leicester loss \nThe La Liga pundit believes the playmaker could make it into any of the top side’s starting elevens outside of Madrid and expects Isco to force an exit from Real. \nChelsea were reported to have approached Isco about a potential summer switch while Arsenal are also thought to be monitoring the Spaniard’s situation. \nIsco has made 25 appearances for Real this season, but Gibson believes he is ‘wasted’ with the Spanish giants. \n‘Isco is a super player,’ Gibson told Sky Sports. Chelsea fixtures \nWest Ham (A) – Mon 6 Mar Manchester Utd – FA Cup (H) – Mon 13 Mar Stoke (A) – Sat 18 Mar Crystal Palace (H) – Sat 1 Apr Manchester City (H) – Wed 5 Apr Bournemouth (A) – Sat 8 Apr Manchester United (A) – Sat 15 Apr Isco is 25 in April (Picture: Getty) \n‘I can’t imagine Isco being at Real Madrid next season because he’s too good to be wasted. \n‘I know he is arguably at the biggest club in the world but when push comes to shove with these players at Real Madrid they just about accept the rotation so long as they get enough playing time.’ \nDespite the fact Luka Modric and Casemiro are ahead of Isco in the midfield pecking order, Gibson says at any other club the midfielder is first-choice. Chelsea reportedly want Isco at Stamford Bridge (Picture: Getty) \nAnd as Isco approaches 25, Gibson warned he cannot afford to stay at Real. \n‘The problem, which has also been a problem in recent seasons at Barcelona, is when the big games come and the preferred starting XI is chosen, leaving the likes of Isco out of the team.
