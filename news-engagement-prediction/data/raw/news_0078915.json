My parents came from Ireland,\" she says with a laugh.   \n\"After I retired, I took up hiking and cross-country skiing and before that I used to go square dancing and I belonged to a rifle club.\"\nAs for the time she spends reading with kids: \"I think the volunteering makes a huge difference,\" she says. \"Keeps your mind more alert.\"\nMORE CALGARY NEWS |  Calgary's 1st cat cafe to bring adoptable kitties to Kensington ​MORE CALGARY NEWS |  From hatred to handshakes: Red Deer Muslims want to meet mosque vandal", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T10:16:32.673+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
