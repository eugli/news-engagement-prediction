Keith Ellison of Minnesota said Thursday that he is open to the calls to initiate an impeachment process against President Trump. \n“I think that Donald Trump has already has done a number of things which legitimately raise the question of impeachment,” Mr. Ellison said in a CNN debate with the candidates running for DNC chair. \nRep. Maxine Waters of California and Joaquin Castro of Texas have said Congress should draw up articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump. \nThe DNC is slated to pick a new leader Saturday during a meeting in Atlanta. Mr. Ellison and former Labor Secretary Tom Perez are seen as the front runners in the race. \nIn response to a question, Mr. Ellison refused to rule out the idea of impeachment , saying he believes Mr. Trump has violated the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution through his business operations.
