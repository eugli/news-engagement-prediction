We were lucky enough to perform at the Queen's Theatre at the curtain call for Les Mis, we performed at Wembley Stadium, we've done the O2, the Royal Albert Hall and we do feel really lucky that we've been able to do those things in the last three years.\" \nMatt added: \"It's great because on our third tour we're headlining at the Palladium which is quite fitting for the Home tour because when we won BGT we got to perform there at the Royal Variety, and we've done Sunday night at the Palladium, we headlined our first tour there so to go back is quite nice, it's such a well known theatre so to go back there is amazing.\" \nHowever, there is a difference this time around. \nCollabro are now a four-piece after Richard Hadfield decided to leave the group and pursue his love of swing music. \nThere were lots of reports at the time of a feud between the band, and Richard told express.co.uk: \"There were just really difficult moments for me. There were a lot of conflicting views in the band and there were lots of moments where I felt on my own.\" The boys have just marked their third anniversary as a group (Photo: PR Handout) \nBut the boys told Mirror Celeb there's no bad blood between them. \nJamie said: \"He wanted to go and do his own thing and essentially, without going into too much detail, he was releasing his own music and we were obviously discussing a third album deal with various people and it got to the stage where all five of us were uncomfortable and something had to change. \n\"We did the big BGT performance for the 10th anniversary and the day after we just got an email saying he didn't want to do it any more and we wish him all the best. It was not an uncomfortable thing, we've refrained from talking about it out of respect for him, it's not been reciprocated, but at the end of the day we do wish him the very best and this album is by far the best we've ever made and that's not because Richard's not in the group any more and not vocally, it's because we've been able to work together as a four. \n\"We've always said before we're this band of brothers and best of friends, but now we actually hang out together outside of the group which is actually unheard of.\" They say this is their best album yet (Photo: Rex Features) Video Loading Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T18:15:22.622+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
