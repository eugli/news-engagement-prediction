Gyimah’s Cape Town airport scuffle with Ertugral set to come up in his exit interview at Pirates \n“But for Athlone we can only have 21 500 spectators and with complimentary tickets and other sundries it means we can only sell 17 800 to the public‚\" Efstathiou said. \n\"This is problematic because this is a high demand fixture. We need to add that Chiefs are currently top of the log‚ it’s the end of the month and a Saturday night game‚ so we are expecting demand far exceeding 21 500. \n\"We expect there will be many who turn up without tickets making security difficult‚” Efstathiou told a press conference at the club. \n“But the PSL are insisting that the game must be played. At the first meeting with police last week it was agreed not to hold the game but a second meeting was insisted on and this also agreed that it would not be safe. \n“But the police commissioner has been instructed from national headquarters to hold a third meeting which is tomorrow (Wednesday) to reconsider. Cape Town City coach Tinkler explains the secret of club's success \n\"The police are also stretched because of the event at the Cape Town Stadium and the rugby at Newlands (The Stormers play the Bulls at the start of the new Super Rugby season). \n“In the meantime we are unable to sell tickets until we know if the game is going ahead or not‚” the Ajax boss explained. \n“We have tried since October to find a solution but we were not allowed to go to Moses Mabhida. Chiefs have not agreed to our request for a postponement either.” \n“If we are forced to go ahead with the game we face being liable for any problems that occur. \n\"The police have only 80 members who are available to handle matters outside and we have a security contingent of 400 inside the stadium. Obviously we are extremely concerned.” \nEfstathiou said he had been in almost daily contact with PSL chief executive officer Mato Madlala but she had told him she could not make a decision without a police report. \nIt is expected a final decision will be made on Wednesday. \nMadlala and PSL spokesman Lux September could not be reached comment on Tuesday afternoon. \n- TMG Digital", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:49:44.804+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
