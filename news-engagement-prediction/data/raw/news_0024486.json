Others including his CFA counterpart Russell Rees, with whom he remains friends, defended their actions or attacked the legitimacy of the inquiry. \nEwan was willing to say sorry. He remembers it as an excruciating period. \n\"I had to really work at not getting too emotional about it. I could have cracked up really easily. \n\"For example, when a firefighter got killed and I had to do just a little [media interview] grab saying 'this has hit us hard and we're feeling it'. \n\"I rehearsed for hours that night before just to get a sentence-and-a-half out. And that takes a hell of a toll on you. \n\"You cope with it almost by numbing down. You shut down to a lot of your emotions or you can't keep going. As another senior manager said, 'We can't sook over this. We've got to keep our heads up, we've got to lead.'\" \nMeditation helped. Relaxation techniques. Some professional help. \nThe Waller family home was burnt out when Ewan was a teenager, but it took Black Saturday to join the dots, to realise how deeply it had affected him. He remembers his dad labouring for days afterwards to prop up fences and keep stock. \nA truckload of hay turned up from one of the big stock and station agents. Surrounded by blackened paddocks, the driver handed his father the bill in the same breath as the help. \n\"You know you just say, 'Where's your heart, what are you doing?'\" Video: Ewan Waller says people are still suffering in the aftermath of Black Saturday (ABC News) \nEwan admits he's yet to fully recover from Black Saturday. It's changed who he is. There are mental and even physical scars - a deep wearing down. \n\"The personal impacts show up in what to me were quite surprising ways. One of the impacts was I couldn't concentrate. \n\"After Black Saturday and after the royal commission I'd look at a page of technical writing where I used to be able to scan and get the gist of it within a very short period of time and I found I couldn't. \n\"If I turned the page I'd forget what was written on the first page. That's certainly quite common in trauma events where you lose the ability to concentrate and memory and short-term recall but it was surprising to me. \n\"I sincerely believed I was losing my mind because I'd been very sharp and could pull things together quickly. I couldn't do it. \n\"And one of the consequences of that was I was managing poorly. I couldn't read and I couldn't convey as I believed I had to. That's one of the real disappointments, the last couple of years of my career in the public service weren't good.\" \nDepartment managers started fighting and the teamwork disintegrated. \n\"You couldn't trust the person sitting beside you, that's about how bad it was. There was no common cause... a lot of good people suffered. \n\"There was a lot of stress and a lot of strain, a lot of people not knowing what to do. The problem was so immense, the community expecting silver bullets and they weren't there.\" \nThe bush is a balm. \nThe drive from Melbourne to Gippsland is a slow unravelling as the suburbs turn to bush. The flick of a lyrebird, a wallaby crashing across the road. \nThe scent of the eucalypts is still enough to make Ewan's breath catch. The musky smell at the head of a gully. The dogwoods. \nAnd then the dappled light once the truck leaves the cleared land. The loosening in the muscles, the mind. \nThese days Ewan uses his regrets as motivation. \nBetween the weeds and the fencing, reports are written at the kitchen table in the old farmhouse where he lives on the property that was once his father's, where his parents began their married life in a bark hut that was later razed in a bushfire that burnt from Licola to Bruthen in 1965. \nAs a bushfire management consultant, he travels the country working with state agencies and private landowners, spreading knowledge he hopes will restore the confidence to manage forest fuels by preventative burning. \n\"I think a lot of it came back to the fire agencies scaring people. They didn't really understand bushfire so they then said, 'Don't anybody do it. If you light a fire on your property and it gets away, you'll be prosecuted.' \n\"And so now we've got a culture that's scared of fire rather than respecting fire and saying it's just part of the Australian landscape, respect it, use it but don't be scared of it. \n\"I really am concerned about the ability to manage the bush. I look now at the modern practitioner who looks at the computer and goes to a meeting in Melbourne or the regional centre and it's a different life.\" \nEwan says it was his knowledge of the bush and the push to get things in better shape that motivates him to go on. \n\"The best preparation we can do is do it now, in the quiet before it turns bad again. And it will, it will turn bad again.\" \nFormer CFA fire chief Russell Rees was invited but declined to participate in this story. \nPart five in this series will be published on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:12:28.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
