Josh Kim, owner of Spot Gourmet Burger, says sugary drink sales at his shop have gone down about 10 to 15 percent. \n“If you read the legislation, it’s bollocks,” says Kim. “This is just another example of this city mismanaging its dollars.” \nHowever, Mayor Jim Kenney says the beverage industry, driven by greed, is misleading the public. \n“It is fear mongering,” says Kenney. “This is them trying to hold onto their wealth. We are asking for a little bit of that money to educate poor kids.” \nKenney added, “These American Beverage Association guys making seven, eight figures a year are whining like little babies. I don’t have any sympathy for them.” \nThe Revenue Department has launched a monitoring campaign to assure distributors comply, with a beefed up collection and enforcement staff.
