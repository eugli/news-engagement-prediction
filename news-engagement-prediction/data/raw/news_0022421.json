Editor Advertisement \nLately, been reading more and more reports of people who are homeless being more open about their situation, and can be seen making public spaces as their temporary homes. Previous years, these homeless people prefer to remain unseen and unheard. \nYou only come across them by accident. But now, you can see them everywhere. On the beaches, in shopping malls, eateries, near supermarkets and in multi purpose halls in HDB estates. MSF had said that the number of homeless people in Singapore had not gone up, but they have not gone down either. It is only because they are now more visible that the homeless come into the thoughts of Singaporeans. \nSo the question is, now that they are more visible, there is no way to deny their existence. Should more effort then be made to reach out to them and help them out? \nAhmad Kassim \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
