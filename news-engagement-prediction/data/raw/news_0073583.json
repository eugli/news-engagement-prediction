Demecillo   \nCEBU, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte once again named former mayor Michael Rama as alleged drug protector in a speech he delivered in Davao del Norte last Friday. \nIn a report by GMA-7, Duterte even identified Rama as governor of Cebu Province. \n“I've named him before, and I'll name him again. Si Rama. Governor sa Cebu. Protektor eh,\" Duterte was quoted in the report. \nSought for comment, Rama said he will issue a statement on the matter in a press conference. \n\"Apil lang na nako og tubag sa presscon kay wala ko kahibaw nga governor na diay ko,\" he said about the label. \nHe said he has not spoken with the president since the time Duterte mentioned his name publicly last year.   \nRama believes one way of clearing his name is to speak with Duterte personally. \n\"Mao na akong question. Wala mi nagkastorya gyod. Nangayo kog audience before,\" he told The FREEMAN. \nLast year, after he was named as an alleged drug protector, Rama went to the central office of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and met with PDEA Director General Isidro Lapeña. He said their meeting lasted for over an hour during which he asked PDEA for documents that placed him in the list of alleged narco-politicians. \n“I highlighted, how can I be a drug protector? Who is the drug lord? Of course, they (PDEA) cannot give me the name. How can they even give the name, they don't even have the document?” Rama said in an earlier interview. — /JMO (FREEMAN)  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:26:00.831+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
