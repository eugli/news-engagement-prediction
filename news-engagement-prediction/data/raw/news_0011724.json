He said: \n“Now, I’m not saying that was all Donald Trump’s fault…although, it doesn’t look good. But if it was Hillary Clinton, this would be the new Benghazi. This would be Benghazi times ten.” \nLahren agreed that it would have been unfair to “peg this” on Clinton, just as it is with President Donald Trump. Maher reiterated her sentiment on the basis that “we know” it was “bull sh*t” to blame Benghazi on Clinton. \nHe went on to make light of her position as Secretary of State and said: \n“The Secretary of State is not actually in charge of checking security at every consulate and embassy in the world. They acted like she should have been on the phone…’What’s the back gate look like now? I noticed there was a bulb out last week…’” \nThen, Secretary of State of Missouri and Democrat Senate candidate Jason Kander accused Clinton detractors of “using the people who died as political chess pieces for years.” \nKander, a former Army intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan, said he feels “bad” for the guys on the ground since Trump allegedly isn’t “interested” in receiving intelligence briefings . \nThen, he turned his attention directly towards Lahren and posed a question: \n“You all can talk about it, but what are the names of the guys who died?” \nLahren, a fierce supporter of the United States military, turned her chair to face him directly as she fired off the four names of the late Americans: \n“Chris Stevens, the ambassador, Tyrone Woods, Glenn Doherty, Sean Smith.” \nKander, who seemed to think he walked Lahren right into an easy trap, was taken aback. He stammered and made one comment: \n“Good for you. I haven’t heard their names in years.” \nThe young political commentator posted the clip on her Instagram account: A video posted by Tomi Lahren (@tomilahren) on Feb 4, 2017 at 1:38pm PST \nShe wrote: \n“If you think you’re going to back someone into a corner on Benghazi, pick a different girl. I’m not the one. Trust me. I know all 4 names and honor their service and sacrifice.” \nBOOM.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T12:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T07:47:47.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
