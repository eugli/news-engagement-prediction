Why should we ban a Muslim girl like her who has done no violence from entering America? \n“You are making a blanket statement against Muslims and I feel very offended,” he said. \nThis video had raised many questions from local netizens on Fazura’s relationship with Siedman as she previously insisted that they were just friends. \n> Muhammad Izuan Yaacob, 24, learned the hard way that being a pimp has its consequences when he was sentenced to three years jail and fined RM5,000 by the Sessions Court. \nHe was sentenced by judge Nazri Ismail on Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to supplying Thai prostitutes and controlling the prostitution racket at Jalan Bayam Lorong Wa’Long in Kota Baru. \nKosmo! reported that Muhammad was unable to pay the fine and was sentenced to an additional 12 months in jail. \nThe married Muhammad Izuan, who was not represented by a lawyer, swore to never do such things again and pleaded for the judge to lower the fine. \nAt the same court, two Thai prostitutes related to the case, Pateemoh Samah and Yae-Nak Hayiwateh, were sentenced to six months jail and a fine of RM5,000 after pleading guilty for soliciting for customers. \n> Harian Metro reported about a 20-year-old woman who was found in bed with a man, also 20, whom she had met through the chatting app, WeChat. \nThey were arrested by Jabatan Hal Ehwal Agama Terengganu (JHEAT) following a public tip-off. \nTogether with two policemen, the JHEAT authorities found the couple when they raided a hotel in Kuala Terengganu. \nThe woman also admitted that she had sex with the man before. \n● Found in Translation is compiled from the vernacular newspapers (Bahasa Malaysia, Chinese and Tamil dailies).
