Sessions must follow Department of Justice guidance and recuse himself,\" Schumer said Wednesday at a news conference on Capitol Hill.", "external_links": ["http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2017/02/government_by_white_nationalism_is_upon_us.html", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrGQr-gXT3s", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5LweycOGNY", "https://www.c-span.org/video/?424097-1/senate-democrats-react-reports-contacts-trump-presidential-campaign-russians"], "published": "2017-02-16T06:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:01:31.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
