They will chase a third straight national championship at the United States Collegiate Athletic Association’s Division II tournament this week. Credit Benjamin Norman for The New York Times \nAdvertisement   Mejia’s teammates filtered into the gym, including his fellow starters — all seniors: the leading scorer, Massiah Merritt, a crafty and acrobatic shooting guard (14.8 points per game); Stephon Jennings, a 6-5 forward, who leads Berkeley in rebounding (9.2 per game); Dondre Simmons, a slashing guard; and Green, a steady inside presence averaging about 12 points and 7 rebounds. Practice began at 8:30 p.m. (Any player who arrives late receives a half-game suspension. Cursing is prohibited.) Players huddled for a prayer, then ran full-court drills. With each pass, ballhandlers shouted the recipient’s name; after missed layups or dunks, players flashed embarrassed smiles and dropped to the floor for a mandatory 25 push-ups. Christiansen looked at his cellphone. He had missed a call from a former player, who had just separated from his wife and wanted to talk about it. They ended up chatting later that night and the next morning, the coach said. \nAdvertisement   Mejia led the team through stretching exercises. His confidence has soared since his freshman year. A course in public speaking helped, he said, and friendships on the team have brought him out of his shell. Before a recent game, he was spotted shimmying to music and joking with the two young daughters of Jonathan Pena, 32, a former player who is the associate head coach.

But Christiansen counseled him on managing his emotions, and Pena became Berkeley’s starting point guard and captain, then joined the coaching staff, initially as a volunteer. \nAdvertisement   At practice this night, Pena oversaw the big men. Sweat soaking through his shirt, he issued orders in rapid succession: “Jump to the ball!” “Turn around quick!” Finally, Pena jumped into the fray, bodying up post players over a half-foot taller. \nAdvertisement On the opposite end, guards worked on ballhandling and shooting as Christiansen watched from under the bill of a New York Giants cap. He shouted encouragement — “Let’s go! Look alive!” — and high-fived or hugged players who crossed his path. \nAdvertisement   Soon, the coaches and players were back on the subway . Green rode to Brooklyn’s Walt Whitman Houses, a city housing project, where he lives with his mother. “There’s times I walk home and hear gunshots going off,” he said. He usually stays up late studying and wakes up at 5:30 a.m. to work out or study more. Often, he watches motivational speeches online recommended by Pena.

He works full time as a customer relationship manager at the Weather Channel in Midtown. \nAdvertisement   His trip home to Queens, where he lives with his wife and daughters, can take two hours. As he sleeps, Pena keeps his cellphone on — next to his Bible — in case a player calls. “I tell them, ‘If you go through something, we’ve got to be the first ones you call,’” Pena said. “Maybe they don’t have that kind of support in their life.” \nAdvertisement   Keep Moving the Ball In November, Berkeley avenged its last loss with a 76-72 win over Mercy, after trailing by 12 points at halftime.

Offensively, Christiansen said, “as soon as we get the ball, we run.” \nAdvertisement   “We don’t walk,” he continued. “We don’t dribble the ball a thousand times. We get rid of it.” Past Berkeley players are closely following the team’s streak. Christiansen stays in touch with former players, nearly a dozen of them said in interviews. They hear from him on holidays and meet with him if they need advice, professional or personal. \nAdvertisement   Chan-Man left Berkeley shy of graduating because his mother became ill. But, he said, Christiansen and Pena still call or text him on his birthday — and on his daughter’s — and check in regularly about his mother’s health. “It’s not like we won the championship and then I got kicked to the curb,” Chan-Man, who has no basketball eligibility remaining, said recently. “There’s love there.
