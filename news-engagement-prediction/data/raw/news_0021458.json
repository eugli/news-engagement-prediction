It moved me deeply. (Sunny and Dev) are both outstanding ... and Nicole Kidman’s monologue, in which she tells her adopted son the truth about his adoption, is the most powerful scene (and) another exceptional performance. I loved the moments when Saroo’s past and present seem to fuse,” Rushdie told pagesix.com. \nGarth Davis won best first-time director for the film at Directors Guild Awards, and Greig Fraser got the top award from the American Society of Cinematographers. \nDev was honoured at the Santa Barbara Film Festival with the virtuoso award for breakthrough stars. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T19:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:53:41.068+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
