Zero, one, oneâ€¦ \nThat is the language of computers. Every clever thing your computer does - make a call, search a database, play a game - comes down to ones and zeroes. \nActually, it comes down to the presence (one) or absence (zero) of a current in tiny transistors on a semiconductor chip. \nThankfully, we do not have to program computers in zeroes and ones. \nMicrosoft Windows, for example, uses 20GB, or 170 billion ones and zeroes. \nPrinted out, the stack of A4 paper would be two and a half miles (4km) high. \nImagine setting every transistor manually. \nIgnoring how fiddly this would be - transistors measure just billionths of a metre - if it took a second to flip each switch, installing Windows would take 5,000 years.

Image copyright IBM \nIt whirred away under instruction from a roll of perforated paper tape. \nIf you wanted it to solve a new equation, you had to work out which switches should be on or off, which wires should be plugged in where. \nThen, you had to flip all the switches, plug all the wires, and punch all the holes in the paper tape. \nProgramming it was not just difficult, but involved tedious, repetitive and error-prone manual labour. \nFour decades on from the Harvard Mark 1, more compact and user-friendly machines such as the Commodore 64 found their way into schools. \nYou may remember the childhood thrill of typing this: 10 print \"Hello world\" \n\"Hello world\" would fill the screen, in chunky, low-resolution text. \nYou had instructed the computer in words that were recognisably, intuitively human. \nIt seemed like a minor miracle. Mathematical brilliance \nOne reason for computers' astonishing progression since the Mark 1 is certainly ever-tinier components. \nBut it is also because programmers can write software in human-like language, and have it translated into the ones and zeroes, the currents or not-currents, that ultimately do the work. \nThe thing that began to make that possible was called a compiler. \nAnd behind the compiler was a woman called Grace Hopper. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lt Grace Hopper using a new calculating machine invented by Howard Aiken for the US Navy's use during World War Two \nNowadays, there is much discussion about how to get more women into tech. \nIn 1906, when Grace was born, not many people cared about gender equality. \nFortunately for Grace, her father wanted his daughters to get the same education as his son. \nSent to a good school, Grace turned out to be brilliant at maths. \nHer grandfather was a rear admiral, and her childhood dream was to join the US Navy, but girls were not allowed. Unwieldy contraption \nThen, in 1941, the attack on Pearl Harbor dragged America into World War Two. \nMale talent was called away. \nThe US Navy started taking women. Grace signed up at once. \nIf you are wondering why the navy needs mathematicians, consider aiming a missile. \nAt what angle and direction should you fire? \nThe answer depends on many things: target distance, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction. \nThese are not complex calculations, but they were time-consuming for a human \"computer\" armed only with pen and paper. \nAs Lt (junior grade) Hopper graduated from midshipmen's school in 1944, the navy was intrigued by the potential of an unwieldy machine recently devised by Harvard professor Howard Aiken - the Mark 1. \nThe navy sent Lt Hopper to help Prof Aiken work out what it could do. Image copyright USAF/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption Grace Hopper with Howard Aitken (middle, bottom row) and the rest of the Harvard Mark 1 computer team in 1944 \nProf Aiken was not thrilled to have a female join the team, but Lt Hopper impressed him enough that he asked her to write the operating manual. \nThis involved plenty of trial and error. \nMore often than not, the Mark 1 would grind to a halt soon after starting - and there was no user-friendly error message. \nOnce, it was because a moth had flown into the machine - that gave us the modern term \"debugging\". \nMore often, the bug was metaphorical - a wrongly flipped switch, a mispunched hole in the paper tape. \nThe detective work was laborious and dull.
