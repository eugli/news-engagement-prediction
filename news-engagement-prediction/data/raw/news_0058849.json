Chandrasekhar Rao, popularly known as KCR, offered jewellery worth about Rs 5.59 crore to Lord Venkateswara Swamy in Tirumala Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh on behalf of his government on Wednesday morning. \nKCR, who was the flag-bearer of the agitation for a separate Telangana state, had taken a vow during the movement that he would offer gold jewellery to Lord Venkateswara, also known as Lord Balaji if Telangana got the statehood. \nOn Wednesday, during the VIP break darshan, Rao presented Saligrama Haram (a lotus model golden necklace), weighing about 14.9 kg and a five-row Kante (carcanet), weighing 4.65 kg to Lord Venkateshwara amid vedic chants. \nThe total cost of the ornaments is said to be around Rs 5.5 crore. Rao has been criticised by Opposition parties and civil society for misusing public money on his personal vows. \nWHO ALL ACCOMPANIED KCR TO THE SHRINE \nChief Minister KCR, along with wife Shoba Rao, Minister son KT Rama Rao, Lok Sabha MP daughter K. Kavita, Minister and nephew Harish Rao, daughter-in-law, son-in-law and grand children reached Tirupati in an aircraft on Tuesday. \nTelangana Assembly Speaker S. Madhusudana Chary, Ministers A. Indrakaran Reddy, E. Rajender, T. Padma Rao, P. Srinivas Reddy, Chief Advisor to Government Rajiv Sharma and Chief Secretary S.P. Singh among others also accompanied the chief minister during the visit. \nLater this week, KCR is also scheduled to offer a gold moustache at the Veerbhadraswamy temple in Kuravi in Telangana's Warangal district. \nPREVIOUS DONATIONS AT TEMPLES \nIn October last year, Rao had offered a 12 kg gold crown worth Rs 3.5 crore to Goddess Bhadrakali in Warangal. \nAfter taking charge as the Chief Minister of Telangana, KCR had offered a crown and a necklace to Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala and a nose stud to Goddess Kanaka Durga in Vijayawada. \nRao's extravagant spending on trying to win the favour of the gods has drawn flak from various quarters as most other pressing issues of the state are yet to be addressed.
