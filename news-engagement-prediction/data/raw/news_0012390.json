To help get you ready, we rank the 58 previous editions of the Great American Race from worst to best. ISC Archives via Getty Images RacingOne 57 2003 \nNo disrespect to race-winner Michael Waltrip, but we’re ranking this one 58 th because it’s the shortest Daytona 500 ever run — just 109 laps or 272.5 miles were completed before being called due to rain. Getty Images Getty Images 56 1965 Rain shortens the Daytona 500 to just 333 miles, as Fred “The Golden Boy” Lorenzen cruises to victory in No. 28 Holman-Moody Ford. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 55 2009 Elliott Sadler dominates, but when rain comes after 380 miles, it’s Matt Kenseth who is declared the winner in the third-shortest Daytona 500 ever. Getty Images Getty Images for NASCAR 54 1973 The fourth of seven 500 wins for King Richard Petty, who wins by a full two laps over fellow future NASCAR Hall of Fame member Bobby Isaac. This is the largest margin of victory in Daytona 500 history. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 53 1964 Richard Petty dominates the field, leading 184 of 200 laps to drub the competition and win the first of his record-setting seven Daytona 500s. Petty lapped the entire field. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 52 1972 In one of the least competitive Daytona 500s ever, A.J. Foyt leads 167 laps, with the only other drivers to lead laps being Bobby Allison (2 laps led) and Richard Petty (31). The racing really wasn’t better back then. Getty Images Chris Trotman 51 1991 Under caution, Ernie Irvan wins in the powerhouse Morgan-McClure Chevrolet over Sterling Marlin. Ironically, Marlin would go on to replace Irvan in 1994 after he leaves the team to join Robert Yates. Focus on Sport Focus on Sport/Getty Images 50 2000 The yellow flag is out as Dale Jarrett wins his third and final Daytona 5oo, as Jeff Burton, Bill Elliott, Rusty Wallace and Mark Martin make it an all-Ford top five.

MCT MCT via Getty Images 46 1966 Richard Petty, a/k/a “The King,” laps the entire field to win his second of a record seven Daytona 500 race victories.

Robert Alexander Getty Images 44 1981 Richard Petty wins his seventh and final Daytona 500 over Bobby Allison and Ricky Rudd. After previously winning in Plymouths (1964, ’66 and ’71), Dodges (1973-74) and an Oldsmobile (1979), Petty wins his last 500 piloting a Buick. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 43 1982 J.D. Stacy sponsors seven of the 42 cars in the field, but it’s the No. 88 Gatorade Buick driven by Bobby Allison that makes it to Victory Lane as Allison wins his second of three Daytona 500s. Bob Harmeyer Getty Images 42 1974 The fifth of seven Daytona 500 victories for Richard Petty, who defeats Cale Yarborough by 47 seconds, or nearly a full lap. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 41 1983 In a tight battle with upcoming star Bill Elliott, Cale Yarborough wins his third of four Daytona 500s and his first since 1977. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 40 1971 How’s this for a top five? Richard Petty wins over teammate Buddy Baker, followed by A.J. Foyt, David Pearson and Fred Lorenzen. That’s stout company. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 39 1984 A year earlier, Cale Yarborough won the Daytona 500 in a Harry Ranier-owned Pontiac. This time, he wins in a Ranier Chevrolet ahead of Dale Earnhardt and Darrell Waltrip. It’s Yarborough’s fourth and final Daytona 500 victory. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 38 1961 Pontiacs sweep the top three spots, with Marvin Panch driving Smokey Yunick’s year-old car to a win over Joe Weatherly and Paul Goldsmith. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 37 1985 Bill Elliott leads 136 of 200 laps to win his first Daytona 500, but at the checkered flag, his margin over Lake Speed is just 0.94 seconds. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 36 1978 \nIn his 17 th attempt, NASCAR Hall of Fame member Bobby Allison scores the first of his three Daytona 500 victories. Cale Yarborough is the only other driver to finish on the lead lap with Allison.

RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 19 1962 Fireball Roberts dominates the beach in ‘62, winning his Daytona 500 qualifying racing, beating Richard Petty to win the 500 and then returning in July to win the Firecracker 250. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 18 1980 Driving an Oldsmobile nicknamed “The Gray Ghost,” Buddy Baker sets a speed record that remains intact, averaging 177.602 miles per hour in the fastest Daytona 500 in history. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 17 2004 In the first of his two Daytona 500 victories, Dale Earnhardt Jr. leads 58 laps, while second-place finisher Tony Stewart leads a race-high 98 circuits but can’t seal the deal. 16 1989 This one might have been fate. In his 17 th Daytona 500 start, Darrell Waltrip drives the No. 17 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet to an emotional victory, after which he dances in Victory Lane. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 15 1969 LeeRoy Yarbrough comes from behind and drives Junior Johnson’s Ford past Charlie Glotzbach’s Cotton Owens-owned Dodge on the backstretch on the final lap to win a thriller.

Getty Images for NASCAR Robert Laberge 11 1963 In the preliminary sports car race at Daytona, Wood Brothers Racing driver Marvin Panch flips his Maserati, which burst into flames. Tiny Lund sees the crash and pulls Panch out of the burning car. In gratitude, the Woods ask Lund to drive in the 500, which he goes on to win. Lund is the only driver to win NASCAR’s biggest race on a single set of tires. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 10 2007 \nKevin Harvick comes out of nowhere on the last lap to edge Mark Martin by half a fender in a thrilling finish. Behind them, as they race to the checkered flag, a huge crash takes out a number of cars, including Clint Bowyer’s Chevrolet, which flips and catches fire. Getty Images Getty Images for NASCAR 9 1988 In an extremely popular finish, Bobby Allison wins over son Davey, the only time in history that a father-son combination finished 1-2 in the Daytona 500.
