That is the first step and it will be followed by a fine and, eventually, suspension. \nGyan is currently with Al Alhi in Dubai, on loan from Shanghai SIPG. He recently got a mohawk for the Africa Cup of Nations and kept the hairstyle when he returned to Al Alhi. \nExactly how the rules are enforced and the consistency of them appear to be unclear. Ahdaaf, a site that covers Middle Eastern soccer, cited 2016 Asian Player of the Year Omar Abdulrahman being allowed to keep his hair, while a similar haircut earned Suhail Al-Mansoori a warning.
