That was him taking a subliminal shot back at Drake. Cause he dissed Jay on sneakin. Real clever #Shining pic.twitter.com/U98wrs3OxE \n— Malachi (@Theboymala) February 13, 2017 \nDrake offered some subliminal shade on the song, rapping “You ain’t own it right away, you had to wait on niggas / Man, I’m only 29, have some patience with us / Plus I never met nobody from my label, nigga / I just pop up with the music then they pay a nigga.” \nGiven that Jay Z and Drake swapped subliminal disses last year courtesy of “I Got The Keys” and “Summer Sixteen,” this is just the latest in an ongoing saga. \nThe 2016 shade got off to an early start when Drake dropped “Summer Sixteen” in January and declared that he “used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then [he] turned into Jay.” \nJay fired back months later on “I Got The Keys,” rapping “Till you’re on your own you can’t be me.” \nWith Drake’s More Life playlist project promised before the end of February, and Jay Z seemingly working on a new project behind the scenes, fans probably won’t have to wait long for the next volley in this war of words. \nCheck out some of the reaction below. Jay Z forever telling Drake to take a seat every record he drops lol \n— FRΞS₭Θ (@Fresko_isme) February 13, 2017 Jay Z emptied out his subliminal clip on Drake lol \n— Plus Pierre (@_SirPlus) February 13, 2017 jay z drops 3 verses a year and even he responded to Drake faster than Pusher Tee \n— Boogie Bousins (@bansky) February 13, 2017 I love this subliminal war that Drake and Jay Z have. Also Kendrick occasionally joins in on the fun too. That's real hiphop. #Shining @rihanna to Drake: You used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then you turned into Jay, go you \nRiri to Jay Z: And he believed it #RocNationBrunch pic.twitter.com/TEyWhIKO2V", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T20:19:06.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
