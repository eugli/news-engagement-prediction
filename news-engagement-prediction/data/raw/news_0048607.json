USA TODAY Sports Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook (0) drives to the basket past New York Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony (7) during the first quarter at Madison Square Garden. (Photo: Adam Hunger, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW ORLEANS – The NBA’s All-Star break is often misconstrued as the midway point of the season. \nIt’s not. \nTeams have less than 30 games on the schedule, and once Thursday’s trade deadline passes, less than two months of the regular season remain. It’s a hectic dash to the finish as teams try to resolve the unresolved. \nWho will be traded this week? New York Knicks All-Star Carmelo Anthony? Chicago Bulls All-Star Jimmy Butler? \nWill the Golden State Warriors win at least 70 games for a second consecutive season? Can the Cleveland Cavaliers hold onto first place in the East? Or can the Boston Celtics, just two games behind the Cavs in the East, overtake them? \nWho will secure the final three seeds in the East? Just 4½ games separate the sixth-place Indiana Pacers from the 11th-place Charlotte Hornets with the Bulls, Detroit Pistons, Milwaukee Bucks and Miami Heat sandwiched in between. \nIn the West, it appears seven seeds are locked up, but the eighth seed is undecided. Denver holds a 1½-game lead over the Sacramento Kings, but just 3½ games separate the Nuggets from the 14th-place Minnesota Timberwolves. That’s right, the 14th-place team in the conference is not out of the playoff race. The Dallas Mavericks, New Orleans Pelicans and Portland Trail Blazers are in the mix, too. \nWe’ve got questions. We’ve got answers to some. To other questions, well, that’s why they play games and make deals. \nWhat’s going to happen this week? \nYou’re going to hear a lot of trade chatter surrounding Anthony and Butler before the trade deadline expires on Thursday afternoon. But don’t be surprised if both remain with their teams for the rest of the season. \nAnthony has to waive his no-trade clause, and he has told management he prefers to stay with the Knicks. His salary and trade kicker (which adds money to his salary if traded) make it difficult for most teams to absorb his salary, especially a contender. \nGALLERY: BEST OF NBA ALL-STAR WEEKEND Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

But are the Celtics willing to trade at least one of their first-round picks, which are turning out to be even more valuable assets under the new collective-bargaining agreement? \n“Nothing I can do about it,” Butler said about trade discussions. “Control what you can control. Why talk about it? Why worry about it? If you’re here, you’re here. If you’re not, you’re not.” \nCan Westbrook join the Big O? \nEven if Oklahoma City Thunder star Russell Westbrook doesn’t finish the season averaging a triple-double, the fact that he inspired comparisons to the great Oscar Robertson for so much of this season is evidence enough of how good he has been. \nWith 25 games to go and the Thunder firmly in playoff position (32-25), Westbrook is averaging 31.1 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 10.1 assists. Yet if he’s going to trip up at the end on this front, and perhaps leave Robertson (1961-62) as the only player to have reached this feat, it’s the assists that will likely be his undoing. His pace has dipped since those first few months, from 11.3 assists per game in the first 23 games to 9.4 since (according to NBA.com/stats ). \nWill the Cavs hold onto first place? \nCleveland has a tough stretch ahead. Not only are they without All-Star forward Kevin Love (out six weeks after having arthroscopic surgery on his left knee on Tuesday) and shooting guard J.R. Smith (thumb surgery in late December, out until April), but the Cavs also play 15 of their remaining 27 games on the road, including trips to Boston (twice), Atlanta (twice), Houston, San Antonio and Los Angeles to play the Clippers. \nGALLERY: LEBRON JAMES THROUGH THE YEARS Facebook Posted!
