(Getty) More Tom Herman is a multimillionaire holding arguably the premier post in all of college football. But as the new Texas coach has stated in the past, his path was hardly linear.\nJust look at all of the odds jobs he has held, both in and out of football. The Dallas Morning News’ Brad Townsend did just that , and since Herman gave him an abundance of material, the writer ranked all nine of Herman’s non-coaching jobs.\n[Follow Dr. Saturday on social media: Twitter | Facebook | Tumblr ]\nThe most interesting backstory comes from No. 7 on the list, when Herman worked at Subway.\n“When people said, ‘Hey, what do you do?’ I would say, ‘I’m a Subcontractor. Or Submarine contractor.”\nAlas, due to an unfortunate, shall we say, incident, he estimates the job only lasted four to six months.\n“I used to love the pastrami,” he says. “They had those big walk-in refrigerators. I was standing in there one day, with the door shut, just throwing pastrami in my mouth.\n“It was like something out of a movie. I’ve got this bin of meat, throwing meat in my mouth, the door swings open and it’s the owner.\n“He goes, ‘Get out. Don’t come back.’ “\nHey, who can blame any high schooler for gorging on seemingly available food?\nInterestingly enough, the short-lived gig at Subway is the highest ranked non-media job Herman held. The others? Working at a batting cage and a a tuxedo shop.\nYes, the Longhorns’ new CEO has come a long way.\n– – – – – – –\nMatt Fortuna is a contributor for the Yahoo Sports blogs. Have a tip?
