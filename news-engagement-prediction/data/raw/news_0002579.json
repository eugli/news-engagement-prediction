Wenger said the severity of the Wales international's problem was not yet known. Serving the second game of a four-match touchline ban following his sending off against Burnley, the manager watched helplessly from the posh seats as Arsenal fell two behind in 13 minutes to goals from Younes Kaboul and Troy Deeney.\n\"We missed our first half, especially I feel that on the mental front we were not ready for the challenges and a bit in between and maybe we paid a heavy price for that,\" was Wenger's unimpressed verdict on the game. \n\"We were dominated in too many duels and we paid for it. I felt we didn't start sharp enough. The first goal was a soft free kick and (was) deflected in.\" \nThe Frenchman felt his side responded well after the break but although Alex Iwobi pulled one back it was not enough to stop Arsenal suffering their first home league defeat since they lost to Liverpool on the opening weekend of the season. \nAfter Chelsea drew 1-1 at Liverpool on Tuesday to stretch their lead over the chasing pack to nine points, Arsenal's visit to Stamford Bridge has a potentially defining feel to it. \nWenger, though, was putting on a brave face. \"We want to respond to our disappointment tonight and produce a good performance,\" he said. \nAnything else may not be enough to appease the vociferous section of Gunners' supporters who keep maintaining that their distinguished manager is long past his sell-by date.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T14:31:38.445+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
