A lot of the stuff that's been said is lies.\" \nLewis acknoweldged that fans will think \"badly\" of him in the light of recent revelations. \n\"Marnie is a great girl and I am clearly a fool for ruining what was something very special,\" he added. \nEarlier today, Marnie Simpson was dealt another blow after finding out that Lewis Bloor cheated on her.

Marnie said the girl contacted her (Photo: MarnieGshore/snapchat) \n“Can you believe that picture was taken the morning after? Can you actually believe that?” she said. \nThe message from the unknown girl read: “I met him outside my hotel the W Barcelona, not really knowing who he was or that he had a girlfriend. \n“We spent the early hours of the morning together at the beach and back in my hotel, it was only when my friend got back that she recognised him and told me when he left and showed me his Instagram that I realised he had a girlfriend. \n“I’m so sorry, but you can do so much better than that fool.” Marnie and Lewis at the National Television Awards last month (Photo: WENN.com) \nMarnie then thanked the girl for her honesty and asked for more detail about what they actually did. \n“Everything but and the only reason we didn’t actually have sex is because I didn’t want to if you get me,” she replied. \nMirror Online have contacted Lewis Bloor ’s representative for a comment.
