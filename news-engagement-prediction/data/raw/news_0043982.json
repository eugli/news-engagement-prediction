By: Manika Gupta | Updated: February 20, 2017 2:22 PM Akhilesh, during his rally mocked the ad and described it at length via poetry. (PTI) \nLooks like chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav is getting nervous with regard to the results of the ongoing elections. After Prime Minister Modi took jibes at all opposition parties yesterday in his Fatehpur rally, it was the turn of chief minister of Uttar Pradesh to retort with even worst barbs. Akhilesh Yadav on Monday, while addressing a rally in Rae Bareli, lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and actor Amitabh Bachchan saying that the latter should stop advertising for “donkeys” of Gujarat. The latest advertisement of Gujarat tourism features many “donkeys” and actor Amitabh Bachchan, the CM said. Akhilesh, during his rally mocked the ad and described it at length via poetry. It was an overt attack on Prime Minister Modi and his Man Friday Amit Shah . \nIn another jibe, he hit out at PM’s “Mann Ki baat’ and said, “It’s high time PM stops doing Mann Ki baat and focuses on important things”. Akhilesh also said, “Modiji respects Ganga a lot, I would like ask him to swear and tell if Varanasi receives 24 hours of electricity or not”. It clearly shows his nervousness with regard to the election outcomes. The question, however, is to what extent can people holding public offices stoop to this level? It is indeed a very poor show with all the candidates trading personal attacks on each other. We understand that Uttar Pradesh is a very important state but a certain decorum in speech is essential. \nYesterday, Prime Minister Modi had said that “Discrimination is the biggest problem in Uttar Pradesh. There is discrimination in the roots of injustice…you tell me, isn’t there a discrimination? “I am surprised. If you ask a Dalit, he says they (Akhilesh government) are not giving what is my right and it goes to OBCs. When you ask OBCs, they say he (Akhilesh) doesn’t give me what is my right but only to Yadavs. When you ask Yadavs, they say he (Akhilesh) gives only to people associated with his family and the rest to Muslims. \nAlso Watch: \n“Everyone is complaining. Brothers and sisters, this discrimination can’t be allowed. …everyone should get what is their right. ..This is ‘Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas’… Brothers and sisters, if a ‘Kabristaan’ is constructed in a village, then the ‘shamshan‘ should also be set up in the village. If one gets electricity during Ramzan, then one should get electricity in Diwali also. If one gets electricity during Holi, then one should get it during Eid also. There should not be any discrimination. It is the duty of the government to run a discrimination-free administration.” Today PM Modi’s attack shifted to Mayawati when he changed the BSP name to ‘Behenji Sampati Party’.
