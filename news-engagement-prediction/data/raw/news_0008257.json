Rowling has proved time and time again her quick wit isn‚Äôt just limited to the magical world of Harry Potter ‚Äî it also extends to her Twitter account. \nRowling has spent years demolishing haters and loudly voicing her political views on Twitter and this week was no different. \nAfter sharing an old tweet from the current US Vice President Mike Pence, Rowling‚Äôs accompanying bible verse started a huge Twitter firestorm. 'For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul?' ‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) January 29, 2017 \nMany Trump fans attempted to engage in word warfare with the best-selling author but, unsurprisingly, none of them were triumphant. \nMost Trump supporters announced they‚Äôd boycott the author with many saying they‚Äôd burn her ‚Äúbooks and movies too‚Äù to which Rowling responded brilliantly. Well, the fumes from the DVDs might be toxic and I've still got your money, so by all means borrow my lighter. pic.twitter.com/kVoi8VGEoK ‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) January 31, 2017 \nShe also decided to give out free spelling lessons. I think you mean 'shudder', unless there's a biblical character called Shutter I've forgotten. pic.twitter.com/x1uOy6n3BH ‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) January 30, 2017 \nThe Twitter burns continued for days as Trump fans valiantly tried to outwit the author. Unless you're actually a hooded chihuahua, I'm pretty sure I win on the 'not hiding' front. I quite like 'old whore', though. #Shakespearean pic.twitter.com/0pIEVfrGn7 ‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) January 30, 2017 *sighs* Well, who knows? If I try harder, I might be reincarnated as a lonely virgin hiding behind a cartoon frog. pic.twitter.com/EbocdxfJ5o ‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) January 30, 2017 \nDespite the hate Rowling received on Twitter, she thanked most of her fans for their love announcing she was off to produce more books, or as her Trump fans now call them ‚Äî‚Äúkindling.‚Äù I'd just like to thank everyone sending me lovely messages, which greatly outnumber the bad ones üòò I'm now off to produce more kindling... ‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 1, 2017 \nAnd for those that feel like they need to burn a book to support Trump but can‚Äôt get enough of Harry Potter, Rowling offered a tempting deal. Actually, we're thinking of selling them in pairs in future; a 'read one, burn one' deal for those who like the magic, but not the morals. https://t.co/EPsXoDodr7 ‚Äî J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) February 1, 2017 \nRowling‚Äôs feud with Trump fans isn‚Äôt the first Twitter war she‚Äôs taken part in. \nIn 2014, the author shut down a homophobic fan after she revealed Dumbledore was gay. \nShe also lost a number of Twitter users last year when tweeting her anger for Britain‚Äôs decision to exit the EU. \nDespite the hate, Rowling continues to use her huge social media following ‚Äî 9.34 million followers ‚Äî to advocate for what she believes in. I'll use my influence whatever way I want. This country needs to be freed of fascists on both right and left. https://t.co/vdNCFkAVGI", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T05:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:14:37.974+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
