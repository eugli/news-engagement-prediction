I’ve also never thought about how that garbage is taken down from those power lines. I guess I figured someone went up there and grabbed it? That seemed obvious. This 100 percent isn’t the case in China. In China, they use fire-spewing drones to burn the garbage down. See here:\nPhoto by Wang Hu / VCG Photo by Wang Hu / VCG This seems incredibly unsafe, right? Directing fire at power lines rubs me the wrong way. It’s a thing I know shouldn’t happen because it goes against my common sense. That said, maybe a drone that spews fire is just as dangerous as having to climb up to a power line to fetch garbage. The man controlling this drone seems pretty chill about the whole situation. He’s got a hard hat in case things go totally astray, but other than that, he isn’t decked out in complete firefighting gear, just green cargo pants and a matching jacket. Everything is fine.\nQQ I have no idea where this photo was taken, other than in Xiangyang, Hubei Province of China, and I have no clue under what pretenses this situation occurred. It certainly seems like a testing scenario, but the image’s caption says “a technician from a electric power maintenance company use the UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) to clean the high-voltage wire in Xiangyang.” I guess that answers some questions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T00:29:21.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
