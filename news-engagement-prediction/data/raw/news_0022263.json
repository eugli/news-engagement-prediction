Now, one woman is holding him to account for his claims concerning a shooting near the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, Friday. When a soldier opened fire on a machete-wielding man who shouted “Allahu Akbar” in a nearby shopping mall , POTUS shared his opinion before the full details of the incident emerged: A new radical Islamic terrorist has just attacked in Louvre Museum in Paris. Tourists were locked down. France on edge again. GET SMART U.S. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017 But the above tweet was riddled with inaccuracies. And a Facebook user under the pseudonym of Egie Wild was more than happy to point them out. ”Dear Mr. Trump, thank you for your concern,” began Wild, who slammed Trump for falsely stating the attack occurred at the Louvre Museum. “It was in the Carrousel du Louvre, which is a mall,” she wrote, noting that the semantics mattered because it was “less symbolic than what you’re implying.” Wild criticized Trump for appearing to suggest in his “ambiguous” tweet that there was a hostage situation. She also said she learned about the attack “10 hours after it happened” ― thus debunking the idea that the entire country was “on edge again.” Wild further pointed out that the suspect, 29-year-old Abdullah Hamamy (who was seriously wounded in the incident), came from Egypt. That country is not one of the seven Muslim-majority nations from where Trump’s executive order sought to ban refugees and visitors from entering the U.S. The suspect’s full intentions are not yet clear, but French Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has described the incident as “ terrorist in nature .” Wild ended her post by again sarcastically thanking Trump for his concern, before urging him not to use France “as an excuse for your arseholery.” “You’re the one encouraging fear with your distortion of truth,” she added. She never expected the message to go viral when she posted it Friday. But it had garnered more than 277,000 likes and had been shared almost as many times by Wednesday morning. And it prompted hundreds of positive comments: As for why she wrote the point-by-point take-down, Wild told BuzzFeed News that she simply “ wanted to correct ” Trump’s exaggerated tweet.
