(Photo: Lisa O'Connor/Associated Press) \nIt could be real this time. \nShe has hinted before, grown tired before, even slowed down before. \nBut if this is really the time, and the Queen of Soul is really going to retire after her next album, I don’t want to wait to say: \"Thank you, Ms. Aretha Franklin, for changing my life.\" \nHundreds of writers of songs and stories have waxed on about the soundtrack of their lives, the songs that made them, the lyrics that haunted them. \nIf they weren’t talking about you, their lives were not complete. \nI learned the lyrics to “Respect” faster than my multiplication tables. \nMy introduction to Detroit wasn’t through Motown and the plethora of fantastic music I would later embrace: Smokey Robinson (\"I Second That Emotion\"), The Supremes (\"Back In My Arms Again\"), The Temptations (\"The Way You Do The Things You Do.”) \nThey sang songs, glorious songs, but songs. You sang life. You told us to ride in a pink Cadillac and to think before we act. You showed the world Spanish Harlem. \nMy introduction to Detroit and really, truly listening to music came from Atlantic Records, from you — from a woman with a battle cry of a voice that I knew came out of church. \nI haven't just loved you, Ms. Franklin. I didn’t just love a particular song, but “Respect” became a motto, a mantra, a go-to for me my entire life. \nI taught my daughter how to clean a house to the tune of “Respect.” It set the pace and made cleaning fun. \nI taught boyfriends how to act with “Respect.” \nI didn’t get to talk to you until I arrived in Detroit, but I remember being nervous because it was you. I was interviewing you about your father, the late Dr. C.L. Franklin, 50 years after the Detroit march he helped organize that was a precursor to the Washington, D.C., Poor People’s March. \nI recall how gracious you were and how proud of your father you were a half century later. \nMs. Franklin, you’ve never been just a singer. You, as you probably know, have been an architect of emotions, combining words and music to guide us through, around or over whatever was in the way. As an adult, when I heard your plaintive but powerful affirmations of the pain and joy of love, you prepared me for heartache. Some songs make you dance. Some make you laugh. Your voice makes me feel, no matter what you’re singing. \nYou don’t just glide into songs. You smack us to attention, whether it’s the first note of “Until You Come Back To Me” or that powerful opening to \"That’s Life.” How do you DO that? There’s no easing into a journey with you. \nWhen Prince died last April, I wrote a love letter to Stevie Wonder because I wanted him to know how much he has meant to music, to the world and to my life. \nNow comes a moment when you say it’s time for you to step down. No matter how far off it is, the reality of it will be as painful as it will be unwelcome. \nBut then I remember that you don't go away. Like a shooting star, you show up when you want to: singing at President Barack Obama's inauguration in that hat that spawned a thousand wannabes, and singing the national anthem your way before the Detroit Lions-Minnesota Vikings game last November. \nThere are moments etched in time by your voice — and in those dozens of songs, I heard you telling my story without even knowing me. And that gives me some relief about not hearing you as much as I'd like. \nSo thank you, Ms. Franklin. \nYour gift has been our gift. Your voice has been our salve, our wake-up call, our prayer. \nIf this time it’s real and next year is good-bye, if this next album is the last one, I hope it sells 200 million units. \nI hope the world realizes what a powerful exit it will be. \nI hope you know that I’m just one of many millions who have been touched by your genius and grateful for your nurturing. \nAnd know that I’ll be teaching my grandchildren how to mop and dust while you’re playing — and I once again will have to explain that albums were big CDs and that you ruled in a land that sold millions of them. \nWe’ll clean and dust and sing “I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\" at the top of our lungs because I plan to teach it to them (God rest George Michael’s soul). \nSo whenever it happens, it might be be “So long,” as my grandmother used to say. But it won’t be good-bye — because, like a shooting star, I know you'll swoop in with another show, even it just for the hometown crowd. And I'll be right there. \nLong live the Queen.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T11:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:27:23.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
