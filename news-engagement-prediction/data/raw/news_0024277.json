Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 \nAfter the dust-up with Nordstrom, employees at US retailers T.J. Maxx and Marshalls were told to throw away any signs advertising merchandise from Ms Trump’s retail brand, according to The New York Times . \n“Effective immediately, please remove all Ivanka Trump merchandise from features and mix into the runs,” read a note to workers obtained by the newspaper. “All Ivanka Trump signs should be discarded.” \nMr Trump has tweeted about companies such as Boeing, Carrier and General Motors. But ethics experts say this time is different because it involves a business run by his daughter — and that raises conflict-of-interest concerns. President Donald Trump lashed out at US retailer Nordstrom after it dumped his daughter Ivanka Trump’s clothing line.

Pope Francis has rebuked Donald Trump’s proposed border wall with Mexico. Picture: AP Photo/Andrew Medichini Source: AP \nHe added: “A Christian can never say ‘I’ll make you pay for that’. Never! That is not a Christian gesture. An offence is overcome with forgiveness, by living in peace with everyone.” \nLast year, in response to an answer about then-candidate Mr Trump’s views on immigration and his intention to build a wall, Francis said a man with those views is “not Christian”. \nHe said in an interview last month that he would not form an opinion of Mr Trump until he first had a chance to see specific policies the new US president would implement. \nAs Mr Trump was taking office on January 20, Francis sent a message urging him to be guided by ethical values, saying he must take care of the poor and the outcast during his time in office. \nJEFF SESSIONS SWORN IN AS ATTORNEY GENERAL \nAlabama Senator Jeff Sessions has been sworn in as US Attorney General, despite protests from the likes of Democrat Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was formally silenced for impugning her senator colleague. \nDuring an Oval Office ceremony, Mr Trump called Sen. Sessions a man of integrity and principal, and someone who has devoted his life to the cause of justice. \nSen. Sessions was sworn in the morning after the Senate confirmed his nomination following a contentious confirmation process. The Alabama lawmaker resigned his Senate seat shortly after his colleagues approved him on a 52-47 vote that broke largely along partisan lines. \nSen. Sessions was the first sitting US senator to endorse Mr Trump. \nHe faced criticism from Democrats, including Sen. Warren, over his record on civil rights and immigration. US President Donald Trump (2nd R) watches as Jeff Sessions (L), alongside his wife Mary (2nd L), is sworn in as Attorney General by US Vice President Mike Pence. Picture: AFP Source: AFP \nRepublicans lauded his four decades of public service and his commitment to fairness and the rule of law. \nMeanwhile, just before the attorney general was sworn in, Mr Trump signed three executive actions related to criminal justice, including an order to have the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security to tackle “criminal cartels” that have spread across the nation. \nTrump announced the executive actions during a swearing-in ceremony for Attorney General Jeff Mr Trump says the plan will attempt to break the backs of criminal cartels. He’s also asking for a task force to reduce violent crime in America and a plan to stop violent crimes against law enforcement officers. He calls it a “shame” what has happened to “truly great” law enforcement officers. \nTRUMP GOES AFTER MCCAIN OVER YEMEN RAID \nMr Trump is going after Republican Senator John McCain for suggesting that last week’s US raid in Yemen wasn’t a success . \nMr Trump tweeted on Thursday that Senator McCain “should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy!” \nHe added that Senator McCain has “been losing so long he doesn’t know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in — bogged down in conflict all over the place.” Sen. McCain should not be talking about the success or failure of a mission to the media. Only emboldens the enemy! He's been losing so.... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 ...long he doesn't know how to win anymore, just look at the mess our country is in - bogged down in conflict all over the place. Our hero.. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 ..Ryan died on a winning mission ( according to General Mattis), not a \"failure.\" Time for the U.S. to get smart and start winning again! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 \nSenator McCain said on Wednesday that any operation where a $US75 million ($98.2 million) plane is lost, a Navy SEAL is killed, and there are multiple casualties, including women and children, “cannot be labelled a success.” \nHe is a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war who lost the 2008 presidential election to President Barack Obama. The Arizona Republican won re-election in November. Donald Trump has again lashed out at Republican Senator John McCain.

Picture: AFP Source: Supplied \nMore than 75 per cent of Canada’s exports go to the US. Of the 50 US states, 35 count Canada as their leading export market. \nMr Trump has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. \nCanada’s foreign minister warned the Trump administration on Wednesday that his country will retaliate if the US applies new tariffs. \nSUPREME COURT NOMINEE: ‘BAN IS DEMORALISING’ \nMr Trump has lashed out at a Democratic senator who revealed that the president’s own Supreme Court nominee had called Mr Trump’s attacks on the judiciary “disheartening” and “demoralising.” \nThe US president last week called a federal judge who temporarily blocked his travel ban a “so-called judge”, before saying the appellate court panel currently considering his executive order was “so political”. \nJudge Neil Gorsuch, nominated last week to fill a key vacancy on the Supreme Court, criticised Mr Trump’s stance during a meeting with Senator Richard Blumenthal. Mr Trump’s own confirmation team for Judge Gorsuch confirmed those comments. US Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch (right) meets with Senator Richard Blumenthal in Blumenthal's office in Washington, DC. Picture: Alex Wong/Getty Images/AFP Source: AFP \nHowever Mr Trump lashed out at Senator Blumenthal, questioning his integrity. \n“Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie), now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?” the US president tweeted on Thursday. \nSenator Blumenthal faced criticism in the past for saying he had served in Vietnam. He served in the Marine Corps Reserves during Vietnam. He apologised in 2010, saying he regretted his misstatements. Sen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave \"service\" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 \nRepublican former Senator Kelly Ayotte, who is helping with Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation, was at the meeting with the judge and Senator Blumenthal. \nShe issued a statement saying Judge Gorsuch made clear he was not referring to any specific case. But she said the nominee said he finds any criticism of a judge’s integrity and independence to be “disheartening and demoralising.” \nOn Thursday, Ms Conway said Mr Trump was “fully confident” in his Supreme Court nominee. Gorsuch: Trump's Comments on Judiciary 'Demoralizing' 2:14 \nPresident Trump?s Supreme Court pick, Judge Neil Gorsuch, said he was disappointed in the president?s remarks on the judiciary in a closed-door meeting with Sen. Richard Blumenthal. Mr. Trump has accused Mr. Blumenthal of misrepresenting his nominee. February 10th 2017 /video/video.news.com.au/News/USA/ \nSPICER MEANT ORLANDO, NOT ATLANTA, TERROR ATTACK \nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer claims he meant to say Orlando when he repeatedly referenced a terror attack in Atlanta during interviews and a press briefing last week. \nMr Spicer first referred to an Atlanta attack in an interview on January 29 on ABC’s This Week . He also named the city in reference to a terror attack during an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on January 30 and in a press briefing later that day. \nMr Spicer told ABC News in an email that he “clearly meant Orlando.” \nMr Spicer isn’t the only Trump administration official to refer to a terror attack that never happened. Ms Conway referred to a “Bowling Green Massacre” during an interview with MSNBC last week. She now says she misspoke. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly referred to a terror attack that never happened.

The new social secretary will report to Melania Trump.
