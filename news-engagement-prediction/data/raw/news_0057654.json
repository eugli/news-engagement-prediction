Setting aside his historic onstage role as Alexander Hamilton, Muñoz plays Marc Gelman, an eccentric home décor shop owner who’s traded ascots for an orange jumpsuit while serving time for involuntary manslaughter. On the all-new episode of Blindspot , airing tonight at 8 p.m. ET/PT, Gelman is brought into the FBI where he’s questioned on an unrelated charge before soon learning that his girlfriend, Marjorie, who’s been left in charge of the store, has a shocking secret of her own. In ET’s first look at the episode, Muñoz is questioned by our favorite Jane Doe (Jaimie Alexander) and Natasha Zapata (Audrey Esparza). The Hamilton star is not the only star power Blindspot has added to its cast in season two. Things kicked off with former Good Wife star Archie Panjabi joining as NSA operative Naz Kamal followed by Law & Order: SVU star Michelle Hurd coming onboard as terrorist leader Ellen “Shepherd” Briggs. Earlier this month, Hurd talked to ET about the connection between Shepherd and Kurt Weller (Sullivan Stapleton), when it was finally revealed their relationship spans decades . “She sees something familiar about Weller, and about Jane and Roman, that is reminiscent about herself,” she said. As it turns out, when Weller was a young cadet studying at the military academy, Shepherd -- real name Briggs -- funded his entire education with the hopes of recruiting him to join her cause, which we know now to be Sandstorm.

Maybe she wasn’t encouraged and wasn’t supported and she had to find her way, so she’s driven to find those people who are lost and give them a safe haven.” Of course, Blindspot is not the only place to find your favorite Hamilton stars on TV. Many of the original cast members -- Muñoz was creator Lin-Manuel Miranda’s understudy and permanent replacement -- have traded the stage for screen. While Miranda is busy filming the sequel to Mary Poppins , Daveed Diggs has been recurring on ABC’s Black-ish and narrating Netflix’s The Get Down and Renée Elise Goldsberry is set to appear in HBO’s adaptation of The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks on April 22. As for King George III, Jonathan Groff will next appear in David Fincher’s new Netflix series, Mindhunter . Blindspot airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on NBC.
