Purcell, the Washington State solicitor general, will represent the states of Washington and Minnesota. Those states filed the lawsuit that resulted in a federal district judge's decision in Seattle Friday to halt Trump's executive order nationwide. \nWashington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson said it was Purcell's idea to enlist major tech companies in the state to file briefs supporting the state's suit against Trump's executive order. \nPurcell was a Supreme Court clerk for now-retired Justice David Souter. \nAugust E. Flentje, a career trial attorney in the Department of Justice's civil division, will represent the Trump administration. \nIn his 19 years in the department, nearly all in the civil division, Flentje has worked under every president since Bill Clinton. He was part of a team that received an an award from former Attorney General Eric Holder in 2013 for \"extraordinary work\" in the legal maneuvering around the Obama administration's decision to support same-sex marriage in defiance of the Defense of Marriage Act passed by Congress. \nIn a 100-plus page legal brief to the appeals court, the White House was first represented by Acting Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Acting Associate Attorney General Chad Readler. They removed their names from the most recent court briefing after their former employer, legal firm Jones Day, filed an amicus brief regarding the travel ban. \nEach side was to be allotted 30 minutes to present oral arguments, including time for questions from the judges.
