YUM! Paczki's are a Fat Tuesday tradition, but in Detroit... this is how we do it. American Coney Island wanted to switch it up a little bit. This is a traditional famous coney dog with mustard, chili and chopped onions wrapped with a deep-fried Polish pastry instead of the regular hot dog bun we are used to seeing. @VisitDetroit @Detroit_D How about stopping at American Coney and try our sweet and savory Paczki too. #paczki #fattuesday pic.twitter.com/1hSkk6Jkvu Wake up with us every morning starting at 5am on Detroit's #1 Hit Music Station, Channel 955!
