Significantly, the ICM poll found that more Remain voters agree than disagree, at 42 per cent compared with 33 per cent. A separate survey showed 74 per cent of the public view Mr Blair unfavourably, compared with just 14 per cent who like him. Remain supporters are also heavily against him. Mr Blair made his intervention in front of a pro-Europe audience at Bloomberg’s London headquarters – the same venue where David Cameron announced plans for an In-Out referendum four years ago. The former Labour leader said that when people voted last year they had not understood the full cost of withdrawal, which included the potential break-up of the UK. ‘I accept right now there is no widespread appetite to re-think,’ he said. ‘But the people voted without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit. As these terms become clear, it is their right to change their mind. Our mission is to persuade them to do so.’ He said that in the absence of any effective opposition, Remainers would have to form a cross-party movement to keep Britain in the EU. In an attack on Jeremy Corbyn, he said: ‘The debilitation of the Labour Party is the facilitator of Brexit. I hate to say that, but it is true. What this means is that we have to build a movement which stretches across party lines.’ In an attack on Jeremy Corbyn, he said: ‘The debilitation of the Labour Party is the facilitator of Brexit' Mr Blair also insisted his decision not to apply transitional immigration controls in 2004, when Eastern European countries joined the EU, had not contributed to the Brexit vote – saying the real immigration rise came several years later. He denounced hardline Leave campaigners as ‘ideologues’ pursuing ‘Brexit at any cost’, which would leave millions worse off. But Mr Johnson accused him of ‘insulting the intelligence of the electorate’, adding: ‘This is the guy who would have taken our country into the euro with ... catastrophic consequences.’ Mr Blair’s intervention was also criticised by many on the Remain side. Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas called it ‘staggeringly unhelpful’ to those who still backed the Remain campaign. ‘To be perfectly frank it would be better if Blair butted out and left this debate to people who haven’t betrayed the trust of British people,’ she said. A Labour source said: ‘No wonder we are still trying to recover from Tony Blair’s legacy when he has such contempt for democracy.’ However, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: ‘Tony Blair is right. The challenge now is to persuade people to change their mind.’ BIZARRE AND INSULTING... TONY'S TEN CONTENTIOUS CLAIMS During his speech, Tony Blair made a series of controversial claims about Brexit and those who voted for it. Here are ten of his most contentious comments, which are sure to anger voters and which critics said proved he had lost touch with reality. VOTERS? THEY DIDN’T UNDERSTAND ‘The people voted without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit. As these terms become clear, it is their right to change their mind. Our mission is to persuade them to do so. What was unfortunately only dim in our sight before the referendum is now in plain sight. The road we’re going down is not simply Hard Brexit. It is Brexit At Any Cost.’ EUROPEAN JUDGES? NO PROBLEM ‘I can honestly say that during all my time as PM there was no major domestic law that I wanted to pass which Europe told me I couldn’t. No one would seriously argue that the European Court of Justice alone provides a reason for leaving Europe.’ MIGRATION NOT A MAJOR ISSUE ‘The practical impact of Brexit on immigration is, on analysis, less than 12 per cent of the immigration total. For many people, the core immigration question is immigration from non-European countries. We have moved to the primacy of one consideration – namely controlling immigration – without any real discussion as to why – and when Brexit doesn’t affect the immigration people most care about.’ THE SINGLE MARKET IS GREAT ‘The two great achievements of British diplomacy of the last decades in Europe – namely the single market and European enlargement – are now apparently the two things we most regret and want to rid ourselves of.’ SCOTS WILL GO THEIR OWN WAY ‘The possibility of a break-up of the UK – narrowly avoided by the result of the Scottish referendum – is now back on the table, but this time with a context much more credible for the independence case. We are already seeing the destabilising impact of negotiation over border arrangements on the Northern Ireland peace process.’ GRAVE DIAGNOSIS FOR NHS ‘We must – day in, day out – articulate the reality: The pain is large and the gain largely illusory. [Brexit] will not mean more money for the NHS but less; actually it probably means a wholesale rebalancing of our healthcare towards one based on private as much as public provision.’ WE SHOULD CONSIDER STAYING IN ‘If our Government were conducting a negotiation which genuinely sought to advance our country’s interests, that negotiation would include the possibility of Britain staying in a reformed Europe.’ LET’S REVOLT LIKE BREXITEERS ‘The one incontrovertible characteristic of politics today is its propensity for revolt. The Brexiteers were the beneficiaries of this wave; now they want to freeze it to a day in June 2016.’ BREXIT IS NOT INEVITABLE ‘[Brexiteers] will say the will of the people can’t alter. It can. They will say leaving is inevitable. It isn’t.’ REMAINERS MUST RISE UP ‘This is not the time for retreat, indifference or despair; but the time to rise up in defence of what we believe – calmly, patiently, winning the argument by the force of the argument; but without fear and with the conviction we act in the true interests of Britain.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T02:06:00.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
