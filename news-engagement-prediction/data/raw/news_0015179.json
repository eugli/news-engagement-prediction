Alright, maybe they don't, but that hasn't stopped Amazon from discounting most of the Kindle line. If you have a special bookworm in your life, you might want to take note. \nThree out of the four members of the Kindle family: The 6-inch Kindle , Kindle Paperwhite , and Kindle Voyage are all $20 off. \nThese aren't the steepest discounts we've ever seen on these products, but it's the first hardware sale Amazon has held this year. \nIf you're looking for a better deal, you can get the \"Essentials Bundle\" for either the Kindle , Kindle Paperwhite , or Kindle Voyage for $35, $40, and $45 off, respectively. \nAmazon has even discounted its recently-released Kindle for Kids Bundle by $20, taking it down to $80. \nIf your special someone is more into media than just books, Amazon has also discounted its Fire Tablet by $10 ; they've also discounted the Fire Tablet Kid's Edition by $20, which is as cheap as its ever been.
