Stephen and Seth Curry (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 1:20 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 1:20 a.m. ET \nSeth Curry, better known as the younger brother of you know who, is starting to light up the scoreboard just like his older sibling. \nThe 26-year-old guard scored 29 points Monday night to lead theÂ Mavericks to a 96-89 victory over the Heat. Seth heat check results: đĽđĽđĽ #CurryRange pic.twitter.com/8gFzfGy9Ak â NBA (@NBA) February 28, 2017 \nMeanwhile, older brother Stephen tied an NBA record for futility in a win against the 76ers. He missed all 11 of his 3-point attempts, tying an NBA record for most misses in a game without a make. \nMore on that later, because this night belonged to Seth Curry. Coupled with his career-high 31 points against the Timberwolves Friday, the younger Curry is averaging a stout 24.3 points per game in Dallas' three games since the All-Star break. \n\"He's a very, very confident young man,\" Dirk Nowitzki told reporters after Friday's game. \"He just has that attitude about him that he's supposed to score on anybody. And that's what he's been doing out there. He's been good in the pick-and-rolls. We've been seeing the entire package from him for a long time now. He's a legit scorer. I'm happy for him.\" \nThis is definitely new territory for a guard who went undrafted out of Duke in 2013, then bounced around betweenÂ short stints with more than a half dozen teamsÂ in the NBA, its summer leagueÂ and theÂ D-League before finally gettingÂ significant playing time last season in Sacramento. \nNow Seth hasÂ found a home in Dallas, where he's averaging 12Â points per game. He's also displayed some versatility. In Saturday's win against the Jazz, he only scored 13 points, but he added eight assists and seven rebounds. And he definitely has that Curry family shooting touch. \nIn fact, Seth's shooting percentageÂ of .474 and 3-point percentage of .422 this season are both higher than Steph's (.470 and .415). \nThe two-time NBA MVP certainly didn't help his stats with his poor shooting Monday night. Included in that performance were two first-quarter airballs. \nâThe weatherman said a low pressure system was coming in and I forgot to adjust to the thinness of the air,â Curry joked afterward to reporters. âIt happens.â \nFor one night, at least, Seth had clear bragging rights in the Curry family. \nStud of the night \nDeMar DeRozan scored 37 points and grabbed eight boards for the Raptors, andÂ hit the game-winning 18-foot shot with less than 2 secondsÂ remaining in Toronto'sÂ 92-91 victory over the Knicks in New York.

The 5-9 Celtics guard hit only 4-of-21Â shots from the field, scoring 19 points. That ended his franchise-record streak of 43 straight games with 20 points or more.Â He also turned the ball over sevenÂ times, although he did add sevenÂ rebounds and assists. \nHighlight â NBA (@NBA) February 28, 2017 \nWhat's next \nWarriors (49-9) at Â WizardsÂ (34-23), 7 p.m. ET â The best record in the West against the fourth-best record in the East. The Wizards' underrated backcourt of John Wall (22.9 points per game) and Bradley Beal (22.6) pose a big test for the Warriors, who will play the second game of a five-game road trip against Eastern Conference teams.
