Image: Theo Wargo/Getty Images By Nicole Gallucci 2017-02-24 00:36:03 UTC \nIn response to Donald Trump's decision to roll back guidance for public schools on transgender students and restrooms, members of the trans community and those impacted have begun sharing emotional personal accounts of harassment. SEE ALSO: Inauguration singer and her trans sister would like to talk to President Trump \nOn Thursday, prominent voices in the LGBTQ community â€” writer Janet Mock, teen activist Jazz Jennings and comedian Rhea Butcher â€” set out to raise awareness of the importance of trans protection by sharing their powerful bathroom-related anecdotes on social media after Trump rescinded the Obama-era rule allowing transgender students to use the restroom that matches their gender identity. A plea for equal access \nAs a trans woman who began her transition in middle school, Mock experienced the struggles faced by trans students first hand. \nIn a Facebook post on Wednesday, she shared an intimate letter entitled, \"For Trans Students Everywhere,\" in which she described her own transition process and offered words of support and understanding to members of the community. \n\"I had issues with bathrooms and locker room access. I was sent home repeatedly due to 'dress code violations,'\" Mock admitted. \"I was repeatedly called out of my name and misgendered daily by classmates and staff.\" In touching upon the emotional struggles she faced in school because of discrimination, Mock reminded trans students today that they're not alone. I was a trans student. I know how vital it is to feel safe, welcomed & affirmed. Equal access enabled me to attend, stay & thrive in school. \nâ€” Janet Mock (@janetmock) February 23, 2017 \n\"To young trans folk (and all the people who love them) I just want you to remember that this is your school too. You deserve to be there just as much as any other student,\" Mock wrote. \"You deserve equal access, affirmation and an education, and you must recognize and I know you know, that you are powerful. You have agency and voice. Use it to organize, combat against ignorance and resist.\" 'Stay strong' \nOn Wednesday afternoon, transgender teen Jazz Jennings â€” who recently inspired what's believed to be the world's first doll modeled after a transgender woman â€” shared a touching video to Twitter. \nAlongside her mother, Jeanette, Jazz shared that she was \"deeply affected\" by the repeal of Obamaâ€™s directive and encouraged members of the community to \"stay strong and keep moving forward\" in the fight for equality. \n\"I know that growing up I had it really hard because I wasnâ€™t allowed to use the girlâ€™s restroom,\" Jennings explained. \"I faced discrimination at such an early age and I didnâ€™t understand why I was being treated differently.\" To my trans community, stay hopeful and stand united! #ProtectTransKids ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ pic.twitter.com/HWRsN5hwbm \nâ€” Jazz Jennings (@JazzJennings__) February 22, 2017 \nJazz's adorably supportive mom also chimed in to offer her daughter and fellow parents of transgender youth a message of understanding. 'Itâ€™s about letting people exist' \nFor comedian Rhea Butcher, who identifies as cisgender and agender/non-binary, the reversal on protections for trans students struck a nerve. \"Right now the Department of Justice and the Department of Education is targeting our children,\" she said in an email. \nAs someone outside the trans community but within the LGBTQ community, she offered support and personal anecdotes about creating safe spaces in bathrooms no matter where you fall on the gender spectrum. \n\"Iâ€™m just trying to be another voice to help strengthen our community,\" she said. \nIn a long Twitter thread she detailed her own harassment experiences in women's restrooms, shared what's helped her cope over the years and encouraged anyone who needs help to reach out. \n\"This is not just about caring where people pee,\" she said. \"Itâ€™s about letting people exist, letting us live.\" I've had people threaten me, harrass me, etc in the women's public restroom 2/ \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 I was scared as a kid to go to the bathroom alone, mostly because of kidnapping scares (I watched too much tv without supervision) 4/ \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 I had a chin length bob hair cut and a too big Batman shirt and some \"surf\" shorts my mom made for me. Slip on fake Vans 6/ \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 I was terrified. I didn't know what to do. I can't remember if I said \"I'm a girl\" or if I stayed silent. I can't even remember if I left 8/ \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 In addition to being the first time I was harassed and assaulted for being in a pub restroom, this incident sticks with me 10/ \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 And this person who assaulted me for being what they thought was the wrong gender in the women's bathroom? This person was a man. 12/ \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 The bathroom fight is about so much more than peeing. It's about the right to exist. To be. /14 \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 We then have to fit through an even narrower understanding of what SOMEONE else thinks is visually appropriate for that gender 16/ \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 This happens everyday to trans, nonbinary, genderqueer folks. We have to hide or edit or confront. Eyes everywhere. Every. Single. Day. 19/ \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 My mom was always supportive. This was 1987, she did her best. Told me to ask where the women's restroom was instead of just restroom 21/ \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 She's a seamstress and made me dresses. She never once made me feel bad for not wanting her dresses, for actively despising them 23/ \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 In conclusion: we need your help. Kids need your help. See them, love them. It's more than just needing to pee. It's about being. 25/ \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 And if you need someone to talk to, @Translifeline and @TrevorProject are there for you. \nâ€” Rhea Butcher (@RheaButcher) February 23, 2017 \nOnline support for transgender students has popped up in other ways, too, as with the trending hashtag #P rotectTansKids . This is what democracy looks like: hundreds outside of the White House to tell transgender students we've got your back. #protecttranskids pic.twitter.com/KYIeBwvlBO \nâ€” ACLU National (@ACLU) February 22, 2017 \nAdditional reporting by Sasha Lekach.
