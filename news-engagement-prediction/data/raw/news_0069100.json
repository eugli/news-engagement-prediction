Best-selling author. Photographer. Fashion designer. Record label president. Nikki Sixx would be a man of many hats, if they didn't cover up his hair. His accomplishments as the founder, bass player and songwriter of Motley Crue, by themselves, are enough to make him an icon. But Nikki's insatiable desire to express himself has led him to become much more than just a music superstar.Besides the 80 million albums Crue has sold worldwide, Nikki also topped the New York Times Best Seller list for more than six months with his autobiography The Heroin Diaries. The book's soundtrack from his supergroup Sixx: A.M. spawned the song \"Life is Beautiful,\" the most played rock track of 2008. Nikki is the President of the record label Eleven Seven Music. He's a photographer, a philanthropist and the co-founder of the rock couture fashion line Royal Underground. Now, he's expanding his influence again, taking control of the airwaves with the syndicated radio show \"Sixx Sense,\" and its weekend companion, \"The Side Show Countdown with Nikki Sixx.\" Contact ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T20:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:01:57.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
