He was going 60 miles an hour in a semi and we were in a Ford Explorer,” said Belyea. \nAccording to Belyea, his wife suffered several fractures to her lower back and pelvis while he will be off work for at least a month. \n“She’s still in the hospital,” said Belyea. “The whole back of the Ford Explorer is in the back seat and if anyone would have been in the back seat they would have never made it.” \nAccording to WCNC, the driver of the truck has been charged with failure to reduce speed to avoid a collision.
