Working along new syllabic principles, a musical duo in Bengaluru have managed to integrate the tunes of a cello with that of Hindustani classical music, and the effect seems to be both rippling and unifying. Singer-filmmaker MD Pallavi has collaborated with electronic music producer and cellist Andi Otto to work on a new performance concept that blends electronic processes applied in the studio with classical vocals.\nSo, how does the idea work? Movement sensors are attached to the singer's hand and to the cello bow, enabling a 'gestural interaction' with the sounds. Describing this curious project as an extension to the human voice, Pallavi says, 'It's a new concept. We are still developing and trying to give the rhythms a better shape. We just had a test run in the city and the response has been overwhelming. Andi's extended cello bow technique, called fello, which makes use of the space around the instrument, is dovetailed with my classical vocal notes to create a completely new kind of music ' a second voice, to be precise.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:45:54.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
