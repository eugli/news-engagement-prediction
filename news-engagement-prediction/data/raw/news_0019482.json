Since March 2016, no tests have been carried out by the Spanish Agency for Health Protection in Sport (AEPSAD) in the country's second division, and only 57 tests have been conducted at La Liga clubs not competing in Europe. The World Anti-Doping Agency said in a statement that: 'The lack of testing in a country with one of the leading football leagues worldwide for a period of almost 12 months is alarming.' Spain's anti-doping body have said they are hoping to resume testing in football very soon But AEPSAD told Reuters on Friday it expected to see changes take place before the end of the month. 'This situation will be resolved once the Royal Decree is approved to implement the 2015 World Anti-Doping Code, with which WADA will then proceed to declare AEPSAD compliant with such code and the ban on Madrid's anti-doping lab will be lifted,' it said in a statement.
