The 2:23 trailer gives us a much closer look at the story than we’ve been previously given. The game features the voices of Ashly Burch ( Adventure Time ), Kosha Engler ( Moonshot ) and David Harewood ( Supergirl ). Take a look at the latest synopsis. \n“Take on the role of skilled hunter Aloy as you explore a vibrant and lush world inhabited by mysterious mechanized creatures. Embark on a compelling, emotional journey and unravel mysteries of tribal societies, ancient artifacts and advanced technologies that will determine the fate of this planet, and of life itself.” \nThe game follows Aloy of the Nora tribe that has been massacred by an unknown group of masked people. Aloy defies her tribe’s advice about praying to the Goddess for help, and decides to find out what’s going on by herself. She leaves her sacred lands and heads to Meridian to solve the mystery. The enemy leader is raising up ancient machines to take back what he believes to be his, by taking control of the machines that roam the land. He’s also creating something larger that threatens everyone’s existence. The game explores the juxtaposition of a primitive world of hunters and advanced technology. \nThe Guerrilla Games and Sony Interactive Entertainment game will be released exclusively for the PlayStation 4. If you pre-order, you’ll get weapon and armor modifications with the Nora Machine Trapper Pack. Horizon Zero Dawn debuts on February 20, 2017. You can order your copy by clicking here .
