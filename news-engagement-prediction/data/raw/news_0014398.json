The doctors performed the post-mortem under the open sky despite having a separate mortuary. Representative image. ALWAR: In a shocking act, doctors conducted post-mortem of a person under the open sky in Bardod community health centre (CHC) of Alwar district , which was inaugurated by the first President of India, Rajendra Prasad . The doctors performed the post-mortem under the open sky despite having a separate mortuary. The body was lying on the ground in the open and the doctors had to literally bend to conduct the post-mortem. The police had found the body of this person on Monday morning, who was identified as Om Prakash . Prakash had been missing since Sunday evening when he left his house informing his family that he was going to attend a marriage function. He did not return to his house after that. His body was found in the backyard of a dharamshala (inn). Police said that a passer-by informed the family about Prakash's body lying in the backyard of the inn. His family members informed the police that Prakash was addicted to liquor and that he may have died while falling from the rooftop of the inn under the influence of liquor. The police took the body for post-mortem to CHC Bardod. But the scene there was horrifying for the relatives. The doctors conducted the post-mortem on the body under the open sky. When contacted, hospital incharge Dr Sapna Yadav said that they do not have a mortuary. However, villagers said that there is a mortuary in the hospital. Dr Sapna said that sarpanch of the village had promised to give donation with which a mortuary was to be constructed. However, even Bardod sarpanch Sunil Bhardwaj said that a mortuary was constructed in the hospital some 30 years ago, and still post-mortems were conducted under the open sky because of adamant CHC administration.
