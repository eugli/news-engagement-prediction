Fans are speculating that Jessa's husband Ben Seewald will follow in his father-in-law Jim Bob Duggar's footsteps and get involved in the legislature somehow. \nJB was an elected member of Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2002, and while Ben hasn't made his intentions clear on his path yet, it's pretty evident from his social media posts that he considers himself quite involved in politics already. \nMore from CafeMom: Jill Duggar & Derick Dillard in Hot Water Again Over Donation Requests \nBen hasn't shown political allegiance to President Trump like his brother-in-law Derick Dillard has, but he has shown that he's not entirely opposed to injecting his faith into the political arena. Here he is last fall, proclaiming that only Jesus can \"make America great again.\" A post shared by Ben Seewald (@ben_seewald) on Aug 3, 2016 at 8:29pm PDT \nHe also has an associate's degree in political science from National Park Community College in Arksansas, just in case you were wondering. \nMore from CafeMom: Jessa Duggar Gushes Over What a Great Dad Ben Seewald Is \nIt would be interesting to see if he decided to run for office in some capacity, or if he'd go the lobbying route like his brother-in-law Josh Duggar did. We're just hoping that if he and Jessa end up in DC like Josh and Anna did, he makes better decisions than Josh made. \nNo one wants to see that happen again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:44:35.006+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
