The same threadbare straw man has been clumsily wheeled out and the same mantra repeated. The same song from the same hymn book once again fills the air. Yet the rhetorical stance taken by those opposed to the renaming of Bristol’s Colston Hall is less a cogent argument and more a tacit accusation – attack camouflaged as a form of defence.\nThe argument goes like this. To seek to rename the concert hall , or to want to topple the statue of Edward Colston that overlooks the docks from which Bristol’s slave ships once sailed is – somehow – to seek to erase a part of the city’s history. It is a contemptibly disingenuous position and Colston’s defenders know it. Buildings are not named in order to help us remember our history, they are named to honour rich and powerful men; and sometimes they are men whom we should revile rather than honour.\nThe identical strategy was deployed last year by those determined to ensure that the squat little statue of Cecil Rhodes, affixed to Oxford’s Oriel College, was not permitted to fall. Rhodes was saved, not by the force of argument, but by the same commodity that encouraged his 19th-century defenders to tolerate his crimes and turn blind eyes to his abuses – money. And money is what for centuries has persuaded Bristol’s civic leaders to focus monomaniacally on the undoubted philanthropy of Edward Colston. Those who want to rename Colston Hall, like the students who want to topple Cecil Rhodes (not that I agree completely with them or their tactics), are campaigners for a fuller, more honest remembrance of history, not its erasure.\nThe real meaning of Rhodes Must Fall | Amit Chaudhuri Read more \nThe true erasure of Bristol’s critical role in slavery and the slave trade began centuries ago, when slavery was intentionally re-imagined as a “respectable trade”. In the 18th century, a nationwide propaganda campaign attempted to methodically wipe out the truth and convince an increasingly morally queasy nation that slavery was essentially benign. Slavery’s propagandists argued in pamphlets and books that the hundreds of thousands of Africans who toiled on Britain’s Caribbean plantations had better diets, better homes and more free time than the poor of England. Africans, they suggested, actively preferred slavery over freedom and were a people naturally suited to bondage and the whip.\nNo British city is more wilfully blind to its history than Bristol. Having lived in Liverpool and London, two cities whose connections to slavery run deep, I can say that Bristol stands head and shoulders above the competition in its capacity to obscure its past and obfuscate its history. For three centuries, slavery has been hidden behind that wall of lies and denial, but the biggest lie of all was given literal solidity when it was cast into bronze and affixed to the pedestal upon which stands the statue of Edward Colston . The unctuous dedication on the plaque describes Colston as “one of the most virtuous and wise sons of the city”.\nBristol Cathedral 'would consider' removing slavery-linked Colston window Read more \nThose words were written in 1895, by which time Edward Colston had been in his grave for 174 years, and Bristol was perhaps two thirds of the way through her long age of denial about the centrality of slavery and the slave trade to its past and its wealth. Edward Colston was neither virtuous nor wise. Amoral and avaricious, he was also – let us not forget – a killer. Thousands of Africans died to generate the wealth he later lavished on his home city. The real victims of forgetting are the men, women and children who were enslaved by Colston, a deputy governor of the Royal African Company – the entity that transported more Africans into slavery than any in British history.\nThe current refurbishment of Colston Hall , due to be completed in 2020, is, of course, the perfect opportunity and the right moment for the venue to be renamed. I know black Bristolians who refuse to set foot in Colston Hall while it carries the name of a slave trader and to their enormous credit, Massive Attack , Bristol’s most innovative and successful band, have for years refused to play there.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Robert Del Naja of Massive Attack.

What message does that send out about us and our respect for others? Names matter, gestures matter and uncomfortable histories do not simply go away. But there are other pressing reasons why Bristol needs to take this step.\nBristol’s record on racial equality is the worst of any major British city. A report jointly written by Manchester’s Centre on Dynamics of Ethnicity and the Runnymede Trust, concluded that the 16% of Bristol’s population who are BAME – black, Asian and minority ethnic – are subject to what it calls an “ethical penalty”. Non-white Bristolians gain fewer academic qualifications in the city’s schools, they find fewer opportunities in the local job market and suffer inequalities in health provision, compared to the city’s white communities. Dr Nissa Finney, of the CDE, noted that the extent of Bristol’s “ethnic inequalities is striking and it has not improved in the last 15 years”.\nRiot flashpoint to housing hotspot: hipsters help to bring St Pauls back to life Read more \nColston is an issue that has deeply divided Bristol , which is perhaps appropriate as few cities are as divided as this one. Clifton, the Georgian quarter overlooking the Avon Gorge, is almost a city in itself – a middle-class citadel high on the hill, towering over the largely white, working class and comparatively deprived areas of Bedminster, Ashton and Southville. To the east is St Pauls – run down but being rapidly gentrified, it is the long-established centre of the city’s West Indian population.\nThe socioeconomic and racial zoning of Bristol is worthy of the Deep South, and that geographic distance is the enabler of profound differences of perspective. From the Georgian squares of Clifton, Edward Colston might seem like merely a feature of the city’s rich heritage. From St Pauls, Bristol’s seemingly undimmed determination to honour his memory and marginalise his crimes appears insensitive, even callous.\nWe need to be honouring our commitments to the life chances of the thousands of minority children currently in Bristol schools, not a long dead purveyor of human flesh.\nWe are better than this. I look forward to 2020 when, as part of a mixed-race, multicultural Bristolian crowd, I hope to finally watch Massive Attack perform in their home city – in the venue formerly known as Colston Hall.\n• Comments will be switched on later\nBristol Opinion Slavery Massive Attack comment   Share   Reuse this content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:25:01.318+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
