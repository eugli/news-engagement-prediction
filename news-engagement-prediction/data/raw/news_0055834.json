Uhh?! He is a Hollywood elitist.” \nIn fact, according to his financial disclosure during the election campaign, Trump has a $110,228 pension from the Screen Actors Guild — not totally off the mark. \nClooney dubbed Trump a “demagogue,” adding that Streep “has every right to speak up” since “she was an American citizen long before she was an icon.” Related George Clooney hits out at Donald Trump, labels him ‘an opportunist’ and ‘a xenophobic fascist’ \nClooney, who endorsed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election, then picked a few bones with Trump senior advisor Steve Bannon, saying, “Steve Bannon is a failed film writer and director. That’s the truth, that’s what he’s done. He wrote a Shakespearean rap musical about the LA riots that he couldn’t get made. He made a lot of money off of Seinfeld. He’s elitist Hollywood, I mean that’s the reality.” \n“We have Donald Trump, which is…hard to imagine,” Clooney concluded. “It catches in your throat. But we’ll fix it. We have to.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:29:00.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
