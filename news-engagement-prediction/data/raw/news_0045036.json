'Inseparable' \nTheir four children issued a statement urging people for help after the robbery, confirming their mother had been killed. \n\"Our parents were inseparable and their relationship was something to aspire to,\" it read. \n\"It is hard to understand that on their community farmland estate, with rolling hills and endless nature, and neighbours 100m away, that something so violent could happen. Please keep us in your thoughts and prayers.\" \nMrs Solik had returned to Wales for the funeral of her father, Glyn Savage, last month. \nThe couple, who also had two grandchildren, initially emigrated on a two-year visa, but decided to stay in South Africa.
