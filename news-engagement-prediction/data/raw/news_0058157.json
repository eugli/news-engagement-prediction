Iceland’s President has sparked a global showdown on pineapple pizza Gavin Fernando, news.com.au February 22, 2017 2:12pm \nAS WE speak, our global leaders are grappling with some pretty important stuff. \nDonald Trump is unveiling his plan for a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigrants in the United States. \nOver in the UK, Theresa May is preparing to trigger Britain’s official formal exit talks with the European Union. \nOur own Malcolm Turnbull has just reaffirmed Australia’s commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, saying the country will not give into pressure on the matter. \nBut the significance of such issues pales in comparison to the firestorm of a debate started by Icelandic President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson. \nLast week, while answering questions from pupils at a school in Iceland’s north, Mr Guðni was asked by a bold student for his thoughts on pineapple pizza. \nHe answered the deeply divisive question by saying he was “fundamentally opposed” to the idea, going as far as to say he would ban the tropical fruit from pizza if he could. \nThe storm of controversy was immediate. Iceland's President has said he would ban pineapple on pizza. The type of guy that should be leading us here in the UK — Mark Lawrence (@MLawrenceJourno) February 21, 2017 @MLawrenceJourno I happen to love pineapple on my pizza. I'm going to start a protest outside the Icelandic embassy in London. #iampineapple — Genius Writer (@geniuswriter1) February 21, 2017 How can y'all not like pineapple and pizza what the hell — GORE WHOREㅤ (@MadamMortus) February 21, 2017 PINEAPPLE DOES GO ON PIZZAPINEAPPLE DOES GO ON PIZZAPINEAPPLE DOES GO ON PIZZAPINEAPPLE DOES GO ON PIZZAPINEAPPLE DOES GO ON PIZZA \nIt also inspired new inventions constituting madness of the highest order. Pineapple on Pizza is alright but have you ever tried Pizza on Pineapple? pic.twitter.com/tqQNlDmKRr — 月 Mirage (@ThatGuyMirage) February 20, 2017 \nSeriously. It was a bloodbath. \nThis is no laughing matter. The Pineapple On Pizza debate has plagued humans for decades, and a consensus has never officially been reached. \nTo throw yourself into the firing line and admit to one preference over the other is arguably one of the most dangerous things a human being can do. And that includes getting a Twitter account. \nLong story short, the Icelandic leader was forced to release a statement on the issue clarifying his stance , offering some sort of neutral pineapple-scented white flag. \n“I like pineapples, just not on pizza,” he wrote on Facebook, in both English and Icelandic. “I do not have the power to make laws which forbid people to put pineapples on their pizza. I am glad that I do not hold such power. \n“Presidents should not have unlimited power. I would not want to hold this position if I could pass laws forbidding that which I don´t like. I would not want to live in such a country. \n“For pizzas, I recommend seafood.” Let’s not even touch on that last remark. \nMr Guðni has enjoyed huge popularity since he was elected President of Iceland last June. \nHe’s known for his informal leadership style, and was even once seen stopping by a Domino’s on his way home from the office. \nPerhaps his likeable nature has saved him this time. But it’s safe to assume people won’t be quite so forgiving in future. \nBut hey, at least you’re not leaving in Sweden. @conradhackett In Sweden we've already fought the pineapple culture war and have reached the next level of enlightenment: Banana curry pizza pic.twitter.com/A3pmkp8eCD — Aron Strandberg (@aronstrandberg) February 21, 2017 \nAnd on that note, it’s time to log off.
