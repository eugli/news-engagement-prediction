'So with black and minority ethnic representation we are sort of proportionate in the civil service as a whole at 12 per cent, but only about 4 per cent in senior civil service positions, and that's not enough.' High spirits: The monarch beamed as she was seen in a dramatic blue and white floral gown as she greeted guests Royal: The 90-year-old, wearing a dazzling necklace of pearls and a stunning brooch, seemed in high spirits for the event Ten women out of a total 39 senior civil servants currently hold the post of permanent secretary, a position which involves heading the day-to-day running of a central government department and acting as an adviser to the relevant secretary of state. Antonia Romeo, who is due to take up her position as the newest female permanent secretary in March for the Department for International Trade, said women had gained prominence in the service over the past 20 years due to flexible working arrangements. She said: 'I joined the Civil Service in 2000 and at the time there was much less opportunity to do things like job sharing, which meant that if you wanted to do the really tough jobs, you had to work full time unless you had a particularly understanding boss. Smiling: The Queen seemed to enjoy the conversation as she held a glass of wine and chatted with guests 'I was lucky because I worked with some supportive and very understanding diversity-friendly bosses early in my career when I was having children.

Ten women out of a total 39 senior civil servants currently hold the post of permanent secretary He said: 'Currently, over 40% of the Senior Civil Service are women. But there is still more to do, which is why we are determined to build on our progress to date by removing any remaining barriers for women and other under-represented groups in the Civil Service.' Baroness Evelyn Sharp became the first female permanent secretary in 1955, having entered the Civil Service fast stream in 1926, one year after women were first allowed to apply.
