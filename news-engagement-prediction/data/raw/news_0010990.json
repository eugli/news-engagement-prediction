The NHS has been asked to draw up plans to save £22bn \n“The NHS has been desperately short of capcity for the last few years - its crazy to close A&Es when there simply isn’t capacity to cope with these patients elsewhere.” \nI ntroducing such changes at a time of such pressures on services risked public safety, he warned. \nStripping out acute services could only be safely done, if new services had already been created closer to home, he said. \n“The idea that closing A&E departments will stop people being ill is mad, it’s all being done the wrong way round,” Dr Moulton said. \n“You can’t stop people having a heart attack by closing their A&E - it’s like councils giving people a small bin in the hope it will make people have less rubbish” \nIn recent weeks, record numbers of hospitals have ordered ambulances to be diverted to other hospitals,with almost half of NHS trusts declaring a major alert in January. \nIt comes as official figures show one in 14 people in England is now on an NHS waiting list. \nThe 3.7 million people waiting for surgery is a 44 per cent rise on 2012, with one in 10 people waiting longer than 18 weeks for treatment to start. \nThe total number of \"long waiters\", for whom the 18-week target in England has been missed, now exceeds 350,000 - a rise of 163 per cent in four years, research for the BBC shows. \nSimon Stevens recently told MPs that hospitals were not being \"feckless\" but under heavy pressure Credit: PA \nA nnual figures show the number of patients stuck on trolleys in A&E units for more than 12 hours has doubled in two years, with a tripling in cases among the elderly, \nLast month a woman died of a cardiac arrest after enduring a 35 hour wait on a trolley at Worcestershire Royal Hospital. \nThe hospital’s A&E department has become overwhelmed so often that it has diverted ambulances to other units on 44 occasions since December, official figures show. \nYet the trust running the hospital intends to centralise A&E services at the unit, downgrading the casualty department at Alexandra Hospital, Redditch so it will only take adult emergency cases. \nKing George Hospital in Essex will see its A&E unit closed by 2019, while A&E units at City hospital in Birmingham and Sandwell District General Hospital in Birmingham will both close, to be replaced at a new Midland Metropolitan hospital next year. \nOther trusts planning to downgrade A&E units, so they can only take minor injuries, include Dewsbury and District Hospital in Yorkshire, Ealing Hospital, in London and Poole Hospital in Dorset, the research shows. \nAt 26 more hospitals across the country, no decision has been taken about which A&Es will be closed or downgraded. \nIn many cases, several units are going “head to head” for survival of their casualty department, with no decision taken yet about where to centralise services. In total, around 24 of the 33 hospitals at the centre of discussions are likely to see the loss of full A&E services, Health Service Journal said. \nIt comes amid severe strain on England’s 175 A&E units, and concern from ministers that too many patients are ending up in A&E because they cannot get a GP appointment. \nWeekly A&E Chart \nB efore Christmas, the health service was ordered to stop most planned operations for at least a month, in a bid to get bed occupancy down to 85 per cent and prevent hospitals becoming overwhelmed with patients. \nBut latest figures show occupany rates are now at 95.5 per cent, with fears that pressures will grow again with freezing temperatures expected to return this month. \nMeanwhile, the number of life-saving operations cancelled at the last minute has reached a new high, with more than 4,000 urgent procedures put on hold last year. \nAn NHS spokesman said: \"The number of people seeking urgent care is on the rise so overall we expect the range of services available to them to expand over coming years. \n\"Within that overall expansion, it may be possible to improve care and save lives with some concentration of specialist urgent services. This approach has increased the chances of surviving a major trauma in this country by 50 per cent.” \nHe said he did not expect significant numbers of A&E changes in the years ahead, with one of the decisions - involving centralisation of services at Sandwell and City Hospitals - taken some years ago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T08:14:20.715+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
