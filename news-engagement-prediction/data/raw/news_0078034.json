The Wests Tigers centre met with league officials in September last year, where he denied the allegations against him. But Kent says the evidence is now weighted heavily against him.\n“He’ll be rubbed out for life on Friday,” Kent said on Fox Sports NRL 360 . “The NRL is in possession of evidence that he was backing opposition players to be first try-scorer in games he was playing.”\n“Todd Greenberg came out last year very strongly and said that anybody caught match fixing will not have a place in the game.”\nIt’s alleged Simona had associates place bets on opposition players he was marking to score the first try.\nThe Simona incident isn’t the first time the game has been drawn into match fixing allegations. Strike Force Nuralda was created to investigate sports betting’s growing grip on the game, as several NRL games were spotlighted as suspicious.\nSimona is the first name to be caught in the net, but journalist Phil Rothfield says a life is an unfair punishment, at least until the full details emerge.\n“I don’t think you can give a 24-year-old kid life when we don’t know the size of his bets,” Rothfield said.\n“It’s not match fixing, he’s done the wrong thing.”\nTim Simona in happier times.   \nBut Kent believes to save the integrity of the game the NRL must come down firm on Simona.\n“It doesn’t matter. Simona has backed the opposition. It can’t get any worse,” Kent replied.\n“There’s been a screenshot of a phone of him taking a bet.”\nKent also reported in an article for The Daily Telegraph that NRL chief Greenberg has taken the unprecedented step of preventing betting companies from generating markets on areas of the game that can be potentially manipulated by match fixers — “exotic bets”.\nMarkets such as most runs head to head, most run metres head to head, over/under run metres, over/under tackles, player versus player points, 40/20 kicks and first-scoring plays are set to be removed.\nThere’s also a move to ban betting on Holden Cup games, where important player changes can have a huge impact on the result, and team changes aren&apos;t as well known as in the NRL.\nMeanwhile the bad news for the Wests Tigers continues, with news forward Kyle Lovett has been handed a four-game ban.\nLovett was also fined $15,000 for pleading guilty to drug possession.\nThe Tigers announced the punishment on Tuesday, with his Auckland Nines and trial suspension counting as two of the four games.\nLovett pleaded guilty to the charge earlier this month and was given a six-month good behaviour bond without a conviction being recorded.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-03-01T02:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:47:51.307+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
