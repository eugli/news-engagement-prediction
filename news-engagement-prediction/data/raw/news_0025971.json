(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP) \nAdele opened the 59th annual Grammy Awards with a straight-forward performance of her hit “Hello” before James Corden took the stage and things took a turn for the political. \nCorden took the stage and after a purposefully messy entrance, “The Late Late Show” host began to rap about the show and the stars in the audience. At the end of his rap Corden turned political, sharing a message of unity and quipping about President Donald Trump. \n“…With president Trump we don't know what comes next,” he said mid-rap. “We can survive by sticking together.” \nAfter Corden finished his introduction, Jennifer Lopez presented the first award of the evening and also talked politics. More on this... \n“At this particular point in history, our voices are needed more than ever,” she said hinting at the Trump presidency. \nJLo presented the award for best new artist to Chance The Rapper. \nParis Jackson then took the stage and stated to the audience, \"We can really use this type of excitement at a pipeline protest, guys.\" 2017 Grammy Awards: Most eye-catching red carpet looks \nThe Grammys are known for some seriously wacky, sexy and attention-grabbing red carpet looks. Here are the looks that caught our eye this year. \nBut all eyes on Sunday night were on Adele and Beyonce, who are both competing for album of the year. \nIt’s the third time Beyonce is nominated for album of the year, an award given to few R&B-based performers and only two hip-hop acts in the Grammy's 59-year history. \nShe was nominated for the top prize in 2010 with \"I Am ... Sasha Fierce\" (losing to Taylor Swift) and in 2015 with \"Beyonce\" (Beck was the surprise winner). Beyonce's \"Lemonade\" album is competing Sunday, along with its hit \"Formation\" for record and song of the year. \nBeyonce's main competition is Adele, who won album, song and record of the year in 2010. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:31:14.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
