On Sunday, he said what Fowler described was \"abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in.\" Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick at the Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai, India, in January 2016. Danish Siddiqui - Reuters \nPromising an \"urgent\" and independent investigation, he announced Attorney General Eric Holder would lead the charge. Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member, will also help investigate and shared her email address on Twitter. \n\"It should be something they're smart enough to overcome in the long term,\" George Peterson, founder and CEO of consulting and research firm AutoPacific, Inc., told NBC News. â€” travis kalanick (@travisk) February 20, 2017 \nNot only is Uber's reputation at stake, but the company also stands to lose more customers after the #DeleteUber hashtag started trending again. \nIn the past day, over 3,000 users have sent out a tweet using the #DeleteUber hashtag , generating nearly 50 million impressions, according to Keyhole, a Twitter tracking service. \nThe social media campaign first gained traction after critics interpreted Uber as having broken a taxi workers' strike at a New York airport amid protests of Trump's executive order temporarily banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. \nThe movement was said to have spurred 200,000 customers to delete their accounts in protest and was later followed by Kalanick quitting President Trump's business advisory council. \nUber made the most of the holiday weekend to quickly mobilize its crisis response plan and control the narrative, however both Peterson and Levick say what will matter the most is the resolution. \nVital to that will be ensuring Holder has everything he needs to complete an independent and thorough investigation. \n\"He will have to put something out in the coming weeks or months... in it, there has to be resolutions. There has to be actions the company can take,\" Levick said, and they have to show them through their corporate social responsibility. \nOne way, he suggested, is to find a way to recruit more female engineers to work at Uber. The same, he said, should go for other companies in Silicon Valley where there is a gender disparity in engineering. Only then, will Uber be really able to turn the page, he said.\"The critical strategy they are going to need to apply is: 'It's a new day here. That was then. This is now.\" Alyssa Newcomb ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:47:31.325+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
