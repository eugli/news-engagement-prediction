Watch | May says Trump 100 per cent behind NATO 00:19 \nP rime Minister Theresa May trumpeted the UK's record of hitting the 2 per cent figure during her recent visit to Washington to meet US President Donald Trump, who has complained of European Nato members failing to pull their weight financially. \nThe figure was revealed in the IISS annual Military Balance report, unveiled a day before a meeting of Nato defence ministers - including the UK's Sir Michael Fallon - in Brussels. Nato | Who pays? \nL aunching the report, IISS director general John Chipman said: \"In 2016, only two European Nato states - Greece and Estonia - met the aim to spend 2 per cent of their GDP on defence, down from four European states that met this measure in 2015. \n\"The UK dipped slightly below this at 1.98 per cent, as its economy grew faster in 2016 than its defence spending. \n\"Nonetheless, the UK remained the only European state in the world's top five defence spenders in 2016. \n\"If all Nato European countries were in 2016 to have met this 2 per cent of GDP target, their defence spending would have needed to rise by over 40 per cent.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T17:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:33:13.173+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
