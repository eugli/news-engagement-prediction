The two companies merged a few years back when they released a brand-new take on Daredevil , and a slew of heroes have since gotten the Netflix-Marvel treatment since. This year, Iron Fist will be the next superhero to get a standalone series, and it seems a few new photos of Danny Rand have hit the Internet. UP NEXT: Finn Jones Talks Fighting In Marvel's Iron Fist \nOver on Reddit , Internet sleuths have put their skills to the test and uncovered two pictures of Finn Jones as the hero. The two pictures show the actor shirtless as he goes through some martial arts moves. In both images, Jones is showing off Iron Fist’s massive chest tattoo of a dragon, and his lean physique looks less bulky than over heroes like Luke Cage. Rather than carrying around massive muscles, Iron Fist uses his wiry frame to execute insane moves, and his connection to spiritual energy doesn’t hurt his offensive skills either. \nWhen it comes to fighting, fans can expect to see a variety of martial arts styles used in Iron Fist . Last year, Jones spoke to the press about his training for the show, and the actor said he was ready to kick butt. \n“There's all sorts,” Jones said, referring to the type of fighting seen on Iron Fist. “There's Kung Fu, wushu, dragon, tiger, monkey; there's so many different forms of martial arts that we're approaching it.” \n“It takes a martial artist a lifetime to learn this stuff, and I've had a month. It's been really intense, but really fun. The way I approach it is, it's like learning a dance routine. You learn the steps, you get that in your mind and your body, you learn the choreography, and then you add acting on top of it, and all that development, and then you turn up on the day and you just kick ass.” \nMORE DEFENDERS: The Connection to Marvel Movies / Where We Find Daredevil / Where We Find Luke Cage / How Jessica Jones Knows Daredevil / Luke Cage & Iron Fist / Defenders Team Photo Easter Egg Revealed / New Defenders Team Photo / Iron Fist's Defenders Role Revealed / Defenders Assembled! / New MCU Defenders Comic Book Coming / Iron Fist Trailer \nJones will then reprise the role for Marvel’s The Defenders , which teams Iron Fist up with Marvel Television’s other Netflix stars: Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), and Luke Cage (Mike Colter). \nMarvel’s The Defenders premieres later in 2017.
