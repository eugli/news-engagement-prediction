I made a bunch of regrettable decision.\"\nThe former emergency room doctor at Royal Victoria Regional Health Centre pleaded guilty to writing hundreds of bogus prescriptions for the dangerous painkiller fentanyl. He also pleaded guilty to one count of trafficking.\nGebien recruited strangers, including taxi drivers, drug addicts, and three other RVH employees to help with the scheme. Those hospital workers lost their jobs.\n\"I’m scared, frightened worried and I don't know what is going to happen,\" Gebien said outside of the courthouse.\nThe 46-year-old admitted to writing fake prescriptions for 445 fentanyl patches between August 2013 and November 2014.\nThe Crown wants Gebien to spend eight years in prison, telling the judge \"this is trafficking in the most serious drug the courts are dealing with.\"\nCrown attorney Karen Jokinen pointed out the seriousness of the offence, asking \"if you don't know who you are giving the drug to, what kind of a doctor are you?\"\nThe defence wants a suspended sentence and a conditional sentence on both charges, which could mean no jail time.\nThey call it \"an exceptional\" set of circumstances and pointed to his former drug addiction. Gebien's lawyer told the court \"the acts are serious, no question, but it is, utmost important, to consider he was in throes of serious addiction at the time.\"\nGebien will be back in court on April 18 for sentencing.\nPhotos Dr. Darryl Gebien can be seen at the Barrie, Ont. courthouse on Friday, Feb. 17, 2017.
