Auto Loan Bubble Bursting, And Lenders Know Where Your Car Is At All Times by StalingradandPoorski - Feb 21, 2017 7:47 PM \nAccording to the latest data, auto loan delinquencies are now at levels not seen since the last financial crisis . In Latest \"Military Escalation\" China Prepares Deployment Of SAM Batteries On South China Sea Islands Feb 22, 2017 7:46 AM 0 SHARES \nIn China's latest test of the US response to its escalating claims of islands in the South China Sea, Reuters reports that Beijing has \"nearly finished building almost two dozen structures on artificial islands in the South China Sea that appear designed to house long-range surface-to-air missiles.\" Predictably, such a development will likely raise questions about whether and how the United States will respond, given its vows to take a tough line on China in the South China Sea. The structures appear to be 20 meters (66 feet) long and 10 meters (33 feet) high. \nOfficial cited by Reuters said the new structures were likely to house surface-to-air missiles that would expand China's air defense umbrella over the islands. They did not give a time line on when they believed China would deploy missiles on the islands. \"It certainly raises the tension,\" Poling said. \"The Chinese have gotten good at these steady increases in their capabilities.\" \nChina's Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands in the South China Sea \nBuilding the concrete structures with retractable roofs on Subi, Mischief and Fiery Cross reefs, part of the Spratly Islands chain where China already has built military-length airstrips, could be considered a military escalation, the U.S. officials said in recent days, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"It is not like the Chinese to build anything in the South China Sea just to build it, and these structures resemble others that house SAM batteries, so the logical conclusion is that's what they are for,\" said a U.S. intelligence official, referring to surface-to-air missiles. \nGreg Poling, a South China Sea expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said in a December report that China apparently had installed weapons, including anti-aircraft and anti-missile systems, on all seven of the islands it has built in the South China Sea. \nOn Tuesday, the Philippines said Southeast Asian countries saw China's installation of weapons in the South China Sea as \"very unsettling\" and have urged dialogue to stop an escalation of \"recent developments.\" Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay did not say what provoked the concern but said the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations, or ASEAN, hoped China and the United States would ensure peace and stability. \nA Pentagon spokesman said the United States remained committed to \"non-militarization in the South China Sea\" and urged all claimants to take actions consistent with international law. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Wednesday he was aware of the report, though did not say if China was planning on placing missiles on the reefs. \"China carrying out normal construction activities on its own territory, including deploying necessary and appropriate territorial defense facilities, is a normal right under international law for sovereign nations,\" he told reporters. \nTillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that China's building of islands and putting military assets on them was \"akin to Russia's taking Crimea\" from Ukraine. In his written responses to follow-up questions, he softened his language, saying that in the event of an unspecified \"contingency,\" the United States and its allies \"must be capable of limiting China's access to and use of\" those islands to pose a threat. \nA U.S. intelligence official said that while the structures do not pose a significant military threat to U.S. forces in the region, given their visibility and vulnerability, the construction is a political test of how the Trump administration would respond, he said. \"The logical response would also be political â€“ something that should not lead to military escalation in a vital strategic area,\" the official said. \nChas Freeman, a China expert and former assistant secretary of defense, said he was inclined to view such installations as serving a military purpose - bolstering China's claims against those of other nations - rather than a political signal to the United States. \"There is a tendency here in Washington to imagine that it's all about us, but we are not a claimant in the South China Sea,\" Freeman said. \"We are not going to challenge China's possession of any of these land features in my judgment. If that's going to happen, it's going to be done by the Vietnamese, or ... the Filipinos ... or the Malaysians, who are the three counter-claimants of note.\" \nHe said it was an \"unfortunate, but not (an) unpredictable development.\" \nThe latest escalation over territorial claims in the contested area comes days after the US resumed \"routine\" aircraft carrier patrols in the South China Sea, a decision which China yesterday slammed as \"threatening and dangerous.\" \nFor now, the Trump administration - after vocally challenging China's geopolitical ambitions in the contested maritime areas - has not provided a diplomatic response to China's \"tests\" of its resolve.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:16:00.338+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
