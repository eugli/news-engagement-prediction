They have spread rapidly since their introduction a century ago. \nThe volunteers will be trained to monitor feeders and set up camera traps to record sightings as part of a conservation programme. \nAnd they will be asked to report greys in areas which are currently strongholds for reds. \nWorkshops are being organised by Ulster Wildlife in March to train the volunteers. \nThe data gathered will contribute to the work of Red Squirrels United, a UK-wide network set up to protect the endangered species. Image copyright Craig Shuttleworth Image caption Map showing spread of grey squirrels \nConor McKinney from Ulster Wildlife is leading the project in Northern Ireland. \nHe said numbers of red squirrels had \"declined dramatically\" since greys were introduced to Ireland in 1911. \n\"To ensure that future generations can continue to enjoy these special animals, we need volunteers to help us monitor squirrels in their local area, so we can target our conservation efforts,\" he said. \nReds are currently found in the Mournes, south and west Tyrone, parts of County Londonderry, the Glens of Antrim and Fermanagh. \nExperts believe there are only about 140,000 red squirrels left in the UK. \nThe project is being supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:43:23.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
