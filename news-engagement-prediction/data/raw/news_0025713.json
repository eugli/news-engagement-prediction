LOS ANGELES, CA – FEBRUARY 12: Singer Beyonce, winner of Best Urban Contemporary Album for ‘Lemonade’ and Best Music Video for ‘Formation,’ poses in the press room during The 59th GRAMMY Awards at STAPLES Center on February 12, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. /Getty Images/AFP \nBeyonce chose not to play it safe, instead putting on an extravagant and abstract performance with touches of Indian spirituality and ancient Egypt. \nBeyonce was introduced by her proud mother before an image of the 35-year-old singer, her baby bump openly visible under her bra, flashed on the screen. She was also shown with her mother and daughter Blue Ivy, all in gold. \nThe real Beyonce then appeared wearing a golden crown and flowing cape alongside dozens of female dancers, who made formations around her as they turned the stage into a sea of flowers. \nBeyonce sang two songs from her latest album, “Love Drought” and “Sandcastles,” interspersed with spoken word incantations on women and their power. \n“If we are going to heal, let it be glorious,” Beyonce said. \nShe ended the performance with a glance down to her husband, rap mogul Jay Z, and Blue Ivy, both of them beaming. \nThe performance was in keeping with the new, edgier persona of Beyonce, who has geared her music away from the more mainstream audience of her pop hits. \nShe is nominated for nine Grammys including in the most prestigious category of Album of the Year for “Lemonade.” adekunle ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T19:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T14:09:31.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
