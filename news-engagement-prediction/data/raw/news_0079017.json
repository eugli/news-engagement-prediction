The fees are due to be abolished entirely in June.\nVittorio Colao, the chief executive of Vodafone S ince the EU referendum, anti-Brexit politicians have raised fears that Britons face a return of heavy charges when travelling.\nA committee of MEPs said this month that the EU’s roaming rules will “no longer apply with respect to the UK, impacting business and other travellers to and from the UK” and that “transitional arrangements will be necessary”. Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, claimed mobile bills would be an example of Brexit “hitting consumers in the pocket”.\nMr Colao, one of the most senior figures in the global telecoms industry, said it was unlikely European operators would seek to renegotiate reciprocal terms for providing services to British travellers. Commercial concerns rather than regulatory changes or trade negotiations are likely to determine how mobile operators serve visitors to their networks.\nMr Colao said: “It depends on where market dynamics go, but I don’t think it is very logical to think that [charges will increase]. We have been including roaming in price packages even before the regulations so why would that change?\n“I think in the end the UK will be part of the system. Essentially, telecom rules and regulations in the UK are aligned to the European ones so the same rules will probably determine the same treatment.”\nEU telecoms regulations are due to be transposed into UK law as part of the forthcoming Great Repeal Bill. Ofcom, Britain’s telecoms industry regulator, has said it wants to ensure British consumers are protected from unfair mobile charges in subsequent trade negotiations.\nSharon White, its chief executive, said in December: “Roaming charges are being reduced for mobile phone users across the EU.\n“Progress of this kind must be reflected in agreements between the UK and member states. Otherwise our mobile operators may be exposed to unfair costs, and our people and businesses could end up paying more than our European neighbours.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:18:40.550+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
