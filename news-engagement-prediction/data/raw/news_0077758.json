An autopsy was held Saturday and the deceased has been identified, but police said they were unable to release any details about the victim because they are obliged to protect the charged youth’s identity under the Youth Criminal Justice Act. \nPolice initially responded to a call for a disturbance at the youth facility, located at 725 Quaker Rd in Oakwood, at 4:30 p.m. on Friday. When they arrived, they found the building on fire and called in assistance from the local fire department and paramedics.\nTwo other individuals were also injured in the fire, according to police. There was no update on their condition Saturday.\nThe facility is run by Connor Homes, which operates multiple foster-care homes and other facilities for mental-health services across Ontario. \n  Andy Latham, mayor of Kawartha Lakes, thanked the emergency services for their efforts in a statement.\n“I am deeply saddened by the tragic fire that has taken place,” Latham said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the loved ones of those involved. I’m proud, as always, of the Kawartha Lakes Fire and Paramedic Services and the OPP for their valiant efforts tonight.”\nThe youth charged with second-degree murder is in police custody.\nWith files from the Canadian Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T05:54:22.785+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
