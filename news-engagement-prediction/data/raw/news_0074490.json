Last week, Muslim activists along with the Jewish governor of Missouri, Eric Greitens, were among those to volunteer to help repair the St. Louis-area Jewish cemetery where at least 170 gravestones were toppled.Activists Linda Sarsour and Tarek El-Messid launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise $20,000 for repairs for the cemetery with any remaining funds going toward fixed for other vandalized Jewish centers.
