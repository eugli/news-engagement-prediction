Article continues below Jeff Stelling predicts the PL's top four and who will be relegated this season \nJoe Hart was axed in pre-season after Guardiola showed a lack of confidence in the England shot-stopper's confidence of playing out from the back with his feet, and Stones has similarly appeared to struggle with the pressure's of City's new style of play. Ferdinand envies Stones \nHowever, despite the highly-rated young defender perhaps making a slower impact at the Etihad than he would have liked, Ferdinand admits he is jealous of Stones being able to work with Guardiola and believes the England international needs the likes of Vincent Kompany to assist him. \n“It’s about different styles and Stones has clearly been asked to go out there and take risks,\" said Ferdinand, per The Sun. \n“I have to say I admire that. I’d like to have played under Guardiola because I would have enjoyed going out there and taking the ball. But it’s about balance and getting that right. \n“What the manager is asking particular players to do is the difference - and that’s why Stones needs a Vincent Kompany next to him. Requiring experience \n\"He needs some other experienced players who have played this way to help him because he’s still a young player coming into a new team.\" \nKompany's injury struggles this season have left Stones mainly partnering Nicolas Otamendi in central defence this campaign, but the Belgian is seen as the young Englishman's best mentor. \nHowever, if there is ever a better time to prove your worth, then the former Everton defender has the chance to show why City spent big on him in the summer against AS Monaco in the first leg of their last-16 Champions League tie on Tuesday. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
