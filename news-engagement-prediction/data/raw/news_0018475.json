Wow, from which tafsir (book which explains the meaning of the Quran) did they learn this from?” asked Idris in a statement published on PAS mouthpiece Harakahdaily today. \n\"Based on this interpretation, would thousands of civil servants at the Prime Minister’s Department burn in hell, too? \n“It’s the same with those who have relatives who are in Umno, would they, too, burn in hell?” \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
