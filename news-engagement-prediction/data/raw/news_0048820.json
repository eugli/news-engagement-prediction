Today it's the search. \n\"This focus on work and family support is getting me through the dark days.\" \nThe mystery of missing Corrie Mckeague Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption Makeyan Mckeague travelled down from Dunfermline to take part in the search for his missing airman brother \nMr Mckeague, from Dumferline in Fife, was last seen walking into a bin loading bay known as the \"horseshoe\" at 03:25 GMT. \nHis mobile phone was tracked moving 12 miles (19km) away to Barton Mills after he was last seen. \nIt followed the same route as a bin lorry, which had made a collection in the area the morning the airman, based at RAF Honington, disappeared. \nThe vehicle was searched but nothing found. A landfill near Milton is set to be searched by Suffolk Police. Image caption Nicola Urquhart said her son could have ended up in a bin lorry \nHis mother, Nicola Urquhart, said: \"He was not seen coming out of that street on foot. Two vehicles left between 01:00 and 06:00 on the morning he disappeared. \n\"It's logical that by misadventure or some other reason he's ended up in a bin lorry. \n\"The police are going to search the landfill site once it is made safe for the officers taking part. \n\"I don't know how long that is going to take.\" \nAndy King, SULSAR chairman, said: \"We have presumed Corrie has suffered some harm. We have searched the areas which are accessible by vehicle. \n\"But if other information is received we are willing to widen the search,\" he said.
