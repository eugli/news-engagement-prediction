City hammer West Ham 0:47 \nKevin De Bruyne put City ahead and David Silva added the second. Gabriel Jesus, the young Brazilian selected ahead of Aguero, bagged his first Premier League goal before the break and Yaya Toure got City’s fourth after half-time City remain fifth, 10 points behind leaders Chelsea, but their first win in three league games moved them level on points with fourth placed Liverpool in the race to qualify for next season’s Champions League.

Cresswell should have reduced the deficit when Andy Carroll sent him through on goal, but the defender’s woeful miscue encapsulated West Ham’s deepening gloom. \nAny doubts City would coast to victory were erased in the 39th minute when another rapier thrust cut West Ham apart. \nSane, in sublime form, crossed to Sterling and he unselfishly teed up Jesus for a simple tap-in as West Ham’s bewildered defenders looked in vain for an offside flag. \nCity made it four in the 67th minute after Fonte, enduring a debut to forget, responded to Sterling’s incisive raid with a clear trip. \nToure converted the penalty to seal City’s biggest league win since October and send West Ham’s fans scurrying to the exits.
