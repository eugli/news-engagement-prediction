It also echoed the language of autocrats who seek to minimize dissent.\" \nTruett-McConnell University is Christ-centered and rock-solid conservative! Click here for info! \nThis is the same \"revered\" news organization that once waxed poetically about the flossing habits of President Obama and commemorated his 50th birthday with a stomach-churning essay that read like a cheap romance novel. \n\"His brow is mostly smooth, his chin firm, his neck taut,\" lusted The New York Times writer Denise Grady. \nThe fact of the matter is the Mainstream Media truly is the enemy of We The People -- they hold us in contempt - treating us like we're a bunch of backwater bigots. I illustrate that point extensively in my new book, \"The Deplorables' Guide to Making America Great Again.\" \nThe folks that write our daily newspapers and broadcast the evening news are of the same mindset as Hillary Clinton and President Obama. They believe weâ€™re just a great big basket of irredeemable, gun-toting, Bible-clinging, bitter Deplorables. \nBut as much as they hate those of us who cherish traditional American values - they absolutely loathe President Trump. \nI doubt you'll see The New York Times swooning over Mr. Trump's golden mane or his flossing habits. \nThe fourth estate is indeed the Opposition Party -- and I believe they are complicit in spreading disinformation and propaganda to destabilize the Trump presidency. \nTo be honest, though, I have a problem with the term \"fake news\". I believe we ought to call it what it really is -- lying. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T19:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T01:13:31.428+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
