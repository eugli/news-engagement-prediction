Editorial Board \nA monster blizzard decked the East Coast a couple of weeks ago. California has been drenched by rainstorms in the past few days. \nMeanwhile, here in the heartland of America, here in what's typically a tundra with dramatically miserable winter weather, here in Chiberia by the Lake — nothing. No major snow to enjoy or complain about for a solid six weeks in the alleged dead of winter. \nLess than an inch since Dec. 19. \nCold? Not much compared to the brutal subzero 2013-14 polar vortex. \nWednesday could be the warmest February day in Chicago history since record-keeping began in 1871. \nWe choose our next words carefully: \nBack in the exceptionally mild January of 2002, we abandoned caution and demanded \"a real Chicago winter, spiked with a brutal blizzard, an extended spell of subzero temperatures, the symphonic howl of winds off the lake.\" \nThen a blast of subzero temps swept in with a storm that dumped as much as 12 inches of snow. Sorry about that. \nIn 2015, in a similarly misguided moment, we gloated over — er, commiserated with — New Yorkers and Bostonians ravaged by a raging winter snowstorm while we waltzed through an uncharacteristically balmy spell. Days later, a megastorm buried Chicago with 19.3 inches of snow at O'Hare International Airport. Sorry about that, too. \nWe all know some Winter-Lovers who are glumly trudging through the non-icy streets; not hurdling over slush piles; not shoveling out parking spaces and reserving them with broken-down chairs; not trembling at weather reports warning of another Snowmageddon; not extolling the joys of cross-country skiing in the forest preserves; not marveling at how a blizzard creates a still-life portrait of the city in midstride, with buses, trains and the \"L\" all groaning under the stress of more passengers and the kind of dangerous weather that freezes switches, slicks roads and makes transportation as miserable as it is vital; not sharing the citywide camaraderie that winter thrusts on us (\"Stay warm!\"\"Drive safe!\"\"Cold enough for you?\"\"Don't shovel the roof!\"); not hearing retailers merrily ringing cash registers with sales of snow shovels, ice scrapers, portable generators, subzero parkas and other polar accouterments. \nYes, we all know those people. \nInstead, a city renowned for its weather warriors (and yes, a few wimps) peeks out befuddled from its defensive winter crouch, and relaxes, and sets its shoulders against a piercing wind that never comes and murmurs, \"That's it? That's winter 2016? A chilly December and now this?\" \nNo. From sorry experience (see above) we've learned to predict that which isn't evident at this very moment: That's not the end of winter 2016. Snow could be here by Friday. And although most of Chicago's blizzards have happened in December or January, two of the top 10 came in March, meteorologist Tom Skilling reports. Hence our confidence that this winter isn't done with Chicago yet. \nFor the moment, though, we celebrate \"The Winter That Wasn't,\" a reprieve from mittens, parkas and galoshes. \nBut we also counsel vigilance. Winter in Chicago is sneaky and merciless. A polar haymaker can gather quickly in the Great Plains and roar toward Lake Michigan. \nFor college freshmen and others who have recently arrived and been warned about winter here: Don't be lulled into thinking it's always San Diego-ish serene. Keep your snow shovels at the ready, your winter readiness at peak. Don't send your winter gear to the cleaners. Don't stow the boots and ask why hardware stores have bags of salt alongside the spring fertilizer. Remain on alert. \nDon't. Tempt. Winter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:50:46.112+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
