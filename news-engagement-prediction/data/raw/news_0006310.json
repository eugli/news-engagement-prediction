I did the math. ‘That’s almost 25 bikers,’ I thought, almost in a panic. \nEven if you think you suck at your sport, you don’t always have to go it alone. Photo: Courtesy of Brandon Scherzberg I could already picture them speeding up behind me as I nervously studied the steep, technical sections of the mountain bike trail. I could feel them breeze by me as I pulled off to the side to catch my breath. \nI instantly regretted not waking up earlier to beat them all to the trail. \nMy entire outdoor “career,” I’ve suffered this same sort of nervous apprehension about pushing myself in front of other people. Part of the reason I love the outdoors so much is for the sense of solitude and privacy it offers: Climb high enough or walk far enough and you’re all but guaranteed to be alone. \nThen, throw a few spectators into the mix and suddenly all my doubts about my own abilities shift into clear focus. \nWhy? I’m not sure. Maybe it was the time a grumpy mountain biker barked, “Just go!” at me when I couldn’t get off to the side of the trail fast enough to let him pass. \nOr perhaps it was when I forgot to unclip my rope from the rock wall until I was too far above it, listening to the snickers of a group of climbers watching me from the ground. Or maybe it’s that tiny ping of embarrassment I feel every time I can’t keep up with my fitter, faster, naturally athletic friends. \nBeing in a crowd can make your doubts about your abilities shift into focus, but it can also motivate you to push through them. Photo: Courtesy of Brandon Scherzberg But what would happen if I just ignored my doubts, all that internal dialogue, the snarky observations of bystanders? \nA few years ago, fed up with having to wake up before dawn just to get out before anyone else, I decided to do just that. And, weirdly, I loved it. Those big, scary mountain bikers actually turned out to be incredibly supportive and friendly, shouting, “Yeah, girl!” every time they spotted me on the trail (even if they were still barreling past me). \nThose angry-looking boulderers at the rock gym tentatively started giving me advice when they saw me struggling with a problem; there was no snickering. \nI started noticing a slew of familiar faces. \nA sense of camaraderie slowly crept in to replace the holes where embarrassment and defensiveness used to live. \nBut perhaps the most surprising outcome of deciding not to care is that I had progressed faster in one year than I had in the previous three. I was observing, learning and feeding off a group energy that just doesn’t exist when you go it alone. \nAbove all, I quickly remembered that being outdoors is about doing the things we love, and doing them for the fun of it. Not to impress, and not to judge. While being in a group can bring your doubts about your abilities to light, it can also be the motivation you need to push through them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T18:11:08.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
