The excessive PDA session took place last month and left most people confused as hell. Now on #ENews : Details inside Selena Gomez and the Weeknd's steamy vacation. Are they exclusive? pic.twitter.com/jHVvgUSE6Y \n— E! News (@enews) January 30, 2017 \nWhy were they confused? Well, the better question is what the hell is Selena Gomez doing with The Weeknd? Doesn’t she know this makes things awkward for everyone ( even Taylor Swift )?! \nWhile the exact reason behind Bella and The Weeknd’s breakup is unclear, we do know Bella was NOT happy following their sudden split back in November. \nThe 20-year-old model was photographed giving paparazzi the middle finger just days after news of The Weeknd and Selena getting together. Bella Hadid unhappy with paparazzi, flips finger days after The Weeknd and Selena Gomez… https://t.co/iwIOFz8ic3 pic.twitter.com/zFesDLZXtH \n— MySocial Radio (@mysocialradio) January 15, 2017 \nSince then, people have wondered how Gomez and Hadid really feel about each other. If there’s any way to gauge the tension, it’s by stalking their close friends. \nEnter Hailey Baldwin. \nBella Hadid’s 20-year-old BFF might’ve accidentally shed a little light on exactly how these two ladies feel about each other. Hailey Baldwin took to Twitter to share Bella’s breathtaking new bubble bath video with W Magazine. \nAlong with the video, Baldwin tweeted, \nWait sorry, WHO could possibly be cuter than Bella Hadid… literally nobody. \nHmm, I think this calls for a “SHOTS FIRED” alert. Here’s Hailey Baldwin’s tweet low-key shading Selena Gomez while bragging about Bella Hadid. Wait sorry, WHO could possibly be cuter than @bellahadid …. literally nobody. https://t.co/GqOieih2g6 \n— Hailey Baldwin (@haileybaldwin) January 31, 2017 \nSo, is she coming for Selena Gomez or not? It’s hard to tell. Luckily, there’s enough information in that tweet to make an educated guess. Not only did Baldwin lead off with “wait,” but she also apologizes just before asking a legitimate question… \n“WHO could possibly be cuter than Bella Hadid?!” \nThat to me sounds like Hailey Baldwin was in the middle of a heated conversation about Bella Hadid and ~someone else~. Of course, she took the side of her BFF because that’s what BFFs do. \nThanks to an information poll on Perez Hilton, it appears a whopping 49 percent of people believe Baldwin was indeed referring to Selena Gomez in her tweet. \nAnother 37 percent think she might’ve been talking about Gomez, but could also have just been complimenting Bella. Lastly, 14 percent of voters believe Hailey isn’t “petty” enough to throw shade like that. \nHey, 49 percent — that’s telling! Numbers don’t lie… \nAs for what Bella Hadid’s been up to these days (besides ducking the paparazzi)? She was last seen trying to make the world a better place by protesting against President Donald Trump’s controversial immigration ban .
