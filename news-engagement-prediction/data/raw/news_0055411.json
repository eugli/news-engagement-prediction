(Source: PTI) \nAs the politically crucial Uttar Pradesh is all set to witness its fourth phase of Assembly elections, tight security arrangements are being made in 53 constituencies spread across 12 districts where the voting will take place on February 23. Districts going to polls in the fourth phase are Pratapgarh, Kaushambi, Allahabad, Mahoba, Banda, Hamirpur, Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Chitrakoot and Fatehpur. All major parties including Samajwadi Party (SP), Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ), Congress and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have put high stakes with an intention to form government with full majority. As the state has seen some high decibel rallies and roadshows, PM Narendra Modi , UP CM Akhilesh Yadav and BSP supremo Mayawati has been among the host of leaders who have kept the balls rolling for their respective parties. The ongoing polls are touted to be a litmus test for the SP government as the party has recently came out from a family feud. PM Modi-led BJP stands tall as one of the strongest competitors for the ruling party. On one hand, where Akhilesh has managed to build an image of ‘leader for youth’ and have gained a huge vote bank in various regions of the state, some blame him for the law-and-order failure in the state. \nBJP’s star campaigner, PM Modi, during his surged campaigning spree has constantly targeted the SP-Congress alliance and the BSP for corruption in their regime. \nMaking it a crucial three-way contest, Mayawati-led BSP has cemented itself as one of lead contenders in this political run. However, the party is still behind in terms of vote bank apart from some particular communities. Even the votes of Muslim community have gone to her in limited areas where the candidates fielded are very strong. The high-octane assembly elections are in full swing in India’s most populous state and is expected to lay the cornerstone for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. While SP aims at retaining its power, this time with the Congress, both BJP and BSP are fighting to make a comeback. \nBalrampur is constituency No. 294 of Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly.
