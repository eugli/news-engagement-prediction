During a game against the Clippers, an ugly fracas between beloved former Knick great Charles Oakley and Madison Square Garden security ended with Oakley being cuffed and escorted from the arena. Oakley was charged with three counts of assault and criminal trespass before he was released from a midtown precinct later that night. \nWhat happened? Well, Charles Oakley and Knicks owner James Dolan have a storied history of reciprocal dislike, reportedly stemming from the public comments Oakley has made disapproving of the job Dolan has done as owner, and from the seeming lack of respect Dolan has shown Oakley as a Knick legend. As such, Dolan has asked MSG security to inform him any time Oakley is in the arena. So, after he took his seat on Wednesday, about four rows behind the owner, security approached him. It is unclear whether Oakley had been heckling Dolan or not: Oakley claims he didn't know Dolan was even there until guards showed up; security claims he was being abusive. But what is clear is what happened next: a shoving and pushing match between Oakley and a slew of MSG security, who then forcefully escorted him from the building. The New York Knicks fanbase, and the larger NBA community, were outraged, with almost everyone taking the side of the beloved Charles Oakley. \nAnd yet today James Dolan has somehow managed to handle the situation in a way that might seem counterintuitive to most, but which is so perfectly Knicks: he made it worse. Today, he fired his security chief . Perhaps he felt he did wrong and was ready to make up with Oak? Nope. Michael Kay has invited James Dolan onto his radio show today and is reporting that \"Charles Oakley will never be allowed to enter MSG again, even if he purchases a ticket.\" \nDolan has already walked that back. \nhttps://twitter.com/TimBontemps/status/830160065432780801 \nIn a still-developing conflict, it might be rash to rush to judgment on who's wrong and who's right here (though if Oakley really is in need of \"help,\" which the team suggested in its statement, it might behoove a former family to offer some instead of casting him out). But there is this: after a very successful run of basketball in the 1990s—in which they went to the playoffs in every season and made the NBA Finals twice—the Knicks have been mostly terrible during James Dolan's tenure. With this Oakley clusterfuck, the Knicks have not only just further infuriated an already fed up fanbase (the MSG crowd was chanting \"Free Oakley\" last night at a Rangers' game ), but they've sent a loud and clear message to any potential free agents (one Melo is learning well): we'll welcome you with open arms. Right up until we don't.
