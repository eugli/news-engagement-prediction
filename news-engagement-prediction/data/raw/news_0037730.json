A religion of moderation. A religion for humanity. I am a proud Muslim. I am a proud Muslim due to the underlying principles of Islam which I believe are in line with universal values of humanity. Humanity which encompasses all religions, races and ideological beliefs. I will hold on to that belief until the day I die. \nI have been told not to speak on this issue as it is “unpopular” and“unstrategic”. \nAt times, when a nation is at a crossroads, being unstrategic and unpopular is necessary to preserve the moral fabric of our beloved nation. \nMy fellow Malaysians, \nI beg you to think of this newly proposed amendment critically and fairly. Put the labellings aside and think of our beloved nation. \nWhere is the justice when a serial rapist is seen to be less of a criminal than an innocent Malay-Muslim who consensually engages in khalwat or drinking alcohol? \nSelva Kumar Subbiah served 24 years in prison for raping and sexually abusing countless of women. A Muslim caught committing khalwat/drinking alcohol may be imprisoned up to 30 years/caned 100 times/fined RM100,000. Is rape less of a serious offence than a moral mistake? It’s concerning that a victimless moral mistake is punished heavier than those who steal, rape and take bribery. \nWhere is the justice when the vast majority of the Muslim elite can escape punishment but the lowest rungs of society get punished? \nKhalwat raids primarily take place at 1 or 2 star hotels, never at Hilton or Sheraton. Those who drink alcohol in the comfort of their bungalows will be shielded from prosecution while those who get caught sneaking a sip at a bar will be prosecuted. Those who are well-connected can escape the religious raids while those less connected will lose their livelihoods. Where is the justice? \nWhere is the justice when young and innocent Malay-Muslims will be the primary victims of the disproportionate punishment of this law? \nYoung people are bound to make mistakes in life. An increase in punishment won’t deter them from committing a moral offence. Act 355 has been amended three times since 1964, yet we don’t see a decrease in offence, but an increase. With the punishment reaching 30 years imprisonment/100,000 fine/being caned 100 times, a mistake committed when one was young could potentially cripple the future of this Malay-Muslim forever. \nI don’t like racialising the victims of this law but the reality is that the vast majority of current moral offenders are Malay-Muslims. \nFor the rest of this story and more, subscribe for only RM150 a year.
