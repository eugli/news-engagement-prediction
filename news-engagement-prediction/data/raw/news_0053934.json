But doing it barely 24 hours after its official launch is something else. Such is the case with AMD’s recently announced Ryzen 7 1800X, which apparently has broken the world record for Cinebench R15. \nIt has to noted, however, in order to break the Cinebench R15 record score, the overclockers had to cool the Ryzen 7 1800X processor using liquid nitrogen (LN2) along with a insane bump in voltage of around 1.875V. As a result, the fairly new CPU was able to churn out clock speeds of 5.2GHz on all eight cores, all while being cooled to a bone chilling temperature of -200°C. Image: TweakTown \nThe previous Cinebench R15 world record, which most likely was achieved using an ‘extreme series’ Intel processor, was 2,410. AMD’s Ryzen 7 1800X surpassed this with a score 2,449. The difference in score may be somewhat slim, but let’s not forget that the Ryzen 7 1800X does come at a relatively low price compared to Intel’s powerhouse CPUs. \nSpeaking of prices, for those who are not aware, the Ryzen R7 1800X has an MSRP of RM2,599, which is a fair price when one considers what the processor is capable of doing. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see how Intel’s upcoming Kaby Lake X processors will be able to compete with AMD’s newest flagship CPU.
