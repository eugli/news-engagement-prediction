We understand from them that it probably could be 45 or so classrooms,” PCL Construction district manager Aaron Yohnke said Sunday. \n“If it was ceiling tile and grid, you’re probably in around four dollars a square foot. It’s probably $50,000 to $75,000 worth of material.” \nPCL and Morguard also previously donated ceiling tile from the Target location at Lawson Heights Mall to Habitat for Humanity. \n“If you get creative, quite often, you can really divert a lot of materials from landfills,” Yohnke said. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
