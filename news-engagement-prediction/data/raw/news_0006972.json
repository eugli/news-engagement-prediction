Photo: Supplied \n“I found it very relaxing to have that change of scenery from droughts and floods – a break from the vagaries of rural farm life,” he says. \n“When I bought the property I had a vision of creating a sanctuary; my own oasis in the city.” \nTo say Mr Stewart was successful is an understatement. While the house was appealing when he bought it in 2008, it was dated and claustrophobic, decked out in heritage colours and heavy on the dark timber. \nThe home underwent an extensive makeover after he purchased it in 2008. Photo: Supplied \nMr Stewart removed a number of walls, opening the house up to the natural light, increasing the space and giving it a better sense of flow. \nHe also committed timber treason in the process. \n“I took out all the red cedar doors and had them painted white, which some people thought was sacrilege,” he laughs. “But I basically removed the heaviness of the dark timber and the red features that dominated the home. I wanted a contemporary classical feel, something which could give me that feeling of being in a sanctuary.” \nLarge slabs of marble top crisp Wyer & Craw cabinetry.

Currently a director at Austsafe, a super fund for rural and regional communities, he has his sights set on a new challenge: renovating an acreage property. \nAn inner city oasis.

Now that I’ve sold the farm and moving on in my career, I’m ready for something different and another challenge.” \nClaydon House will be auctioned onsite on February 18 at 10am. \n‘Claydon House’ 10 York Parade, Spring Hill.
