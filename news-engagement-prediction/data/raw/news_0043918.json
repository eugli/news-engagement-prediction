SIMON SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ \nOne of the places Watercare might build a water treatment plant is across the road from the Robinsons. Family members, from left: Mya Robinson, 8, Ian Robinson, and Jaime Ireland, 11. \n\"It's fair to say that we as is the wider community are in shock, we are surprised and quite frankly devastated that a water treatment plant may be built in Oratia.\" \nGoldsmith's house is one of those that could be taken for the plant, and the land has been in his family for more than a century. \nHe said Save Oratia recognises the city needs clean water but Watercare has other alternatives, instead of \"tearing a community apart\". SIMON SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ \nSave Oratia chairman Paul Goldsmith on his land where Watercare might build a water treatment plant. \n\"I'm not overstating this, but this will rip the heart out of Oratia,\" he said. \n\"It doesn't have to be this way, and that is the reason we want to work with the Watercare board to prioritise solutions that don't involve decimating a community.\" \nThe first people in Oratia knew of Watercare's plans was a leaflet put in letterboxes two weeks ago. SIMON SMITH/FAIRFAX NZ \nOratia Ratepayers and Residents Association secretary Penny Sparks and president Dave Smith. \nWatercare is now considering four possible sites for a new water treatment plant that would cost up to $400 million – depending on the location. \nTwo of the sites are next to each other on Parker Rd in Oratia, another option is to rebuild its 90-year-old plant in Titirangi and a fourth option is build adjacent to its existing site – in native bush. \nAll are within an area covered by the Waitakere Ranges Heritage Area Act. \nA Watercare strategy document dated December 2016 had community consultation and information events in February and site selection in March. \nBut Watercare spokesperson Maxine Clayton said there is no time frame yet for a decision on which site will be built, nor on the look or design of the plant. \n\"Community consultation is a major part of the process,\" she said. \n\"Once feedback is received, this information will then help us to form a final decision.\" \nA Tonkin & Taylor engineering report for Watercare in June 2016 ranked Parker Rd as its top site \"on the basis of engineering, cultural, environmental, social and consenting risk criteria\". \nWatercare is holding public meetings or information nights in the area on February 21, 22 and March 1. \nREAD MORE: * Auckland water treatment plant to be replaced; three options given \nGraeme Gash's family has owned a property where the plant might be built for six generations. \n\"My great grandparents came out in 1905. They lived in a tin shed and a tent,\" he said. \n\"I have deep roots. I wasn't intending to go anywhere.\" \nGash said he is hopeful there can be a dialogue with Watercare, but the community has been traumatised. \n\"I'm not going to tear them apart, but it would be an understatement to say I am disappointed in how it's been handled.\" \nThe Robinson family live directly across the road from where the plant might be built and are horrified at the prospect. \n\"We are the worst of the worst in that we get no compensation - but we get our property value decimated. And we have two years of living next door to a construction site,\" Tracey Robinson said. \nRobinson said she and her husband worked hard for 20 years to acquire their house. They purchased it four years ago and have renovated it. \nThey would lose all the equity in their house, she said. \n\"If they use the Public Works Act and acquire those properties it would appear we have no recourse,\" she said. \n\"Our children are absolutely gutted. Their friends might lose their houses.\" \nOratia Residents and Ratepayers Association president Dave Smith said the association meets with council every month to be involved with significant issues affecting its members, but the first it heard of Watercare's plans was this month. \nThe association is \"shocked and surprised\" and supports Save Oratia. \n\"There is clearly a problem with Watercares' 'consultation' process to date, and we are keen to help get them back on track,\" he said. \n\"We will be asking to go right back to the drawing board on consultation and will want our community to have fair involvement and input into the process.\" \nThe Parker Rd site should have been discounted due to its social impact, Smith said. \n\"To suggest that over a dozen families should lose their homes for the construction of the plant is outrageous.\" \nWatercare purchased 7.7 hectares of land at 130 Parker Rd, Oratia, on November 7, 2016, for $2,850,000. \nIts rateable value, as of July 2014, was $1,300,000. \n* Go to saveoratia.org.nz and watercare.co.nz for more. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T11:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:32:58.163+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
