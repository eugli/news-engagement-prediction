Speaking to FOX Latin America via Goal, he said; \n\"I know Pep has always had a lot of respect for Wilshere - he impressed so many of the Barcelona team when we played Arsenal in 2011 .\" \n\"He impressed me a lot that night, I know he also did Pep and it will be a player that he would have been following ever since. \" \nXavi is referring to the Champions League encounter where Wilshere starred in the middle of the park, and it's a performance which still sticks out; \"We have talked about him, it was not a performance you forget easily. \" \n\"Technically he is the sort of player that Pep loves - his only problem has been injuries - and if it wasn't for the issues he has had with injuries I am sure he would be one of the best midfield players in the world. \" \n\"At the moment he seems to be doing well with his fitness - and if there is a chance to sign him in the summer - I am sure Pep will give it real consideration.\" \nWhat do you reckon; Wilshere to City in the summer?
