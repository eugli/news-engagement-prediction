Campaign groups have long demanded action over the increasing noise, smell, and pollution from cruise ships, with many saying the environmental and aesthetic costs of the thriving industry outweigh the benefits to the local economy. Previous studies have shown cruise ships are belching out almost one billion tons of carbon dioxide every year, in addition to smoke and heavy metals emitted by the combustion of marine diesel and oil. Pollution levels on the sun deck and jogging lane were found to have the highest concentration of pollutants during one, 50-minute reading. Pictured above, a file photo of the sun deck of the Silver Wind cruise ship Mr Rieger warned the poor air quality could be rife across nearly all cruise ships because of the widespread use of low quality fuels, such as heavy fuel oil, combined with a lack of particulate filters. But Helge Grammerstorf, the German national director of the Cruise Lines International Association dismissed the readings as unsubstantiated. The former ship captain and ship broker said a more systematic test over a longer period would be needed. ‘We don’t know these measurements. The claim is completely unsubstantiated,’ he told German daily newspaper Hamburger Abendblatt. Environmentalists have called for stricter regulations to make cruise companies switch to more environmentally friendly fuels, such as road diesel or liquid natural gas and to make particulate filters and nitrogen catalysts mandatory. Last year, California based Princess Cruise Lines were fined a record £32million after pleading guilty to dumping thousands of gallons of oil and waste off the cost of the UK.
