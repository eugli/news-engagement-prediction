Advertisement \n\"Robust relationships can be established when both countries have mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity, non-interference into the domestic affairs of each other, and the ability to develop a mutually beneficial partnership\" Mr Widodo said. \nBoth leaders cited the Lombok Treaty signed between Australia and Indonesia in 2006 as the \"bedrock\" of their security and defence relationship. The treaty binds the parties to disallow activities that could threaten the stability of the other. \nThere was agitation in Jakarta earlier this year when a protester in Melbourne managed to climb onto the roof of the Indonesia consulate and unfurl the Free Papua Movement (OPM) flag. \nThe suspension of some defence co-operation programs in early January was tied to training materials - reportedly including posters on West Papua - deemed offensive by Indonesian officers who were in Perth on a training course. \nIn their Sunday statement the two leaders talked up the need for greater investment and business ties and close cooperation on cyber security, people smuggling, transnational crime and terrorism, especially with the threat of foreign fighters returning from Syria and Iraq. \nThe pair also committed to achieving a bilateral economic agreement by the end of the year, with Indonesia already agreeing to lower tariffs on Australian sugar and to accept more cattle in return for concessions on imported Indonesian pesticides and fertilisers. \nMr Widodo dined at the Lucy and Malcolm Turnbull's private residence on Saturday night and the pair took a stroll through the Botanic Gardens on Sunday morning prior to a formal lunch and ceremonial welcome. \nOn Sunday afternoon Mr Widodo wound up his flying visit by taking to the stage at an Indonesian community event at Darling Harbour, where he received a rousing welcome from more than 2000 people.
