The St. Charles, Mo., native spent 10 seasons with the Dynamo before being traded to Sporting Kansas City last year so he could play closer to his family. He retired after the Dynamo rival was eliminated in the playoffs. \nKnown most for his magical left foot, Davis recorded double-digit assists in seven of his 10 seasons with Houston. His 120 assists in all competitions are most in Dynamo history by 90. He ranks third all-time in MLS history with 122 regular season assists. \nA six-time all-star and two-time MLS Cup champion, Davis also is the Dynamo's career leader in all competitions in games played (328), games started (302), minutes played (25,985). He is third in goals (45). \nDavis had 17 caps with the U.S. Men's National Team and was on the 2014 FIFA World Cup team. He started one group stage game against Germany. \nIn addition to the one-day contract, the Dynamo will hold a charitable initiative in Davis' honor around a home game this season. Details are still to be determined.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:08:16.321+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
