So Huawei has something for those that want a smaller smartphone than the P10 Plus or the Mate 9. The Huawei P10 is a pretty high-end flagship device, but they also have a 3200mAh battery inside, which given the size of this smartphone, is actually a fairly large battery and should last you all day long with the P10. Not to mention the fact that Huawei has been known for producing smartphones with pretty incredible battery life. \nNow this isn’t new with the P10, but Huawei is using machine learning to help users get the most out of their battery life. The device will automatically go into a deep sleep if you haven’t used it for quite a while. It’ll also turn off some settings you don’t need, and will even keep applications from waking up the device and using more resources than it needs. It’ll manage the CPU and RAM to keep things running optimal when the device isn’t being used. This is great as it allows you to get even more out of your battery when it’s just sitting on the table or whatnot. \nHuawei’s battery will also charge up pretty quickly. The P10 does not use a Qualcomm chipset which means that the device won’t be using their Quick Charge functionality, but they do have their own fast charging functionality. Which is going to allow you to charge up your Huawei P10 in near record time. Unfortunately it won’t be compatible with your existing fast charging products like battery packs, chargers, etc., and you’ll need to stick with the charger that comes in the box with the Huawei P10, so you’ll want to keep that in mind. \nThe Huawei P10 and P10 Plus sport different sized batteries, but have the same features. Of course, the P10 Plus battery is going to take a bit longer to charge up, seeing as it is a bit larger than the P10’s. But it should also last a bit longer, despite powering a larger display. Huawei has built the Kirin 960 to be a pretty powerful processor, but also pretty efficient when it comes to the battery.
