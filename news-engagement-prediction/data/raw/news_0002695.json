(Photo: David Butler II, USA TODAY Sports) \nRex Ryan has some (totally unsolicited) advice for the Falcons: Get Tom Brady cranky. \nNot sure the Falcons want advice on beating Tom Brady from a guy who went 4-12 against Tom Brady, but here it is, from Ryan's fun interview with New York Daily News : \n\"I used to put a lot of stuff out there knowing it would piss off Brady,\" Ryan told the Daily News this week. \nRyan once waxed poetic about Peyton Manning in an effort to tick off Brady: \"(Manning) is tremendous,\" Ryan said in 2011. \"There is no one else like this guy in the league. Nobody studies like him. I know Brady thinks he does. I think there's probably a little more help from Belichick with Brady than there is with Peyton Manning.\" \nOf course, that quote in particular did provide the desired results: The Jets stunned the Patriots in the playoffs - this was that time Mark Sanchez led a team to the AFC championship game . \nBrady threw for 29 touchdowns and seven interceptions against Ryan's usually staunch defenses. He also won 10 of their last 11 matchups. Heck, even Ryan knows who the G.O.A.T. is. \n\"I could see where Brady definitely would be considered the greatest ever if he won five Super Bowls,\" Ryan told the Daily News. \"How could you argue that?\" Ryan also talked about his own interview for the Falcons job and his future plans in the interview.
