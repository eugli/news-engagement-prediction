As well as being fit, strong and healthy,\" Ms Miller said on Facebook. \n\"Legendary effort from a legendary man.\" \nRescuers have remarked at his \"will to live\". External Link: Dan Miller after his rescue \nSteve Howard from Fire and Rescue New South Wales said Mr Miller had to bend his back in an awkward way just to keep his head up. \n\"All that was out of the water was his forehead and his nose bent back, trying to face the sky, that's what we saw when we arrived,\" Mr Howard said. \n\"It's bad enough to be under an excavator but it's worse when it's in water. \n\"When it's just your nose sticking out of the water for hours it's quite remarkable how he could keep himself up that way. \n\"It's like doing a two-and-and-a-half-hour push-up.\" \nMs Miller said her husband had the weight of the excavator on his back and the boggy dam ground below him was slowly slipping away while he hoped for a rescue. \nFreeing him was a delicate operation, Mr Howard said. \n\"We had two choices, we had to either lift it or dig and lifting wasn't an option because there was no solid base to push off so we decided we'd dig,\" he said. \n\"So other firefighters and myself just used our bare hands to dig under his body so we could lower him down and then bring him down under the roll bar.\" \nMr Howard said it was lucky a passerby heard Mr Miller's cries for help. \n\"Someone has just heard him yelling out through the trees, it's like a rural property with not much around â€¦ so he could've been there for a lot longer,\" he said. \nMr Miller was eventually freed and taken to the John Hunter Hospital, where he is recovering in a stable condition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:52:45.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
