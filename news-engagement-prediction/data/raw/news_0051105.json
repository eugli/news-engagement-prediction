[The agent] opened my passport and saw Lindsay Lohan and started apologizing but said, 'Take off your headscarf.'\" \nWeird! \nShe continued: \n\"I mean, it's OK. But what scared me was that moment, how would another woman who doesn't feel comfortable taking off her headscarf feel? That was really interesting to me. I was kind of in shock. It was strange… I'm from New York, born and raised. I was a little intimidated.\" \nThe point she makes about how another woman, or a Muslim woman, would feel taking off her headscarf is actually a good one. \nLindsay was reportedly returning from Turkey at the time of the incident and said she wore a headscarf as a sign of \"personal respect\" towards the country. \nThe Mean Girls star has admitted in the past that she is studying Turkish and Arabic in order to better communicate with people. \nHowever, during the interview she denied rumors that she was converting to Islam, saying: \n\"I think that me studying the Quran is something I found solace in. You can't just convert to a religion overnight. I just study it, nothing is confirmed yet. Religion is a personal belief, my sister's [Ali Lohan] a Buddhist. I don't want to speak on something I haven't finished yet. I find a solace in studying not just the Quran but meditation. The Islamic culture, I feel it's a family to me, they've been really good people to me. I want to learn the language so I can discuss situations with them. It calms me. It's something I'm interested in.\" \nWell, we wish her the best. She seems more grounded lately than she has in a long time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:53:30.616+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
