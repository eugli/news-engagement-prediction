This measure, it must be stressed, is not aimed at any particular race or religious group. It is designed only to lessen the terrorist risk to the U.S. Which is why it is outrageous that many figures on the Left — from Labour's Dennis Skinner to the Guardian newspaper and its more idiotic contributors — have rushed to compare Mr Trump to Adolf Hitler. This is not only a grotesque insult to him and the people of democratic, freedom-loving, constitutional America, but to the six million murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. The Mail would remind the Left that the new President has yet to cause any suffering beyond disruption to air travel — unlike their former hero, Tony Blair, who left much of the Middle East drenched in blood. Which brings us to that quintessential member of the liberal elite, the former Foreign Office mandarin Lord Ricketts. This is a man whose Foreign Office was deeply implicated in the catastrophes of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria, which gave birth to Islamic State. Yet now he has the gall to lecture Theresa May on her relationship with Mr Trump. By inviting the President to a state visit, he says, she has put the Queen in a 'very difficult position'. Leave aside that Lord Ricketts, who conducted a defence review for David Cameron, now just happens to be a paid consultant to Lockheed Martin, the U.S. aircraft firm which Mr Trump hit on Monday when he knocked $600 million off a government contract for F-35 fighters. In 2011, Barack Obama (pictured) all but stopped admitting Iraqi refugees for six months, while drastically tightening procedures for vetting Forget that, needless to say, he is a prominent Remoaner, who was ennobled by Mr Cameron after serving in the vanguard of Project Fear as our ambassador to Paris. Why on Earth does he think the Queen might be embarrassed to welcome the democratically elected representative of our closest ally? Heaven knows, under pressure from the Foreign Office that Lord Ricketts once led, Her Majesty has sat in her carriage on the Mall beside far more unsavoury characters than Mr Trump. Take President Suharto of Indonesia, whose regime was blamed for up to a million deaths after the bloody invasion of East Timor in 1974. Or Emperor Hirohito of Japan, leader of Hitler's wartime ally. Indeed, only in 2015, at the behest of the Foreign Office, she wined and dined President Xi Jinping of China, whose regime holds and tortures countless political prisoners, while executing hundreds every year. Yet the Queen has survived all these visits with her dignity and reputation entirely intact. How could she possibly be harmed by extending the same courtesy to Mr Trump? Indeed, it would be far more embarrassing for her to withdraw or postpone her invitation to the President. For, in doing so, she would insult not just him but the nation he represents, which came to our rescue in two world wars and ensured the survival of the Throne. Isn't it strange that the Left spits so much bile against the champions of freedom to which refugees long to flee, while raising barely a squeak of protest against the hellholes they want to flee from? Instead of attacking Mrs May, Lord Ricketts should have been congratulating her for ensuring Mr Trump's continuing support for the Nato alliance. No, the Prime Minister must stick to her guns and insist that Mr Trump's invitation should stand. In Washington last week, she laid the groundwork for a revival of the Special Relationship, which promises huge benefits for both our countries after Brexit. In sealing her friendship with the President, she foreshadowed a dramatic shift in the balance of global trade, which will have filled our EU partners with deep concern (and it is no coincidence, surely, that the attacks on Mr Trump in this country come mainly from the Remain camp). And it's the Remain camp, of course, which seems impervious to the fact that it would be sheer madness to throw away those advantages, so recently gained, by gratuitously snubbing a President who has shown himself so anxious to promote Britain's prosperity. As for Mr Trump himself, this paper reserves judgment on his presidency, which is less than a fortnight old. Yes, we may question his executive decisions. But, so far, he has given little reason to doubt that his motive in imposing restrictions on migration from the breeding-grounds of terrorism is exactly as he says — to safeguard the American people. It may not work. But it hardly behoves our European allies, who have paid a heavy price in blood for throwing open their borders, to lecture him on how best to defeat terrorism (and how ironic that in this country, the President's opponents want to counter his ban on terrorists by imposing a ban on him). Though it may come as a surprise to Britain's elite — that tyranny of the minority — who see Mr Trump as a cartoon Satan, no President in history has regarded entry into the U.S. as a universal, unconditional human right. So the Mail's message to the hysterical Left is straightforward: calm down — and keep things in perspective. These are nervous times. The last thing Britain wants to do is make an enemy of the world's greatest power.
