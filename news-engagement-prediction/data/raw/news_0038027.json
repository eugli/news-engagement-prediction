A lot of kids are living in really hard circumstances; they might have parents who are drinking, doing drugs. They might be living with trauma day to day.\"\nPositive messages He said there's a lot of strength in Indigenous culture and its elders.\n\"We wanted to connect the two, the positive stories out there to the kids who are feeling hurt,\" said Redvers.\nHe said he wanted to create a place for Indigenous youth to \"find positive role models and positive messages for when they're feeling dark.\"\nHe hopes to post a video from each Indigenous community in the country, particularly in remote areas.\nHe said videos from community members, such as fishermen and teachers, are as impactful as high-profile people.\n\"We need to see people who we recognize adding their voices and de-stigmatizing talking about pain and healing,\" said Redvers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T00:20:27.335+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
