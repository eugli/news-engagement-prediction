Released in the wake of the hype for Final Fantasy VII, it gained a legion of fans thanks to its gorgeous visuals, stirring soundtrack and surprisingly deep and convoluted storyline, which features more twists and turns than your average M. Night Shyamalan movie. Exclusive to North America and Japan upon its original release, Final Fantasy Tactics thankfully saw a global launch on the PlayStation Portable in 2007, a lovingly remastered edition which has subsequently been ported to smartphones. Ridge Racer Type 4 © SurvivalHorror100 \nNamco's Ridge Racer series is practically synonymous with PlayStation , and the astonishingly accurate port of the arcade original is often credited as the game which \"sold\" the console to the masses. Sony's system saw sequels such as Ridge Racer Revolution and Rage Racer, but it's Ridge Racer Type 4 which arguably constitutes the zenith of the franchise on the 32-bit platform. While it lacked the depth and complexity of Gran Turismo – released at roughly the same time – Type 4 offered addictive arcade-style racing alongside some of the best visuals on the console. It even came with a souped up version of Ridge Racer on a separate disc which ran at a higher resolution than the original PlayStation release. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night © somethinglacking1's channel \nIt's ironic that one of the most pivotal moments in the long-running Castlevania series received such a frosty reception upon release from some quarters of the gaming press. Symphony of the Night was attacked by some magazines for its 2D visuals, yet behind the 16-bit style was an epic, non-linear platforming RPG which pulled in the best bits of previous Castlevania outings, as well as Nintendo's legendary Super Metroid. While Symphony of the Night sold well in Japan and North America, the PAL copy was an undeserved flop and is therefore worth a substantial amount these days. Thankfully you can play it on your PS Vita by downloading the PSN version – and save yourself a few pennies in the process. WipEout 2097 © John GodGames \nThe first WipEout was a defining game in the PlayStation's launch library, but it was the second title which really refined the concept of anti-grav racing. Everything was turned up to the next level, with better visuals, faster action and a pumping soundtrack which included the likes of Orbital, The Chemical Brothers, Leftfield and The Prodigy. The WipEout series would see more sequels but 2097 is often cited as the one hardcore fans prefer, with its mix of tight gameplay, superb track design, excellent audio and inventive weaponry all combining to produce what is arguably one of the best racers on this – and any other – console. MediEvil © ChocolateRob \nDeveloped in the UK by Sony's Cambridge studio, MediEvil was loosely billed as a spiritual successor to Capcom's Ghosts 'n Goblins series at the time of release. It was blessed with a similar aesthetic, with cartoonish characters and a game world which felt like it had come straight out of a Tim Burton movie. While it wasn't exactly shy of proclaiming its inspirations, MediEvil nevertheless delivered a polished experience and became a best-seller all over the world. A sequel followed which set the action in the Victorian era, and the original was rebooted for the launch of the PlayStation Portable, but it's the very first title which really stands out as a solid-gold classic. Jumping Flash © World of Longplays \nWhile many would cite Crash Bandicoot as Sony's answer to Mario , in actual fact the PlayStation had a worthy answer to the Italian plumber at launch – and what's even more surprising is that the title in question actually did the whole \"3D platforming\" thing before Mario 64 turned up. Jumping Flash is something of a forgotten gem these days, despite its incredible significance; it was one of the first platformers to give the player three dimensions to work with. The unique first-person perspective was initially challenging, but with each powerful leap the camera would automatically face downwards, giving you the chance to plan your landing. It's remarkable that more fuss wasn't made of Jumping Flash at the time; there's no denying that it's a short and rather repetitive experience, but one that is nevertheless well worth partaking in. Metal Gear Solid © liongear \nIt's not the first entry in Hideo Kojima's world-famous tactical espionage action series – that honour falls to Metal Gear on the MSX home computer, which arrived in 1987 – but 1998's Metal Gear Solid is undoubtedly the title which turned it into one of the gaming world's most popular franchises. Kojima and his team harnessed the 3D power of Sony's console to create a movie-like outing which featured action, stealth, puzzle-solving and memorable characters, establishing the groundwork for a series which would culminate in 2015's Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain . Kojima has now parted company with Konami and is working on new projects, which makes it even more important to experience this '90s classic with a fresh pair of eyes.
