Prior to seeing the show, students spent several weeks in their classrooms studying Alexander Hamilton and the nation’s founding fathers.\n Gallery “What’s up Chicago?!” bellowed the emcee, “Hamilton” cast member Wallace Smith. “We’ve got 13 performances that are going to knock your socks off. Are you excited to be in the room where it happens?!”\nThe crowd responded with a frenzied roar.\nThere were Jovan Castillo and Julio Mendez, two students from Von Steuben Metropolitan Science Center, who created a rap version of the 1804 duel between Hamilton and then sitting Vice President Aaron Burr, which ended with the V.P. mortally wounding his bitter rival.\nThe students drew on historical letters to help reimagine the duel, which ends with Hamilton collapsing on stage.\n“Aaron Burr was a lot more aggressive during the rap because in his letters, he’s a big instigator,” Mendez explained.\nSeveral performers made 21st century references in their work, including Castillo and Mendez.\n“You’re the worst V.P. to step in D.C. since the goof Mike Pence!” spat Castillo’s Hamilton to Mendez’s Burr, referring to the current vice president.\nSaavedra and Gallardo-Arias’ piece also referenced the current political divisions, talking of the need to fight against inequality in the same way the forefathers battled the “Red Coat enemies.”\n“Isn’t this the land of the free? The home of the brave?” said Saavedra. “Washington must be rolling in his grave.”\nSaavedra said a little later that she was referring to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.\n“You can’t ban immigrants,” said Saavedra, who is Hispanic. “We are the ones who made America. We still make America.”\nThe students’ proud teacher, Nail Sabanagic, said he didn’t encourage them to be political but didn’t mind that they were.\n“It’s important that we stand up and speak out against things we feel are wrong,” Sabanagic said later. “They came up with that on their own.”\nAfter the student performances, several members of the “Hamilton” cast sat on stage and participated in a Q&A, talking about the life of professional actors, researching their roles and the appeal of the show.\n“Everybody listens to it,” said Chris De’Sean Lee, who plays Thomas Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette. “People who look like you listen to it. Eighty-year-old white women and men are quoting . . . hip-hop lyrics. That’s beautiful.”\n ", "external_links": ["https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-002_67233923.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-002_67233923.jpg?w=800&#038;h=600&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-003_67233953.jpg?w=800&#038;h=600&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-005_67233959.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-012_67234235.jpg?w=800&#038;h=600&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-006_67233991.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-013_67234003.jpg?w=670", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-004_67233989.jpg?w=800&#038;h=600&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-007_67233993.jpg?w=800&#038;h=600&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-006_67233991.jpg?w=800&#038;h=600&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-009_67234187.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=763&#038;crop=1", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/hH_Of2daww0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-003_67233953.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-009_67234187.jpg?w=800&#038;h=600&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-013_67234003.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-004_67233989.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-001_67234071.jpg?w=800&#038;h=600&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-008_67234131.jpg?w=800&#038;h=600&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-007_67233993.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-005_67233959.jpg?w=800&#038;h=600&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-008_67234131.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-012_67234235.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-013_67234003.jpg?w=800&#038;h=600&#038;crop=1", "https://suntimesmedia.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hamilton-022317-001_67234071.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683&#038;crop=1"], "published": "2017-02-23T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T08:46:23.179+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
