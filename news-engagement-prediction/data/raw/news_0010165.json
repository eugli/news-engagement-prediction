There is no policy for which the Liberal Party and the government stands today, which is not the same as the platform on which Senator Bernardi sought election by the people of SA only seven months ago\". \n\"What Senator Bernardi has done today is not a conservative thing to do because breaking faith with the electorate, breaking faith with the people who voted for you, breaking faith with the people who have supported you through thick and thin for years.\" \nLabor senate leader Penny Wong said the defection underlined just how divided the Coalition was under Mr Turnbull, and that the Prime Minister was \"leading a government that doesn't have an agenda, that doesn't have a philosophical framework\". \nSenator Bernardi's defection had been in the offing for years, though he had previously indicated a desire to work for change from within the Liberal Party. \nCabinet ministers Peter Dutton, Barnaby Joyce, Steve Ciobo and Christopher Pyne led the criticism of Senator Bernardi, with Mr Dutton labelling it a \"betrayal\" and Mr Ciobo pointing out he had spent more time criticising his own colleagues than Labor. \nWhen he spoke to the Prime Minister on Tuesday morning, Senator Bernardi said to Mr Turnbull that he was quitting, in part, because of the removal of Tony Abbott in 2015, while also warning there were discussions underway to remove Mr Turnbull. \nMr Turnbull, in turn, is said to have asked Senator Bernardi how he could justify leaving the Liberal Party just seven months after he was elected on the party's ticket - a question the turncoat could not answer. \nThe South Australian received just 2043 first preference votes as the second candidate on the Liberal Party ticket at the 2016 election, or 0.025 per cent of a quota. \nIn comparison, the Liberal Party received 345,767 votes, underscoring the point made by angry Liberals that the vast majority of voters cast their preference for a party, not an individual in the Senate. \nFormer prime minister Tony Abbott said Senator Bernardi \"has made an important contribution to our public life and I deeply regret his decision to leave the Liberal Party\". \nIn an apparent reference to Mr Turnbull's leadership, Mr Abbott added: \"while Cory and I have sometimes disagreed I'm disappointed that more effort has not been made to keep our party united\". \nWA MP Andrew Hastie said Senator Bernardi was a friend but \"I wish that he had attended the Liberal Party room meeting this morning, looked us all in the eye and explained his reasons\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T09:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:39:57.897+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
