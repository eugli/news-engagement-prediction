Top 5 / Top 10 23 Feb 2017, 10:49 IST One of the all-time greats: AC Milan \nEuropean football is the home of the most competitive club scene. Spread across the continent – and dominated mostly by six countries – the domestic clubs fight for local and European glory every year. Yet, there are only a handful of clubs who have risen about the rest and have truly cemented themselves as true European giants. \nThe following ten teams are those who have excelled both domestically and in Europe. While it may come across that some of the teams have prioritised certain competitions over others, it's fair to say that's how their hierarchy sees the club making the most amount of money. And some of these teams have truly dominated in 'weaker’ leagues but once again, they're on the list only because they pushed for one thing and one thing alone: success. \nGetting to it, here's looking at ten of the most successful European football clubs of all time based on major trophies won: \n(Also excludes single-game trophies like the FA Community Shield and the UEFA Super Cup) #10 AC Milan – 34 major trophies \nOne of only two Serie A teams to make it to this list is Milanese giants AC Milan. Having fielded some of the all-time greats with the likes of Paulo Maldini and Franco Baresi, the Rossoneri are the tenth most successful European football club having won a total of 34 major trophies. \nThat number includes 18 Serie A (or Italian top-flight) titles, 7 UEFA Champions League (or European Cup) titles, 5 Italian Cups and 4 FIFA Club World Cups. Their most recent Serie A title came in 2010/11 with their most recent UEFA Champions League title coming only in 2006/07 season. \nThey remain one of the all-time greats and a club with rich history, legacy and one that connects to football fans on more than an emotional level.
