Now led by Mohamed Kozbar, it is seen as a model of community relations.\n\nMonsoori said the mosque’s management company started proceedings for libel against Reuters Ltd in March 2016.\n\nThe mosque said in a statement: “It is unacceptable that any organisation is able to designate people as terrorists on the basis of poor research and for those people to be labelled without any recourse to truth or justice.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T16:35:18.727+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
