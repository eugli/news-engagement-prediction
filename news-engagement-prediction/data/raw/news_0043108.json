By Peggy Truong Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below A judge has ordered Chris Brown to stay away from ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran after he allegedly made repeated threats at her, The Associated Press reports. The order specifies that Brown must stay 100 yards away from Tran, not attempt any contact with her, and surrender any firearms he has. TMZ first reported the news on Tuesday and obtained a sworn statement Tran submitted to the judge. According to Tran, who dated the singer on and off before splitting up for good in 2015, Brown “told a few people that he was going to kill me,” adding that he told friends that if he can’t date her, no one else can. In late January, Brown made similar comments in an Instagram story video: A post shared by Chris Brown (@chrisbrownioficial) on Jan 30, 2017 at 10:21pm PST Tran also claims in her statement that Chris “punched me in my stomach twice” and “pushed me down the stairs” several years ago, which TMZ points out is likely around the time he was on probation for assaulting Rihanna. Brown has allegedly been sending multiple threats in text messages to Tran since December, according to The AP . Follow Peggy on Twitter .
