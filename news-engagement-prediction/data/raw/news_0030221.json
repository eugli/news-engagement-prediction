The Detroit rapper's latest LP sold 151,000 total copies in its first week to give him consecutive Billboard 200 chart-toppers. Related Review: Big Sean Still Trying to Find Himself on 'I Decided' Our take on star rapper's fourth album \nHowever for Big Sean, while 2015's Dark Sky Paradise sold 173,000 total – and 139,000 traditional – albums on its way to Number One two years ago, I Decided only managed to move 65,000 traditional copies, either physical or digital album sales, in its debut week, Billboard reports . \nAs for Gaga, two of her albums surged from the depths of the album charts back into the Top 10: Her latest album Joanne jumped from Number 66 to Number Two following her triumphant Super Bowl 51 halftime performance , selling 74,000 copies. The Fame went from off the Billboard 200 up to Number Six thanks to a 986 percent increase in sales totaling 38,000 copies. \nFurther down, Born This Way landed at Number 25, while Artpop reentered the Billboard 200 at Number 174. \nThree more newcomers debuted in the Top 10 this week: Reba McEntire's Sing It Now: Songs of Faith & Hope dropped in at Number Four, the Broadway cast recording of Dear Evan Hansen entered at Number Eight – the highest Broadway cast album debut since Camelot hit Number Four in 1961 – and the compilation The RCA-List, Vol. 1 at Number 10. \nLast week's champ, Migos' Culture , fell two spots to Number Three. The Weeknd's Starboy (Number Five), Bruno Mars' 24K Magic (Seven) and Post Malone's Stoney (Nine) rounded out the Top 10. \nNext week, Beyonce, Adele, Drake, Justin Bieber or Sturgill Simpson will hope their Album of the Year Grammy win will propel them back into the upper reaches of the charts.
