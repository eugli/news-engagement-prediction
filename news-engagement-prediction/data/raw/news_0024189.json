He might be known for more dance-heavy moments, but he showed that he’s more than just a pair of happy feet. Mars played an electric white guitar and did right by Prince when he delivered a killer guitar solo that evoked the Purple One’s raw sexuality. \nWhile some tributes crumble under the weight of expectations, Mars proved the right artist to pay tribute to the icon, giving fans a performance to remember. With the Revolution going on tour, perhaps Mars has a few extra dates in his schedule to hook up with them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T06:35:03.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
