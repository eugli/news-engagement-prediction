He lives well but he has been careful not to create any scenes or trouble ... he wants to stay.’ \nSouth China Morning Post revealed the unassuming, low-key lifestyle being lived on the doorstep of Hong Kong by the son and possible next ruler of the Stalinist North Korean nation. \n’s high-end hotels. \n’s US-led casino boom and being led by such glitzy establishments as the Sands, Wynn or Galaxy casinos. \n’s outer island. \nThe hotel is partly owned by Macaus original casino mogul Stanley Ho Hung-sun, a tycoon known to have his own ties to Pyongyang, having previously attempted casino ventures in North Korea. \nJong-nam has also lived for spells in other Macau hotels, particularly when he fears the scrutiny of the outside world. \nWhenever he returns from his frequent trips to Beijing, Bangkok, Moscow and Europe, Jong-nam always seems to celebrate his return in style. \n‘’s when he parties the hardest,’ said one source. ‘He likes the company of old friends.’ \nHe is apparently satisfied with the lifestyle he has forged over the past three years, using Macau as a base for his frequent foreign forays. Other members of family less close to him remain in Beijing. \nBut while Jong-nam continues to enjoy the pleasures of a relaxed Macau existence, western and Asian diplomats now eagerly tracing his movements believe it may be a lifestyle that cannot be sustained. \nThe economic and diplomatic squeeze on Pyongyang is intensifying after its first nuclear test last October. \nEven before the incident, Macaus three-decade links to North Korea were under pressure. Some US$24mil (RM107mil) in North Korean accounts at Macau’s Banco Delta Asia remain frozen, with the bank in receivership. \nJong-nam's continued presence in Macau, while entirely legal, may prove an embarrassment, particularly as the Macau government attempts to show it is no longer willing to act as North Koreas only significant foreign financial centre. \n‘’ve got some tough decisions to make now,’ said one western diplomat. \n‘’ \nHowever, his lifestyle raises other, longer-term questions. Given his jovial nature and late-night habits, there is nothing in his Macau existence that suggests any kind of political ambition. \nJong-nam is a natural optimist, someone who likes to keep himself happy, according to sources quoted yesterday by one media outlet. \n‘’ Kim Jong-il - one of the biggest events of the year on the North’s calendar of Stalinist pageantry. \nNorth Korea has proved the only dynasty in the history of communism. \n‘’ Kim Il-sung in 1974 - 20 years before he eventually took power on his father’s death in 1994. \nJong-il has never made clear his own favoured successor, sparking widespread speculation that he felt humiliated by his son’’s Narita Airport in 2001. It was seen as the most serious in a string of errors in the eyes of his father. \n\nJapanese and South Korean analysts have noted the lack of bodyguards when Kim Jong-nam travels as further evidence that he is no longer in serious contention for the leadership. \n’ \nA South Korean intelligence report presented to the South Korean parliament in December suggested the dynasty could end with Jong-il. In the event of his sudden death, the report noted, it was most likely that top military officials would take over. \n’ \nJong-nam was born to Jong-il’s mistress, the well-known North Korean actress Sun Hae-rim. \nJong-il’s relationship with Sun was secretive, meaning the young Jong-nam was isolated in his fathers most remote villas. \nVarious accounts outline it as something of a gilded cage, with his father making up for his son’s isolation with lavish gifts and a vast playroom filled with the latest foreign toys. \nBy the time he was 10, he was packed off to study in Geneva and then Moscow, along with his mother and aunt. \nHis mother eventually died in Moscow in 2002 after a long battle with depression. Her son spent a lot of time with her before she died. \nJong-nam is considered bright, mastering foreign languages as well as computer science. \nReturning to Pyongyang from his foreign studies, he held several senior positions in his fathers regime, including on a committee heading the feared domestic intelligence apparatus. \nHis highest profile posting came with his role as head of the Korea Computer Centre in the late 1990s. \nJong-nam recognised the need to adapt and develop the latest information technology, such as voice-recognition software. \nThe cent \n’ \n‘If he has any political future, the events of the next few weeks may provide some indication, said one foreign diplomat. \n‘All eyes will be on Jong-nam and his brothers.’ \nThe Stalinist pageantry now being prepared for the ceremonies could not be further removed from a late-night tot outside the Hang Van Loi Korean eatery in downtown Taipa. - South China Morning Post/ 2007", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T15:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T10:53:48.880+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
