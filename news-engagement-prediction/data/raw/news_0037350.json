A flash flood watch has been issued for Santa Barbara, Ventura and Los Angeles counties from Friday morning through Saturday morning. \nMuch of that rainfall is expected to fall within a short time Friday afternoon and evening, with rain potentially falling at a rate of more than an inch an hour, forecasters said. \n“The Friday morning commute is definitely going to be wet,” but the rain is just going to get heavier as the day progresses, said Kathy Hoxsie, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. \nThe afternoon commute is going to be a mess,” Hoxsie said. “Hopefully people can take a half day off. Being a Friday, I know a lot of people do that anyway. … The evening is shaping up to be nasty.” \nThe storm is likely the strongest to hit the region within the last six years, according to the weather service. \nRainfall began falling on the Central Coast early Thursday and is expected to move into Southern California overnight, Hoxsie said. \nWildfire burn scars in Duarte and Azusa are particularly vulnerable with this storm, she said. \nThe system also is bringing powerful southerly winds that will increase dramatically on Friday, with gusts up to 60 to 70 mph likely over high elevations in Ventura, San Luis Obispo and Los Angeles counties, as well as the Channel Islands and Santa Catalina Island, according to the weather service. Damaging wind gusts are also possible in the Antelope Valley. \n“It’s going to be blowing really well,” Hoxsie said. “We’re trying to tell folks, don’t just do your usual preparation for rain, but also, if you’ve got anything outside that could be moved into the garage, this would be the storm where you should do that.” Latest updates", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T11:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T06:56:55.576+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
