It doesn’t in the health sector - it’s proven.” \nWhen asked what made him change his mind, Nuttall replied: “Because we have groundhog day every year. I could write next January’s headlines regarding the NHS. \n“It will be ‘NHS in crisis, not enough beds, people waiting over 12 hours for people to be put in a bed’. \n“The fact is we haven’t got enough doctors, we haven’t got enough nurses, we haven’t got enough midwives and we as a party will put money into the NHS by cutting the foreign aid budget: £3billion into the NHS, £1.2billion into social care and we’ll take that money from the bloated foreign aid budget.” \nAs well as Nuttall’s hustings speech – in which he called for “more free market introduced into the health service” – the MEP also posted a blog on his website in which he wrote: “I would argue that the very existence of the NHS stifles competition, and as competition drives quality and choice, innovation and improvements are restricted.” \nThe blog has since been deleted. Peter Byrne/PA Wire Paul Nuttall and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage dodge an egg thrown at them while campaigning in Stoke \nLabour are keen to highlight Nuttall’s previous position, and speaking to the Huff Post UK today, the Shadow Health Secretary said: “I know when I was talking to people on the streets of Stoke last time I was here people don’t want a candidate who has apparently supported the privatisation of the NHS in the past. \n“That’s something that’s coming up on the doorstep.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T01:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T20:30:50.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
