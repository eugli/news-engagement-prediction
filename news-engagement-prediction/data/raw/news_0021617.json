Obstruction by Democrats! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) ID: 10486548 \nThe overall pace of getting a cabinet has been slower for Trump than other recent presidents, and he had fewer nominees confirmed on inauguration day than Obama, George W. Bush, or Clinton, according to the Washington Post . But it’s actually months too early to say if Trump really is facing the longest delay in US history before getting a full cabinet. \nAfter President Obama took office in January 2009, for example, Hilda Solis wasn’t confirmed as Labor Secretary until February 24 — more than a month after inauguration day. \nOther nominees took even longer. After two other nominees withdrew their names, Gary Locke finally became Obama’s secretary of commerce on March 24, 2009. And Kathleen Sebelius became Health and Human Services secretary on April 28, 2009, after Tom Daschle, Obama’s first choice, pulled out. \nDuring Bill Clinton’s presidency, Janet Reno wasn’t confirmed as attorney general until March 11. In 1989, George H.W. Bush had four cabinet nominees who weren’t confirmed until March. \nThe reasons for the delays varied, with some nominees withdrawing their names over various conflicts. One of Bush’s nominees was actually voted down by the Senate — a fate Trump’s nominees are unlikely to face with a Republican controlled congress. Still, Democratic senators, such as Elizabeth Warren, have been pushing to stall some of Trump’s nominees for as long as possible. \nI will not be silent about a nominee for AG who has made derogatory & racist comments that have no place in our justice system. — Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) ID: 10486545 \nStill, whatever the cause — which Trump did not discuss or mention on Twitter — multiple other presidents also did not have full cabinets in place 19 days into their first terms. 3.
