They have worked hard all off-season. \n“The boys putting their hands up for those positions have trained really well. \n“We’ve got some good players in there. I think we can give it a good shake.” \nThe Broncos look a more balance squad on paper this season with a representative back row, talented centres and fullback Darius Boyd in career-best form. media_camera Can Tevita Pangai Junior take the next step? \nHalves Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt will play a major role in the club’s success, but there is no doubt they need a strong foundation to play off. \nThere are plenty of contenders for forward positions, but whether they possess the experience and quality needed to take Brisbane deep into the finals remains to be seen. \nTevita Pangai Jnr has been the pick of the young forwards throughout the pre-season and is a certainty for Bennett’s round one team while Jai Arrow played 12 games in his debut season last year. \nFrancis Molo played one of his best games in a Broncos jersey in Saturday’s trial win against Wynnum-Manly to throw his name into the mix. \nRookie George Fai has jumped out of the box during the pre-season while Knights recruit Korbin Sims is expected to face the Sharks after landing in Brisbane a month ago. media_camera Sims has impressed since joining Brisbane. \n“He’s been really good,” Blair said of Sims. \n“I’ve played with him twice now and watched his (trial) game against the Sharks. \n“He is a big body and is something we need coming off our bench or whether he is starting. \n“He’s done as much as he can (to earn a position). He’s worked really hard in the games and trained hard.” \nBlair, a 239-game NRL veteran, played 40 minutes straight against Wynnum-Manly and said he was ready for the season despite not travelling to England. \n“I’m all about looking after my family and making sure they are ready to go,” he said. \n“I know it’s going to be a long year so I’m happy I was here. \n“It would have been nice to play with the boys but it wasn’t to be.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T05:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:48:55.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
