Governor Ruto said the South Rift is not a preserve of any political outfit. The governor said that Jubilee has nothing in terms of development for South Rift residents. He told President Uhuru Kenyatta not to send \"political brokers\" to the region. By RUTH MBULA More by this Author \nBomet Governor Isaac Ruto has welcomed the National Super Alliance (Nasa) to the South Rift, saying they have the right to seek votes in the region perceived to be a Jubilee stronghold. \nMr Ruto spoke on Tuesday evening, the same day opposition leader Raila Odinga said that the alliance’s first rally will be in Bomet this Saturday. \nThe governor, who quit Jubilee and formed his own party, Chama Cha Mashinani, did not, however, indicate whether he will join the opposition alliance. \nHe said Bomet residents will only support presidential candidates who respect them and that Nasa leaders are free to seek for support in his county. \nSpeaking in Emurua Dikirr Constituency on Tuesday evening when he joined MP Johanna Ng'eno and his Narok West counterpart Patrick Ntutu to launch the construction of Murkan-Chebara-Soget road and distribute funds to women groups, the three leaders said they had teamed up to fight Jubilee in the South Rift. \nDEMOCRATIC RIGHT \n\"We welcome Nasa because it is their democratic right to campaign anywhere in the country. South Rift is not a preserve of some political outfits that lack respect for the electorate and elected leaders,\" said Mr Ruto. \nWhile announcing the formation of Nasa at Serena Hotel on Tuesday, Mr Odinga said the Bomet rally will be held following Mr Ruto's request. \nGovernor Ruto said he will work with the two Narok MPs to deny Jubilee Party breathing space in the South Rift and beyond. \n\"We will ensure we suffocate Jubilee in Bomet and Narok Counties. They have shown us clearly that they have no value for us,” he said. \nThe governor said that Jubilee has nothing in terms of development for South Rift residents and urged voters from the region to support a party that had a clear development plan for them. \n\"We have always told President Uhuru Kenyatta that we support him. \n\"But he might be in for a rude shock during the August general election if he continues sending us political brokers to intimidate, abuse and disrespect us, \"said Mr Ruto. \nBRACE FOR TOUGH TIMES \nHe added that the South Rift people will not be taken for a ride again and asked Jubilee to brace for tough times in the region if the president will not heed their call. \n\"All that we are demanding is respect. The political brokers working with the President have always felt too big for us. We will not allow this to go on,\" he said. \nMr Ntutu said he had decamped from Jubilee to a party that he will announce later in the month. \nWhile signalling that he might move to Mr Ruto's Chama Cha Mashinani, Mr Ntutu said political brokers in Jubilee had ruined the party's chances of gaining popularity in Narok. \n\"I have moved from Jubilee. I will no longer work with the party and let it be known that no amount of persuasion will convince me [to go] back,” said the MP who was elected on a URP ticket. \nMr Ng'eno said they will spearhead a massive campaign to deny Jubilee Party presence in the region.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T13:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T08:33:07.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
