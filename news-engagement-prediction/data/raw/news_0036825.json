By Caroline Bologna \nOn Thursday, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) announced a product recall for two kinds of Britax strollers. \nThe recall, which was issued by Britax , concerns the B-Agile and BOB Motion Strollers with click-and-go receivers. According to the CPSC, “a damaged receiver mount on the stroller can cause the car seat to disengage and fall unexpectedly, posing a fall hazard to infants in the car seat.” CPSC Britax-B-Agile stroller in travel system mode. \nThe strollers in question have been available at retailers like Target and Babies “R” Us since 2011. Since that time, about 676,000 of these strollers have been sold in the U.S., with an additional 36,400 in Canada and 4,600 in Mexico, the CPSC noted . \nThe issue arises when the products are in travel system mode, when the car seat component is attached to the stroller frame using click and go receivers. \nBritax issued the recall after receiving 33 reports of car seats unexpectedly disconnecting from the stroller component and falling to the ground. In 26 cases, these incidents resulted in injuries like scratches, bruises, cuts and bumps to the head.
