Let's go! #HottyToddy \n— Shea Patterson (@SheaPatterson_1) February 26, 2017 \nHugh Freeze didn’t hesitate to weigh-in and offer his support. You will be a great leader https://t.co/In9WAIehUa \n— Hugh Freeze (@CoachHughFreeze) February 26, 2017 \nThis is huge news for the Ole Miss program, for a number of different reasons. \nFor starters, Patterson is a superb talent. Coming out of high school he was a consensus five-star player, rated by some as the best quarterback in the class of 2016 . \nBeyond that: The Rebels need him. This is a school that finished 5-7 last year, and was a total dud on the recruiting trail this year. Coach Hugh Freeze went so far as to admit how the looming NCAA investigation had hurt recruiting efforts. It is totally understandable why the ban would be a turnoff. \nAnd no one could have blamed Patterson if he decided to leave. Remember, former five-star quarterback Jarrett Stidham announced he was leaving Baylor last year after Art Briles was fired, and other players have left other schools (Penn State, USC) when NCAA sanctions hit and bowl bans were handed out. While Ole Miss obviously self-imposed its ban (NCAA punishment awaits) it would have been easy for Patterson to start over elsewhere. \nInstead he’ll stick by his program, at the moment it needs him most.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T03:54:41.354+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
