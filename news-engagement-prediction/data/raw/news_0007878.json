JB-9.\nNow, the Van Nuys, California based company has its eyes on making use of the space above us to transport people.\nUber is also trying to take on this space with plans to launch a flying taxi service in the future called Uber Elevate.\nThe company is run by David Mayman, the CEO, and Nelson Tyler, the chief designer, who have been demonstrating their jetpack in test flights across the the US and Europe -

and they've also recently announced that their jetpacks are available to buy now.\nUBER ELEVATE'S PLAN Uber has a plan to launch a fleet of electric aircraft for on-demand aviation.\nThe plan, called Uber Elevate, is set to design these 'cars' to take off and land vertically, travel 100 miles on a single charge and has set 2021 as the ready date.\nThe vehicles will be a vertical-takeoff-and-landing (VTOL) plane with the ability to fly 100 miles on a single charge at 150 mph max.\nThey will have fixed wings with tilt prop-rotors, which also makes for a much quieter ride.\nUber says its design will be 15 decibels quieter than traditional helicopters.\nAnd the firm sees using preexisting urban heliports and skyscrapers as launch and landing pads.\nThe cars will also have enough room for a pilot and multiple passengers.\nBut the company is now working on a new project to build the first viable flying car.\nMr Mayman, the CEO, told New Atlas that while some other companies, such as Joby and Airbus, are working on high-speed winged aircraft that can travel at 2-300 miles an hour (320-480 km/h), JPA is working on a different concept.\n'We're on the other side.\n'We're taking the manned multirotor approach.\n'More than anything else, because some of the technology's already proven enough.\n'The speeds are lower â€“ you might be talking about 90 miles an hour (145 km/h), but the size factor is so much smaller because you don't have a wing to deal with.'\nJPA's flying car design has six arms that come out from the top of the chassis, with two at the front, two at the middle and two at the back - with the middle ones able to fold in.\nMr Mayman also said that the vehicle would be low and thin enough to fit inside a one-space garage.\nInstead of traditional landing skids, the design has little balls at the bottom.\nWhile the design currently only has one seat, it could be upgraded for more if it weren't for the problem of limited battery power capacity\nThe team plans to fit the aircraft with 12 customized wooden propellers instead of carbon propellers because wooden props are very light and more resistant to damage\nThe team plans to fit the aircraft with 12 customized wooden propellers instead of carbon propellers, as wooden props are very light and more resistant to damage.\nMr Mayman says that the type of aircraft JPA is designing could fly close to the ground, at about 2 meters (6.5 feet).\nWhile the design currently only has one seat, it could be upgraded for more if it weren't for the ultimate problem of limited battery power capacity.\nBut Mr Mayman estimates that in about four years, it might double.\nBut to get around that, the team is looking to design an type of electric car system with a power generator on board.\nAside from the problem of limited batter power, CEO Mr Mayman said drone technology has advanced autopilot and stabilization technologies, so much so that there's very little R&D to do\nThey're looking to build in a very small turbine motor the size of a coke can, which they've had experience with when developing their jetpacks.\nThis kind of a motor could produce a lot of power as a generator.\nAside from the battery power problem, Mr Mayman said drone technology has advanced autopilot and stabilization technologies, so much so that there's very little R&D to do.\nCEO Mr Mayman said that it would take about six months to develop the first prototype of the flying car if the company has the right cashflows\nIn terms of how safe the device is, the team is working on the basis that you could lose half your motors and still fall at a safe rate, but they're also looking into an undercarriage system that can collapse in a certain way, a ballistic parachute to slow a crash down, and airbag cushion system.\nMr Mayman said that it would take about six months to develop the first prototype of the flying car if the company has the right cashflows.\n'We're working as if it's a two dimensional world, traveling in serial, car after car after car,' he said.\n'All this airspace above us is completely unutilized between 100 and 1,000 feet.\n'One day, that space will be used.\n'We've got plans on being a part of that.'", "external_links": ["http://newatlas.com/david-mayman-vtol-flying-car-jpa-interview/47700/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-04T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T13:52:21.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
