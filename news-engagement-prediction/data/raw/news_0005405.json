Trump jokes about Arnold Schwarzenegger as host of \"Apprentice\": \"I want to just pray for Arnold if we can for those ratings.\" pic.twitter.com/hNy115htJr \n— ABC News (@ABC) February 2, 2017 \n“When I ran for president, I had to leave the show. That’s when I knew for sure I was doing it,” Trump suggested in an echo of his previous claims he wasn’t fired by NBC despite the broadcaster’s statement to the contrary. “And they hired a big, big movie star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to take my place, and we know how that turned out,” Trump said. “The ratings went right down the tubes. It’s been a total disaster. And Mark will never, ever bet against Trump again, and I want to just pray for Arnold, if we can, for those ratings, okay?” The National Prayer Breakfast? pic.twitter.com/KYUqEZbJIE \n— Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) February 2, 2017 \nSchwarzenegger responded to Trump on Twitter in a video, saying, “Hey Donald, I have a great idea. Why don’t we switch jobs? You take over TV, because you’re such an expert in ratings, and I take over your job, and then people can finally sleep comfortably again.” \nThis isn’t the first time the pair have traded public jabs. During the campaign season, the former governor endorsed John Kasich during the primaries and said he would “not vote for the Republican candidate” after Trump’s Access Hollywood tape was released. \nEarlier this week, in reference to Trump’s executive order banning immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries, Schwarzenegger said the order “was vetted badly” and that “there is another way of going about it to do it the right way and to accomplish still all the same goals. And so I think that they were hasty with it.” \nA spokesman for Schwarzenegger also sent a statement to ABC News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:03:48.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
