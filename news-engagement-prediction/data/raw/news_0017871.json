The actress, who takes the spotlight in Neeraj Pandey 's 'Naam Shabana' has not left any stone unturned to bring life to her character in the film. \n\nThe over two-minute long trailer sees the versatile actor Manoj Bajpayee narrating a gist of the storyline which then takes us to the character narration of Taapsee a.k.a Shabana. Taapsee gets her hands on one of the major projects handled by the secret forces for which she had to move overseas. When asked if someone's there to support her and give her company, Manoj proudly proclaims that he has sent the \"best of the best\" from his team. Here comes Akshay Kumar I'm total swag. He channels the angry young man rather well. \n\nThe trailer looks rather promising. The film is being touted to be a prequel to Akshay Kumar's 2015 hit 'Baby.'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T16:43:32.268+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
