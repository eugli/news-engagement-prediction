(Photo: AP) \nMartellus Bennett is a Super Bowl champion and champion tweeter , and on Tuesday he told several stories. \nOne of those stories was about Magic Johnson, which was perfect timing since Magic was named the Lakers president of basketball operations on Tuesday. Some saw this news as a good thing, others see it as a very bad thing, but everyone was making jokes on Twitter , so when Martellus tweeted this, people thought it was a funny way to burn Magic. I had a conversation with Magic Johnson when I was 21 and a rookie. Damn I wish I had that 5 minutes back. — Martellus Bennett (@MartysaurusRex) February 21, 2017 \nGot him! Martellus wishes he never talked to Magic! But the thing is, that's not what the Patriots tight end was trying to say. He was trying to say that he wished he had used those five minutes more wisely. He explained in a couple of more tweets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:49:58.624+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
