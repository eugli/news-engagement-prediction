Off-grid interest spikes after blackouts \nA number of companies have sprung up in response to rising demand from property owners to rely less, or not at all, on electricity providers. One in seven homes in Australia has solar panels on their roof. But what are they and how do they work? \nSean LePoidevin from Off Grid Energy said battery-storage technology was improving and electricity bills kept rising for households and businesses. \n\"You certainly get a spike in interest after a blackout, both in South Australia and nationally,\" he said. \n\"Over the last 12 months our interest and sales have grown by about 20 per cent each month, which is a direct correlation to price rises, blackouts and a general perception and knowledge about electricity.\" \nMr Bladon said going off the grid with solar panels and battery-storage gave him peace of mind, and he urged other people to consider doing the same. \n\"It's just nice to know that I've got that security and if the power does fail, I'm OK,\" he said.
