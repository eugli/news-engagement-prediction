First of all, we cannot comment on a matter when it's already in the court, but we can assure you that it's not based on any living or dead person.\" \nThe 29-year-old actress added that \"Rangoon\" is \"completely a fictional story\" and the \"characters are fictional as well\". \n\"Rangoon\", also starring Saif Ali Khan and Shahid Kapoor, will release on Friday. It is set during World War II. Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:06:51.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
