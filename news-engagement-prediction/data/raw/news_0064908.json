Fierce weather is expected across the UK tomorrow (Photo: Rex Features) \nA weather warning for snow is also in place for Scotland, which could see treacherous blizzard-like conditions. \nStorm Doris is expected to move on quickly, with the worst of the weather gone by Thursday evening. \nWhile further Atlantic gusts will bring more rain and wind through the weekend and into next week, they are not expected to reach the heights of Doris. \nStorms with the potential to cause substantial impact are named by the Met Office and Met Eireann, moving through the alphabet. \nThe first was named Abigail in November 2015, after members of the public suggested monikers for the \"name our storms\" project. Forecasters have warned people to prepare for disruption (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Storm Doris (Photo: MetOffice/Twitter) \nForecasters are now in their second run through the alphabet. After Doris, Britons can expect to hear of Ewan, Fleur and Gabriel. \nStorm Doris's appearance contrasts with Monday's temperatures, where visitors to Kew Gardens, west London, enjoyed the warmest day of the winter so far, at 18.3C (64.9F). \nParts of London and the south of England had temperatures warmer than Ibiza, southern Spain and Menorca.
