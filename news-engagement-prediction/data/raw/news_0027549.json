READ: App to promote pharmacies opposed to pill \nMalta Chamber of Pharmacists president Mary Ann Sant Fournier told The Sunday Times of Malta that like other independent healthcare professionals, pharmacists “have a right to conscientious objection” . \n“It is ethical practice to indicate, even within the same pharmacy, which pharmacist would dispense the emergency contraception preparation, thus ensuring access,” Ms Sant Fournier said. \nFollowing the introduction of the emergency contraceptive last year and the decision by the Medicines Authority to make it available over the counter, pharmacists were handed a set of guidelines to abide by when handing out the contraceptive. \nThe guidelines, which outline the dispensing methods and were made available to all pharmacists in December, were “well-received” by those in the industry, Ms Sant Fournier said. Pharmacists are directing customers to other pharmacies \nSources have also claimed that some pharmacists are asking women to take the contraceptive on the spot to ensure its effectiveness. WATCH: Protestors insist on right to emergency contraception \n“It is clear that certain medications may require administration at particular times – this in view of safety, effectiveness and other possible circumstances. It could be appreciated that such administration may need to be managed,” Ms Sant Fournier said. \nThe debate on whether the morning-after pill should be made available made headlines throughout the second half of last year after the Women’s Rights Foundation filed a judicial protest against the State calling for the emergency contraceptive to be licensed. \nSome had slammed the move to make the pill available as an attempt to legalise abortion in Malta. A number of pro-life campaigners have insisted that the contraceptive is abortifacient and should therefore be illegal. \nLast month, two activists who oppose the introduction of the pill filed a judicial protest accusing the Medicines Authority of allowing onto the market pharmaceuticals that can cause a chemical abortion. « Opposition resorting to provocation because it has run out of ideas - PM Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=63067623367&n=2d7802ff' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=63067623367&n=2d7802ff' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T20:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T16:02:15.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
