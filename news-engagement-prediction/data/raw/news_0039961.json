One has to be careful about being critical of the press particularly as a lawyer or judge because our view of life is very different from that of the media. \n\"I think some of what was said was undermining the rule of law.\" What is the Supreme Court? Image copyright EPA \nThe Supreme Court is based in Parliament Square, next to both Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament. \nIt is the final court of appeal in the UK for civil cases, and for criminal cases from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. \nIt hears cases of the greatest public or constitutional importance affecting the whole population. \nIts justices also sit as the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council and as such will occasionally hear appeals against the death penalty from Commonwealth countries. \nIn an average year, the Supreme Court hears around 90 appeals and makes around 80 judgements on important issues of law that shape the way everybody lives. \nAsked whether politicians had responded quickly enough to defend the judiciary and rule of law, Lord Neuberger said: \"They were certainly vocal enough quickly enough after our hearing [in the Supreme Court]. \n\"After the [High] Court hearing. I think they could have been quicker and clearer. But we all learn by experience, whether politicians or judges. It's easy to be critical after the event. They were faced with an unexpected situation from which like all sensible people they learned.\" \nLord Neuberger said that undermining the judiciary also undermined the rule of law as judges were \"the ultimate guardians\" of it. \n\"The rule of law together with democracy is one of the two pillars on which our society is based,\" he added. \n\"And therefore if, without good reason, the media or anyone else undermines the judiciary that risks undermining our society. \n\"The press and the media generally have a positive duty to keep an eye on things. But I think with that with that power comes the degree of responsibility.\" 'The reins are off' Image copyright Getty Images \nBy Clive Coleman, BBC Legal correspondent \nThe country's judges were stung and hurt by the description of three of the most senior members of their ranks as 'enemies of the people'. \nAs a body they feel they cannot respond to such criticism publicly - judges must after all speak through their judgments alone, and the occasional public lecture. \nBeing dragged into the forum of public debate is seen as something that diminishes public confidence in their independence. \nWhilst some senior retired judges such as the former Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge did speak out after the press coverage of the High Court Article 50 ruling, Lord Newberger is the most senior serving judge to do so publicly. \nHe retires in September so perhaps he feels that the reins are off, or at least loosened. \nHis fellow judges will be quietly delighted that he has expressed his views on what they saw as an unfair attack on their independence and the rule of lawâ€¦ but they won't say that publicly. \nThe interview with Lord Neuberger comes on the same day the Supreme Court begins taking applications for new justices. \nAs well as a new president to replace him, there is the need for two further justices after the retirement of Lord Toulson in 2016, and the upcoming retirement of Lord Clarke. \nThe current bench is made up of one woman and 10 men, all white and from affluent backgrounds. \nOn announcing his retirement last year, Lord Neuberger called for a diverse list of candidates to take the jobs. Image copyright AP Image caption The 11 current Supreme Court justices, pictured with Lord Toulson (top row, far left who is now retired) \n\"The higher echelons of the judiciary in the United Kingdom suffer from a marked lack of diversity and here I must admit the Supreme Court does not score at all well,\" he said. \n\"We have one white woman and 10 white men, and, although two of the 11 were not privately educated, none of us come from disadvantaged backgrounds.\" \nApplications will close on 10 March. There will then be shortlisting, interviews and consultation exercises, with the names of the new appointments expected to be announced in July. \nThey will take up office at the beginning of the new legal year in October. \nThree more justices - Lord Mance, Lord Hughes and Lord Sumption - will retire before the end of 2018, as the statutory retirement age for judges is 70.
