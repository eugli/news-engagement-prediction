Dubai residents, next time you travel, remember to carry your Emirates ID to escape the long queues at Dubai's passport control. With your Emirates ID card, you can fast track to the security check in just a matter of 10 to 15 seconds. (Video by Nilanjana Gupta) \"Over the past 12 months we have been working very closely with our partners at GDRFA to try and improve the passenger experience. One of the aspects of that was helping residents get through the immigration process as fast as possible,\" Michael Ibbitson, EVP Business Technology at Dubai Airports told Khaleej Times. The service is available on all 127 Smart Gates across all the three terminals at Dubai International. Use your Emirates ID in three steps 1. Insert your Emirates ID into the machine 2. Scan your boarding pass to prove that you're a valid passenger 3. Give your fingerprint: The machine will check if it matches with your the record that was created when you got your Emirates ID. And you're done, in just 10 to 15 seconds! On departures at all terminals, you can use your Emirates ID and E-Gate card. On arrival at Terminal 3, you can use your Emirates ID, E-Gate card or your biometric passport, if you have one. The biometric passport is limited to certain countries and you need to pre-register. The E-Gate travel card continues to work, however, if you use your with Emirates ID, you don't have to pay for it. It also doesn't require any pre-registration. Speaking to Khaleej Times, Michael Paulsen, a passenger at Terminal 3 said, \"Like always it's so much faster and easier. I travel every second month and I always use my Emirates ID at the E Gates to beat the long queues.\" Do's and Dont's 1. The Emirates ID does take a little while to be read. Don't worry if it takes 10 seconds to read a card. Don't pull it out before it's done. 2. With the fingerprint, make sure you understand which finger it's asking for. When you place your finger on the reader, you don't have to press hard. Just rest your finger and it will read it from there. \"I think the message is quite simple. We don't want people to queue up. We want them to get through the airport as fast as possible. If you use your Emirates ID, we can definitely guarantee that's going to happen,\" added Ibbitson. All UAE residents holding a valid Emirates ID card who are older than 18 years can take advantage of the new system. Families travelling with children below the age of 18 should approach the manned counter adjacent to the smart gates to complete the immigration process.
