I haven’t managed to actually speak to a real estate agent for a rental. Look in the same areas and there will be more than 40 rooms or whole houses listed on Airbnb. It’s infuriating,” she said. \nMelbourne woman Sarah Clayton is now considering buying a house because it seems impossible to rent. She is living with her boyfriend and parents and has been inspecting rentals since November. She acknowledges she is lucky to be in a privileged position where she can purchase a home, but said she never would have done it if she had the choice to rent. \n“I’ve been to inspect a few homes and the lines are ridiculous. I went to one the other day and left work early to attend. I’d booked an appointment and thought it was a private inspection but as I drove past I saw a line. There was a snake of people in clusters of two and three wanting to go in,” she said. \nMs Clayton said there was an oversupply of one-bedroom apartment shoe boxes that nobody wanted to live in and there was a shortage of rentals in desired suburbs such as Fitzroy and Brunswick. \nSophie Bridges has been looking for a new home in the inner city for three months as her current rental is starting to fall apart. \nShe has spent her Saturdays lining up to inspect rentals, along with 50 other people. \nOne landlord asked Ms Bridges to pay an extra $400 in bond just to have her cat there. \nMs Bridges said housing was not affordable and more and more people were opting to rent rather than purchase homes. She also believes the city is overpopulated and there’s not enough housing supply to meet the demand. media_camera Sophie Bridges has struggled to find a rental in Melbourne. Picture: Facebook \nIn her mid-20s, Ms Bridges said families were getting priority over young people and she’s had friends who have been forced to move back home because they’ve got nowhere to live. \nMs Bridges even knows a homeless man who was kicked out of his rental when he lost his job. He was rejected from every home he looked at after that because he was blacklisted for not paying rent after he lost his job. \nSuzy Pastro and her partner have been looking for a home to rent in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, in places like Coburg or Preston. \nThey aren’t picky, all they’re looking for is a home with a backyard for their two dogs and a good kitchen. \nThey are currently living with a housemate in Coburg, but they want to have more space and privacy as a couple. Their budget is between $400 and $500 a week but that’s still not enough for them to find a decent home. \n“What we’re finding within our price range are older properties that have the 1960s style kitchens. Some barely have cupboard doors,” she said. \n“Then we find something we really like and within our budget but then there’s no yard.” \nTHERE’S A SHORTAGE OF RENTALS \nDomain Group chief economist Andrew Wilson said lots of properties bought by investors were never rented out because they are often kept empty by foreign investors or solely leased out on sites like Airbnb. \nMelbourne University professor of urban planning, Carolyn Whitzman, said Victoria was the only state that did not have an affordable housing strategy. \nShe said people’s panic was increasing when it came to the number of homeless people in Melbourne’s CBD. \nShe added that there were three things contributing to the housing crisis at the moment — an inadequate amount of social housing, not enough cheap market rental housing, and no option of affordable home ownership. \n“Young people who can’t afford homes will move into rental properties and that then displaces people who have fewer resources,” she said. “The unaffordable housing has an impact on cheap rentals which then has an impact on those who need social housing.” \nProfessor Whitzman said it was no surprise Melbourne was gripped with a homelessness problem because there had been no attempt to tackle the housing crisis. \n“There’s virtually no affordable housing in central Melbourne available to low income people,” she said. \n“I think a lot would be happy with affordable housing if they didn’t have to share with other people. There seems to be a generational shift with people getting driving licences later and people getting married later so there is a strong preference to live in the central city and not move to the suburbs,” she said. \nGen Y-ers are currently caught up in generation rent. It doesn’t mean they are completely locked out of home ownership, but they are finding it a lot more difficult to get into the housing market. \nProfessor Whitzman said there’s the mindset people needed to purchase homes to be considered successful and she said that was also part of the problem. \nShe said now more people were renting for longer and there needed to be a strategy to ensure the homes were there.
