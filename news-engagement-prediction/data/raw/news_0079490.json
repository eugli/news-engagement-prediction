She spent 10 years in prison for her crimes. She was an alleged former member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which is a designated terrorist group. She was also convicted for her role in the bombing of a British consulate. \nIn 2004, she lied about her past criminal record and succeeded in becoming a United States citizen. She was ultimately convicted of immigration fraud in 2014 but won the right to a new trial, scheduled to take place in Spring 2017. She convinced the judge to grant a new trial by claiming PTSD led her to falsify her application for citizenship. \nOdeh, in addition to lending her talents to organizing “A Day Without A Woman,” has apparently inspired the Left to organize to help “free” her from responsibility for her past crimes. A website called “ justice4rasmea.org ” describes Odeh as a hero, but never mentions her conviction or prison sentence: \nRasmea is a community icon who overcame vicious torture by Israeli authorities while imprisoned in Palestine in the 1970s, and an example for the millions of Palestinians who have not given up organizing for their rights of liberation, equality, and return. \nIn fact, when describing her arrest, the website seems to suggest that her lies are mitigated by the fact that they happened 20 years ago: \nIn the early morning of Tuesday, October 22, 2013, then sixty-six year old Rasmea Odeh was arrested at her home by agents from the Department of Homeland Security. She was indicted in federal court, charged with Unlawful Procurement of Naturalization, an allegation based on answers she gave on a 20-year-old immigration application. Rasmea, her supporters, and her legal team say that the immigration charge was nothing but a pretext to attack this icon of the Palestine liberation movement. \nNow, as she awaits her new court date, Odeh has lent her heroic organizing skills to the next iteration of the Women’s March against President Donald Trump. According to womensmarch.com , the official website for the event, the march is an attempt to “creatively withdraw” from harmful corporations. \n“On March 8th, International Women’s Day, women and our allies will act together creatively to withdraw from the corporations that harm us and find ways to support the businesses, organizations and communities that sustain us,” declares the Women’s March website, profiling its “Day Without a Woman.” Further questions, according to the March’s Twitter feed, include the following: “Do businesses support our communities, or do they drain our communities? Do they strive for gender equity or do they support the policies and leaders that perpetuate oppression? Do they align with a sustainable environment or do they profit off destruction and steal the futures of our children?” \nThe women’s march on Washington, D.C., in January drew five million participants worldwide and over one million in Washington alone.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T00:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T20:06:18.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
