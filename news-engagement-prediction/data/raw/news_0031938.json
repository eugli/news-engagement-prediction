I think that's something we're going to learn.\"\nCassidy took over earlier in the week when the Bruins fired Claude Julien, who was in his 10th season and coached the team to a 2011 Stanley Cup win. Boston also won in Cassidy's debut, 6-3 over San Jose on Thursday.\nFrank Vatrano added a goal and two assists for the Bruins, who posted their fifth win in seven games.\n\"He expects a lot out of his players,\" said forward Vatrano, who played under Cassidy in Providence of the AHL. \"He wants to you to play to your capabilities and expects the guys to compete night in and night out.\"\nBackup goaltender Anton Khudobin made 29 saves for Boston. Ryan Miller had 26 for the Canucks.\n\"To give it up with two minutes left is hard,\" Vancouver coach Willie Desjardins said.\nThe Canucks had tied it at 3-all on Markus Granlund's goal with 5:37 left in the third.\n\"I thought we battled hard enough to win,\" said Canucks forward Loui Erikssson, who spent three seasons with the Bruins before signing a $36-million, six-year deal with Vancouver during the off-season.\nPastrnak took a pass along the left wing, slid the puck backward to himself before recollecting it and slipping a wrister past Ryan Miller.\nBo Horvat scored for Vancouver, giving him 100 career points. He's the first Canucks player to reach that mark at 21 years old or younger since Petr Nedved did it at 21 in 1993. Alexandre Burrows had the other goal.\nColin Miller one-timed Jimmy Hayes' drop pass with a rising shot into the net, pushing Boston ahead 3-2 early in the third.\nDown 2-1, the Canucks tied it on Borrows' goal out of a scramble with six-tenths of a second left in the second, his first since Dec. 31.\nWith Boston trailing 1-0, Kevan Miller took a cross-ice pass from Ryan Spooner and fired a wrister that beat Ryan Miller.\nVatrano one-timed a shot into the net from the bottom of the right circle with 38 seconds left in the opening period to make it 2-1. It's the seventh straight game in which Boston scored on a power play.\nWith the fans barely settled into their seats after the Bruins honoured the Super Bowl champion Patriots during an on-ice pregame ceremony, Vancouver moved ahead 1-0 when Horvat scored on a rebound 4:56 into the game.\nPatriots honoured before game The Bruins honoured the Super Bowl champion New England Patriots before Saturday's game.\nFourteen members of the NFL championship team walked onto centre ice wearing Bruins jerseys with their names and numbers on the back.\nRunning back James White ‚Äî who scored three touchdowns in New England's 34-28 comeback win over Atlanta last Sunday, including the game winner in the first Super Bowl to ever go into overtime ‚Äî dropped the ceremonial first puck.\nNice job, @SweetFeet_White üëè pic.twitter.com/HIaw750ftK\n‚Äî @NHLBruins Special teams captain Matthew Slater and linemen Nate Solder and Sebastian Vollmer were a few of the notable players who participated.\nThere was a video package of highlights of the game played on the Jumbotron before they entered.\n¬© The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/NHLBruins/status/830491691618562050", "https://twitter.com/SweetFeet_White", "http://www.cp.org/", "https://t.co/HIaw750ftK"], "published": "2017-02-11T22:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:19:25.805+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
