PUBLISHED: 01:25, Tue, Feb 14, 2017 | UPDATED: 01:56, Tue, Feb 14, 2017 \nThe INSA institute found for the “first time in a long time”, a centre-of-left coalition would force Merkel out of her position as Chancellor, a position she has held since 2005. \nThe Social Democratic Party (SPD) would snatch between 30 to 31 per cent of the vote from the conservatives, while the hard-left Linke party would snag another 10 per cent, the poll found. GETTY Angela Merkel and Martin Schulz are expected to be the main contenders for German Chancellor \nThe pro-environment Greens would swoop seven per cent, giving the trio of leftie parties a combined 48 per cent. \nThat total would leave 47 per cent for the other three parties – including Merkel’s right-wing Christian Democratic Union (CDU) – unlikely to clear the five per cent threshold and win seats in parliament, the poll of 2,028 voters found. \nMerkel will be hoping for a resurgence before the elections in November later this year.
