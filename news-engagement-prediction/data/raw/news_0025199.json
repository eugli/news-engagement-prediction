I might not have got out.\" \nHe described the dedication of the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels in shading the wounded with banana leaves, giving them water, and finding them native foods to eat as they made their way to clearing stations where the patients could be transferred for treatment. \n\"They were martyrs ... they really were angels,\" Mr Moore said. 'Nasty' dreams ended after revisiting Kokoda Photo: Alan Moore believes the locals who helped the Allies were treated badly by the Australian Government. (ABC News: Karen Percy) \nMr Laula speaks in a soft voice but his words are strong. \n\"I witnessed a big massacre, one of the last at Kokoda,\" he said with pain in his eyes. \nMr Laula said there were two types of people back then — the enemy, who attacked his village, and the good people, the Australian diggers who looked after the local people. \nSince the war, Mr Moore has been to PNG four times, including a visit in 2012 to mark the 70th anniversary of the Kokoda battles. \nHe was an honoured guest on that occasion and was surprised by the appearance of his granddaughter, who like many Australians these days took a pilgrimage along the Kokoda Track. \nThe visit also helped him deal with the trauma suffered all those years ago. \n\"They didn't tell me [she was coming]\", he said with a smile. \n\"My memories have never gone back to the bad things [of war]. All the nasty dreams stopped at that point.\" \nHe remembers the good times, like knocking coconuts off the trees. 'They were treated very badly' \nMr Moore became an executive at Heinz after the war, and since retiring has volunteered at a Mornington aged-care facility where he now lives. \nFor the past 15 years he has been funding the education of a young villager at Kokoda and has assisted in raising money for kindergartens at numerous villages. \n\"Their grandfathers are the ones who helped us,\" he said. \nIt is his way of giving back to a people he thinks should have been better treated by the Australian Government. \n\"I think they were treated very badly. They were promised things they never got. They were lucky if they got a cup of rice a day,\" he said. \n\"We wouldn't have won the campaign without them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T08:53:22.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
