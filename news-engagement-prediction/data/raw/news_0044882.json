Ad Feedback \n\"We do understand the inconvenience this expected closure may cause to residents and hope it doesn't disrupt their routine too much.\" \nCouncil will continue to monitor conditions and will notify when a decision on the possible closure has been made. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:42:08.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
