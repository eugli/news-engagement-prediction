She has been a reporter at the Inquirersince 1996, covering city government, courts and neighborhoods in Philadelphia and Camden, and the governors and governments of New Jersey and Pennsylvania. More by Angela Couloumbis Arrow icon \nHARRISBURG – An influential Pennsylvania state senator was under fire Monday for comments suggesting that minority students in “inner city” public schools struggle to succeed in college and should instead be encouraged to pursue vocational careers. \n“They’re pushing them toward college and they’re dropping out,” Sen. John Eichelberger, a Blair County Republican, said during a town hall last week near Carlisle. “They fall back and don’t succeed, whereas if there was a less intensive track, they would.” \nEichelberger, who chairs the Senate Education Committee, said Monday that his comments, mentioned in a story by the Carlisle Sentinel, were taken out of context. In an interview, he blamed failing urban school systems -- not their students’ skin color -- for why some graduates falter in college. \n\"They are because of their academic background,\" he said. \"They aren't because they're black. It doesn't matter what the color of their skin is. It matters that they had twelve years of very poor school.” \nStill, his publicized remarks drew fire from Democratic colleagues in the Senate, who called them demeaning and alarming for someone with influence over crafting educational policies for the state. \n\"What I hear is a person saying that students in inner city communities, some of which I represent, are not deserving of the opportunity to go to college — and that they should be geared toward technical schools,\" said Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D., Allegheny). \"I find that offensive.\" \nCosta said members of his caucus were so concerned about Eichelberger's words that he reached out over the weekend to Senate Majority Leader Jake Corman (R., Centre) to discuss the matter. \n\nEichelberger’s comments came during a sparsely attended town hall meeting in his district, in which he answered a range of questions about education and the legislature. \nBarbara Plocki, a retired high school teacher who attended the meeting, said Eichelberger was \"very negative\" during the gathering, and that his comments about success rates for minority students came up in the context of his having visited public schools in Philadelphia. \n\"His statistics were rather dire on the dropout rate,\" Plocki said in an interview Monday. \"And his statistics were rather dire on sending kids from inner city schools to college and not having them succeed. I was disturbed and felt that some of the information he had was not correct.\" \nSen. Vincent Hughes, a Philadelphia Democrat, said he \"went through the roof\" when he read Eichelberger's statments \"because this is the gentleman who as the chairman of the Senate Education Committee has the responsibility of guiding education policy in the state.\" He said he believed Eichelberger did not deserve to chair the Education committee because he has exhibited \"a complete lack of understanding of education policy.\" \n\"His comments about a less intensive track -- that is extremely telling,\" said Hughes, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"He's taking about creating a structured academic environment where these kids will never become the doctors or the lawyers, where these kids will never become the scientists ... when we know that these children can succeed and make contributions to society.\" \nIn the interview Monday, Eichelberger said his perspective stemmed from a visit to Philadelphia, conversations about the city's schools and a constituent's description of a book by Thomas Sowell, a conservative economist at Stanford University. \nAnd he said he believes all students should be able to follow their ambitions. He noted that tradespeople have told him they perceive a stigma around vocational-technical education, and he said that vocational training can lead to high-paying jobs. \n\"Every child, regardless of their background, should be entitled to pursue the pathway that's best for them,\" he said. \"That includes college, vocational training or any other career path.\" \nOne of the Senate’s staunchest conservatives, Eichelberger is also a school-choice advocate. He said that some people view the school choice movement -- encouraging options such as charter schools and school vouchers -- to be a civil rights issue. \n\"The fewest opportunities and the poorest academic experience are in minority neighborhoods,\" he said. \"Why we tolerate that today, I don't know. I'm not going to tolerate it, and as chairman of the Education Committee I'm looking at that issue and trying to find ways to help these kids.\" \nFebruary 20, 2017 — 7:11 PM EST | Updated: February 20, 2017 — 7:13 PM EST We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.
