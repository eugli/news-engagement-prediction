It affects about one in 3,000 babies in Britain. Samantha as a young heart patient \nTetralogy of Fallot patients usually need a second operation to repair their pulmonary valve when adults, but until recently replacement valves were too small for 80 per cent of people. \nMs Blake believed that her heart was beginning to fail two years ago when she felt breathless after climbing stairs or walking up hills. \n“Leaving it wasn’t an option because it would have continued to deteriorate and eventually my heart wouldn’t have worked properly,” she said. \n“My breathing returned to normal immediately after the procedure. I feel lucky to be one of the first people to have the new replacement valve, it’s like a weight has been lifted knowing that the leakage has been stopped.” A new device — called the Venus valve — made from animal heart tissue, is being used in a clinical study at St Thomas’ Hospital and is available in much larger sizes. \nProfessor Qureshi said: “Around 100 people have had the valve implanted in the world and the majority have had good results. This is a very exciting development.” More about: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T15:57:17.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
