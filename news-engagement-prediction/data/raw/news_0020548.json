The chips contain personal information and provide access to the company's IT systems and headquarters, replacing existing ID cards. The controversial devices raise questions about personal security and safety, including whether they may allow the movements of people with implants to be tracked. Scroll down for video Belgian marketing firm NewFusion is offering its staff the chance to replace their existing ID cards with RFID chips implanted under their skin WHAT ARE RFID CHIPS? Radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips are about the same size as a grain of rice. They store personal security information which can be transmitted over short distances to special receivers. They can already be found in contactless cards - including the Oyster system in London. They are also similar to the chips implanted in pets. It is believed there are 10,000 people across the world using microchip technology inside their bodies. NewFusion, a marketing firm in Belgium, is offering the chip to its employees. The radio-frequency identification (RFID) chips are about the same size as a grain of rice and store personal security information which can be transmitted over short distances to special receivers. RFID chips can already be found in contactless cards, including banks cards and the Oyster system which is used by more than 10 million people to pay for public transport in London. They are also similar to the chips implanted in pets. The ones used at NewFusion cost around €100 each (£85 or $106) and are inserted between the thumb and index finger. A growing number of people and businesses are choosing to adopt the practice, known as biohacking.
