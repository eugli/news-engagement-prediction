Her filing does not offer any additional specifics or note if she reported the events to police. It states that no one was present at the time. \nThe order, which was issued Friday, also calls for Brown to surrender any firearms he has until a March 9 hearing on the restraining order. \nAn email message sent to Brown's attorney Mark Geragos was not immediately returned. \nBrown and Tran dated after the singer pleaded guilty to felony assault for an attack on Rihanna in 2009 just hours before the Grammy Awards. \nA judge ended Brown's probation in 2015, after several missteps that included punching a man outside a Washington hotel and stints in rehab. \nThe singer also underwent domestic violence and anger management counseling. \nA facility that treated Brown wrote in a 2014 letter to the judge overseeing his probation in the Rihanna case that the singer was being treated for bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and past substance abuse. \nBrown's career faltered after the Rihanna attack and eventually rebounded and his album F.A.M.E won a Grammy Award in 2012.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:40:24.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
