So sad, so predictable, so when will we learn?” \nIt seems Brazil only decided to splash the cash purely for the Games and images of the aftermath undoubtedly caused a stir on Twitter. \nTokyo will play host to the next Olympic Games when it gets underway in 2020, and by the shocking photos released this week, let’s hope they can learn from Brazil’s mistakes. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
