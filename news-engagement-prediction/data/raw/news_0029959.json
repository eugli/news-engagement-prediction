However, that is all about to change. The Health Ranger is sounding the alarm on the dangers of biosolids, a toxic widely-used fertilizer that has contaminated our food and water supply, in his upcoming documentary “ Biosludged .” \nThe process begins every time you flush your toilet . Raw sewage including human feces and animal fats, which are classified as ‘sewage sludge,’ make their way to you local wastewater treatment plant. The semi-solid organic matter is then biologically and chemically treated with lime to reduce odors and pathogen levels. This new product is then sold to your local municipality as a Biosolid, or as we call it Biosludge. (RELATED: More on the dangers of biosludge is available at Bioterrorism.news ) \nThe Biosludge is then used for fertilizer on local farms or in parks . In the past citizens have complained because of the stench. The EPA admits biosolids have their own distinct smell described as “a slight musty, ammonia odor.” Little do these citizens know the aroma is the least of their worries \nEPA whistleblower and author of the book “Science For Sale” Dr. David Lewis reveals in the film that these biosolids contain every toxic chemical, every heavy metal, and every pollutant that we’re concerned about causing adverse health effects.

According to the Health Ranger, city leaders get financed kick-backs from Biosludge companies to keep the system going. The money combined with false data provided by the EPA is what has allowed this cover up to continue for so long. \nDr. Lewis states, “let any scientist try faking data they would be fired and put in prison. But fake data for the government and its interest and industries interests and you will be promoted and protected at the highest levels.” \nThis should alarm every citizen because according to the EPA all 50 states use Biosludge as fertilizer. That means this deadly, unregulated pollutant is contaminating our golf courses, our children’s’ baseball fields, and our community gardens. \nBiosludge is a very severe problem that if not rectified soon will have a detrimental impact on our health and environment. As the Health Ranger warns, “this generation of humans may leave behind a truly toxic legacy for generations to come.” \n“Biosludged” will be released this year for free as part of the “Censored Science” film series produced by The Health Ranger , Mike Adams. \nSources:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:32:44.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
