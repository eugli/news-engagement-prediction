Oil \nShidok said work on the National Biofuels Policy and Incentive Document was at the final stages and the document is currently awaiting ratification by the Federal Executive Council, adding that once the approval of the council is gotten, the policy would become operational. \nHe stated that once the policy is in place, there are a number of individuals who are already engaged in the farming and production of biofuel products, while the policy would help coordinate and promote integration of their various activities. \nHe maintained that the production of biofuels and biodiesels do not require complex technologies, but only require little equipment and off-takers. \nHe said, “Biofuel as a source of energy when fully adopted would create employment opportunities, support agricultural development and can as well be used to generate electricity. Other benefits of biofuels are environmentally friendly, less pollution, cheaper as well as become source of foreign exchange earner.” \nHe explained that biofuels comprise bioethanol and biodiesel, which are blends of petroleum products and agricultural products. \nAccording to him, bioethanol E-10, for instance is a blend of 90 per cent gasoline and 10 per cent ethanol, while biodiesel B-20 is a blend of 80 per cent diesel and 20 per cent oil jathropha, used palm oil among others.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T01:52:02.136+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
