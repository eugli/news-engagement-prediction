Voices of opposition were relegated to the fringe. \nNow under U.S. President Donald Trump, the conspiracy theorists are back with a vengeance. Part of Fed chair Janet Yellen`s testimony Tuesday to the Senate banking committee was clearly intended to discourage that anti-central bank sentiment. Trump's friends can't borrow \nIt's unclear if her words will be effective. \nMore than once Yellen was asked about Trump's recent statement connecting banking regulation with reduced lending. \nHe said he had personal experience. 'Frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses and they can't borrow money,' said U.S. President Donald Trump. But Yellen says bank lending exceeds the 2008 peak. (Kevin Lamarque/Reuters) \n\"Frankly, I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses and they can't borrow money,\" said Trump on Friday. \nBut yesterday Yellen testified that was not what the evidence showed. In fact, it showed there is no shortage of lending. \n\"Commercial and industrial lending at this point has grown … and exceeds its 2008 peak,\" she testified. \"The same thing is true for total loans held by commercial banks.\" \nIn the last 12 months, large commercial loans were up seven per cent and small business loans were up four per cent, she said. Forced to hoard? \nOf course, Trump is far from the sole voice in his administration finding fault with the central bank and its policy. \nYellen was asked by Senator Elizabeth Warren to reflect on a statement by Trump's chief economic adviser, Gary Cohn, about lending reserve requirements enforced by the Fed. \n\"Banks are forced to hoard capital, and they can't take any risk,\" Cohn declared. \"We need to get banks back into the lending business.\" Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic adviser, has said the central bank is forcing lenders to hoard money instead of lending it. Yellen refuted that statement. (Andrew Kelly/Reuters) \nAs Yellen patiently explained, Cohn's statement reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of the banking system. \n\"It's not a requirement that they take that money and stick it in a safe where it can't be used,\" Yellen responded. \"It's a requirement that they finance the lending that they want to do with a certain amount of capital and not only with debt.\" \nRather than being weak and struggling due to the effects of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation of 2010, as Cohn recently declared, there is evidence that U.S. banks are strong and are \"capturing market share from European banks,\" Yellen said. \nIn fact, evidence shows that banks of all sizes are more profitable than ever . Books no longer needed \nIt used to be that the wackiest views on the Fed were limited to a small cluster of book-reading fanatics. \nThe Federal Reserve Conspiracy by Antony Sutton and The Secrets of the Federal Reserve by the anti-Semitic Eustace Mullins describe a complex financial world manipulated by elites, usually Jews, for their own advantage. \nBut you no longer have to read a book to encounter such views. Many similar sentiments circulate on the web and on Twitter, often from people who seem to support Trump. \nTirades against \"fiat currency\" — money not backed by a physical object such as a precious metal — and in favour of \"sound money\" seem to imply a dream of returning to the gold standard, which Trump addressed with approval during the campaign as something that would be \"hard\" but \"wonderful.\" \nIn nervous times, scare stories about the dangers of a weak and malicious Federal Reserve may be used by some promoting investments in gold or silver.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T12:04:17.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
