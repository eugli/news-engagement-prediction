Among the victims is father-of-two Boubaker Thabti, of Tunisian descent, halal butcher and father-of-three Azzedine Soufiane, who worked next door to fellow victim Khaled Belkacemi, an Algerian-Canadian professor. The professor, who was also married with children, worked at the same university where Bissonnette is enrolled. The mass shooting, which was rare for Canada and which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned as terrorism, prompted an outpouring of support for the mosque and for Canada's one million Muslims in the country of about 35 million Pictures show blood on the walls and what looks like holes from gun shots near the entrance to the mosque Police nhave declined to discuss a motive for the shooting, but friends and online acquaintances told Canadian media that Bissonnette had expressed anti-immigration sentiments, especially toward Muslim refugees Those injured during the shooting mainly had gunshots to the abdomen, but also to the neck, shoulders and legs. Doctors removed an average of three to six bullets per shooting victim, said surgeon Julien Clement Blood could be seen in the carpets at the mosque as police continued to examine the scene of the shooting last night The two patients with the most serious injuries 'are expected to survive, but it's too early for a long-term prognosis,' a surgeon revealed The mosque's concierge Ibrahima Barry, 39, and his cousin Mamadou Tanou Barry, 42, both of Guinea, were also killed, according to Associated Press. Abdelkrim Hassen, a married father-of-three who worked in IT for the government was also gunned down and killed, according to his friend Ali Hamadi who had also been at the mosque but left shortly before the shooting. Meanwhile, it has also emerged that a father-of-four is among those injured in the shooting rampage. Taxi driver Saïd El-Amari, 38, is said to be in a critical condition at the Enfant-Jésus hospital. His brother-in-law, Hassan Dardari, told Le Journal de Quebec: 'There are other operations to come. He is in a critical state.' At a press conference on Monday afternoon, officials from the Gendarmerie royale du Canada confirmed the suspect had been charged with six counts of murder. Searches are ongoing at the suspect's home and at the mosque, they said. It's likely he will have more charges, specifically under the terrorism act, brought against him. Bissonnette fled the scene in his Mitsubishi but called 911 himself later to turn himself in, local media reported. His car was spotted on the side of the road with a police vehicle behind it on Sunday night Bissonnette is a student at Laval University. A friend of Bissonnette's said he was pro-Trump and conservative but did not think he was capable of violence The 27-year-old was dressed in a white prison jumpsuit and sneakers and appeared to be handcuffed as he made his way inside the courthouse Alexandre Bissonnette's house in Quebec City, Canada, (pictured) was searched by police after the shooting Bissonnette, 27, and el Khadir were arrested on Sunday night after six men were shot dead at the Quebec City Islamic Cultural Center during evening prayers. El Khadir was picked up by police at the mosque but Bissonnette fled in his Mitsubishi and was arrested in nearby Ile d'Orleans around 20 minutes later after calling 911, Le Soleil reports. Police found two rifles and an AK-47 in the car. Court clerk Isabelle Ferland earlier identified the pair as the two men arrested in connection with the shooting. Police are not seeking anyone else in connection with the attack which was is being treated as an act of terror. A source later told Reuters police were looking at Bissonnette as a 'lone wolf'. The political sciences and anthropology student, who is from the affluent Quebec City suburb Cap-Rouge, will appear in court sometime on Monday or Tuesday. Bissonnette is suspected of carrying out the Quebec City mosque massacre alone Students described him to DailyMail.com as a pro-Trump loner but a timid man who didn't seem capable of committing an act of terror. 'Based on the conversations that I had with him during the American presidential campaign, it's true he is pro-Trump,' the student, who asked to remain anonymous, said. He added that he Bissonnette had 'never demonstrated' a violent side but that he didn't 'fit in' among peers. 'Yes, he was conservative in the political sense but despite the profound differences between us, he never showed or suggested that political violence or terrorism was something he was capable of. 'He didn't fit in well at university.' One Facebook group dedicated to welcoming refugees in the Quebec City area claimed that Bissonnette was well known in the area for his 'pro-Le Pen and anti-feminist positions at Laval University and on social networks,' wrote the Bienvenue aux réfugié.es - Ville de Québec Facebook group. He is said to have acted like a 'troll' and would attack women's rights. A Facebook page reportedly belonging to Bissonnette, which has since been taken down, revealed support for far right ideologies, including that of Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's National Front. For Le Pen and her supporters, 'massive migration,' notably from Muslim North Africa, is supplanting French civilization and is at the root of many France's modern woes. 'On est chez nous' ('We're in our land') is a mantra at the rallies of her party, the National Front. Her views have won the endorsement from white supremacists. Other 'likes' included Israeli Defense Forces, Donald Trump, and outspoken critics of Islam Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. Yet neighbors paint a very different picture of the suspect, describing him as the 'perfect boy-next-door', who loved his family, sports and would always remember to say hello. Alain Dufour, a financier who retired last week, and has lived next door to Bissonnette's family home since the alleged shooter was a child, said: ' Alexandre is a very nice, friendly young man. He and his brother have been brought up very closely and carefully by his parents. They are all very close. 'Alexandre has never given anybody any trouble in this area and is the perfect boy next door. 'He is friendly and always says hello. I didn't know that their son had a gun and never imagined he could kill innocent people like that. 'My wife Huguette and I are very upset about those people who were killed. Very sad.
