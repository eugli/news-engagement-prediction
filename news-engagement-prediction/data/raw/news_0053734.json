It's going to be interesting this year. I've been helping the team build my own bikes.\" \nBennetts Suzuki team manager Hicken added: \"We've known Michael for a long time and always wanted to work with him again this year, so we're really pleased we've been able to put a deal together. \n\"We've made good progress already with the development of the new GSX-R1000, and we know the potential is there with the bike, especially with a proven winner like Michael on board.\" \nThe Hawk-backed Suzuki outfit will also compete in the British Superbike Championship, with former World Superbike champion Sylvain Guintoli and reigning British Superstock 1000cc champion Taylor Mackenzie their chosen riders.
