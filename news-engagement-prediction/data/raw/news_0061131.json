By Greg E. Matheison, Sr./Rex/Shutterstock. Before an energized crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday, Mike Pence boldly proclaimed that after seven years of futile attempts to dismantle President Barack Obama’s signature health-care law, the G.O.P. is the on cusp of finally repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. “Let me assure you,” the vice president asserted, “America’s Obamacare nightmare is about to end.” The timing for the White House, and the Republican Party more broadly, isn’t ideal. With Obama out of office, the Affordable Care Act is more popular than its been in nearly seven years. Thousands of worried constituents, not all of them Democrats, have been flooding Republican town halls across the country to ask pointed questions about the G.O.P. replacement plan, which has remained largely shrouded in mystery. Or it was, anyway, until Friday when a Politico published a leaked draft of a House Republican repeal bill that provides a blueprint of the G.O.P.’s plan to remake the $3 trillion health-care industry. Unsurprisingly, the draft guts the meat of the Affordable Care Act. Namely, it scraps the individual mandate, the federal subsidies to help low-income individuals afford care, and the Obamacare taxes—all of which conservatives have railed against for years. In place of Obamacare’s subsidies, which are based on income, Politico reports that the Republican plan would provide tax credits based upon age. It also includes a cap on tax breaks for high-end workplace health-care plans—the impact of which is similar to the much derided “Cadillac tax” under Obama’s plan. In lieu of the unpopular individual mandate, people who don’t maintain continuous coverage would be forced to pay up to 30 percent higher premiums for one year. Without the individual mandate, the insured rate in the United States is likely to drop, an outcome that Republican Rep. Michael Burgess said would be a positive sign. “We’re not going to send an I.R.S. agent out to chase you down and make you buy health insurance,” Burgess, who serves as head of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health, told Bloomberg. “If the numbers drop, I would say that’s a good thing, because we’ve restored personal liberty in this country.” That’s a far cry from Donald Trump’s previous promise to provide “insurance for everybody.” Most significantly, the G.O.P. draft bill would roll back the Medicaid expansion under the A.C.A. in 2020—an aspect of the law the White House has, in the past, advocated to keep. Under the plan, states that want to keep the program will be able to, but the federal funding would be drastically curtailed and it would be in the form of block grants based on the number of Medicaid enrollees. Contrary to Trump’s claim at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday that Obamacare “covers very few people,” roughly 20 million people have gained health insurance through the program since its inception—12 million of them through the expanded Medicaid program, Bloomberg reports. In states where the expansion is rolled back, millions of low-income people could lose coverage. As a result of this, a number of Republican senators and governors have argued in favor of keeping the Medicaid expansion—a point of contention that could potentially derail the repeal process. One senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told state lawmakers on Wednesday that she “will not support a reckless repeal process” of Obamacare that curtails the program as long as her state wants to keep it. But Rep. Dennis Ross of Florida, who serves on the House Republicans vote-counting team, dismissed insurance for everyone as unrealistic in an interview with Bloomberg. “Not everybody is going to have health care—some people just don’t care enough about their own care,” Ross said, suggesting that the best Republicans can do is provide “universal access” to health care. “Whether they take it or not is like trying to legislate responsibility.” Another glaring red flag in the Republican bill is how it addresses the issue of high-risk patients. Arguably the most popular aspect of the Affordable Care Act—and one that Trump has pledged to keep— is the provision that bars insurance companies from refusing coverage to individuals with pre-existing conditions. Since the G.O.P. has begun to take steps toward dismantling Obamacare, the chief concern expressed by voters is that this protection will be lost in the transition. Politico reports that the Republican plan includes $100 billion in block grants to the states, to be used to supplement insurance costs for expensive enrollees—such as those with pre-existing conditions. But as the outlet notes, this solution falls far short of the protections under the A.C.A. Of course, this is just one of the many Obamacare repeal drafts floating around Washington. But after seven years of deriding Obama’s sprawling health-care law, Republicans on Capitol Hill have seemingly awoken to the reality that any missteps could prove calamitous at the ballot box. And with public support for the law at an all-time high, the risks have never been higher. For his part, former Speaker of the House John Boehner doesn’t think a full repeal and replace is going to happen. “Republicans never ever agree on health care,” he said on Thursday.
