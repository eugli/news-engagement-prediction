Prior to that, he canceled two Las Vegas shows in late January but returned for the last three in early February. \nThe singer-songwriter is set to release a new album this spring called “God’s Problem Child.” He won a Grammy over the weekend for best traditional pop vocal album with “Summertime: Willie Nelson Sings Gershwin.” \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
