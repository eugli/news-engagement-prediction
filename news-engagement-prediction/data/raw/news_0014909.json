Cpl Elise Bowden \nOfficers from the Arlington Police Department along with hospital staff and family formed a wall of honor as Cpl. Bowden was wheeled out of John Peter Smith hospital. She was met with cheers and applause. \nThe 14-year police veteran has several broken bones and a lengthy recovery ahead of her, but those who visited her are feeling good about her progress. \nThe driver, 23-year-old Tavis Crane, who ran over Cpl. Bowden was shot and killed by another officer. He had a felony warrant for evading arrest in Dallas County as well as misdemeanor warrants from Grand Prairie. \nThere’s been a call for Arlington police to release dash-cam video of the officer-involved shooting , but police say the policy is to not release video during an open investigation. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
