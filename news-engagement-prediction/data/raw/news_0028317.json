Gen. Joseph Kellogg, Jr. and former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus. \nPresident Trump’s embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned Monday night and three names have emerged as possible replacements. \nVice Adm. Bob Harward is one name that has come up to replace Flynn as national security adviser, and the leading candidate to get the job, a senior official told Fox News. \nHarward is a U.S. Navy SEAL, but also has a previous relationship with Secretary of Defense James Mattis. Harward was the deputy commander of the U.S. Central Command under Mattis and was also the deputy commander of U.S. Joint Forces Command. \nTRUMP’S NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER MICHAEL FLYNN RESIGNS \nWhite House sources described Harward as the “toughest guy in the SEALs” and a “real rock.” \nLt. Gen. Joseph Keith Kellogg, Jr. has been floated as a permanent replacement for Flynn. Trump named him the acting national security adviser after Flynn resigned. \nKellogg is a decorated U.S. Army veteran , having served from 1967 to 2003. He earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star with “V” device and the Air Medal with “V” device during his time in the Vietnam War. \nPrior to Kellogg’s retirement, he was the Director of the Command, Control, Communications and Computers Directorate under the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \nANother name floated as a possible replacement for Flynn is retired Gen. David Petraeus. \nTrump routinely dropped Petraeus’ name during his election campaign. Trump said that Petraeus was punished more severely for leaking classified documents to his mistress than Hillary Clinton was punished for setting up a private email server during his time as Secretary of State. \nREAD: MICHAEL FLYNN’S LETTER OF RESIGNATION AS NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER \nPetraeus was briefly considered for the secretary of state job, but was passed up because of his rocky tenure as CIA chief and the possibility that he wouldn’t be confirmed in the Senate because of those issues. \nAccording to the Washington Examiner , George W. Bush’s former national security adviser Stephen Hadley and Tom Bossert, a former national security aide under Bush have been considered a Flynn’s replacement. The paper added that Adm. James Stavridis, a dean at Tufts University, is also on the table. \nFox News’ John Roberts contributed to this report.
