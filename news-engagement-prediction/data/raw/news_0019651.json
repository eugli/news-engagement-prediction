It’s like how European or African peoples would send sonic signals from village to village via drum, or how wolves howl at the moon. Make a big enough splash, and the percussion speaks for itself.\nRelated Stories Crows Continue to Be Terrifyingly Intelligent Octopuses Are ‘the Closest We Will Come to Meeting an Intelligent Alien’ As noted in the marine-life publication Hakai magazine, University of Queensland marine biologist Ailbhe S. Kavanagh and colleagues observed 76 humpback groups off the coast of Australia for 200 hours between 2010 and 2011. They found that breaching is way more common when pods are at least 2.5 miles apart, with fin- or fluke-slapping deployed when fellow whales are nearby.\nThe breaching probably carries better than whales’ signature songs : “They’re potentially using [these behaviors] when background noise levels are higher,” Kavanagh tells Hakai , “as the acoustic signal possibly travels better than a vocal signal would.” Given that whale songs have regional accents , you have to wonder if their aerial gymnastics have a certain patois, too.", "external_links": ["http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mms.12374/full", "https://www.hakaimagazine.com/article-short/why-whales-leap-air", "https://www.omahaschoolofmusicanddance.com/5-ways-drums-are-used-to-communicate/"], "published": "2017-02-07T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T01:53:22.898+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
