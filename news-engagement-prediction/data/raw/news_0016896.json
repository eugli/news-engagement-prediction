The reclassification of broadband into a utilitylike service akin to telephones and electricity provided the legal foundation of net neutrality rules. Mr. Pai said he had not decided how he would approach the overhaul of broadband classification and net neutrality rules, but he faces legal hurdles. A federal court upheld the rules last year and the commission could end up in a lengthy legal battle if he tried to scrap the rules. Mr. Pai will have the help of powerful members of Congress, who have promised to attack the classification of broadband as a utilitylike service. And he is popular among Republican leaders, including the Senate’s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who with other members viewed Mr. Pai as a loyal voice of dissent during the Obama years. At 44 and the child of immigrants from India who settled in Kansas, Mr. Pai is a fresh face for the Republican Party. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Congress could introduce legislation that limits the agency’s ability to regulate broadband providers and enforce net neutrality rules. Also under attack are privacy rules for broadband providers. In his first days, Mr. Pai scrapped a proposal to break open the cable box market. “The agency has strayed from its core mission,” said Marsha Blackburn, a Republican representative from Tennessee who oversees a telecommunications and tech subcommittee. She has called for hearing within two weeks of F.C.C. leaders on the agency’s agenda in the new administration. Democrats in Congress said they would fight legislation that will water down net neutrality rules. They said Mr. Pai, described as a straight-A student of telecom law, will be a tough adversary. They face great opposition by Republicans who have promised to prioritize the overturn of net neutrality. “The key here is that its already been tested in the courts and the court upheld this,” said Anna G. Eshoo, a Democratic representative from California. “Ajit Pai is intelligent and genial, but he is not on the side of consumers and the public interest.” Most troubling to consumer advocates was the secrecy around Mr. Pai’s early actions. The F.C.C. chairman criticized his predecessor for passing “midnight” rules without consulting other commissioners. That includes a decision to rescind the permissions of nine broadband providers to participate in a federal subsidy plan for low-income consumers. None of the providers currently serve low-income consumers, but Mr. Pai’s comments could portend a shake-up of the Lifeline low-income subsidy program. On Monday, the F.C.C. is scheduled to appear before a federal court to defend its push to put a lid on extraordinarily expensive phone call prices from prison. But it told a judge a few days ago that Mr. Pai did not believe in the case. It’s lawyer will be there, but the F.C.C. gave up much of its time in court to an outside public advocacy lawyer, Andrew Schwartzman, who has pushed for the price caps. Mignon Clyburn , the sole Democrat on the F.C.C., warned that the actions would directly harm consumers. “Rather than working to close the digital divide, this action widens the gap,” Ms. Clyburn said.
