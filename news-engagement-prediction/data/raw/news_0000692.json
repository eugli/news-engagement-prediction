The controversial author said the left protests against him because they “are terrified of anyone that might be persuasive, might be interesting and might take people with them.” \nExplaining that he was not nearly the monster he is portrayed to be and that he’s instead a “libertarian, gay, Trump-supporting provocateur,” Yiannopoulos went on to brag about how he’s the hottest ticket at colleges. \nCarlson took the conversation into a more philosophical direction, noting that Milo’s speech was squelched due to violence and wanting to know how he felt about the irony of being called a Nazi by those utilizing violence to silence him. \n“The left is profoundly antithetical to free speech these days, does not want to hear alternative points of view, and will do anything to shut it down,” Yiannopoulos responded. “My point is being proven over and over and over again.” \nWatch the entire interview above, via Fox News. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T10:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:59:52.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
