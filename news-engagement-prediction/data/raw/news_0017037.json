At age 63, Christie Brinkley can still make a splash at the beach. \nThe model returned to the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in a photo shoot with her daughters, Alexa Ray Joel, 31, and Sailor Brinkley Cook, 18. \nIn a shot released Monday, the three pose together in black bathing suits. A photo posted by Sports Illustrated Swimsuit (@si_swimsuit) on Feb 6, 2017 at 5:51pm PST \nBrinkley graced the Swimsuit Issue cover in 1979, 1980 and 1981 and has appeared in the magazine eight times overall ― the last time coming in 2004. \nWhen Sports Illustrated approached her about another go-round, Brinkley balked. \n“My first thought was, ‘ At my age? No way !’” she told People. “When I turned 30, I was like, ‘This is the last time I’m posing in a bathing suit!’ When this issue comes out, I’ll be 63. I thought, ‘Those days are over.’ But to get to do it with my girls, I thought, ‘One last go!’” \nBrinkley said a comeback in the iconic issue stirred up old feelings. “ I can get very emotional about this ,” she told Sports Illustrated. “How many years ago, I was that insecure girl hoping that I would be good enough for the magazine. So to see my daughters now having the same thoughts I had, and to be able to see them actually be there on the job, was definitely a big moment.” \nFor more shots of Brinkley and family, visit Sports Illustrated . The 2017 Swimsuit Issue comes out on newsstands Feb.15.
