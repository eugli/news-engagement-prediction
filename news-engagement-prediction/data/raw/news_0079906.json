The Pelicans had just formulated the most intimidating frontcourt duo in the NBA, had rejuvenated ambition, and all while the eight-year veteran was having arguably the best stretch of basketball in his career. \nHoliday was putting up elite point guard numbers in the 15 games prior to the All-Star break, averaging 20.7 points, 8.1 assists, 5 rebounds and 2.3 steals while shooting 53.9 percent from the field and 43.4 percent from deep. \nThis level of play even inspired some whispers of a Pelicans “Big 3” when they acquired DeMarcus Cousins on February 19th. You expected the addition of Cousins to benefit Jrue’s efficiency and assist totals, while easing some of his offensive workload. \nMORE: Pelicans' future looks bright after trade for Cousins \nFlash forward a week and New Orleans has lost all three games with Boogie by an average of 17 points, as Holiday has posted a stomach-turning 10 points, 6 assists and 5.3 turnovers per game while shooting 28.9 percent from the field. \nCousins and Anthony Davis have gotten theirs during this three-game stretch, combining for 29.3 points and 11.5 rebounds, so it’s easy to point the blame in the direction of the team’s primary ball-handler. \nGame one against Houston set the tone, as Holiday finished 3-of-12 (0-of-6 from three) with 6 points, 4 assists and 7 turnovers. He looked lost and tentative on offense, forcing passes into the hands of Rockets defenders. The Pelicans averaged a microscopic 44 points per 100 possessions while he was on the floor in this game, 24 points less than any other New Orleans player. \nThe next two contests weren’t much prettier, but you could still easily dismiss this all as a rogue rough patch and chalk part of it up to assimilating a new teammate. \nBut then you watch this. A post shared by Sports Videos (@houseofhighlights) on Feb 26, 2017 at 6:31pm PST \nEasily overshadowed by the vicious dunk in this clip is the All-Star-Game-caliber defense that Holiday plays on Westbrook, giving him an unobstructed path to an annihilation of Jrue’s prized new teammate. Jrue barely moves. Take a look at other highlights from this game and you’ll find Holiday loafing around listlessly on a number of defensive plays similar to this. \nThis is startling for a player who comes with a strong defensive reputation, and considering the Pelicans defense is 4.2 points better per 100 possessions with Holiday on the court this season. \nYou don’t want to overreact to three games, but something doesn’t seem right. Jrue has the look of a guy who hasn’t yet returned from the break, rather than one galvanized by his team’s acquisition of another superstar. \nSo what is actually going on? Is he overly flustered by the nearly impossible burden of pleasing two bigs who thrive with the ball in their hands, and aren’t really accustomed to playing any other way? \nLooking at a very small three-game sample size (alert!), it does suggest the early load has been placed squarely on Holiday’s shoulders to make this thing work. Despite adding Cousins’ second-ranked 37.2 usage percentage, Holiday’s touches are up 11 percent with Boogie, his average time per touch is up 13 percent and his overall time of possession is up 25 percent. Only two NBA players have touched the ball more than Holiday since the break, and that’s while his shots per game and assists are both down. \nThis smells of “here’s the ball Jrue, figure out how to make these two beasts happy.” Two beasts who each rank top 10 in the league in usage percentage, pick and roll scoring, post-up scoring. Good luck with that. \nMORE: Trade to Pelicans has major impact on DeMarcus Cousins' money \nAnother consideration is that we’re looking at a guy who is mentally and physically drained. \nThis is a historically injury-prone player who has strung together 36 consecutive games and already has his most starts in a season since 2012-13. His minutes per game are up 16 percent from last year. Throw in the not-so-insignificant fact that Holiday missed the first three weeks of 2016-17 to be with his wife as she recovered from brain surgery with a newborn baby , and it’s easy to paint a picture of an exhausted man. \nHead coach Alvin Gentry might need to ease up on Holiday’s playing time for a week or two and rely on backup Tim Frazier, who was strong during Holiday’s absence in early November. Let Jrue get some legs back. \nBut whatever the answer is, the Pelicans will need their 26-year-old point guard to revive himself soon for all this newfound hope to materialize into a playoff berth.
