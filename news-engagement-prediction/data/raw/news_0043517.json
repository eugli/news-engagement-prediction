Baylor junior day — Baylor junior was a huge success as the Bears landed their first two commits of the 2018 cycle (more on them in a bit) and made an impact on a number of in-state targets. Some important recruits that made their way down to Waco were five-star cornerback Anthony Cook , four-star quarterback Jalen Mayden and four-star wide receiver Al’vonte Woodard . The day resulted in offers to Houston Lamar defensive tackle Joshua Landry , San Antonio Clark tight end Ben Sims and Bryan offensive linemen Ylijaah Hall . Matt Rhule and his staff are doing an incredible job considering the circumstances. \n2. Oklahoma junior day — OU junior day actually takes place on Sunday, but the visitors list is absolutely loaded. Some big-time Texas prospects will be in attendance, including four-star safety Leon O’Neal Jr. , four-star defensive tackle Calvin Avery , four-star running back Keaontay Ingram , four-star cornerback Jalen Green and four-star wide receiver Brennan Eagles . The Sooners are squarely in the mix with all these targets, and it wouldn’t be surprising to see them come away with a commit or two tomorrow. \n3. SMU junior day — SMU junior day did not result in any commitments, but the Mustangs did send out offers to two in-state wide receivers — four-star Keller Timber Creek product Erik Ezukanma and Clear Brook’s Mark Milton . Ezukanma will be tough for the Ponies to land, but he could be a dangerous weapon in Chad Morris’ offense. Milton currently holds offers from SMU, Bowling Green and Houston. The Mustangs also played host to quarterback commit William Brown , Dallas Madison wide receiver Antonio Gage and Arlington Oak Ridge tight end Christoph Henle . \nCommits \n*** Southlake Carroll offensive lineman Jackson Kimble became the first commit in Baylor’s 2018 class. Kimble chose the Bears over offers from Bowling Green and Texas Tech. While his offer list isn’t lengthy, Kimble, a three-star prospect, is one of the most underrated offensive linemen in state and is a great pull for the Bears. He has some work to do on his frame, but he has excellent technique. \n*** Just eight minutes after landing Kimble, the Bears picked up a verbal commitment from Cedar Hill athlete Joshua Fleeks . Ex-Cedar Hill head coach and first-year Baylor assistant Joey McGuire played a huge role in getting Fleeks on board and will continue to make his presence felt in South Dallas. Fleeks is a jack-of-all trades that can lineup at multiple positions on the offensive side of the ball. \n*** Louisiana Lafayette dipped down in the Lone Star State and came away with its quarterback of the future in New Caney signal-caller Jordan Cooper . The three-star prospect had a great junior year as he did damage with both his arm and his legs. He finished with 2,172 yards passing, 1,063 yards rushing and 32 total touchdowns. \nCrystal Ball Trending \nCB D’shawn Jamison , Houston Lamar — Texas holds 100 percent of the crystal ball predictions with six coming in the last week. The four-star cornerback will make an unofficial visit to UT this Sunday, which means Tom Herman will have an opportunity to come away with his first 2018 pledge. \nDE Joseph Ossai , Conroe Oak Ridge — Texas A&M appears to be the clear-cut front runner in the race for this rising defensive end. The Aggies have had half a dozen crystal ball predictions come in over the last week. Ossai called Texas A&M his dream offer and plans to make a visit in the near future. \nProspect of the week \nIt was another big week for rising Schertz Clemens wide receiver Tommy Bush . The three-star prospect has gone from prospect with potential to one of the most coveted wide receivers in the country. This week alone, he notched offers from Arizona State, Auburn, Georgia, Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Tennessee and others. Check out film of the big wide out. \nProspect to know \nWest Mesquite safety Dayven Coleman has been on my radar since last year when he had no offers at Dallas Skyline. Now, he is quickly moving up recruiting boards thanks to his length and athleticism. Coleman was my Alpha Dog at this week’s True Buzz Showcase and earned his first P5 offer from Colorado a day later.
