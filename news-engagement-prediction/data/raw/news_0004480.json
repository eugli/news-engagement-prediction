Though Reddit didn't specify whose information was being shared, it is believed it was that of a protestor who punched a white nationalist during a TV interview at Trump's inauguration, says the Guardian . Comcast’s anti-Trump walkout ushers in the era of Slacktivism Here's an interest ing sidelight in Bill y Penn 's coverage of the big walkout of Comcast employees to protest the Trump administration's ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries: The Comcast staffers, who work at one of Slack 's biggest customers, organized their protest in a Slack channel . As Billy Penn 's Anna Orso reports: \nComcast employees in at least four cities self-organized the protest through an internal Slack channel that Comcast organizers told Billy Penn grew from about 100 people to 1,200 people this week. Comcast is one of the largest employers in the Philadelphia region and stands as the most influential corporation in the city. Sure, it would have been possible to coordinate such a massive act of social activism in the era before modern collaboration tools—but Slack, though not designed with that particular purpose in mind, must have been a near-ideal venue. comcast Seize the day!

Send Here’s how Snap stacks up against arch-rival Facebook (and Instagram) \nIt will be awfully hard for Snap Inc.'s Snapchat to ever beat Facebook when it comes to scale. Facebook-owned Instagram , just one piece of Mark Zuckerberg's global empire, boasts 400 million daily active users. Snap, in contrast, has just 158 million daily active users—and indicated in its IPO prospectus that user growth may slow in the year ahead . \nBut what Snap lacks in quantity, it makes up in quality —or at least that is the argument that the company wants Madison Avenue to hear. Users younger than 25 are spending over 30 minutes on Snapchat every day, and users over 25 are spending 20 minutes on average. All users, on average, visit 18 times per day. That depth of engagement, Snap suggests, should be extremely valuable to advertisers. \nOf course, if that level of engagement were to drop, Snapchat could start to look remarkably like a different social media company that was once an IPO darling—Twitter.
