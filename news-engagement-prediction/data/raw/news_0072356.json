By Marina Fang \nSen. Ted Cruz on Thursday predicted that President Donald Trump will get another chance to nominate a conservative Supreme Court justice as soon as “this summer.” \nSpeaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference , an annual gathering of conservatives, the Texas Republican did not specify the circumstances. \n“I think we’ll have another Supreme Court vacancy this summer,” Cruz said. \n“If that happens, as much as the left is crazy now, they will go full Armageddon meltdown,” he said. MIKE THEILER via Getty Images Ted Cruz is musing about the fate of one of the Supreme Court justices. \nDespite their ages, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83; Anthony Kennedy, 80 and Stephen Breyer, 78; have given no indication that they will retire any time soon. Last year, there were rumors that conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas would retire , but his wife quickly dismissed them as “bogus.” \nCruz’s office did not return a request for clarification. \nRepublicans held open the seat of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia for more than a year. Senate GOP leaders refused to hold hearings on former President Barack Obama’s nominee Merrick Garland because they wanted to wait for a Republican president to nominate a conservative justice. \nIn January, Trump nominated conservative Judge Neil Gorsuch to the seat. His confirmation hearings will begin on March 20. \nCruz on Thursday described Democratic opposition to Trump as “bat-crap crazy.” \n“The anger on the left, I’ve never seen anything like this. They’re right now opposing everything. Democrats are filibustering everything. The Cabinet is still not confirmed,” he said. “There’s a technical term for their base.” \nWhen moderator Mark Levin, a conservative radio host, suggested “Moscow” for the Democrats’ base, Cruz offered another suggestion. \n“I was going a different direction, which was ‘bat-crap crazy,’” he said.
