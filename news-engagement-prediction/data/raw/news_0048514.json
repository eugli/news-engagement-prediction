Now, in a Korean-language blog post, LG has given us details about the device's cameras, which include a wide-angle dual camera system on the rear, similar to last year's LG V20. Unlike the V20, however, the two rear cameras will use the same kind of sensor, providing the ability to take photos with a 125-degree angle, which is similar to a human's natural field of view. The cameras will also take advantage of the G6's 18:9 \"FullVision\" display, letting users compare their current shot with the last one when taking a square photo. Other built-in shooting modes will include a 360-degree panorama mode, a food mode, as well as an upgraded selfie mode. The latter will take advantage of the front shooter's wide-angle lens, which has a 100-degree field of view. Despite all the information we have about it, the LG G6, surprisingly, hasn't yet been formally announced – this has been confirmed to happen in a press conference on February 26 at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona . As for the event itself, we have a full roundup of what to expect , and will also be covering it live, giving you all the info about the best upcoming devices.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T15:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T10:48:02.282+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
