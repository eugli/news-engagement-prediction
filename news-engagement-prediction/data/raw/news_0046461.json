I see Pres. Trump expressing his opinion.\" pic.twitter.com/QXtJbXWvxD \n— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) February 19, 2017 \nSenator Rand Paul reacted to President Trump ‘s tweet about the press being the “enemy” today by saying he’s not too concerned so long as there’s no legislation in the works to “limit the press.” \nABC’s Jon Karl asked him if he has concerns about the tweet. Paul said it’s certainly not something he would have said, but he does agree that there’s serious media bias issues out there. \nKarl brought up John McCain saying yesterday that attacking and cracking down on the press is how dictatorships start . \nPaul took some shots at McCain on foreign policy before saying, “I haven’t seen any legislation coming forward that wants to limit the press. I see President Trump expressing his opinion, rather forceful in his own distinct way, but I see no evidence that anybody is putting forward any kind of legislation to limit the press.” \nHe went right back to McCain and said that criticisms of Trump are “colored by his own personal dispute” with the president. \nYou can watch a clip of his remarks above, via ABC. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T17:31:41.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
