Provided The new bar opening in the former Mynt Martini space on Cincinnati's Fountain Square is meant to be the alter ego to that longtime venue. Mynt Martini at 28 Fountain Square closed its doors for remodeling and rebranding on Jan. 29. On the weekend of March 10, it will reopen as Jekyll. Jekyll, going into the former Mynt space on Fountain Square, will be that bar's alter ego. Provided \"Jekyll is the alter ego of Mynt,\" owner Mike Mercer told me. \"Forget what you knew about Mynt or saw in Mynt because we are coming out with something completely new.\" The Jekyll logo shares a \"y\" in common with Mynt, but the similarities end there. The space is undergoing a top-to-bottom remodel with completely new decor and a new vibe. Mercer described it as modern with an industrial rustic feel. The new space will be warmer and inviting and house 20 70-inch TVs, while the outdoor patio space will have a backyard feel. All of the dining tables are being made by Jimmy Gibson , the former Cincinnati chef who left the kitchen to pursue woodworking . Gibson is also consulting on the menu for Jekyll, which Mercer describes as \"American-sized tapas.\" \"We've got a book 10 pages deep of ideas, so now it's a matter of tasting,\" Mercer said. \"The concept is going to be pushed toward community and being in a group and being able to share with friends. You can get a meal for yourself or four or five to share with friends.\" In that same vein of community and sharing, a signature aspect of the bar will be shareable cocktails. The bar is branding its happy hour as \"Jekyll Hour\" and is offering shareable punch bowls and whiskey barrels of cocktails up to 128 ounces. \"It's something nobody else in town is doing,\" Mercer said. Brownfield covers retail and restaurants, technology, manufacturing and courts.
