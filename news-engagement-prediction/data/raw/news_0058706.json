The only problem? It arrives at 5:00 a.m. and that’s too early to check into most hotels. No need to nap at the gate, though—you have options. Book a Hotel With Early Check-In \nThe easiest way to deal with the check-in problem is to eliminate it in the first place. Some hotels are strict about their rules, but others will work with you, depending on when you arrive. If you’re only going to be a couple of hours early, many hotels will accommodate. And the earlier you let them know, the easier it is for them to make room for your request. Advertisement \nOthers have “early check-in” policies. You’ll pay extra, but it’s typically a better deal than just booking an extra day. As USA Today points out , some hotels might only charge half of the standard nightly rate for these rooms. As You Stay is a free app that helps you find these rates, too. You plug in your travel dates and time frame, and the app finds hotels based on your specific availability . \nIf checking in early isn’t a solution, though, you might have to find a way to kill time. While you do, you probably want to ditch your bags. If your hotel won’t let you check in early, chances are, they’ll at least store your bags for you. If you kill time at the airport, some airports have lockers to store your stuff, and many tourist destinations do, too. iOS/Android: Most hotels have standard check-in and check-out times. These hours can be frustrating … Read more Read more Buy an Airport Lounge Day Pass \nAirports offer a lot of amenities these days, so killing time doesn’t have to mean hanging out at a Cinnabon for hours on end. Advertisement \nDepending on the airport, you may be able to book a day pass at an airport lounge. Travel site View From the Wing says that rules vary quite a bit, but if you have a membership, chances are, the lounge will grant you access even if you’re arriving, not departing. If you don’t have a membership, use a site like Lounge Pass to look up day pass rates and availability at different airports around the world. Airfare Watchdog also has a list of lounges in popular airports here. \nRates are usually between $25-$50 and free amenities usually include TV, Wi-Fi, charging stations, food, and booze. JFK’s Airspace Lounge , for example, is $25 for the day and not only includes free snacks, coffee, and Wi-Fi, but also access to their showers. Other lounges may have beds and spas that you can book for a little extra. No, fifty bucks isn’t cheap, but it’s probably cheaper than booking an extra day for a hotel room you’re not going to use.
