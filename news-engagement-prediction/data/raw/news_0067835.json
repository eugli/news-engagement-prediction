Brits are ditching their polite reputation to become excellent at haggling \nHeidi, a therapist who worked with disabled children, was found slumped outside next to a lighter and an unlit cigarette. \nThe hearing was told Heidi, mum to Billy Jo, 13, was not a heavy drinker and had died of alcohol toxicity. \nA post-mortem revealed she had 380mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood – the drink-drive limit being 80mg, an inquest in Taunton, Somerset, heard. \nSenior Somerset Coroner Tony Williams recorded a verdict of accidental death and said there were no suspicious circumstances. \nHe said: ‘For some reason, the alcohol she drank that night resulted in her death. There were no suspicious circumstances at all.’ Woman facing jail for false rape allegations against her ex \nThe inquest heard Ms Hopley had been out with friends and family at Bridgwater Fair the night before she died. \nShe had arrived back at her house in North Petherton in Somerset at around 10.30pm where they each drank three vodkas with lemonade, before calling it a night. \nWhen Scott found her the next morning, he carried her inside and called an ambulance, but she was declared dead at 7.33am on October 1. \nScott told the inquest that Ms Hopley had poured the drinks the night before and while she wasn’t a heavy drinker, may have been used to that level of alcohol. \nMs Hopley’s GP said that she had a history of high blood pressure, but none of heavy drinking or alcohol abuse. Fiance of children's author Helen Bailey jailed for 34 years for her murder \nThe Brainwave Centre where Mrs Hopley worked caters for children with a range of disabilities, including cerebral palsy and genetic disorders. \nShe stayed there all her working life and helped to start clinics in Japan, Finland, Scotland and Ireland. \nSpeaking when she died Chief executive Phil Edge said she was a credit to the organisation. \n‘The best tribute that can be paid is from the centre. She was extremely dear to them and they’re absolutely devastated – they can’t believe it. Man cuts up girlfriend's heels after they caused her to crash \n‘They called her the kindest girl they have ever worked with and said that she was completely dedicated to the children and families she worked with – they were always at the forefront of her mind.’ \nAt the time her father, Martin Felstead, 66, said family, friends and fellow workers were all shocked and devastated by her sudden death. \n‘She loved the area and the village – she’s lived here most of her life and she dedicated all her working life to Brainwave.’ \nMrs Hopley’s step sister Steph Keohane called her ‘the loveliest step sister I could have wished for’.
