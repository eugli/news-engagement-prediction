I will not be attending the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner this year. Please wish everyone well and have a great evening! \nTrump has had a strained relationship with the press calling journalists “the enemy of the people” and frequently criticizing outlets and individual reporters whose coverage he does not like. \nThe annual dinner will be held on April 29 in Washington. \nREAD MORE: Analysis: Donald Trump’s phoney war on ‘fake news’ \nSome news outlets such as Bloomberg News and the New Yorker have said they will not host the lavish after-parties that have been a fixture of past events. \nOn Friday, the White House excluded several major U.S. news organizations, including some it has criticized, from an off-camera briefing held by the White House press secretary. \nReporters for CNN , the New York Times , Politico, The Los Angeles Times and BuzzFeed were not allowed into the session in the office of press secretary Sean Spicer , a decision that drew strong protests. \nREAD MORE: Some media blocked from White House briefing after Donald Trump attacks ‘fake news’ during CPAC speech \nThe event occasionally makes news: in 2011, President Barack Obama delivered a scathing evisceration of Trump , joking that the mogul, who sat stone-faced in the audience, would move on from questioning Obama’s citizenship to figuring out “did we fake the moon landing.” \nCritics say the event, which usually features a humorous speech by the sitting president, encourages journalists to cozy up to politicians they should cover aggressively. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T03:13:11.756+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
