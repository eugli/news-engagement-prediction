Each of the three scenes we find Jobs backstage before launching a new product. This film was adapted from Walter Issacson’s authorized biography.Sorkin’s decision to place the films setting backstage is symbolic to the films theme. This isn’t Steve Job’s greatest hits, rather, they are human moments as told by those who were close to Jobs. If your looking for the traditional biopic, then stick with the lackluster “Jobs\" with Aston Kutcher. If you want a sleek stylish film that takes risks (like Jobs himself)then this film is for you. Terrible adaptation. Boring. Historically Inaccurate. by jwaire As a Sorkin fan, I'm absolutely disappointed by this film. He failed to tell the story of one of the most iconic and interesting people since Walt Disney.Much of the film is historically inaccurate. The forced placement of reappearing characters (Sculley, Wozniak, Lisa Jobs, Hertzfield, etc.) during the three acts felt contrived and at times outright bizarre.I'm not sure why Sorkin even bothered to license the Walter Isaacson biography because little source material was used.If Sorkin wanted to release a stage play that took such creative liberties, he should not have named the film \"Steve Jobs.\" Great “inspired by” 3 act play, but bad movie biopic by DarthSanchez Seen as a 3 act play -inspired by parts of the life of Steve Jobs- this is a wonderfully ACTED movie. Unfortunately, Aaron Sorkin took way too many artistic liberties in his screen play, and as a biopic of Steve Jobs, this is a very poor movie.It’s played out in 3 scenes set in 1984, 1988, and 1998 and the same two themes are repeated in various forms: Steve was a difficult individual, and he was a bad father to his daughter Lisa. Unfortunately, the movie’s commitment to these two themes is so complete, that the screen play shows very little else and goes as far as distorting events/dates to fit this narrative.It’s also worth noting that this movie completely ignores the 1998-2011 period in his life, which is actually the period that offers the most evidence against the two themes presented in this movie (they did not fit the narrative). To not even mention Steve’s later life with wife, kids, and even Lisa clearly shows how the makers of this movie wanted to portray him.So watch this as a wonderfully acted 3 act Sorkin play that was inspired by a very limited interpretation of Steve’s life. But don’t think you’re watching anything even close to a more encompassing and fair biopic of Steve’s life. For that, read the book by Walter Isaacson.
