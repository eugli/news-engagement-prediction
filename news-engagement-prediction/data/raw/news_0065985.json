Rec Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images During his introductory press conference as a new member of the New Orleans Pelicans , DeMarcus Cousins said the thing that hurt most about being traded from the Sacramento Kings was “probably the way it was done. The dishonesty that came with it.” In a groundbreaking deal, Sacramento dealt Cousins to the New Orleans Pelicans in exchange for rookie guard Buddy Hield , Tyreke Evans , Langston Galloway , and 2017 first- and second-round picks. The deal came moments after the NBA All-Star Game . But in a meeting in early February, Kings general manager Vlade Divac told Cousins and his representatives the team would not trade him ahead of the Feb. 23 trade deadline. They held the same position as trade discussions picked up during the All-Star break. I'm told DeMarcus Cousins (still) is not being traded, even as teams inquire about his availability. Nothing's changed — Jason Jones (@mr_jasonjones) February 19, 2017 Divac also echoed similar sentiments to ESPN.com’s Marc Stein. \"We're not trading DeMarcus (Cousins),\" he told Stein in early February . \"We hope he's here for a long time.\" Cousins’ agent were so sure he would not be dealt, he dismissed the trade rumors buzzing during the All-Star Game.

He was in line to command a “designated player” contract worth up to $209 million over five years — a deal only the Kings could have offered. The Pelicans can offer a max contract of five years worth $180 million. Cousins said Divac tried to call him after the deal was done, but he did not answer. \"Vlade (Divac) tried to call after it was done. But, it's done,\" @boogiecousins — Marc J. Spears (@MarcJSpearsESPN) February 22, 2017 It’s unclear if the specter of an expensive long-term commitment played a role in the Kings’ decision to move Cousins, but Boogie says he has moved on. And it remains to be seen how Divac going back on his word will impact his relationship with free agents moving forward.
