And their latest filter, dedicated to Daft Punk , just might be the best one yet. \nIn addition to a version of their signature helmets, the filter also includes audio from their track \"Doin' it Right,\" off their last full-length album, Random Access Memories , and \"One More Time,\" from their 2001 album, Discovery . \nThe filter debuted yesterday on the app with little explanation. But it doesn't come as too much of a surprise. \nThe duo will perform at the ceremony with the Weeknd for their number one single \"Starboy.\" And over the weekend, the duo opened their first pop-up shop , filled with Daft Punk apparel, memorabilia and other collector's items. Skrillex even headlined the store's opening. In 2017, Dat Punk also celebrates the 20th anniversary of their seminal album, Homework . \nPreview the Daft Punk Snapchat filter below. \nThis is the best snapchat filter ? â€” Denver (@denv10) February 12, 2017 Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:08:10.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
