Tetchy Blair SNAPS at BBC reporter after anti-Brexit speech A TETCHY Tony Blair snapped at a BBC reporter during a Q&A following his anti-Brexit speech in central London today. PUBLISHED: 11:20, Fri, Feb 17, 2017 | UPDATED: 11:39, Fri, Feb 17, 2017 \nThe former prime minister unveiled his mission to persuade the UK to stay in the EU , saying Brexiteers voted “without knowledge” on June 23 last year. \nMr Blair said Brexiteers had benefited from a “propensity for revolt” but their views were not set in stone. \nHe was then asked by BBC political reporter Carole Walker whether he was the right man to deliver such a strong anti-Brexit message. \nReplying Mr Blair said: “You can like the messenger or not like the messenger and this is a free country. \n“I have got a right to speak and you have got the freedom to listen or not.

But the people voted without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit. \n\"As these terms become clear, it is their right to change their mind. Our mission is to persuade them to do so,\" he said. I have got a right to speak and you have got the freedom to listen or not Tony Blair \n\"What was unfortunately only dim in our sight before the referendum is now in plain sight. The road we're going down is not simply hard Brexit. It is Brexit at any cost. \n\"Our challenge is to expose relentlessly what this cost is, to show how the decision was based on imperfect knowledge which will now become informed knowledge, to calculate in 'easy to understand' ways how proceeding will cause real damage to our country; and to build support for finding a way out from the present rush over the cliff's edge. \n\"I don't know if we can succeed. But I do know we will suffer a rancorous verdict from future generations if we do not try.\" \nFollowing Mr Blair’s speech, Nick Clegg said he agreed with “every single word” the former PM had said. \nJeremy Corbyn was also targeted by Mr Blair and said there was an absence of effective opposition.
