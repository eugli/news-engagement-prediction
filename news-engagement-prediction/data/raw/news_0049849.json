Everything you need to know about this week's Tube strike \nNight Tube began last August on the Central and Victoria lines, nearly a year later than planned because Tube and union bosses could not reach agreement on the complex shift arrangements, pay and working conditions. \nMr Cash said: “It is outrageous that London Underground (LU) have decided to discriminate against their Night Tube drivers. \n“This is a senseless and damaging policy that picks out one group of staff for negative treatment and of course the drivers are angry and that is why we are balloting for action. \n“RMT would call on LU to see sense, stop these stupid attacks on career progression and fair reward for overtime working and confirm that this discrimination against the Night Tube drivers has been lifted.” \nThe union is understood to represent just under half of Night Tube drivers with the remainder mostly belonging to the rival Aslef union. \nA walkout by RMT members would cause huge disruption to the 24-hour service – but some Aslef drivers are also said to be unhappy with the situation and the union could join in the dispute. \nA second strike by RMT drivers on the busy Central line, used by more than 800,000 passengers a day, is due to begin from 9 pm tomorrow and lasting all day Wednesday. \nLU warned the Waterloo & City line, which uses the same pool of drivers, is not expected to operate at all on Wednesday. \nThe dispute is over the “forced” transfer of eight drivers from their home depots in the East of London to those to the west. \nThe first 24-hour walkout last month caused huge disruption. \nLU said the Central line would close from 11.30 pm tomorrow. \nOn Wednesday there will be no Waterloo & City and no Central line east of Leytonstone; from 05:30 there will be no westbound Central line between White City and Leytonstone \nFrom 7 am there will only be a “very limited” service throughout the entire line. It will close at 11 pm. \nSome other stations and lines will also be much busier during the strike, particularly in the morning and evening peaks. These include Chingford, Ilford and Leytonstone. \nOther stations and lines that will also be much busier include TfL Rail services between Romford and Stratford, particularly Ilford station, and London Overground lines and stations between Liverpool Street and Chingford. \nThe Victoria line will be much busier than usual, particularly Walthamstow Central, as will the Jubilee line between London Bridge and Waterloo. \nCustomers may have to queue outside stations during peak times to prevent overcrowding, and it may take longer than usual to board a train.
