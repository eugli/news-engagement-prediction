Dennis McCoy | Sacramento Business Journal In an effort to raise its curb appeal, the brewing equipment will be visible from J and 15th streets at the new restaurant and brewery being developed by the Burgers & Brew owners. The J Street location will be called Burgers & Brewhouse to distinguish it from the other Burgers & Brew locations in Sacramento, West Sacramento, Davis and Chico, said co-owner Derar Zawaydeh . The brewery itself will be called Sacrament, after one of their popular beers. Burgers & Brewhouse is on track to open this summer. Dennis McCoy | Sacramento Business Journal Construction is now in full swing on the building at 1616 J St., at the point where downtown Sacramento turns into the restaurant and nightclub neighborhood of midtown. Zawaydeh said the business is on track to open this summer. What looks like continuous and windowless cinder-block walls now will be opened up to allow pedestrians and drivers to see the brewing equipment through glass walls yet to be installed. Much of the brewing equipment and kettles will be in the basement of the building, with some of the barrels and beer storage rising through to the first floor. The basement brewery will be visible from the restaurant through glass walls and flooring, Zawaydeh said. With the basement and ground floor, the building is roughly 12,800 square feet, but the design will actually expand that with an upstairs outdoor patio on the roof. The building has been under construction for about a year, and it has been quiet for about two years. When it was last open, it was a nightclub called Purgatory, part of a succession of short-lived businesses in the location. Zawaydeh has had plans for the J Street site since early in 2014, but other projects have taken precedence, he said. The newest Burgers & Brew opened in early December in a remodeled historic former fire station in West Sacramento. That new location was months behind schedule. But now that it has opened, it is doing tremendous business, Zawaydeh said. The new West Sacramento location at 317 Third St. has started strong with its lunch business, happy hour and dinner. Its weekend brunch and late night live music offerings are also popular, he said.
