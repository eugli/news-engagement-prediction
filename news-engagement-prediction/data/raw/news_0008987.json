(Photo: Getty Images) \nGood news! According to a bunch of reports from the National Association of Colleges and Employers , Fortune and others , now is a great time to be graduating from college and heading into the workforce. And that’s a good thing since entry-level jobs and salaries have a huge impact on lifetime career trajectories. So what can you do now to set yourself up for success in your post-college career? \nKnock your internship out of the park. \nMaking a killer impression on your internship supervisor will serve you for multiple reasons. Having a former supervisor in your corner can benefit you for the long haul. Think glowing recommendation letters, coveted job offers or referrals for freelance work. \nBut sometimes internships are treated as a box to check in order to get a diploma and start your “real” job. And managers can smell the difference between someone who needs to complete an internship to graduate and those who are really passionate about the work from a mile away. So don’t miss an opportunity. \nHere are five practical ways you can stand out and become the intern that holds the gold star standard for semesters to come. 1. Become the resident expert \nGet familiar with the organization. Learn the details of the products and services your company offers backward and forward. Investigate your boss’s goals. What matters most to her at work? Brainstorm how you can help her win. Related: 3 goals to set for your summer internship 2. Read slowly and ask questions \nWhen you get an assignment go ahead and repeat what you think your supervisor wants and ask if he has anything to add or adjust. When we want to prove our competence we often think that the best way to do that is by not asking any questions. But turning in an assignment half-completed or heading in the wrong direction will not help you look more competent. And it will not help your supervisor win. So read directions carefully and ask questions in advance and as you go. You do not need to know everything during your internship. So lose your fear of looking dumb. You’re ultimately there to learn, try new things, and get experience. 3. Build relationships with the people you work with \nDon’t be afraid to get chummy, but keep it professional. Grab coffee with colleagues and ask for career advice or discuss the latest Star Wars movie. But avoid criticizing what a co-worker wore to the office or discussing the latest office gossip. Work bonds are important for enjoying your life day to day and down the road. Be intentional with relationships. Take the time to invest in people. 4. Come to your internship site each day ready to learn AND ready to contribute \nYou have a different and fresh perspective that is of great value to any company. While you do have a lot to learn, that learning may come on the job and it may come from doing your homework outside of your internship. So jot down ideas when they come to you in the shower. Read up on your industry and don’t be afraid to share articles or studies with coworkers and superiors. 5. Make deadlines your best friend \nIn fact, get stuff done early. You’d be surprised how rare it is for interns to be early and over-prepared. This is an easy win. Always aim to be 5-10 minutes early to a meeting and a day or two early on an assignment deadline. \nThe relationships you build during your internship can be just as helpful long-term as the experience you get. Approaching your internship with intention, anticipating the needs of your supervisor, and showing up hungry to learn and to contribute will make you an all-star intern. \nHilary Sutton is a creative who writes about personal development, creativity, digital media and career.
