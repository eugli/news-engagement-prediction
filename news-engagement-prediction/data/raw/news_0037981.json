So when veteran actor Randhir Kapoor recently turned 70, daughters Karisma Kapoor, Kareena Kapoor Khan and son-in-law Saif Ali Khan decided to ring in his big day in true Kapoor style. The two daughters threw a lavish birthday party at their Chembur house, and invited close friends and family for the do. \n\nThe uber stylish daughters, dressed in ethnic wear, looked nothing less than gorgeous. While Karisma was seen donning a stunning embroidered beige outfit, Kareena dazzled in a Manish Malhotra number. Looks like the new mommy is already getting back in shape post pregnancy. \n\nAmitabh Bachchan dropped in to wish his friend of many years on his birthday. Randhir's brother Rishi and Neetu Kapoor joined the celebrations with their son Ranbir Kapoor . Karisma and Kareena's close friends Malaika Arora Khan and Amrita Arora were also a part of the guest list. Randhir's 'Rampur Ka Lakshman' co-star Rekha too joined the bash. Jeetendra, Rakesh Roshan, Sanjay Kapoor, Boney Kapoor, Amisha Patel, JP Dutta, Prem Chopra, Poonam Dhillon and many others graced the big night. \n\nKarisma took to Instagram to share pictures from the night. In one of the pictures, the birthday boy is seen flanked by his daughters. Truly endearing, isn't it? The other one has Bebo's hubby Saif joining them for a happy family picture. \n\n\n#happy70th‚ù§Ô∏è#weloveyoupapaüòá \n\nA post shared by KK (@therealkarismakapoor) on Feb 15, 2017 at 10:04am PST \n#birthday#selfieüéâ#love#family#goodtimes#memories#weloveyoupapa‚ù§Ô∏è \n\nA post shared by KK (@therealkarismakapoor) on Feb 15, 2017 at 9:46am PST", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T17:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T07:27:14.786+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
