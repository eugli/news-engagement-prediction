Wade Case Wanted The Ruling Overturned February 18, 2017 \nNorma McCorvey, who was 'Jane Roe' in the Roe v. Wade case that gave a woman the constitutional right to legally undergo an abortion, died on Feb. 18 at the age of 69. \nUpon her death and for decades prior, McCorvey was not pro-choice, but pro-life.   \nIn 1969, a 22-year-old McCorvey was homeless, divorced and drug-addicted when she became pregnant for a third time. Her mother was raising her first child, and the second had been given up for adoption, according to Independent Journal Review. \nShe went to an adoption agency, but then got in contact with two attorneys, Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington, who wanted to file a class-action lawsuit against the state of Texas to legalize abortion. McCorvey's case would find its way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ultimately ruled that a woman has the right to terminate a pregnancy under the constitutional right to privacy.   \nBut when Operation Rescue, a pro-life Christian activist organization, opened its doors next to the abortion clinic McCorvey worked in, she switched sides. \nIn 1998, McCorvey told Larry King that she would like to see Roe v. Wade overturned. \nKing asked why she would want to take away a woman's right to choose, of which McCorvey responded, \"I don't really feel like she really wants that abortion,\" CNN reports. \nMcCorvey confirmed to King that her third child was carried to term and adopted, and that she has never had an abortion. \nOperation Rescue issued a statement on its website about McCorvey's death. \n“I am deeply saddened at the loss of our dear friend Norma McCorvey,” president Troy Newman said in the Feb. 18 statement. \"She spent the better part of the last 25 years working to undo the terrible Supreme Court decision that bears her name. Her work was not in vain. Norma became an inspiration for so many, and we at Operation Rescue work every day to achieve her goal of ending abortion in America.” \nPresident Donald Trump is pro-life and said in October 2016, before he was elected, that overturning Roe v. Wade \"will happen, automatically,\" according to CNBC. \nHe said that if the Supreme Court justices' he appoints overturn the decision, whether to legalize abortion will go back to the individual states, as it was before Roe v. Wade. \nDuring Trump's first week in office, he signed an executive order banning federal money from going to international groups that perform or provide information on abortions, the BBC reported. The decision does not affect services in the U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:01:24.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
