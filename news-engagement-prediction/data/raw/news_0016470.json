After the deaths of her mother, Carrie Fisher, and grandmother, Debbie Reynolds , in December, the 24-year-old actress shared a photo of herself looking at peace while standing next to a body of water. Lourd captioned the photo with the hashtags \"#Blas√©OnTheOutsideBlessedOnTheInside,\" \"#ByTheBayou\" and \"#FindingTheFunny.\" A photo posted by Billie Lourd (@praisethelourd) on Feb 6, 2017 at 3:18pm PST A photo posted by Taylor Lautner (@taylorlautner) on Feb 6, 2017 at 1:52pm PST Lourd commented: \"Missin my baes.\" WATCH: Billie Lourd Jets Off to Cabo With Taylor Lautner After Heartbreaking Family Deaths Lourd's recent getaway comes just a few weeks after she shared a lighthearted photo of herself hanging out with friends, who were all wearing onesies. \"This group of onesie clad supremely supportive humans (and many others #notpicturedbutinthepicture) are the kings and queens of my world,\" she captioned the photo, along with the hashtags \"#gratefulfortheirgreatness\" and \"#friendsfindingthefunny.\" \"Finding the funny\" appears to be advice Lourd is taking from her late mother. A few weeks ago, she posted a childhood photo of herself and quoted the Star Wars actress , writing: \"If my life weren't funny then it would just be true and that is unacceptable.\" Lourd added, \"Finding the funny might take a while but I learned from the best and her voice will forever be in my head and in my heart.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:55:57.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
