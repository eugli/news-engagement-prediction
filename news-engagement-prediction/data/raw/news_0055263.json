By Brittany Wong \nNo, Jennifer Lopez doesn’t exclusively date younger men ― she just happens to end up with them quite a bit recently. (We see you, Casper Smart and possibly Drake .) \nIn an interview with Ellen DeGeneres Tuesday , the 47-year-old pop star and actress objected when the talk show host suggested she has a thing for younger men. \n“I don’t date younger men. It’s not like you have to be younger, it’s not about that.
