Joe Giddens/WPA Pool/Getty Images \nThe third of four engraved £5 notes worth £50,000 has been found leaving one more still undiscovered. \nOne more of the highly-valuable fivers, marked with a tiny engraving of Jane Austen by acclaimed artist Graham Short, is still yet to be found. \nThe four incredibly rare notes were secretly released into circulation across the UK last year. \nThe Birmingham-based artist spent each of the notes in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Micro-artist Graham Short has engraved four fivers with a miniature portrait of Jane Austen.

New £5 note worth £50k is found after cafe manager gave it away \nHe told the BBC an old lady found one of the notes in Northern Ireland. \n\"An old lady found it and she said 'I don't want my picture in the papers' and she said 'if it sells for a lot of money it will be better if young children could benefit from it',\" he said. \nEach of the notes have been insured by the Tony Huggins-Haig Gallery in Kelso, which launched the project, for £50,000. \nThe people who received the notes in Wales and Scotland said they wanted to keep the notes rather than sell them.
