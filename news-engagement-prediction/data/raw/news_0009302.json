Liar Pilot A photograph purportedly showing Melania Trump's grandmother is actually actress Janet Leigh in the 1957 movie \"Jet Pilot\". - - \nClaim: A photograph shows Melania Trump's grandmother, Olga Orlif, who was a Soviet Soldier in World War II. FALSE \nOrigin: In January 2017, photographs began to show up on social media along with the claim that they were images of Melania Trump's grandmother, purportedly a Soviet soldier named Olga Orlif: \nThe earliest versions of this rumor that we could uncover were accompanied by Russian text, which we have translated below: \nСтарший лейтенант Советской Армии Ольга Орлиф - бабушка югославки Мелании Трамп :-)? \nSenior Lieutenant of the Soviet Army Olga Orlif - grandma of Melania Trump \nThis photograph actually shows actress Janet Leigh as Lt. Anna Marladovna (later Lt. Anna Shannon) in the 1957 movie \"Jet Pilot,\" a film about a Russian pilot who may or may not be a spy. (It remains unclear whether this particular image is a still from the film, or if it was an official promotional photograph.) \nThe web site TheRedList.com featured another image of Leigh in her Soviet Army costume: \nInformation about the real grandparents of Melania Trump (previously Melania Knauss) remains scarce online. The only tidbit we were able uncover was that her grandparents lived in Sevnica, a town in Slovenia, and that her grandfather developed a red onion variety called the Raka — but even that tidbit is anecdotal . \nWhile we don't know much about the First Lady's grandmother, a photograph of a Soviet soldier who looks a lot like Janet Leigh along with the claim that it shows Melania Trump's grandmother is actually Janet Leigh dressed as a Soviet soldier for a 1957 movie role.
