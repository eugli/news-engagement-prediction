REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo 2/2 \nSEOUL Plans for the first contact between North Korea and the United States after President Donald Trump took office were canceled after the U.S. State Department denied a visa for the top envoy from Pyongyang, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. \nThe talks, between senior North Korean foreign ministry envoy Choe Son Hui and former U.S. officials, were scheduled to take place on March 1 and 2 in New York but were called off after Choe was denied a visa, the Journal said. \nIt was not clear what led the State Department to deny the visa but North Korea's test-firing of a ballistic missile on Feb. 12 and the murder of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's half brother in Malaysia may have played a role, the report said. \nSouth Korean and U.S. officials have said they believe North Korean agents assassinated Kim Jong Nam, the estranged half brother of Kim Jong Un, on Feb. 13. \nA South Korean foreign ministry official declined to comment on the report of the canceled meeting in New York, saying the reported plan did not involve the U.S. or South Korean government. The U.S. Embassy in Seoul did not have comment. \nThe meeting in New York would have been the first time a senior North Korean envoy would visit the United States since 2011 and the first contact between U.S. and North Korean representatives since Trump took office. \nChoe, director general for North American affairs at the North's foreign ministry, has previously met former U.s. officials and academics, the last time in November in Geneva for informal discussions. \nTrump said in a Reuters interview on Thursday that he was concerned about North Korea's ballistic missile tests and \"it's a very dangerous situation\". Trump did not ruling out meeting Kim at some point in the future under certain circumstances but suggested it might be too late. \n(Reporting by Jack Kim and Tony Munroe) Next In World News One question at U.N. Syria talks: What does Russia want? \nGENEVA The first U.N.-led Syria peace talks in almost a year are in danger of getting lost in procedure, as officials obsess about who will meet whom, but behind the scenes diplomats say it's largely up to Russia to call the tune. Chemical weapon VX nerve agent killed North Korean leader's half brother: Malaysian police \nKUALA LUMPUR VX nerve agent, a chemical the United Nations classifies as a weapon of mass destruction, was used to kill the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in a bizarre murder in Malaysia last week, police said on Friday. \nBERLIN Europe should impose punitive tariffs on imports from the United States if President Donald Trump acts to shield U.S. industries from foreign competitors, a senior ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a newspaper interview.
