(Photo: Casey Sapio, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTUCSON, Ariz. — Lonzo Ball’s father, LaVar, doesn’t shy away from giving his opinion about anything related to his son, the star of the No. 5 UCLA men’s basketball team. \nBut he's a bit much, even with an extremely talented son projected to be a top-three pick in June’s NBA draft. \nLaVar said last week that Lonzo is better than two-time NBA MVP Steph Curry … already. He then said Saturday that the only team Lonzo will play for is the Los Angeles Lakers, then attempted to clarify that by saying he wants his son to play for the Lakers and learn from Magic Johnson. \nLately, LaVar has been in the headlines more frequently than his son has — which could certainly be seen as a distraction, or at the very least an annoyance. But not to Lonzo, who spoke to reporters after beating Arizona, 77-72 . \n\"No, it’s not distracting,\" Lonzo Ball said. \"I just go out there and play basketball.\" \nWhen asked specifically about the Lakers comment, Ball replied: \"All I do is go out there and play basketball.\" \nPHOTOS: Best in college hoops this week Facebook A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
