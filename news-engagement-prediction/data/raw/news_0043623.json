A climate-change skeptic who has sued the E.P.A. fourteen times . A billionaire Republican donor who has possibly never seen the inside of a public school . A physician who wants to gut the Affordable Care Act . A guy who once likened affordable housing to communism . These are just a sampling of the remarkable examples of Donald Trump ’s phenomenal sense of irony when it comes to his Cabinet nominees—in this case, Scott Pruitt for the E.P.A., Betsy DeVos for the Department of Education, Tom Price for Health and Human Services, and Ben Carson for H.U.D.—whose main qualifications appear to be unbridled hatred for the agencies they’ve been tasked with leading. So the fact that Jay Clayton , Trump’s pick for chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , wants to scale back regulation shouldn’t come as a shock. In fact, the only shocking thing about it is that he hasn’t vowed to burn the entire agency to the ground. Still, it’s hilarious— if you’re at the laughing stage of grief with the Trump administration—that it was Clayton’s desire to see Wall Street be less regulated that got him the gig (pending confirmation). Per the Journal : \nIn late November, Jay Clayton was called by a longtime client seeking advice for how the Trump administration should tackle scaling back rules on Wall Street. \nMr. Clayton, a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP who has represented Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., dashed off an email explaining how government could promote growth by easing what he considered unnecessary regulations on raising capital, according to a person familiar with the matter. The correspondence was shared with Trump advisers, who were impressed and asked if there might be a position that would interest him. Mr. Clayton replied: “SEC chairman.” \nShortly after a late-December meeting with then-President-elect Donald Trump in Mar-a-Lago, Fla., he was offered the job. \nMr. Clayton would replace Mary Jo White , a former U.S. attorney chosen by President Barack Obama for her reputation as an aggressive prosecutor. By comparison, Mr. Clayton, a lawyer who has guided dozens of firms through stock sales and mergers, has written that federal foreign-bribery investigations unfairly shackle U.S. companies in their pursuit of growth overseas. Naturally, Clayton shares Trump’s view that Dodd-Frank, the legislation passed in the wake of the financial crisis to prevent another one, asks too much of banks.

Donald Trump of France scares the hell out of investors The potential of Marine Le Pen, the right-wing candidate for president, coming through with a victory has sent a shiver down investors’ spines. Per the Financial Times : \nThe gap between the yield on 10-year French debt and German equivalent bonds exceeded 0.81 percentage points for the first time since August 2012, as a fresh poll showing far right candidate Marine Le Pen is on course to emerge as a clear winner in the first round vote to be held in late April. Daily trading volumes in French bonds is at its highest since the crisis that gripped the eurozone in 2010 to 2012, as the possibility of Ms Le Pen, whose National Front party has pledged to pull the country from the euro, spooks some investors. Citigroup pays to end rand-rigging investigation The bank has agreed to fork over 70 million rand ($5.4 million) to settle “a South African antitrust investigation that said the U.S. bank participated in an alleged cartel to manipulate the value of the rand.” As part of the settlement, Citi has also graciously offered to provide witnesses to “help prosecute other banks that participated in price fixing and market allocation in the trading of foreign-currency pairs involving the rand.” Samsung heir didn’t exactly see his life playing out this way In 2014, Lee Jae-yong took over Samsung Group from his father and pledged “to reshape the conglomerate along Silicon Valley lines, promising an era of transparency and accountability in an institution known for its opaque corporate culture—in a country whose modern history has seen a succession of business and political leaders engulfed in corruption scandals.” Then this happened : \nOn Friday, the 48-year-old Mr. Lee was arrested in connection with a wide-ranging scandal that includes the impeachment of South Korea’s president. Prosecutors accuse Mr. Lee, Samsung Electronics Co. vice chairman, of bribery, embezzlement and perjury in connection with roughly 43 billion won (about $37 million) in payments Samsung made to entities allegedly linked to a friend of President Park Geun-hye’s. Lee has denied wrongdoing and previously told investigators that he was “coerced” into contributing the funds. Trump finally finds someone willing to be his National Security Adviser Lieutenant General H. R. McMaster gets to pick up where Mike Flynn left off. Per CNBC: \nPresident Trump announced the pick at his Palm Beach club, Mar-a-Lago, saying McMaster is “a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience.” \nMcMaster, 54, is a West Point graduate known as “H.R.,” with a PhD in U.S. history from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He was listed as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people in 2014, partly because of his willingness to buck the system. Elsewhere! Saudi Arabia Favors New York for Aramco I.P.O.
