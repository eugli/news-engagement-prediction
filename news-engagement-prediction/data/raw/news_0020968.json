Raising the limit \"just makes sense.\"\nEstimated cost: More than $500M Scheer's campaign estimates that making benefits tax-free would cost the federal government at least $500-600 million annually, a calculation based taking the number of EI maternity and parental leave claimants in 2014-15 and assuming an average annual income among them of about $50,000, triggering a 15 per cent federal taxation rate.\nA more precise cost would vary each year based on how many parents drew benefits and how high their rates of taxation would otherwise be.\n\nAs Prime Minister I will make EI maternal and parental benefits tax free. https://t.co/s0anQlUH0p pic.twitter.com/3eurG7bMaa \n— @andrewscheer If taking time off work to care for children became more popular as a result of this kind of change, the cost to the government would rise.\nOn the other hand, children in lower- and middle-income families could benefit from the boost to their household's budget.\n​ O'Leary shrugs off attacks at Conservative debate Candidates spar over jobs, taxes while taking aim at O'Leary O'Leary spent almost all of the 1st week of campaign in U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:09:41.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
