But playing against a club from his homeland, the scrutiny on his performance was increased. \nKahn said: “Of course Arsenal have their qualities, especially on the counter-attack, and they have good players like Ozil, but I haven’t seen him. Maybe you saw him. \n“It’s sad to see what Ozil is calling a performance, how passive he plays, a player of his genius and qualities — it’s a shame.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:30:48.652+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
