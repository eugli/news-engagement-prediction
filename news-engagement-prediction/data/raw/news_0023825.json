The UK will continue to build this partnership between our two countries”. \nThrough the new Economic Development Strategy DFID will build the potential for developing countries to trade more with the UK and the world. \nThey will also focus investment in job-creating sectors such as manufacturing, infrastructure and commercial agriculture to provide strong foundations for sustainable growth. \nThey will also support strengthen institutions, tackle corruption and help countries mobilise their domestic resources to support their development. \n“There is no task more urgent than defeating poverty. The UK has a proud record of supporting people in desperate humanitarian crises, but emergency help alone won't tackle the global changes we face,” International Development Secretary was quoted as saying in a statement. \nThe overall support over the last five years has helped “lift 1.5 m Bangladeshi citizens out of extreme poverty; provided access to safe water for 1.3 m people; helped 550 000 women give birth safely and ensured 500 000 children complete primary school education”. \nHead of DFID Bangladesh Jane Edmondson said this new Strategy demonstrates “our continued commitment to promoting growth which transforms economies, creates productive jobs and private sector investment and spreads the benefits and opportunities right across society, including to girls and women.” \nBritain is the only G7 country that meets the target of spending 0.7 percent of GNI on overseas development.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T17:55:11.696+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
