The French company is mostly known for its connected health devices, but Withings built a smartwatch as well.Withings launched the Activite Sapphire smartwatch back in 2014, followed by two different variants the next year: Activite Steel and Activite Pop. The smartwatch is compatible with both Android and iOS smartphones, but it lacks any external buttons. Since it was acquired by the Finnish company, Withings operates under Nokia Technologies' Digital Health division, so it's hard to say what new devices it might unveil later this week.A smartphone accessory, a health app that would be exclusive to Nokia smartphones, or even an Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch , are among the possible products Withings could announce on February 26. HMD Global plans to introduce at least three Nokia-branded handsets at MWC 2017: Nokia 3, Nokia 5, and a modern Nokia 3310. Withings' announcement might be related to any or all of these phones.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:43:25.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
