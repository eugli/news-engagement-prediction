The Best Feel Good Movie by magana_anap Every once in a while a feel-good movie will come out and everyone will call it a chick flick. I have a problem with that. This movie isn't a chick flick it is a movie about romance (Valentine's Day!), forgiveness, independence, acceptance, love, and fun. I've seen a lot of movies saved by the cast (you know, you kind of watch just for the actor's twist on the script) but this one would have made it for me even without all of the amazing actors. The fact that many brilliant actors were in this movie is really the cherry on top. The reason I like it so much is because it really does include all different stages and types of relationships. Movies like the notebook are awesome but the problem is they leave you wanting that kind of dramatic romance. This movie helps you realize that there are all different kinds of real life relationships and all of them can be romantic even when you're not on a canoe floating in the middle of thousands of swans or whatever they were (I would love that but that isn't the point). Every actor does a great job in his/her role and some really interesting things happen in this plot. I have no complaints. I like to buy movies I'd like to watch over and over again and this will definitely be one of them. Great relatable, feel good movie. Don't hate; by Serena<3 ily justin bieberâ™¥ This movie was amazing. I smiled through every part. Trust me on this...this movie is worth your time and money. It's more of a chick flick so thats probably why guys aren't liking it. But hey, why did they watch it in the 1st place? It's called VALENTINES DAY. I knew it was going to be a chick flick from the cover and previews. All I'm saying is don't listen to the guys. Get this movie.
