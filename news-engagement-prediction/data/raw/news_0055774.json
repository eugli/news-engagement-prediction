Samsung has screwed up their button order for years and doesn’t seem to care that Google has turned almost every other OEM onto the back button being on the left” \nI understand Google and probably most peeps here feel this way, but that doesn’t make Samsung’s order of the buttons “wrong” and in many people’s opinion, mine included, Samsung’s order makes FAR MORE sense than Google’s. \nIt’s a preference thing, not a right or wrong thing. Chris M \nhow does it make FAR MORE sense? Miguel A. \nIf you’re right handed, it just makes more sense to go back with your right hand. The menu button isn’t needed as often anymore. And with phones getting that much bigger, reaching across the device to move back is cumbersome (for right handed people anyway) Chris M \nim right handed and find it akward. i use a samsung for work and pixel for personal. I dont think it flows in the every day use of the phone. I catch myself looking at the Samsung to hit the button to go back where on my Pixel its just natural. \nClearly you and I are alone in this thinking. 🙁 \nWe need to get everyone onto a Pixel heh. JruASAP \nNah- I’m with you Kellen. Google’s standard order makes more sense for a right-handed user, but hopefully they just let everyone change it to their preference in the software settings. \nBack button should be on the left, headphone jack should be on the bottom (and on the phone to begin with) lol Cakefish \nI’m right handed and have no preference either way. I hold my phones in both hands equally. needa \nI’ll send you my address, or should I send it to Steve? Miguel A. \nI could see how that could be a problem. At work we use Windows and scrolling is regular, at home I use a Mac and it’s natural scrolling. It’s….annoying. Daniel Thomas \ncramping my right-handed thumb to get to the back button on the samsung left me with carpal tunnel OligarchyAmbulance \nLets use this logic then. \nIn a web browser, you go back more often than you go forward. Also, your mouse stays closer to the center of the screen the majority of the time (as the content is in the center, not the top corners). Using your logic, the Back button on a browser should be on the right, and the forward button should be on the left (the reverse of what we currently have). \nBut of course that would be utterly idiotic and nonsensical, so we keep the button facing left, further towards the left. As we should do with left-facing back buttons on phones. mcdonsco \nPersonal preference and comfort cannot be decided one way or the other to be right or wrong with logic. \nThat’s just stupid. \nThat’s like saying, logically someone is wrong to like chocolate. Makes ZERO sense. Miguel A. \nBut on a phone it’s ergonomics right? Of course it wouldn’t make sense on a computer – you can just glide a mouse over and click. It’s hardly the same. \nI’m with you, I have no idea. \nIt may be poll time! Steve \nI completely agree! I feel the order Samsung put them in makes more sense. However, you’re right… this is a preference thing, and not a right/wrong thing. With them being onscreen there is no reason they shouldn’t make them configurable. Just my opinion 🙂 Kellex B \nDefinitely gotta disagree on it making more sense. I’d rather keep my outstretched thumb and slide it effortlessly down to the back button on the left (if I’m holding with my right hand), then cramp my thumb back up to touch a right positioned one. Thumb is already outstretched to use the phone, so it just slides down onto back button on the left. If it’s on the right, I have to retract my thumb to press a button. That’s not an action I love. mcdonsco \nKeep your outstretched thumb? When you use your phone one handed (and right handed), do you keep your thumb as far stretched as possible THE ENTIRE TIME? That’s the only way your comment makes ANY sense. \nI’m using a Note right now, one handed (right) it is BY FAR easier to reach the back button which hopefully you agree is used far more than the multitasks button? It’s just right there. No stretching. No worries about dropping it because of how far you have to stretch your thumb. \nWell yeah, when you touch the middle of your screen, unless you have Shaq hands, you’d be outstretching your thumb. Then when you need to go from touching middle of phone to button, it’s outstretched. Pretty simple. mcdonsco \nHuh? \nGrab a large display phone, I know you have a ton laying around there…Hold it in your right hand using your pinky under it while it rests against your other fingers. Now, move your thumb to the left side button…Now the right side button. \nWhich one of those made your handling of the phone more precarious and more likely to drop it? \nThe ONLY right handed people that Google’s order would be more comfortable with ARE people with “Shaq hands”. \nNeither, but the left button was easier to touch and didn’t require a thumb cramp like the right button. mcdonsco \nAll right, I give up. You must have a double jointed thumb or something to allow you to torque it down that way with ease. \nI’m guessing you can probably do the splits with ease too? \n😆 needa \nI agree with Kellen. Another thing to mention is when you bend your thumb back, ou are ultimately releasing the grip on the phone. Whereas when reaching across to the left, you are pulling it in towards your hand. This is of course coming from someone that hasn’t used a Samsung phone since the gs2. I am sure if I were a Samsung user, I would be used to it. mcdonsco \nSee, in my experience and use it is COMPLETELY opposite. See my other posts mentioning the stability of the grip on the phone. \nTo each their own though AND further proof there is no right or wrong for this, just preferences. Kellex B \nThere may be some double jointed action here, but definitely no splits from this hot mess. \nOne thing I would mention too, is that as someone who jumps between phones all of the time, it’s always the Samsung phones that throw me off, even though we spend a hell of a lot of time with Galaxy S and Note phones. My mind (and thumb) is clearly just more comfortable going left I guess. pseudoswede \nAs a person of average size (e.g., I wear medium-sized gloves), it’s difficult for me to stretch my thumb across the bottom of the screen to hit a back button–and this is on a 5.2″ Galaxy S7. I couldn’t even imagine trying this on a 5.5″ or large phone. I much prefer the back button on the right side of the phone (since I’m right-handed). \nAnd, yes, my opinion may be biased since my line of phone ownership is Galaxy S3 -> Galaxy S4 -> Galaxy S6 -> Galaxy S7. Fred \nI’m with you all, my thumb naturally hovers more to the right side of the screen. Back button on the right is perfect for me. Banglaz Bless \nIsn’t that just like the finger scanner you’re talking about? You bend your index finger to reach it in the middle vs your outstretched finger at the far right corner of the device. You’ve just contradicted yourself. YouNex", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:38:59.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
