Harrison/Getty Images; Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic February 12, 2017 @ 11:15 PM \nHands up if you're still reeling from the 2017 Grammy Awards —not to mention, that insanely regal Beyoncé performance. It was music's biggest night, with all of the winning hair and makeup moments to drive the point home. Whether the stars were honoring another artist, putting on a performance, or being honored themselves, each of the beauty looks that lined the red carpet are platinum hits in and of themselves. Scroll down to see the 15 best looks of the night, including J. Lo, Lady Gaga, Carrie Underwood, and many, many more. Shop This Post Kevin Mazur/WireImage 1. Beyoncé \nHow do you complete a golden goddess hair and makeup look? A heavy metal manicure. Bey's manicurist Lisa Logan prepped her nails using OPI's Natural Nail Base Coat ($10; ulta.com ). She followed up with two coats of the brand's gilded Glitzerand Nail Lacquer ($14; amazon.com ), and a coat of OPI's Brillian High-Shine Top Coat ($14; ulta.com ). Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic 2. Lady Gaga \nExcuse the pun, but Gaga needs some applause. We’ve seen plenty of celebrities bring monochrome beauty looks to the red carpet, but Lady Gaga took it to an entirely new level at the 2017 Grammy Awards. She complemented her creamy hot pink lipstick with a metallic hot pink graphic cat eye and cotton candy pink hair, fashioned in an ultra voluminous pony. Steve Granitz/WireImage 3. Jennifer Lopez \nJ.Lo’s Grammys beauty looks are always legendary, and her appearance on the 2017 red carpet was no different. The singer perfectly matched her lavender gown with pastel purple shadow swiped across her eyelids and finished off the look with lots of lashes and a glossy nude lip. All that, plus her signature J.Lo glow and long sleek locks, secured her a place on our best of beauty list. Frazer Harrison/Getty Images 4. Carrie Underwood \nWith her dramatic red gown making the largest statement, Underwood went for an updo to show off the neckline, then kept focus on her eye area with gilded glitter lids and lush lashes. Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images 5. Chrissy Teigen \nWith her freshly-cut lob, courtesy of Jen Atkin, styled in shiny waves, Teigen's makeup artist Patrick Ta complemented the look with a smoked-out eye and a true beige lip. \"We wanted to create a rebellious, yet sexy, look on Chrissy,\" Ta tells InStyle . \"We went for an edgy, smoldering eye by layering shadows and liners, while keeping the lips neutral and glossy to tie in the dewy finish of her skin.\" The pro applied a layer of foundation, then chose a La Mer Concealer ($75; nordstrom.com ) two shades lighter than her skin tone to bring light to the face. He loaded up a brush with highlighter, then ran it along the high points of her face before shading the appropriate areas with a bronzy pink powder. On the eyes, Ta mixed Sephora's Colorful Eyeshadows in Copper Rush, Lucky Penny, and Pearl ($5 each; sephora.com ), then followed by smudging liner along her upper lash line. A few coats of mascara and brow pencil topped off the eye, and on the lips, Ta mixed the Sephora Liquid Matte in #23 ($14; sephora.com ) with the Sephora #04 lip liner ($12; sephora.com ), which he finished with a clear gloss. Joe Scarnici/Getty 6. Rihanna \nThe always-stunning Rihanna opted to wear her hair in long, loose curls, and kept her soft-focus smoky eye the focal point for her makeup. Her warm brick-toned blush played up the golden tones in her complexion. John Shearer/WireImage 7. Adele \nSay hello to another one of Adele’s retro-inspired makeup looks. Her makeup artist Michael Ashton created her signature cat-flick using Marc Jacobs Beauty Magic Marc'er Precision Pen Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner ($30; sephora.com ). For Adele's rosy lip, the pro lined her lips with Marc Jacobs Beuaty Le Marc Liquid Lip Creme in Slow Burn ($28; sephora.com ) and filled them in with Fawn Over Me, a peach nude. The whole look was tied together with a soft, twisted updo. Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty 8. Solange Knowles \nJust when we thought liquid liner couldn't possibly get cooler, along comes Solange with her unconventional placement of the classic product. The star wore her curls high on her crown, and kept her makeup pretty natural—save for two inky noir swipes above each crease. John Shearer/WireImage 9. Katy Perry \nKaty’s Grammys beauty look was a platinum hit. The singer paired her new light blonde hair with a soft pink smoky eye and coordinating rose lip. Her exact lip shades? A blend of Covergirl Katy Kat Matte Lipstick in Kitty Whispurr ($7; walgreens.com ) and Reddy to Pounce, a bullet from her new Covergirl Katy Kat Pearl Lipstick ($7; walgreens.com ). John Shearer/WireImage 10. Laverne Cox \nNow that's what we call some statement liner. In developing Cox's avant-garde eye makeup look, her makeup artist Deja Davenport presented the star with a few preliminary sketches. The duo ultimately decided on this rounded, sequin-adorned version, which was complemented by a high ponytail, classic nude lip, and ultra-sharp contour. Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic 11. Taraji P. Henson \nHenson kept her makeup pretty neutral—though it's worth mentioning that her perfectly-arched brows will forever give us envy—and wore her strands in a sleek, center-parted bob. \"Her lavender dress is playful and a bit futuristic, so I wanted to acknowledge that with her hairstyle with a fresh undercut to create something unique, but still achievable for women at home,\" explains her hairstylist Tymothe Wallace. He started by shampooing the star's hair, then followed with a few pumps of Dove Absolute Curls Supreme Creme Serum ($6; target.com ) from root to tip. He blow-dried her hair in section, and locked in a bone-straight texture with a few passes of the flat iron. Once a precise center part had been formed, Wallace applied another layer of the Absolute Curls Serum to amp up shine and tame any flyaways. \"Once her hair was smooth and straight, I added an excessive amount of black bobby pins to secure either side,\" he adds. \"I stacked and crossed them over one another to form a unique and playful design.\" Mission accomplished. A veil of the Dove Style + Care Flexible Hold Hairspray ($4; target.com ) topped off the look. Frazer Harrison/Getty Images 12. Demi Lovato \nDemi's complexion glowed just as bright as her gold beaded dress. After prepping her skin with Giorgio Armani Skincare, her pro Jill Powell used two shades of Giorgio Armani Beauty Power Fabric Longwear High Cover Foundation SPF 25 ($64; sephora.com ) to even her complexion followed by a duo of Giorgio Armani High Precision Retouch Concealer ($40; sephora.com ) and Master Corrector ($40; sephora.com ) on her under eyes. To contour, Powell brushed Giogrio Armani Beauty Sun Fabric Bronzer ($56; nordstrom.com ) on her forehead, cheeks, and sides of neck, and highlighted the singer's cheekbones with Giorgio Armani Beauty Chinese New Year Highlighting Palette ($88; giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com ). Demi's soft flush came from dusting Giorgio Armani Beauty's Cheek Fabric Sheer Blush in Dolci ($48; sephora.com ) on the apples of her cheeks. Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images 13. Paris Jackson \nTo create a balance between Paris Jackson sparkly Balmain jumpsuit, Rimmel London makeup artist Jo Baker kept the celebrity's makeup natural and subtle, relying on products like Rimmel London InstaFlawless Skin Tint ($7; target.com ) to give the skin a radiant glow and Rimmel London Insta Flawless Matte Setting Powder ($4; target.com )and Rimmel London Kate Sculpting & Highlighting Kit in Golden Sands ($7; target.com ) to contour. \nOf course, we can't fail to mention Jackson's enviable wavy bob, which featured an unexpected peek-a-book French braid on the side. John Shearer/WireImage 14. Camilla Cabello \nCamilla Cabello’s first solo Grammys appearance will go down in red carpet beauty history. She turned heads with voluminous beach waves, created by celebrity hairstylist Marcus Francis. Before blow-drying, Francis applied Suave Professionals Luxe Style Infusion Volumizing Soufflé Mousse ($5; walmart.com ) on her wet hair and R+Co Dallas Thickening Spray ($12; nordstrom.com ) on her roots. After it was dry, he used a curling iron to create waves and then finished off the look by running his hands through them and spritizing in some Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray ($46; net-a-porter.com ). \nPaired with full brows you couldn’t miss, a glossy pink pout, and a pastel pink manicure to match, it was an all-around win if we’ve ever seen one. Lester Cohen/WireImage 15. Lea Michele \nThough the star is usually one to wear a gorgeous set of faux lashes, Lea Michele switched it up for the 2017 Grammys, opting out of liner and mascara altogether. Instead, she teamed her sleek, side-parted layers with a pink monochromatic look with coordinating petal tones on her eyes, cheeks and lips.
