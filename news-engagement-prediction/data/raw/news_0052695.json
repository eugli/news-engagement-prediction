Daniel Mejia, a Chandler Police Department spokesman.\nHerrera initially was reported as a possible impaired driver by a bystander shortly after 1:45 p.m., Mejia said. A Chandler police officer tried to conduct a traffic stop on Herrera, who was driving a blue Chrysler sedan, on Arizona Avenue and Chandler Heights Road, Mejia said.\nThe officer watched the sedan speed southbound on Arizona Avenue approaching Chandler Heights, Mejia said.\nDuring the traffic stop, Herrera refused to roll down the window and backed into the police car, Mejia said. She then put the car in drive and drove toward the officer.\nAs the officer backed out of the way, he tripped on a raised concrete median and suffered minor injuries to his hand, Mejia said.\nThe vehicle headed east on Riggs Road at a high speed, and Maricopa County Sheriff's Office deputies located the sedan on Power Road just south of Riggs Road, Mejia said.\nThe woman refused to exit the vehicle, so Chandler officers broke a passenger-side window to unlock the doors and Herrera was taken into custody, Mejia said.\nA second officer suffered minor cuts while attempting to break the car window.\nHerrera was not impaired, Mejia said. He said the reasons behind the alleged actions were not immediately known.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:08:49.096+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
