Credit Carole Segal/Sci Fi Richard Hatch, a veteran actor known for his portrayal of a hotshot pilot on the 1970s science-fiction television series “Battlestar Galactica” and a political leader in a reboot of the series more than two decades later, died on Tuesday. He was 71. His death was confirmed by his son, Paul, who said in a statement that Mr. Hatch had pancreatic cancer and died in Los Angeles. Ronald D. Moore, a writer and producer of the second “Battlestar Galactica” series, said on Twitter that Mr. Hatch was “a good man, a gracious man, and a consummate professional” and called his death “a heavy blow to the entire BSG family.” Mr. Hatch played Captain Apollo, a fighter pilot who was regularly featured with his best friend, Lieutenant Starbuck, played by Dirk Benedict. The original series, which ran on ABC in 1978-79, told the story of humans fighting for survival against warrior robots called Cylons. In a reboot of the series, which was broadcast on the SyFy network for five seasons starting in 2004, he played the charismatic political leader Tom Zarek. Mr. Hatch — not to be confused with the winner of the first season of the “Survivor” reality television series, also named Richard Hatch — was nominated in 1979 for a Golden Globe Award for best actor in a television drama series. He appeared on several other television series in the 1970s, including “All My Children” (playing Philip Brent) and “The Streets of San Francisco” (playing Inspector Dan Robbins when Michael Douglas left the series in its fifth and final season). Richard L. Hatch was born on May 21, 1945, in Santa Monica, Calif. He began his career in Off Broadway theater before landing the role on “All My Children,” his family said. In addition to his son, he is survived by a brother, John.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:49:39.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
