The new grant will help fund innovative approaches to combat metastatic osteosarcoma. Recently funded studies at Morris Animal Foundation have zeroed in on ways to optimize chemotherapy selection, control pain, and find new therapeutic targets, all aimed at improving treatment outcomes.\n“The Petco Foundation, established in 1999, is focused on creating a better world for animals,” said Susanne Kogut, Executive Director of the Petco Foundation. “Osteosarcoma research holds the promise of improving treatment for dogs with this disease, giving them healthier lives and more time with the families that love them.”\nThe Blue Buffalo Foundation was established in 2003 with a specific focus on cancer research.\n“So many of us have lost beloved pets to this deadly disease, and we are committed to advancing science that will make a difference in the fight against pet cancer,” said David Petrie, President of the Blue Buffalo Foundation. “We are pleased to partner with Morris Animal Foundation to fund innovative studies that will not only help our companion animals survive cancer, but thrive and have good lives.”\nThe Petco Foundation and Blue Buffalo Foundation’s eighth annual Pet Cancer Awareness fundraising campaign takes place May 6 – May 28, 2017. Animal lovers and pet parents nationwide can help continue this important work by donating at any Petco store or at www.petco.com/pca . A portion of the funds will be donated to Morris Animal Foundation for ongoing research in osteosarcoma.\nAbout Morris Animal Foundation\nMorris Animal Foundation is a global leader in funding scientific studies that advance the health of companion animals, horses and wildlife.

(“Blue Buffalo”) a manufacturer of natural dog and cat foods under the BLUE™ brand names. Helping to find a cure for pet cancer is a top priority for Blue Buffalo because its founders have had very personal experience with this disease. “Our dog Blue, a large breed Airedale and a great pal, had three bouts with cancer,” said Bill Bishop, Blue Buffalo’s founder. “After Blue’s battles, we wanted to do something meaningful to help find a cure for this devastating disease. So one of the first things we did after starting our pet food company was to establish the Foundation to raise money for pet cancer research, and raise awareness among pet parents of the early warning signs of this disease.” www.PetCancerAwareness.org .\nAbout the Petco Foundation\nAt the Petco Foundation, we believe that every animal deserves to live its best life.
