Credit: PA \nThe BBC has ordered an urgent investigation into reports that enforcement officers had deliberately targeted vulnerable people and squeezed them for cash after they failed to pay for a TV licence. \nIt comes after a Daily Mail investigation claimed that outsourced workers at Capita had pursued a demented war veteran and a mother living in a refuge to hit targets for collection of unpaid fees. \n\"Greedy\" bosses at the private firm reportedly offer staff bonuses of up to £15,000 a year for meeting targets of catching at least 28 evaders per week. \nThey are also reportedly pushing staff to gather evidence to take non-payers to court. \nOne Capita boss allegedly told an undercover reporter who interviewed for a job: \"We will drive you as hard as we can to get as much as we can out of you because we're greedy.\" \nThe BBC said it had demanded an urgent investigation from Capita, which reportedly gets £58 million a year to collect licence fees for the broadcaster. \nWe are very disappointed by the conduct of Capita's interviewing managers in this particular case, which is not in line with the high standards we expect and does not reflect the policies in place. – BBC spokeswoman \n\"We have asked Capita to investigate urgently and ensure swift and appropriate action is taken.\" \nA spokeswoman said the firm is paid only for collecting licence fees, and not for prosecutions. \n\"We expect inquiry officers to behave in a courteous, professional manner and abide by a published code of conduct,\" she added. \nCapita bosses also face being called to Parliament to explain themselves to MPs, according to the Daily Mail. \nAnyone with a television or who watches iPlayerwithout a licence can be fined up to £1,000 and be given a criminal record. \nThe company told the Mail that its incentive scheme applied only to sales of licence fees, not the number of people officers interview so they can be taken to court.
