Unfazed by the crowd in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, he stripped to his boxer briefs and swung away. Perhaps the 35-year-old drew inspiration from Henrik Stenson, who did the same thing eight years ago. \"That's what I would do if I had that body,\" announcer David Feherty said. Stefani's bold move ended with a bogey, and he missed the weekend cut with a two-over tally.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T22:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:30:57.574+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
