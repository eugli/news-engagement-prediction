Not only will it be the last time Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine, but following in Deadpool's footsteps, it will also be the clawed mutant's first R-rated adventure. We already have a pretty good idea of what to expect from Logan thanks to a basic plot synopsis, reports and two trailers, but with only a month left until the movie's release, some new information has been revealed. \nThe Berlin International Film Festival dropped an extended plot synopsis for Logan , and here are the four most important details it revealed. Let's start with the group that took the eponymous protagonist in all those years ago. The X-Men Have Disbanded \nGiven that Logan is the third Wolverine spinoff, it was obvious from the start that the entire X-Men team wasn't going to be involved in the movie. However, the trailers have indicated that the team isn't even around anymore, and sure enough, it's been confirmed that they disbanded sometime after X-Men: Days of Future Past . The synopsis doesn't provide a reason for why they're no longer together, but it's possible it may have to do with the shrinking mutant population across the world. On the other hand, those of you who have read the Old Man Logan comic book story know that the mutant superheroes experienced a horrible fate (no spoilers here), so perhaps something similar has happened in the movie universe.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:33:25.403+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
