After all of this time, he has at last completed this lofty goal. \nAccording to Kotaku , all of this started when Kusielczuk’s friend jokingly suggested he undertake the challenge. Kusielczuk decided to actually go through with it and began his journey in 2014. Over the weekend, he completed Super Mario Bros. 3 , which was the 714th and final game. To celebrate, Kusielczuk played his guitar and sang. He also recapped his ten favorite moments from the 3,000+ hours it took him to finish all of these titles. Congrats to @TheMexicanRuner on beating ALL 714 NES GAMES with a time or 3435:12:24 – PB HYPE! – The 1st person in HISTORY to do so! pic.twitter.com/f7UEafy7IN \n— Big Jon @ Home (@BigJon06) February 26, 2017 \nSuper Mario Bros. 3 was one of the shorter games Kusielczuk played. Other titles like Miracle Piano Teaching System (yes, that is the name of a real game) took considerably longer. The 714 NES games include every title released in North America and 35 PAL-exclusive titles. As far as pure numbers go, this endeavor took 206,112 minutes and over 900 days. \nKusielczuk has speedrun records for both Battletoads and Contra . During the NESMania Quest , however, it wasn’t about finishing the games quickly — it was about just beating them. Kusielczuk has managed to accomplish something that few can claim. There is little doubt that others will attempt to best The Mexican Runner now that the challenge is out there. Seeing how long it took Kusielczuk to play all of these games, it is doubtful we’ll see anyone match or beat him for some time.
