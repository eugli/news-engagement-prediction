If its India box office numbers have been monumental, its run in Pakistan is simply inspirational. It was the first film to release after the ban on Indian films was lifted in our neighbouring country and it seems audience there is loving it. Over the weekend, Hrithik Roshan ‘s revenge drama has earned Rs. 2 crore. \nKaabil earned Rs. 75 lakh on the first day which was simply great given the fact that the film was released there without any publicity campaign as it was a sudden development. We told you how there were reports of Dangal, Kaabil and Raees to hit the theatres post the ban. But Kaabil became the first one to get a go ahead and a simultaneous release. In fact, the film brought people back to the theatres. Kaabil released in Karachi last week at 11 pm and saw a wide release in Karachi, Islamabad, Rawal Pindi and Hyderabad. People loved the film there and have been tweeting about it a lot in last few days. Pakistan theatre owners are happy that Indian films are releasing there because the ban had affected their business a lot.

I’m sure this is a healthy beginning. In Pakistan, over 50 per cent decline in revenue collection was witnessed after Indian films were withdrawn from the theatres.” And he is right. Kaabil’s numbers are certainly saying that the film got much love in Pakistan. \nStay tuned for more box office updates on Kaabil.
