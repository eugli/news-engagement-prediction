In last six months, over 12 cars have been stolen from the Gujarat 's Ahmedabad district, Police said. \n\n\"The city-based gang of carjackers prefer small cars. Actually, those cars which could easily be modified and re-sold as taxis to dealers in neighbouring states,\" a senior police officer said. \n\nHe also said that Hyundai's Santro has become most desirable car for the thieves as its production have been stopped in 2008 and as such cannot be detected easily. \n\nThe gang used to convert the cars into taxis as they are not checked that thoroughly during checkpoints. They would change the colour, number plates and even the chassis numbers to avoid detection, Police said. \n\n\"Duplicate papers were the final icing on the cake, which made unsuspecting buyers purchase the cars easily,\" said a police officer. \n\nIn 2013, Mumbai police has caught a gang of carjackers who had sold vehicles stolen from Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh . The gang used to steal cars using a master key. The cars were painted, dented and modified before being sold to taxi operators in Mumbai. \n\nRead this story in Gujarati", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T10:24:13.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
