It sports a 2.0-litre TDI engine mated to a seven-speed DSG gearbox. The dimensions of the Tiguan -- 4486 mm length,1839 mm width and 1646 mm height -- make it identical to the Audi Q3, its sibling from the Volkswagen Group family. Both the cars have a ground clearance of 170 mm. \nTiguan sports the same engine as the Q3, but is likely to be tuned to 190PS for more power and 400Nm for more twist. Taking cues from that, the Tiguan base model could come at Rs 25 lakh and a top-end all-wheel drive variant could ask for up to Rs 35 lakh. \n“Tiguan as our first premium SUV, comes into an area where we see more and more people investing into such cars. That will be the first step for us into that domain of SUVs,” Michael Mayer, Volkswagen Group sales India director, VW passenger cars, told PTI. \nLaunch expected by mid-2017. Passat has been a decent seller for Volkswagen. The update would come with nine airbags, for the first time. (Handout photo) \nThe 2017 edition of Passat will be powered with a 2.0-litre TDI engine mated to a six-speed DSG gearbox. Seeing how India is adopting safer cars, Volkswagen will offer nine airbags for the first time in Passat for additional passenger safety. \nThe outgoing version of the Passat came was launched in 2011 at Rs 20.80 lakh, and 2.0-litre TDI engine then churned out 170 bhp and 350 Nm torque. The technicalities of the car may not changed, and the price may start at Rs 23 lakh. \nThe new Passat will take on the Skoda Superb, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry, in the same price bracket. The GTI’s four-cylinder TSI turbocharged engine when mated to a seven-speed automatic DSG transmission generates 192 PS power and 320 Nm torque. (Handout photo) \nVolkswagen had launched the 1.8-litre GTI in November at Rs 25.99 lakh (ex-showroom, New Delhi). The GTIis essentially a three-doored Polo that reaches 0 to 100 in 6.7 seconds and can clock a top-speed of 235 kmph. \nIts four-cylinder TSI turbocharged engine mated to a seven-speed automatic DSG transmission sends 320 Nm torque to the wheels and roars out 192PS power. \nWorld’s largest carmaker in 2016, Volkswagen Group AG has been treading carefully and conserving resources amid a turmoil in EU and the US over the emissions scandal. The carmaker was also reported to be in talks with Tata Motors for a partnership to co-develop cars by sharing vehicle architecture and technology. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:14:37.386+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
