Photo: Thierry Charlier/AFP/Getty Images Hours after Russian president Vladimir Putin called for greater cooperation with the United States and other Western countries in the fight against terrorism, Defense Secretary Jim “Mad Dog” Mattis said it’s not happening. Not now, at least.\n“We’ll engage politically; we’re not in a position right now to collaborate on a military level,” Mattis said at a NATO meeting in Brussels . He added that Russia must “live by international law” and will have to “prove itself” before the U.S. military will work alongside Russia’s.\nEarlier Thursday in Moscow, Putin said , “It’s in the general interest to establish a dialogue with the special services of the United States and other member countries of NATO.” He also said Russia needs to “establish cooperation at a new level in the anti-terrorist sphere with foreign partners.”\nMattis’s very public denial of Putin’s request stands in contrast to comments made by President Trump, who repeatedly said on the campaign trail that the U.S. and Russia could potentially work together in the fight against ISIS. When Trump and Putin spoke on the phone in January, they discussed the possibility, according to the White House .\nOne topic Trump and Putin did not discuss on that phone call, at least according to the White House’s readout, is Russia’s habit of attempting to influence foreign elections. Mattis, however, did bring it up in his speech Thursday. “There’s very little doubt that they have either interfered or they’ve attempted to interfere in a number of elections in democracies,” he said. Mattis did not, however, mention the most recent U.S. election.\nTags: james mattis vladimir putin russia president trump international affairs Mattis: Russia Must ‘Prove Itself’ Before Working with U.S. Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories More White House Chaos Over Anti-Immigrant Policy Draft Paul Ryan’s Dream of Tax Cuts for the Rich Will Not Be Denied Andrew Sullivan: The White House Mole Most Viewed Stories The White House Mole Psychologists Think They Found the Purpose of Depression Jared Kushner Takes Trump’s Complaints About CNN to Time Warner Executive Former Obama White House Photographer’s Instagram Is a Master Class in Shade Trump Ends the Presidential Press Conference As We Know It Why Your Dog’s Personality Is a Lot Like Yours Donald Trump Thinks He’s Good at Being President Melania Trump Is Reportedly ‘Miserable’ in Her Role As First Lady The Great Wall Is Wonderfully Ridiculous Trump Somehow Found a Way to Insult Women at the Unveiling of an Airplane Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Wildest Moments From Donald Trump’s Press Conference Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 29 mins ago Upper East Side Parents Are the Latest Trump Resisters An elite boarding school allegedly had to cancel a field trip to the Central Park’s Trump-affiliated Wollman Rink.\n4:10 p.m. More White House Chaos Over Anti-Immigrant Policy Draft The Associated Press has a draft of a memo that suggests deploying as many as 100,000 National Guard troops.\n3:19 p.m. Senate Confirms Leading Opponent of Environmental Regulation As Head of the EPA Scott Pruitt will spearhead the Trump administration’s efforts to increase water pollution and accelerate man-made climate change.\n2:54 p.m. R.I.P.
