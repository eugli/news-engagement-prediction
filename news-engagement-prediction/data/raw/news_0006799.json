Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThis is smiling surgeon Naseer Ahmad leaving court after he escaped his SECOND driving ban - arguing that being forced to get the bus would put patients’ lives at risk. \nNaseer Ahmad, 42, had already been escaped a driving ban last year under the totting up procedure after claiming he needed his car to get to hospitals quickly for life saving operations. \nBut just months later he was caught driving his Mercedes at 68mph on a 50mph stretch of the M60 motorway near Manchester - so the consultant vascular surgeon Ahmad used his family instead to argue 'exceptional hardship'. \nDespite already having 12 points on his licence Ahmad - also a school governor - said disqualification would mean him having to get the bus to work and could cost him his job leaving him unemployed with a wife who only 'occasionally works as a pharmacist'.

He was also fined £900 with £170 in costs and surcharges which he will pay back at £80 per month. Afterwards the doctor was seen with a beaming smile outside the courthouse, \nThe court heard Ahmad had originally been hauled before JPs on February 29 last year having been caught speeding three times at a time when he already had three points on his licence.

He was allowed to keep his licence but the following May 15 was caught speeding at 7.15am on the M60 between junction eight and junction ten. Ahmad is based at Manchester Royal Infirmary, but says he is expected to be at any hospital in Greater Manchester within 30 minutes (Photo: Matt Ratcliffe) \nMike Arden, prosecuting said: “The defendant was driving a Mercedes vehicle at 68mph where the limit was 50mph. I’m aware he’s made an argument before and it was accepted and now he’s making another argument. \n“He was before court on February 29 2016 for three times speeding, and had another already on his licence, which made four, which made 12 points, which meant his licence could be disqualified. He made representations for hardship, last time it was for others - but this time it’s for himself.” \nUnder legal rules the same representations for exceptional hardship cannot be put forward twice. \nBut Ahmad told the court he is expected to be within 30 minutes of any hospitals in the Greater Manchester when he is on call and is required to ‘complete amputations, save limbs and save lives’.

In relation to my employment I cover a number of hospitals in the Greater Manchester area. If I was not able to drive I would have to get public transport. Getting from Bolton to Salford in 45 minutes by car so I think that would be quite difficult. \n“Over a period of six months I would not be able to fulfil my present obligations. My waiting list is about four months and that would easily go to 12 months. My on-call duties involve emergency saviour of life or limb, or operating on those conditions. \n“Last week I was called to a stabbing and was also asked to remove a bullet from someone shot in the neck. I treat children as well and a couple of ruptured aneurysms. When I’m on-call I’m on-call for 63 hours. I start at Friday 5pm and finish on Monday at 8am, it’s all weekend. Ahmad says he struggled to get to Salford Royal, when he was called in to help the surgeon dealing with a woman who had been hit by a car (Photo: MANCHESTER EVENING NEWS) \n“On May 15 when I was on the M60 it was a kid that had a fracture. It was quite a common injury and occurs in kids aged three to eight. \n“In about ten cases a year I get called in to try and improve the blood supply to the arm or the hand will become ischaemic. There is about one a month. \n“Time is of the essence, once the hand is ischeamic that hand is dying so you’re trying to get the blood supply back. \n“About two months ago I was at hospital and was called from another site in relation someone in theatre at the time. This call came through at about 3pm. \n“There was a lady at Salford Royal who had been struck by a car and she was in theatre and the general surgeon opened up the chest and couldn’t get control of the blood pressure, he couldn’t work out what was going on.

I went down to A&E to try and get an ambulance to take me over. The ambulance control said no. \n“We then went to the police and they said no. I grabbed the phone and said ‘this patient is going to die’. We went in an ambulance in the end and said that the policy needs to be sorted out. \n“If I was to lose my employment the consequences to me personally would be all the usual stuff, paying the mortgage and bills, paying for the kids. I would not be able to fulfil the commitments. All work within the country requires having a car to go around the country to be able to work. I’m married and have three children aged 15, 13 and 12. Ahmad was told he has to be 'very careful in future' \n“My wife doesn’t work, she occasionally works as a pharmacist but she’s mainly with the children with the work hours that I do. I don’t have any savings.” \nHis counsel Patrick Williamson said: “The defendant has taken steps to not have any further incidents of speeding and put the priority of road safety above everything else and unfortunately that’s led to the loss of one life. \n“He took further time and a patient suffered a heart attack. The defendant and other doctors are not only trying to travel to the hospitals but then are being given parking fines when they get to the hospital to work on people. \n“They need to try and get to hospital as quickly and safely as possible. On-call he can be asked to come and requires completing amputations, saving limbs and saving lives. He was called out to perform an operation.

You need to be very careful in the future because you will struggle to have any reasonable excuse.” \nAccording to his LinkedIn page, Ahmad started as the sixth consultant vascular surgeon at the MRI in 2015. He specialises in diabetic foot surgery and is lead for diabetic surgery in Salford Royal Infirmary. He has previously offered his services in earthquake zones and is governor at Whalley Range High School in Manchester.
