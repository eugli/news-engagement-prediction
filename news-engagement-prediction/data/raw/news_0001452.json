That’s why there are fines for it. If we go over the top, then give us a fine. It’s right that we should pay the penalty. \n\"Managers are not by nature the kind of people who want to have a go at the referee.Do you think Arsene Wenger is a person who, when he sees the fourth official, wants to punch him? That’s not how he is and everybody knows it. \n\"It happens because of the circumstances, not because of the personality. Pressure even makes the likes of mild-mannered Wenger act out, says Klopp (Photo: REUTERS) \n\"Sometimes you can’t control yourself and you say things like, 'Nobody can beat us.’ I have never heard a more silly sentence, given that we’d lost the three previous matches. \n\"And as for how I looked when saying it... I was lucky in the way the fourth official reacted and I hope he didn’t get into trouble because of it. His was the reaction of a human being.” \nJose Mourinho claims ­Swarbrick’s leniency towards Klopp smacks of double standards, the Manchester United boss arguing that officials take a much tougher line with him. Klopp knows his \"Nobody can beat us!\" dig was daft considering recent results (Photo: Liverpool FC via Getty) \nKlopp is baffled by Mourinho’s latest dig at him, but says he does not have time to question the motives behind it. \nThe German claimed that, while he enjoyed chatting to Chelsea boss Antonio Conte before and after Tuesday’s game, he is too busy to build a relationship with Mourinho. \n“Honestly, I have no time to think about things like this,” he said. “Why are we talking about other managers? If you want a positive story, I talked 10 minutes before the game to Antonio Conte and 10 minutes after the game to him and it was really interesting.

Pep Guardiola? We are not friends but we know each other, so we talk when we meet. \n“But you cannot have relationships like this with all managers. And if I don’t have one, there is not time to start having one.” \nMourinho’s comments were backed up by former ref Dermot Gallagher, who said Klopp should have been censured. \n“What Klopp did on Tuesday was unacceptable,” said Gallagher. “It was something that had to be dealt with and it wasn’t dealt with. Klopp should have been removed, without doubt.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:09:12.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
