Neither side would divulge the amount of the settlement, though Trump's lawyer Charles Harder called it a \"substantial sum.\" \nTrump, who is married to U.S. President Donald Trump, filed the lawsuit last year against both Tarpley and the Daily Mail, a British tabloid, after the newspaper published an article that falsely alleged she had worked for an escort service. \nThe article cited a Slovenian magazine's report that a modelling agency with which Trump worked in New York in the 1990s also served as an escort business. \nThe Daily Mail published a retraction and apology after the lawsuit was filed, saying in a statement it had not intended to state or suggest that Trump had worked as an escort. \nLast week, a Maryland judge dismissed the claims against the Daily Mail on jurisdictional grounds while allowing the lawsuit to continue against Tarpley. The settlement ends that case. \nOn Monday, Trump filed a new $150 million lawsuit against Mail Media, the Daily Mail's owner, in New York state court, claiming the article had cost her millions of dollars in potential business. \nTrump had a \"unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to launch numerous product lines, including jewellery, apparel, shoes and cosmetics at a time when she is \"one of the most photographed women in the world,\" according to the new lawsuit. \nA spokesman for the Daily Mail did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. \nHarder, Trump's lawyer, has represented several celebrities and won a $140 million invasion of privacy verdict for wrestler Hulk Hogan against the now-defunct Gawker last year. \nTrump, a native of Slovenia, moved to the United States in the 1990s and in 2005 married Donald Trump, who entered the White House on Jan. 20. \n(Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Daniel Wallis and Howard Goller) First Lady Melania Trump and U.S. President Donald Trump (not pictured) attend the 60th Annual Red Cross Gala at Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., February 4, 2017.
