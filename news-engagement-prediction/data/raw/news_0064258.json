The agency dismissed the complaint because it found that Lukacs had no private or public standing in the matter because he wasn’t directly affected by it. \nThe federal appeal court disagreed in a ruling last September and ordered the agency to take another look at Delta’s policy. \nLukacs said Thursday he was disappointed the top court had granted the leave to appeal, but said it might provide some needed clarity to the issue. \nWATCH: A Halifax man who advocates for airline passenger rights is taking on Delta Air Lines, saying passengers who travel on its flights out of Canada are being discriminated because they’re obese. Ross Lord explains. \n“This protracts the process of dealing with the substance of my complaint, which is whether this policy is discriminatory,” he said. “But at the same time, I’m very pleased that the Supreme Court recognizes that this is a matter of national importance and that finally there will be some legal certainty created here.” \nDelta said Thursday it is also glad the top court will “decide this issue.” \n“Delta is pleased the Supreme Court has accepted our appeal because the issue before the court about what the requirements are to bring claims to the Canadian Transportation Agency is important to our industry,” Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said in a statement. \nIn an email, Durrant added that Delta’s web site continues to offer “guidance … to customers of size.” It suggests they ask to be moved next to an empty seat, or upgrading to business or first class, if they can’t sit in their seat without encroaching on their neighbour. \nIn its earlier decision, the federal appeal court unanimously agreed that the fact that someone may not be directly affected by a practice should not prevent them from filing a complaint. \n“There is no sound reason to limit standing … to those with a direct, personal interest in the matter.” \nWhile the decision addressed a particular case, Lukacs said it could open the door to more people being able to file complaints with the agency – a quasi-judicial tribunal mandated to provide consumer protection for air passengers and ensure accessible transportation. \nThe complaint stemmed from a 2014 email from a Delta customer care agent to a passenger who felt he was “cramped” on a flight by a large passenger. The passenger notified Delta, which provided him with an explanation of the airline’s guidelines. \nDelta said it sometimes asks large passengers to move to an area of the plane where there is more room, “purchase additional seats” or take another flight. \nLukacs had argued that dismissing his complaint simply because the issue didn’t affect him personally was akin to disregarding someone’s concerns over contaminated food just because they weren’t made sick by it. \nAs usual, the Supreme Court gave no reasons for deciding to hear the case, saying only that the leave to appeal was granted without costs. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T12:41:41.246+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
