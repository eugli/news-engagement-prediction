(Photo: Gerry Broome, AP) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nIf you pull out a calendar, Gene Chizik can provide a pretty good guesstimate of his schedule for any date. For 30 years, it’s been set to the grinding rhythm of college football coaching. \n“I can tell you year-round what I’d be doing, to the day,” Chizik says. \nWhich is why the last week has been a fantastic shock to the system. \nEarlier this month Chizik announced his resignation from his position as North Carolina’s defensive coordinator, citing a desire to spend more time with his family. After wrapping up a few loose ends, he moved home to Auburn, Ala., and officially launched into unemployment last Monday. \nInstead of — well, let’s see, he’d have been watching video of third-and-long, reviewing the 2016 season in order to prepare for spring practice — Chizik awakened each day without an agenda. He went for long walks. He worked out. He went to breakfast with his daughters, and then had lunch with them, too. He played with their 2½-year-old foster child. \nMORE COLLEGE FOOTBALL Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield arrested in Arkansas \nLast Monday he watched his son’s first high school baseball game of the season. Last Thursday afternoon, he and his wife Jonna spent time picking out outdoor furniture for the house they’ve recently built. Yeah, it feels weird to him, too. \n“It’s an interesting dynamic,” Chizik says, “to wake up in the morning and not feel the stress that never ends.” \nThe move is unusual, at least at the highest levels of college football. Chizik won the 2010 BCS national championship as Auburn’s head coach but was fired two years later and spent two years out of the business. But this time he left the game on his own terms. \nAfter months of conversations and prayer, Chizik says it came down simply to this: He spent his coaching career trying to mentor boys to become men, and telling them family came first. Now he wanted to do the same with his son, and to show him family was more important than football. \n“It was time for me to walk the walk,” Chizik says. \nAnd that meant quitting the business and moving home — which is Auburn, Ala. \nWhen Chizik became Auburn’s head coach in 2008, moving from Iowa State, he and his wife Jonna promised their children — twin daughters Landry and Kennedy and son Cally — who were moving for the fourth time, “This is your last move.” \nThe hope, of course, was that Chizik would settle in for a long run on the Plains. But in 2012, just two years after winning it all, Chizik was fired after the Tigers went 3-9 in 2012. Still, they remained in Auburn. Gene worked in TV and radio, but he still had the itch to coach. \nTwo years later, when he took the job at North Carolina, they discussed moving but decided the family would stay behind at least until the twins finished high school. So dad moved. The family regularly visited Chapel Hill, N.C. He occasionally visited Auburn, flying in whenever possible — which wasn’t all that often — for long weekends. \nThe long-distance relationship was difficult. In a letter explaining his resignation to North Carolina fans, Chizik noted that he “missed my twin daughters’ entire senior year of high school,” and that he’d only seen two of Cally’s baseball and two football games. Landry and Kennedy are now freshmen at Auburn. But those initial tentative plans to move changed; Cally, a high-school sophomore, had lived in Auburn since the second grade and didn’t want to leave. \n“As every parent can imagine,” he wrote in the letter , “being a long-distance dad to my children has been extremely difficult on everyone.” \nEven before the move to North Carolina, he and Jonna had talked about how the typical coaching lifestyle, even when living in the same house, made it difficult to find a semblance of balance. Almost every day, Gene was up and off to work before the rest of the household and typically returned long after the others had gone to bed. And during those times when they were together, football still retained a firm grip on his focus. The challenge, Jonna says, was always “to be present when you’re present.” \nHis absence the last two years was never more evident than last August. As a sophomore, Cally was practicing as a first-team cornerback at Auburn High when he took a hard hit and cracked a vertebra. It was, both Gene and Jonna say, “scary.” And even though it was quickly apparent the injury would fully heal in a few months — Cally returned to play late in the season — it highlighted the imperfection of the Chiziks’ family arrangement. \nGene Chizik in his office at Auburn in 2011, following the championship season. (Photo: Todd J. Van Emst, AP) \n“I wasn’t there,” Gene says. “Football’s really important to him and he virtually missed the whole year. It got me to thinking: What is the most important thing?” \nSays Jonna: “It was a tipping point, for sure.” \nBut if the injury and its aftermath only amplified the couple’s ongoing discussions about what was best, and even though the family is financially secure — he made $3.5 million in his final year at Auburn, and received a $7.5 million buyout when he was fired — leaving behind football still wasn’t an easy decision. \n“When you do something for 30 years and decide you’re gonna step away, it isn’t just a moment when you go, ‘OK, I’m tired of this,’ ” Gene says. “It’s what you do. It’s what, on a daily basis, your life becomes and revolves around is your job. \n“To step away from that is a tall order because it’s just what you know. But for me, the decision was all about my family. All about my son, about getting some more time with my daughters. It was about being home together again with my wife.” \nHe arrived last week. On the first day of the rest of his life — maybe, we’ll see, but at least for now — Chizik watched Cally’s first high school baseball game of the season. He doesn’t plan to miss many more. Later in the week, he attended a meeting for the parents of Auburn High football players. \n“It was really kind of neat, to be honest with you,” he says, and he half-jokes that the new role of involved parent means it might not be long before Cally’s dad is grilling hamburgers for other fans. \n“I can’t wait to see what that looks like,” Jonna says, “Coach Chizik in the concession stand.” \nThe point is, he’ll be there. Jonna says she’s heard from other coaches’ wives — Gene has heard from fellow coaches — applauding the move and wishing they could do the same. But she’s most excited about what coming home has meant at home. \n“It has made a profound difference in our son’s world, that (Gene) chose his son,” Jonna says. “It’s a huge, huge statement to any child: ‘I’m willing to step away, I’m willing to focus on you.’” \nWhat happens in two years, when Cally graduates? No one’s sure. Gene is 55. He plans to fill some of his time studying football — it will come in handy if TV and radio opportunities arise again. He’s certain that, if he wants, he can return to coaching. But he’s not sure he will. \n“Never say never,” Jonna says. “But he’s stepping away with the idea of retiring. What the future looks like, I don’t know. … But he left with the idea that this could be it.” \nAfter two years absence, Gene Chizik’s only plan for at least the next two years is to be more present than he’s ever been. \nPROJECTING THE PRESEASON TOP 25 Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 1. Florida State: The Seminoles stumbled out of the gate this past season before hitting another gear following a loss to Clemson in October. With valuable experience under their belt and as much talent as any team in the country, Florida State is the team to beat in the Atlantic Coast Conference and very deserving of the title of preseason No. 1 in August. Steve Mitchell, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 2. Alabama: Personnel hits are coming, but that’s never derailed Alabama in the past. Quarterback Jalen Hurts will be even better, the offense should be more focused on the running game with a new coordinator and the defense will again rank among the nation’s best. Take note: Alabama and FSU meet in the opener. Brett Davis, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 3. Ohio State: Like the Crimson Tide, the Buckeyes will need to reload after losing several underclassmen to the NFL draft. But there will be far fewer losses this offseason than a year ago, so look for Ohio State to be loaded with talent and experience, not to mention more streamlined and less predictable on offense after some staffing changes. Rich Barnes, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 4. Michigan: The Wolverines will be right on the Buckeyes’ heels, as they were in 2016 — and as will be the case for as long as Jim Harbaugh and Urban Meyer are in charge. There is too much to like about Michigan to list here, but begin with the major assets: a wonderful defense despite a few losses in the back seven, a physical and punishing brand of offense, and a sense of unfinished business after two painful losses to end this year. Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 5. Washington: Reaching the Peach Bowl showed Washington’s growth, though the loss to Alabama revealed the distance still to travel before the Huskies can win a national championship. Considering Chris Petersen’s history, the 2017 team could be better than this year’s version, even if there will be a number of personnel issues to address as a result of early departures. The Huskies will be the preseason favorites in the Pac-12 and a strong contender for the Playoff. Jennifer Buchanan, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 6. Oklahoma: The Sooners obviously must improve on defense after a sluggish season, but there’s reason for optimism. Given the likely production of the Baker Mayfield-led offense, OU is simply a defense away from taking the Big 12 and returning to the Playoff. The Sooners have enormous expectations but slightly more question marks than the five teams listed above. Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 7. USC: Let the hype begin for USC and its superb quarterback Sam Darnold, who will begin his sophomore season at or near the top of every Heisman Trophy list. The question: Are the Trojans ready to take the next step? The ability and athleticism are there, but the potential departure of several NFL-ready underclassmen bears watching. Gary A. Vasquez, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 8. Penn State: The Nittany Lions’ biggest post-regular season development was offensive coordinator Joe Moorhead’s decision to return in 2017. That, along with the return of quarterback Trace McSorley and running back Saquon Barkley, will ensure this offseason will be even better next season. Recapturing this year’s magic won’t be easy, but there’s zero reason to think Penn State is poised to take any step back. Marc Lebryk, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 9. Clemson: Clemson is among the most intriguing teams in college football entering next season. Deshaun Watson won’t be around, and that alone is reason to think the Tigers will begin the year pegged to finish behind Florida State. But this program recruits an elite level, has an outstanding defensive line, should get improved play on the offensive line and has earned the benefit of the doubt. Still, there will be major weapons to replace on offense and key leaders to replace on defense. This may nonetheless be too low a ranking for Clemson. Joshua S. Kelly, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 10. Oklahoma State: To call Oklahoma State a sleeper ignores the fact that this program has been in the national picture for the better part of the decade. But there seems to be something overlooked about the Cowboys, who return the heart of their offense and have enough coming back on defense to be right alongside or just behind Oklahoma on the Big 12 ladder. Kevin Jairaj, USA TODAY Sports 11. LSU: The Tigers’ impressive bowl win against Louisville provided some early validation for Ed Orgeron. How far LSU goes hinges almost entirely on how quickly new coordinator Matt Canada can turn around the offense. Jonathan Dyer, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 12. Wisconsin: Any doubts of Wisconsin’s ability to remain a national presence should be dismissed after another banner year for Paul Chryst and the Badgers. UW will be just behind the top three of Ohio State, Michigan and Penn State in the Big Ten. Thomas J. Russo, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 13. Virginia Tech: In what was supposed to be a building year, Justin Fuente led the Hokies to a divisional title and 10 wins. The future will be even better, beginning with a 2017 team that should repeat atop the ACC Coastal Division. Jim Dedmon, Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 14. Auburn: This is the most intriguing team in the SEC and perhaps in all of college football. Auburn is often hit or miss, but the addition of Baylor transfer Jarrett Stidham should kick the Tigers’ offense into a different gear. But will that be enough? Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 15. Stanford: Replacing Christian McCaffrey and finding better quarterback play are the Cardinal’s most pressing questions entering the offseason. This might not be a perfect team, but trust in David Shaw and his staff to pilot Stanford to another season spent in the thick of the Pac-12 and Rose Bowl hunt. Ivan Pierre Aguirre, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 16. Boise State: The top-ranked team from the Group of Five ranks will again be a favorite for double-digit wins during the regular season. Look for quarterback Brett Rypien to take another step forward and become a top-10 player at his position nationally. Matt Kartozian, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 17. Georgia: The SEC East Division will be a toss-up, with Georgia and two other teams soon to appear on this battling for a shot at the conference title. The Bulldogs seem the most likely to take another step forward thanks to quarterback Jacob Eason’s development and the arrival of an outstanding recruiting class. Justin Ford, USA TODAY Sports 18. Tennessee: But the Volunteers aren’t far behind. Much depends on finding a capable successor to quarterback Josh Dobbs and locating the sort of consistency needed to go from top-25 team to Playoff contender. Christopher Hanewinckel, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 19. Louisville: There’s always reining Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, but Louisville’s late swoon raises the issue of whether this team is about more than just a sublime quarterback and offense. While still very much a threat in the ACC, the Cardinals should be placed behind FSU and Clemson in the Atlantic Division. Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 20. South Florida: Adding a defense-first coach in Charlie Strong to an impressive offense will keep USF in the mix for 10-plus wins and a New Year’s Six bowl in 2017. There are several strong contenders in the American Athletic Conference, but the Bulls are the preseason favorite. Shanna Lockwood, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 21. Utah: Pegging the Utes for a national ranking seems like a safe bet. Whether Utah can do more – such as knock off USC and win the South Division – remains a question, however, particularly with losses at running back, wide receiver and the defensive line. Kelley L Cox, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 22. Florida: It all comes down to the offense, and whether the Gators’ attack can finally find some momentum under Jim McElwain and produce at the rate needed to compete for a Playoff berth. That’s still a concern entering McElwain’s third season in charge. Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 23. West Virginia: There will be a new quarterback and a different look on defense, especially in the secondary. The Mountaineers are still a threat for a top-three finish in the Big 12 after what may very well be a breakthrough season for Dana Holgorsen. Logan Bowles, USA TODAY Sports Fullscreen 24. Texas: Does Texas have the same potential as Tom Herman’s first team at Houston, which went 13-1 and won the Peach Bowl? Maybe, but probably not. This team won’t win the Big 12, but a change in culture and a huge uptick in production on offense should find the Longhorns at eight or nine wins in 2017. Brendan Maloney, USA TODAY Sports 25. UCLA: It almost never pays to have faith in Jim Mora and UCLA, but years of strong recruiting and a healthy Josh Rosen under center should yield a nice rebound after a horrific 2016 season. Mark J.
