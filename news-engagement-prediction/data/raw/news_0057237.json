Jay Cutler (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 7:17 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 7:17 p.m. ET \nJay Cutler's time with the Bears could be coming to an end. \nWhen Cutler signed a seven-year, $126 million contract following the 2012 season, $38 million was fully guaranteed. The Bears have fulfilled that obligation and now hope to unload the interception-prone quarterback on another team, according to ESPN.com . \nMORE: Bears coach John Fox won't commit to Cutler \nThe remaining four years on Cutler's contract are worth $74.7 million, but none of that money is guaranteed. Cutler also does not have a no-trade clause in his contract, but it still won't be easy to find a trade partner. Cutler could decide to sit out or even retire, ESPN's Jeff Darlington reported . \nBecause Cutler did not get a signing bonus when he re-upped with the Bears in 2013, he would not owe his potential new team any money should he decide to not play. \nCutler was a first-round pick of the Broncos in 2006, but traded to the Bears following his only Pro Bowl season in 2008. After throwing for a career-high 4,526 yards with 25 touchdowns and 18 interceptions, he threw for 3,666 with 27 touchdowns in his first season with the Bears. But he also led the NFL with 26 interceptions in 2009, which was the only year in which he played all 16 games in a season. \nCutler has been marred by various injuries during his eight seasons with the Bears. A shoulder injury last season limited him to just five games. Cutler also led the NFL in interceptions in 2014 with 18 picks thrown in 15 games. \nCutler has thrown for 32,467 yards over his career with 208 touchdowns and 146 interceptions. He has 154 TD passes and 109 picks with the Bears, who are 51-51 in games started by Cutler. \nThe Bears have just one playoff appearance since acquiring Cutler, losing to the rival Packers in the 2010 NFC championship game. \nSome of Cutler's worst games have been against Chicago's arch rival. \nCutler has thrown 16 touchdown passes and 22 interceptions while completing just 56 percent of his passes in 13 career games against the Packers. The Bears have won just two of those games. The Packers, conversely have reached the playoffs in every season since Cutler joined the division, winning the NFC North five times and the Super Bowl after beating the Bears in that 2010 NFC title game.
