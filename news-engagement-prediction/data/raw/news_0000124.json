He immediately noted that Elliott was not even one of their highest-ranked signees in the Class of 2013, checking in at 109th on ESPN’s rankings. (Meyer actually recalled him being 108th on 247Sports; his memory of the details was admirable but just a tad bit off.) \nYou can listen to the interview with Meyer here: \nElliott was no slouch, mind you, a four-star prospect out of St. Louis with plenty of interest. But among Ohio State’s offensive skill guys that year, Elliott checked in lower than Jalin Marshall and Dontre Wilson. \n“Zeke Elliot was a product of hard work,” said Meyer. “He was a made player, he didn’t show up like that and his work ethic is still legendary around here.” \nMeyer signed yet another stocked class Wednesday, arguably his best one yet at Ohio State. While second to Alabama’s on most recruiting sites, the Buckeyes’ class is smaller (21 signees) and higher on a per-player basis. Nearly a quarter (five) are five-star players. \nNone may be more important than five-star cornerback Jeffrey Okudah (Grand Prairie, Texas), the nation’s No. 7 overall recruit per 247Sports and one of nine early enrollees for the Buckeyes. Meyer for the second straight year lost three starting defensive backs early to the NFL (Malik Hooker, Marshon Lattimore and Gareon Conley). Okudah, along with fellow early enrollees Shaun Wade and Isaiah Pryor, will have an opportunity to play right away. \nAs could several others recent arrivals. \n“You know, these guys are already working out,” said Meyer. “We got from the weekend from recruiting and the last three days. They’re walking around the weight room and facility talking to our guys and my goodness, we’ve got nine guys here right now that I would anticipate the majority of them will play next year.” \nWhich one becomes the next Elliott is anyone’s best guess. In the meantime, Meyer now uses the leading candidate for Rookie of the Year as an example for his current players.

There’s some great storylines of guys we’ve seen develop, but Zeke might be the best of all.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T04:23:38.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
