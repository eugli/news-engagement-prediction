(AP) More The most recent example: on Thursday’s “PFT Live,” Thomas gave his reaction to the Super Bowl LI trophy presentation.\n“I especially enjoyed how over-eager Roger was to smile at all the Patriots and give them a big handshake, but then as soon as he gave them the trophy he scurried off the stage like a rat. It was awesome,” Thomas said.\nIn the days after the Super Bowl matchup was set, Thomas tweeted that even though he’d love to see his friend and former teammate Alex Mack (now the Falcons’ center) win a Super Bowl, he would “sure love” to see NFL commissioner Roger Goodell hand the trophy to Tom Brady. He later told ESPN’s “Mike & Mike” show that he loves awkward situations; Goodell handing the trophy to Brady, whom he suspended four games for his alleged involvement in deflate-gate certainly qualified.\nSome other gems from Thomas, who also said on “PFT Live” that as he gets older, he’s less and less concerned with whether anyone has a problem with him expressing his opinions:\nOn whether Goodell might have had some, ahem, liquid courage before the trophy presentation on Sunday night:\nDid it sound like @nflcommish may have been \"easing the nerves\" a bit before his meeting with Kraft and Brady tonight?\n— Joe Thomas (@joethomas73) February 6, 2017\nOn 2014 Browns first-round pick Justin Gilbert, who was released by the Pittsburgh Steelers this week:\nIf you don't like football, it doesn't matter how talented you are, your star will burn out quick. https://t.co/r7PfDSTljL\n— Joe Thomas (@joethomas73) February 6, 2017\nOn the Pro Bowl – and Cleveland’s terrible 1-15 season:\nWhat a great pro bowl!! AFC wins and I double my yearly win total all in the same night!\n— Joe Thomas (@joethomas73) January 30, 2017\nOn parenting:\nIs it a faux pas if I take off my kids diaper, and upon noticing it's dry, fold it up and stow it in my back pocket for future use?\n— Joe Thomas (@joethomas73) January 24, 2017\nKeep dropping your truths and laughs, Joe.\nMore on Yahoo Sports:\n• Former NBA enforcer Charles Oakley arrested at Knicks game\n• Jerry Jones unsure how to resolve Tony Romo’s situation\n• Steph Curry called President Trump an ‘ass’ without calling him an ‘ass’\n• MLB plans to test radical new extra-innings rules", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/joethomas73/status/823686205523054596", "https://twitter.com/joethomas73/status/823590101250871297", "https://yhoo.it/2lvfWu5&quot;", "https://yhoo.it/2loykYG&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2ym5HR0.XhgdodkgiPkmQg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/bcbbbb13fc337de4ac6035f86d04235a", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2ym5HR0.XhgdodkgiPkmQg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/bcbbbb13fc337de4ac6035f86d04235a);", "https://twitter.com/nflcommish", "https://yhoo.it/2lvfWu5", "http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/02/09/joe-thomas-goodell-scurried-off-the-stage-like-a-rat-at-the-super-bowl/", "https://twitter.com/joethomas73/status/828712135366545410", "https://yhoo.it/2kXxAc0&quot;", "https://twitter.com/joethomas73/status/823590101250871297&quot;", "https://twitter.com/joethomas73/status/828450352081010688", "https://yhoo.it/2kXxAc0", "http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/02/09/joe-thomas-goodell-scurried-off-the-stage-like-a-rat-at-the-super-bowl/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://twitter.com/joethomas73/status/826122819587162123", "https://yhoo.it/2k7HfgW", "https://yhoo.it/2k7HfgW&quot;", "https://yhoo.it/2loykYG", "https://t.co/r7PfDSTljL"], "published": "2017-02-10T00:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T00:34:43.901+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
