Carruthers was joined by a string of trustees.\nMultiple York board trustees urge Nancy Elgie to do 'what's required' as she refuses to resign \nThe following day, provincial education minister  Mitzie Hunter added her voice to the chorus.\n\"Using language like that is unacceptable and should not be tolerated in our society and especially in our school system,\" Education Minister Mitzie Hunter told reporters Tuesday, in caling for York region school trustee Nancy Elgie to resign. (Mike Crawley)\nIn a statement delivered by her son at Tuesday's meeting, the 82-year-old offered a voluntary three to six-month absence from her post. She wrote she was heartsick after being heard allegedly using the \"N-word\" to refer to mother-of-three, Charline Grant — something she claimed was the result of poor judgement caused by a brain injury.\nPremier calls use of 'N-word' 'unacceptable behaviour' but won't say trustee should resign \nOn Friday, Grant told CBC Toronto she was grateful that Elgie decided to do \"the right thing,\" saying the slur was especially hurtful not only for what it was, but also because it came after a complaint she'd filed for her son, who she alleged suffered discrimination at his Woodbridge-area school.\nTo have the word used against her in any context, let alone that one, made the comment that much more painful, she said.\nElgie incident overshadowed larger problems at board, parent says \"But my fight was not with Nancy,\" Grant said. \"That was a distraction, to be honest. Now we can get back to fixing the problems at the York Region District School Board.\"\nAfter she came forward, Grant says, parents began contacting her with their own stories of what she describes as systemic racism and discrimination rampant at the board.\nOne of the most prominent of those cases involved Ghada Sadaka, principal of Sir Wilfrid Laurier Public School in Markham, who published several posts on Facebook about Islam and refugees that some parents reported as offensive. Sadaka later apologized for the \"discriminatory postings,\" one of which suggested banning burkas in Europe.\nCharline Grant received an apology from school board trustee Nancy Elgie after the 82-year-old uttered a racial slur against her, but the mother of 3 says issues of systemic racism have long gone unaddressed under the watch of the board's current director. (CBC)\nJust last night, Grant says, she received a call from a distraught parent who said her 13-year-old son had been called the \"N-word\" at school. \n\"[Elgie] stepping down was never going to fix the issue,\" Grant said.\nInstead, Grant and others have said what's required is a change in leadership, beginning with the firing of director J. Philip Parappally.\nGrant says Parappally and former board chair Anna DeBartolo mishandled the investigation into Elgie's comments, choosing to classify them under the board's respectful workplace policy, under which the process and results of the investigation were treated as private. Elgie would have at most been barred from attending some meetings, a punishment Grant believes would have \"no teeth.\" \nThe board is currently under a review launched at the province's direction. The ministry expects a final report by April 7th.\nDirector doesn't answer questions about stepping down Following Elgie's statement Friday, Parappally issued a statement saying the board is committed to \"rebuilding trust and healing with the community that was so deeply affected by this incident.\"\n\"There has rightly been much attention paid to a racial slur said by Trustee Nancy Elgie. There is no context in which the use of such a term is acceptable,\" the statement said. \nFollowing Elgie’s statement Friday, Parappally issued a statement saying the board is committed to “rebuilding trust and healing with the community that was so deeply affected by this incident.” (York Region District School Board)\n\"As I have stated in the Boardroom, I am sorry for the pain experienced by the families and communities affected by these incidents of racism. As Director for this organization, particularly as its first racialized Director, these types of occurrences deeply sadden me,\" it continued.\nParappally did not respond to questions about stepping down himself. \nAt its next meeting, the board will have to formally accept Elgie's resignation, chair Carruthers said in a statement Friday.\nThey will then begin the \"transparent and fair\" process of filling her vacancy, the statement said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T03:13:37.298+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
