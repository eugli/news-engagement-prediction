(Photo: AP) \nBeing president is a difficult job, and I don’t begrudge the officeholder from taking the occasional day off.\nHowever, current President Donald Trump was relentlessly critical of former President Barack Obama, railing against Obama for taking vacations and/or for golfing. Only here’s the thing: In his first month in office, Trump has spent way more taxpayer money than Obama did on weekend getaways and has done a LOT more golfing.\nIt’s been estimated that in just his first month Trump’s golfing forays to Florida on the weekends have cost taxpayers $10 million .\nBy comparison, during President Obama’s entire eight years in office his vacations – with all the security precautions that come with protecting a president and his family – cost taxpayers $97 million.\nIt’s an awful lot of money.\nBut it took eight years.\nGolfing = 20 percent of Trump's time Trump is on pace to spend more taxpayer money than that in one year.\nOne.\nThis from a man who for years has ridiculed Obama for taking time off.\nHere are just a few or Trump’s tweets about that:\nCan you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2014 President @BarackObama 's vacation is costing taxpayers millions of dollars----Unbelievable!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2012 I play golf to relax. My company is in great shape. @BarackObama plays golf to escape work while America goes down the drain.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 30, 2011 Trump also has been golfing at least six times during his first 31 days.\nThat’s roughly 20 percent of his time.\nTwenty percent.\nThis from a man who tweeted this about his predecessor:\n@BarackObama played golf yesterday. Now he heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha's Vineyard. Nice work ethic.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 15, 2011 Nice work ethic, indeed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T21:24:27.682+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
