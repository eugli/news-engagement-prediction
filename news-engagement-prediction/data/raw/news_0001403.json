PUBLISHED: 21:59, Wed, Feb 1, 2017 | UPDATED: 21:59, Wed, Feb 1, 2017 Paul Pogba \nDespite a slight improvement in recent months, Paul Pogba remains far from justifying his hefty transfer fee. \nAnd even a new haircut wasn't enough to inspire him this evening. \nHe was unlucky to twice see a shot well saved by Hull goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic but overall he failed to exert enough influence on the game. Man United fans reacts as Phil Jones limps off against Hull Wed, February 1, 2017 Express Sport brings you all the best tweets as Phil Jones limps off during Manchester United's clash with Hull Man Utd via Getty Images 1 of 10 Man United's Phil Jones limped off against Hull and this is how fans reacted Half time substitutions \nManchester United were very poor in the first half and it was no surprise to see Jose Mourinho make a substitution at the interval. \nThe Portuguese is never afraid to make changes and Wayne Rooney was called on to make the difference in place of Michael Carrick. \nIn truth any United player in midfield and attack could have been taken off. Premature dancing \nRio Ferdinand criticised Pogba and Jesse Lingard after the United duo posted a video of themselves performing a new dance celebration routine. \nThe ex-United defender questioned the timing of the video with United currently sixth in the league. \nAnd his comments will have extra weight now after United's disappointing display. EPA Manchester United's Paul Pogba Anthony Martial \nThe France international was bizarrely absent during United's pre-match warm-up yet he was able to take his place on the bench alongside the other substitutes. \nHowever Mourinho opted not to bring on the 21-year-old despite the lack of pace and creativity in his side. \nAfter an impressive debut season, Martial has failed to live up to expectations and his Old Trafford future is increasingly uncertain. Phil Jones \nThe central-defender has been one of United's more impressive performers since working his way back into the team. \nBut he came off in the second half with a muscle injury which will be a blow to Mourinho. \nHowever it will give a chance to Chris Smalling and Eric Bailly to reclaim their spot.
