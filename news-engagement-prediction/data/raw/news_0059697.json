He was able to escape and ran a mile where a Good Samaritan notified emergency services on his behalf. Upon our arrival to ICU we found him unrecognizable due to the extent of his injuries. We are thanking God he is alive and healing, but are deeply saddened and broken inside at the thought that someone could do this to such a beautiful, caring and compassionate person. As many of you know, Chris is a computer gaming engineer as well as a professional juggler. Due to his injuries, he is currently unable to do what he loves to do the most.As a juggler, he has brought joy to thousands of people. He has won countless juggling contests and often travels to participate in events (he was scheduled to leave this weekend for one in Texas). He's performed at events as small as backyard birthday parties up to large scale festivities such as California Great America's Halloween Haunt. If you're lucky, you can catch him practicing at a local park or school. One can't pass by him without being awe struck or hearing \"man, that is so awesome!\". Needless to say, juggling is a big part of who Chris is.When he's not doing events, he's teaching others the art of diabolo spinning, working on his own line of products or engineering... something! Out of all the people in this world, our Chris is the least deserving of this type of heinous act. As you can imagine, medical expenses are quickly adding up. He had surgery to his shoulder, and will require facial reconstructive surgery in a few weeks. I am trying to ease the financial burden this situation is weighing on my brother. He was in the middle of moving, and now has to worry about extensive medical bills on top of it. He was uninsured at the time of the incident.Any help you can give is greatly appreciated. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
