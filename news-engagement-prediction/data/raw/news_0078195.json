I asked to have the procedure every year for 11 years, but every time the NHS would turn me away. I was too young to make that kind of decision, they told me. Finally, at the age of 29, I got the green light. \nWhile some might consider sterilisation an extreme option, I’m only one of a growing number of young people in the UK making that choice. \nToday, one in five British women will end their child-bearing years without having a child – twice the number 30 years ago. While the UK doesn’t collect stats for men, European figures suggest a similar decline in fatherhood. Though not all are necessarily getting sterilised, it indicates a stark lifestyle shift. \nBBC Three documentary Young And Sterile: My Choice follows this growing movement, and filmed with me throughout my own procedure. \nWhen it came to the day of my operation, I was nervous. Not because this was the moment my child-bearing years would be over forever, but because I’d be getting a knife stuck into my testicles. When the vasectomy was all over I just felt this huge sense of relief. That feeling hasn’t really faded since. Paul Pritchard \nIf you aren’t familiar with the science, a vasectomy essentially blocks your tubes and keeps the sperm out of your semen. It’s a relatively quick procedure carried out under local anaesthetic, and is considered permanent. \nWhen it was all over I just felt this huge sense of relief. That feeling hasn’t really faded since. \nAfter being quizzed on this choice for the last decade, I know the first thing people want to know is simply – why? \nIt’s different for everyone, and my reasons are varied. Genetics is a big one. I have type one diabetes, and have suffered from depression. My wife also suffers from several health conditions. I’ve gone through some horrible things at the hands of both conditions – and also put my parents through a lot – and I don’t want to willingly pass that on to anyone. \nYet equally, I’m a selfish git. I like my money, I like my spare time, and I like having my own life. I just don’t want to put the time and effort into a child. Medicine is about healing – so the very philosophy of medicine is challenged by these kind of procedures. Leonora Butau Bioethicist \nLuckily, my wife feels exactly the same: I love her to bits, but I suspect our relationship would have broken down if she didn’t. Previous relationships have split for exactly that reason, because they wanted kids, while the mere idea of it made me wince. \nSo why bother with all the nonsense of contraception when you’re so sure of all that? \nI understand why it’s not the right choice for some, and speaking objectively I suppose it’s a good thing that the NHS is so cautious. As Leonora Butau, bioethicist and expert in fertility and sex ethics states: \n“Sterilisation is basically damaging a perfectly healthy organ. It’s a drastic procedure. Medicine is about healing – so the very philosophy of medicine is challenged by these kind of procedures.\" \nBut it's the right choice for me. I love my wife, and having unprotected sex and being able to be completely intimate with her is important. \nI’m lucky to be surrounded by a very supportive family and group of friends. They respect my decision. My friends are quite happy to joke with me about it down the pub, with quips like, “Paul not being in the gene pool? Thumbs up!” \nThe one thing that seems to really surprise people is the fact I work with kids. I work for a games workshop, where we manufacture toy soldiers that you build, paint, and then play board games with. I run sessions to teach people about the hobby, and many of those are kids. \nIt’s rewarding work, especially when you make a breakthrough with the autistic kids. \nThat’s the thing – I don’t hate children. I might hate screaming babies, push chairs and most of all, pushy, smug parents, but I don’t hate kids. I just don’t want my own. \nPeople seem to think, for some reason, that this area of your life is somehow their business. Total strangers will just ask you outright, “Why don’t you have any children?” \nSo I tend to combat that with questioning them right back. \n“Why do you think you should know that? Why do you think my testicles are important to you? Do you really want them in your life?” \nIf people want to be rude to me about my choices then I’ll be rude back, I don’t care. \nI don’t have much of a social media presence, so thankfully haven’t had any criticism online. I know more high-profile faces like Holly Brockwell , who fought a four-year battle with the NHS to be sterilised at 30, suffered some real abuse at the hands of trolls. \nGenerally though, I do think there’s more stigma or resistance associated to a woman making the same decision I did. You hear people saying things like, “How could a woman not want to have children, what kind of monster are they?” There’s just more societal pressure on them, and they are often vilified for not complying with the norm. It’s so unfair. I know that if I hadn’t had the procedure, then my wife may well have instead. \nWhen it comes to the childfree movement , we’re not exactly an oppressed group. We’re just not taken as seriously as I would like. But after 11 years of trying, I’ve finally taken control of my own fertility, and it feels great. Now I can happily get on with my sexual misadventures and not have to pay any price for it. \nAs told to Catriona White ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T00:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:46:32.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
