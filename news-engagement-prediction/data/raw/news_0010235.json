With just one in 10 matches since the turn of the year - and that against League Two Plymouth - Liverpool's silverware hopes are fading fast.\nAfter their latest setback, a 2-0 defeat at relegation-threatened Hull City on Saturday, Klopp delivered a dressing-down to his players in a brutal full-time inquest.\nNone of the under-performers in his team were spared as Klopp simply couldn't contain his anger any more following another listless performance.\nJurgen Klopp rages during Liverpool's 2-0 loss at Hull City on Saturday afternoon\nRoberto Firmino and Alberto Moreno reflect on another demoralising afternoon for the Reds\nNathaniel Clyne cuts a dejected figure as Liverpool slump to defeat at the KCOM Stadium\nLiverpool have dropped out of the top four in the Premier League table following the loss\nSince arriving on Merseyside amid great fanfare in October 2015, Klopp has remoulded Liverpool's team in his own image and guided them to the finals of the League Cup and the Europa League last season.\nBut now, with their Premier League title challenge over and disappointing exits from the FA Cup and the EFL Cup still fresh in the memory, the first questions are being asked of Klopp and his methods.\nWe take a look back and assess the positives and negatives of Klopp's tenure at Anfield so far.\nSTYLE AND PHILOSOPHY\nFrom the heights of 2014, when Liverpool came within a whisker of winning the Premier League title with Luis Suarez, Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho and Daniel Sturridge in full-flight, Brendan Rodgers' team had regressed badly.\nFollowing the departure of Suarez to Barcelona, the Reds crashed out of the Champions League at the group stage and slumped from second to sixth in the league table.\nAnd after a sluggish start to the 2015-16 campaign, which included defeats to West Ham and Manchester United, Rodgers was sacked and Klopp flown in to popular acclaim.\nBrendan Rodgers paid the price after Liverpool made a sluggish start to the 2015-16 season\nKlopp beams with delight as he is unveiled as Liverpool's manager in October 2015\nThe Liverpool fans quickly for behind the charismatic German manager after his appointment\nThe German quickly demonstrated his charisma and created a surge of optimism at Anfield, something only enhanced by early scalps of Chelsea (3-1) and Manchester City (4-1) away from home.\nThough Liverpool ultimately finished eighth in the Premier League, they reached two cup finals and there were many positive signs that Klopp had imported the winning philosophy he created at Borussia Dortmund.\nFavouring an attack-minded, fluid and speedy style of play, Klopp also demands that his teams possess plenty of energy and press their opponents constantly so as to ensure as much possession as possible.\nAs Klopp's ideas fermented this season, there have been many encouraging signs and, at times, their attacking play - with Coutinho, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane on song - has been outstanding.\nKlopp's exuberant displays of passion on the touchline endeared him further to the fans\nWith Philippe Coutinho pulling the strings, Liverpool are an exciting proposition to watch\nSadio Mane has also been in outstanding form for the Reds this season\nUp next for Liverpool Saturday Tottenham Hotspur (H)\nFebruary 27 Leicester City (A)\nMarch 4 Arsenal (H)\nMarch 12 Burnley (H)\nMarch 19 Manchester City (A)\nApril 1 Everton (H)\nGoals have certainly not been a problem, with Liverpool the joint-leading scorers in the Premier League with 52. In all competitions, they have scored four or more goals on seven occasions this season.\nBut in concentrating on building an irresistible attacking force similar to what he had at Dortmund, Klopp has neglected the defensive side.\nFar too often this season, they have been found wanting at the back with their keeper Loris Karius transmitting uncertainty and the likes of Dejan Lovren and Alberto Moreno struggling.\nOn Saturday at Hull, they again conceded a cheap goal as Simon Mignolet dropped a corner under pressure to gift Alfred N'Diaye a simple goal.\nHas Klopp made Liverpool a more exciting proposition to watch?\nGoing forward, they are as exciting as the 2014 team that came within a slip of the title. At the back, Klopp needs to sort things out otherwise his whole philosophy goes to waste.\nAlfred N'Diaye slots home Hull's first goal on Saturday after a Simon Mignolet clanger\nOumar Niasse celebrates scoring Hull's second goal against Liverpool on Saturday\nNiasse rounds off a crucial victory for Hull in the closing minutes of the game\nSIGNINGS\nHaving arrived in the October, Klopp didn't spend in the January window but was then backed last summer. While Liverpool didn't match the Manchester clubs for spending, they still parted with £61.9million.\nThe purchase of Mane for £30m from Southampton has proved excellent value for money. The Senegal forward has scored nine times and assisted in another seven goals in all competitions and was sorely missed when away at the Africa Cup of Nations.\nThe £23million spent on Georginio Wijnaldum of Newcastle United has also proved good value for money, with the Dutchman proving he can perform at the highest level in the Premier League.\nGeorginio Wijnaldum has proved a good signing - scoring Liverpool's leveller against Chelsea\nJoel Matip, a free transfer, also brought some much-needed stability to Liverpool's defence and was unfortunate to suffer an injury. They are definitely stronger for his return.\nThe form of goalkeeper Karius, who cost £4.7million from Mainz, has been debated often but there have been too many high-profile mistakes that have cost Liverpool crucial points.\nRagnar Klavan has featured more in Matip's absence and looked shaky, with errors and poor displays against Sunderland and Southampton that are bound to stick in the memory of Liverpool fans.\nLoris Karius has been dropped following a series of high-profile errors\nSo Klopp's signings have been a mixed bag, but he has at least avoided some of the big money flops Liverpool had become renowned for in the recent past.\nRemember that just before Klopp's arrival, Rodgers had signed Christian Benteke for a whopping £32.5million, 12 months after getting Mario Balotelli in to replace Suarez. And let's not mention the hit they took on Andy Carroll.\nPROGRESS IN THE LEAGUE\nIt was well-documented that Klopp's first 50 Premier League games at Anfield yielded fewer points that Louis van Gaal's first 50 at Manchester United by 94 points to 92.\nThere was something inevitable about Liverpool slipping back to eighth in last season given their slow start under Rodgers and then the need for Klopp to acclimatise to life in the Premier League.\nKlopp's record in his first 50 Premier League games was worse than Van Gaal's at Man United\nAs he tried to get his players to invest in his playing philosophy, there were some absolutely stunning performances, such as stuffing Everton 4-0 and Manchester City 3-0, and sobering setbacks that ultimately cost them European football.\nTheir start to this season offered optimism that Klopp's methods were coming to fruition. As they won 4-3 at Arsenal on the opening day and then beat Chelsea 2-1 at Stamford Bridge, Liverpool had the air of title-winner.\nIndeed, Klopp's record against sides in and around Liverpool in the top six has been very good indeed.\nYes, there were defensive alarm bells, but these were swept away by the mastery of their attacking play. It didn't matter if they conceded two because they'd score three, or four, or five.\nThey were top for a couple of weeks in October and November and were still second behind Chelsea at the turn of the year.\nLiverpool have managed just one win in 10 since the turn of the year - against Plymouth\nBut while their 1-0 win over Manchester City on New Year's Eve should have heralded a winning run but has had the opposite effect.\nSince then, they've lost to Swansea and Hull, and drawn with Sunderland, Manchester United and Chelsea. Weaknesses have been exposed, old failings have returned but the downturn, which followed a four-game winning run, is baffling.\nWorryingly, Liverpool have now dropped to fifth place - out of the Champions League places - and have made their worst start to a calendar year for 24 years.\nThe depressing reality for the fans is that the dream of becoming champions for the first time since 1990 remains as distant as ever.\nPROGRESS IN CUP COMPETITIONS\nThe negativity of Liverpool's fall-off in the league last season was at least balanced out by their runs to the finals of the League Cup and the Europa League, though they were unsuccessful in both.\nThese cup runs under Klopp reignited some of the glory nights of old, but they were beaten on penalties by Manchester City in the League Cup and threw away a half-time lead to lose 3-1 to Sevilla in the Europa League.\nIt means that in the past decade Liverpool, one avid collectors of trophies, have won just one League Cup (in 2012).\nKlopp commiserates his players after their UEFA Europa League final loss to Sevilla\nThis season has been much worse. Despite not being involved in Europe, Klopp fielded a weakened side in the FA Cup and, after scraping past Plymouth, they were beaten at Anfield by Wolves.\nThey reached the semi-finals of the EFL Cup before losing in both legs to a Southampton side who aren't in particularly great form themselves. It is a massive opportunity missed in both to get Klopp's first trophy in the cabinet.\nPERSONALITY AND POPULARITY\nIt didn't take long for Klopp to endear himself to Liverpool fans and a wider audience in England. With his natural charisma, range of facial expressions, sense of humour and way with words, he is an incredibly likeable guy.\nThere have been plenty of moments that have made us smile, such as when he lost his glasses celebrating a last-minute winner at Norwich or his pumped-up celebrations when Liverpool beat his old club Dortmund.\nKlopp's personality means he is never going to be short of admirers and commercial opportunities and we are starting to see him pop up in quite a few adverts.\nKlopp celebrates with Dejan Lovren after Liverpool beat his old club Borussia Dortmund\nKlopp at his angriest when confronting West Brom manager Tony Pulis last season\nHe is prone to moments of rage, though, even when things are going right. The other day, he ranted in the face of fourth official Neil Swarbrick even though Liverpool had just scored against Chelsea.\nOn Saturday at Hull, there was another range of facial expressions, but for all the wrong reasons.\nHas Klopp made Liverpool and the Premier League a more colourful place? Definitely. Has he made Liverpool a more attractive team to watch? Yes. Has he transformed Liverpool into trophy contenders?
