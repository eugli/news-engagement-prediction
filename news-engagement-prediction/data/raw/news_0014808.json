If they don’t, then our MPs must do the right thing and vote against it anyway.”\n\nHis call shows the depth of division over Brexit within Labour, with both Corbyn’s supporters and detractors split over how the leadership should respond.\nA number of the leader’s frontbench allies, including Clive Lewis, the shadow business secretary, represent constituencies that voted strongly in favour of remaining in the EU, and are thought to be struggling with the idea of voting to trigger article 50 if the bill is not amended. \nThree shadow cabinet ministers – Jo Stevens, Rachael Maskell, and Dawn Butler – chose to resign last week rather than vote with the leadership in favour of Brexit, while a dozen frontbenchers and several whips defied the party line.\nCorbyn has indicated he will be lenient towards dissenters given the difficulties of Labour MPs representing pro-remain areas.\nThe party will attempt to get amendments passed on protecting workers’ rights, securing greater parliamentary scrutiny, maintaining access to the single market and guaranteeing the rights of EU nationals. However, Labour sources believe Corbyn will ask the parliamentary party to vote in favour of the bill regardless of whether those amendments pass, having said he will not stand in the way of Brexit.\nCortes, whose union has given hundreds of thousands of pounds to Labour under Corbyn and donated premises during his leadership campaigns, said MPs should think again before backing Brexit at any cost.\n“The question Labour MPs must ask themselves before they walk into the division lobbies … is what is their plan if their amendments are defeated.\n“Having set out their oppositional stall, they must not then wave through legislation that counters Labour’s shared values, nor our people’s and whole nation’s interests. There is no case for a Tory Brexit at any cost. If the amendments fail, Labour must whip its MPs to vote against Tory Brexit. Labour is, after all, the opposition.” \nIn theory, Labour could choose to abstain on Wednesday’s final vote if all the amendments fail, but senior figures have suggested this is unlikely, and whips say they have been told to expect the same position again.\nThe final decision will only be made after Corbyn meets his party’s Brexit subcommittee – including Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary – and then his full shadow cabinet on Tuesday. \nEmily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that it was unfair to brand the party as hopelessly divided over the issue. \n“The Labour party is a national party, and we represent the nation, and the nation is divided on this. It is very difficult and many MPs representing majority-remain constituencies have this very difficult balancing act: do I represent my constituency, or do I represent the nation?” Thornberry said.\n“Labour, as a national party, have a clear view. We have been given our instructions. We lost the referendum. We fought to stay in Europe but the public have spoken and so we do as we’re told. But the important thing now is not to give Theresa May a blank cheque. We have to make sure we get the right deal for the country.”\nThe bill will be debated over three days this week, with the shadow Brexit minister, Matthew Pennycook, starting for the party in the House of Commons on Monday, pushing for the government to give parliament more oversight of the Brexit process.\nLabour will also press for a unilateral guarantee to EU citizens already living in the UK and for a meaningful final vote before the deal goes to the European parliament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T22:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T19:39:38.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
