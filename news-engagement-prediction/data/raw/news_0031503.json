I hope they’re very happy. He is a dear, dear friend, my whole family just adore him. \n“All that matters to us is that he’s happy. He’s a really, properly brilliant man, and I’m keeping my fingers crossed for him. I wish the very best for him.” Zoe Ball is a smitten kitten (Photo: Getty) \nRadio 2 presenter Zoe, who hosts Strictly Come Dancing spin-off It Takes Two, got together with Billy a few months after splitting from her DJ husband Norman “Fatboy Slim” Cook . \nShe recently helped Billy move into his new flat in South London. \nMolly broke up with him several years ago after they had lived together in London. Zoe Ball and Norman Cook (Photo: PA) \nShe has a child with her new partner but stays in touch with Billy – who has also worked on ITV’s The Xtra Factor – and added: “He is part of the family.” \nIn August Zoe and Norman, 53, whose kids are 16 and six, announced they were splitting after 17 years of marriage. It was claimed she was tired of the DJ’s teetotal lifestyle. \nThey tweeted: “We’re still great friends and will continue to support each other and raise our beautiful children together living next door but one”. Molly says the couple are a perfect fit \nCracks in their relationship started showing in 2015 when Zoe was snapped kissing a 22-year-old singer.
