Joo Kim Tiah, CEO of the Holborn Group, the tower’s developer, will also be attendance. \nProtesters are also planning to be there. Occupy Vancouver has stated they will be holding a day-long event outside the tower. Another event is set to start at Jack Poole Plaza at 4 p.m. \nTrump does not actually own the tower, he simply licenses the name to the developer. \nThe $360-million hotel and condominium development on Georgia Street has been referred to as a “ beacon of racism, intolerance and bullying ” by one Vancouver councillor, who urged Tiah to drop the Trump brand. \nAfter Trump pledged to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. while he was campaigning in December 2015, Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson then penned a letter to the Holborn Group asking the developer to take the Trump name off the tower.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:07:23.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
