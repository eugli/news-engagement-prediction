All photos courtesy of Andreas Thrn \nThis weekend, Sweden's Medical Products Agency made a groundbreaking decision .Two patients will be prescribedmedical marijuana for chronic pain for the first time in Swedish history.But the journey to theserulings which the agency highlights areabout individual caseshas been long. For one of the patients, wheelchair-bound Andreas Thrn, it's been four messyyears.\nThrn has been paraplegic since he was 15 years old, when his fifth and sixth neck vertebrae were crushed in a motorcycle accident. He's bound to an electric wheelchair and suffers from spasticity and incurable pain in his stomach, midriff, and legs.He describes it as \"a burning, cutting pain that can't really be explained. It just hurts like hell.\"\nIn 2010, almost 20 years after the accident, Thrn became a dad. Later that year, his condition dramatically deteriorated. Recurring constipation and UTIs accompanied the pain he was already suffering, rendering him almost completely unable to take care of hisdaughter or to run his business. He was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and a chronically inflamed prostate. He fell into a deep depression antidepressants and therapy helped, but the excruciating pain remained.\nThe specialists treating Thrn were running out of options they had given him every painkiller Swedish law permitted, but nothing worked. As a last resort, he was offered methadone, a strong opioid and effective painkiller commonly administered to detoxify heroin addicts. His previous attempts with opioid treatments had caused horrible side effects. \"I'm very sensitive to medication and other [psychoactive] substances,\" Thrn explained in court. \"I've been high on most of the medication I've tried, and that's never been my goal. I just wanted to get rid of the pain. Should I live the rest of my life with all the side effects I've gotten from other opiates?\" He declined the methadone treatment.\n\nOut of viable medicaloptions, he turned to the internet. On an American forum, Thrnfound other paraplegics who recommended non-psychoactive cannabis, with low levels of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, the main psychoactive molecule in cannabis) and an equal or higher ratio of Cannabidiol (CBD, a constituent with a range of medical benefits that counteracts negative effects of THC). He had tried smoking pot before and experienced some pain relief, but the anxiety and paranoia triggered by the THC were too heavy to make it worthwhile.\nAccording to the other paraplegics on the forumhowever, medical marijuanahad great potential to alleviate neuropathic pain and wouldn't induce a high. \"I had to try something to get a life where I could function,be a part of my familyand be able to work.\" After long talks with his wife, deliberating the risks and implications of breaking the law fines, possible jail time, retraction of his business permit and thesocial stigma, to name a few he decided to give medical marijuanaa try.\nThrn began cultivating cannabis plants in a small tent behind the family's washing machine. The flowers were harvested, mixed with coconut oil and water, and boiled into a viscous mass. With a teaspoon of goo in his coffee every morning and evening (about 0.4 grams of cannabis per day), Thrn soon experienced aremarkable decrease inpain,spasticity and anxiety. His sleep patterns normalisedand his bowel and prostate complications subsided completely. \"My body felt good and relaxed. I was able to work full-time, take care of my family, and had enough energy to exercise,\" he told the court in 2015.\nWATCH: Our documentary on medical marijuana for children: \nIn January 2015, about two years into the illegal gardening project, two police officers visited Thrn's home. They cut down the cannabis plants and had Thrn drug tested and reported. It's not confirmed how exactlythe police found out about Thrn's operation.\nAt first, the court acquitted Thrn of drug crimes. \"It was probably our humanitarian thinking, based on what he told us about his situation,\" one of the jury memberssaid about the decision. The ruling was ground-breaking in Sweden no one previously charged with crimes relating to cannabis had been acquittedafterreferring to medical necessity. However, the prosecutor appealed the decision, and on the31st of March2016, Thrn was convicted, fined and sentenced to probation by the court of appeals. He was deemed unfit to serve a prison sentence butordered to pay 11,700 SEK [1,220].\nThe case was widely covered and debated in Sweden. It was all pretty much standard procedure, but in the mess of references to scientific reports either confirming or denying the medical properties of marijuana a very important question was raised:Should the government have the right to use the law to prohibit citizens from living decent lives? It seemed cynical to prosecute a self-medicating disabled man when the methods provided by the state itself had proved ineffective. Butconsidering Swedish narco-political tradition, Thrn's sentence wasn't surprising. \nSwedish drug policy is based on the conviction that all drugs are extremely dangerous and drug use is a big social problem. That conviction isbased on the work of psychiatrist Nils Bejerot, internationally renowned for his advising roleduring the Norrmalmstorg robbery in 1973, after which he coined the term Stockholm Syndrome .\n\nAndreas Thrn's gardening project. \nIn the 1960s, drug addiction was perceived as being the result ofsociety failing its most vulnerable citizens, and drug policy focused on rehabilitation. At the time, Bejerot was fighting a small scale governmentexperiment, whereheroin and amphetamines were legally prescribed. He was convincedthe government was creating a plague by practically feeding people dangerous drugs, and stressed that non-medical drug use had to be criminalised. Efforts to control drug use and end addictionshould focus on street dealers and users, he argued. No consumers, no market.\n\nOnereason to why Thrn's medicinal marijuana use wasn't acceptableis because the majority of Swedes still consider marijuana to be dangerous , with insignificant medical properties. It's perceived as agateway to heavier drug use.\nRead: Sweden's Battle Against Drugs and Prejudice \nContemporary pop culture has normalised marijuana to a certain extent, but its illegal status hasn't changed. That'sa real pain for people like Thrn, for whom it's an effective remedy. \"In recent years we have seen how many countries and states have allowed natural cannabis to be used as medicine,\" Health Minister Gabriel Wikstrmwrote to mein an email last year. \"The decision to permit it has been taken politically or, in some cases, by courts, without clinical testing. I think that's problematic and not the development I would like to see in Sweden.\"\n\"If no other legal alternatives appear, I will supply myself with medical cannabis in one way or another,\" Thrn told me last year. \"Of course I want to medicate with cannabis without breaking the law, but if I'm not given that opportunity, I'll keep my head highand continue to break the law without hesitation or shame.\"\n\nOne of Andreas Thrn's medical marijuana plants. \n\nThrn stopped the cannabis treatment after his arrest in 2015, after which his health declinedalmost immediately. After a few weeks, the neuropathic pains were back in full effect a year later, the prostate inflammation had returned, along with constant anxiety. His work capacity wentfrom 100 to 25 percent.\n\nThrn is only one of several Swedish cases ofmedical marijuana usein the past few years. While courts tend to refrain from dishing out prison sentences for this type of drug offence, it can be difficult to understand why these peopleare prosecuted in the first place. There's no obvious victimand it's unclear what justice is served. \"I can't comment on individual cases,\" Wikstrm wrote in an email when I asked him about the phenomenon. \"But when it comes to pharmaceuticals we have a solid process for approving new drugs in Sweden. This is monitored by the Medical Products Agency. I have confidence in the procedure we have for approving new pharmaceuticals today.\"\nRead: The Dad Trying to Legalise Medical Weed in Sweden \nJournalist Magnus Linton has a more straightforward theory. In his book Knark En svensk historia [Drugs A Swedish History] he writes, \"the point of the [Swedish] drug-free society has never been to penalise drug offence from a standpoint of reasonability in relation to a drug's toxicity or the quantity of possession, but rather, to forcefully punish the betrayal against the common goal [the drug-free society].\" The notion follows the Bejerotian logic, which seems feasible. Wikstrm doesn't reject Linton's affirmation. Instead, he asserts that almost all parliamentary parties support the goal of a drug-free society, but that this can't conflict with the care and treatment needed for drug users and addicts.\"The health care policy should enable seriously ill people to live decent lives, I think everyone agrees with that,\" Wikstrm wrote to me. \n\nIn the end of last week , Thrn's fight to live a decent life finally paid off. After beingcriminalised by thejudicial systemfor trying to solvehis healthissues, the Medical Products Agency finally agreed with him. Although the agency emphasises that the decision to prescribe medical marijuana to Thrn and another patient won't change Sweden'sstance on cannabis in general, the rulingis previously unheard of who knows what's next?\nMore from VICE: \nA 'Budtender' Gives Us a Potent Look Inside a Weed Dispensary \nWeed Saved My Life After a Decade on Anxiety Meds \nWhy Some Pregnant Women Get High Despite Doctors' Orders", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:01:49.043+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
