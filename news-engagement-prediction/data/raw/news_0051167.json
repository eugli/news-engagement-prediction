PHOTO | CHRIS OMOLLO By DAVID KWALIMWA \nYou will have to keep off sex for the time being. That’s the bold message from the reigning Kenya Volleyball Federation league’s Most Valuable Female player Triza Atuka, to young and upcoming athletes. \nAtuka, a key player within the national women volleyball team, and a B.Com student at Jomo Kenyatta University of Science and Technology, explained that abstinence, alongside hard work and focus, increases the chances of athletes having a successful career. \nShe was speaking after conducting a day long volleyball coaching clinic at Nyakach Girls High School over the weekend. \n“I can see you are very talented, you have to know that a lot is expected from you by the society, your parents included. You need to be highly disciplined to make good choices like abstaining from early sex. Let’s perform on the pitch and in class, not anywhere else,” she said. \nDOPING IN SPORTS \nThe centre player, who starred for the national women volleyball during the FIVB World Cup in Japan in 2015, also advised the students to strike a balance between sports and education, while warning them of the dangers of engaging in doping in sports. \nAtuka, who is also the reigning African champion courtesy of her exploits with national team, has also played at the FIVB Grand Prix in Argentina and Puerto Rico, and represented Kenya Pipeline at the women club continental championship in Tunisia and Egypt in 2015 and 2016. \nIn attendance during this event was among others Harambee Starlets goalkeeper Lillian Owour who represented Kenya during last year’s Women’s Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon, and the school’s Principal Dora Okaalo, who said she has plans to turn the institution into both a sporting and academic giant.
