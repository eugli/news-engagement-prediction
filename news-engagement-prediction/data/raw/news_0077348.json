Some I have not seen in nine years! I just wish I don't well up on stage!' It turned out to be a premonition well-founded.\nThe Jamsteady edition on Friday evening was a super success. Online tickets had sold out and the organisers had to stop entry to the lounge by 10.15 pm. A visibly emotional Sahana, accompanied by Bunty on purcussions, Diptangshu on mandolin and dotara, Sunny on bass and Samantak on acoustic guitar, was greeted with loud cheer. It was a fusion act, true to its name, with khol, dubki, dotara and khanjani mixing it up with western string instruments and cahon. The London-based artiste with a strong Santiniketan heritage and Tollywood presence, had the audience rapt in attention with her set of folk numbers, interspersed with Rabindrasangeet ' Emon manob samaj, Aamar haath bandhibi, Kalozole kuchlatole, Oi je jhorer megher, Ekhono shei Brindabone, O je manena mana, so much so that she had to actually remind them, 'Haathtaali to de tora!'\nMusic lovers to Jamsteady regulars, Sahana's friends to first-timers, the lounge was jam-packed right till the end. While Sahana screamed at regular intervals spotting long-time-no-see friends in the crowd, others ran around for a selfie-op with her. We spotted her friends, Srijit Mukherji and Parambrata Chattopadhyay, too. 'It's a given that if Sahana is performing in Kolkata, I would be there. But I did not expect this huge a crowd,' said Parambrata after obliging a group of giggling female fans with a photograph.\nBDW, the evening was not just about music. Sahana tells us that enquiries about her elegant sari paired with an edgy blouse have been pouring in. Guess it's all about being loved across borders.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T16:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:00:43.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
