The Saters were the landlords of T.T.’s when it closed after 35 years at the Brookline Street location.\nAdvertisement\n“We have great respect for T.T.’s history, but this is something new,” Ned Wellbery, manager of Sonia and booking manager at The Middle East, said Wednesday.\nThe space has undergone a floor-to-ceiling renovation and will feature new lights, a full-service box office, and, notably, a revamped sound system. Aesthetically, Sonia will channel the Middle East with high ceilings, arches, and a mural depicting various musicians.\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond. The team aims to broaden the scope of the venue, as the room, which has a capacity of 320 people, is designed to host everything from live performances to weddings. The music will be diverse as well — Sonia is branded as an “all-genre” space.\n“You name it, we do it,” Wellbery said.\nWhile no acts have been booked yet, one is pending for March and the venue will be officially open by April 1.\nAdvertisement\n“We’re trying to book the best shows possible and work with the community as much as possible,” Wellbery said. “The Middle East has always had a tradition of being a staple in the Cambridge community, and we plan on keeping it that way.”\nSonia Rao can be reached at sonia.rao@globe.com .
