Stella McCartney has spoken out after bumping her Mini Cooper into the back of a taxi \nExplaining her decision, Ms McCartney's spokesman said she was \"very apologetic\" but \"felt intimidated\" when London minicab driver Arash Nabezadeh, 32, began filming her and allegedly followed the star to the gates of a nearby school, where her children study, in an attempt to get her details. \nPaul McCartney's daughter Stella hits cabbie's car on busy London street and drives off without giving her details \n\"Although she and the taxi driver did not swap full details, Ms McCartney thought that an insurance claim could be made from the licence plate number she was happy to provide, and knew the taxi driver had a full note of,\" the spokesperson said. The fashion designer has apologised for the incident (Photo: Splash) \n\"She thought she had done the right thing. \n\"When the driver, with two passengers, started filming her after the incident, she felt intimidated particularly when she realised they had followed her to the kids school, still filming her. \n\"She accepts liability for the incident and is very apologetic for any issues that have arisen from this incident.\" Stella declined to give her full details to the cab driver because she felt 'intimidated' (Photo: WENN) \nA source close to Ms McCartney, 45, said Mr Nabezadeh started filming and following Stella as soon as he recognised her. \nIn the footage, she can be seen telling him: \"Take the number of my licence plate. Do whatever you need to do, no problem. \n\"You don't need to film me, do whatever you need to do.\" \nStella then took his phone number and her husband, Alasdhair Willis, called the next day to pass on the details of their insurance broker and policy number, The Sun said.
