He also finalized the long pending Aarushi-Hemraj double murder case. \n\nHowever, upon his retirement, it was revealed in an income tax evasion probe against Qureshi that he and former agency chief regularly interacted \"on daily basis\" on Blackberry Messenger (BBM) platform. \n\nThe government had, in fact, informed the Supreme Court in 2014 that there were \"astonishing state of affairs\" between former CBI director AP Singh and meat exporter Moin Qureshi . \n\nThe present case registered under sections 8, 9, 13 (2) and 13 (1) (d) of prevention of corruption act, which deal with corrupt activities by public servants and private persons using public servants in lieu of any favour, has been registered on a reference given by Enforcement Directorate (ED) chief Karnal Singh. \n\nAlong with Moin Qureshi and AP Singh, CBI has named in its FIR a Hyderabad based businessman Pradeep Koneru, son of Rajendra Prasad Koneru, a co-accused in a case of disproportionate assets filed by the agency against Andhra politician Jaganmohan Reddy. \n\nKoneru's BBM messages with Moin Qureshi had suggested that he had requested meetings with then CBI chief AP Singh for discussing bail and discharge matters of his father and brother Madhu Koneru. \n\nThe CBI has also named Aditya Sharma, an employee of Moin Qureshi and unknown persons in the FIR. \n\nAfter registering the FIR, the agency conducted raids at the residences of AP Singh, Koneru in Hyderabad and Chennai and also of Moin Qureshi. \n\nThe CBI has alleged that Moin Qureshi has been working as a middleman for \"certain public servants\" and that the analysis of records discloses commission of cognizable offences. \n\nIt has been alleged that AP Singh, who headed the CBI, shared information with Moin Qureshi and also helped the latter in many cases. \n\nIn a report filed in the Supreme Court in October 2014, on the basis of an IT department probe, Attorney General Mukul Rohtagi had said, \"\"The report reveals an astonishing state of affairs (that is) wholly unbecoming and revealing the shocking conduct of a former CBI director, now a member of the UPSC. He was in regular touch with Qureshi and there were BBM exchanges between them on a daily basis and that too in code language. Many of the messages clearly revealed plans to save the accused in many cases\". \n\nLast year, Moin Qureshi had managed to leave the country without informing any authority despite having a Look Out Circular (LoC) against him. He, however, came back in few days.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:50:13.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
