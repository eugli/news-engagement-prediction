While Chi Chi fans will be happy to see him again, it would seem that the actor’s streak of bad luck has made him cautious about his upcoming venture. Directed by Dipankar Senapati, Aa Gaya Hero was earlier slated to release on February 24 then got pushed to March 3. Now, the release date has been pushed back even further, as it won’t be releasing with Commando 2 and Jeena Isi Ka Naam Hai.\nA close source reveals, “Since Kill Dil and Happy Ending didn’t work, Govinda is moving ahead very cautiously. From changing the title of the film to pushing the release date to avoiding a clash with other productions, Govinda is trying hard to save his film this time round. Since two other films are releasing on March 3, Aa Gaya Hero has been pushed to March 17.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T09:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T12:42:11.351+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
