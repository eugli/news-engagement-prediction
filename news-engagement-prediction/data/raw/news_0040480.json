By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Updated: February 18, 2017 9:34 am Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy (Reuters/Stringer photo) \nTamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy will be given the opportunity today on the floor of the state Assembly to prove the majority of his government. Though Palaniswamy was given 15 days by governor in-charge C Vidyasagar Rao to garner numbers, he decided to seek the vote of confidence on Saturday itself. While the House has a strength of 235, Palaniswamy, who belongs to the Sasikala faction, claims to have the support of 124 party MLAs. \nLIVE UPDATES \n9:15 am: The chief minister has reached the secretariat for the floor test. It is scheduled at 11 am. \nBACKGROUND \nPalaniswamy took oath as the chief minister of the state and was given 15 days to prove majority by the governor after the Supreme Court convicted VK Sasikala, the AIADMK general secretary, in the Disproportionate Assets case and sentenced her to four years in jail. Before her conviction, Sasikala’s road to the chief minister’s office was blocked by former chief minister O Panneerselvam who raised a banner of rebellion. Panneerselvam, who currently has the support of just 10 party MLAs, had presented himself as the choice of late J Jayalalithaa for the chief minister’s post. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T16:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T06:11:44.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
