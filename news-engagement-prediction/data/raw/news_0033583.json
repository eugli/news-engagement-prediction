Roses are red, markets are too: There's a fair bit of red in the stock markets right now, but losses aren't so steep that they'll break your heart. \nU.S. stock futures are shifting a bit lower. \nMost Asian markets are in negative territory. Stocks are mixed in Europe . \nThe lackluster action comes after U.S. stocks hit fresh record highs on Monday . \nThe Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 have both rallied by between 3% to 4% since the start of the year. The Nasdaq is up a whopping 7%. \nShares in iPhone maker Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) are trading near their highest level ever . \n2. Janet Yellen in the hot seat: Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen is giving semi-annual testimony to the U.S. Senate at 10 a.m. ET. \nThe Fed is considered the driving force behind the multi-year bull market rally in stocks since the Great Recession. \nWhat Yellen says about the timing and magnitude of future interest rate hikes could keep the rally going full steam ahead -- or stop it dead in its tracks. \nThe Fed last raised rates in December. \nBefore the Bell newsletter: Key market news.

Tech trouble: Toshiba's ( TOSYY ) chairman is stepping down as the firm revealed a $6.3 billion writedown at its troubled U.S. nuclear business. \nThe Japanese conglomerate missed its own deadline to report earnings earlier on Tuesday, sending shares down 8% in Tokyo. \nToshiba stock has lost about half its value since the company warned in December that it was expecting billion of dollars in nuclear-related losses. \nIn South Korea, prosecutors are again seeking an arrest warrant for the heir to the Samsung ( SSNLF ) business empire. \nLee Jae-yong , Samsung's de facto leader, has been under investigation as part of a huge political corruption scandal that has rocked South Korea. \nProsecutors are also seeking an arrest warrant for Samsung Electronics President Park Sang-jin. \nA judge will decide whether the arrest warrants are valid. \n4. Stocks to watch -- Credit Suisse, Rolls-Royce : Shares in Credit Suisse ( CS ) are rising by about 3% after the European bank said it would cut 5,500 jobs. It also reported that it lost 2.4 billion Swiss francs ($2.4 billion) in 2016. \nRolls-Royce ( RYCEY ) is having a tough day in London trading. Shares in the aircraft engine-maker fell by about 4% after the firm warned that pre-tax profits in 2016 were down 49%. \nThe British engineering giant said in January that it reached settlements with authorities in the U.K., the U.S. and Brazil over bribery allegations. These large settlements contributed to the drop in profit. \n5. Earnings and economics: Dr Pepper Snapple ( DPS ) , Molson Coors ( TAP ) , and T-Mobile ( TMUS ) are releasing earnings before the open Tuesday, while Caesars Entertainment ( CZR ) and Fossil ( FOSL ) plan to report earnings after the close. \nOn the economic front, new data shows the U.K. economy is experiencing higher inflation following its decision to leave the European Union .
