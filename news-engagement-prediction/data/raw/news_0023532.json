Image copyright AP Image caption The trapped eagle struggled to fly under the weight of the clamp \nMs Looker said the weight of the clamp will stop the bird from flying high enough to safety. \nShe also said the object will hamper the eagle from using its talons to hunt, eat and perch. \nSusan Boardman, who first spotted the bird and reported it to state game officials, said that \"without intervention, this eagle will probably die.\" \nShe said it struggled to fly away as she took its photo. \n\"It was heartbreaking to see him like this,\" she said. Image copyright AP Image caption Eagles, like these in British Columbia, use their talons for defence, eating, and perching \nAccording to the state Game Commission, leg-hold traps must not be set out in the open, where the bait can attract birds of prey. \nThe traps must also be staked down, and be labelled with the trapper's name. \nThey are commonly used on small game such as foxes, raccoons and bobcats. \nSetting traps illegally could result in criminal charges, said Travis Lau, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Game Commission. \nBald Eagles were placed on the endangered species list in 1978, but were removed once populations recovered, though it remains illegal to kill them. \nOn Tuesday a bald eagle in North Carolina was found shot in the head . \nOfficials there have asked anyone with any information to contact wildlife officials.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T22:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T18:12:10.510+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
