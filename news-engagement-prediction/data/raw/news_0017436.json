For example:why would youever put semen in your meals?And, more practically:does cum keep well in the fridge, ordo you need to harvest it on the spot?\nWhen I reached out toPaul, it turned out his fascination started in a pretty simple way.\"One dayI was in the kitchen with some friends,and the conversationveered towardssemen,\" he explained.\"I thought it would bequite natural to use it as a cooking liquid and I decided to try it myself. My passion for it began right there, and it hasn't waned since.\"\nAccording to Paul, consuming semen has many health benefits. It's true that there issome nutritional value to the fluid itincludes proteins,magnesium, potassium, sodiumand zinc andconsuming semen is evenassociated with a few medical benefits.A study by North Carolina University in 2003 found it decreases the risk of breast cancer, and there are studies that show swallowing their partner'ssperm hashelped toprevent preeclampsia in pregnant women. There's even a study suggesting that semen helps toalleviate morning sickness . Of course,if you choose to listen to these studies andthink it'sworthswallowingsperm because of its supposedhealth benefits, you need to knowwhose semen you'reswallowingso you don't end upcontracting an STI. That would be unfortunate andcounterproductive, to say the least.\nBecause I felt a strong urge to try some of his recipes out myself,I asked Paul forhis favourites.His personal all-time favourite is theMacho Mojito, acocktail made withrum, soda, mint, sugar and semen. He swears the taste is unique. I could imagine it would be, but decided to put it to the test.\nThe Macho Mojito \n\"You need fresh ingredients, so they still have all their nutrients,\"Paul explained. I gatheredfresh mint,a tablespoon of sugar, another tablespoon of powderedsugar, 15ml of lemon juice, lemon zest, 60mlof sodaand somesemen. \nI usually make my mojitos with cane sugar, but to not stray too far from the original recipe I usednormal sugar. Also: semen. I usually make my mojitos without semen.\nI mixed the sugar with the lemon juice, added the fresh mint and crushed the leaves in. I added zest, soda, rum, ice cubesand the final touch youguessed it semen.\n\nThe white liquid immediately swirled down through the glass. I'm not sure if it was supposed to happen,but as soon as the ice cubesstarted to melt theydilutedthe semenand my Macho Mojito started to pass for a less machomojito, i.e. a mojito without sperm in it.I could have easily treated my worst enemy to the festive cocktail and they never wouldhaveknown.\nIt did taste a bit weird at first, but I got used to it after a couple of sips. I have to be honest here it helped that I'm married to the semendonor. I'm not sure Icould have drunkthe cocktail if I hadn't had any idea where it came from. Thatmight be a psychological thing it just freaksme outwhen I don't know what I'm eating or drinking, whatever it is.\nHam, Cheese and Semen Crepes \nThe Macho Mojito was drinkable enough for me to want toexperimentwith semen a bit further. I chose a recipeofcrepes with ham, cheese and semen, which I made the day after the cocktail, to give my donor a littlebreather. Preparing the crepemixture was prettysimple I addedone egg toa cup of flourand another cup of milk. So far, so good.\n\nIt's a universal truth that the first crepe never comes out right. Minestubbornly stuck to the pan and Ihad to throw it away. The second one turned out fine, and when it was lightly golden on both sides I addedthe filling of ham, cheese and semen, and folded the crepe.\n\nThe smell ofheatedsemen and cheesemelting into the crepe made me gag. If it hadn't been for that very specific smell, the crepe could have easily passed for a semen-less one, because the semen was completely absorbed by the rest of the filling. That smell, though. Christ. There was no escaping it.After eating half of the crepe Idecided to save myself for dessert.\n\nWhich brings me to:\nSemen Flan \nI love pudding and I had never made a Spanish flan before, so this was a big moment for me. I liquified some sugar and poured that into a little dish. Secondly,I mixed milk, eggs, cinnamon and sugar with semen and poured that into the dish. I cooked it for a while, and then flipped the dish over. It had come apart a bit, but no matter. It was the effort that counted.\nIt was a proud moment for me, even though the memory of the fetid smell of hot semen nearly ruined it for me again. This time, however, the smell of cinnamon covered most of that up. And the flavour was fine a little too sweet for my taste, but not too weird or semen-y.\nTo besure, though, I will never use semen in a culinary way again. Whatever its apparenthealth benefits, I'll just stick to the struggle of trying to getthrough my normalfive-a-day. Fruit, veg that sort of thing.I've tried, and can say from experience:semenhas no place in my kitchen.\nMore on VICE: \nWe Asked a Male Porn Star How to Jizz Good \nCatching Up with Tracy Kiss, the Vlogger Who Pioneered the Semen Skincare Facial \nThe Cure for Your Semen Allergy Might Be Injections of Your Own Semen", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T15:19:19.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
