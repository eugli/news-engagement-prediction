Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nThere are no shortage of old wives tales which claim to predict your unborn baby's gender . \nIn those days before ultrasound scans , women came up with a surfeit of imaginative ways to (supposedly) determine if a mum-to-be was carrying a boy or a girl. \nPopular examples of enduring pregnancy 'lore' tell you carrying high means you're having a girl, as do mood swings, craving sweets, being sapped of your 'glow' and, oh joy, experiencing skin break-outs. \nYou may also - wait for it - just be experiencing common pregnancy symptoms, but that takes the fun out of guessing. However, there may in fact be a way of calculating if you are expecting a daughter. \nWhat's more, it doesn't involve dangling a ring on a piece of string over your tummy to see which way it swings. It's instead rooted in science and a mum-to-be's physiology. There's a theory that the position of the bump may reveal the sex of the baby (Photo: Getty) \nAccording to a recent study published in the journal Brain, Behaviour and Immunity , there is a relationship between a baby's sex and its mum's immunity. \n80 women were monitored over the course of their pregnancy and were examined to see if they showed different levels of immune markers called cytokines based on the sex of the foetus. \nThat was the main aim of the study, and although it didn't reveal the differences the researchers were looking for, something far more interesting and intriguing came to light. \nPrincipal investigator of the study, Amanda Mitchell is a postdoctoral researcher in the Institute for Behavioural Medicine Research at Ohio Stateâ€™s Wexner Medical Center .

Waiting until the 20 week scan is often the norm (Photo: Getty Images) \nAs a young girl, Melissa had suffered from allergies which eventually disappeared with age. \nHowever, these came back with a bang during her second pregnancy, resulting in Melissa having to take medication every day, such was the severity. \nIt's not unusual for women to experience allergy-like symptoms of pregnancy, but what was remarkable about Melissa's story was that these symptoms had not been present at all when she was expecting her son. \nThe two pregnancies were completely different, from cravings to extremity of morning sickness - and the allergies.
