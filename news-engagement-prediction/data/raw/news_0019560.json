REUTERS/Luke MacGregor \nSupport for Scottish independence rose after the British Prime Minister came out in favor of the UK making a clean break with the European Union, a BMG survey for Herald Scotland showed. \nThe survey indicated 49 percent of Scots support independence with 51 percent opposing it, after \"don't know\" votes are removed, the newspaper said. ( bit.ly/2kpldol ) \nA similar survey conducted last month showed roughly the same result as the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, with 45.5 percent in favor of independence and 54.5 percent against, the newspaper said. \nScotland's devolved parliament rejected British leader Theresa May's plan to exit the European Union in a symbolic, non-binding vote on Tuesday. \nScottish Greens lawmaker Ross Greer, who backs the devolved nationalist government on independence, told Reuters on Monday that Scotland was almost certainly headed to a new independence referendum after the UK triggers the process to leave the European Union. \n(Reporting by Rama Venkat Raman in Bengaluru; Editing by Bill Rigby) Next In World News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T09:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T04:04:29.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
