Robson said he weighed 122 kg when he started exercising, but had shed about 27 kgs over several years. \nREAD MORE: \n\"Five years ago it would have been an impossibility for me, I couldn't even swim.\" \nA lot of the group have swapped out bad habits for new ways, he said. \n\"Many of us don't drink any more, we've tidied up our acts. We enjoy each others' company in training sessions instead.\" \nTaranaki Toa aimed to get people off the couch to give it a go, he said. \n\"The emphasis of the group is getting inactive people to be active, its about trying to reverse an ugly trend, particularly for Maori, who are over represented in all the bad health statistics. This is the vehicle for us to help do that.\" \n\"Its about instilling confidence, conquering the demons in your own head telling you you can't do stuff, rising above your own expectations.\" \nIt was open to anyone and the group members come from all around Taranaki. \n\"Quite a few of our people are non-Maori, they embrace our message, they are supportive of what our kaupapa is about, less about competition and more about participation and promoting healthy lifestyles.\" \nThis was the largest group ever to go to the Taupo event. They would all be wearing Taranaki Toa uniforms but would participate as individuals, he said. \n\"This is the pinnacle event. That's not to say all of us are striving to complete an Ironman, but what it does demonstrate that with a lot of perseverance and hard work, anything is possible.\" \nThe Ironman event begins at 7am on Saturday and competitors need to complete the three events by midnight. \nThe Taranaki Toa team members and their families and supporters were heading to Taupo on Wednesday and would do a little light training together before the big day. \n\"It's pretty daunting, pretty exciting. It's going to be a long day,\" Robson said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T12:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T08:03:27.521+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
