Born perhaps of overstuffed Pinterest boards and selfie-laden Instagram feeds, the desire to cultivate one’s personal image has finally reached the underwear drawer. And as women rethink their unmentionables, scads of indie labels and mail-order lines are only too happy to oblige with new options that reflect their taste. Just in time for Valentine’s Day, no less. Photo The Great Eros in Williamsburg is all about the senses. Love God’s New Place \nIt’s up for debate whether the Williamsburg real estate market can get any hotter, but a new concept store in the Brooklyn ’hood is angling to add some sizzle. The Great Eros opened in December with a mission to celebrate the senses and sex positivity. That translates to a carefully curated selection of lingerie, latex, slippers, jewelry, fragrance, chocolates and sensual objects, including vintage erotic literature and commissioned nude artwork from Tanya Posternak. \nThe Great Eros, 135 Wythe Avenue, Brooklyn. Photo The Female Gaze \nMale gaze aside, some women just prefer lacy, come-hither lingerie. Lonely, an intimates label in Auckland, New Zealand, delivers the goods in a way that won’t give a feminist the heebie-jeebies. Though certainly sexy, the bras and panties have a subversive edge, augmented by the campaign models’ self-possessed attitudes and, occasionally, unshaven armpits. \nLonely underwire bra, $80, and high-waist briefs, $51, at lonelylabel.com . Photo Picture Imperfect \nA pair of tattered undergarments proved the unlikely inspiration for Marie Yeung’s lingerie line Marieyat, which specializes in deconstructed-meets-minimal styles in soft cotton rib. Besides making a great case for holding onto those worn, much-loved items, the unusual jumping-off point sets the tone for a collection that is all about celebrating imperfections. \nMarieyat ribbed cotton undergarments, from $40 for briefs to $200 for loungewear, at marieyat.com . Photo For Sleepwalkers \nNever has it been more acceptable to wear your PJs in public. Sleeper, a company founded in Ukraine by two former fashion editors, Kate Zubarieva and Asya Varetsa, bills itself as the first “walking sleepwear” brand. Among its chic options is this perfectly cut slip dress. \nSleeper bias-cut silk slip dress, $320 at Sleeper; thesleeper.com . Photo In Praise of Basics \nSometimes the simplest things are the hardest to find — like a good set of clean-cut underwear. Next Tuesday, Madewell will introduce its first underwear line, which aims to solve this dilemma. The classically-cut soft cotton, lace and mesh bralettes and panties come in an array of just-right colors and patterns (think: heather gray stripes, black, white and yellow). They’re the underthing equivalent of that one pair of sweatpants that gets the office dress code approval. \nMadewell cotton bralette, $32, and boy shorts, $12.50, at Madewell; madewell .com .
