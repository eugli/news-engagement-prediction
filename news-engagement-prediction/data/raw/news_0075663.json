Credit Patrick T. Fallon   Since Ken Bone is so 2016 , America needed a new everyman to rally behind. So, America asked: Who is Gary from Chicago? What we know is that he’s a lucky guy. He was among the people who walked into the auditorium at the Academy Awards, apparently fresh off of a tour bus, to rub elbows with Hollywood A-listers as the cameras rolled. One man in particular, who said his name was Gary and that he was from Chicago, got quite a bit of camera time. He looked the part of a tourist, wearing a hooded sweatshirt with “Hollywood” emblazoned across the chest, carrying a hefty bag in his right arm. And he made the most of his celebrity access. Standing next to Jimmy Kimmel, he kissed Nicole Kidman’s hand and shook Ryan Gosling’s. — Keith Urban (@KeithUrban) Feb. 27, 2017 Was it all a stunt? Is he a paid actor? We have no answers just yet, and any photos or videos he recorded on his iPhone, protected in a pink case, have not yet emerged on social media. \nAdvertisement But we do know that he’s going to have a good time when he gets back to Chicago. Offers of free stuff immediately rolled in. Gary from Chicago! We've got you covered if you want to come to a game! #Oscars — Chicago Bulls (@chicagobulls) Feb. 27, 2017 If anyone knows who #garyfromchicago is, have him tweet us because we want to give him some pizza #Oscars — Gino's East (@ginoseast) Feb. 27, 2017 When his fiancée said Denzel Washington was her favorite actor, Mr. Washington rose from his nearby seat for a mock wedding ceremony. “I now pronounce you husband and wife, kiss the bride,” he said. They obliged with a kiss.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T07:11:31.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
