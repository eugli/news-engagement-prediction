(Environment Canada)\nEnvironment Canada alerts issued at 4 p.m. Tuesday warned of hazardous winter conditions starting Wednesday night and lasting through much of Thursday.\nAt least 15 centimetres of snow is expected, more in the southeast of the province.\nThe warning said increasingly strong easterly winds and blowing snow, along with reduced visibility, would be problems into Thursday.\nPHOTO GALLERY: New Brunswick digging out from blizzard blast Keep digging: Monday's blizzard forces more closures into Tuesday New Brunswick's latest winter wallop in pictures The poor weather may contribute to transportation delays, said Environment Canada.\nResidents recover from Monday's snowfall \"Havoc, havoc, lots of havoc,\" was how Ron Bulmer described the aftermath of Monday's snowstorm.\nThe Fredericton garbage truck driver is working two shifts this week after the service was suspended during Monday's storm. Garbage will now also be collected on Saturday, he said.\nBulmer said it's not easy navigating the snow piles around the city, which are made worse by a thick sheet of ice below, a leftover from a major ice storm two weeks ago.\n\"It's like concrete,\" he said.\n\"We try to slow it down a little bit, and try to work with the public and maybe go a little extra, like dig that garbage can or dolly out of the snow, give them a break that way.\"\nBulmer was not the only one unhappy about the thick snow he had to navigate on Tuesday morning.\nSeveral people were shovelling and plowing for hours Monday evening and all through Tuesday.\nHabib Dable said he cleaned away the snow for most of his family in the past 24 hours.\n\"Charity, it's all charity, my parents, my grandparents, siblings, aunts and uncles, it's crazy,\" he said.\nRebekah Volk and Pauline Deschene, meanwhile, shovelled the inner gate to one of the city's dog parks, since the city plows the road but not the entryway to the park.\nVolk said she still loves winter, despite having to free her car from a whole snowbank this morning.\nDeschere did not entirely agree with her friend.\n\"I don't like winter, but you live in Canada, so suck it up!\" she said.\nWith files from Alan White", "external_links": ["https://weather.gc.ca/warnings/index_e.html?prov=nb"], "published": "2017-02-15T01:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:35:53.471+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
