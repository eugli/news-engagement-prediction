MAHB has to be responsible,” he told reporters when met at the handing over of duty ceremony of the Malaysian Drug Prevention Association (Pemadam) president here Wednesday. \nThe KLIA2 clip, lasting 2.33 minutes, was aired by a foreign broadcasting company and has gone viral on social media since Sunday. \nOn Feb 13, Jong-nam was in KLIA2 while waiting to board a flight to Macau when a woman suddenly covered his face with a cloth laced with what is believed to be poison. \nJong-nam, the elder half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, died while being rushed to Putrajaya hospital. – Bernama \nRelated stories: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T14:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:24:15.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
