Insisting that he continues to be the treasurer, Panneerselvam has written to banks not to allow anybody else to operate the party accounts without his consent. \n\nSasikala had appointed another senior leader Dindigul C Srinivasan as the treasurer. \n\nHitting back at Sasikala, Madhusudanan has written to the poll panel urging it to not to recognise her as AIADMK general secretary, saying she was not elected to the post as per party by-laws. \n\nMadhusudanan told reporters about the letter shortly before he was sacked from AIADMK by Sasikala for \"acting against the party\". \n\nAsserting that only cadres can elect a general secretary as per party rules, Madhusudanan said he had asked the EC not to recognise Sasikala as party chief. \n\nExpelled AIADMK Rajya Sabha member Sasikala Pushpa has already petitioned the EC against the election of V K Sasikala, saying it was not done as per procedure and the EC has sought the party's response to it. \n\n\"As per party by-laws, the general secretary can be elected only by cadres. As per rules, there is no temporary General Secretary post,\" Madhusudanan said. \n\nA candidate for the general secretary's post should also have completed at least five years in the party. \n\n\"Since Sasikala re-joined the AIADMK only on March 31, 2012, she does not qualify to become general secretary. I have requested Election Commission not to accept her appointment,\" he said. \n\nMeanwhile, a section of AIADMK MLAs owing allegiance to Sasikala have dismissed media reports and allegations by the Panneerselvam camp that they have been \"detained\" at a resort near here, and asserted that they were \"free\". \n\nV C Arukutty, MLA from Kavundampalayam in Coimbatore and a supporter of Panneerselvam, alleged that the MLAs had been \"detained\" and were \"not reachable.\" \n\n\"The MLAs are not reachable. They have been detained. They are legislators elected by people, so release them. Let them go and meet people,\" he told reporters here. \n\nHowever, the MLAs owing allegiance to Sasikala rejected the allegations. \n\n\"We are free. We are keenly awaiting Governor's invitation (to Sasikala to form government). We are not children to be detained or abducted as is being reported in a section of media,\" Perundurai MLA ND Venkadachalam said. \n\nResponding to reports that most of the MLAs were not reachable on the phone, Venkadachalam said he had switched off his mobile phone to avoid taking \"unnecessary calls,\" and speculations and \"wrong news.\" \n\nGudiyatham MLA Jayanti Padmanabhan also said she has not been detained as was being claimed by Panneerselvam loyalists. \n\nFormer minister and senior party leader B Valarmathi insisted that the MLAs were free and alleged they were being \"intimidated\" by those close to Panneerselvam. \n\n\"The MLAs are free. They are being intimidated by Panneerselvam's relatives over phone and that is why they have switched off their mobile phones,\" she said. \n\nMeanwhile, Srivaikundam MLA and former minister SP Shanmuganathan, a supporter of Panneerselvam, filed a police complaint here seeking to know the whereabouts of the legislators. \n\n\"There is no idea where the MLAs are,\" he said, adding that he has urged the police to find them. \n\nAs there was no word from Raj Bhavan about Sasikala's swearing-in even five days after she was elected AIADMK legislature party leader, party spokesperson Vaigaichelvan voiced confidence that she would take over the reins of the state soon. \n\n\"Chinnamma (Sasikala) had met the Governor yesterday. Good news will come soon. She will become Chief Minister,\" he asserted. \n\nHe also reiterated the party stand that DMK was behind Panneerselvam's revolt. \n\nMeanwhile, in an indication that the swearing-in might be further delayed, the venue of the ceremony today wore a desolate look even as the police security was withdrawn. \n\nSoon after Sasikala was elected AIADMK legislature party leader, the University of Madras auditorium was spruced up on a war-footing for her swearing-in. \n\nThe heavy police bandobust which was visible for the last few days is no more there and the premises wore a quiet look. \n\nEven the workers who were decking up the entry points are conspicuous by their absence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T17:20:50.363+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
