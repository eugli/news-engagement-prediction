It is premised on the individual as the basic unit of citizenship in terms of equality with every other citizen,\" Ansari pointed out. \n\n\"It therefore aspires towards a form of citizenship that is marked neither by universalism generated by complete homoenisation, nor by particularism generated by complete homogenisation, nor by particularism of self-identical and closed communities,\" he said. \n\n\"The operative principle for this is national-civic rather than 'national-ethnic' though a segment of opinion today would want to modulate or amend it and espouse instead an Indian version of 'cultural nationalism' premised on 'religious majoritarianism',\" he said without mincing any words. \n\nThese remarks hold significance amid highly charged election season.
