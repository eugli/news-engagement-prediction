Yet the government still plans to pay for large giveaways in the form of a higher income tax personal allowance at the basic and higher rate and was expected to maintain freezes on fuel duty that totalled £4.5bn a year.\nThe IFS said the promised spending and slower growth would force the government to implement tougher austerity, even though the chancellor has abandoned his predecessor’s pledge for a budget surplus by 2020.\nIt said: “Real levels of day-to-day public service spending have actually fallen very little overall in the last three years. The rate of reduction is set to speed up after this year, with cuts of nearly 4% due between 2016–17 and 2019– 20. \n“In addition, tax is rising as a share of national income and by 2019–20 is due to reach its highest level since 1986–87.”\n\nIt said a deficit in 2016-17 of 3.5% of GDP, or £68.2bn, was £12.7bn higher than the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, had predicted in March 2016. \nChancellor's looser finance targets highlight weaker UK economy Read more \n“This increase was not a result of a downgrade to the forecast for economic growth, but arose as a result of weak growth in tax receipts – in particular, income tax, National Insurance contributions (NICs) and stamp duty land tax – and faster growth in local authority spending,” it said.\nHammond said in the autumn statement last year that he plans to boost public investment spending beyond pre-crisis levels as a proportion of overall public spending, with much of the extra cash to be spent on transport infrastructure.\nHowever, many departments will need to make further savings on day-to-day spending by the end of the parliament.\nThe IFS said: “Public spending, especially on health, pensions and overseas aid will be higher as a share of national income than in 2007–08, while spending on schools, defence and (in particular) public order and safety will be lower.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T12:14:23.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
