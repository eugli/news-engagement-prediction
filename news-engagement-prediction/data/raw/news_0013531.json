But if you've been keeping your chocolate bars in the fridge, then stop at once. A new guide reveals exactly how to store every form of chocolate properly, from cocoa powder and chocolate chips for baking to chocolate bars and truffles for snacking. And it says to only keep chocolate bars in the fridge as a last resort if your kitchen is too warm. The golden rule? Keep it away from a heat source - for obvious reasons. But if you want your chocolate to taste the best it can, read FEMAIL Food&Drink's top tips on how long to keep it and how to best store your sweet treats below... The UK spends Â£4 billion on chocolate every year, while around the world, 3 million tonnes of cocoa are produced annually to satisfy the global demand for the sweet treat THE BEST WAY TO STORE CHOCOLATE Chocolate bars: Bars need to be kept between 15C (60F) and 21.1C (70F) - a cool room temperature. They also need to be stored away from sunlight - a cool pantry or cupboard is ideal. If your kitchen gets too warm, you can keep it in the fridge but make sure you wrap it up tightly to prevent any odours from spoiling the taste or condensation from spoiling the texture. Chocolate chips: Chocolate chips contain less cocoa butter than normal chocolate and can therefore withstand higher temperatures. But they're still best kept at the same temperature as your chocolate bars and in a similarly dark place. Keep them away from sunlight and tightly sealed. Chocolate truffles: Shop bought truffles should also be kept at the same cool room temperature, away from sunlight and in a dark pantry. But if you've made them yourself using fresh cream, then these need to be stored in an airtight container in the fridge. Cocoa powder: A cool, dark place at room temperature is the best place for cocoa powder. It needs to be kept in an airtight container. Never keep it in the fridge as it will spoil.
