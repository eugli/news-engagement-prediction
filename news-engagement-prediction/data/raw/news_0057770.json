Credit Mario Anzuoni/Reuters Caitlyn Jenner, perhaps the most influential transgender activist in the country, joined a growing chorus of critics who have denounced President Trump’s decision to rescind protections that allowed transgender students to use the bathroom of their choice. Ms. Jenner, an Olympic gold medalist and reality television star, delivered a blunt warning to Mr. Trump in a video posted on Twitter on Thursday. “This is a disaster,” she said, adding, “See you in court.” That statement echoed the president’s declaration on Twitter after his travel ban on immigrants from certain nations was blocked by the courts. Ms. Jenner’s rebuke raised the level of opposition, and not only because of her high profile. She is a lifelong Republican and an early supporter of Mr. Trump’s when he was still thought to be a long shot to win the party’s nomination. She said in June that she thought Mr. Trump would support gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender issues: “He seems very much behind the L.G.B.T. community.” Ms. Jenner, 67, also attended some of the festivities surrounding his presidential inauguration in January. Well @realDonaldTrump , from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Call me. pic.twitter.com/XwYe0LNUOq — Caitlyn Jenner (@Caitlyn_Jenner) Feb. 24, 2017 Ms. Jenner credited Mr. Trump last summer for breaking with other Republicans in not supporting a law in North Carolina that barred people from using public bathrooms that did not correspond with their biological sex.
