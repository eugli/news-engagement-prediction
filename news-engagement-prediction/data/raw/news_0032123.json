Older lifts and escalators will need to be modernised with up-to-date safety features. So there will be an increasing need for skilled engineers and technicians,\" Mr Lee said at the Building Constructiom Authority (BCA) - Industry Built Environment ITE Scholarship award ceremony. \nRISING PRESSURE TO DEVELOP MANPOWER \nOn the same day, BCA and industry partners also signed a MOU to ensure that the sector continues to offer attractive and relevant jobs, with companies signing on committing to attract locals into the sector by supporting scholarship and sponsorship programmes. \nThe need to develop manpower here has been growing. Mr Sugumaran N. Pillai, president of the Singapore Lift and Escalator Contractors and Manufacturers Association, said: \"Majority of the existing people are getting old so we need replacement for these people. So it's two aspects: One is to get replacement for the existing people, the other is to bring in more people for the long term.\" \nHowever, Mr Lim Teck Lee, deputy principal in academic at ITE College East, said the lack of prospects in the lift and escalator industry continues to turn away students from pursuing a career in it. \n\"For ITE, our graduates are currently averaging S$1,900 per month. The lift and Escalator industry, on average, our students' starting salary is about S$2,200 to S$2,500. This is an area that can be improved on,\" said Mr Lim. \nIndustry insiders had earlier gave their views on difficulties in attracting talent into the sector, citing a lack of interest in the job. \nMs Mary Kok, head of Mitsubishi Elevator Singaporeâ€™s Human Resource and Admin Division, for one, had said that not many people are interested in this line of work , and it is also competing with other industries such as engineering, building services and transportation for local talent. \nThis comes amid a tightening of regulations on lift maintenance , as announced by the BCA last June, after a string of lift-related incidents that happened that saw a 59-year-old woman injuring her spine and an elderly man who died from a fall when a lift stopped above the ground causing his wheelchair to topple. - CNA/kk", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T15:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:06:22.392+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
