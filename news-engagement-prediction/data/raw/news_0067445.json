LaPierre says they're facing people willing to use violence against them.\nSocial media users mockingly asked where they could earn $1,500 a week to protest, saying they've been protesting for free.\n@mattdpearce $6k a month to protest?! Sign me up for that part-time job. I'd even make my own graphics.\n@mattdpearce Do they have 401k matching and dental too?
