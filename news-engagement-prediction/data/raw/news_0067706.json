We've picked out a whole slate for you to check out, from movies that are up for Academy Awards , movies that we wish were up for Academy Awards, and a couple of offbeat picks that are almost certainly too hardcore for the Academy Awards. Enjoy. \nIf you want to check out some current nominees: There aren't a whole bunch of these on Netflix, but you can catch a few, mostly in categories other than Best Picture—Ava DuVernay's best documentary nominee The 13th , animated feature nominee Zootopia , and visual effects nominee The Jungle Book are among the few current nominees streaming on the service. Beyond Netflix, the pool gets a little wider. O.J. : Made In America is available on Hulu as a lengthy trilogy of movies, and while you can't find any current Oscar nominees on Amazon Prime, you can check out a great film we wish was nominated there: The Witch EDITOR’S PICK Moonlight’s Mahershala Ali Picks His Own Oscar Winners \nIf you're in a movie mood, but want something newer: This week's biggest Netflix original is I don't feel at home in this world anymore , a film directed by Macon Blair, the star of excellent (and streaming) thrillers Blue Ruin and Green Room . The film stars Elijah Wood as the friend of a nurse who's absolutely fed up with everyone in the world being an asshole, and decides to do something about it. Probably something violent. \nHow bout a horror flick? Check out The Hallow , an indie horror film about a London man who moves his family into a mill house to get away from it all, only to discover the forest is full of children-eating demons. According to our own Tom Phillip, it's \"really great low-budget horror with lots of dread and Irish accents,\" which doesn't sound like a bad way to spend a movie night.
