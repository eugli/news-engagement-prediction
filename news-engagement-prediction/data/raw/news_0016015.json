(AFP) \nFour people were killed and more than 40 others injured after fire erupted at a shopping centre in South Kore, authorities have said. \nPolice suspect that sparks from a welding torch might have started the fire on Saturday (local time) in a kids' play area in the mall in Dongtan, a commuter town south of Seoul. \nTwo of the four people who died were builders and the others were a mall worker and a shopper. Police suspect the blaze was sparked by a welding torch. (AFP) \nMost of the 47 people injured complained of smoke inhalation. \nThe play area was closed at the time of the fire. \nFire authorities urged builders to follow safety regulations, noting that welding torches were blamed for past blazes. \nPrevious incidents include a December 2008 warehouse fire in the eastern city of Icheon that claimed eight lives and a shopping mall blaze at a bus terminal in Koyang, north of Seoul, which killed nine and injured 60.
