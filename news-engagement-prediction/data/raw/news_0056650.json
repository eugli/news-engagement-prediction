Daily production will vary depending on the weather. \nFrance said the solar panel road was the first of its kind and will be assessed after a two-year test period to determine its effectiveness. Churches urged to get help from above via solar panels \nThe country hopes to cover 1,000km (620 miles) of roadways with solar panels. \nBosses described the new road as a “real opportunity for our innovation” but critics argued the Government has spent too much money on the project.
