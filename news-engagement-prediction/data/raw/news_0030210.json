Antibiotic resistance just became more complex December 27, 2016 \nBacteria that are susceptible to antibiotics can survive when enough resistant cells around them are expressing an antibiotic-deactivating factor. This new take on how the microbial context can compromise antibiotic therapy ... A new way of fighting bacteria? February 22, 2016 \nIn bacteria, toxin-antitoxin systems consist of a set of two closely linked genes. Situated on the same chromosome, they encode both a protein 'poison' and a counteracting 'antidote'. Under normal conditions, the antitoxin ... Collisions during DNA replication and transcription contribute to mutagenesis June 29, 2016 \nWhen a cell makes copies of DNA and translates its genetic code into proteins at the same time, the molecular machinery that carries on replication and the one that transcribes the DNA to the mRNA code move along the same ... New mechanisms of 'social networking' in bacteria April 7, 2015 \nBacteria have traditionally been viewed as solitary organisms that \"hang out on their own,\" says molecular biologist Kevin Griffith of the University of Massachusetts Amherst. However, scientists now realize that in fact, ... New leads on mechanisms that confer virulence to E.coli-type bacteria December 9, 2011 \nA team headed by scientists from the IRB Barcelona reports how the protein Ler, which is found in pathogenic bacteria, interacts with certain DNA sequences, thereby activating numerous genes responsible for virulence, which ... Recommended for you How to be a successful pest: Lessons from the green peach aphid February 13, 2017 \nUK Scientists, in collaboration with groups in Europe and the US, have discovered why the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) is one of the most destructive pests to many of our most important crops. Their research will inform ... Chemical engineers boost bacteria's productivity February 13, 2017 \nMIT chemical engineers have designed a novel genetic switch that allows them to dramatically boost bacteria's production of useful chemicals by shutting down competing metabolic pathways in the cells. Impact of climate change on mammals and birds 'greatly under-estimated' February 13, 2017 \nAn international study published today involving University of Queensland research has found large numbers of threatened species have already been impacted by climate change. New tool can help researchers identify enzymes—and their abundance—in microbiomes February 13, 2017 \nFor researchers studying the possible connections between human health and the trillions of microbes that inhabit our digestive tract, what makes the work so exciting is also what makes it challenging. Making single-cell RNA sequencing widely available February 13, 2017 \nSequencing messenger RNA molecules from individual cells offers a glimpse into the lives of those cells, revealing what they're doing at a particular time. However, the equipment required to do this kind of analysis is cumbersome ... New protein discovery may lead to new, natural antibiotics February 13, 2017 \nScientists have discovered a new protein that likely will advance the search for new natural antibiotics, according to a study by Texas A&M AgriLife Research published Feb. 13 in the journal Nature Microbiology.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T18:39:07.829+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
