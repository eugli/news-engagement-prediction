Laura Blackburn (Photo: Roland Leon/The People) \nWhile in the coma her distraught partner Allan was told she had a FIVE PER CENT chance of survival and her only hope was a to join the queue for a specialist life support machine at a hospital 50 miles away. \nMeanwhile premature 3lb 6oz Jack was enduring his own brush with death as a swollen bowel forced doctors to stop feeding him for 10 days. Read More Brave mum with swine flu forced to give birth while unconscious to premature baby at only 26 weeks \nFrantic Allan had to dash from one to the other across two counties, ­terrified he would lose one or both. \nAnd when Laura finally came round five weeks later after winning her fight against pneumonia, blood poisoning and internal bleeding, she thought she was still pregnant – until the moment she was shown a photo of her son. \nNow she is looking forward to Jack’s first birthday on March 2 after ­“missing” his entry into the world in a drama that left her so shattered and debilitated she had to learn how to walk again. Jack Blackburn (Photo: Roland Leon/The People) \nCuddling the giggling youngster on their sofa, Laura says: “I didn’t know where I was when I woke up. I couldn’t talk and I couldn’t move as my muscles deteriorated while I was in the coma. \n“When the nurses moved me, I mouthed at them to mind my bump. Then they showed me pictures of Jack. I was in shock, I was petrified.” \nAllan, 34, says of his tearful ordeal: “When I was with one, I felt guilty I wasn’t with the other. \n\"There didn’t seem to be any light at the end of the tunnel. You start to think, what ­happens if one of them doesn’t make it? What happens if neither do?” \nYet a few months earlier the couple had cried tears of joy when Laura found she was pregnant in 2015 after a year trying to conceive. His mum didn't know she'd had a son for weeks (Photo: Roland Leon/The People) \nThey even asked the sonographer to write the sex of the baby in a card and hung it on their Christmas tree to open with Jack’s big sister Hollie, nine, on Christmas Day. \nLaura says: “It was the best possible present. We all wanted a boy, so we were over the moon. Everything seemed to be going perfectly.” \nThat changed when she developed a cough at work as a senior drug treatment practitioner last March. Within days she began coughing up blood and her oxygen levels were dangerously low. \nLaura, of Ecton, Northants, was rushed to Northampton General Hospital, but doctors struggled to ­pinpoint her ­mutated strain of swine flu and she deteriorated until their only option was an emergency caesarean. Medics delivered Jack, but Laura had to be put into a coma in intensive care. Mum and son reunited (Photo: Roland Leon/The People) \nAllan had to wait while Jack was stabilised before meeting his son. He says: “I was allowed to hold his head, but that’s all. \n\"I was so happy to see him, but it was hard to get ­excited when I knew Laura was so ill. I took some bibs in and rested them on Laura to get her smell, then put them next to Jack so he’d recognise her when they met. \n“The first time I held him he was six days old. I couldn’t believe how small and fragile he felt.” \nMeanwhile, Laura was finally ­diagnosed, but doctors weren’t sure if the standard drug Tamiflu would treat her strain of swine flu. \nShe also ­developed pneumonia twice and blood poisoning – and her survival chance had dropped to just 5%. Jack with dad and big sister (Photo: Roland Leon/The People) \nHer only hope was an ECMO heart and lung bypass life support machine 50 miles away in Leicester, but there was a waiting list. \nAs the days passed, Laura’s family were repeatedly taken into a side room to warn them time was running out. \nAfter two weeks, her heart stopped and doctors had to pump it themselves. \nMercifully, an ECMO machine became available that day, but Laura was now so ill she was thought unlikely to survive the journey. \nAudi salesman Allan says: “I had to sign a consent form allowing her to be moved. It said it was her last chance of life. That’s all I needed to see. We had to try.” Read More \nLaura spent another three weeks in a coma at Leicester Glenfield Hospital and suffered internal bleeding in her uterus and her right leg, which doctors feared they might have to amputate. \nDoctors warned Allan they might take Laura off the ECMO machine after a week. \nBut when a dreaded call came through on his phone, it was to tell him Jack was ­seriously ill with a swollen bowel. \nHe says: “It all just kept getting worse.” Laura is lucky to be alive (Photo: Roland Leon/The People) \nThen both mum and son started to turn a corner in their fight for survival. \nDoctors eventually decided to wake Laura from her five-week coma – but it was a slow process and when she became too distressed, they had to put her back to sleep. \nLaura says: “I was on so many drugs that every time they woke me up I forgot what they told me about Jack. They had to explain everything to me all over again.” \nAfter several days recovering her strength, Laura was finally allowed to see her children – Hollie first, then Jack. \nLaura says: “I remember thinking Hollie had grown since I last saw her. You could see she was scared. She was thinking, ‘what’s happened to my ­mummy, why can’t she talk’. \n\"And I ­remembered two hallucinations from my coma. In one I was in a war. It was vivid, I was surrounded by bullets and bombs going off. I was fighting for my life. Laura with husband Allan, daughter Hollie and baby Jack (Photo: Roland Leon/The People) \n“The other was all about Hollie. I was terrified of leaving my little girl. I had to be there for her. \n“When I saw Jack for the first time I was so relieved. But I couldn’t talk to him and I couldn’t hold him or feed him because I couldn’t move my arms. \nIn the end Laura made a remarkable recovery. \nShe says: “The first time I was able to give Jack a bottle was a massive moment. It showed me I could still care for him. Until that point, I was scared what kind of mum I could be to him.” \nLaura had ­intensive therapy and quickly mastered the use of her hands and her legs again. \nBy July, just two months after waking from her coma, she was back in the gym and in November she completed the 10km Leeds Abbey Dash to raise £3,000 to fund more ECMO machines. She has also returned to work. Laura with husband Allan Pilley, Hollie and baby Jack (Photo: Roland Leon/The People) \nLaura says: “Everything feels so ­normal now. I have mild scarring on my lungs, but the doctors say it will be gone in a year. The doctors and nurses were incredible. People need to realise how lucky we are to have the NHS.” \nLaura certainly counts herself lucky to be alive. “We had so much taken away from us. Allan didn’t see his baby being born and I missed so much time with Jack. \n\"Nothing can give us those memories back, but we are just grateful we are together now. We know how close we came to losing everything.” Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:39:28.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
