America needed a functioning, nine-member high court long ago, and it needs one even more badly now, as the Trump administration looks poised to continually test its constitutional authority. \nJudge Neil Gorsuch — a conservative appellate judge in the mold of the late Antonin Scalia who, at 49, is poised to serve decades on the court — will surely activate liberal opposition. \nHe considers himself an originalist whose job is to interpret the meaning of those who drafted the nation’s founding documents. That’s anathema to the “living document” school of interpretation. \nHis criticism of a landmark 1984 ruling against the Chevron oil company has made him a hero of those who oppose what they perceive as federal regulatory overreach. \nHe is a foe, though it’s unclear how staunch, of abortion rights, and of gun safety laws. \nHe — correctly — dissented from a ruling that upheld provisions of the Affordable Care Act forcing religious groups to choose between their faith and federal law. \nNo one has ever questioned Gorsuch’s intellect or qualifications. A graduate of Columbia, Harvard and Oxford, he clerked for two Supreme Court justices and served in the Department of Justice and at a top law firm before beginning a 10-year appeals court stint. \nHe is esteemed by leading liberal legal lights. Obama’s former ethics czar called him “a great guy”; law professor Laurence Tribe, an Obama mentor, called him “as smart as he is conservative, and he writes elegantly.” \nWhile Gorsuch is hardly our ideological ideal, he is a high-caliber mind who stands solidly in the mainstream of conservative jurisprudence. \nBarring unforeseen revelations — or a partisan blockade that would be as hypocritical as it is destructive — his journey from Judge Gorsuch to Justice Gorsuch is easy to envision.
