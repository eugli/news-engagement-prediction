Related Content Governor Mbugua under fire over jobs \nOFFICIALS SUMMONED \nA county assembly committee chaired by Gilgil Ward MCA Jane Ngugi had summoned board chairman Waithaji Mutiti, Secretary James Mbugua and board executive Margaret Kitetu to explain the anomalies. \nThe jobs were advertised in local dailies in 2014 but the hiring took place in 2016 and letters were issued in January 2017. \nIn a stormy debate at a meeting of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee, Subukia MCA Mwangi Waithaka said it was improper for the board to recruit high school students when there were many other qualified candidates. \nRECRUITMENT A SHAM \n“This recruitment is a big sham as some of the successful candidates in the list tabled by the board were actually in high school and never applied for the positions,” said Mr Mwangi. \nHowever, Dr Waititi denied the claims, saying due process was followed in recruiting the officers. \nAt one stage, the meeting was thrown into disarray when it was reduced into a shouting match and name-calling. \nCommittee vice-chairperson Emma Wambui Mbugua and Free Area MCA Humphrey Mwaniki exchanged abusive words when the latter claimed the enforcement jobs were not meant for disabled people. \nMs Mbugua, who represents disabled people in the assembly, accused the board of discriminating against them during recruitment. \n“I am not a flower girl in this assembly and the disabled are also members of this county and deserve respect and equal job opportunities like any other able persons,” she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:51:36.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
