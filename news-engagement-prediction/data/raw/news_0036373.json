Monthly jobs ups and downs just 'noise' \nThe participation rate - the proportion of the adult population in work or looking for it - also declined slightly from 64.7 to 64.6 per cent. \nDespite the surge in part-time work, the bureau's estimate of monthly hours worked rose by 0.6 per cent in January. ABC business reporter Michael Janda explains how the jobs data are calculated and what to look for in the figures. \nThe more stable trend figures - smoothed over several months to reduce volatility - put unemployment at 5.7 per cent for the ninth straight month, painting what is probably an accurate picture of a reasonably stagnant labour market. \nDeutsche Bank economist Adam Boyton said the figures taken as a whole show the jobs market is continuing to head sideways, with little improvement or decline. \n\"Stepping back from the month-to-month noise in these data, we note that the broad trend in the unemployment rate appears to be moving sideways,\" he wrote in a note on the data. \n\"Indeed, we expect the unemployment rate to trend sideways (of course with the usual noise one sees in these data) for some time.\" First posted February 16, 2017 11:37:04 Top Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T07:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T03:36:58.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
