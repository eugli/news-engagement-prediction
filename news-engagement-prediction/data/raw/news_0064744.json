So the No. 88 Hendrick Motorsports driver said he was surprised by the mixed reviews his personal immigration tweet - in response to a NASCAR fan - received.\n@GelarBudidarma my fam immigrated from Germany in 1700s escaping religious persecution. America is created by immigrants.\nâ€” Dale Earnhardt Jr. (@DaleJr) January 29, 2017 As Earnhardt explained, he hoped to help the racing fan in Indonesia \"feel better at a time when he was distraught and upset\" over President Donald Trump's immigration ban on people from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\nBut for Junior, there's more to it.\nHe said he felt connected to this particular topic after researching his family's own history and roots, tracing them back to Germany in the 1700s. He learned his family was fleeing religious persecution and had no choice but to leave their home in 1744.\n\"I just can't image what that must have been like to have to get on this ship for months to sail across the ocean in terrible conditions that people weren't even surviving - just awful illnesses and so forth on these boats that were killing people,\" he said Tuesday. \"Then they'd get there with nothing really and have to start over.\"\nWhile digging through his family's history, Earnhardt also proposed to his now-wife, Amy , in a 300-year-old, German church where his ancestors worshiped generations ago.\n\nIn today's political climate, Earnhardt said he doesn't worry about \"stirring up too much dust\" on social media when he's confident in his knowledge on a particular subject.\nAlthough his research was \"completely overwhelming\" at points, he said he'd still love to investigate more. And as he continues to learn about his family's own immigration story, he becomes more grateful.\n\"I guess what that makes me think is how many instances there must have been in just the last 300 years - that's really all I researched - where if one thing had happened differently, I wouldn't be here,\" Earnhardt said. \"If one person hadn't met this person, or if this person didn't make this trip or this person didn't go to this state or whatever, I wouldn't be here.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:34:45.827+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
