I think that's the sort of questions that need to be asked,\" Ms Johnston told 9NEWS. \nPremier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the courts would help deliver justice. \n\"I want to see justice just as much as every other Queenslander does and justice will be achieved through the courts,\" she said. \nSix million dollars has also been allocated so that government departments can better communicate, and further information is expected be released in a couple of weeks when the Commissioner reveals what happened in the case of Caboolture toddler Mason Lee in June last year. \nThe government has said that the year's deaths were five fewer than were recorded in the year before.
