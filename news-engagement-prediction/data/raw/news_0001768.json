Media: MediaOS Video \nMore than 100 protesters on Friday evening chanted, drummed and danced out their vehement opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration policies during a loud but peaceful protest stationed outside the Galleria. \nToting \"Resist Trump\" and \"Black Lives Matter\" signs, the growing crowd chanted \"hands too small, can't build a wall\" and rapped out anti-Trump chants inspired by the rapper Ludacris, even as a strong police presence monitored the pre-Super Bowl protest from nearby. \nThe diverse protest coalition included members of the Houston Socialist Movement, #FightFor15 supporters, a handful of anarchists, representatives from Familias Inmigrantes y Estudiantes en the Lucha and a slew of other activist groups speaking out against Trump's plans to build a southern border wall and his controversial move to ban immigrants from seven majority Muslim countries. \n\"We're the ones who contributed to America. We're the ones who built America,\" said Isaias Sapon,\" a Guatemalan immigrant who moved stateside in 1990. \nBetween speakers, the enthusiastic crowd broke out into chants, shouting, \"From Palestine to Mexico, border walls have got to go,\" and the ever-popular, \"No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA.\" Photo: Jon Shapley, Houston Chronicle Image 1 of / 10 Close Image 1 of 10 Eric McClaskey yells anti-Donald Trump slogans during a protest at the intersection of Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, Friday, Feb. 3, 2017, in Houston. \"The system's not broken, it's built this way,\" he said. less Eric McClaskey yells anti-Donald Trump slogans during a protest at the intersection of Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, Friday, Feb. 3, 2017, in Houston. \"The system's not broken, it's built this way,\" ... more Photo: Jon Shapley, Houston Chronicle Image 2 of 10 A protester listens as people share stories and lead anti-Trump chants during a protest at the intersection of Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, Friday, Feb. 3, 2017, in Houston.

He started out cleaning Pizza Hut parking lots and worked his way into owning IHOP restaurants that employ more than 500 workers. \n\"He's my version of the American Dream,\" Hamideh said. \"Immigrants are the best of us.\" \nAlthough the raucous rally stayed peaceful, some advocated for more forceful actions in the future. \n\"We're becoming basically a Nazi, white, fascist America,\" said protest regular Erik McClaskey, who covered his face with a black bandanna in response to what he described as \"police profiling.\" \n\"It'd be awesome if we could have a peaceful revolution but how many peaceful revolutions have you seen in history?\" \nThe small Friday action was just the first in what's expected to be a busy weekend of protests. \nOn Saturday, a crowd is set gather at City Hall for a 3 p.m. protest, while the following day a march from Hermann Park will kick off around noon and an #OccupyTheSuperBowl rally will start at NRG Park at 2 p.m.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T08:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T04:30:15.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
