The 45-year-old actress called their act uncool and asked them to pick on someone their own age. \n\"He who laughs last, laughs alone. Pick on someone your own size boys! This is so NOT cool!\" she posted on the social media. \nFew days after the Delhi University’s (DU) Ramjas college saw violent clashes between student groups, Gurmehar - a Lady Sri Ram College (LSRC) student initiated a social media campaign targeting Bhartiya Janta Party’s (BJP) student outfit Akhil Bhartiya Vidhyarthi Parishad (ABVP). He who laughs last,laughs alone. Pick on someone your own size boys! This is so NOT cool! https://t.co/jJ5gAe53gh \n— Pooja Bhatt (@PoojaB1972) February 28, 2017 \nThis started when Sehwag tweeted a picture which allegedly mocked her campaign. Randeep then supported Sehwag's tweet with a reaction which is being highly slammed by the cyber citizens.
