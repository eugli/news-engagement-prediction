Pam Panchak/Post-Gazette The Mike Feinberg Co. in the Strip. By Tim Grant / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nThe legendary Mike Feinberg Co., one of Pittsburgh’s favorite stores for party supplies, Steelers gear and souvenirs, will be shutting its doors the end of April after 60 years at its location on Penn Avenue in the Strip District. \nMarcia Feinberg, daughter of the store’s founder Mike Feinberg, said the family made an agonizing decision a few days ago to sell the building and retire the business. \nThe family would not disclose who purchased the three-story building, which is valued by the Allegheny County Property Assessor at $565,200 for tax purposes. \n“People are a little shocked,” she said. “They have been asking why we are shutting down. They can’t believe it. People have been coming in and wondering where will they get certain things we sell.” \nThe merchandise that Mike Feinberg Co. has carried for decades is a mishmash of party supplies, costumes, sports paraphernalia and many novelties that are uniquely Pittsburgh. \nCustomers from all over the region and beyond have made Mike Feinberg Co. a busy shopping destination, especially on Saturdays preceding Steelers games. Ms. Feinberg said she knows closing day will leave a hole in the fabric of the city. \n“There will definitely be a void in this area for what we carry,” she said. \nWhile the store is usually closed on Sundays, March 26, will be an exception. \nMayor Bill Peduto will issue a proclamation making it “Mike Feinberg Day” in the Strip District. The day also happens to be Mike Feinberg’s birthday. He died in January 2007. \n“We will be open that Sunday for a big party with special sales, balloons and candy to celebrate my dad’s birthday and the legacy of his company,” Ms. Feinberg said. \nTim Grant: tgrant@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1591.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T12:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:31:20.525+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
