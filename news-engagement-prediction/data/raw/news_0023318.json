It’s a small but sure-to-be-appreciated change that should reduce the frustration of making a detour to a Supercharger, only to find all the charging stalls filled up. The information is available in the map app of the center screen in Model S and Model X vehicles.\nLate last year, Tesla began charging a fee to owners who left their cars at Superchargers after they had completed charging. The fee — which is $0.40 cents per minute in the US if a car remains at a station for more than five minutes after charging is completed — is meant to encourage turnover at Tesla’s charging facilities.\n@elonmusk @ElonMuskNewsOrg brilliant update to Tesla Sat Nav charger info. #topteam #tesla #supercharger #dundee #Acleanfuture pic.twitter.com/yDDb3uV52P \n— John van Dieken (@doubledutch13) February 8, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T01:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:05:52.223+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
