Picture: Donato Sardella/WireImage\nThe model — along with fellow LA-based Aussie, stylist Tamie Ingham — launched the brand in 2013.\nThe intense scrutiny surrounding her new relationship won’t be entirely new territory. Before meeting Stefanovic, Yarbrough dated Australian Wallabies player Drew Mitchell on and off for years.\nmedia_camera Yarbrough with ex-boyfriend Drew Mitchell.\nThe couple is now reportedly planning to attend Pete Stefanovic’s wedding to Sylvia Jeffreys in April.\nMeanwhile, Stefanovic’s mother Jenny experienced an awkward moment over the weekend, after being papped at a Sydney Woolworths holding a newspaper with pictures of her son and his girlfriend canoodling splashed across the front page.\nmedia_camera This a little awkward. Picture: Diimex\nThere’s been plenty of interest in Stefanovic’s love life since news broke of his separation from Thorburn late last year.\nOver the past few months, he’s been linked to a number of women, including Delta Goodrem and engaged Melbourne food blogger Sofia Levin.\nAfter New Idea claimed the pair had become close following her appearance on Today , she was forced to confront the rumours.\n“It’s not true at all, we’re just friends,” she told Woman’s Day .\n“We’re just mates and have stayed in contact since that shoot [on Today ].”\nStefanovic has remained pretty tight-lipped about his private life since the split, but recently opened up to the Herald Sun about the toll it’s taken on his family .\n“For me personally I would definitely have failures in a husband sense and hope that I can rectify my failures as a dad,” Karl told the publication.\n“I hope I can try and rebuild whatever has happened in the past and try and make the most of what I can do with them in the future.”\nStefanovic and Thorburn have three kids together: Jackson, 16, Ava, 11, and River, 10.\nWhile the split hasn’t been easy for the couple, Stefanovic admits it’s also been extremely hard on their children.\n“For me the only issue was the burden of paparazzi around my family in the initial months. That is regrettable, that is hard to explain to a kid and I think it is awful for kids,” he said.\nHowever, Stefanovic now appears to be feeling more positive about the situation.\n“Life is life. People make mistakes. People have break ups. People mostly try to do their best and sometimes they fail,” he said.\n“I think that we will work through it as best we can.”\nOriginally published as Who is Karl Stefanovic’s new girlfriend?", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/51fa2cf1a4322c8b8b1fe934f50c2338?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/269ec1d011e4cfa404f7800b7ff5fbca?width=650", "http://www.heraldsun.com.au/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7d9e0e32134a1c18368eeff9e2866ba5?width=650", "http://www.nowtolove.com.au/celebrity/celeb-news/sofia-levin-denies-romance-with-karl-stefanovic-24395", "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/7776441e43c82cc7aed501c0c7a98d8b?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/morning-shows/karl-stefanovic-reportedly-splits-up-with-wife-cassandra-thorburn/news-story/0304a086f1490d60d16480f3603a8f21", "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/hook-ups-break-ups/who-is-karl-stefanovics-new-girlfriend-jasmine-yarbrough/news-story/7776441e43c82cc7aed501c0c7a98d8b"], "published": "2017-02-19T20:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T10:33:51.522+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
