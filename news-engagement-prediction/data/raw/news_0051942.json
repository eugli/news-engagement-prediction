Credit Jehad Nga To the Editor: Phil Klay writes powerfully of the values that guide American military forces in combat in Iraq (“ What We’re Fighting For ,” Sunday Review, Feb. 12). Our fighting men and women are indeed brave and honorable. Yet their valor and the exercise of principles even in the heat of combat do not answer the question, What are we fighting for? Despite these principles, the armed forces of the United States and its allies have killed tens if not hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, a large number of them civilians, including women and children. And our country has suffered the death and injury of tens of thousands of our own sons and daughters, fathers and mothers, husbands and wives by waging this war in Iraq. But for what purpose? We know that there were no weapons of mass destruction threatening our peace and security. We had no plan to bring peace and security to Iraq and its neighbors. So yes, our soldiers and sailors are valiant and represent the best in our country, but I still do not know what we’re fighting for. MICHAEL E.
