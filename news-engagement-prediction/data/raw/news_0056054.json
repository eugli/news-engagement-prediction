This user had shared quite a few various leaks lately, and this is one of the clearest images of the Galaxy S8 that we’ve seen thus far, and the design of the phone actually resembles pretty much all the other leaks that have surfaced recently. \nNow, this image actually shows us something others did not, all three on-screen buttons on the Galaxy S8. We’ve seen the phone’s back and home key thus far, and now we get to see its overview (multitasking button), and all three buttons in one place. Samsung will not use Google’s stock buttons in the Galaxy S8, it seems, the company had opted to design their very own buttons. The home key is essentially a stylish rectangle, the back button differs from other back buttons out there, as this is a regular arrow to the left, and the overview button is completely unique, it looks quite interesting, as it’s made out of two horizontal letters ‘L’ which are meeting each other in order to form a button. Thanks to this leak, we also get to check out a part of the Galaxy S8’s UI, its app drawer, to be more precise. Interestingly enough, we don’t get to see the home / power key here, nor the phone’s volume rocker, which could indicate that the image has been tampered with. If this is not the final design of the Galaxy S8, then it’s at least very close to it, at least as far as its hardware design is concerned. \nThe Galaxy S8 will probably arrive on March 29th along with its sibling, the Galaxy S8 Plus. Samsung will unveil the launch date of these two smartphones during MWC 2017, we can only guess when will they launch until that happens. The two devices will look basically identical, though the Galaxy S8 Plus will be a considerably larger smartphone. The Galaxy S8 is rumored to ship with a 5.8-inch display, while the Galaxy S8 Plus will sport a 6.2-inch panel. Both devices will be fueled by the Snapdragon 835 SoC by Qualcomm, though it is possible that Samsung opts to release an Exynos variant of both of these devices as well. In any case, stay tuned, chances are we’ll see quite a few more leaks before Samsung introduces the Galaxy S8.
