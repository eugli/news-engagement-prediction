A similar protest last year led to the deaths of four demonstrators, halting work on the plant. \nSuch protests risk delaying the project and hamper fund-raising efforts, said a senior official of conglomerate S Alam Group, which has a deal with China’s SEPCOIII Electric Power Construction Corp to build the 1,320-MW plant. \n“We hope to resolve the problem soon, otherwise we may not be able to finish our project in time,” said the official, who declined to be identified because he is not authorised to speak to the media. \nChinese banks are expected to provide 70% of the projected investment, he added. \nThe plant will use the “most sophisticated technology” to reduce its environmental impact, said Masud Alam, chairman of the Bangladesh conglomerate, who offered to help with medical treatment for the injured. \nLate last year, China signed 27 pacts worth billions of dollars with the south Asian nation, as it steps up a competition with India to build regional influence. It is also seeking to boost investment in another of India’s neighbours, Sri Lanka. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:37:25.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
