Hoeven said he also spoke with U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence.\nAn army spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday night. Hoeven's spokesman Don Canton says that Speer's move means the easement \"isn't quite issued yet, but they plan to approve it\" within days.\n​Final big chunk The crossing under Lake Oahe, a wide section of the Missouri River in southern North Dakota, is the final big chunk of work on the four-state, $3.8 billion US pipeline that will carry North Dakota oil through South Dakota and Iowa to Illinois.\nU.S. President Donald Trump called on the Army Corps of Engineers last week to reconsider its December decision to withhold permission until more study is done on the crossing.\nTrump gives OK to Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines Standing Rock protesters undeterred by Trump's pipeline order The move is likely to be challenged in court by the Standing Rock Sioux, who have spent months protesting the project along with supporters from around the country. The tribe gets drinking water from the river and worries a pipeline leak would pollute the water. The developer, Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, says the pipeline is safe.\nAn environmental assessment conducted last year determined the crossing would not have a significant impact on the environment. However, then-assistant army secretary for civil works, Jo-Ellen Darcy, declined to issue an easement on Dec. 4, saying a broader environmental study was warranted in the wake of opposition by the Standing Rock Sioux.\nCompany poised to drill immediately Energy Transfer Partners called Darcy's decision politically motivated and accused former president Barack Obama's administration of delaying the matter until he left office. Two days before he left the White House, the Corps launched a study of the crossing that could take up to two years to complete.\nStanding Rock protesters celebrate 'big victory' as pipeline construction halted Trump signed an executive action, telling the Corps to quickly reconsider the Dec. 4 decision, just four days after he took office.\nEnergy Transfer Partners appears poised to begin drilling under the lake immediately. \nWorkers have already drilled entry and exit holes for the Oahe crossing, and the company has put oil in the pipeline leading up to the lake in anticipation of finishing the project, its executive vice-president Joey Mahmoud said in court documents filed earlier this month.\nHundreds, and at times thousands, of pipeline opponents who have dubbed themselves \"water protectors\" have camped on federal land near the crossing site since last August, often clashing with police and prompting more than 625 arrests.\nThe camp's population has thinned to fewer than 300 due to harsh winter weather and a plea by Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault for the camp to disband before the spring flooding season.\nStanding Rock leader tells protest camp it's time to go home 'Enough now': Standing Rock tribe formally asks protesters to leave camps © The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T05:19:18.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
