The policy was part of the government's commitment to tackling obesity, she said. \nAn evaluation of products sold in school canteens and hospitals last year found there was a mismatch between what was allowed to be sold in those institutions with the recommendations of the Australian Dietary Guidelines and the health star rating system. \nPublic Health Association of Australia chief executive Michael Moore said it was appropriate for dairy products that did not meet a minimum health standard not to be sold in hospitals. \n\"You only have to look at sugary yoghurt, flavoured milk and very salty cheese to see that some of these [products] are less healthy than others,\" Mr Moore said. \n\"Generally the Public Health Association thinks that the proposal from NSW Health is very good. They've taken a very sensible step in ensuring the health facilities are providing as healthy as possible food without taking away choice and that has to be extremely positive.\" Everyday food muesli with no added sugar canned or fresh fruit", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:42:52.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
