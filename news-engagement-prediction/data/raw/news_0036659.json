Hingle, USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW ORLEANS – Jimmy Butler speaks his mind and sometimes, he admits, it causes him trouble. But he’s open and honest when asked questions, which is refreshing in the world of playerspeak that often devolves into tired clichés and little substance. \nBut Butler isn’t too open about his view on the chatter that he could be traded from Chicago. Well, that’s not entirely true. He shared an opinion when asked Friday during media day for the NBA All Star Game. It just seemed a little, subdued. \n“I don’t know if I deserve to be traded. That’s not in my job description,” he said. “I’m just here to play basketball to the best of my ability. If I’m here, I’m here.” \nThe fact that Butler’s name is mentioned in trade talks seems strange. He’s the best player on this year’s Bulls team and is having his best season as a pro. \nMORE NBA: NBAPA's Chris Paul, Michele Roberts lament Charles Oakley-Knicks incident \nHe’s putting up 24.5 points, five assists and 6.3 rebounds for a team that, with a 28-29 record, is viewed as underachieving. He’s in the third year of a five-year $95 million contract and it would seem like the team should be building around him instead of thinking about moving him. \n“Nothing I can do about it,” he said when asked about if there’s talk about trade rumors. “Control what you can control. Why talk about it? Why worry about it? If you’re here, you’re here. If you’re not, you’re not.” \nFair enough. But what if he did get moved? Where could he go? While there should be several teams lined up for Butler’s services, one that might be at the top of the list is the Boston Celtics, who are second in the East, but who could be facing some serious competition in their quest to unseat the Cleveland Cavaliers at the top.
