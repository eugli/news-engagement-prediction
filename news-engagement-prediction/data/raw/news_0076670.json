It will give courage to every volunteer who wakes up every morning to run towards bombs. \n\"If I cannot enter the US, I will not give up: we know that we have many friends in US, that there are people that share our humanitarian values. \n\"I look forward to meeting them all one day.\" \nHe is not thought to have been affected by US President Donald Trump's travel ban, that was suspended by the courts days after it was put into effect. \nFind us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:22:37.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
