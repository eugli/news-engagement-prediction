Carpenter, who made a splash on her recent tour in a Coach varsity jacket, dazzling dresses from Marc Jacobs, and sparkly, sky-high boots, believes that fashion is all about evoking a mood. “I’m kind of able to be a different person every day,” she said. \"Being onstage, you’re always bolder than who you are offstage. I try not to be too different. I’m still a loud personality. I just wear what my heart tells me to.” Carpenter’s show schedule showed the range of her own budding fashion taste: Baja East, Coach, and Marc Jacobs. “Each of the designers I was going to, I didn’t know what I was in store for,” she said. At Coach, Carpenter fell for creative director Stuart Vevers’s micro-lady bags. “There was a cute pink one [and] it makes you feel like you’re holding a little love,” mused Carpenter. What would she put in her own Coach bag? “My hopes and dreams!” she joked, before listing the bag’s more likely contents: chocolate chip cookies, her phone, and her hotel room key. The biggest fashion moment of Carpenter’s week came at Baja East. “[It] made me feel like the coolest of cool. My fans were tweeting me, ‘How did you look so cool tonight?’ Is this supposed to be a compliment or an insult?” laughed the singer, who participated directly in that show . Carpenter closed her week by attending the Marc Jacobs show, where she was inspired by the designer’s ability to adapt and maintain his relevance. “You’re constantly seeing the growth within other people and it makes you want to grow yourself,” said Carpenter. “It makes you expect the unexpected and create the uncreated.” At Marc Jacobs, she wore a Lurex heart-print top with demi-leg-of-mutton sleeves and pin-thin aubergine jeans with whimsical embroidery. “It’s nice to have hearts in an outfit—you don’t see it a lot where it’s not cheesy,” she said. Next up for the crooner is a stadium tour kicking off in London where, naturally, Carpenter is eyeing the fashion scene. On her hit list? “Christopher Kane,” said the singer. “I love how bold he is.” While abroad, Carpenter will be celebrating her 18th birthday—a milestone she plans to toast once she arrives in Paris. “I’d love to visit a café where there’s music playing and just have a croissant,” she said, before thinking better of it. “Scratch the croissant. I want a whole baguette.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T03:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T00:49:53.736+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
