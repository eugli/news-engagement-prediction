I tried one last year and it was horrific.” \nIn a press conference held today in east London, Murray added – more seriously - that he might consider taking longer breaks from the game after his early exit from the Australian Open. Murray suffered an early exit at the Australian Open \nT he year’s first grand slam turned into a disappointment for Murray, whose fourth-round conqueror – world No 50 Mischa Zverev – was the lowest-ranked opponent he has lost to at a major since he was 18. There was a theory in the locker-room that the exertions of 2016, which found Murray winning the last five events he contested, had caught up with him.

It was the same for Rafa. Maybe that is something we can all learn from. \n“He’s just extremely popular,” added Murray of Federer, whose appearance at Andy Murray Live will take him to Scotland for the first time. \n“He’s obviously one of the best players who’s ever played the game. It’s not just how much he won but also the way that he plays and the way that he carries himself. He’s just really popular everywhere.

This year is going to be even bigger and better and I am so pleased to be able to bring Roger to play in Scotland for the first time – and he will get a chance to see for himself how enthusiastic Scottish fans are. We are very lucky. This year to have Roger involved is incredible.” \nFurther details from www.andymurraylive.com Follow the latest Telegraph Tennis news READ MORE ABOUT: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T16:14:42.255+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
