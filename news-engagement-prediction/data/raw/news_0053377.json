After James Robart, a federal judge from Washington, blocked the immigration order, Trump went on a Twitter rant in which he called Robart a “so-called judge.” Twitter Then, when a federal appeals court refused to reinstate the ban , the president once again vented his frustrations on Twitter. Twitter \nGiven all this, and Trump’s apparent lack of respect for checks and balances or the notion the president does not have absolute power, people are trolling Ivanka pretty hard about her visit to the Supreme Court. A lot of people think Ivanka should’ve taken her father to the Supreme Court, instead of Arabella, in order to “teach” him about the judicial system.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T23:44:28.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
