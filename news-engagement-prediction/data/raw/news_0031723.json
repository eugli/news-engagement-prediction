There have been doubts about the deal for months as a result of Yahoo revealing not one, but two massive security breaches affecting more than one billion users. \nBrian Wieser, an analyst who covers Yahoo for Pivotal Research Group, had assumed Verizon would seek a $1 billion price cut as a result of the breaches -- if the deal went through at all. \n\"The worst case scenario is they outright canceled it,\" Wieser told CNNTech. \"It's better for Verizon and Yahoo to put the standalone [Yahoo] business out of its misery and roll it into Verizon as soon as possible.\" \nRelated: Why Marissa Mayer couldn't save Yahoo \nYahoo warned investors in November there was \"no assurance\" Verizon would actually go through with the deal. Last month, Yahoo told investors it expected the closing date to be delayed . \nVerizon agreed to buy Yahoo's core Internet business in July. Verizon's goal was to use Yahoo's billion users to build an online advertising powerhouse to rival Google ( GOOGL   . \nThen the security breaches were disclosed, prompting concerns about lawsuits and lost users. Just this week, the U.S. Senate began probing Yahoo on the hack. \n\"I've got an obligation to make sure we protect our shareholders and our investors,\" Marni Walden, Verizon's head of product, said at an event in October. \"We need to have more information before we can determine [what happens to the deal].\" \nSome of Verizon's competitors have taken jabs at it over the Yahoo drama. \n\"Verizon, everybody knows, Yahoo is driving them nuts,\" T-Mobile CEO John Legere said on an earnings call this week. \"They're damned if they do it, they're damned if they don't.\" \nApparently Verizon has decided to be damned for doing it.  25 PM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T00:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T19:50:05.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
