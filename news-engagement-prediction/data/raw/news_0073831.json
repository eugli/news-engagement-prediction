Save Lucy Nicholson / Reuters \nAmazon's $10 million bet on Manchester by the Sea has paid off with a few Oscar wins. Casey Affleck won the Academy Award for Best Actor, while writer/director Kenneth Lonergan picked up Best Adapted Screenplay. The film was nominated for seven Oscars , and it notably made Amazon the first streaming video company to earn a Best Picture nod. It was also Amazon's first Golden Globe winning film, so all in all that $10 million seems pretty well-spent. \nAmazon also beat out Netflix, which scored one Oscar win for the short documentary The White Helmets . Netflix was also nominated for Ava DuVernay's The 13th in the documentary category, but it lost out to the epic-length O.J.: Made in America.
