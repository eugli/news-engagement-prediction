(ER24) Mom who allegedly stabbed baby to be observed at Valkenberg \nEmalahleni - She lay quietly in nothing more than a thin, red baby grow in a field on a frosty and rainy morning in Emalahleni, Mpumalanga. \nThe day-old baby made no sound when a security guard, who was patrolling the area on Monday morning, picked her up and held her in his arms. \nThe baby was found lying in a field close to the main entrance of the Puma Stadium, suffering from hypothermia. \nER24 spokesperson Annine Dormehl said it is believed that the little girl was left in the rain for two to three hours. \n\"If she had been in the rain any longer, she would have definitely either not survived or there would have been other health complications. She wasnâ€™t really crying throughout the whole process, or traumised,\" Dormehl said. \nThe baby girl was soaking wet. She was changed into dry clothes to regulate her temperature. \nDormehl said paramedics had taken her to the Emalahleni Private Hospital within five minutes of finding her. \n\"It is believed that the baby was born in a hospital, because her umbilical cord was cut and there was no form of identification left with her,\" she said. \nShe was taken to a private hospital and stablised. \nAfter she was stablised, the baby was taken to a public hospital where social services became involved, Dormehl said. \nThe baby was being looked after and the police were notified.
