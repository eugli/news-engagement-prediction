The first occurred on Feb. 6 when police alleged he approached a woman near her car on Ste. Catherine St. East. He allegedly pulled out a gun and demanded the woman’s car keys and cell phone. When she refused, he shot her in the chest.\nThe woman remains in hospital.\nThe second attack happened the next day, when police said the man entered a convenience store at Place Frontenac. Police said he brandished a handgun and asked the clerk to him the money in a cash. While the clerk gave him the money, he shot her nonetheless. She suffered minor injuries.\nHe is described as between 50 and 65-years-old with grey hair and glasses and he walks with a limp. Police said he appears to be an isolated person with impulse control issues.\n“This man uses the metro as a transport method,” said SPVM spokesperson Daniel Lacoursiere. “So we’re asking people to be very vigilant, if they see him, contact 911 and police will proceed to his arrest.”\nAnyone with information is asked to come to the command post or call 911.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T21:24:37.029+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
