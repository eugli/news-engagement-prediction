The Florida Atlantic University Business and Economics Polling Initiative, which conducted the poll, said it had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent. Sanctuary communities \nOne of many hot issues that have emerged since Trump became president is sanctuary communities. On Jan. 25, he signed an executive order threatening to cut off federal funding to communities that provide sanctuary to immigrants who aren’t legally in the country. \nA majority of Floridians – 52 percent to 36 percent – do not want the federal government to cut off funding to sanctuary cities. The poll used the common term “sanctuary cities.” \nAnd a related question found 46 percent of respondents don’t want the U.S. Department of Justice to take action against sanctuary cities – but 38 percent support Justice Department action. \nMonica Escaleras, director of the FAU Business and Economics Polling Initiative, said in a written analysis of the results that “this means that Floridians support sanctuary policies that commit a city to serving all individuals without regard to immigration status.” \nThe results don’t show broad public approval of sanctuary cities, which the pollsters defined as offering “safe harbor for undocumented immigrants who might otherwise be deported by federal immigration law enforcement officials.” \nMany people aren’t familiar with the topic. When asked an initial question – whether they were familiar with the term sanctuary city – 55 percent said they were and 45 percent said they weren’t familiar with the term or weren’t sure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T05:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:25:12.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
