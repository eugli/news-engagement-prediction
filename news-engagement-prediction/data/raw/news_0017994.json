(Photo: NBAE/Getty Images) \nThe Inside the NBA crew weighed in on what happened Wednesday night at the Knicks game when Charles Oakley was arrested at Madison Square Garden . \nA little background on the incident: The Knicks said that Oakley was arrested because he \"behaved in a highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner,\" and they even added that they \"hope he gets some help soon.\" \nOn the other hand, Oakley said , \"I walked in the Garden. Simple. I was there four minutes, I sit down, I'm talking to people, people talking back to me. … Then about eight to 10 guys come up (and say), 'We have orders you have to leave.' … That's when everything started.\" \nDwyane Wade and LeBron James have sided with Oakley over the Knicks. \nHere's what the TNT crew said: \nCharles Barkley said that the entire thing was simply bad for basketball as a product. He called it \"a black eye for the entire sport,\" and said that \"we're supposed to put a good product out there, and that was just a bad night for the NBA.\" Charles Barkley on last night's incident with Charles Oakley at MSG. pic.twitter.com/qta2fzUWus — NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 10, 2017 \nBarkley said: \n\"I thought that it made the Knicks look bad, it made Charles Oakley look bad and it made the NBA look bad. Plain and simple. There was no winners. We all are losers. Our job, we get paid to promote the NBA, the Knicks are an awful basketball team, they have been disrespectful to Carmelo Anthony, but this was a black eye for the entire sport. Plain and simple. Like I said, everybody looked bad. It makes us look bad because we're supposed to put a good product out there, and that was just a bad night for the NBA. Plain and simple.\" The NBA on TNT crew weighs in on last night's Charles Oakley incident at MSG. pic.twitter.com/x85vGijAUI — NBA on TNT (@NBAonTNT) February 10, 2017 \nShaq said he \"didn't like how the situation unfolded\" because Oakley is a legend who was \"the heart and soul of that franchise.\" But what Shaq really took issue with was the way the Knicks responded to the situation. \n\"For me, personally, I don't like the statement when they said he was a great Knick, maybe he should get some help soon, because that implies intoxication, other abuse, mental abuse, stuff like this,\" Shaq said. \nKenny Smith added that he believes the Knicks should've only sent one person over to talk to Oakley, rather than a team of people. Smith said he didn't like how security seemed to escalate things rather than diffuse them, like they're supposed to do.
