(AP) — Grey Gardens, the Hamptons home once owned by eccentric relatives of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, is for sale. It was featured in a documentary, HBO movie and Broadway musical. \nNewsday reports it has been listed for $19.95 million. \nIn a 1975 documentary, it was the rundown home of Onassis’ aunt Edith Bouvier Beale and her cousin, Edith Beale. HBO made a 2009 Emmy-award winning movie about their story. Later it was the subject of a Broadway musical. \nLongtime Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee and his journalist wife, Sally Quinn, bought the home in 1977. \nBradlee died in 2014. Quinn reportedly told a real estate agent the home didn’t feel the same without him. \nThe three-story, shingle-style home was built in 1897. It features seven bedrooms and 6 1/2 bathrooms. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T04:50:20.947+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
