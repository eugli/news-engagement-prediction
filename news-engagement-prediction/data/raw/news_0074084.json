agency Frontex has said.\nSpeaking to Germany’s Die Welt newspaper, Fabrice Leggeri called for rescue operations to be re-evaluated and accused NGOs of ineffectively cooperating with security agencies against human traffickers.\nReopening a row with charities and leftwing groups, Leggeri said 40% of recent rescue operations at sea off the north African country were carried out by non-government organisations, making it impossible to check the origins of the migrants or their smuggling routes if the NGOs did not cooperate.\nLuise Amstberg, refugee spokeswoman for the Greens in the German parliament, denounced Leggeri’s comments. “The number of dead would be much higher without the tireless commitment of non-governmental organisations so we are indebted to these organisations,” she said.\nA spokesman for Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said there was no evidence of a lack of cooperation.\nBodies of dozens of people wash ashore in western Libya Read more \nIn his interview, Leggeri said that under maritime law everyone at sea had a duty to rescue vessels and people in distress. “But we must avoid supporting the business of criminal networks and traffickers in Libya through European vessels picking up migrants ever closer to the Libyan coast.\n“This leads traffickers to force even more migrants on to unseaworthy boats with insufficient water and fuel than in previous years.”\nHe also claimed some NGOs cooperate poorly with EU security agencies, which “makes it more difficult ... to gain information on trafficking networks through interviews with migrants and to open police investigations”.\nMSF labelled the charges “extremely serious and damaging” and said its humanitarian action was not “the cause but a response” to the crisis.\nFrontex said in January that arrivals to Europe by sea last year had fallen by almost two-thirds to 364,000 compared with 2015, mainly due to an EU border deal with Turkey that sharply reduced landings in Greece. \nBut the agency said Italy was the exception , with a record 181,000 arrivals, mostly from Africa via the Mediterranean – a 20% rise from 2015. Leggeri predicted that because of the Libya-Italy route “one should expect that more [people] will come in 2017 than in 2016”. \nAlso speaking to Die Welt, the new president of the European parliament, Antonio Tajani , proposed the EU should set up reception centres for asylum seekers in Libya, taking over the role currently played by smugglers and the state. \nTajani warned that unless Europe acts now 20 million African people will come to Europe over the next few years.\nThe proposed Libyan detention centres should not become “concentration camps” but should have adequate equipment to ensure refugees live in dignified conditions with access to sufficient medical care, Tajani added.\nConditions in more than 30 existing detention centres, both those run illegally by smugglers and by militias nominally on behalf of the Libyan ministry of justice, violate human rights conditions, the EU has said.\n\nA leaked report from the EU external action service describes Libyan border management as “in a state of complete disarray and unable to combat smuggling”, adding smuggling is “a low risk, high value” source of income for organised crime.\nEchoing the report, Leggeri added: “There is no stable state. At present, we have virtually no contact at the operational level in order to promote effective border protection. We are now helping to train 60 officers of a possibly future Libyan coastguard. But this is at most a beginning.”\nHe said work to train a Libyan coastguard to operate inside Libyan waters had only just begun. Overseas vessels are forbidden from operating in Libyan waters, and cannot send back refugees rescued in international waters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T16:40:53.206+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
