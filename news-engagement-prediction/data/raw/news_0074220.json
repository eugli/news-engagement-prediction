Besides, they have pitched for criminal action against wilful defaulters. \nUFBU, who claims membership of nearly 10 lakh across banks, also requested the government for cost reimbursement of demonetisation to banks. \nAs many as 27 public sector banks control 75 percent of the total business. \nWith PTI Inputs ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T13:19:25.352+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
