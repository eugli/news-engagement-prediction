Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com TownNews.com Content Exchange \nJUPITER, Fla. • It would have been easy for Dexter Fowler to lash out at the hate spewed his way this weekend after he described President Trump’s proposed travel ban as unfortunate. \nFowler didn’t lash out. He didn’t back down, either. He quite simply explained how an important current event affects his wife’s Iranian family. Nothing more, nothing less. \nThis issue isn’t about politics for him. It’s about family. If you can’t see the difference, you’re the one with the problem. \n“The question was asked out of empathy toward my family,” Fowler said Monday. “I appreciate that. If anybody is asking about my family, then I’m going to let them know. Obviously it affected my family. My wife’s Iranian.” \nIf you’re among the people angrily telling Fowler to stick to sports, it’s time for you to realize that your beloved Cardinals are humans. \nI’m embarrassed to have written such an obvious statement, but some folks clearly need to be reminded that each one of the men in Cardinals camp is affected by real-life issues. They belong to their families, not the fans. \nIf the racists and knuckleheads hoped to silence Fowler with their ugly opinions, they were as wrong as their warped views. He loves his Iranian wife, Aliya, and he won’t apologize for acknowledging how his family is affected by Trump’s proposed travel ban of seven Muslim-majority countries. \n“I can’t go over there,” Fowler said of his wife’s native country. “My daughter is half Iranian and half black. She wouldn’t be able to see her cousins or whatever. They’re still over there.” \nThat is not a political statement, folks. That is a statement of fact. \nFowler has been active on social media so long, though, that he wasn’t surprised by some of the responses after he shared his thoughts on the proposed travel ban with ESPN’s Mark Saxon. \n“It’s huge,” Fowler told Saxon on Saturday. “Especially any time you’re not able to see family, it’s unfortunate.” \nCan anybody really have an issue with that statement? \nThe Cardinals’ new center fielder should actually be praised for giving a candid answer at a time when this country needs more understanding. \nSadly, the reactions to his comments were as predictable as they were embarrassing. Fowler’s comments elicited an array of responses. Many of the nastiest comments were posted on the “St. Louis Cardinals True Fans” Facebook page. \n“Dexter can kiss my rear! He can go back where he came from and not be missed,” Jim Dodge wrote on that thread. “He’s clearly an idiot that doesn’t deal in fact. No support for him from this Cardinals household!” \nDodge doesn’t do much research because he surely doesn’t realize Fowler is no idiot. Fowler is actually one of the brightest men in the game. \nFor the record, Fowler was recruited to play basketball at a little known school in Cambridge, Mass. It’s not much of a basketball power, but I hear Harvard is a decent academic institution. \nFowler understands the benefits of social media. More than 285,000 fans follow his Instagram page, @dexterfowler. His @DexterFowler Twitter account has 188,000 followers. \n“I’m a smart individual,” he said. “If you’re smart on it, you can correct things that have happened like what happened. It helps. It can help and it can obviously damage some people as well.” \nCardinals manager Mike Matheny is confident that Fowler has what it takes to cope with the pros and cons of an active social media presence. \n“I think we have the right guy,” Matheny said. \nUnfortunately, some fans don’t know the difference between sharing an opinion and protesting. \n“Just play ball and do your best on and off the field,” Linda Bausch wrote on the Facebook post that featured Fowler’s comments on the travel ban. “We don’t want political protesting from our Cardinals, regardless of our personal politics. You won’t be a good fit or be here long in St Louis.” \nI wish Bausch had been at batting practice Monday at Roger Dean Stadium when Cardinals owner Bill DeWitt Jr. walked over to Fowler and asked if Fowler could meet his friend’s grandson. \nAs DeWitt and general manager John Mozeliak looked on, Fowler flashed his trademark smile and chatted with the boy for a few minutes as DeWitt’s friend shot pictures on his cell phone. \nThen Fowler spent nearly 15 minutes signing autographs for every fan who approached him as he walked back to the clubhouse. \nDeWitt signed Fowler to a five-year, $82.5 million contract in December, so he’ll be in St. Louis for a while. Regardless, it’s important to recognize that Fowler has the right to share his opinion. \nFowler is much more than an All-Star center fielder. He is a husband and a father. He cares about his wife and worries about his family, just like you do. His contract belongs to the Cardinals, but he doesn’t. \nFowler’s story is not complete without Aliya, who emigrated from Iran with her parents when she was five. She’s a U.S. citizen, but her grandparents and extended family remain in Iran. \nHe doesn’t owe anybody an apology for wanting his family to feel safe and free to travel. \n“I’m always going to care for my family,” he said. “If a question is asked out of concern, I’m going to answer the question. I’m going to answer it truthfully. It’s not hurting anybody.” MORE JESUS ORTIZ COLUMNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:23:09.607+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
