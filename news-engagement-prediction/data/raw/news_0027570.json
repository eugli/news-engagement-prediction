The new preference deal for the coming election, which departs from that practice, is undermining the already testy alliance between the Liberals and the Nationals in WA.\nOne Nation support in Queensland leaps from 16% to 23%, poll shows Read more \nGiven John Howard also took the position in 2001 of putting One Nation last, federal Liberals, including the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull , have been attempting to avoid answering questions in recent weeks about whether or not preferencing One Nation was the right thing to do.\nInternally, some in the Coalition believe striking preference deals with One Nation will help establish a protest party in the political mainstream, weakening the position of the Liberal party in a structural sense at a time when voter disaffection is rife, and published polling indicates there is a demonstrable drift away from the major parties.\nThe Liberals and Nationals are spooked by the One Nation surge in regional areas. A new Galaxy poll published over the weekend suggests Hanson’s popularity could help the party pick up more than 20 seats and hold the balance of power in the 93-seat Queensland parliament.\nSupport for One Nation has jumped from 16% to 23% in three months, while the popularity of the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and the LNP, is declining.\nOn Sunday, Sinodinos declared that the One Nation of today was a “very different beast to what it was 20 years ago”.\nIt was put to him that One Nation’s policies had not actually evolved in 20 years, but Sinodinos said “they are a lot more sophisticated, they have clearly resonated with a lot of people”.\nMajor headache for Malcolm Turnbull as minor parties rise | Katharine Murphy Read more \nHe said the government’s job was to treat One Nation the same as any other party represented in the parliament, but “that doesn’t mean we have to agree with their policies”.\n“When it comes to preferencing, we have to make decisions – in this case, a state decision, not a federal decision – based on the local circumstances.\n“My job, Malcolm Turnbull’s job, is to take votes away from One Nation, away from Labor, away from the Greens and maximise the LNP vote.\n“I’m not particularly focused on preferences at the moment. I’m focused more on the policies that help us to get voters back.”\nA Newspoll published last week captured support for independents and small parties at 19% (up from 15%), and One Nation at 8%, which is back to where it was in 1998. The government’s primary vote has dropped four points over the summer.\nSinodinos said Australian voters were currently “mad as hell” and it was going to take some time for the government’s policies to “seep through to them and convince them that the way of One Nation is not the way to go”.\nThe industry minister noted that the architect of One Nation’s 2% tax policy during Hanson’s first stint in federal parliament “has just gone bankrupt”.\n“If this is economic policy these characters are going to be running, I think it is going to be very important for us to make sure the public understand the implications of One Nation’s policies where they exist,” he said.\nHis comments about head-to-head competition with One Nation for hearts and minds are more explicit than others in the government.\nJoyce tells WA Liberals a One Nation preference deal risks feud with Nationals Read more \nTurnbull has regularly attacked protectionism and “political opportunists” who want to turn Australia inward, but he has characterised his critique in general terms.\nWithout naming One Nation, Turnbull told the National Press Club at the beginning of February there were some in politics “doing nothing more than playing on the fears and hardships of those in our community who feel they have not shared in the benefits of globalisation and technological change”.\nThe government has come back after the Christmas break with several policies designed to grab the attention of voters flirting with One Nation.\nIt has also been talking up the prospects of “clean” coal technology, a popular message in regional Queensland.\nAfter a summer of expenses scandals, which tend to enrage alienated voters, the government has moved this past week to remove the gold pass travel entitlement. It has also dumped plans to compulsorily acquire prime farmland in Queensland, which was to be used for joint training exercises with Singapore’s military.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:30:49.691+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
