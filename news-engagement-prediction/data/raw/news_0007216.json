By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Wednesday, February 1, 2017 - 08:51 0 Follow @ZeeNewsSports \nNew Delhi: While the 2017 Australian Open final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal was one of the most anticipated sports matches in India, it seems that wasn't quite the case with Pakistan. \nFormer Pakistani cricket, Ramiz Raja branded his nation as sports unfriendly as none of their channels telecast the epic finale between two legends of Tennis. Unbelievable: We are such a sports unfriendly nation that no channel showed the iconic Federer Nadal Australian Open final..shameful .. \n— Ramiz Raja (@iramizraja) January 29, 2017 \nRamiz Raja's tweet soon became a subject of trolls for twitterati and some hilarious tweets were unleashed. @iramizraja So true Ramiz bhai. That is when we'v channels who r always bragging about the broadcasting rights. Ind-Eng series also missed. \n— Mazher Arshad (@MazherArshad) January 29, 2017 Don't make excuses.
