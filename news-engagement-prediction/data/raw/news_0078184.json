In 1906, the town of Grandview was incorporated.\nAn Exponent article published that year boasted of the town's bustling businesses, including three hotels, two furniture stores, a baker and jeweler. There was also a tobacconist, three stationery stores, two drug stores, five grain elevators, a restaurant, churches and a bank.\nDuring the Great Depression subscriptions to the newspaper sold for $1 per year and many subscribers had to exchange chickens, eggs or produce to make a purchase, said Chaloner.\nThe Exponent survived two fires, one in 1963 and a particularly bad one in 1938 that destroyed four buildings downtown including the town's post office and the newspaper building. But within new weeks the paper was back in business, Chaloner wrote.\n\"Our readers will be interested to know that in getting the paper to the subscribers and the replacing of office equipment, the publishers travelled over three thousand miles by motor and rail, worked from twelve to eighteen hours every day, and some weeks used as many as four offices to complete the issue,\" wrote the editor at that time, as Quote: d by Chaloner.\nWaddell believes papers in nearby Roblin and Dauphin will help to cover current events in Grandview, although nothing can quite replace the Exponent.\n\"Communities of Manitoba and certainly anywhere else in North America for that matter are gradually beginning to realize that they're never going to read the kind of news in their local paper anywhere else,\" he said.\n\"The local newspaper has to be the one that provides you with the local news and that's the strength and that will be the salvation.\"\nIn 2016 Statistics Canada reported the population of Grandview, located about 290 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg, was 1,482, down 1.7 per cent from the last census in 2011.\nContest crowns 'Head Cheese' in Grandview, Man.
