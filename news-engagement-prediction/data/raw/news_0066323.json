His album, “Tears in the Club,” is filled with dark tracks topped by vocals from Syd and SZA. Credit Lane Stewart KINGDOM (BORN EZRA RUBIN) AGE 34 ORIGINS Raised in rural southern Massachusetts, the D.J. and producer Kingdom got his start in music “kind of by accident” while studying fine art at Parsons School of Design. After scoring the first few seasons of shows for the cult fashion disrupters Hood by Air , Mr. Rubin moved to Los Angeles and co-founded the record label Fade to Mind (Fatima Al Qadiri, Kelela, Nguzunguzu). “We’ve always joked around about it being sad, sexy, scary,” Mr. Rubin said of his label and creative collective, which blends a diverse palette of underground club music (footwork, UK bass, Baltimore club) with modern rap and R&B influences. “There’s a little bit of hedonistic sexuality, a little bit of the melancholy and this shred of violence and disorder and dystopia.” WHAT NOW? “Tears in the Club,” Mr. Rubin’s debut LP as Kingdom, takes his cavernous, multilayered tracks closer than ever to pop song structures, featuring vocals from the R&B individualists Syd and SZA. “I really just wanted to delve more into melody,” Mr. Rubin said. “I’m not formally trained, and a lot of my music doesn’t have that melodic core to it that someone can sing over. When I started to make a few more beats where that seemed to be possible, it just gave me this amazing feeling.” Mr. Rubin discussed “Tears in the Club” in a recent telephone interview from Los Angeles. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Why are you drawn to female vocalists? I’ve just always been a fan. That’s the contrast I like — bringing something really, really heavy in the instrumental, and then there’s this somewhat lighter layer of the feminine over it. Maybe it’s partially my own feminine side that is either conflicted or shamed or hidden, and it’s a way for me express and explore that. What were you listening to in your formative years that put you down that path? Janet and Mariah, for sure. I had a really heavy This Mortal Coil and Cocteau Twins phase, so there was this more ephemeral, dreamy side, too. Brandy , of course, for enjoyment but also for the technical [aspect], hearing the way they were layering her voice, using it as an instrument over really futuristic production. There’s always been male vocalists sprinkled in, too; I’m just attracted to male vocalists who can really show their vulnerability or desperation. It gets on my nerves to listen to a male vocalist who’s all bragging.
