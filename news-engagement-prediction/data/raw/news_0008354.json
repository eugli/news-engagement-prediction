In a segment captured on Twitter, Wilson touches on the controversial Trump presidency, making particular mention of the executive order curbing immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries.\nWilson also takes time to praise former President Barack Obama, who hosted Wilson and now-wife Ciara Harris during a state dinner in 2015 and whom Wilson said he supported in October.\nHere's the entirety of Wilson's comments on the subject:\n\"Everybody has the right to choose who they want to vote for, but this thing's getting out of hand. It's getting out of hand, people. Just so you know, I voted for Hillary. When you think about, it's only been what, two weeks? Or even less? We've got to attack this issue here. Basically I think when you think about all the negativity that's happened within a 10-day period or however many days it's been, it's already too much. It's already crazy. It's already affecting people's hearts and souls and lives in such a negative way, in my opinion.\n\"We go to the LAX airport, and there's people all over the place fighting for their lives and protesting and all that. All the protests that have gone on through the African-American community, through obviously the Muslim community too -- if we're going to be a nation that says we're equal, we have to be equal -- obviously being smart, all that kind of stuff.\n\"But you also have to be able to treat people fairly. You have to love everyone. And I know from even my own faith, the Christian faith, we still have to love everybody. We still have to. No matter what our issues are, we still have to find ways to love people and care for people. And so I think that's the thing that's been crazy already.\n\"I don't even know if he's going to be able to last four years, in my opinion. You don't want to wish bad upon anybody, because if he doesn't last four years, that means that something went wrong. So hopefully nothing goes wrong -- any more than what it's already doing. But it's just been a crazy 10 days already.\n\"Come back, Barack! I think despite a lot of people's political issues or views or whatever, people really realize how much President Obama was able to deal with situations. You can't run a nation and have everything be perfect, but I think people have a great appreciation of his class. The class that he was able to deliver to most people and to care for people. Same thing with first lady Michelle Obama.\n\"Now you kind of recognize that people's feelings are getting hurt, people's lives (are) getting changed, people are getting sent back or not let in back home to see their families for reasons that may not be worthy, you know. Just because you believe in something or you're from a certain place doesn't mean that you're a bad person.\"\nRussell Wilson on Trump pic.twitter.com/VqXzlEovwX\n— Sam HawkBadger (@hwkbgr) January 31, 2017 Part 2 pic.twitter.com/CSx1d5avIl\n— Sam HawkBadger (@hwkbgr) January 31, 2017 Visit seattlepi.com for more Seattle Seahawks news .
