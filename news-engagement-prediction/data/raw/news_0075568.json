In the above episode, we take a look back at the first years of the magazine which was first published in 1892. Start-up wasn’t part of the lexicon in 1892 when started a weekly journal of fashion and society called Vogue , but the concept of getting by with a little help from your friends was familiar to an Ivy-educated club man. IN THE BEGINNING Arthur Baldwin Turnure, a type-mad Princeton grad and a cofounder of the Grolier Club, launched Vogue in 1892 as “a dignified authentic journal of society, fashion, and the ceremonial side of life.” Over time, fashion—for both men and women—was to occupy more and more space in this magazine created by and for the leisure class. Vogue was, noted one editor, “the dernier cri of the week, thanks to the people who published it, who happened to know better than anyone else what was going to be accepted by the people who mattered.” These were defined as “gentlemen and gentlewomen” and, said Turnure, “it was to the requirements of this class [the magazine’s] energies and resources shall conform.” Besides its snob appeal, Vogue’s niche appeal was the draw for crackerjack publisher Condé Nast, who purchased it in 1909. Nast is credited with developing the then revolutionary concept of class, or special interest publication, which valued engagement over circulation, and which is taken for granted today. LUMPS, BUMPS, AND HUMPS According to Edna Woolman Chase, a nearly-60-year veteran of Vogue , the magazine’s animal-loving first editor, Josephine Redding “violently disapproved” of the fashions of her day. “Humps,” Redding wrote. “Women today are all covered with humps. Big humpy sleeves, humps on their hips, humps on their behinds, it’s nonsense.” To the modern eye, the corseted turn-of-the-century S-curve or pouter pigeon silhouette can seem both torturous and impossible: The top and bottom halves of the body seemed to be entirely independent of each other, save for a tenuous connection at an miniscule middle. Dominant for about a decade, this long, sinuous line was balanced by upswept hair and much embellished picture hats shading makeup-free faces. READY FOR ACTION The gentlewoman might not have struggled with need, but she did contend with expectations, of sex and station as well as the restrictions of dress. Designers dreamed up outfits for seemingly every conceivable activity: There were street and visiting gowns; cloaks for the opera and dishabille for afternoon at home. . . . Her life was constricted, but it was not static; nor was it purely social: sport was an important part of her life. Cover and interior illustrations show her riding sidesaddle, canoeing, skating, bathing, golfing. In fact, she looked most modern in that foolproof combo of shirtwaist and skirt. REINVENTING THE WHEEL The upwardly mobile woman, to whom Vogue catered, was not only sporty, she was addicted to speed. The golden age of the bicycle roughly coincides with the debut of the magazine, and the Vogue girl was an early enthusiast of this newfangled contraption, as she also became of the automobile. THE WELL-DRESSED MAN “That it is not necessary for the man as well as the women to have due regard for appearances, no one seriously contends,” noted Vogue when it turned 10. Though Edna Woolman Chase, who signed on in 1895, would grumble that during Turnure’s tenure “fashion got short shrift besides the men’s interest, such as sports and club news,” the magazine’s interest in men’s dress, addressed in such regular columns like “As Seen by Him” and “The Well-Dressed Man” was touted as a point of distinction. “No other periodical of general circulation” it was claimed, sustained such an interest, one that was evident from the beginning: The cover of the second issue was the first of many to feature a dapper couple; others featured only men.
