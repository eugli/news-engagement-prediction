The party now needs to bring in serious people to fix its ramshackle administration, stay relevant, and stay radical or it will die. \n“From what I hear far from winning elections, Carswell’s main concern is sabotaging Nigel’s knighthood, which is why he must leave the party.” \nBanks, who recently launched the brash rightwing website Westmonster, said he is going to make a formal complaint about Carswell to Ukip’s national executive committee for bringing the party into disrepute. \n“Mr Carswell is a career politician and doesn’t care about Ukip and he has got to get out,” the businessman said. \n“So my first job as chairman would be to purge the party of these sorts of people. Carswell is welcome to go back to the Tories or stand as an independent but he will not be welcome under the Ukip banner. He has always been a green-eyed jealous monster when it comes to Nigel.”\nBanks added: “The vast majority of Ukip people are lovely people but there is an element that causes trouble and if I was in charge I would want to eliminate all of that.” \nUkip had seen Stoke, which voted overwhelmingly for Brexit in last year’s referendum, as fertile ground for a challenge to Labour in a contest triggered by the resignation of former shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt. \nFacebook Twitter Pinterest ‘I’m not going anywhere’: Ukip’s Paul Nuttall reacts after Stoke byelection defeat \nHowever, Nuttall’s gamble of standing himself failed to come off as Labour’s Gareth Snell held the seat with a majority of 2,620, raising questions as to whether Ukip could take seats from Labour in its traditional heartlands. \nIn response, Farage appeared to suggest Ukip should adopt Donald Trump-style immigration policies to “own” the issue in the eyes of the electorate. \nHe said on Friday: “Should we have strong vetting, should we make sure that we’re a place that illegal immigrants can’t come, should we have a proper, balanced system where we take good people in from around the world? Absolutely, that’s exactly what we should be doing and I think maybe Ukip has slightly lost ownership of this argument.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T01:25:55.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
