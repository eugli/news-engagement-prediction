Antoine Griezmann breaks silence over Manchester United transfer speculation \nCity will be disappointed at conceding three away goals at the Etihad Stadium, but look in a strong position to make it through to the quarter-finals after taking the lead in the tie. \nGuardiola was in bullish mood afterwards, perhaps taking a swipe back at his critics by proclaiming that games like this are why the club were so keen to appoint him as manager. Man City hit five goals to stage a thrilling comeback (Picture: Getty) \n‘We attacked in small spaces, we defended huge spaces behind, Guardiola said after the match. \n‘That is why they wanted me to come here – I love to play in that way, I think it is something special when two teams play in that way, attack and attack. In the end the football is marvellous. \n‘It was a special game, I cannot deny that. Ups and downs. We attacked quite good, our build-up was quite slow, but it was not easy because Monaco are so organised.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T17:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T12:38:15.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
