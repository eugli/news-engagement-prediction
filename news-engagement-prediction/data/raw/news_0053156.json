The attack took place around 9 p.m. Friday, according to the police log. \nOn Saturday, a student reported being sexually assaulted at a campus residence hall around 6:45 p.m, according to the U. of I. police crime log and blotter. No other information was available. \nNo arrests have been made. \nAt least three other sexual assaults were reported to campus police this month, attacks that were the subject of broader safety alerts. UIPD spokesman Patrick Wade would not discuss the status of the investigations but said several factors influence the decision to publicly notify the campus community about sexual assaults. \n\"We typically believe that when we identify, interview, make contact with or arrest an offender, this mitigates the ongoing threat to the general public,\" Wade said in an email. \"When a survivor requests that we not contact anyone or not pursue an investigation, we typically make the call that a public safety concern remains. There are a lot of nuances in these incidents that make each one different, but I would say that was the primary difference between the notices from earlier this month and the incidents this weekend.\" University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are investigating reports this week that allege two students were sexually assaulted at fraternities, according to two campus safety alerts.\nCampus police received the most recent report Thursday, which alleged a student was sexually assaulted... \nPolice at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are investigating reports this week that allege two students were sexually assaulted at fraternities, according to two campus safety alerts. \nCampus police received the most recent report Thursday, which alleged a student was sexually assaulted... (Marwa Eltagouri) \nUniversities that receive federal funding are required to publicly report data on crimes that occur on campus, in some noncampus buildings and on public property within and bordering campus boundaries, according to the Clery Act. The law also requires universities to issue timely warnings and emergency alerts if a particular crime represents ongoing or immediate threats to public safety and health of students and employees. \nThe law is named for Jeanne Clery, a Lehigh University student who was raped and murdered in her dorm in 1986. \nWade said the weekend attacks did not meet all the benchmarks to necessitate a larger warning under the Clery Act. \n\"The criteria are largely location-based, but we also evaluate each incident on a case-by-case basis to determine if that incident, in particular, presents an ongoing public safety threat to the general public,\" Wade said. \nIn the other reports of sexual assaults this month, one student was attacked at a fraternity Feb. 4, according to a police alert. Another student reported being attacked Feb. 7 at a fraternity house by someone the student knew. Then on Feb. 12, a student reported being assaulted inside a residence hall. The accused perpetrator also was known to the victim, police said. \nPolice informed the campus community of all three of those attacks in separate safety notices, urging people to be aware of their surroundings and take precautions. \nNorthwestern University in Evanston also received reports this month that at least three students were sexually assaulted and possibly drugged at fraternity houses. \nTwitter @rhodes_dawn", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T02:46:50.743+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
