This is the fulfilment of one of his campaign promises. This is in recognition of the fight, struggle, and injustice done against Ogoni people. \n“What we want to do is to start something that in the next five years, people will attest to government’s effort. In the next 20 years, we will restore Ogoniland to where it was years ago. Community leaders, youths, women, oil companies, civil society groups, everybody, must participate to ensure that we succeed. \n“The clean-up in Ogoni- land is not just for a particular section of people, it is a collective responsibility.

Today, we are going to start with 1,200 Ogoni women in this project.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T08:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:30:48.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
