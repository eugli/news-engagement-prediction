Tim Dracup (@TimDracup) This GSHA Newsletter gives valuable insights into latest DfE thinking on selection and the funding formula https://t.co/s0NE2OanLc February 8, 2017 \nThe newsletter detailed discussions and meetings with the education department, ministers, officials from Downing Street and Theresa May’s chief of staff, Nick Timothy. It alluded to a high degree of coordination between the government and the grammar school heads, through meetings “to flesh out what the final proposals will look like” – despite the government’s assertion that it is considering the results of its public consultation before finalising any new policy. \n“It is clear that both the Department for Education and No 10 are keen to engage and work with us on developing proposals for new grammar schools and expansion of existing ones, as well as the best ways for selective schools to support other secondaries and primary schools,” the newsletter reported. “They want to work through ideas and check with us that they are heading in the right direction.” \nThe shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, attacked the government’s “unbelievable” tactics on Twitter. Angela Rayner MP (@AngelaRayner) Unbelievable grammar school heads have been given inside track on the Govt plans while our state schools&academies are left out in the cold. February 8, 2017 \nWhile much of the notes repeat proposals already in the public domain, they show that the government remains sensitive to data showing that selection often excludes pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, with grammar school heads being urged to forward examples of “support and outreach” to the department. \nThe notes also say ministers “are considering a national selection test” to replace the 11-plus exams run by individual local authorities and schools, and quashes earlier suggestions that late developers might be able to join grammar schools beyond the age of 12 – a policy widely derided as unrealistic and which the notes describe as “problematic and likely to destabilise other schools”. \nOne comment attributed to Greening suggests the public’s response to the consultation has been mostly hostile. According to the newsletter: “Justine Greening says the response to the consultation on increasing selection was not ‘an overwhelming flood of negativity’.” \nIt adds: “Ministers and officials agree with us that there are a lot of people, who are philosophically opposed to selection, who keep saying it damages the education of other pupils but present little or no evidence to support this claim.” Grammar schools are not just socially divisive – they’re deeply ineffective | Sam Freedman Read more \nHowever, much recent research suggests otherwise, such as a paper by the Education Policy Institute last year that described how the exam results of disadvantaged pupils are lower in areas with high numbers of grammar schools. \nAn education department spokesperson said: “The ‘schools that work for everyone’ consultation closed on 12 December. As the secretary of state told the House of Commons on Monday, we have received several thousand submissions, which we are now going through. We will respond in the spring.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T08:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T03:35:14.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
