Aguirre said the suspension would be in effect until revoked. ADVERTISEMENT \n“The DOJ and the NBI will now focus its energy and resources in waging war against corruption and in waging war against criminality,” Aguirre said. \nOn Thursday, Mr. Duterte claimed that just like the PNP, he has lost trust in the NBI to carry out his campaign promise to clean up illegal drugs in the country. \n“You cannot make use of the police because it is corrupt. I cannot trust now the NBI because it is corrupt,” Mr. Duterte said in a speech at the 38th National Convention of the Philippine Association of Water Districts in Davao City. \n“Even the NBI—the bureau is suspended from enforcing the drug laws. You’re included because I have lost my trust in you,” the President said. \nMr. Duterte was forced to suspend “Oplan Tokhang” not because the body count has risen to over 7,000 in just seven months but because South Korea has protested the killing of Korean businessman Jee Ick-Joo, who was abducted and killed last October by a group of PNP and NBI officials on the pretext of arresting him for illegal drugs. \nNBI Director Dante Gierran acted on the President’s order by reshuffling four NBI officials linked to the Jee slay. \nThey are National Capital Region Director Ricardo Diaz, Deputy Director for Investigation for Investigation Service Jose Yap, Task Force Against Illegal Drugs chief Ruel Bolivar and Head Agent Darwin Lising.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T02:12:31.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
