The figures come as a blow to diehard Remain campaigners led by Tony Blair, who said the public could “change their minds” about Brexit following “real damage” to the British economy. Before the referendum, papers published by the George Osborne-led Treasury claimed “a vote to leave would represent an immediate and profound shock to our economy. That shock would push our economy into a recession and lead to an increase in unemployment”.\nMark Carney, the former Goldman Sachs employee who heads Britain’s central bank, was broadly supportive , alleging that the consequences of a Leave vote “could possibly include a technical recession”.\nReports indicate the average growth forecast has tripled since the vote, however, with today’s quarterly upgrade from 0.6 per cent to 0.7 per cent driven by strong net trade.\nUK Q4 GDP growth revised up to 0.7%q/q off the back of a big contribution from net trade. Consumers chipped in too. pic.twitter.com/YG8CGnoVlb\n— Rupert Seggins (@Rupert_Seggins) February 22, 2017\nIndustrial output, initially thought to have been flat, was revised up to 0.3 per cent. Construction output was also revised up, to 0.2 per cent, while services sector expansion was estimated at by 0.8 per cent.\nThe pound hit a two-month high against the euro, which has now fallen its lowest level against a basket of currencies since November 2016, in advance of the new figures being published.\nThe developments will be unwelcome news for former prime minister Tony Blair, who courted controversy last week when he assumed leadership of the so-called “Remain Resistance”.\nBlair called on europhile campaigners to “rise up” against Brexit, claiming that the people’s decision “was based on imperfect knowledge”.\nBrendan O'Neill on Blair's attempt to stop #Brexit #democracy pic.twitter.com/1OImkd4Xq2\n— /dev/null ❄️ (@smbthomas) February 17, 2017\n“Yes, the British people voted to leave Europe, and I agree the will of the people should prevail,” he said. “I accept, right now, there is no widespread appetite to rethink.”\nHe added the caveat, however, that it was “their right to change their minds”, telling his audience that “Our mission is to persuade them to do so”.\nBlair’s intervention provoked widespread condemnation online.\nA man who slaughtered thousands for 'democracy' overseas now wants it to be ignored in his own country.
