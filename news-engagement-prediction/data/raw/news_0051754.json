Removing admin rights thwarts all IE, Edge, Office 2016 security threats \nEven more interesting is that the Avecto 2016 report highlights that if sysadmins had forced users to utilize a low-privileged account instead of an admin-level profile, they would have mitigated 100% of all critical Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge browser vulnerabilities patched during the past year. \nThe same 100% threshold also stands for Office 2016, showing the large number of security threats a system admin could mitigate just by a proper user management policy. \n\"Times have changed; removing admin rights and controlling applications is no longer difficult to achieve,\" noted Mark Austin, co-founder, and co-CEO at Avecto, an opinion he also shared with Sami Laiho, a famous Windows security expert [ 1 , 2 ]. \nThe above statistics do not include medium and low-level security flaws because their impact was already deemed insufficient to receive a \"critical\" classification, regardless of the user level access they needed to execute from. The chart below shows the bigger picture. \nThe simple conclusion of the Avecto report is that most companies and users would be able to avoid malware infections and network compromises if they'd only follow the example of Linux users and avoid using admin accounts as their primary profiles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T02:02:53.703+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
