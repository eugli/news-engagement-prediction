We revolt simply because, for many reasons, we can no longer breathe.” \nTruly, the protests, irrespective of a few contrary opinions, were simply because the hardship in the country had become strangulating for Nigerians, Saturday Vanguard gathered. \nAccordingly, the following among others were observed as immediate and remote causes of the one-day protest by angry Nigerians: High cost of living/grinding hunger, harsh economic policies, collapse of the power sector, alleged double standards by government, absence of defined response to recession, crashed value of the naira/volatility in exchange rate, rising unemployment rate, handling of rampaging herdsmen, dysfunctional legal system , slow pace of making decisions and polarisation of Nigeria along ethnic lines. \nThese, combined to create one of the most difficult times in the history of the country. \nHigh cost of living/grinding hardship \nFor anyone living in the country at the moment, life has been reduced to a harrowing experience as a result of the escalating prices of goods and services. \nThis situation has brought about widespread hunger especially among middle-income earners, low-income earners, and commoners. \nVirtually every commodity has witnessed over 100 percent increase in price since 2015, resulting in low purchasing power. \nEven staple food items that are locally produced, are affected by the escalating prices. \nSince virtually everyone is a victim, it was not surprising that many apart from those in positions of authority, their supporters and hangers-on supported the protests. \nThe role this factor played in provoking the exercise was better articulated by the Acting President, Prof Yemi Osinbajo in a speech acknowledging the grouse of protesters. \n“We are in a serious economic situation and the President was particularly concerned about the lot of the common man. And I quote him, “Recession today for many, for some its means not being able to pay school fees, for others not being able to afford the high cost of rice and millet and for most of our young people recession means joblessness, ’he stated. \nHarsh economic policies \nBefore now, experts and non-specialists had frowned at some economic policies of the present administration, with the consensus that it was accentuating the economic crisis. \nFor instance, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, IMF, had in October 2016 urged the Federal Government to come up with an economic blueprint. \nLatching on its understanding of the dynamics of the Nigerian economy, a leading global financial magazine, The Economist dismissed the fiscal policies of the administration. \nThe surprising disposition of the UK-based magazine, which supported Buhari in the 2015 presidential election, came a few days after Financial Times termed the same fiscal policies as the height of foolishness. \nTwo former governors of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Prof Charles Soludo and Emir of Kano, Alhaji Mohammadu Sanusi had reasoned in that direction. \nSoludo had said that the President’s economic policies, since 2015, were still based on campaign promises. \nHowever, some policies Saturday Vanguard found not have been widely accepted include fixed exchange rate, forex restrictions, implementation of Treasury Single Account, TSA, politics of naira devaluation and banning of some items the country had no comparative strength of producing among others. \nDelay in making key decisions \nIn the estimation of most Nigerians, this administration is famed for not being apt in the area of making critical decisions. \nAnalysts have argued that some policy actions of the government often come belated when the issues they were expected to have addressed had become complex. \nThose easily referenced are the delay in the appointment of ministers and heads of parastatals, delay in the appointment of ambassadors, delay in the appointment of National Commissioners of Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC and delay in 2016 budget presentation among others. More disturbing is their failure to take decisions that can improve the economy. All calls to higher or engage a sound economic team have been ignored. \nThis trend is believed to have resulted in the seeming lack of pace in the business of governing Nigeria. \nCollapse of power sector \nCurrently, power generation and distribution is still a challenge as most cities, towns, and villages are in darkness, the billions of money spent on the sector nothwitstanding. \nInstructively the highest generation so far recorded was the generation of 5074.7MW February 2, 2016, while the highest maximum daily energy wheeled nationwide was 109,372MWH on the same day. \nUnfortunately, that achievement meant nothing till date as the generation level has continued to hoover between 3,730.5 MW as of February 9, 2017, and 2,662MW(the amount recorded on January 2, 2017. \nSaturday Vanguard learnt that the generation is not the core problem, but distribution as a result of obsolete transmission equipment. \nThe worsened power challenge has increased the fuel consumption rate of most people, who spend much now to power their generators at homes and offices. \nAnother worrisome aspect of the energy crisis in Nigeria is the high tariff being charged for the insignificant electricity supplied. \nRising unemployment rate \nIn nearly two years, the unemployment rate in the country has witnessed a steady rise in percentage. \nThe National Bureau of Statistics had in December 2016, stated that Nigeria’s unemployment rate rose from 13.3 percent in the second quarter to 13.9 percent in the third quarter of 2016. \nThe report stated that the number of unemployed increased by 555,311 persons. \nHowever, the trend which is a common social challenge in Nigeria became more alarming with the loss of jobs brought about by the recession. \nMany Nigerians were thrown to the streets by their employers as a cost cutting measure. \nThe seriousness of the scourge was evident from the inscription of unemployment among the challenges listed on the placards of most protesters. \nEven though the Federal Government had cautioned companies against sacking their workers, most organizations are still laying off workers in large numbers. \nAbsence of defined response to recession \nMost Nigerians are alarmed by the absence of an economic blueprint aimed at tackling the country’s economic woes. \nHarping on historical experiences where nations had used concretized fiscal road-maps to emerge stronger from a downturn, there are concerns that the government is yet to have a blueprint in the face of the worst economic crisis in Nigeria’s history. \nAt the moment, the vehicle through which the government intends surviving the meltdown is still unclear, as experts keep demanding a work plan. \nThat the government had recorded some gains in some areas did not stop observers from maintaining that its fiscal policies were less holistic and impactful. \nThe list of those, who hold this view is endless, as many had spoken to Saturday Vanguard in confidence and others made theirs public. \nFor instance, the World Bank and IMF, an investigation by this paper, revealed, mounted pressure on the government to come up with an economic blueprint, if its drive for foreign loans was not to be stalled. \nThis delay in coming up with a plan is believed to be accentuating the economic woes thereby prolonging the lifespan of the recession. \nAt the moment, the economy is reportedly growing at two percent with a high inflation rate of 18.5 percent. \nCrashed value of the naira/Inflation \nNigeria’s currency which used to be among the strongest in Africa has lost over 100 percent of its value. \nWith the 2017 budget pegging the exchange rate at 305 to 1$, the naira has continued to crash in the parallel market. \nThe currency had in January crashed further to N500 to a dollar at the parallel market after it had remained stable for nearly three weeks. \nThe Pound Sterling and the Euro also crashed to N616 and N530 respectively at the open market. \nSince 2015, the rate of inflation has been on the rise successively. \nToday, virtually most Nigerians are groaning given that the valueless state of the naira has brought extreme hunger and other forms of hardship in the country. \nThe fact that this is happening unabated leaves the populace frustrated about what the days ahead hold. \nHandling of rampaging herdsmen \nMost Nigerians are alarmed by the manner the disposition of the administration towards the mass killings being done by Fulani herdsmen across the country. \nFor a government that had excelled in decimating the capacity of Boko Haram insurgents to commit mass murder, its seeming silence on most murderous activities being perpetrated by Fulani herdsmen, leaves most people surprised and irritated. \nFor instance, the administration’s handling of the massacres in Agatu and Southern Kaduna was mostly considered unimpressive. \nUnfortunately, such attitude is giving rise to the notion that the government had applied double standards in responding to some national challenges. \nPolarisation of Nigeria along ethnic lines \nThe pulse of a cross section of Nigerians is that the present administration had in policies and appointments, favoured some ethnic groupings against others. \nThose, who hold this position, maintain that the North is more favoured in this dispensation in manners that rubbished the contents of the Federal Character Principles. \nThis is one factor that Saturday Vanguard found to be irritating the larger South, especially the South East extraction. \nThis feeling which had long existed was recently re-echoed by a former Military Administrator of Kaduna State, Col Umar Dangiwa, retd, who claimed that the administration’s pro-North disposition was dividing Nigeria. \nDangiwa, who said this against the backdrop of the delayed appointment of Justice Walter Onnoghen as the substantive Chief Justice of Nigeria, said: ‘’The unity of the nation has already been pushed to the precipice by the recruitment and appointment policies of a government which tends to favour the north in violation of the Federal Character provision of the constitution.” \n", "external_links": [], "published":
