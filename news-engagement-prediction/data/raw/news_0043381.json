Picture: Andrew Taylor Staff writers News Corp Australia Network Share Share on Twitter \nA TURNBULL government MP who is helping shape Australia’s future policy on housing affordability, has said the first step to buying a house is to get a “highly paid” job. \nFederal Victorian Liberal MP Michael Sukkar told Sky News that the government was doing what it could to get young people into highly paid jobs. \n“We’re also enabling young people to get highly paid jobs, which is the first step to buying a house,” he said. \n“It’s not the only answer, but it’s the first step and I think this idea that we’re arguing for corporate tax cuts because somehow we love big corporates is absolutely ridiculous.” \nMr Sukkar’s comments come after former treasurer Joe Hockey sparked controversy after he said first home buyers should be to find a “good job that pays good money”. \nAt the time, his comments were in relation to the Sydney housing market. He was criticised for being out of touch with Australians. \nMr Sukkar, who is the Assistant Minister to Treasurer Scott Morrison, said the government’s $48.7 billion company tax cut policy would help Australians “forge a career”.

But now if we don’t have that investment coming into our country those opportunities will dry up for really excellent young Australians.” \nLiberal MP David Coleman stood by Mr Sukkar’s comments on ABC radio today, telling listeners increasing taxes would not help pave the way for more affordable housing. \n“Clearly people who have the financial capacity to buy a home are in a good position to do so,” he said. \n“The way to address issues of housing affordability is not to increase taxes, it is to improve supply.” \nMr Sukkar said the Coalition had no plan to reduce the capital gains tax discount. \n“If you cap negative gearing and you reduce the discount in the way Labor’s proposed, you suck investment out of residential property which means you make it harder for first-home buyers, more expensive for renters and you ultimately reduce jobs in residential construction,” Mr Sukkar said. \nBut Labor MP Tim Watts criticised Mr Sukkar’s comments today on Twitter, saying the Coalition was “back to where Joe Hockey started on housing affordability”.
