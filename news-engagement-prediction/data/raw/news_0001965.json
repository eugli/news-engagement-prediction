Gene Wu, D-Houston, a co-author of the bill. \"It is outrageous that our state cannot do something as simple as dealing with distracted drivers.\" \nMany of the families and advocates have met during previous legislative sessions. This is the fifth time Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo, and the fourth time Rep. Tom Craddick, R-Midland, have filed legislation to ban texting while driving. AT&T joined the news conference, giving legislators and visitors a chance to use a Texting While Driving Simulator. \nHouse Bill 62 and Senate Bill 31 would make using a phone while driving a misdemeanor offense, punishable by a fine ranging from $25 to $99 with penalties up to $200 for repeat offenders. \n\"I'm disheartened to say that we're still at it,\" said Rep. Eddie Lucio III, D-Brownsville, a co-author of the House bill. \"This is what drinking and driving used to be to previous generations.\" \nDuring the 2015 legislative session , the bill easily passed the House but didn't receive enough votes to reach the Senate floor. Craddick came close to passing the bill in 2011 after it passed the House and the Senate but died at former Gov. Rick Perry's behest. Perry called the legislation \"a government effort to micromanage the behavior of adults.\" \n\"I need the tools to be able to stop this,\" said Officer Don Egdorf, chief of Houston's traffic enforcement unit. Houston has more fatal car crashes than any Texas city, and Egdorf said he has seen a stark increase in preventable accidents as smart phones have gained popularity. \n\"This is not a joke,\" he said. \"This has to be something that stops.\" \nLawmakers and advocates this year are trying to appeal to the Legislature's concern for the Texas economy, using terms like \"crash tax\" and stressing corporations' insurance liability if employees text while driving during the workday. \n\"We need to find another angle,\" said Dallas attorney Todd Clement, who has taken on several distracted driving cases. \"This state prides itself on its pro-business atmosphere. So we need to tell our legislators that this texting bill isn't bad for business, it's good for business.\" \nA clear law that has the power of the enforcement can give Texas businesses the ammunition they need to protect their bottom line from the liability of texting while driving, Clement said. \nTexas is one of four states that does not have a texting while driving ban. The state does ban drivers in school zones, under the age of 18 or bus drivers with minors on board from using phones while driving. More than 95 counties in Texas have passed local ordinances banning some form of cellphone use while driving to fill the legislative gap. \n\"How many people have to die?\"said Mike Myers, whose daughter Alana, an 18-year-old Texas Tech student, died after crashing her car while texting. \"It's time to make a difference. One life is too many.\" \nMyers, holding a photo of his daughter's grave, appealed to Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Gov. Greg Abbott to pass the bill and not wait until the last day of the legislative session. \n\"We lost a beautiful child, and I will just simply say: I don't get to hear her voice, I don't get to hear her laugh,\" he said. \"Instead, we get to go to the cemetery.\" HB 62/ SB 31 @PCIAA @Dan_Flynn getting the word out on texting while driving! @TXlege pic.twitter.com/FSQbQCa4J2 — Maggie Irwin (@MaggieFitz) February 2, 2017 View Comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:10:46.852+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
