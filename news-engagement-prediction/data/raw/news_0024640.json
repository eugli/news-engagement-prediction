In Myanmar, hardline monks of the ultra- nationalist Ma Ba Tha group have been fuelling sentiment against the Muslim Rohingya. Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.

Mr Sulak urged governments to make hate speech illegal, given its ability to incite violence. “I agree with freedom of speech, you can have different opinions and you can discuss openly. But if you use hate speech and distorted speech… this should not be allowed,” he said. \nBut how is it possible that a religion of peace and empathy like Buddhism can fall prey to hate? \nWHEN FEAR OVERRULES SYMPATHY \nDr Mano Laohanavich, professor of Buddhism at Thammasat University, suggested that some Buddhists lack an understanding about other religions. \n“They study only their book, their text, which is exclusively about their own truth. And this truth must be the one… that is the best, the only,” he said. \nAnd when they believe their values to be paramount, they disregard other religions, or even fear that their own is under threat, said Dr Eakpant Pindavanija, a director at the Institute of Human Rights and Peace Studies at Mahidol University. \nHe cited the example of the Rohingya refugees in Thailand - how an initial wave of pity for these migrants turned into anger once some Thai people realised they were Muslims. \n“Suddenly … the hate speech comes: ‘Oh! They are here because they want to destroy this country, they want to destroy our Buddhist society’… So the feeling of sympathy has gone,” Dr Eakpant said. \nWHEN FEAR OVERRULES WISDOM \nThe average Buddhist also does not really understand the teachings of Buddhism itself, its true purpose and meaning, said Dr Chantana Banpasirichote Wun’gaeo, an Associate Professor (Department of Government) at Chulalongkorn University. \nAlso, where there is a religious majority and a minority, it’s usual for the majority to think “we decide and you have to follow our ways”, said Dr Mano. \n”They use identity as the principle on which to create difference, and the politics of fear overrules wisdom or compassion,” he added. In Thailand 95 per cent of the population is Buddhist.

He cited the example of how the earthquake in Kaohsiung, Taiwan years ago galvanised Buddhists, Muslims and Catholics to join in rescue efforts. \nWhen such varied faiths get together, “that could be very powerful - not because they are different but because they are united”, said Dr Mano. \nMr Sulak provided hope for the situation in Myanmar. Arguing that the incidences of Buddhist monks attacking Rohingya were perpetrated by a minority, and tended to dominate the news, he noted that in actuality in Myanmar: “A lot of Buddhists and Muslims are working together beautifully.” \nThe episode ' Buddhism in Thailand' on Between The Lines discusses the place of Buddhism in Thai public life and culture, as well as the rise in nationalist Buddhist sentiments across Asia.
