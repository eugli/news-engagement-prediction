Nowadays, there’s no escape online from Valentine’s Day irritation, as soppy couples infect our social feeds too. Here are the 11 types of posts we’d happily consign to the heart-shaped bin… \nRELATED: 7 Instagram Commandments Every Happy Couple Should Follow \nLengthy odes to their other half “OK, so normally I don't post things like this but…” is how these horrors start, before launching into how they’re the kindest, sweetest, funniest, most beautiful creature on the planet. You’re so #lucky, #grateful and #blessed that they bestowed their love on little old you. They’ve always “been there” for you. So why don’t you tell them “IRL”, rather than making the rest of us feel faintly nauseous with your epic essay? (And also silently quibble about how average and not-that-amazing they are.) \nA montage of gloating gift pics Especially with the caption “boy done good” or “my girl rules”. \nCasually checking into a posh restaurant What? I wasn’t humblebragging, honest, I just needed wi-fi access. Because, um, that’s really romantic. \nDate night pics For starters, calling it “ date night ” is deeply lame. And for second, pity the poor waiter having to capture your fake smiles, practised poses and raised prosecco glasses for posterity. He hates you. \nUsing the words “bae”/“hubby”/“wifey” Sub-rule: pretending it’s ironic doesn’t make it acceptable. \nOr pet names. Or the heart eyes emoji Desist immediately. \nPictures of them kissing Put it away, people. We can pretty much hear the slurping and lip-smacking from here. Also, how many attempts did it take to snog while taking a selfie at the same time? Or did you get someone else to take it for you? Either way, such PDAs are sick and wrong. \nPics of bouquets of flowers Yeah, yeah, we get it. You got flowers . You’ll carry them home on the train with a poorly suppressed smirk on your face, looking all coy when you catch someone’s eye. We don’t need to see endless photos too. They all look the same, for a start: clichéd red roses, garage forecourt carnations or flouncy pink arrangements that makes us feel hayfeverish. And how do you think the girl sitting at the next desk who got no flowers will feel as you smugly snap away, showing off about your lovability? So stop it, Titchmarsh. \nCutesy cards made by their kids “I wuv oo, bestest mummy in the wurld!!!” written in ham-fisted crayon, with deformed lovehearts that look more like goat kidneys. Not only nauseating but isn’t it a bit… well, incest-y? Often posted by the same “aren’t my ickle ones adorbz?” types who post made-up things their darlings have supposedly said about Donald Trump. \nAnything lingerie-related Oh sweet Christ, we can’t look. Oversharey and weird. Like weeing and rubbing your butt all over someone to mark them as your territory. \nIn fact, anything suggesting they’ve just had sex We’ve just brought a bit of our lunch up into our mouths. It’s like picturing your parents “doing it”. Show comments", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T06:03:13.485+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
