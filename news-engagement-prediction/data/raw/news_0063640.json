By: FE Online | Published: February 23, 2017 5:17 PM Any other information from the customer should be sought separately with his/her consent and after opening the account. \nNew Delhi: The RBI has imposed a penalty of Rs 4 lakh on Progressive Co-operative Bank, Mumbai, for violating guidelines on KYC, lending to nominal members and financing NBFC, according to an ANI report. \nHere we are taking a look at the RBI’s general and KYC guidelines: \nGeneral Guidelines: Banks should keep in mind that the information collected from the customer for the purpose of opening of account is to be treated as confidential and details thereof are not to be divulged for cross selling or any other like purposes. Banks should, therefore, ensure that information sought from the customer is relevant to the perceived risk, is not intrusive, and is in conformity with the guidelines issued in this regard. \nAny other information from the customer should be sought separately with his/her consent and after opening the account. Banks should ensure that any remittance of funds by way of demand draft, mail/telegraphic transfer or any other mode and issue of travellers’ cheques for value of Rs 50,000 and above is effected by debit to the customer’s account or against cheques and not against cash payment \nYou may also watch: \nWith effect from April 1, 2012, banks should not make payment of cheques/drafts/pay orders/banker’s cheques bearing that date or any subsequent date, if they are presented beyond the period of three months from the date of such instrument. \nBanks should ensure that the provisions of Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010, wherever applicable, are strictly adhered to. \nKYC Policy \nBanks should frame their KYC policies incorporating the following four key elements: \nCustomer Acceptance Policy: Every bank should develop a clear Customer Acceptance Policy laying down explicit criteria for acceptance of customers. The Customer Acceptance Policy must ensure that explicit guidelines are in place on the following aspects of customer relationship in the bank. \nCustomer Identification Procedures: The policy approved by the board of banks should clearly spell out the Customer Identification Procedure to be carried out at different stages, i.e., while establishing a banking relationship; carrying out a financial transaction or when the bank has a doubt about the authenticity/veracity or the adequacy of the previously obtained customer identification data. Customer identification means identifying the customer and verifying his/her identity by using reliable, independent source documents, data or information. \nMonitoring of Transactions: Ongoing monitoring is an essential element of effective KYC procedures. Banks can effectively control and reduce their risk only if they have an understanding of the normal and reasonable activity of the customer so that they have the means of identifying transactions that fall outside the regular pattern of activity. However, the extent of monitoring will depend on the risk sensitivity of the account. Banks should pay special attention to all complex, unusually large transactions and all unusual patterns which have no apparent economic or visible lawful purpose. \nYou may also watch: \nRisk Management: The Board of Directors of the bank should ensure that an effective KYC programme is put in place by establishing appropriate procedures and ensuring their effective implementation. It should cover proper management oversight, systems and controls, segregation of duties, training and other related matters. Responsibility should be explicitly allocated within the bank for ensuring that the bank’s policies and procedures are implemented effectively. \nFor more details, visit the RBI website.
