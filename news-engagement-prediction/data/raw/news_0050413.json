(CBC)\n\"The Saint John works department and the Saint John fire department do get around as much as we can to try and clean out as many hydrants as we can, but with the snow that we've had in the last little while, it is a challenge.\"\nThe 12-unit New Brunswick Housing brick building was evacuated and no one was injured, although crews were still searching for a couple of pets, Voutour said.\nA city transit bus was brought in to keep the displaced tenants warm.\nPlatoon chief Steve Voutour said it appears the fire was sparked when electricians inadvertently cut a power line. (CBC)\nVoutour said he expected tenants to be able to return to the building once all the smoke was cleared.\nBroad Street was blocked off between Wentworth and Carmarthen streets during the emergency response.\nThe official cause of the fire has not yet been determined, but Voutour said electricians had been working in the three-storey building and it appears they inadvertently cut a power line, which sparked the blaze.\n\"Depending on the type of wire that you're dealing with, you could have upwards of 240 volts, and in a dry structure, it gets into dust and wood fibres and paper and things of that nature in the structure itself, and it doesn't take much to start a fire.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T22:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T06:37:59.759+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
