Story continues below \nOn August 4, 2010, at 8:50 p.m., emergency crews responded to a report of a fire at her home. Neighbours in the Merritton community rushed to the scene of the blaze and Beirnes could be heard shouting for help from the basement. \nREAD MORE: Police in Ontario using new technology to help solve 1998 slaying \nFirefighters located her inside the home, but police said she was unable to escape the fire because she was tied up. \nBeirnes was eventually rescued from the burning home and rushed to hospital, but died from smoke inhalation a day later. \n“This is a 74-year-old woman that lived alone; she was bound and left essentially to die in a fire,” Niagara Regional Police Const. Virginia Moir said Thursday. “This is the only unsolved [homicide in St. Catharines] since 2010.” \nREAD MORE: Toronto mother still searching for answers 10 years after son’s murder \nOn Thursday, six and a half years after her death, police posted a significant reward for information leading to an arrest and are hoping someone who knows something about the case will come forward. \nMoir said the reward was put forth as soon as approval from the Police Services Board was granted instead of on a significant date or anniversary of the case, which is common in other homicide investigations. \n“Anyone that may have been reluctant in the past that has information, this would be an incentive for them to come forward and assist police,” she said. \n“It’s been an ongoing investigation since 2010, so leads have been followed, we’re just hoping that someone has information. People talk — and we’re hoping that can help us.” \nREAD MORE: Ontario family seeks closure after 7-year-old girl goes missing 42 years ago \nInvestigators said they are determined to bring those responsible to justice to provide closure to the Beirnes family. \nAnyone with information or evidence in the investigation into Beirnes’ death is asked to contact Niagara Regional Police Det.-Sgt. Jamie Munro at 905-688-4111 or Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477). © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
