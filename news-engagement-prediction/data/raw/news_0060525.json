The bodies seem to have been strangled before they were put into the salon car and abandoned at the Gitaru interchange, Kabete division. \nPolice and witnesses said the car had been at the site since Wednesday morning until night hours when an owner of a nearby apartment called police to check it out. \nThe owner of the apartment had initially thought the car was parked there by mechanics at a nearby garage when he first saw it on Wednesday morning. \nHe reportedly called one of the mechanics and asked him why he had left the car for that long but the man denied knowledge of it. It was then that he called police, said Central DCI boss Michael Baraza. \n“The car's windows were tinted and so many people did not bother to check on the occupants because they thought it had been parked by mechanics working at a nearby garage,” said Baraza. \nSpeculations are that the killers parked the car at the scene on Tuesday night or Wednesday dawn. \nWhen officers arrived they found the car locked and broke into it and found two bodies in the boot and two others in the backseat. \nThey all had marks on the necks an indication of strangulation. \nThe identities of the men are yet to be known and witnesses say they seem to have been killed elsewhere and bodied dumped there. \nThey were bodies were later taken to the mortuary as a probe was launched. Police intend to take their fingerprints to enable them identify the bodies even as they appealed to those with missing kin and friends to visit City Mortuary.
