AP Photo/Andrew Harnik \nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday gave an extended press conference blasting the media, occasionally seeming to anticipate how reporters would cover the briefing. \nAfter briefly announcing his new pick to lead the US Department of Labor, the president launched into an extended tirade lamenting media coverage, particularly taking aim at reports of the leaks about Trump campaign's relationship with Russia and Trump's calls with foreign leaders. \n\"I turn on the TV, open the newspapers, and I see stories of chaos, chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a fine-tuned machine,\" Trump said. \nAt Thursday's press conference, he fell back on similar attacks on media, rattling off attacks on the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal for reporting on intelligence and law enforcement probes into his campaign's ties with Russia. \nThe president slammed the press, saying media outlets were \"out of control,\" insisting that reporters \"should be ashamed of themselves\" for reporting on the leaks. \n\"The leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake,\" Trump said. \nAs the news conference continued, the president began a running commentary of reporters who he saw as sympathetic versus those who asked him tough questions. \n\"I want to find a friendly reporter. Are you a friendly reporter?\" Trump asked at one point. \"Watch how friendly he is.\" \nBefore taking his next question, President Trump says, \"I want to find a friendly reporter.\" https://t.co/FNDVCjmrlW — MSNBC (@MSNBC) February 16, 2017 \nTrump particularly took aim at CNN, claiming — without singling out any particular specific issues — that he sees \"many untruthful things\" in the network's reporting. \n\"You look at your show that goes on at 10 in the evening. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusively anti-Trump. The good news is he doesn't have good ratings,\" Trump said. \nThe president continued: \"When I go to rallies they start screaming at CNN, they want to throw their placards at CNN. I think you would do much better by being different. But just take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening, if a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it's brutal. Now they'll take this news conference — I'm actually having a very good time. Don't forget, that's how I won, I used to give a news conference every day. That's how I won, with news conference, and probably speeches. I certainly didn't win with people listening to you people. But I'm having a good time. Tomorrow they will say 'Donald Trump rants and raves.' I'm not ranting and raving. I'm just telling you people.\" \n. @POTUS Donald Trump asks whether CNN reporter Jim Acosta is related to his Labour Secretary Pick, Alexander Acosta https://t.co/d7i1bwyY8k pic.twitter.com/uVhr3uTQX4 — BBC News (World) (@BBCWorld) February 16, 2017 \nThough reporting on his statements and internal staff strife regularly provoked verbal outrage from Trump on the campaign trail, he's been equally vocally outraged at the media in his first weeks in the White House. \nVisiting the CIA, the president called journalists \" the most dishonest people on earth \" for correctly reporting the size of his inauguration crowd.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T02:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T21:24:16.345+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
