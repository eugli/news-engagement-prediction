REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson By John Foley | LONDON \nLONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mistakes happen. It’s what happens next that counts. Sunday's Academy Awards gaffe that saw the wrong film named as best picture may leave the ceremony’s accounting partner with a sense of déjà vu. PricewaterhouseCoopers flubbed its job of handing closely guarded voting results to presenters, resulting in \"La La Land\" being mistakenly awarded the Oscar until the error and the real winner, \"Moonlight\", were finally announced in the middle of the third \"La La Land\" acceptance speech. \nPwC’s day job, which has included auditing scandal-hit companies from Colonial Bank to Tesco and BT, might have served as a warning. Financial firms dealing with past misdemeanours, like Deutsche Bank and JPMorgan, will also recognize the pattern. Most embarrassing corporate moments tend to have at least three actors: the person who commits the deception or error, the person who fails to notice, and the person who notices but doesn’t do anything. \nFirst came a mistake that was clearly PwC's. It handed the presenters the wrong envelope. On its own, that needn’t have turned into a fiasco. As it was, though, actor Warren Beatty, who spotted the problem, said nothing, leaving it to fellow presenter Faye Dunaway to blurt out the wrong result. The PwC representatives in the wings surely knew immediately, and the show's producers must have learnt quickly, yet it took minutes to halt proceedings. \nPwC, which makes quite a show of protecting the top-secret Academy Awards briefcases, apologized after the ceremony. No real harm was done – it’s a tale of fallibility rather than blame. Auditors are expected to spot dud numbers, but to do so they rely on process and human judgement, both of which can fail. The moment when everyone is comfortable that nothing can go wrong is the time mistakes will inevitably happen. That's a lesson for auditing, too.

Next In Breakingviews Breakdown: China swaps bad debt for faint hope \nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China's debt-to-equity swap plan is a complicated attempt to carry out a corporate turnaround in the People's Republic. The government-backed scheme, launched in mid-2016, is designed to ease the burden on the country's heavily indebted state-owned enterprises. By mid-January, banks and borrowers had agreed to convert loans worth approximately 300 billion yuan ($43.5 billion) into shares, according to a Reuters analysis. Review: Steven Cohen’s enduring edge \nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Steven Cohen is a litmus test of people’s views about finance and its role in society. Is the billionaire hedge-fund manager a supremely gifted trader or a pathological rule-breaker? Is he a self-made man or an avatar of the ultra-wealthy? Is he an art connoisseur or a crass arriviste? Carlyle hedges against American greatness \nDALLAS (Reuters Breakingviews) - Like any good private-equity investor, Carlyle has demonstrated a knack for buying when others are selling, and vice versa. It’s instructive then that the firm led by David Rubenstein is embarking on its biggest quest for distressed assets at a time when tax-cut hopes are fanning Wall Street euphoria. The $2.5 billion fund is a good reminder that lofty valuations, an aging recovery and a chaotic new administration can produce bad outcomes.
