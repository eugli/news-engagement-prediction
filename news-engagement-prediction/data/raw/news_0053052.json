Photo: Alan Putra \nMr Taylor believed the bag had been stolen. He approached Mr Sudarsa, a Balinese police officer of 35 years, but believed him to be a bogus cop when he allegedly laughed after Mr Taylor asked him for assistance. \nMr Taylor admitted to \"searching his body\" but said Mr Sudarsa then pushed him to the ground and punched him. At one point, he testified, Mr Sudarsa's arm was on his throat. \n\"I couldn't breathe. I was afraid I was going to die. I never experienced it before - I was really scared,\" Mr Taylor told a court hearing last month. \nMr Sudarsa's bloodied corpse was found near Ms Connor's identity cards on August 17, with 42 wounds to his body. However Mr Taylor insists that he had still been breathing when he last checked the body. \nA forensic doctor testified that Mr Sudarsa may have lived if he had received medical treatment in the two hours before he died. \nMr Taylor said outside the court on February 1 it made him feel \"extremely sad\" and a \"little bit angry\" witnesses who claimed to have seen Mr Sudarsa on the beach and did nothing to help him. \nMs Connor, who owned a fresh pasta business in Byron Bay and is the mother of two young boys, has denied she had anything to do with the police officer's death. She says her only involvement was to try to separate the two men when they were fighting in the sand. \nThe couple told the court they had tried to go to police station but an ojek (motorcycle taxi) driver refused to take them. Instead, they bought cigarettes and returned to their homestay in Kuta, Kubu Kauh Inn. \nThey showered and then Ms Connor cut up Mr Sudarsa's identity cards, which were in the wallet Mr Taylor had taken from the victim. This was her idea, Mr Taylor, revealed, but both insisted it was to protect the victim from identity theft. \nThe couple checked out of Kubu Kauh Inn at 7am on August 17 and travelled to Jimbaran, which was \"a much nicer area than Kuta\". \nThey claimed they only learned the victim had died when Ms Connor was contacted by a friend on August 19, who said her name was all over the news after her identity cards had been found at the crime scene. \n\"I didn't feel guilty until I learnt the full consequence of the fight which was two days later,\" Mr Taylor said earlier this month. \nThe couple were in tears and \"desperate\" after learning of Mr Sudarsa's death and Mr Taylor burnt the clothes they had been wearing the night of the fight. \nThey then went to the Australian consulate in Bali and were later apprehended by police. \nMr Taylor's father, John, a retired Baptist minister, his mother Elizabeth and brother Peter, have regularly attended the trial but did not address the court. \nHowever Joe Willem Dawson, a friend of 20 years, described Mr Taylor as an \"honest and gentle man\" who was not a drinker.
