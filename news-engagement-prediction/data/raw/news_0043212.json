More videos Rohingya woman 'pursued' after rape allegations \n25-year-old Rohingya woman Jamalida Begum feared for her life after telling journalists how she and other women had been raped by military personnel. \nFollowing an international outcry over allegations of widespread human rights abuses by Myanmar security forces and Buddhist tribal groups in the state, the government allowed selected Myanmar journalists to visit the area in December. \nAs the journalists toured Rohingya villages, where killings, rapes and arson had been reported, most Rohingya avoided interaction with them. Related Content Where is the outrage about Myanmar's devastating cruelty? \nHowever a few, including 25-year-old Rohingya woman Jamalida Begum, took courage and shared their experiences. \n\"I told them how other Rohingya women there and I had been brutally raped by the military,\" she told Fairfax Media. Advertisement \nSoon after the December visit, interviews with Begum and two other villagers - a man called Sona Mia and a woman called Noorjahan - were shown on Myanmar TV channels. \nSona Mia, a Rohingya from the village of Ngakura, was found murdered a day after he spoke to the journalists. For Begum, it was a clear message.

I wanted the world to know of it. So, I took the risk to tell everything about the torture to the journalists. \n\"Many women around us had been raped by the Burmese soldiers, police and Mog [a Buddhist tribe] men. But, most were afraid of retaliation from the government and so they did not come forward,\" she adds.

SHARE Noorjahan and her six-year-old daughter. Photo: Saiful Islam \nSoon after the TV interviews, the Myanmar government issued a statement saying that several neighbours of the two women had reported to the authorities that their rape allegations were \"not true\". \nThe government also said that since Begum and Noorjahan had fled their villages, it could not investigate the rape charges. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Four Rohingya women at a refugee camp near Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. All four said that they fled their villages in Myanmar's Rakhine state after being raped. Photo: Saiful Islam \nBut Begum and Noorjahan say they are still being pursued. \nIn January, a Myanmar official accompanied by foreigners - by which the women mean people who were not Burmese or Bangladeshi - reached the Rohingya refugee camp in Cox's Bazar where Begum and Noorjahan have taken shelter. \nBegum said she recognised this official, who had visited her village in December, when she said to him and other Myanmar officials how she had been raped by three soldiers in November. \n\"I was shocked to see that official at the refugee camp,\" she said. \"[He] asked me why I had fled Burma. I replied that the security agencies were hounding me ... when he asked if I wanted to go back to [Myanmar], I replied in the negative,\" she told Fairfax Media. \n\"Are [Myanmar officials] still tracking Noorjahan and me for some reason?\" \nAs Begum and Noorjahan did not enter Bangladesh legally, the UN refugee agency cannot support them and they are forced to live on handouts provided by local charities. \nFormer UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, third from right, speaks to Rohingya villagers during a visit to Rakhine state in December. The man who took this photo, Noor Hossain, has now been missing for over two months.

Soon after, Myanmar police launched a hunt for those Rohingya who told the former UN secretary-general about abuses committed by the security forces. Two people who spoke out were arrested. \nYanghee Lee, the UN's special rapporteur on Myanmar, visited northern Rakhine in January to investigate allegations of rights violations by security forces. Aung Aung, a Rakhine-based activist, said that military officials had threatened villagers with punishment if they sought to meet Ms Lee. \n\"It's clear that the military authority does not want Rohingyas to tell the outside world how they are being killed and tortured in Myanmar,\" Aung said. \nMs Lee will arrive in Bangladesh on Monday to resume her investigation. In Cox's Bazar, she is scheduled to meet scores of Rohingya rape survivors and others who have fled Myanmar in recent weeks. \nYanghee Lee, UN special rapporteur to Myanmar. Photo: AP \nAt least two other Rohingya men who met Mr Annan have fled to Bangladesh, Aung added. \nMatthew Smith, chief executive officer of the group Fortify Rights , said that Myanmar is a \"dangerous place to be a truth teller\". \n\"There is a practical effect to reprisals - they instil fear and terror among the population and discourage others from speaking out,\" Smith said. \n\"We documented how state security forces hunted a Rohingya man who met with foreign ambassadors who in November visited Maungdaw. The authorities tracked him through multiple villages and at one point opened fire on him. He managed to escape to Bangladesh … The commissions appointed by the government have failed to account for this trend, as well as other grave violations,\" he added. \n\"The time for a UN-mandated independent international investigation is now.\" Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T13:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:58:26.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
