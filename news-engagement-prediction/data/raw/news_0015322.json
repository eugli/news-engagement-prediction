I’ve got you covered. “#UnlimitedMoves with Justin Bieber” from T-Mobile \nJustin Bieber’s never been so well-behaved and mature. “Yearbooks” from Honda \nCelebrating 20 years of the Honda CR-V, the automaker is also honoring “the people who chase their dreams with reckless abandon.” \nYou just might see a few familiar faces in the bunch! “Arnold’s One Liners” from Mobile Strike \nIf you’ve missed Arnold Schwarzenegger saying phrases like, “get to the chopper” and “hasta la vista, baby,” this one is for you. “Romance” from Skittles \nWhat if your entire family had the chance to taste the rainbow at the expense of your obsessed lover? “Cleaner of your Dreams” from Mr. Clean \nThis is how your mom really feels about Mr. Clean. Don’t tell dad, though… “Brady Everyday” from Intel \nWhat’s a Patriots Super Bowl without a Tom Brady commercial in which he says a total of four whole words? “#AmericaIsBeautiful” from Coca-Cola \nThis one’s self-explanatory. “Humpty Fall” from Turbo Tax \nThis is, you know, in case you’ve been worrying about what Humpty Dumpty’s been up to. Oh, and don’t forget to file your taxes! “Not So Pee Wee Football” from Buick \nThis advertisement stars Cam Newton and Miranda Kerr. What are a bunch of “big game” commercials if there isn’t at least one about actual football? “Born the Hard Way” from Budweiser \nThis one takes the cake. \nWhoever came up with this timely advertisement for Budweiser deserves a raise and a half. Let’s just say supporting President Trump’s controversial immigration ban and drinking a Bud don’t mix.
