Blind Date was a firm Saturday night favourite (Photo: ITV) \n“It’s a classic format that will be rebooted to make it young, sexy and modern. Expect sparks to fly. \n“In an age of Tinder, you have got to earn the right to love on this show.” \nThe show will be produced by So Television – which makes The Graham Norton Show – and Stellify Media, a company part-owned by Sony Pictures Television. Cilla Black talking to Blind Date contestants \nThe show is expected to appeal to “a new generation of viewers” while keeping some of the “traditions of the past”. \nThere’s likely to be six or eight episodes in the first series – that will be shown on Friday nights. \nThe show revolves around three singletons hidden from the view of a member of the opposite sex who chooses them based on their answers – rather than their appearance. Cilla Black quit Blind Date in 2003 \nThe couple then pick an envelope revealing the destination of their date. \nThe show was cancelled in 2003 after Cilla quit the show. \nThe new version will be up against ITV’s Take Me Out and Meet The Parents.
