They noted that Sessions, in his previous job as a conservative senator for Alabama, played a significant role in blocking the passage of bipartisan sentencing reform legislation proposed in 2015.\nTrump vows law and order crackdown to combat 'menace' of crime Read more \nThe report suggested that Sessions might view the proposals differently as attorney general given that more than 25% of his justice department’s budget will be spent on funding federal prisons.\n“The more dollars these prisons require, the less available to allocate to federal law enforcement in our fight to secure public safety,” the report said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T19:22:36.438+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
