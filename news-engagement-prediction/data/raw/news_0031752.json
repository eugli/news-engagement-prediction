The young price was an instant internet sensation with pictures of his angelic cherub face flooding fan pages. Apart from that, his name ‘Taimur’ created quite a stir and grabbed headlines after many linked it to a former Mongol conqueror. While Saif along with many family members, friends and fans hit back at haters, Kareena chose to keep mum on the same. However, when probed about the controversy by a daily, the new mummy expressed her shock saying that she though the incident was “bizarre”. Kareena also admitted that she had no idea why people took her son’s name so personally, and also went on to say that it had “no resemblance to any person living or dead”. Like Saif, the actress also insisted that it was the meaning behind the name – Taimur in Arabic means Iron - that made them fall in love with it. Thanking friends and family who let them their support, the star said that it was their support that mattered more than the bad things that were said or written. On the work front, Kareena will be seen alongside Sonam Kapoor in 'Veere Di Wedding', while hubby Saif will soon be promoting his film ‘Rangoon’ alongside Kangana Ranaut and Shahid Kapoor.
