More specifically, Huawei’s executive Bruce Lee confirmed that O2, Vodafone, EE, and Three will all start selling the phone in the near future. As an added extra for those not wanting to be tied into a contract, the unlocked version of the device will also be available for purchase from Carphone Warehouse. While the P10 will be available on all four networks in the UK, the availability of the larger P10 Plus has yet to be confirmed as Lee simply stated that there will be “some surprises” when the model finally launches in the UK. \nThe fact that Huawei reached deals with all four wireless carriers in the UK and Carphone Warehouse shows how serious the company is about further driving its global sales. Last year, the tech giant managed to sell over 10 million units of the Huawei P9 and the P9 Plus, so it remains to be seen if the company can improve upon that figure. Nonetheless, Huawei’s 2017 flagships both represent more of an incremental update over last year’s models. They both offer a more refined design and improvements in terms of hardware, so it shouldn’t be hard to reach similar sales figures considering how well last year’s devices were received. \nHowever, given the recent announcement of the LG G6 flagship, the Chinese company does face tough competition from the very beginning. On the other hand, both companies stand to benefit from the fact that the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus are not expected to be released until mid-April. In any case, Huawei is likely currently in the process of preparing a large-scale marketing campaign to help promote the upcoming P10 and the P10 Plus. It remains to be seen how well the company will do on the market this spring seeing how there’s no shortage of high-end Android devices that are just around the corner, so whatever happens, the global flagship market will likely get even more competitive in the coming months.
