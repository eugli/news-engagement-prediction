The central bank in its sixth bi-monthly policy review on Wednesday cited global uncertainty, rising commodity prices and a strong resurgence of demand in FY18 as the reasons for keeping rates on hold. \n\nThe six-member Monetary Policy Committed chaired by RBI governor Urjit Patel voted unanimously to keep the repo rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent and reverse repo rate at 5.75 per cent. \n\n\"The decision of the MPC is consistent with a neutral stance of monetary policy in consonance with the objective of achieving consumer price index (CPI) inflation at 5 per cent by Q4 of 2016-17 and the medium-term target of 4 per cent,\" the statement said. \n\nThe Committee is of the view that the persistence of inflation excluding food and fuel could set a floor on further downward movements in headline inflation and trigger second-order effects, although consumer price inflation was expected to be contained at 5% in FY17. \n\nRBI said that growth for 2016-17 is projected at 6.9 per cent. Growth is expected to recover sharply in 2017-18 on account of three factors- discretionary consumer demand which was held back by demonetisation is expected to come back; economic activity in cash-intensive sectors such as retail trade, hotels and restaurants, and transportation, as well as in the unorganised sector, is expected to be rapidly restored. Also, demonetisation-induced ease in bank funding conditions has led to drop in interest rates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T21:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T11:28:50.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
