Ramapo got the ball inbounds to Josh Ford , who found Bonacum cutting down the center of the floor. \n“Me and my teammate Chris Moseley , every day after practice, we practice those shots,” Bonacum told the Asbury Park Press . “People think it’s a joke, but you never know when that situation is going to happen. Some days you make them (in practice), some days you don’t even hit the rim. Chris is probably better at them than I am.” \nAs you can tell from the video, Bonacum took a spill after he got the shot off and never saw it go in. He certainly heard the reaction, though. \n“It felt good distance-wise but I fell on my side; for all I knew it could have missed the backboard,” Bonacum told the paper. “I heard the crowd go crazy and a kid on their team tripped over me, so I didn’t see any of it. Then I just got mobbed on the court. It was a pretty scary experience. Next thing I knew, the whole team was on top of me.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T05:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:48:00.869+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
