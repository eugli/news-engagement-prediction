Advertisement \nIt’s going to be a wet and raw Tuesday morning, with temperatures forecasted to be in the 30s around 11 a.m., when the parade starts. Early morning snow in some regions is expected to switch over to rain later in the day. \n“Expect puddles and delays on the roads,” writes Boston.com’s David Epstein . “Folks who want to come to the parade tomorrow should allow themselves extra time to get into the city for both traffic and weather reasons.” \nIn Monday’s press conference, Walsh asked people to dress appropriately for the weather and to wear waterproof clothing, if possible. \nRead Epstein’s full forecast here . Fortunately for the team, they’ll be riding in amphibious vehicles \nAs in previous years, the Patriots will be hauled around by Boston Duck Boats. \n— Boston Duck Tours (@BostonDuckTours) February 6, 2017 \nSince 2002, the company has been centrally involved in victory parades for the Patriots, Red Sox, Celtics, and Bruins. And they do it for free. \n“We eat the costs, but it pays off in marketing [to have so many eyes on the boats],” Boston Duck Tours CEO Cindy Brown told Boston.com in 2015 . How many people are expected to attend? \nIn Monday’s press conference, Walsh said that, based off previous parades, the city expects 500,000 to 1 million people to attend. \nThe mayor added that the “dramatic fashion” in which Sunday’s game ended may result in an increase in attendance Tuesday. But the inclement weather could just as well temper the crowds. 3 other things to know if you’re attending the parade: Take public transportation Officials strongly encouraged parade-goers not to drive into the city, given the number of people expected to attend, as well as the messy weather. It’s a family friendly event Evans said Monday there will be “zero tolerance” for public drinking and Walsh reminded residents that even though the state recently legalized marijuana, smoking it in public is prohibited. Don’t be one of those people climbing on things Officials say there have been accidents in the past with people climbing on statues, flagpoles, electrical boxes, and other structures during championship parades (as people often seem to do). “ We want to discourage that type of behavior,” Evans said. How to follow the parade if you’re not attending: \nThe parade is expected to be televised on local broadcast networks, as well as the NFL Network. For those without access to TV (or at work) Tuesday, the NFL Network will also live stream the festivities. Advertisement \nSo get ready Patriots fans.
