I’d gone into a bar to get some lunch. I was on my own, looking at a newspaper, and I saw an article about the Proton Therapy Center. It was the first I’d heard about it. \n“The next day, I walked in off the street and went to visit them. I had an initial consultation that week.” EXPRESS Prostate cancer treatment: Joe has escamped erectile dysfunction following his treatment \nJoe said he eventually had treatment in June 2013 and three years later, his PSA levels have reduced from 7.2 to 0.5. \nHe said: “You go for proton beam therapy, and you’re out in a few minutes. In my mind, there was nothing to be afraid of. We’re petitioning GPs and urologists to make them more aware of what proton therapy has to offer, so that they can then pass on that knowledge to their patients. \n“I want to show people that it works. I’m not trying to persuade anyone, I just want to share my experience.” \nDr Jiri Kubes, specialist in prostate carcinoma and medical director at the Proton Therapy Center in Prague, said: “The most important thing for Joe was preserving his vitality after treatment. EXPRESS Prostate cancer: Joe has set up a group to share his experience \n“Men like Joe can make this a reality with proton therapy – an option that offers a high success rate as well as a low risk of side effects – and therefore a greater chance of preserving full quality of life after the conclusion of treatment. \n“Erectile dysfunction is probably the biggest problem of standard surgery and of photon radiotherapy as well - almost 40 per cent of the patients suffer from problems with erection after those treatments. \n“But when using proton radiation as the only treatment, the sexual functions are preserved for almost all of our patients.” \nAround 42,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year in the UK. \nA staggering one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer at some point in their lifetime.
