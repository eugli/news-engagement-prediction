Email us at Update: slight delay on gates open - we hope to have you inside soon. Thanks for your patience. #GnFnR â€” Westpac Stadium (@WestpacStadium) February 2, 2017 \nOthers said they had been told the turnstiles were not working. \nA security guard said on Thursday evening that crews were still preparing the stage, and their work had been delayed by the rain. \nThe gates to the show were supposed to open at 5pm, but it took more than 90 minutes before they finally opened, and the queues begain moving. BRAD FLAHIVE/ FAIRFAX NZ \nRobert Lloyd, of Petone, was planning to head to the pub, rather than waiting in line for the gates to open. \nSupport band Wolfmother were scheduled to start playing at 6.45pm, but the stadium was still largely empty. \nAngela Gillies-O'Flaherty wrote on the stadium's Facebook page: \"It's now been over an hour standing in the rain and you still haven't opened the gates. This is such poor event management. \n\"No doubt there is a health and safety risk with this many people - everyone - standing here.\" \nBrendon Gutschlag said: \"Sort your technical difficulties out. It rains a lot in Wellington and if your system can't handle it that it is poor performance from your team. Ad Feedback \n\"And a bit more information would be appreciated - one hour standing in the rain is not cool.\" \nRobert Lloyd, of Petone, said he would be meeting his mates at the pub, rather than standing in line outside the gates. \n\"I'll be going hard once I'm in there.\" - Stuff ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T12:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:49:09.401+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
