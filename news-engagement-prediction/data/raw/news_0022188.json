I am 55 yrs, and if I don’t learn to speak the truth now, at what point in life will I be honest in my ways,” she told sit-in host Kwaku Owusu Adjei on Anopa Kasapa on Kasapa 102.5 FM Wednesday. The Minister was met with some challenges in her vetting and subsequent approval by parliament, but the former claimed that the problems will spur her on so she’ll be forthright in her office as a Minister in the interest of the state. “Life without challenges is no life. I thank God they have approved my appointment. The Ministry I’ll be handling, there are many opportunities for me to assist in solving our social and cultural problems prevailing in our society, and I won’t relent to give off my best and work hard in that Ministry. Madam Otiko Djaba was approved by parliament amidst controversy over her confirmation by the House. She, however, was approved with 152 votes on the floor during balloting on Tuesday, despite the Minority boycott of the process. She was part of the second batch of Ministers, sworn in Tuesday at the Flagstaff House by the President.
