Kerr , a George Washington University law professor who specializes in Fourth Amendment and technology issues, said Judge Gorsuch’s opinions suggested that he was “not a knee-jerk vote for the government.” That is important, Mr. Kerr said, because the Supreme Court has yet to resolve many questions about how the Fourth Amendment applies to 21st-century communications. \nAdvertisement   “The history of the Fourth Amendment is about physically breaking into houses and taking away papers, and the big question is how do you apply that physical concept to a virtual world,” Mr. Kerr said. “Courts are struggling with that, and there is a lot of wiggle room in how to do it.” Underscoring how ambiguous constitutional law remains in this area, the Intercept website this week published a leaked version of an F.B.I. operational guide that revealed internal rules for emerging investigative technologies that raise Fourth Amendment issues. For example, the guide tells agents not to introduce in court evidence derived from using so-called Stingray devices to locate cellphones’ owners, adding that their use to find people inside buildings “could be deemed to constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.” Video Trump Selects Gorsuch for Supreme Court Judge Neil M.

Watch in Times Video » embed “There is, however, currently no specific decision on point,” it said. Since President George W. Bush appointed Judge Gorsuch to the 10th Circuit in 2006, the judge has dealt with several Fourth Amendment cases that raised novel technology issues. A 2013 case, for example, raised the question of what should happen if police officers erroneously stopped someone because of faulty technology, then discovered evidence of a crime. In that case, an officer stopped a car because a license plate database, which was known to be unreliable, erroneously indicated that its plate was invalid. The officer then found drugs in the car. Writing for a unanimous panel, Judge Gorsuch suggested that the officer’s use of the flawed technology made the search sufficiently unlawful to block prosecutors from using the drugs as evidence. Still, Judge Gorsuch has also sided with the government in cases involving new technologies. One arose in response to a 2012 Supreme Court ruling that police officers need a warrant to monitor a suspect’s movements by attaching GPS trackers to his car. The case before Judge Gorsuch presented the question of whether prosecutors could use evidence the police had gathered with such a GPS tracker in 2011, before the Supreme Court handed down its ruling. In that case, Judge Gorsuch, again writing for a unanimous panel , held that prosecutors could use the evidence because the warrant rule for GPS trackers had not been clear at the time.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T03:50:23.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
