(Photo: Getty Images) \nIf you were watching the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game on Friday night, you saw a young fan make his way on the court and score a basket late in the fourth quarter in what was the greatest moment of the game. \nThat young fan with the big personality is named Jarrius \"J.J.\" Robertson, and he has been very involved in the happenings of All-Star weekend in New Orleans. \nWe're here to explain to you who he is and why he's there stealing the show. — NBA (@NBA) February 18, 2017 Who is Jarrius Robertson? \nJarrius is a 14-year-old battling a chronic liver disease called biliary atresia. As explained in his bio on the website of his foundation called \"It takes lives to save lives,\" he has been through many surgeries. And when he was just 1 years old, he had a liver transplant that resulted in complications that left him in a coma for \"close to a year.\" \nThings weren't looking good, but then a miracle happened. Per Jarrius' site: \nThe respirator was taken away. But JJ was not ready to stop fighting. He started to breathe on his own. Doctors couldn't really offer much of an explanation. JJ's mom came up with her own: \"It was a miracle - nothing but God.\" \nNow, at 14 years old, Jarrius, whose growth is affected by the disease, inspires many with his upbeat attitude and his hilarious personality. \nJarrius is awaiting another liver transplant. You can donate to help with his medical bills at his GoFundMe page . Why is Jarrius at NBA All-Star weekend? \nJarrius is known around New Orleans for being a Saints superfan. He's good friends with the Saints , has done videos for them and they once even had him sign a contract to become an honorary Saint . \nIt's no surprise that he was also invited to participate in the NBA All-Star weekend festivities in New Orleans. He puts a lot of smiles on many, many faces everywhere he goes.

He told Russell Westbrook the Thunder need more shooters to make the playoffs. Great moment from today's availability between Westbrook and @Jarrius .
