I hope all of your top picks won and that you ate many snacks in their honor. Let’s start the week with some television news catch-up, shall we? Today’s TV-Cap has a new teaser for Doctor Who that focuses on the new companion Bill, some posters for the Twin Peaks revival, a closer look at The Handmaid’s Tale , and more. \nA Progression.

The above teaser is all about her and what she thinks of the ups and downs that come with her new traveling buddy. [ Nerdist ] \nMobile Game Comeback. Miss Futurama ? Then you’ll be happy to hear JamCity is going to be releasing a Futurama mobile game in 2017 with the original voice cast and writers from the show. Learn more here at Nerdist . \nA Real Four-Parter. In the 2016 DCTV mega crossover, Supergirl didn’t get to participate. The event kicked off in the last few seconds of Supergirl but didn’t really swing into action until The Flash . That won’t be the case in 2017. Series executive producer Andrew Kreisberg recently said, “We’re hoping to do a true four-way crossover.” He explained knowing the shows are coming back next year means they can build in proper scheduling: “One of the big things we learned from two years ago, which made the crossovers slightly easier this year, was built-in shutdown days, where shows just went dark, because the single hardest factor in doing the crossovers is actors’ availability” while the four series simultaneously continue production.” Read more at TVLine . \nHi, Agent Cooper! February 24 is an auspicious day: it’s Twin Peaks Day! The holiday marks the first time Agent Dale Cooper entered the town of Twin Peaks. To celebrate, Showtime released two posters for the revival (premiering May 21). They feature an older Agent Dale Cooper and Laura Palmer with the tagline, “It is happening again.” What do you make of it? Tell me your theories in the comments. [ IGN , Images: Showtime] \nNetflix Special. May 16 will bring another new comedy special to Netflix, this one from Tracy Morgan . It’s called Staying Alive and will feature Morgan discussing his new lease on life since the accident he suffered in 2014. [ The Hollywood Reporter ] \nCosplay Battle. Syfy is launching a new competition series on March 21, and it’s all about cosplay. Cosplay Melee will be hosted by Yvette Nicole Brown, and you can see some exclusive art for the series featuring Brown right this way . \nAnalyzing Bebop. If you’re a fan of Cowboy Bebop , you’re likely to appreciate the above analysis and essay by Channel Criswell. It looks at the anime with a critical eye and digs into the heart of the show. [ Nerdist ] \nDaggit. The Battlestar Galactica reboot from the early 2000s didn’t bring everything from the classic series over. Muffit the Daggit was left behind. The creature was performed by a chimpanzee. What. If your curiosity is piqued, hop to this post at Nerdist to learn more about Muffit. \nHaving Hope. A dystopian world doesn’t seem like an impossibility at the moment, which means Hulu’s The Handmaid’s Tale has chilling timing. The 10-episode first season will arrive on April 26, and if you’re not sure about the drama adapted from the novel by Margaret Atwood, the above featurette gives you a glimpse of the characters, the world, and the tone. \nCasting Updates. I have two casting notes for you today. First of all, Lea Michele has signed on for the ABC comedy pilot from Daveed Diggs ( Hamilton ). The series is known as the untitled City Mayor for now, and we don’t know who Michele is playing yet. Then, for the Black Lightning pilot, The CW has found the man for its title role of Jefferson Pierce/Black Lightning. He’ll be played by Cress Williams ( Hart of Dixie ).
