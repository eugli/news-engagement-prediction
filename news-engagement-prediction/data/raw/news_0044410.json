Afridi had been a fan favourite since he burst onto the scene in 1996, striking a 37-ball century against Sri Lanka in only his second match to set a world record that was unbeaten for 17 years.\nHe became known as a bowling all-rounder in the second half of his career and was instrumental in Pakistan's early successes in Twenty20, including their 2009 victory.\nAfridi finishes his international career having played just 27 Test matches which yielded 1,176 runs with a highest score of 156 and 48 wickets. He played 398 one-day internationals with 8,064 runs, a highest score of 124 while taking 395 wickets with his leg spin. His Twenty20 international career saw him play 98 matches with 1,405 runs and 97 wickets.", "external_links": ["http://dc-cdn.s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/dc-Cover-07dvu98u736g6b4fqqibrsujk2-20160327173918.Medi.jpeg"], "published": "2017-02-20T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:55:44.937+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
