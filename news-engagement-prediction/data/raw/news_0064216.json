But no one spoke against it on Wednesday.\nThe district made several changes after complaints from residents of the Casa Bella neighborhood west of Delray Beach , who did not want their children to leave Calusa. The district allowed them to stay and to also have priority at Morikami Park Elementary School, an International Baccalaureate magnet school close to their homes.\nThe plan moves 332 students to new schools next year: 165 Calusa students would move to J.C. Mitchell and Whispering Pines elementary schools, while 67 Whispering Pines students would head to Sunrise Park Elementary and 100 J.C. Mitchell students would transfer to Addison Mizner and Boca Raton elementary schools.\nAll the schools have room for more students, but Calusa would remain overcrowded, at 102 percent of its capacity next year.\nDespite the attendance zone change, school district projections show Calusa, which has 1,237 students now, will remain crowded in the coming years, with 1,106 students in 2019, or 107 percent of capacity.\nMembers of the Advisory Boundary Committee, which makes attendance zone recommendations to the School Board, said at least 400 students needed to leave Calusa to avoid another boundary change in the next few years.\n \n \nLsolomon@sunsentinel.com \nCopyright Â© 2017, Sun Sentinel Elementary Schools Boca Raton Delray Beach", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:52:19.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
