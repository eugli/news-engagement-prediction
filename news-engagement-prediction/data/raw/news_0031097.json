Free regular bus services were running between Woodlands and Yishun stations in both directions, it added.\nAt 8.26am, SMRT said train services had resumed, although trains were travelling slower due to the earlier fault. Free bus services ceased about 20 minutes after that.\n[NSL] UPDATE: Train svc resumed. Free reg bus is still available. Trains are travelling at a slower speed due to an earlier train fault.\n— SMRT Corporation (@SMRT_Singapore) February 13, 2017 \nIrate commuters took to social media to complain about the delay. \nSMRT AT ITS BEST. pic.twitter.com/NcyPz3Keye \n— Hidayat.

Good start to Monday blues. #smrt #trainfault pic.twitter.com/TBMkJbcMIb \n— Sidney (@swgj86) February 13, 2017 \nMonday’s train fault came after several delays last week. Last Friday, commuters were told to factor in additional travelling time on the East-West and North-South Lines during the morning rush hour. Another track fault also occurred on the East-West Line on Sunday.\n- CNA/xk\nEmail More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T16:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T03:22:23.123+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
