I believe the last governor refused to go ahead with it. There is no space in the Modi government for the ones who disagree,” Gandhi added. \nOn the Congress’ pre-poll alliance with the ruling Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi said it was aimed at creating “a younger alternative for UP and provide a vision to the state”. \n“The way we have designed it, they (the SP) are suggesting a few things, we are suggesting a few things and we have a broad framework within which we are going to operate. On the personal side, it’s great, there is no problem at all. There is a lot of common ground. Akhilesh (Yadav) has good intentions and he has an open mind,” Gandhi said. \nAssembly polls in the state are being held in seven phases and voting will end on March 8. \nRead |UP elections: Why a hung assembly can’t be ruled out in this battleground state \nOn a question on the importance of assembly polls for national politics, Gandhi said they will provide the people’s answer to the way the country is being run by the BJP-led government. \n“I think the BJP is trying to impose a particular ideology on the country. They are trying to do it by capturing national institutions and filling these with people who believe in their ideology. Their policies are resulting in quite a lot of discontent. That is what is building the opposition to the BJP. Generally, poorer people, those belonging to weaker sections, are feeling the pain and they are building up the resistance to the BJP,” he added. \nHe also denied suggestions that the Opposition has failed to counter the Modi government. \n“There is no failure on the part of the Opposition. We are going to win the next election. What I am pointing to is Modi’s inability to carry anybody with him. To his way of decision-making, his unilateral way of operating, not even taking senior members of his Cabinet along — they don’t feel part of a team. One man can’t run this country.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T21:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:43.138+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
