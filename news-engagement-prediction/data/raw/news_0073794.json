Whether you’ve just been diagnosed or fear a recurrence, breast cancer survivor Darryle Pollack’s story will inspire and inform you... Darryle Pollack had just relocated to Carmel, Calif., from Los Angeles in 1995, when she discovered a large lump in her right breast while showering. Her annual mammogram eight months earlier had shown nothing amiss. Now she faced advanced cancer with multiple breast tumors, a mastectomy and a 60% chance she’d be alive – but not cancer-free – in 10 years. “I was in a total panic,” says Pollack, an artist and co-founder of the WHOA!Network (Women Honoring Our Age). “I felt the cancer must be growing like crazy. It was too big for a lumpectomy. I was convinced this was a dire situation.” Although not immediately life-threatening, it was serious enough for four surgeries and seemingly endless chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Pollack now is a cancer survivor, one of nearly 14.5 million in the U.S. as of June 2014, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). Nearly 70% of people diagnosed with cancer today will be alive in five years, according to the National Cancer Institute. A decade ago, the survival rate was 66%.

Surviving cancer means different things to different patients. In general, it includes getting treatment, handling treatment side effects, facing a possible cancer recurrence and managing relationships with family, friends and caregivers, according to the ACS. For Pollack, it meant making it to her children’s high school graduations at least six years down the line. In an exclusive Lifescript interview, Pollack shares her roller-coaster ride to surviving cancer, from diagnosis to life after treatment. Fasten your seat belt. What was your reaction to your diagnosis? My mother had died young of cancer – melanoma – so in a weird way, I expected this. But I wasn’t expecting breast cancer. I was panicked and felt unraveled. I had two young kids then. In my head, I went right from diagnosis to death. What type and stage was your cancer? I had almost every kind of breast cancer you could get: multifocal [breast-wide], little tumors and big tumors. My doctor said he’d never seen so many kinds in one breast. The rate of growth wasn’t too aggressive, but the number of breast cancers I had was alarming. And it was close to my chest wall, making it harder to get it all surgically. S urviving cancer takes grit, perseverance and lots of support. Whether you’ve just been diagnosed or fear a recurrence, breast cancer survivor Darryle Pollack’s story will inspire and inform you... My cancer was stage 3. Four lymph nodes were positive for cancer. The doctor removed 20 of them. [There are about 45 underarm lymph nodes and 10-20 usually are removed if the cancer has spread there, according to Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C.]. I made the doctor explain my prognosis in detail. Based on what he told me, I thought I’d be dead in five years. [ Editor’s note : Stage 3 breast cancer means it hasn’t spread to distant sites. But the tumors are fairly large and often have spread to lymph nodes, according to the Mayo Clinic.] What kind of mindset did you adopt to be a breast cancer survivor? I took charge. It felt like a life-and-death situation. I was relentless and pushy trying to find a top surgeon for my mastectomy. I tracked down surgeon Armando Giuliano, MD, who pioneered sentinel lymph node biopsy [which removes the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor]. He did the mastectomy. Biopsy to surgery took about 10 days, not the usual 30. Did you have a double mastectomy? I had a single mastectomy. I didn’t think about reconstruction either. I just wanted this breast off.

What was your post-surgery period like? I endured a couple weeks with surgical drains [which prevent the buildup of lymphatic fluid and blood under the arm]. It was grueling. My shoulder locked in place; it was painful under my arm; and I couldn’t reach, which is still a problem.I took heavy-duty anti-nausea medication for the first chemotherapy drugs. But I was so weak I couldn’t get out of bed or drive the kids to school. I kept losing weight. I lived on one protein shake a day. How did you feel about your body after the mastectomy? I was very self-conscious; my posture got bad from hunching. I wanted to take the spotlight off of my chest.I was preoccupied because the doctor had removed my underarm lymph nodes. At that time, 1-3 affected nodes was considered more treatable; 4-10 was “bad.” During treatment, what did it mean to be surviving cancer? It meant I had to make lots of hard decisions. My choices included doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) chemotherapy for high-risk patients and a stem-cell transplant [which helps replace the source of blood cells after treatment destroys the marrow and stem cells].I [chose the treatment that] included four rounds of heavy doxorubicin, then a three-drug combination.

What other treatment and surgeries did you have? After the first chemotherapy treatment, I decided to have my ovaries removed to avoid ovarian cancer. It felt proactive. I was told not to undergo that surgery during chemotherapy. But I thought that the advantage of preventing ovarian cancer outweighed the risk of interrupting my chemotherapy. Two or three weeks after finishing chemotherapy, I began radiation. I had daily treatments for six weeks. After resting a week or two after radiation, I underwent eight treatments of a milder chemotherapy. A year after the diagnosis, I had my other breast removed. It was elective. I also had reconstruction at that surgery, for both breasts. The tissue expanders they used to accommodate the implants caused terrible pain. My body rejected the implants and I had to have them removed six months later. Today, I use nothing. I stopped wearing prosthetic breasts after I lost one at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. I’m done with all of that. [ Editor’s note : Tissue expanders are implantable devices that stretch breast skin and chest wall muscles to hold a permanent breast implant later.] Was it emotionally difficult to opt for a mastectomy? My husband didn’t make it an issue – he made me feel beautiful. I was focused on my deep depression. I was so terrified my children would lose me. S urviving cancer takes grit, perseverance and lots of support. Whether you’ve just been diagnosed or fear a recurrence, breast cancer survivor Darryle Pollack’s story will inspire and inform you... What was your depression like? [In the beginning, before I had lots of support,] I felt very alone. I didn’t have friends yet where I lived. I tried a local support group, but didn’t care for it. I also had a job where I needed to look good, so everything I was doing was all about feeling and looking good.I was preoccupied with my mom’s history – I worried that my kids would grow up without a mom, like I did. I’d cry at every conversation, TV show and commercial. Did you obsess about surviving cancer? Every thought in my head was about cancer. Everything I did, everyone I saw, I’d think, “You’re lucky, you don’t have cancer.” What did you do to stop obsessing about surviving cancer? I delved into art projects, which allowed me to go an hour without thinking about my illness. It was a great distraction. Did friends and family help you get through this period? Cancer made me assess and change some of my relationships. Some friends were offended because I didn’t call them and personally tell them about my illness. I had no time or tolerance for that. I was focused on my survival. S urviving cancer takes grit, perseverance and lots of support. Whether you’ve just been diagnosed or fear a recurrence, breast cancer survivor Darryle Pollack’s story will inspire and inform you... Did psychotherapy help you? Yes. Early on, I went from being a victim to a fighter. My therapist compared me to a Clydesdale horse – I’m strong and can handle anything. To this day, it’s a helpful image – me pulling a load, not being knocked down.I took antidepressants, which helped. At first I’d felt that I should be strong and tough it out. What else did you do? I wrote three things I was grateful for in a “gratitude journal” every day. I was able to look at people in worse situations than mine and appreciate that my case wasn’t that bad. How long were you depressed? The depression lasted five years. At the beginning I thought I’d never think of anything but cancer. I became relentless about finding other treatments I could do. If it might help, I did it. How did you react to your hair loss? This issue was much bigger than losing my breasts. It was horrifying to see myself bald. I never intentionally let my kids or anyone see me that way. But while vacationing in Hawaii, I was in the ocean with my kids. My hair was about 1/4-inch long, so I still wore a wig. I glued it to my scalp so I could swim.A big wave came and knocked my wig off. I ran out of the water to cover my head with a towel. My daughter, who was about 12, and I burst out laughing. Then she saw the wig in the water and rescued it. It turned into a funny situation, which I learned is helpful. S urviving cancer takes grit, perseverance and lots of support. Whether you’ve just been diagnosed or fear a recurrence, breast cancer survivor Darryle Pollack’s story will inspire and inform you... Do you worry about cancer returning? In the past, if I saw a spot on my body, I thought I had cancer. Every spot was a melanoma. Now, I’m not obsessive about it. I don’t overly worry about it. I’m grateful for the gift of surviving cancer; I wasn’t expected to live. It took a lot of years to get to this point. But eventually I felt more like a cancer survivor than a patient. My treatment was done and my hair grew back. I learned to live in the present. That took 3-4 years. What’s it like to be a breast cancer survivor more than 20 years later? I’m proud of it. When I thought about cancer in the beginning, it was as a stigma; I was embarrassed. I never thought I’d be known as a cancer survivor. It makes you appreciate every day. Women fear getting older and like to skip birthdays. I’m thrilled to be a year older. I’m lucky to be here with my kids and see them as adults. What’s your advice to women dealing with cancer?
