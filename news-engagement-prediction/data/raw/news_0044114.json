And the soap’s boss Iain MacLeod has unveiled plans for a stand alone episode featuring just Aaron’s storyline which will not be too dissimilar to the hugely praised Ashley Thomas-centric episode of late last year. The top 10 shows to watch on Netflix this month \nWith Aaron serving a one year prison sentence, he is destined to cope badly inside with being away from his family and the man he loves, Robert. Given his history, his struggles with mental health and the other prisoners set on making life difficult, Aaron’s time inside is going to be harrowing. \nAnd the episode ahead is bound to be full of drama and emotion as things come to a head. \nIain told Metro.co.uk at a recent Emmerdale event: ‘We’ve got coming up a really special stand alone type of episode which will be a day in the life of Aaron Dingle as a convict. I’ve yet to see it but the scripts were really fantastic and it’s as much a day in the life of that family – what’s it like for Liv losing her older brother/father figure to prison? What’s it like for Robert losing the man he loves? What’s it like for Chas? (Picture: ITV) \n‘We thought we’d do something because it’s quite topical as well in that there’s a lot of news issues around prison and prison life and the kind of challenges people face in prison so we just thought it was a really good opportunity to explore some of that using a really well liked group of characters. That’s coming up in the not too distant future.’ \nDiscussing Aaron’s story as a whole, Iain continued: ‘The story for a while will feature Aaron in jail quite heavily. What we didn’t want to do, and what sometimes happens in a soap, is to put a popular character behind bars and then you never see them. We just thought we shouldn’t shy away from what it’s like – obviously Aaron’s experiences with jail are numerous and complicated and we’ll be touching upon the fact that Gordon took his own life in jail and that has its own, hopefully quite surprising effect, on how Aaron is able to cope in there.’ (Picture: ITV) When asked whether other inmates would link Aaron to Gordon or find out that he is Gordon’s son, Iain added: ‘I couldn’t possibly comment but you may not be far wrong in guessing that. The story becomes a case of can he escape his past and can he get over his past? What impact does the struggle he has inside have on his family on the outside?\n‘And to what degree does he feel able to be honest with them about what he’s going through because Robert, Liv and everyone is worried sick about him. However bad it gets in there, is it the right thing to share it with them? It’s only going to make it worse for them in terms of their level of anxiety. It’s big and complicated and interesting and feels quite topical. With every news report that comes out, I feel pleased that we’re tackling this.’ All the press event gossip! \nIn case you missed any, here are links to all of the articles from the Emmerdale press event. \nFirst details of Chas’ exit revealed ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T13:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T04:40:04.532+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
