Â© Reuters \nTOKYO -- Toshiba on Tuesday said that a 712.5 billion yen ($6.3 billion) impairment charge on its nuclear operations will lead to a 499.9 billion yen net loss for the nine months through December. \nThe company also downgraded its earnings projection for the full year through March to a 390 billion yen loss, from the previous estimate of a 145 billion yen profit. \nThe numbers are not officially audited earnings; the company postponed the official announcement earlier in the day. \nToshiba also announced the resignation of Chairman Shigenori Shiga, effective on Wednesday. \nThe impairment loss came from a U.S. nuclear plant construction company, which Toshiba subsidiary Westinghouse Electric acquired in 2015. The company earlier explained that the labor and material costs for planned U.S. plant projects will be higher than expected, resulting in a downgrade of its entire nuclear business value. \nAs a result, shareholders' equity stood at negative 191.2 billion yen as of the end of December. \nTo avoid insolvency at the end of this fiscal year, Toshiba needs to repay debts by selling assets, or add equity through financing or turning a profit by the end of March. It has already decided to spin off its core chip business and said today it is considering selling a majority stake, for which multiple potential investors have made offers. \nPresident Satoshi Tsunakawa is to provide details in a news conference at 6:30 p.m. at the company's Tokyo headquarters. \nQ&A on Toshiba's financial predicament \nQ: What is the cause of the loss? \nA: The loss stems from a U.S. nuclear construction company which Toshiba's subsidiary Westinghouse Electric acquired in 2015 and has four plant construction projects. Toshiba found it had underestimated labor and material costs for the projects at the time of acquisition. As a result, Toshiba downgraded goodwill of its nuclear business, totaling a 712.5 billion yen. \nQ: How significant is the loss? \nA: The impairment loss severely dented Toshiba shareholders' equity, which fell to negative 191.2 billion yen at the end of December. Negative shareholder equity means its assets cannot cover debt. If Toshiba remains insolvent at the end of this fiscal year on Mar. 31, the company will likely face difficulties in securing financing from lenders and investors. \nQ: How can Toshiba avoid insolvency? \nA: One of the ongoing measures is the partial sale of its profitable chip business. This would provide billions of yen to reduce debt. Toshiba also expects profit for the January-March quarter, which will contribute to offsetting the negative shareholder equity. \nQ: Can Toshiba maintain its listing? \nA: Under the Tokyo Stock Exchange's criteria, if liabilities exceed assets for a year, the stock could be delisted. On top of this, Toshiba has already been designated a \"Stock on Alert\" for accounting irregularities. Failing to demonstrate an improvement in internal management practices to the bourse could provide another reason for delisting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:13:52.196+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
