Brunswick Mill studios \nThe store was set up by Sonny Fox and Marc Greaves last year. It is part of the community studios venue at Brunswick Mill, which offers musicians a place to practise, perform, record, get their instruments repaired and hire equipment. \nOn Friday night, raiders smashed a window and took three guitars and cash. A rare Gibson EB bass guitar was taken, as well as two Japanese Fender Telecasters. \nOn Saturday night, a second break-in saw another 20-plus guitars taken. Thugs broke metal bars on a window to get in. It is believed at least 25 instruments, ranging from £500 to well over £1,000 apiece, were taken. Window where raiders broke in \nMost belonged to musicians who use Brunswick Mill Studios and customers of the shop. Some had insurance, but many didn’t. \nSome of the instruments are too rare to replace or have huge sentimental value. \nSonny said: “We’re mortified. I’m hoping for some sort of miracle or that someone crosses paths with some of these instruments. Some of them are pretty distinct guitars.” Window grate the burglars removed to get into the building \nIt is thought those who broke in had been in the studios and shop before as they managed to dodge CCTV cameras. \nBrunswick Mill Studios boss Mike Rickard said: “Sonny and Marc are gutted, they’re talking about having to close down. \n“They only set up in November. Setting up the studios has been about building up a real community of musicians. It’s a horrible thing to happen. Some of these guitars are very old and rare. We’re just hoping people will spot them if people are trying to sell them and call the police.” \nA spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police said the burglaries are being investigated. Users and staff at Brunswick Mill studios \nAnyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111. \nA fund has been set up to help Sonny and Marc and those whose guitars were taken. \nTo contribute, visit: http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/robbery-at-the-monkey-house-music-shop", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:00:56.806+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
