In a new interview with Variety, the host revealed that when his contract with the network expires in the fall of 2019, he’s seriously considering moving on to a different career path. “I know I will do the show for another three years,” Kimmel explained . “It’s possible that will be it. My wife’s pregnant. At a certain point, I’d like to have a little more free time. I have very little free time as it is.” As the executive producer of Live!, Kimmel often works 70-plus hours every week for the show. “I think this job is a grind, and best-cast scenario, a marathon,” he continued. “I want to go out on my own terms. If I ever feel like we’re repeating ourselves, I think it’s a good indication that it’s time. I will miss it when I go. Television is changing quickly. I get a lot of offers to do a lot of different things.”\nKimmel also indicated that if he were to indeed permanently sign off Live!, it wouldn’t be for another late-night venture. “If there’s something that excites me creatively, it doesn’t necessarily mean something in show business,” he said. “I like to draw. I like to make sculptures. I’d like to write a book at some point. Doing the show every day doesn’t leave a lot of time for that.” Someone break the news to Guillermo nicely.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:58:42.221+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
