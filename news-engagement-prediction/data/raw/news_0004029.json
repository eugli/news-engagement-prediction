remain in the UK after Brexit as the next battlegrounds over our EU divorce emerges\nTheresa May faces a Tory rebellion over demands to let three million EU citizens remain in the UK after Brexit as the next battlegrounds over Britain's EU divorce emerge.\nMPs overwhelmingly backed legislation to trigger Article 50 last night but the bill now faces a series of votes on individual aspects of Brexit.\nMinisters will today publish their White Paper that sets out its strategy for Brexit negotiations, while MPs have already tabled hundreds of amendments that threaten to tie the Prime Minister's hands during divorce talks.\nDowning Street has been warned that at least half a dozen Tory MPs will join opposition MPs in demanding Mrs May offer a legal guarantee to the 3.3million EU nationals currently living in the UK will be able to stay.\nThe demand is one of a host of amendments MPs will debate and vote on in the next phase of the Brexit bill next week and a series of Tories are said to be 'very unhappy' that assurances have yet to be made.\nBut the Prime Minister is reluctant to give guarantees before the status of 900,00 Britons currently living on the continent are assured.\nBrexit Secretary David Davis told a private meeting of Tories that 'only a couple' of countries were blocking an early deal on guaranteeing EU citizens in Britain and British expats on the continent the right to remain.\nAnd in the White Paper published today the Government takes a public swipe at the EU member states who are preventing a deal.\nSpeaking in the Commons today, Mr Davis promised to 'redouble' his efforts to 'rapidly' secure a deal with European leaders on the issue.\nHe said it is 'one of the Government's early priorities for the forthcoming negotiations,' the official document states.\nMPs have already tabled hundreds of amendments for the next phase of the Brexit bill next week that threaten to tie the Prime Minister's hands during divorce talks. Pictured, Theresa May at the Despatch Box as she takes on Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs\nThe government defeated the wrecking amendment by 336 votes to 100 in the Commons, and won the key second reading vote by 498 votes to 114\nToday's White Paper document largely replicates Mrs May's 12-point blueprint for Brexit, which she announced in her keynote speech on the EU last month.\nIt puts regaining control of immigration at the heart of its plan.\nIt also makes clear that Britain will leave the single market, leave at least some of the customs union and end the jurisdiction of European judges over British law.\nBut there are few further details in today's document. The lack of a 100 per cent guarantee on protecting the rights of EU nationals currently in the UK risks sparking trouble with Tory MPs.\nThe White Paper states: 'The Government would have liked to resolve this issue ahead of the formal negotiations. And although many EU Member States favour such an agreement, this has not proven possible.\n'The UK remains ready to give people the certainty they want and reach a reciprocal deal with our European partners at the earliest opportunity. It is the right and fair thing to do.'\nAlberto Costa, pictured, MP for South Leicestershire, whose Italian parents live in Britain, is leading the Tory rebellion demanding a guaranteed deal for EU citizens\nTory MP Nigel Evans said the EU countries blocking an early deal on the issue were guilty of 'a form of mental torture' for the 3.3million Europeans uncertain about their future in the UK.\nOne Tory MP threatening to rebel on the issue told The Times: 'No 10 should be scared. There are easily more than half a dozen who could vote against the government and lots more abstentions.'\nAlberto Costa, MP for South Leicestershire, whose Italian parents live in Britain, is leading the Tory rebellion demanding a guaranteed deal for EU citizens.\nHe was one of a dozen Conservative MPs who raised concerns over EU nationals in the Commons Brexit debate over the last couple of days.\nMr Costa told the Government that when'I and other members of this House voted, rightly, to give the British people the ultimate say in this matter, we did not vote to take away the rights of EU citizens like my parents who live in this country. It is disgraceful that, as it stands today, we are not honouring their rights.'\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd, who campaigned for Remain, has been charged with trying to kill the rebellion by phoning around Tory MPs who signalled they could rebel after the White Paper is published today.\nLast night the Commons endorsed the Article 50 bill by 498 votes to 114 after the government saw off a desperate bid by more than 100 Remoaners to block it.\nOne Labour MP yelled 'suicide' as the result was read out in the chamber.\nMinutes before the vote, Dawn Butler and Rachael Maskell dramatically quit the frontbench to defy Jeremy Corbyn and vote against the key legislation, adding two more vacancies to his top team after Jo Stevens and Tulip Siddiq last week.\n'No one believes her!' Labour fury at Abbott for missing Brexit vote Diane Abbott faced questions from furious Labour colleagues today after she missed the historic vote on starting Brexit talks.\nThe shadow home secretary was in Westminster all day but failed to take part in a series of crucial votes from 7pm last night.\nLabour MPs were under orders from Jeremy Corbyn to back the Bill and four shadow ministers - including three from the shadow cabinet - quit posts to oppose the law.\nSources close to Ms Abbott said she was taken ill at around 5pm and had to head home to Hackney after speaking in Westminster Hall. Her diary is said to have been cleared for the rest of the week.\nJust 15 Labour MPs failed to make it into the Commons division lobbies for the three votes, including the historic vote in principle on changing the law to allow Theresa May to start Brexit.\nOne furious Labour backbencher pointed out to MailOnline that Shadow communities Secretary Grahame Morris and Ronnie Campbell had both voted despite recently undergoing cancer treatment.\n'No-one believes she was ill. People who are seriously ill came down and voted and she went AWOL.\n'She didn't have the balls to vote for the Bill.\n'People are very angry at her. Others have resigned, but she won't because she is a mate of Jeremy's.'\n'It's exactly what you expect from them. It is one rule for Corbyn's mates and another for everyone else.'\nMs Abbott appeared to speak in Westminster Hall at 3.39pm, leading for Labour in a debate on the Prevent counter-extremism strategy.\nAnd she issued a series of tweets during the afternoon, including oner at 6.02pm about a column she had written for the Morning Star.\nA source close to Ms Abbott said: 'Diane was in Westminster all day and was planning on staying and voting, she even spoke in a Westminster Hall debate.\n'She informed us that she had to go back to Hackney at about 5 due to migraines.'\nMr Corbyn now faces the dilemma of whether to sack a further 13 frontbenchers who defied his order to back the EU withdrawal bill.\nBut after a massive 47 Labour MPs rebelled against him in the crucial vote last night, he could struggle to find enough replacements.\nAnd in a further humiliation, it has emerged that Diane Abbott, one of his closest allies, failed to vote.\nShe claimed she had been 'taken ill' at around 5pm - even though she took part in a lengthy debate in Westminster Hall just over an hour beforehand.\nMs Abbott's absence has deepened tensions in the party and Labour MPs said it was 'disgraceful' that she could be allowed to get away with not voting for the bill when others had resigned.\nOne furious Labour backbencher pointed out that shadow communities secretary Grahame Morris and Ronnie Campbell had both voted despite recently undergoing cancer treatment.\n'No one believes she was ill. People who are seriously ill came down and voted and she went AWOL,' the Labour MP said. 'She didn't have the balls to vote for the bill.\n'People are very angry at her. Others have resigned, but she won't because she is a mate of Jeremy's.'\n'It's exactly what you expect from them. It is one rule for Corbyn's mates and another for everyone else.'\nEight MPs, including Labour's Chris Bryant and Mary Creagh, opposed the legislation to trigger Article 50 last night despite their constituents having decisively backed Brexit in the referendum.\nDozens more voted in favour of holding the EU referendum two years ago - but voted against implementing the result.\nJust one Tory MP, arch-Europhile Ken Clarke, joined the Brexit opponents in the division lobbies.\nThe votes came after two days of bad-tempered and impassioned debate in parliament.\nEx Chancellor George Osborne - who led the charge for Remain - earlier warned opposing Brexit risked a 'constitutional crisis'.\nMr Corbyn said: 'MPs have a duty to represent their constituents as well as their party, and I understand the difficulties that MPs for constituencies which voted Remain have in relation to the European Union withdrawal Bill.\n'However, it is right that the Labour Party respects the outcome of the referendum on leaving the European Union.'\nOne furious Labour MP yelled 'suicide' as the result was read out in the chamber tonight\nThe government secured a thumping majority in both the key Commons votes tonight\nDawn Butler (left) and Rachael Maskell (right) resigned from the shadow cabinet tonight rather than fall into line with Jeremy Corbyn's stance of supporting legislation that will trigger Article 50\nNeil Coyle (pictured in the Commons today), the Labour MP for Bermondsey was ordered to apologise for describing Tory MPs as 'b '\nIn a statement, Ms Butler praised Mr Corbyn for pushing the government to give parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit.\nBut she said: 'Unfortunately I still feel strongly that I want to send a message to our Prime Minister that I do not agree with the direction she is [taking the country in] the way for me to do that is to vote against this second reading.'\nBREXIT VOTE: WHAT LAST NIGHT MEANT MPs have backed Brexit in an historic vote that effectively makes the process irreversible.\nFor the first time, the Commons has supported the principle of legislation that gives the Prime Minister power to trigger Britain's exit from the EU.\nA wrecking amendment tabled by the SNP was heavily defeated, before the EU Bill was given its second reading.\nThe government also comfortably won the third vote - setting the timetable for the rest of the bill's progress.\nMs Maskell said: 'The UK is no longer being offered a 'people's Brexit' but a 'Theresa May Brexit', which goes far beyond just leaving the European Union, as voted on at the referendum last June.'\nThe resignations came hours after Labour MP Neil Coyle was ordered to apologise for branding Tory MPs 'b ' in the historic Brexit debate in the Commons.\nIn one of the most inflammatory section's of today's marathon debate, Mr Coyle said: 'Former prime minister John Major referred to the like of the former secretary of state for work and pensions as b .\n'He could not have known that his party would become a whole Government full of b who are absolutely causing economic damage for my constituents and for the whole country.\n'At the risk of offending my own front bench as well as the Government front bench, I say this - my members campaigned vigorously to remain in the European Union and they deserve a front bench position that is not to sign up to the Government's position, the Government's timetable and the Government curtailing debate.\n'It is a disgrace.'\nMr Bercow told the Labour MP: 'You shouldn't have used the word you used.\n'You tried to wrap it up in a Quote: but it was very unseemly and rather undignified and quite unnecessary, and you shouldn't have done it, and you should apologise.'\nMr Coyle said: 'While I share the former prime minister's sentiment, I apologise if it is unparliamentary language.'\nMr Bercow replied: 'It was unparliamentary language and you shouldn't do it again.'\nMr Coyle vowed to defy the referendum result - despite backing the poll - in the Commons lobbies tonight.\nEx-chancellor George Osborne admitted he had given up his career in support of the Remain campaign and warned the negotiations to come would be difficult\nMrs May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were engaged in bitter clashes over Brexit at Prime Minister's Questions earlier today\nThe decision to produce the paper after tonight's landmark Commons vote on Article 50 will cause irritation among Remain campaigners.\nBut the publication will be another crucial step toward Britain's exit from the European Union.\nIn the debate, ex-chancellor Mr Osborne admitted he had 'sacrificed' his career in support of the Remain campaign and warned the negotiations to come would be difficult.\nHe warned it is 'unfashionable in schools these days' to teach what he believes is a 'true tale' of Britain's history, including Magna Carta, the Glorious Revolution, the Founding Fathers of the American constitution, the Great Reform Act and female emancipation.\nHe went on: 'We have given the modern world a version of democracy that has spread far beyond our shores.\n'And therefore to vote against the majority verdict of the largest democratic exercise in British history I think would risk putting Parliament against people, I think it would provoke a deep constitutional crisis in our country, I think it would alienate people who already feel they are alienated, and I am not prepared to do that.'\n'So I will be voting for the Bill tonight.'\nTheresa May used Prime Minister's Questions to announce her Brexit white paper will be published tomorrow\nMPs gathered today for the second marathon day of debate on the bill's second reading. By 7pm, the debate will have run for around 17 hours\nBut in a warning to Mrs May, Mr Osborne he added: 'The Government has chosen – and I respect this decision – not to make the economy the priority. They've prioritised immigration control.\n'The European Union isn't prioritising the economy either in these negotiations... while they understand that Britain is a very important market for their businesses, their priority is to maintain the integrity of the remaining 27 members of the EU.\nBREXIT DAY WILL BE MARCH 9 Theresa May has set a target date of launching the formal Brexit process on March 9.\nThe Government is aiming to push through its EU Bill through Parliament by March 7, which would allow the Prime Minister to trigger Article 50 at a summit of European leaders on March 9 and 10.\nMinisters told the House of Lords yesterday that it hopes to have the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill approved by March 7.\nThe following day - March 8 - is the Budget, before Mrs May travels to Brussels for the long-awaited Brexit showdown with her EU counterparts.\nThe PM has promised to trigger Article 50, the formal mechanism for quitting the EU, by the end of March.\nBut she does not want to get off on the wrong foot with EU leaders by clashing with the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, which effectively gave birth to the EU.\nShe could tell her European counterparts of her timetable at a meeting in Malta on Friday.\nThe timetable could be knocked off course if the Lords initiate what is known as parliamentary 'ping-pong' by sending the bill back to the Commons with a series of amendments.\n'They are not interested in a long and complex hybrid agreement with the UK. Therefore both sides are heading for a clean break.'\nLabour's Chris Bryant said he would go against the majority in his Rhondda constituency which backed Leave on June 23 and vote against the Brexit Bill.\nHe said: 'I am a democrat but I believe in the form of democracy that never silences minorities and I think the 48% in this country have a right to a voice and for that matter the 46% or the 45% or whatever the actual figure was in my constituency.\n'Today I'm afraid I am voting and speaking on behalf of a minority of my constituents.'\nHe warned the Government's Brexit plans would do 'untold damage' to his constituents and make the UK 'poorer' and 'weaker'.\nBut he acknowledged voting against the majority view of his constituents could cost him his job.\nHe said: 'In the end there is no point in any single one of us being a member of this House if we don't have things that we believe in and that we are prepared to fight for and, if necessary, lay down our job for.'\nEarlier at PMQs, Mrs May told MPs: 'That white paper will be published tomorrow'.\nThe white paper - conceded by Mrs May last month - will be based on the 12-point plan contained in her historic Brexit speech at Lancaster House.\nMrs May's spokeswoman refused to comment on the length of the white paper or elaborate on its contents.\nMPs are expected to vote by a landslide at 7pm tonight for legislation on starting Brexit talks - despite as many as 100 rebel MPs vowing to vote against the referendum.\nUrging MPs to back the Article 50 bill tonight, Mrs May told the Commons: 'This House has a very simple decision to take.\n'We gave the right of judgment on this issue to the British people. They made their choice. They want to leave the EU.\n'The question every member must ask themselves as they go through the lobbies tonight is: 'Do they trust the people?''\nTonight's Commons vote on Article 50 and tomorrow's white paper pave the way for Mrs May to launch her talks with the EU next month, in time for her deadline of the end of March\nLABOUR REVOLT GROWS AS LEWIS THREATENS TO QUIT Corbyn ally Clive Lewis could quit the shadow cabinet next week if the Government refuses to amend the Brexit bill.\nThe shadow business secretary will back the legislation tonight - unlike scores of his colleagues.\nBut he has confirmed he will not agree to the bill at its final stage if it is not amended.\nLosing Mr Lewis would be a heavy blow to Mr Corbyn, who has already seen two shadow ministers quit so they can vote against Article 50.\nA spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn today refused to spell out the consequences for front benchers who defy his orders to back the legislation.\nA string of Labour shadow ministers and whips have said they cannot support the legislation - a position that would normally see them sacked if they refuse to resign.\nBut the spokesman refused to confirm this would happen, telling reporters only that a decision would be taken 'later'.\nAt least 30 Labour MPs are expected to vote against the Bill when it is called after 7pm tonight.\nAsked if he would vote in favour of the EU Bill if he was still a Labour MP, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he 'accepted the verdict of the British people'.\nHe told MailOnline: 'I am quite clear that as far as the EU exit is concerned the British people did vote to leave the EU, did vote to leave the EU structures.'\n'I accept the verdict of the British people.'\nMr Khan insisted his focus was on pressuring the government to maintain 'privileged access to the single market'.\nLabour MP Chris Bryant (left) today admitted he would vote against the wishes of his Rhondda constituents - who heavily backed Brexit\nFollowing tonight's second reading vote, the legislation will come back to the Commons next week for more scrutiny - and it is expected to be law by the end of the month.\nDebate resumed this afternoon and first on his feet was former Labour leader Ed Miliband who urged his party to back the Article 50 Bill.\nCHOOSE BREXIT: SNP MP SLAMS ARTICLE 50 WITH TRAINSPOTTING SNP MP Hannah Bardell borrowed from Trainspotting in today's Brexit debate\nSNP MP Hannah Bardell channelled the movie Trainspotting today to slam Brexit.\nA famous speech, delivered by actor Ewan McGregor in the 1996 film, called on viewers to 'Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family'.\nMs Bardell told MPs: 'Choose Brexit. Choose making up numbers from thin air about the NHS and plastering them on the side of buses. Choose racist and xenophobic sentiments seeping out from some corners of the Leave campaign.\n'Choose hate crime rising by over 40 per cent and LGBT hate crime by 150 per cent in England and Wales following the Brexit vote.\n'Choose taking the people of our nations to the polls on one of the most important issues of a generation with nothing written down and no plan.'\nHe said: 'I didn't want this referendum... The reason was that I felt the country had many, many other problems it faced and that the referendum would become as much about the state of the country as about Britain's place in Europe.\n'That is water under the bridge... I said I would accept the result and I do and that is why I will be voting for the Second Reading tonight.\n'We do not want to give the sense that people who voted for Brexit because they felt they had been ignored are being ignored once again.'\nLiberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: 'Democracy means accepting the will of the people – at the beginning of the process and at the end.\n'Democracy means respecting the majority and democracy means not giving up your beliefs when the going gets tough.'\nEx Scottish first minister Alex Salmond said: 'The choice the House will get is a bad deal or no deal.\n'Therefore, it is crucial that when the House debates that and comes to a decision there is a meaningful vote, a vote that can made a difference as opposed to a Hobson's choice with a metaphorical gun at the House's head.'\nBrexit supporters queued up to back the Bill.\nConservative MP Chris Green said: 'The British people had 40 years to make up their mind when looking at the European Union.\n'It wasn't about the last few weeks of a referendum campaign, it was about the lived experience in the European Union.\n'That's why the people rejected it, not because of a few debatable arguments from one side or another.'\nAs debate on the Article 50 bill resumed today, first to his feet was former Labour leader Ed Miliband who urged his party to back the legislation\nCharlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover, said: 'I for one will be voting to respect the result.\n'The leader of the Liberal Democrats seems to think this is like Hotel California - you can check out and you can never leave.\n'I don't think that is the right approach to take. The SNP think you should just have multiple referendums until you get the right result.\n'My constituents have been very clear. Number one - there must be an end to unchecked EU migration. Number two - no more billions for bloated Brussels bureaucrats.'\nThe text will be at the heart of the impending 'hand to hand combat' in parliament - sparked by the Supreme Court's ruling that Theresa May cannot use executive powers to invoke Brexit\nTonight's vote and tomorrow's white paper pave the way for Mrs May to launch her talks with the EU next month, in time for her deadline of the end of March.\nTalks will last for up to two years, after which Mrs May hopes to have secured an amicable Brexit and a free trade deal with the EU.\nSpeaking at Lancaster House a fortnight ago, Mrs May said her 12-point plan will see Britain regain full control over borders and quit both the single market and European Court of Justice.\nShe insisted the UK can become a great, outward-looking trading nation.\n'We seek a new and equal partnership – between an independent, self-governing, global Britain and our friends and allies in the EU,' she said.\n'Not partial membership of the European Union, associate membership of the European Union, or anything that leaves us half-in, half-out.\n'We do not seek to adopt a model already enjoyed by other countries. We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave.\n'The United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. My job is to get the right deal for Britain as we do.'\nIn the face of potential rebellion, the PM agreed last week to put her plans in writing in a formal white paper.\nTHE BREXIT REBELS IN FULL: THE 114 MPS WHO VOTED AGAINST THE ARTICLE 50 BILL 114 MPs voted against giving the European Union (Notification of Withdrawl) Bill a second reading. The Bill gives Theresa May the power to invoke Article 50 and start the two year, irreversible process of Brexit.\nThe group included 50 SNP MPs, 47 Labour, seven Liberal Democrats alongside Tory Ken Clarke and nine others.\nLady Hermon (Independent - North Down)\nMeg Hillier (Labour (Co-op) - Hackney South and Shoreditch)\nStewart Hosie (Scottish National Party - Dundee East)\nDr Rupa Huq (Labour - Ealing Central and Acton)\nGeorge Kerevan (Scottish National Party - East Lothian)\nCalum Kerr (Scottish National Party - Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk)\nPeter Kyle (Labour - Hove)\nMr David Lammy (Labour - Tottenham)\nChris Law (Scottish National Party - Dundee West)\nCaroline Lucas (Green Party - Brighton, Pavilion)\nAngus Brendan MacNeil (Scottish National Party - Na h-Eileanan an Iar)\nRachael Maskell (Labour (Co-op) - York Central)\nJohn Mc Nally (Scottish National Party - Falkirk)\nKerry McCarthy (Labour - Bristol East)\nStewart Malcolm McDonald (Scottish National Party - Glasgow South)\nStuart C.
