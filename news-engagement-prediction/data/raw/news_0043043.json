Credit: PA \nParliament will today debate Donald Trump's state visit in response to petitions signed by more than two million Britons as protests take place across the UK against the US president. \nMore than 1.85 million people called for the visit later this year to be watered down to avoid causing \"embarrassment\" to the Queen. \nAlmost 312,000 have signed a counter petition, demanding the state visit go ahead as planned. \nMPs will debate both stances in Westminster Hall, while thousands are expected to gather for a rally in Parliament Square. Thousands protested against Donald Trump's travel ban in central London earlier this month.

Bush was in office before he was offered a UK state visit. 7 The number of days Donald Trump was in office before he was offered a UK state visit. \nCalls for the state visit to be cancelled have been backed by London mayor Sadiq Khan, who hit out at the president's \"cruel and shameful\" policies during an appearance on ITV's Peston On Sunday. \nMr Khan said the executive-ordered travel ban aimed at people from seven Muslim-majority countries, which has stalled in the US courts, and the suspension of refugee admissions were reasons not to be \"rolling out the red carpet\". Sadiq Khan said the UK should not be 'rolling out the red carpet' for Donald Trump. Credit: Peston on Sunday \nMr Khan, who is a Muslim, said: \"I love America, I love Americans and I believe the special relationship is a good one and one that's here to stay. \n\"But when you're mates with somebody, when you've got a special relationship, of course you are side-by-side with them in times of adversity but when they are wrong you call them out.\" \nThe government said ministers believe \"the President of the United States should be extended the full courtesy of a state visit\" in its official response to the petitions, adding: \"We look forward to welcoming President Trump once dates and arrangements are finalised.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T12:04:10.362+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
