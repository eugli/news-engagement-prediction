Now the “Cash Me Ousside” viral star is taking aim at the Kardashians . \nIn fact, Danielle says she could take the whole family down! \nIn case you miraculously missed the start of her 15 minutes of fame, Danielle made headlines in September when she appeared on Dr. Phil in a segment about her bad behavior. \n“Cash me ousside,” she slurred in the direction of the disapproving audience. “How ‘bout dah?” \nCapitalizing on her newfound Internet fame, Dr. Phil had the 13-year-old back on the show this month. \n“I made you just like how Oprah made you,” she told him during her reprise appearance. “You were nothing before I came on this show.” \nThen Danielle lashed out at the Kardashian fam — Kylie Jenner in particular — in a radio interview with The Cruz Show . \n“I don't like her,” the teen said of Kylie. “Like the way that she does shit … It seems like she wants attention so bad. Like little bitch would do anything.” A post shared by #TheCruzShow (@cruzshow106) on Feb 17, 2017 at 1:41pm PST \n“How do you go from f—king lips the size of a twig and a body that looks like a f—king paperclip and now you look like a hourglass?” Danielle continued, referring to Kylie’s rumored and confirmed plastic surgery. Credit: Instagram \nTMZ caught up with Danielle at LAX and asked if she was worried about Kylie’s backlash. \n“Who she gonna come back at? Bitch, ain’t nobody scared of her!” Feb 16, 2017 at 12:42pm PST \nFurthermore, she’s not afraid of anyone in reality TV’s most famous family. \n“Bitch, Imma whoop every Kardashian ass there is … Bitch, f—k her. F—k you. F—k your mama. F—k your whole clique.” \nAnd she’s certainly not interested in teaming up with the Kardashians, not even Kim . \n“Do something with who?” she said, incredulous about the mere prospect of a collaboration. \n“Ain’t nobody wanna do nothing with them. F—k them. What are they here for?” Feb 19, 2017 at 2:24pm PST \n“They’re f—king talentless,” she said, before directing her hate at Kim. \n“She f—ked Ray J, now she’s famous.” \nShots fired.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T06:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T02:01:35.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
