It will also be equipped with a 500GB onboard recorder for recording the data captured and a high-speed 800Mbps connection to the ground. \nSpeaking at the ninth edition of the Global Space and Technology Convention where the new satellite project was announced, Trade and Industry Minister (Industry) S Iswaran said it would open up possibilities for a wider range of satellite data applications. \nFor instance, DSTA will use the satellite to support agencies such as the Home Affairs Ministry, Defence Ministry as well as the National Environment Agency. \nMr Iswaran added that to better support innovation in the space industry, the Government would refine its approach to ensure greater alignment with industry and deepen capabilities within public sector research performers. \n\"Moving forward, Singapore will continue to invest in small satellite research and development, but channel our resources to build deep and differentiated capabilities in a few selected areas,\" the minister said. - CNA/mz", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:15:49.408+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
