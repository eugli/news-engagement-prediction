The Trump administration’s controversial decision Wednesday to no longer protect transgender students' rights to use single-sex facilities that match with their gender identity while in school has raised concerns about discrimination and bullying in the LGBT community. \nTrump’s policy undoes protections set in place by the preceding Obama administration. But Trump courted support from the transgender community on the campaign trail when he had said transgender people could use whatever bathroom they wanted. In fact, Trump’s comments on the subject last year prompted a response from Jenner, who uploaded a Facebook video titled “Thank You Donald” with the hashtag #everyonehastopee   #flushdiscrimination .\n“Oh my God, a trans woman in New York…I gotta take a pee. Anyway, oh my God, Trump International Hotel. I love this… OK, last week, Donald Trump said I could take a pee anywhere in a Trump facility…so I am gonna go take a pee in the ladies’ room,” Jenner, the former Olympian who transitioned from Bruce to Caitlyn after coming out in 2015, said in the video.\n\n\nShe was reacting to Trump’s comments made in an NBC News interview during a town hall event in April last year when he had said: \"There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go. They use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate.” As a follow-up to NBC’s Matt Lauer’s question on if he would allow Jenner to use any bathroom in the Trump Tower, he had said: \"That is correct.”\nJenner, a Republican who has, since transitioning, become a vocal transgender activist, has not yet commented on the Trump administration’s policy, despite several celebrities and other prominent individuals voicing their opinion on the subject . But she has been a supporter of Trump and had indicated in a tweet that she may also advise his administration on LGBT issues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T14:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:07:31.560+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
