Honestly, there's probably no amount of money in the world that would compensate their daily efforts we would all die horribly without them, while they have to endure the grossest and saddest parts of what makesus human. On top of that, there's an enormousnurse shortage in the UK, which will likely get worse afterBrexit, assome hospitals relyon peoplefrom the EEA to make up 2 percent of nursing staff . Nurses are under a lot of pressure, and that pressure takes away time spent with patients.\n\"I'm happy when peopleunderstand that I'm doing more thanjust wipingstrangers' arses,\"says 22-year-old nurse Jana from Lower Saxony in Germany. Shehas been working as a trainednurse in a German hospital for six months now, and says that in thosesix monthsshe has never felt that she was given enough time for her patients, because every extra minute spent on one patientcould have been spent on the 20 others waiting for her care.\nJana was kind enough to answer every question I ever wanted to ask someone who works with humans in their most dire moments.\n\nVICE: Long toenails, faeces,puss what do you find most disgusting about yourpatients? \nJana: There are two things I really struggle with washing penises and cleaning underfingernails. I might be a nurse, but I'm also ahuman being.When you wash a penis, you have to really pull back the foreskin first. That's not always easy. Sometimespatients haven't washed for weeks and alot of gunk collects down there. The smell can make me feel sick.\nI feel similar about cleaning under people'sfinger nails the stuff under there can be anything.A colleague of mine once threw up in a rubbish bin, but that never happened to me. \nDo yourmale patients ever have an erection while you're washing them? \nSure, that happens. It's like a reflex;people can't help it. It's not that bad and at least it makes a penis easier to wash.RecentlyI came into a room with a tray of food while a patient wasplaying with himself. He didn't stopafter I came in he wasn't in a great state mentally, at that point.Some people arereally reducedto their primordial instincts in the state they're in. And I often getdisgusting jokes, which can be pretty disturbing. Or I'll have patients who are able to wash themselves but say, \"You'rebetter at it.\"That makes me feel pretty uncomfortable.\nRead:10 Questions You Always Wanted to Ask a Gynaecologist \nHow often do you do things at work that a doctor should havedone? \nThat happens every day taking blood, administering intravenous catheters, starting an IV. Basically, many doctors just pass down work, and it really annoys mewhen they forget that it's actually their job. There's often a strong hierarchy in hospitals.Some doctors really enjoylettingyou feel that they're thedoctor andyou're the nurse. One head doctor once even called me maeuschen (\"little mouse\"). I don't let those kind of things slide I asked him if he was being serious. He wouldn't have thought anything of it otherwise. That's how it is, and somenurses accept it.\nIf youhave to go to hospital, do you go to the one you work at? \nAbsolutely not.I know how things work there and Iknowhow time constraints can make it difficult to keepup the standard of care for staff. And I'm not comfortable being operatedon by people I know. I know how somedoctors and nurses talk about patients while they're unconscious.\nSo what do they say about patients who are out of it? Do they mock patients' penis sizes, for example? \nSure, that can happen. Not just around the operating table behind closed doors, too.But honestly, I think you need to have a sense of humour about itto be able to deal with the job. Imean, for example,it's awful seeing people with dementia.But it can also be really funny when someone tells you they're worried they'll miss the busevery three minutes.Sometimes you just have to laugh about it. But you always absolutely have to treat people with respect. A person with dementia might not know what's going on any more, but they still have the right to be treated like a human being.\nRead: 10 Questions You Always Wanted to Ask an Ugly Person \nHave you ever stolen medication? \nNo, that would be wrongand also nearly impossible, I think.The storageroom is always busy and themore serious stuffis locked away. Only one nurse has the key to that storage, andwhenever you take out things likeopioids or morphineit has to be documented.\nDo you ever not wash your hands before or after patients? \nWe have a standard for hygiene at the hospital. That standard is very high, and itisn't always met, to be honest.But as long as you're not unsterile, that isn't that bad. That standard is basically just a theory, and you can't always live up to it in practice due to time constraints.Itbecomes critical if, for example, you wouldn't have enough time to clean wounds properly.I just make sure I take enough time for everyone even though I might not alwayshave it.\nHave you had many patients fall in love with you? \nI think \"love\" is too big a word, but I've been offered a few phone numbers.They might have tried a few others first, though, or just doneit out of boredom. I've never had anything going onwith a patient, but so farI've never really fancied anyone either.\nRead: 10 Questions You Always Wanted to Ask an Albino \nAnd do men outside the hospitalever ask you toplay a sexy nurse at home when they find out your occupation? \nI've never met a manwho responded in thatway. Sure, people have asked meto \"play doctor\" with them, or said it hurtsbetweentheirlegs could I maybe check ifeverything is OK?But come on, I don't havetime for guys like that.\nHave you seen many people die? \nI was there for the death of about six people. The worst time was the first time I saw a woman die whenI came into the room I realised right away thatshe was struggling to breathe. When patients die,their lungs often fill up with water and they start making this awful gurgling sound.She had almost suffocated when I came in. Morphine made her relax and breathe easier, but it was too late.I'll never forget thatsound. People die every week in hospital I'll often come in in the mornings to the newsthat a patient has died or was sent to a hospice.I wouldn't say that I got used to death, but I think that I've learnt do deal with it.\nJana sent us a picture of herself that ran with the original German version of the interview. After some personalbacklash, she asked us to make her unrecognisable in her picture.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T19:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:14:42.606+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
