The other two brothers, along with their father, shifted to another house nearby,” police sources said. \nPolice said the family of nine used to stay in a single house. None of the other family members were involved in the robbery, they added. One of the landlords, who did not wish to be named, told The Indian Express that he rented his two-room set to Rajan just two days ago and said he did not know of his criminal past. \n“He (Rajan) said he was staying in a house in gali number 12 and submitted an Aadhaar card as proof. But the card was fake,” he said. The landlord added that on Saturday night, police raided his house and picked up Rajan. \nAnother landlord who rented his house to the other brothers, Vinod and Sunil, said, “They had come to me through a neighbour. They submitted their ID proofs and said they were staying in gali number 7, and wanted to shift to a bigger house. So I gave them two rooms in my building for rent at Rs 1,500 each per month. They gave me Rs 1,000 as advance and said they would pay up the rest within a week.” \nThe accused have changed five houses within two years. \nPolice said the accused used to live in the jhuggis near Aravali Apartments. When the jhuggis were cleared in 2006, they shifted to Sangam Vihar. \nThe brothers also told police that they knew the area well as they had lived there since they were born.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:50:56.503+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
