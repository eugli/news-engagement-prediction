She told WYFF-TV that English is not her first language she didn’t fully understand the writing. \n\"I never ever meant that, so I'm really sorry. Please forgive me,\" Shin said.

Some vowed to report it to federal law enforcement and others swore never to return at the eatery again. \nMelonie Henderson, a server at the restaurant, said the business caters to different nationalities and their staff consists of some minorities. \n\"They thought it meant minors, not minorities,\" Henderson said. \nThe owners immediately took down the sign and replaced it with an apologetic one that read: “Dear Customers. I am the owner Sue. I am really sorry for the sign that posted (earlier). I didn’t know what it meant. After I know, I took it off immediately. English is not my first language. And I never thought about it again. I sincerely apologize for (everything).” Kenny’s Home Cooking in Spartanburg, South Carolina.

We rely on our tips,” said server, Deborah Bright. \n“Usually our money is good until this happened,” Henderson told the station.
