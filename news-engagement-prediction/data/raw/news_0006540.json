It’s now been confirmed— The King & I is out May 19. On the record, Evans sings alongside unreleased Biggie rhymes as well as famous verses. It features the below tracks, “When We Party” and “NYC,” featuring Snoop Dogg and Jadakiss respectively. Other guests on the LP include Busta Rhymes, Lil’ Kim, Sheek Louch, and Styles P, as well as Biggie’s mother, Voletta Wallace, who narrates album interludes alongside Biggie and Evans. DJ Premier, Just Blaze, Salaam Remi, Stevie J, and Chucky Thompson produced tracks on the record. \nEvans said in a press release: \nI remember telling Ms. Wallace years ago that one day it would be really dope if I could do something similar to Natalie & Nat King Cole's Unforgettable. Knowing the love that B.I.G. had for Tyanna & Ceejay, I feel it's my duty to uphold & extend his legacy, especially his musical contributions. This project is my creative reflection of the love we had & the bond we will always have. I'm elated to share this musical journey with our fans! \nThe King & I :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T20:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T16:45:59.799+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
