He answered, “I think it could have. This is the key, no campaign manager, no campaign manager, no candidate should ever sit at a table likes this on a news program and say, ‘I don’t know. The Russians might have been the reason we lost the election.’ It’s not important whether they were or not. What’s important is that it could have been the reason, and that should never happen again.”\n(h/t Mediaite )\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett\n 2016 Presidential Race , Breitbart TV , Hillary Clinton , Robby Mook , Russia", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/IanHanchett", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Ffmr-clinton-campaign-manager-russia-could-have-been-the-reason-clinton-lost%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Fmr+Clinton+Campaign+Manager%3A+Russia+%E2%80%98Could+Have%E2%80%99+Been+the+Reason+Clinton+Lost&shortener=bitly", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Ffmr-clinton-campaign-manager-russia-could-have-been-the-reason-clinton-lost%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Fmr+Clinton+Campaign+Manager%3A+Russia+%E2%80%98Could+Have%E2%80%99+Been+the+Reason+Clinton+Lost", "http://www.mediaite.com/tv/former-clinton-campaign-manager-russians-might-have-been-the-reason-we-lost/", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F20%2Ffmr-clinton-campaign-manager-russia-could-have-been-the-reason-clinton-lost%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Fmr+Clinton+Campaign+Manager%3A+Russia+%E2%80%98Could+Have%E2%80%99+Been+the+Reason+Clinton+Lost"], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T17:48:56.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
