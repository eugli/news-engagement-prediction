Abrahamian said North Korea's chaotic trading methods have made building connections hard for Malaysian businesses. \"It's just all very ad hoc ... I actually spoke to a Malaysian businessperson who was working a little bit in North Korea. He said he sent them a couple of containers of food products and it went really well and they got paid,\" he said. \"(Then) he didn't hear from him for six months, despite multiple attempts at getting in touch.\" Would North Korea risk it? South Korea has accused its northern neighbor of the assassination. In response, North Korea's state news agency KCNA issued an angry denial to the claims, accusing South Korea of \"spreading wild rumors.\" It also lashed out at Malaysia for \"picking on\" North Korea and accused the Malaysian police of \"deciding the direction of their investigation under someone else's order with no objectivity and fairness.\" Kim Jong Nam death: What we've learned a week on If North Korea did attempt a public assassination with diplomatic consequences, it wouldn't be the first time. In 1983, North Korean agents set off a bomb in Yangon in an attempt to kill then-South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan. It killed more than 20 people, though Chun escaped. In response, Myanmar broke off relations for more than a decade. There are suggestions it may do the same now with Malaysia. \"North Korea had a pretty significant relationship with Myanmar, I would say more important than its current relationship with Malaysia and it completely squandered that relationship in order to try to assassinate the South Korean president,\" Delury said. Professor Jong said if the assassination was proven to be committed by North Korea, it could lead to the severing of diplomatic relations between the two countries. \"(If proven) it's essentially a violation of Malaysian sovereignty ... North Korea might value the killing of Kim Jong Nam much more than the bilateral relationship (with Malaysia). But it's speculation at the end of the day,\" he said.
