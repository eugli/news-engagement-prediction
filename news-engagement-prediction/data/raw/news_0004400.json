Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nAnthony Martial has failed in his latest bid to convince Jose Mourinho he deserves a regular starting place for Manchester United . \nForward Martial started Sunday's FA Cup win over Wigan on Sunday and, after being warned by boss Mourinho that he was on trial, set up two goals in the 4-0 victory. \nBut the 21-year-old’s contribution was not enough to sway Mourinho, with the United boss confirming the France forward will be back on the bench for Wednesday night’s visit of relegation candidates Hull. \nHis latest demotion this season raises serious questions about Martial's United future, with summer 2014's surprise £36million signing from Monaco having fallen short of Mourinho’s expectations.

His position is one where we have lots of options. Do you want me to leave Henrikh Mkhitaryan out after being Man of the Match and playing so well? I can’t. \n“The players pick themselves. I am just there to analyse what they do and try to be fair with them. Such a good performance, Mkhitaryan has to play tomorrow. \n\"Simple.” Martial did well but not well enough against Wigan on Sunday...

I’m the youngest coach to be in the club of 100 [Champions League games]. Every time I don’t play, I’m not happy. \n“But obviously Manchester United is much more important than me and my individual targets. What matters is United and, as everyone knows, United is a club that belongs to the Champions League.

We have two chances to be there. One is by winning the Europa League, the other is by finishing in the top four. Both achievable, both difficult, but we’re going to work hard for that.” \nMourinho also took a swipe at Liverpool counterpart Jurgen Klopp and other Premier League coaches who fielded weakened sides in the FA Cup and got dumped out of the competition. \nKlopp made nine changes and watched his Reds lose 2-1 at home to Championship Wolves, while Southampton boss Claude Puel switched 10 players and took a 5-0 thumping by Arsenal. \n“I don’t do that, even if I am the manager of a club without the same ambitions as us - especially in the FA Cup,\" said the Special One.

I understood the mistake. I understood the dimensions of my decision. \n\"It was a period where we had to play Barcelona in the Champions League. We went direct to the League Cup final against Liverpool. In that period we played Newcastle in the FA Cup and I threw it away. \n\"I understood the dimension. The FA Cup deserves respect, so I don’t do that. If I’m changing players, I do it because I have to give chances to some other players. I have to give a rest to some others. \n“I will change players against Blackburn [in the fifth round next month] because I have to give players a chance. I will change, but I’m not going with a team with seven kids. I can’t do that. I will risk, but I can’t do that.” poll loading Where will Manchester United finish this season? 5000+ VOTES SO FAR", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:51:52.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
