When schools are demolished, the right to education of Palestinian children is also threatened. This creates a coercive environment that forces certain Palestinian communities to move elsewhere. ”\n“The international community must work together to provide assistance and protection to vulnerable communities and insist that international law is respected.”\nIt comes at the end of a long legal battle by the between the Israeli government and settlers to enforce a previous demolition order for the village, which reached Israel’s High Court last year.\nThree new conservative members – including a settler - were elected to join the court on Thursday, as part of a push by Israel’s ultranationalist justice minister for it to represent right-wing Israelis.\nThe 15-member court, widely seen as a liberal bastion, has drawn criticism from Ayelet Shaked, and other pro-settlement politicians over rulings supporting Palestinian property rights in the West Bank and its occasional reversal of Israeli laws it deemed illegal.\nBritain is among the countries to voice alarm over the demolitions, amid a surge in plans for new settlement construction by Israel, which is regarded as illegal under international law.\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T21:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:26:45.892+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
