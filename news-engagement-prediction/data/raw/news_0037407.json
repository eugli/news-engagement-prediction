From targeting Karan Johar and David Dhawan, his equations with many from the film fraternity have only turned bitter over the years. After making some distasteful remarks about David Dhawan, Govinda insulted his son and actor Varun Dhawan. \nMid-Day \nMany of Varun's fans and critics have time and again praised him and called him an interesting mix of Govinda and Salman. However, this comparison hasn't gone down too well with Govinda. A report had quoted Govinda saying, 'Varun can never be like me'. \nTwitter \nAfter staying mum on these remarks, Varun Dhawan has finally decided to break his silence. Unlike other stars, who would have slammed Govinda back for his remarks, Varun had a rather dignified response to Govinda's comments. \nVarun was quoted saying, \"There should be criticism. I learn a lot from criticism. He says there is no similarity between him and me which is right. There cannot be similarities. He is a senior actor and I respect him. I will never be able to match up to him.\" \nNow, this proves that Varun is a true superstar and his recent success hasn't gone to his head. The 'Badrinath Ki Dulhania' actor has his heart at the right place and now we know why people shower him with so much love and affection!
