SEE ALSO: Driving in rain is no problem for this self-driving car \nRoborace says the winning Devbot 1 hit a top speed of 186 kph (115 mph) during the contest. Formula E's normal manned cars can reach about 225 kph (140 mph) , not waaay faster than the self-driving car. That said, it was only driving with one other car on the course â€” adding more competitors to the field could slow it down a bit. Devbot 1 wins!

Who let the dogs out? We've always wanted obstacles in Roborace ðŸ˜‰ #BAePrix pic.twitter.com/jUOyLqnrie \nâ€” Roborace (@roborace) February 18, 2017 \nWhile the Devbot 1 handled the unexpected challenge of dodging a moving dog, driving through the course at full speed was too much to handle for Devbot 2. The car took a corner too sharply, overcorrected, and smashed up against the wall, ending the first ever totally autonomous public race in a crash. PapelÃ³n de un vehÃ­culo autÃ³nomo en Puerto Madero: el Roborace sin conductor chocÃ³ contra la estatua de Lola Mora \nâ€” Autoblog Argentina (@Autoblogcomar) February 18, 2017 \nThe crash is a disappointment for Roborace, which was working to bring the autonomous racing action to Formula E tracks before the 2017 season ends this summer. But it's not all bad news: the AI system will learn from its mistakes and be in a better position than it was before the crash. Look for another demonstration at the next Formula E race in Mexico City on April 1 to see how much closer we are to successful self-driving car races.
