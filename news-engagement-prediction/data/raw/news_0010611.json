Suppression needed to ensure fair trial: Defence \nDefence lawyer Stacey Carter has now told the court that the 19-page psychiatric report demonstrated her client had a mental incompetence defence. \n\"It's the view of the psychiatrist that he was acutely psychotic at the time of these offences,\" Ms Carter told the court. \n\"We were concerned about whether we would be able to take instructions from [the man] but the report does indicate we may be in a position now to take instructions.\" \nThe man watched the hearing via a video link from where he was being held, but did not speak other than to confirm he could hear the proceedings. \nMs Carter asked for a suppression on her client's identity to continue saying identity was still an issue and she did not want the public to be able to search for him on the internet. \n\"It is my application that we review that material before his identity is spread out to the community, because that would prejudice his trial, if he was to have one,\" she said. \n\"He will have trial by the community as soon as his name is released people will go to the internet and immediately look, there are not only videos there is also publications with his name associated with it.\" Magistrate 'surprised' videos still online \nMagistrate Ian White expressed concern and surprise that the videos were still available online. \n\"Not any more I hope?\" he asked. \n\"They are still on the net despite them being the subject of terrorism charges, really?\" \nWhen told the videos were still online Mr White said \"I am surprised by that situation\". \nCommonwealth prosecutor John Clover said it was \"rather difficult to remove things from the internet\". \nWhen asked by Mr White to take instructions from an AFP officer in the court Mr Clover confirmed they had not been completely removed. \n\"I am advised they are still available online, the issue being they have been reposted in various ways,\" he said. \nMr White continued the suppression order on the man's identity and the case will return to court in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:41:27.095+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
