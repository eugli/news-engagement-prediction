A cold and snowy winter is forcing them to feed on false truffles, an underground mushroom common in the Sumava mountain region shared by Czechs, Austrians, Germans – and wild boars. From ‘beached’ snow orcas to snowboarding in the streets, B.C. residents are embracing the snow \nThe mushrooms can absorb high levels of the radioactive isotope Cesium 137. And three decades ago the nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl released a fair amount of Cesium 137 that eventually drifted down on the Sumava mountains. \nNow the boars are eating the mushrooms, and ingesting the Cesium 137 along with them. That’s making their meat radioactive, Jiri Drapal at the State Veterinary Administration told Reuters. \n“It is more or less a seasonal issue,” Drapal said. \nBut it’s a long season. The half-life of Cesium 137 is 30 years – that is, it takes 30 years for the radioactivity of the isotope to fall to half its original value. \nThen another 30 to fall to half again, and so on. The boars could be glowing for quite a while. \n“We can’t say that there is any significant decrease of the values which are ranging from single units to thousands of becquerells,” Drapal said. \nAnd that could cause some problems with the supply of boar meat, which is popular in the Czech Republic. It often shows up on restaurant menus in goulash, a thick stew of meat, sauce and dumplings. \nAny boar that ends up as goulash ought to be safe. Every wild animal hunted, not only boars, must be inspected before its meat can get to customers. Radioactive meat is banned from circulation, Drapal said. \nThat’s the good news. The bad news is that 614 animals were inspected from 2014 to 2016, and 47 per cent were above the limit. \nThe semi-good news is that even meat from radioactive animals would be a health hazard only in large doses, Drapal said. You would have to eat it several times a week for couple of months, to get sick, he said. © 2017 Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T21:28:36.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
