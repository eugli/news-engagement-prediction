No deals are currently in place. \nThe untitled project comes after Torres' exit from Suits midway through season six. Her departure from the series was amicable, as the actress made her desire to return to her home base in Los Angeles ( Suits shoots in Toronto) known to producers. \n\"Toward the beginning of season five, Gina expressed that, due to personal stuff going on in her life, she needed to be in L.A. more. We formulated a plan at that point to try and gracefully exit her from the show,\" series creator Aaron Korsh told THR in September. \"She said at the time that if Suits were shot in L.A. she’d be on it forever, and if I had my way, she’d be on it forever.\" \nPearson was written out in the midseason finale of season six when she left the firm, and New York, to start anew in Chicago. \nIt did not take long for Torres to line up a new gig, having joined ABC's The Catch for its upcoming sophomore season. The veteran actress has also been fielding broadcast pilot offers. \nNow in its sixth season, Suits currently ranks as USA's longest-running show. The legal drama has already been renewed for season seven. \nUSA Network and UCP declined comment.
