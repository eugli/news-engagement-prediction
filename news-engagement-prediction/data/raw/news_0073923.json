Sat, 25/02/2017 - 11:37am \nOn 1 Feb 2005, it cost only $224 for a motorcycle COE. On 5 Feb 2017, the price had increased to $6412 or about 28 times. Advertisement \nDid the salary of delivery drivers increase by even 2.8 times? \nThe last time a motorcycle COE cost below $2000 was in January 2014. Within 15 months, it had increased by $4000 to above $6000. It appears a motorcycle COE may cost more than $10000 soon. \nDuring this economic contraction, PAP will of course be looking for easy ways to increase government revenue, eg increase water prices, car park changes, etc. Motorcycle COEs costing below $7000 may soon be history. \nWould be interesting to know if motorcyclists voted to increase the cost of their COEs.
