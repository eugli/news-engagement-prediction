Dale Ball of La Canada has rain gear for herself and her dogs while walking past Devil's Gate Dam toward Hahamongna Watershed Park in Pasadena on Jan. 23. (Mel Melcon / Los Angeles Times) Joseph Serna meteorologist Dave Bruno, but a second spell is expected overnight into early Tuesday.\nEven though the rainfall hasn’t been heavy compared with a series of atmospheric rivers that slammed California in January, it has sparked some concerns about overwhelming burn-scarred hillsides in the San Gabriel Valley. \nThe city of Duarte issued a yellow alert Sunday night for residents in the impact area around last year’s Fish fire, limiting where residents could park their vehicles and place their trash cans. \nThe National Weather Service issued a flood advisory for Ventura County through 8:30 a.m., warning that water could pond on roads, highways and other low lying areas. \nOutside of those issues, the rain is more good news for Southern California, which remains mired in drought but has seen remarkable gains thanks to the wettest winter it’s had in years. \n“It’s a very beneficial type of rain. With any luck it doesn’t get any heavier,” Bruno said. \nThere is enough rain to soak into the ground, helping to replenish soil moisture sapped from years of drought, but not too much as to overwhelm local watersheds, Bruno said. \nLate night cloud cover will also keep temperatures warmer in the evening Monday, with temperatures hovering around 50 degrees, he said. \nAnother storm is expected to move into Southern California on Thursday night, but most of the rain will be centered in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, Bruno said. \nCalifornia is on pace for its wettest year in recent memory. The storms have alleviated drought conditions for most of Northern California and made a significant dent in the southern half.
