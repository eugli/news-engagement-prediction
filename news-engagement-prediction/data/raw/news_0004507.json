This is also the first time that annual jewellery sales dropped below 50 tonnes since 2010, the previous lowest being the 2015 total. To put matters in perspective, the highest during this period was the 66.9 tonnes in 2010.\nSaudi Arabia remains the biggest retail consumer of jewellery, closing 2016 at 56.4 tonnes as against the previous year's 69.5 tonnes.\nCertainly, gold prices remaining stubbornly high for the better part of 2016 cramped consumer demand in the UAE. It was also hit by lower tourist arrivals, and since November 8, the virtual absence of high-spending visitors from India after that country instituted the demonetisation drive.\nThere could be other problems - just recently, authorities in Dubai removed the subsidy offered on jewellery imports. Now, they carry a 5 per cent duty. (Bullion carries no duty.) To date, jewellery retailers in Dubai have refrained from passing on the tariff increase on to their showroom prices, meaning that consumers are not feeling the pinch.\nAccording to John Mulligan, Head of Member and Market Relations at the World Gold Council, \"In some ways it is difficult to tell the immediate impact from the higher duty because of the generally weak demand in the market. But Indian (visitor) demand may be constrained and as such demand for jewellery from tourist traffic has been weak. A higher duty does not simplify the picture. \n\"But, going forward, the move will favour local jewellery fabricators because they will be exempted from any import duty.\"\nGlobal gold jewellery demand fell to seven-year low", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T16:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:58:27.283+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
