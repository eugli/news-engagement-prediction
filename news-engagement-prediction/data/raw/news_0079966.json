In fact, her decision clearly contemplates a way forward for egg farmers to challenge the California law. Judge Mueller is pretty clear that egg farmers—and not governments of states where egg farmers raise hens—have standing.\n\"Plaintiffs’ arguments focus on the potential harm each state’s egg farmers face,” Judge Mueller writes in her decision. “The alleged imminent injury, however, does not involve an injury the citizens of each state face but rather a potential injury each state’s egg farmers face when deciding whether or not to comply with\" California law.\nBut Judge Mueller ruled that \"the states did not prove California's law would hurt their citizens, only some egg producers.\"\nIn short, the wrong people made the right arguments.\nI have no problem with the standing rule, which requires a party that is suffering or might suffer injury to sue. I also support farming practices that treat animals that provide us with (or are turned into) food with respect. I actively seek out cage-free eggs. I also oppose so-called \"ag-gag\" laws.\nBut I also oppose California's efforts to tell its own farmers—and certainly famers in other states—how to raise their hens. And I oppose such rules even if those provisions—such as those that apply to farmers in other states—are probably unenforceable. This hypothetical illustrates that fact:\nCalifornia inspector : Hi, Iowa poultry farmer. I'm from California's agriculture department. Lovely farm you have here. I'd like to see inside your barn.\nIowa farmer : Get off my farm.\nCalifornia inspector : How big are your hen enclosures?\nIowa farmer : Piss off.\nCalifornia inspector : Well, okay then.\nIf California may dictate standards for raising animals in other states, then any state—in keeping with the hypothetical, let's say Iowa—could pass a law that prohibits, say, farmers from raising crops in drought-stricken areas. The justification? It's not a good use of water, and water should be conserved (rather than exported in the form of produce) in times of drought. Since California is in the midst of a decade-long drought, then that rule would effectively bar California crops from Iowa. If a handful of other states followed, then the rule could doom California agriculture—including, for example, the state's enormous wine industry.\nThe Constitution was established, in part, to prevent states from enacting laws like these. Here, the Constitution is supposed to prevent states from acting like petulant children.\n\"To put it simply, it has been the genius of the American system that we have free trade between states,\" wrote Blake Hurst, a Missouri farmer, in a piece on California's egg law in the American Enterprise Institute's online magazine earlier this year.\nPhoto Credit: Wikimedia Commons", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T12:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:17:02.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
