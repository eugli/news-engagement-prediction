It will be different from, but relate to the principles of, the city's overall general plan adopted in 2015.\nRELATED: Conventions bring more hotel stays to Houston\nA 17-member leadership group for Plan Downtown will include representatives of the city of Houston, Harris County, Central Houston, Downtown Redevelopment Authority / TIRZ No. 3, Buffalo Bayou Partnership and Theater District Houston, along with officials from East Downtown, Greater East End, Greater Northside and Midtown.\nThe process of creating the vision will include a series of meetings and public workshops with existing and potential downtown residents, employees and visitors, elected officials, neighborhood leaders and service providers for the homeless. Meetings are expected to begin this spring with a plan expected in fall.\nThe final plan will be a \"roadmap that identifies stakeholders areas of responsibility, designates a phasing strategy and pinpoints funding opportunities for projects and concepts,\" the district said.\n\"Having a thriving core is critical to Houston's success and Downtown continues to be the heartbeat of the region in many ways — culturally, economically and even in terms of our civic institutions — and it's a vital part of what makes Houston such a dynamic place,\" Pat Walsh, director of planning & development for the city of Houston, said in a statement.\nSome of the topics to be addressed include:\n• Attractions, hospitality and culture\n• Economic potential\n• Innovation and education\n• Infrastructure, mobility and transportation\n• Livability, connectivity and public space\n• Social equity\n• Technology\n• Urban planning, development and design\nAsakura Robinson — a planning, urban design and landscape architecture firm with offices in Houston — will draft the plan, along with consultants from Sasaki, Traffic Engineers Inc. and HR&A Advisors,\nThe Downtown District was formed in 1995 to revitalize the urban core. Officials have used public funds and private resources on area improvements focusing on the city blocks bordered by Interstate 10, Highway 59 and Interstate 45. It is operated under the leadership of a 30-person board, and funding comes from an assessment on downtown property owners.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/55/14/50/11848230/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/51/57/03/10940670/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/26/63/41/5978239/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/52/16/7512982/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/26/57/16/5960605/75/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/77/77/7864291/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/55/14/50/11848230/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/20/45/07/4346312/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/45/02/30/9709067/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "https://www.hotelzaza.com/memorial-city", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/16/37/12117986/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/26/57/16/5960606/75/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/56/16/37/12117986/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/real-estate/article/Fertitta-s-new-tower-to-offer-a-wealth-of-luxury-6218282.php", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/27/52/07/6201832/63/920x920.jpg", "http://www.kirbycollection.com/", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/17/35/8714052/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/20/45/07/4346312/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/46/74/07/10207704/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/34/26/15/7430999/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/61/12303463/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/42/37/13/9040608/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/45/02/30/9709067/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/56/63/7793858/10/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.thewilshirehouston.com/building-design/", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/17/35/8714052/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/21/63/10820813/4/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/66/43/8874193/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/26/63/41/5978239/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://theivylofts.com/", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/34/26/15/7430999/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/35/56/63/7793858/10/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/33/43/22/7222462/27/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/54/61/37/11737048/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/42/37/13/9040608/7/920x920.jpg", "http://www.capitoltowerhouston.com/", "https://www.hines.com/properties/aris-market-square-houston", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/52/16/7512982/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/26/57/16/5960605/75/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/33/43/22/7222462/27/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.609mainattexas.com/", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/51/21/63/10820813/4/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/51/57/03/10940670/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.valenciagroup.com/hotel-alessandra.htm", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/66/43/8874193/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/54/61/37/11737048/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/55/14/60/11848711/6/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/27/27/8222156/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/27/52/07/6201832/63/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/55/14/60/11848711/6/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/46/74/07/10207704/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/10/8729140/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/35/77/77/7864291/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/56/73/61/12303463/3/920x920.jpg", "http://marlowe-houston.com/", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/23/10/8729140/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/27/27/8222156/5/920x920.jpg", "http://rachaelkaplan.com/the-catalyst-houston/", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/26/57/16/5960606/75/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.vantagemedcenter.com/"], "published": "2017-02-27T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:18:33.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
