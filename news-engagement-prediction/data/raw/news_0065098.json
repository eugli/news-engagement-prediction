The 443.5ft level is the highest in 11 years, reports Lake Berryessa News , meaning the alien-like ‘Glory Hole’ spillway is now captivating passersby and online viewers alike. \nThe spewing of water down the flood control system has not happened since 2006. \nThe local government office of Napa County was overjoyed with the development, which was first witnessed last Friday. What a glorious sight at the glory hole spillway #LakeBerryessa from @KilkusPeter : https://t.co/KLink9FVfd pic.twitter.com/TsccdHf7Rf — County of Napa (@CountyofNapa) February 17, 2017 \nThe spillway has provoked an outpouring of amazement on Twitter, with some people posting images of how the lake looked during the drought. For first time in a decade water is overflowing the 'Glory Hole' Spillway at Lake Berryessa in Northern California.
