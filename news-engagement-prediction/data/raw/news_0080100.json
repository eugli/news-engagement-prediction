He was admitted to hospital in a coma, where he died a few days later.\nKirk, who works for the provincial health department and has 34 years of experience as a doctor, conducted the post-mortem on Schoombie on November 26, 2015.\nSignificant force\nHe determined that the cause of death was blunt force head injury and the consequences thereof.\nA diffuse axonal injury is when deep layers of nerve cells in the brain have been disrupted or torn.\nKirk said this injury was on the most severe end of the spectrum, associated with a prolonged coma and a high rate of mortality.\n\"There is no effective medical treatment or therapy for this type of injury.\"\nJudge Robert Henney asked what type of violence or force was usually needed to cause this.\n\"It usually requires being struck by a swinging object. The head must not be static. It is able to be in motion and struck by enough force, a swinging object or kick,\" Kirk replied.\nProsecutor Christopher Burke asked if this injury could be caused by someone’s head being kicked. Kirk said it was possible.\nThe court heard that Schoombie had a skull fracture on the right side of his head, indicative of a blow with significant force.\nSkull fractures\nHe had fractures at the base of his skull, caused by a blow that required even more force. He had a blood clot most commonly associated with skull fractures.\nThe left surface of his brain had contusions, bruises, and lacerations. Kirk said it was typical for these to be on the opposite side to where direct trauma was experienced.\n\"It doesn’t occur at the site of impact. The brain is mobile and will be displaced away from the direction of impact.\"\nSchoombie had damage to sacs in his lungs, as a result of pneumonia, a common complication for people in a coma.\nDefence lawyer William Booth said he did not expect the pathologist to be called on Monday and would need time to prepare a response.\nHe wanted to consult an expert on the cause of the blunt force trauma and \"whether it could have been caused by actions other than kicking\".\nThe witness left the stand, to be cross-examined at a later stage.\nThe trial continues.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=1592718209&t=artid%3d28a525c9-6971-43f8-bfb9-bd35e440d545%26People%3dcarl+schoombie%26Places%3dcape+town%26Topics%3dcrime%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?iu=/8900/24.com/Web/News24/SouthAfrica/Articles&sz=600x50&c=1592718209&t=artid%3d28a525c9-6971-43f8-bfb9-bd35e440d545%26People%3dcarl+schoombie%26Places%3dcape+town%26Topics%3dcrime%26accreditation%3dnews24%26posno%3d1"], "published": "2017-02-27T16:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T05:56:16.706+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
