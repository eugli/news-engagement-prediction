Here it is: The 30-second commercial features this passage, strung out over the course of the spot: “We believe no matter who you are, where you’re from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong. The world is more beautiful the more you accept. ” It’s a simple, powerful statement, and it appears over the top of images of various non-white-man demographics. The ad, in this political climate and weeks after Donald Trump’s inauguration, is a quiet political stance against cultural and political suppression of minorities and other disadvantaged groups. If that’s not clear from the spot itself, it becomes clearer when put alongside Airbnb’s CEO’s response to Donald Trump’s travel ban on people from seven mostly Muslim countries: Airbnb is providing free housing to refugees and anyone not allowed in the US. Stayed tuned for more, contact me if urgent need for housing — Brian Chesky (@bchesky) January 29, 2017 Trumpism has forced a lot of companies to take sides in the political debates currently raging on around the United States.

Airbnb isn’t the first company to have an ad assailed in this way on Sunday night: Coca-Cola did, too .
