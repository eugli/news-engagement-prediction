Weak cyclone season \nCyclones usually start developing after Christmas, but Mr Bufalino said it had been a slow start. \nThere has been an active upper level westerly wind over Australia this summer, tearing any potential system up. \n\"It has been quiet anomalous how strong the westerlies are aloft,\" he said. \n\"It has been making the conditions quiet hard to develop. \n\"The climate guys are really looking into it. The whole southern hemisphere has been really quiet, not just the Australian basin.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T08:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:41:04.944+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
