They are reportedly known to have enquired about the 32-year-old, three-time All-Star. \nInterestingly, the Mavericks were said to be interested in Iman Shumpert during the off-season, and the swingman is seen as one of the only pieces the champions could viably move. \nWilliams is in the final year of a $9 million deal while Shumpert is owed $31m over the next three seasons.
