But starting next week, Houstonians will be able to get their hands on all the cannoli their hearts could ever desire when Carlo’s Bakery makes its debut in The Woodlands. In an interview during the pre-Super Bowl Taste of the NFL event, Carlo’s head baker Joe Faugno tells Eater that the sweet shop’s first Houston-area outpost will open its doors in The Woodlands Mall next week. Unlike the full-scale operation that opened in Dallas last year, though, the new is one of the chain’s smaller kiosk models, designed to serve its “greatest hits,” or about 20 different sweet and savory options, including the famed cannoli and lobster tails. Fortunately, it appears as if the kiosk won’t be the only Carlo’s Bakery headed to Houston. “I don't know the area that well so I didn't realize we were that far north of the city but we are definitely looking into a full line bakery here in the city,” says Faugno. “We're excited. Texas has been good to us. Not in a million years would we have thought — Texas has just been so unbelievably hospitable.” Carlo’s Bakery will officially open its doors on February 18. Don’t be surprised if you have to wait in line. Most Read", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:24:47.421+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
