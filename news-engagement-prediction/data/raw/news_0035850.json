Story & Photo courtesy of WFSB Channel 3 our news partner. \nBy Rob Polansky \nPolice have launched a fundraising website to help cover mounting medical bills for a soon-to-be retired K9. \nOfficer Steve Vesco's K9, Iko, has a herniated disc that has almost paralyzed him. \nThe pair are with the Windsor Police Department. \nThe Connecticut Police Work Dog Association said that the dog has undergone several treatments and surgery to fix the disc. \nHowever, the expenses have gotten to be too much. \nVesco said he's been scrambling to find a way to pay for his partner's expenses. \nHis colleagues at the CPWDA set up a GoFundMe account to help with the efforts. \nThe page has been shared hundreds of times and has raised more than $3,300 in 21 hours. \nFor information on donating, click here .
