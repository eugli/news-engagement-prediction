EXCLUSIVE: Top Senate Rs have urged the WH to withdraw Puzder nomination. There are 4 firm no votes and up to 12, source says. Next on CNN — Manu Raju (@mkraju) February 15, 2017 \nMost of those lawmakers have not actually ruled out voting for the fast-food CEO, but say they are waiting to see his testimony on Thursday. But that’s a far different stance than Republican senators took with the vast majority of President Donald Trump’s other nominees, for whom they voiced support while blaming Democrats for obstruction. \nOn Tuesday, Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.), a member of Republican leadership, said he was one of those taking a wait-and-see approach. Later that day, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) told The Huffington Post that he, too, was withholding support for the moment. On Wednesday, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) cited Puzder’s employment of an undocumented immigrant as household help, which was first reported by HuffPost, as a decisive factor in his own indecision. \nRepublicans hold 52 seats in the Senate and can lose only two votes if they are still to confirm Puzder. \nAdding to Puzder’s problems, Politico on Thursday obtained a copy of a 1990 “Oprah Winfrey Show” episode in which Puzder’s former wife said he was physically abusive and had “vowed revenge” on her for speaking out. She has since retracted the allegation, but the video is emerging for the first time. \nPreviously, HuffPost reported that Puzder’s company, which owns Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., has been found guilty of a long stream of labor law violations. \n“I’m not a ‘no.’ I’m a ‘listen,’” Thune told reporters on Wednesday. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a famously gifted vote-counter, was asked Tuesday if he was confident that Puzder would be confirmed. “I’m a strong supporter of Andy Puzder,” McConnell replied, conspicuously avoiding the question.
