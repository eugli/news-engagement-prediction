I really think they need to reconsider their position and their stance specifically on this.\" \nThe Wanderers supporter group, the Red and Black Bloc, remains defiant and unapologetic on its Facebook page. \nThey have even suggested launching a new range with the lewd image. \nThe FFA has handed the Wanderers a show cause notice and described the banner as \"totally unacceptable and offensive\". \nIt said it was aware of the Red and Black Bloc's activity regarding the merchandise range. \nWanderers chief executive John Tsatsimas confirmed the club would respond to the notice, while outlining its disgust with the banner. \n\"Western Sydney Wanderers FC unequivocally states - and reinforces its position provided on Sunday after the match - that it does not in any capacity welcome, authorise or condone the display of imagery depicted in a banner on Saturday night,\" he said in a statement. \n\"It is an affront to many on a multitude of levels and is completely unacceptable. \n\"We are currently working with the venue, security and FFA to identify those involved.\" \nThe Wanderers were handed a suspended points deduction last year after fans lit flares in a previous Sydney Derby. \nThe club is expected to be hit with a hefty penalty and Pycroft was hopeful that would be the case. \n\"I would encourage the FFA to act and not only just the FFA but the Wanderers as well to act strongly and swiftly on this issue, to make sure that all fans that attend games are a safe, supportive and inclusive environment,\" he said. \nSydney FC has also demanded a formal apology on behalf of Arnold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T10:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T05:38:45.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
