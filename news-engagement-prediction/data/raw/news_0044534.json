A group of citizens want the state to break away from the rest of the US. Picture: Istock #Calexit campaign wants independence by 2019 as ‘people’s embassy’ opens in Russia Victoria Craw, news.com.au February 21, 2017 8:12am \nCALIFORNIA will be welcomed with “open arms” by the rest of the world when the wealthy western state divorces the rest of the US. \nThat’s according to the man behind the #Calexit independence campaign that has pledged to hold a vote on the issue in March 2019, citing irreconcilable differences with the rest of the country. \n‘Yes California’ founder Louis Marinelli told news.com.au the culture, mentality and outlook of Californians is much more instep with the global community than the rest of the US. \n“In many respects. [Californian mentality] is more aligned with the world view. I think that when California becomes its own country the world is going to open it with open arms,“ he said. \nThe controversial group is the brainchild of Mr Marinelli and Fresno-based Marcus Evans, who have been working for around three years on getting a Calexit referendum on the ballot under the state’s system of citizen initiatives which can see private ideas turned into law with enough support. media_camera Louis Marinelli has sparked controversy for running the campaign while living in Russia, with some critics branding him a “traitor” and a “Russian spy”.

The next phase is for a plebiscite in March 2019. \nTheir secession plan is based on the notion that the state, which is worth an estimated $3.21 trillion (USD$2.46 trillion) in annual GDP is carrying the burden for other states with which it has differing environmental, military and economic views. \nMr Marinelli said the campaign is not a reaction to President Trump but his election has boosted support. They’ve also been inspired by the recent Brexit vote and campaigns in Scotland and Catalonia. \n“It’s not about Donald Trump specifically, (we) just want California to be its own country.” \nULTERIOR MOTIVE? \nHowever the campaign has run into controversy given Mr Marinelli’s residence in Russia, where he is teaching English as a foreign language and has spoken at conferences about self-determination. \nHe has also opened a “people’s embassy” in order to “build a bridge” between the two countries which he says is not paid for out of campaign funds. It’s due to open an exhibition on civil rights in America shortly and he said its received plenty of press coverage. \n“It’s a very good tool for us. … I want to start the dialogue and we’ve been pretty successful with that so far. Russians are much more aware of the fact that California is at least thinking about independence.” media_camera The group claims California will be economically, politically and environmentally better off.

He has also denied receiving funding from the Russian government for his activities in the country. \n“We don’t have any communication with or contact with or receive any support of any kind from the Russian government or any Russian government officials,” he said. \nThe comments come amid widespread allegations by US intelligence of Russian interference in the US political system which is currently the subject of a classified FBI investigation. \nLast week, unanswered questions over the relationship between US National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador led Mr Flynn to resign just three weeks into the job. \nRussia has denied the hacking allegations, while President Trump has said he wants to pursue better relations with Russia.
