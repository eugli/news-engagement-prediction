Geoffrey-Onyeama \n“They held sway for 16 years and looted the treasury dry and it will not be too easy to clean up the rot they foisted on the nation. \n“President Buhari is working for you. He is working for us and very soon we shall get there,” he said. \nOnyeama appealed to members of his ward and residents of the state to queue in and embrace the change agenda of the APC. \nHe said that the current administration was made up of technocrats who were committed to the task of rebuilding the nation. \nEarlier, the state Chairman of the party, Dr Ben Nwoye, said that the ‘broom revolution’ was gradually turning Enugu into an APC state with the capture of notable politicians in the state. \nNwoye said that residents of the state were embracing the party in their numbers, adding that no fewer than 50,000 new members had joined in Enugu East senatorial district alone. \nThe chairman said that the ongoing registration of new members had seen 900 members register in the minister’s ward.L \n“We now have former legislators at both the state and the National Assembly and other influential faithful who defected from the PDP to our great party,” Nwoye said. \nNwoye said that the APC was well aware of future election challenges in the state and was doing everything within the law to ensure that the party was made more popular in the state in order to end the PDP misrule.
