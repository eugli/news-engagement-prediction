The boys dug deep and held on and luckily we got that try in the end,\" first-grade star Daniel Tupou said. \nThere they will meet the Panthers, who didn't even want to be in the tournament. \nPenrith boss Brian Fletcher was openly critical in the lead-up to the event regarding the club's requirement to risk the club's NRL stars in the shortened format. \nBut despite only bringing first-grade guns Nathan Cleary and James Tamou, the Panthers have gone through undefeated to also get their first shot at the trophy.

You're used to a couple of minutes when you kick and the 30 seconds starts as soon as you score. It's pretty short.\" \nSydney won two of their three pool games, including a 21-0 wipeout of Canberra on Sunday.
