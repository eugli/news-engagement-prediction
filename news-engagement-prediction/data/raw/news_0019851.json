(Photo: Photo provided by McDonald's)\n287 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Leif Kandel wanted one thing when he and his mom arrived at a west-side McDonald's i this week: a Teen Titan Happy Meal toy.\nLeif, 7, who has autism, and his mother, Bonnie Kandel, were disappointed when the employee taking their order told them the restaurant was out of that toy.\nBut another crew member, Ta’Qualliyia \"TQ\" Patterson, stepped in to offer an assist and put a smile on the little boy's face. Here, in Kandel's words posted on the Love What Matters Facebook page , is what happened:\n\"My son, Leif, has autism. He is a picky eater and has a hard time letting things go when he gets fixated on something. After a few weeks of hearing how his friend at school loved a toy from McDonald's, I knew eventually a Happy Meal was in our future. So after a few weeks we ventured out in search of the much discussed Happy Meal. We ordered and asked about the coveted Team Titans toys that were displayed on a kiosk. They had run out, no more left. They were now on to Batman. Leif was devastated.\n\"I explained more about Leif and why it was so important to him ... that he had been talking about these toys nonstop for weeks. The lovely young woman who goes by TQ heard me and understood. She asked the manager if she could dismantle the kiosk and give Leif the toys. TQ spent the next 15-20 minutes getting those toys for my son. He was overjoyed and has been playing with them for HOURS!\"\nTQ, 16, is a senior at Ben Davis High School and has worked at the McDonald’s at 10th Street and Girls School Road for two years.\nHelping her young customer \"made me feel happy,” she said. “Seeing him excited and knowing that I made him smile, it made my day.”\nFor Kandel, “TQ's sweet and generous interaction with my son was a little glimmer of hope,” she said. “All three of my children saw her express empathy and compassion. That's worth more than any toy.”\nCall IndyStar reporter Maureen Gilmer at (317) 444-6879.
