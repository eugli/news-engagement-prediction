Now it can be said he's the greatest player in NFL history. \nAfter getting smacked around and embarrassed by the Falcons until New England was trailing 28-3 with 8:31 left in the third quarter, Brady put on a comeback for the ages with a dramatic 34-28 overtime victory in Super Bowl LI. The previous largest comeback in Super Bowl history was 10 points. Brady and the Patriots trailed the Seahawks by 10 in the fourth quarter two years ago. \nBrady has now won his fifth Super Bowl Trophy, breaking the tie with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for the most ever. Brady was hit and hit some more by the Falcons defense, which went to school on what the Giants did to him in Super Bowl XLII. When Brady has time to throw, he is unstoppable. When he gets hit early, he gets a little jumpy in the pocket, misses open receivers and throws the ball in the dirt. \nBut once they went down by 25 points in the third quarter, they scored the last 31 points of the game. Brady finished with 466 yards. He was 43-of-62. He won his record fourth Super Bowl MVP. \nTen minutes after the game, Roger Goodell was booed off the podium as he handed Robert Kraft the trophy. Brady stood nearly by with tears in his eyes as fans chanted, \"Brady, Brady, Brady.\" Brady and Bill Belichick. (LARRY W. SMITH/EPA) \n\"A lot has transpired in the last two years and I don't think that needs an explanation,\" Kraft said. \"This is unequivocally the sweetest. I'm proud to say for the fifth time we are all Patriots.\" \nHow bad was it for Brady early on? \nHe threw an interception that was returned 82 yards for a touchdown by Robert Alford in the second quarter to give Atlanta a 21-3 lead. This was the 34th playoff game of Brady's career, but when he was throwing into double coverage Danny Amendola and Alford took it back the other way, which broke an incredible streak: He had not thrown a pick six in the first 1,279 postseason passing attempts. \nThe drama seemed to be gone from this game early. But it returned late. \nBrady's season started with aggravation but ended with exhilaration. Julian Edelman made an unbelievable catch for the Pats in the fourth quarter. (Patrick Semansky/AP) \nThe 2016 season opened with him finally have to serve his Deflategate season 20 months after he was accused of being involved in the deflation of footballs. It ended with just a crushing loss — he didn't play well until it was too late. \nHe also played with heartache this season knowing that his mother has been ill. She was able to attend her first game of the season Sunday. As he ran onto the field right before the game, he glanced up in the stands, as he said he would, and appeared to be looking for his mother. \nBrady started the comeback on a 5-yard TD pass to James White with 2:06 left in the third. Stepehen Gostkowski missed the extra point and the Patriots were down 28-9. \nThe Pats added a field goal with 9:44 left to get within two TDs and a pair of two-point conversions. Still not a problem for Atlanta. \nBut Matt Ryan, who had been playing a perfect game, fumbled as he was hit by Dont'a Hightower, setting up a short field that Brady converted into a five-yard TD to Danny Amendola with 5:56 remaining. White then took a direct snap for the two-point conversion. Brady with his trophy.

But it held Atlanta this time and Brady took over at his own 9 with 3:30 left. Julian Edelman made a lunging catch off a tip ball on the way to another TD by White with 57 seconds left. \nNow they were down 28-26. \nOne more two-point conversion. Brady got it with a pass that Amendola barely got over the goal line. \nAtlanta had no timeouts left and couldn't get anything going. Julio Jones made an incredible grab before the Patriots completed their comeback. (Elsa/Getty Images) \nOvertime. \nMatthew Slater called heads. It was heads. Brady then drove the Patriots 75 yards with White scoring from the two. \nIt started off awful for Brady. It ended with him leaving no doubt about his greatness. \nEven for Brady, a 25-point deficit with 23 minutes left in the game had to be too much, right? But for a season that ended with Deflategate and ended with him on the podium with Robert Kraft with their fifth Lombardi Trophy, it just can't any better for a player or a team. \nIt was an epic comeback by one of the great players who has ever played any sport at any time.
