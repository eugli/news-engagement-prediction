A campaign spokesperson said: “We were not aware of these text messages and we don’t condone the content. The campaign did not sanction the sending of these messages.” \nThe contest is a bitter battle between Labour and Ukip. Nuttall was an early favourite to win but his chances have been dented by questions over his residency in the seat, his failure to name all six pottery towns and after he was forced to admit that claims on his website about losing close friends in the Hillsborough disaster were false. \nSnell’s candidacy has also proved controversial after he was forced to apologise for making offensive remarks about women on Channel 5’s Loose Women. He also backed remain in the referendum and suggested Brexit was a “massive pile of shit”, despite Stoke having strongly voted to leave the EU on 23 June. \nUkip and Labour sources told the Guardian they now believe Labour will retain the seat, which is likely to see a depressed turnout and low voter engagement. \nThe Lib Dems have been hoping to take some of the seat’s remain supporters but on Thursday Snell received the backing of More United, the cross-party group on the progressive left which is backing pro-EU candidates. \nIt was co-founded after the referendum by Paddy Ashdown, the former Lib Dem leader, and is led by historian Dan Snow, with the aim of supporting politicians who adhere to five principles, including seeking the closest relationship with the EU or rejoining “if that becomes necessary and possible”. \nThe group, which has around 70,000 members, takes inspiration from the maiden speech by the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, who said people are far more united and have more in common than that which divides them. A poll of its members found 86% were in favour of backing Snell in Stoke. The text of the message sent to Muslim voters in Stoke \nAslamalaykam my Brothers and Sisters. \nIn this country, we Must vote due to Necessity / Majboori. \nThis does not mean that we can vote for any Tom, Dick or Harry. \nThis means that in order to stop the Far Right, Anti Muslim, Anti Islamic UKIP Party, we must vote for \nthe Strongest candidate. \nIf Dr Ali takes 500 Votes and Yaqub Mirza takes a 100 votes and UKIP defeat the Labour Party \nCandidate Gareth Snell by 550 votes, then You will have succeeded in helping to Elect an Anti \nMuslim and Anti Islam MP. \nOk, you will have made Dr Ali and Mohammed Yaqub Akram (Mirza) happy Losers. \n& \nYou will have given a slap to our local councillors. \nBut. \nWill you be able to answer for this in the Grave and on the Final Day??? \n“I helped the Enemies of Islam because ” \nMay ALLAH TALLAH Grant Us All Hidayat, Ameen.
