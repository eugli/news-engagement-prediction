It is more than 90 percent effective for women up to 10 weeks pregnant. \nIn a statement, the Guatemalan army said that it would not allow the nonprofit to carry out its activities, in adherence \"to the Constitution regarding the preservation of human life and the laws in effect in our country.\" \nThe trip was the first made by the organization since Morocco blocked a ship from entering one of its harbors in 2012, Zenevich said. \nMarleny Arias, a 50-year-old Guatemalan, heckled the ship's crew, yelling: \"Why don't you go to the Netherlands to kill children?\" \nGroup organizers defended the legality of the ship's operation, which picks up women on shore and brings them to international waters where local laws do not apply. \nOn board, women are given an abortion pill and remain under observation for a few hours before returning to land. \n\"Guatemala has been chosen because the laws are very restrictive on the subject of abortion,\" said Quetzali Cerezo, director of Women in Equity in Guatemala, which helps the Dutch nonprofit. \nIn Guatemala, where Catholic and Evangelical churches hold powerful influence, abortions are only permitted if a mother's life is at risk. \nAccording to the organization, which was founded in 1999, some 65,000 illegal abortions are performed annually in the Latin American country. \n(Reporting by Sofia Menchu; Writing by Natalie Schachar; Editing by Bill Rigby) Next In World News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:19:30.810+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
