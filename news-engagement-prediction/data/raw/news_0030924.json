You're Wrong, Bigly. “It’s about giving America what it wants.” 02/12/2017 02:07 am ET Carla   \nWhen the world got a taste of Melissa McCarthy as White House press secretary Sean Spicer and Rosie O’Donnell floated a Steve Bannon-infused profile picture , the internet demanded an all-female cast to play   on “Saturday Night Live.” \nBut the internet probably didn’t expect a Leslie Jones masterpiece. \n“I never dreamed I could play the president,” Jones says during a behind-the-scenes style skit that aired Saturday night. “But then Melissa played Spicer and I was like, ‘Yo, why can’t I play Trump?’” That moment when you've finally found your calling. @Lesdoggg #SNL pic.twitter.com/Y7Unmw5NVV   \nAs seen in the video above, Jones trained with determination to be the next orange-glazed POTUS ― golden toupee, eyebrows and all. \nThe impersonation, Jones warns her cast mates, is not a jab at Trump’s “fragile masculinity” and it isn’t a commentary on race and politics. \nJones says with certainty: “It’s about giving America what it wants.” \nThings, however, don’t turn out as planned. Just a professional disagreement between Lorne and @Lesdoggg about whether she should play Trump on #SNL . pic.twitter.com/yZFyqFTfip   \nTrump has dutifully expressed his loathing for “SNL,” especially since they’ve doubled down on POTUS since he took office, but reports this week revealed that he may have been most peeved that McCarthy, a woman, played Spicer on last week’s episode. \nNow, with Jones attempting her own version of the Donald, the world awaits a reaction from the Commander in Chief. . @Lesdoggg just took one for the team. She portrayed Trump on @SNL tonight so he gotta fire himself twice now. pic.twitter.com/2uT9nlEU1T — Matthew A.
