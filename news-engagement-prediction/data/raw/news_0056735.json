Which does make this a smartphone that is very much aimed at the affordable sector and for those looking for a functional and reliably performing smartphone, without having to pay too much. A launch price as low as this could lead some to wonder as to what they will actually be getting for their money. OUKITEL however, has been bringing to market a number of good-performing smartphones lately, while also managing to maintain an extremely competitive price. The OUKITEL U17 Max is the latest of this breed of smartphones and does offer fairly good value for money. \nThis is a smartphone that comes equipped with a 5.5-inch display which makes use of a 1280 x 720 resolution, while the rest of the body adopts a unibody design which is largely made up of a polycarbonate build. In terms of the rest of the specs, the OUKITEL U7 Max is designed to be an affordable 3G smartphone and as a result, comes packing 1GB RAM, 8GB internal storage and is powered by a MediaTek MT6580A quad-core processor (clocking at 1.0 GHz). While the storage is limited on this model, the U7 Max does come with support for microSD card expansion when needed (up to 32GB). In terms of the cameras, the U7 Max is equipped with an 8-megapixel rear camera, as well as 2-megapixel front-facing camera. While in terms of battery life, the U7 Max comes loaded with a 2,500 mAh battery which OUKITEL states should be good enough to last throughout the day. The operating system on offer out of the box is Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) although OUKITEL has confirmed that the U7 Max will be one of the smartphones that does receive the Android 7.0 (Nougat) update in due course. \nAs part of the launch proceedings, OUKITEL has also confirmed that they are running a giveaway on their official Facebook page where you could win the OUKITEL U17 Max for free. The giveaway has started today and will run through until March 3.
