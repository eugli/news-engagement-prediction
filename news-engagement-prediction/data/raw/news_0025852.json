Aldon Smith (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 7:10 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 7:10 p.m. ET \nAldon Smith's latest legal issues could end his tenure with the Raiders. \nThe linebacker is under investigation by San Francisco police after a possible domestic incident last weekend, TMZ.com reported Monday . SN's Alex Marvez notes the Raiders have a zero-tolerance policy with regard to domestic violence. If police find reason to believe Smith committed a crime, the team would likely cut ties with Smith soon after. \nSmith has one year remaining on a two-year contract he signed with the Raiders prior to the 2016 season. \nMORE: Most heinous crimes connected to athletes \nTMZ reported San Francisco police were called to a house in the city early Saturday. It was not known whether officers went to a house Smith owns in San Francisco or another residence in the city. A police spokeswoman told the San Francisco Chronicle that Smith has not been arrested and that he and his accuser are cooperating with investigators. \nSmith, 27, hasn't played in the NFL since 2015 because of a string of off-field issues. He was suspended for the entire 2016 season for violating the league's substance-abuse policy. \nSmith filed for reinstatement on Oct. 3 before meeting with commissioner Roger Goodell. His bid was deferred until March. NFL Media reported last week that Smith is expected to be reinstated in March. The report was published before the incident in San Francisco. \nOmnisport's Joe Rodgers and Ron Clements contributed to this report.
