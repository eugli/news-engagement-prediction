I nearly switched my choice for Best Picture from No Country For Old Men to Juno after watching it. It's a sweet film that is not only funny, but realistic. The acting is all great here. Michael Cera is always great and should get his reward sooner than later. Jason Bateman is perfect as the uneasy husband, and Jennifer Garner has done the best work of her career. Ellen Page is very good, but I felt she was a little overrated, but deserving of that Acadmy Award nod in every way -- and she had my vote. J.K. Simmons is probably the best in the film, arguably so. The writing is well done, and deserved the win. Though I think Diablo Cody should change her name, considering she's now a full-fledge writer and no longer works the pole. The film is funny and sweet and dramatic, but some of the jokes made me laugh out loud, and others had me staring and waiting for the story to continue. The music is great and fits the film perfectly. In my own opinion and personal observation, this film DOES NOT support teen pregnancy, only it provides a story of a realistic teen recieving the bun in the oven in no graphic way, finding a way to deal with the stress, and as she waits for the baby to be born she meets interesting and loving people along the way. Overall, this film has hardly any profanity, no nudity, and nothing graphic of any sort. The acting, writing, and direction is all well done, and that makes it the second-best film of 2007. Buy this film, I guarantee one will like it even if they don't rent it first. But people have different taste, so you may want to get it on DVD then decide on if you want it on your iPod. Brilliant! by k8lin This would be one of my favorite movies of all time.Ellen Page was FANTASTIC in this movie.Her brilliant acting made me think a lot higher of her than in her previous movies.Michael Cera is getting popular by the minute.His very nonchalant acting made him absolutely PERFECT for the role of Bleeker. Aside from that,the soudntrack of this movie is AWESOME.They used the perfect songs to go with this movie.They`re very Indie and laid-back type of songs. All in all,Juno was a VERY good movie.It made me laugh,cry,and think all at the same time. Thanks iTunes for putting this movie up! Great Film... Many Ways To Obtain by New Ontario This comedy was great in such a unique way. It's funny while not being over the top like how \"Knocked Up\" was. The setting is down-to-earth and the emotions felt real. In short, Juno takes a theme that easily could have been down right wrong and offensive and made it into an entertaining and worth-while film that can be enjoyed by many. Obviously there is iTunes, ripe and ready for the download to begin. But if you must have the DVD, get the 2-Disc Edition. It may cost a few extra bucks, but you get an iTunes Digital Copy of the movie that can work on a Mac or PC. Not to mention that the digital copy can be sent to an iPod or iPhone for when your on the go. Juno is one of the best films out this year so far, so download it, rent it, or get the 2-Disc Edition. You will not be disappointed. Viewers Also Bought", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:09:25.511+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
