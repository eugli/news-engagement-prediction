Bosses at Scotland-based craft beer company BrewDog are giving their almost 1,000 employees around the world one week’s paid leave when they welcome a new puppy into their lives. “ It’s not easy trying to juggle work and settle a new dog into your life, and many members of our crew have four-legged friends at home,” said BrewDog’s co-founder, James Watt. “So we wanted to take the stress out of the situation and let our teams take the time they need to welcome their new puppy or dog into their family.” Founded in 2007 by Watt and Martin Dickie (and the company’s mascot, labrador Bracken ), BrewDog has offices in Aberdeenshire, Glasgow and London, as well as 50 bars worldwide. A new brewery is opening in Columbus, Ohio. At the company’s Aberdeenshire headquarters alone, 50 “office dogs” regularly accompany their owners to work. Employees around the world are eligible for the new perk. BrewDog revealed details of the new benefit ― dubbed “pawternity” or “mutternity” leave ― on its website Monday, and said it was part of its plan to “be the best company to work for, ever.” ” We’re not aware of any other American company giving a week’s leave to their staff to help build the bond between them and their dog ― but then few other companies have four-legged friends at their center as we do,” the statement read. The move has received an overwhelmingly positive reaction on social media: — Cathy Mace (@cathycmace) February 13, 2017 Brewdog offering employees puppy parental leave is the greatest thing ever 🐶 pic.twitter.com/TlNH0EGB6T — Calum Mitchell (@calumitchell) February 15, 2017 @BrewDog Brilliant idea, and great PR 🐶 — Carol Davis-Mann (@CarolDavisMann) February 16, 2017 \nBrewDog said the publicity had also resulted in an uptick in applications from people keen to work at the company. \n“It’s awesome to see puppy parental leave resonating so much with so many people,” spokeswoman Sarah Warman told The Huffington Post. “We’re looking forward to many of our teams taking time off to care for their new four-legged friends. Hopefully they’ll bring them into the office to meet the rest of us, too!” Related Coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T17:19:25.792+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
