For a sophomore to have that when the stage is big and the lights are on shows that he has no fear.\" \nRegan's 3-point shooting has helped the Rams to a 13-5 overall record and put them in the hunt for the Tri-County Conference-Classic Division title. He is averaging 11.9 points per game - third on the team behind Mike Hiester and Cam Irizarry - and has adjusted nicely to the varsity level. \n\"In the first quarter of the first game I was a little nervous, but all of a sudden I started hitting a few shots and that got me into it,\" Regan said. \"It's a lot easier now.\" \nRegan's older brother Austin was a key player two years ago on the Gloucester Catholic team that won the Classic Division. He is now playing Division II basketball at Philadelphia University. \n\"I watched him play for a few years and I always wanted to be out there like him,\" Regan said. \"He's always in my ear telling me what to do and he helps me get better.\" \n• Speaking of younger brothers, Kolby Braxton is doing a fine job as the starting point guard for Delsea . He is the sibling of former Crusaders star Keith Braxton , now a freshman at Division I St. Francis (Pa.). \nKolby Braxton joked that his brother has overshadowed him by winning Northeast Conference Rookie of the Week honors five times this season. But the junior is playing very well for a 14-5 Delsea squad, especially at the defensive end. \n\"As the point guard you have to set the tone for the rest of the team,\" he said. \"If I go hard, the rest of the guys will see that and follow through. If I come out lackadaisical, they might think it's OK. So I have to bring it out and show my team what to do.\" \n• Highland junior Dante Masino , who has missed the last six games with torn ligaments in his ankle, is expected to return Tuesday against Hammonton , coach Joe Lewis said. He is averaging 17 points and 10 rebounds per game. \nIn other injury news, Delsea welcomed back senior Kamel Morton on Saturday against Vineland . He had missed 10 games with a back injury. \nMorton, who is averaging 12.2 points per game, came off the bench in the 63-42 victory and scored three points, all on free throws. \n\"He's only gotten a couple of practices in,\" Delsea coach Tom Freeman said. \"We've won a lot of games without him, so you don't want to break the chemistry. But we'll find a way to get him back in the flow and it will be a gradual progression until we get to the tournament.\" \n• Woodstown junior forward Jawan Roane , who missed the first 11 games of the season with a knee injury, looked like his old self this past week. He followed up a 24-point performance against Glassboro with 28 points and 13 rebounds in a two-point loss to Highland. \n• Millville brings a 13-3 record into a challenging week that includes road games at Atlantic City and Egg Harbor before an interesting non-league game at home against Gloucester Catholic. \n• Sterling is on a four-game winning streak that includes a 58-55 victory over Paulsboro . The Silver Knights are 11-8 on the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:28:15.866+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
