I remember looking at it last year and thinking we should have had him in it, so we always planned after the King George to come straight for this. Basically we just want to keep him going and I don't want him standing around for too long. He doesn't need three months between races.\" \nCue Card was taken out of his comfort zone by stablemate Thistlecrack in the 32Red King George VI Chase last time out but Tizzard has been happy with his schooling since. \nHe said: \"He's been brilliant and, while he may not have run his complete race at Kempton, he was still better than the rest of them. He met Thistlecrack on his very best form and there's still a question mark whether this isn't his best trip.\" \nWhatever the result at Ascot - where Cue Card will face a maximum of six rivals headed by Kylemore Lough and course specialist Royal Regatta - Tizzard says the book has been closed on the debate over Cue Card's Cheltenham target, which remains the Gold Cup. \nHe said: \"That isn't why he's going to Ascot. Jean Bishop has always dreamed of winning the Gold Cup with this horse and he missed out last year, so we'll have another go this year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T16:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:11:01.399+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
