Sarah Ann Harris News Reporter, The Huffington Post UK \nThe United States has been suffering from division and disunity recently but this year’s Superbowl featured plenty of moments which showcased the country’s spirit of inclusivity and celebrated diversity. \nThe Superbowl is one of the biggest sporting events of the year in the US (and perhaps even the world) and this year saw the New England Patriots launch a stunning comeback to beat the Atlana Falcons 34-28. TIMOTHY A. CLARY via Getty Images The New England Patriots beat the Atlana Falcons 34-28 \nBut the American Football competition isn’t just about the sport - it’s also well-known for the adverts shown during the game and its half-time show, this year performed by Lady Gaga . \nThis year’s Superbowl seemed to focus on fighting back after what was a particularly divisive presidential campaign. \nHere were some of the best moments... Airbnb’s message of acceptance \nThe company has already taken a stand against Donald Trump’s travel ban on people from seven Muslim majority countries by offering free accommodation to anyone affected. \nSo it’s of no surprise that Airbnb’s ad was all about accepting people no matter what. Okay, @Airbnb , I see your ad and I'm feelin' the love. Well done. #weaccept \nThis building supply store’s ‘banned’ ad ending \nLumber 84’s ad featured a Spanish-speaking mother and daughter apparently traveling from Mexico to the United States. \nThe end, which shows the pair discovering a door in a giant wall, was reportedly banned from TV since it commented on President Donald Trump ’s promised border wall. \nIt ended with the line “the will to succeed is always welcome here”. \nLumber 84’s site crashed last night as people flocked to watch the full video. 84 Lumber is choosing to be on the right side of history. Thank you for standing up for what you believe. — Bailey Patterson (@BaileyPatterso5) February 6, 2017 To anyone who missed the point of the 84 Lumber commercial, it was simple and uncontroversial. Illegal immigrants are humans. — #NeverTrump #Ex-GOP (@Trump_Truther) February 6, 2017 \nCoca Cola’s ‘America The Beautiful’ ad Our diversity is our strength. America The Beautiful #SuperBowl #Coke pic.twitter.com/vhEBvJQ38d — Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) February 6, 2017 \nThe advert featured a wide range of people singing the famous song in different languages and ended with the declarations “together is beautiful”. \nMany people applauded the ad on social media... Coca Cola airs a moving Super Bowl ad celebrating our nations incredible diversity. Loved it. — Kevin Negandhi (@KNegandhiESPN) February 5, 2017 Coca-Cola, I applaud your sensitivity to the healing that our country needs right now!!! Excellently done!!! #SuperBowl — Herman L. Dickey (@HDfromMT) February 5, 2017 That Coca-Cola commercial featuring two dads, and a multi racial America tho 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼 Can't wait to see Trump explode on that. #SuperBowl — Maxwell Ammerman (@Teh_Bandyt) February 5, 2017 Audi’s fightback against sexism Progress is for everyone. At Audi, we are committed to equal pay for equal work. #DriveProgress pic.twitter.com/pF0t14ido8 \nThis ad, featuring a young girl with some seriously good driving skills, featured a father questioning whether he would have to explain to his daughter about the gender pay gap. \nAudi has said it is “committed to equal pay for equal work”. We see you #Audi great commercial — octavia spencer (@octaviaspencer) February 6, 2017 Audi, thank your for reminding us that everyone is created equal and should be treated & valued as an equal! Great commercial @Audi_Online \nThis haircare brand’s Trump trolling \nIt’s A 10 warned that Americans are in for four years of “awful hair” - so encouraged them to fight back with their own, whatever their chosen style may be (and yes that includes facial hair, chest hair and even back hair). I just love that the commercial started with, \"America... we're in for 4 years of awful hair.\" 😂 and I love #itsa10 💁 — Brittni Maurer (@bmau13) February 6, 2017 \"We are in for 4 years of awful hair\"....Y THEY CAME AT TRUMP's HAIR — #FireBK (@mr_jt412) February 6, 2017 Budweiser’s immigrant tale \nThis tells the story of the beer brand’s co-founder Adolphus Busch’s journey to America from Germany in 1857. \nSome Trump supporters have even called for a boycott of the beer brand over the ad. \nThe love was far strong though... #boycottbudwiser Alt Right can't even spell what they're boycotting. More for me, looks like I'll be stocking up on budweiser, nice work!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T16:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T11:12:57.177+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
