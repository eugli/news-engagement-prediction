Lokesh Waghmare tried to alight from a moving express train in Vasai when he slipped and fell on the tracks, and was crushed to death. \nMumbai Mirror \nConfirming the incident Vasai GRP Mahesh Bagwe informed that the incident happened when Waghmare tried to get down from a Swaraj Express that slowed down in Vasai. \nWaghmare was on his way back home from Vadodara.
