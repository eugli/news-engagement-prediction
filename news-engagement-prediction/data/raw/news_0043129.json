PA Real Life Jennifer delivering her wedding speech. \n“For years I never thought I would or could have a baby, as I was so afraid of passing my problems on to them,” she said. \n“But having overcome my stammer to read my vows in front of so many people, I know I can teach our little girl her first words too.” \nIn her personally written vows, in March 2015, Jennifer told husband Ashley, 29: “You are my one true love and I’m so lucky I found you.” \nThe new mum, of Coulby Newham, Middlesbrough, faced playground bullies and felt suicidal during her 18-year battle with the speech problem. \nBut after meeting kind sales executive Ashley and enrolling on a speech therapy course, she finally said the words she never thought she would: “I do”. \n“Getting married was something I always told myself I didn’t want to do. I couldn’t say my own name, how was I meant to say my vows never mind bring up a child?” she said. \n“But Ashley convinced me I wanted to get married and I realised I should take the opportunity to stand up in front of all the people I love and give a speech – because I finally could. \n“I was more nervous about the speech than actually getting married. But I was so glad I did it. It was something I never even dreamed of.” \nBreaking with tradition, by giving a reception speech, Jennifer effortlessly commanded the room, telling jokes and teasing her new husband. \nAshley was brimming with pride during the moving 10-minute address. \nHe said: “I knew how much speaking in front of everyone on our big day meant to her, so it was amazing to see.” PA Real Life Jennifer with her husband Ashley and their baby Edith. \nJennifer first developed a speech condition aged five, after her parents’ marriage broke down. \nDuring high school she faced bullies who teased her and by the time she reached Teeside University, there were days when she did not even speak for fear of being ridiculed. \nEven the simplest tasks, like booking a doctor’s appointment or ordering food in a restaurant, filled her with dread. \nSome days she couldn’t say her name and even thought about ending her own life, through frustration. \nJennifer feared her dream of becoming an occupational therapist would fall apart if she didn’t face her speech problem fast. \nShe tried speech therapies and hypnotherapy, but nothing worked, until her mum Susan Golden, 57, suggested a course in Scotland. \nSo, in October 2010 she joined the McGuire Programme, which put her on the road to recovery. \nThrough developing breathing techniques, practicing public speaking and looking at psychological factors over the past five years, the McGuire Programme has transformed Jennifer’s life. \nAnd a year after joining, she met her now-husband, Ashley. \nIronically, they got talking after he started imitating people with stammers – unaware of Jennifer’s struggle with the condition. \nBut in March 2015 the pair tied the knot at luxurious Rockliffe Hall, near Darlington. \nBut Jennifer made one promise to herself – she would read her own vows and make a speech at the reception afterwards. \nAnd after her proud mum Susan, a nurse, gave her away, Jennifer faced her fears. \n“As the time approached to talk in front of everyone I couldn’t eat and felt so sick… but when I was up there I just felt so happy,” she said. \n“All the men were crying! I just felt so proud of myself to be able to do that, to push myself, in front of everyone.” \nTalking fluently can still be a challenge for Jennifer, but thanks to the love and support of her husband and help from speech experts, she now relishes chatting to anyone. \nAnd she also wants to help others with speech difficulties, and has trained to become a coach and instructor at the McGuire Programme. \n“I used to feel so small, so embarrassed and ashamed. I was an adult and yet I couldn’t even say my own name. It was humiliating,” she said. \n“But I’m not scared anymore.” SEE ALSO:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T17:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:57:59.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
