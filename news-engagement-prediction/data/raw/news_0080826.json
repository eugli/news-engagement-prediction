But the command is always impressive from where I was concerned.\" \nThe team has been taking it slower with Greinke than the other pitchers this spring, allowing him to help design his schedule. \nWhether Greinke next appears in a Cactus League game or throws another live batting practice session has not been announced. Greinke throwing at own pace Lovullo talks Greinke throwing at his own pace D-backs manager Torey Lovullo discusses Zack Greinke's latest bullpen session and allowing him to make his own adjustments \n\"What I've been saying all along is that we're going to give Zack a little bit of flexibility in knowing what it takes for him to get ready for the start of the season,\" Lovullo said. \"At this point in time, we're going to let him tell us how he feels and move forward day by day based on the information that he's giving us. For me, he's spot on. He's not behind in any way, shape or form. He feels great. But [Tuesday] we'll probably have more details on what the next steps are.\" has covered the D-backs for MLB.com since 2001. Follow him on Twitter @SteveGilbertMLB .
