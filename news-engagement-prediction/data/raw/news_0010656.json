This is what we do and don't know about the refugee resettlement deal between the US and Australia. \nFor several years Lieutenant General Campbell served in the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet as head of the Office of National Security â€” and then rose to public prominence as the first Commander of Operation Sovereign Borders. \nOn Wednesday the Army Chief is due to meet senior Indonesian military figures following last month's breakdown in defence relations. \nDefence Minister Marise Payne would not be drawn on whether the Government would give the Army Chief any future diplomatic challenges. \n\"I don't think I want to make predictive statements about the future of Lieutenant General Campbell's interests and career life,\" Senator Payne told the ABC. \n\"He is an exceptional Chief of Army and I enjoy upmost faith in him and enjoy working with him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T20:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T16:13:21.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
