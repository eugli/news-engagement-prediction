So if you’re sick of drafts and high heating bills, it might be time to help your home “bundle up” by learning how to insulate an attic (or add more of the stuff to bulk up).\nHow much does it cost to insulate an attic? On average, hiring a contractor to install insulation onto the floor of your attic will cost $1,343.
