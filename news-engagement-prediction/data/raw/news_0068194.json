Source: 7 Sport Steve Smith's incredible century on Day Three \nIt's far too early to suggest Australia will record the nation's second Test series win in India since 1970, but Smith's century in Pune has left them incredibly well placed to complete their first Test win in India since 2004. \nSmith posted his 10th - and arguably most important - Test ton as captain of Australia on day three of the absorbing contest. \n\"That's as good a Test hundred as he's scored in his career to date. Australia are in an extremely dominant position because of that innings,\" former Australian captain Michael Clarke said on Star Sports. Smith's century was one of his gutsiest. Pic: AAP \n\"No matter what conditions are or where he is in the world, he adapts and finds a way. This innings has been very important in the context of not only this Test but the series.\" \nIndia's sloppy fielding also helped. Kohli struggled to contain his rage as Smith was dropped on 23, 29, 37 and 67. Jayant Yadav missed a chance to run the skipper out on 60. \nKohli and his teammates also straddled the line of dissent after a couple of confident appeals were turned down, including when Smith should have been given out lbw on 73.

Smith was in his element as he hammered home Australia's advantage on a spinner's paradise produced with the world's two best bowlers in mind. \nStar spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja both had their moments against the classy right-hander, with the latter finally dismissing him after 260 minutes at the crease. \nSmith celebrated heartily upon reaching three figures. It was his 18th Test hundred, but the roar had more to do with the captain's desperation to snap a nine-Test losing streak in Asia.
