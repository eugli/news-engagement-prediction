The 45-year-old Today show co-anchor shared a cute pic of herself cradling her son on Wednesday, going makeup-free and looking flawless. Guthrie noted she's returning to her NBC morning show duties on March 3, after taking a break following the birth of Charley in December. \"Hey, little one, you're not the *only* good reason to wake up early!!\" she Instagrammed. \"I'm headed back to @TODAYshow March 3!

The journalist previously reflected on how maternity leave has affected her after the birth of Vale in August 2014. \"The best part about being on maternity leave is just having the days stretch out in front of me and I have only one thing to do, and that's to take care of this little baby,\" Guthrie told Today about her time off. \"Even though being a mom is the most challenging thing I've ever tried to do, I've never felt more exhilarated and relaxed and peaceful and joyous -- even on those nights when she's waking up every couple of hours. I just feel thankful.\" \"I hope that I'm going to take this new found patience and calm and bring it back with me to work and to the craziness of this big and exciting job,\" she added. \"It's changed me in every way.\" Of course, Guthrie isn't the only new mom in the Today show family.
