It demands closer inspection\". \nScroll down to see a selection of some of the best images from each category. \nNigel McCall - 1st Place \nAberglasney Gardens, Carmarthenshire, Wales, UK Image copyright Nigel McCall \nJudges' comments \nPhilip Smith, founder of International Garden Photographer of the Year: \n\"This is a classical composition with the bridge leading us into the garden and its wonderful display of October colour. The angle of view is very precisely aligned, creating the feeling of serene calm.\" \nClare Foggett, Editor of the English Garden Magazine: \n\"It has a calm, almost Eastern zen-like quality. The autumn leaves on the handrail could have been artfully placed there by a stylist, but the fact that they had been spontaneously placed there by children visiting the garden earlier seems to add even more serendipity to the image.\" \nCathy Cooper - Finalist \nWindamere Hotel, Darjeeling, West Bengal, India Image copyright Cathy Cooper ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T19:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T14:52:29.181+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
