(CBC)\nThe department also said it wants to make it an offence to abandon animals, something that has not been covered by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act.\nThe release did not say what the penalties would be for any of the offences it cited, but Turner said they would likely involve fines. In some cases, judges have prohibited people from owning animals for several years or for a lifetime, depending on the offence, he said.\nLiability protection for officers The SPCA requested \"good-faith\" legislation protecting its officers from being sued for taking actions against animal cruelty, said Turner, and the government did mention liability protection among the proposed amendments.\n\"It doesn't eliminate the possibility of civil action â€¦ but it raises the bar a bit,\" said Turner.\nLast year, the society had to lay off its executive director, Hilary Howes, and make other cuts after it faced increased costs and more public demand for animal protection services. (CBC)\nHe added that with the $100,000 from the province this year, and a commitment to continued annual funding \"at that level,\" the SPCA would be able to provide better services.\nLast year, after having to make staff and other cuts, the society faced increased costs because of more public demand for animal protection services.\nNew Brunswick SPCA lays off executive director Dog tethering rules take a bite out of SPCA budget \"So this new grant will make it possible for us to re-examine those measure and see what can be done to put us on a firmer financial footing,\" said Turner.\nThe Department of Environment and Local Government could not be reached for comment Monday.\nThe news release said the amendments came from consulting with animal welfare stakeholders and monitoring legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\"It became clear that we needed to strengthen our laws and we needed to ensure the society had access to stable funding to enforce the legislation and continue their important role of education and awareness,\" the minister, Serge Rousselle, said in the release.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T03:17:33.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
