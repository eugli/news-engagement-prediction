Comprised of five positions, the squad is selected based on games and performances from the week prior. Let’s get to this week's edition: \nG: Justin Robinson | Monmouth \nIs this the season Monmouth breaks back into the NCAA tournament? \nThe Hawks clinched their second-straight MAAC regular season crown Thursday behind a 27-point, four-assist outing against Niagra from their star point guard, Robinson. He finished 7-of-9 from 3-point range. And that wasn’t even his best performance of the week. \nThree days earlier against Siena, Robinson exploded for a season-high 40 points in a 102-82 victory. The shifty 5-foot-8 guard was one of four Hawks to reach double figures and added six rebounds and three assists. . @MonmouthBBall 's Justin Robinson had a career-high 40 points last night against Siena. #FlyHawks pic.twitter.com/c6Fq9O2sWn — Mon Digital Network (@MDigitalNetwork) February 14, 2017 \nMonmouth is on a roll, winning its last 13 games, and Robinson (19.9 points per game) is largely to thank. He’s now reached the 20-point mark in 10 of his last 11 outings and has the Hawks primed for a run at their first conference tournament title and NCAA tournament appearance since 2006. \nG: Khadeen Carrington | Seton Hall \nIt was a good week for guards out of the Garden State. I n consecutive games against ranked Big East foes, Carrington dropped 41 points on No. 20 Creighton and 22 against No. 2 Villanova. Vincent Carchietta | USA TODAY Sports Images Khadeen Carrington scored 41 points in Seton Hall's upset over Creighton. The junior relentlessly drove to the rim in Wednesday’s 87-81 upset over the Bluejays, getting to the free throw line 11 times, finishing 18-of-22 from the stripe. He added five rebounds, seven assists and just a single turnover in an all-around effort.\nHe didn’t get to the line quite as often against the Wildcats Saturday, but Carrington still managed a 7-of-16 outing from the field with two rebounds, two assists and a steal in a 92-70 loss. \nF: Mike Daum | South Dakota State \nCentral Michigan’s Marcus Keene (30.2 points per game) has had a stronghold on the scoring title for the majority of the season, but Daum is slowly creeping up (24.8). \nDaum went off for 51 points against Fort Wayne Saturday on 14-of-29 shooting, marking his ninth game this season with at least 30 points. His 15 rebounds added to the cause. He now has seven double-doubles for the year. \nThe sophomore used his 6-foot-9 frame to battle for points in the post, get to the free throw line (where he shot 16-of-17) and find success from outside (7-of-18 from 3-point range). \nDaum’s outing was just the second instance in the past 20 years -- and first since 2006 -- in which a player recorded at least 50 points and 15 rebounds. \nHe was no slouch on Wednesday either, when he put up 26 points and nine rebounds in a win over IUPUI. \nF: John Collins | Wake Forest \nIt was an 0-2 week for the Demon Deacons, but Collins’ individual work cannot be overlooked. \nThe 6-foot-10 forward powered his way to back-to-back career-highs in points and double-doubles against Duke and Clemson to continue a remarkable 10-game run of 20+-point performances. Mark Dolejs | USA TODAY Sports Images John Collins scored a career-high 31 against Duke on Saturday afternoon. In Saturday’s near upset over Duke, Collins put up a season-high 31 points to go along with 15 rebounds. Four days earlier in a Tuesday night matchup with Clemson, Collins shined again with 29 points, 10 rebounds and two blocks.\nFor the week, Collins shot an astounding 78 percent while staying mostly in or around the paint. Neither performance was ultimately enough to knock off the Blue Devils or Tigers, as Wake Forest’s defense gave up 99 and 95 points. \nF: Lauri Markkanen | Arizona \nThe previous two weeks weren’t anything to brag about for Markkanen, Arizona’s freshman from Finland — he went four straight games without reaching double figures in either points or rebounds. \nThis week was a different story. \nMarkkanen was the catalyst in both of the Wildcats’ resounding wins this week against a pair of programs from the Evergreen state. . @APlayersProgram 's Lauri Markkanen brought the HEAT tonight vs Washington, totaling 26 points! pic.twitter.com/sGGKwTdnKj — Pac-12 Network (@Pac12Network) February 19, 2017 \nThe 7-footer scored a team-high 26 points and added 13 rebounds and two steals in Arizona’s 76-68 win over Washingtonon Saturday night. The score was tied at the half, but Markkanen led a second-half surge with eight points. \nOn Thursday, Markkanen put up 19 points and added 11 rebounds in a 78-59 victory over Washington State. \nThe Wildcats remain in No. 1 in a tight three-way race for the Pac-12 title.
