And just when it seemed he would stack a few dozen offers before his senior season, he put an end to his recruitment.\nAs it turns out, Florida was the offer for which the young cornerback was waiting. He announced his quick decision with a tweet\nBlessed to say that I'm Committed to the Florida Gators! üêäüêä #AllBite18 @UFRC_JH @RLS2294 @CoachMcElwain pic.twitter.com/zwDikVcQ9i\n‚Äî Divaad Wilson¬Æ (@NikemanNewt) February 4, 2017 The decision, it seems, was designed to send a message. According to Wilson, he‚Äôs a player that knows what he wants. He saw his recent offer from UF as a opportunity and wasted no time in seizing it.\nI was waiting for [a Florida offer], but I wasn't rushing it,‚Äù Wilson said. ‚ÄúIt's a big opportunity that I can't pass on.\nI had to jump on board early to let coach know i'm not playing.\nWilson visited Florida for the Gators‚Äô game against South Carolina this fall and was further sold on the program at that juncture.\n‚ÄúIt was a great atmosphere up there,‚Äù Wilson said.\nWilson attends Miami Northwestern High School. He was one of the most impressive prospects at South Florida Express tryouts a week ago.\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/UFRC_JH", "https://twitter.com/RLS2294", "https://twitter.com/CoachMcElwain", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/qo5dlj7zkrbsdj3whgnp", "https://twitter.com/NikemanNewt/status/827714892090187776", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/AllBite18?src=hash", "https://res-5.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/qo5dlj7zkrbsdj3whgnp)", "https://t.co/zwDikVcQ9i"], "published": "2017-02-04T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:16:19.647+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
