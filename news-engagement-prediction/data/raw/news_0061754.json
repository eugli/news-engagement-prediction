Friedman Theater in Manhattan, where he is starring in August Wilson’s play “Jitney.” Credit Demetrius Freeman for The New York Times André Holland can currently be seen acting in three highly praised projects: the Oscar-nominated film “ Moonlight ”; the Broadway debut of August Wilson’s play “ Jitney ,” which had its premiere in 1982; and the Cinemax series “ The Knick .” So it goes without saying that what he really wants to do is produce. Mr. Holland, 37, who grew up in Alabama, recently optioned “ All God’s Dangers: The Life of Nate Shaw ,” which won a National Book Award in 1975, and Onaje X. O. Woodbine’s “ Black Gods of the Asphalt: Religion, Hip-Hop and Street Basketball .” He recently moved from SoHo to Fort Greene, Brooklyn. FIRST THOUGHT Usually coffee. I’m a big coffee drinker, so I get up and make a nice hot cup of coffee. I’m usually up by about 7:30. I don’t sleep much these days. CALORIES OUT, CALORIES IN I like to go to the gym in the morning, so I’ll pop over there and do a quick workout. Come back, and I’m a big breakfast person. There’s a little cafe in the West Village called Buvette that does a really delicious waffle sandwich that I’m somewhat obsessed with.

I grew up going to church every Sunday, but lately I’ve not been going as much. TAKE THE A TRAIN And then it’s time for me to head off to the theater, so I get there by 12:45. I’m on that A train. \nAdvertisement   FUEL UP I’ll stop at Green Symphony on 43rd Street. It’s kind of the spot for a lot of Broadway actors. I usually grab a smoothie before the show and inevitably run into some friends who are headed to their matinees. Photo Because the theater does not have a crossover backstage, Mr. Holland must run in front of the theater to make a stage entrance. “My little two-minute breaks are usually spent sprinting around the theater,” he said. Credit Demetrius Freeman for The New York Times FIGHT There’s a little bit of violence in the play, so before every show we go through the fight. It’s kind of a safety check, so nobody gets hurt. SET THE MOOD I have a vocal warm-up and a physical warm-up, to make sure I’m stretched out and connected to my breath. Then I listen to music as well. I made a playlist from the period, the ’70s, that really speaks to me. The very first song is “ I Think I’ll Call It Morning ” by Gil Scott-Heron. KEEP IT FRESH I hear new parts of the play all the time, things that I thought I understood. And the actors are constantly evolving their part, so it’s never the same, so you have to be on your toes. The only down part is that there come days when you’re tired, maybe a bit bored. I have to find something to put my attention on, some particular part of the character or the play, so I don’t fall into just doing it by memory. It’s a journey you have to take every night, and sometimes you don’t feel like taking that journey. But then the play starts, and usually those performances that you dread doing end up being the most interesting ones. Tired actors are often the best actors.

Credit Demetrius Freeman for The New York Times SIDEWALK HUSTLE We don’t have a crossover backstage — we can’t cross from stage right to stage left. A lot of times I’ll go offstage right and then have to enter stage left, which means I have to go out on 47th Street and run in front of the theater and come back in on the other side. So my little two-minute breaks are usually spent sprinting around the theater. SOCIAL HOUR I usually have people who have come, and we’ll go and grab lunch or a drink someplace. I work with a lot of students, so I’ll speak to them afterwards before they get back on the bus. SPORTS, SCRIPTS I usually like to unwind. I’ll go see a movie, or I love sports, so I’ll just come home and catch up on my ESPN. Then I’ll inevitably have to catch up on some work — for example, reading scripts that I am not able to get to during the week. EASY FIXINGS Usually I’ll either order in or make dinner at home. Mostly I order in, because I’m too tired to cook at that point. CRASH Nine times out of 10 I fall asleep on the couch with a script open or an email half done. I sleep on the couch pretty much every night, which is bizarre to a lot of people. The couch is kind of my favorite place.
