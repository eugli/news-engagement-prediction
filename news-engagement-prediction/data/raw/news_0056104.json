'Desperately careful' \nHope not Hate said it wanted the Electoral Commission and Kent Police to investigate alleged \"flouting of electoral law\" by UKIP. \nThe left-leaning pressure group said South Thanet candidates were allowed to spend £15,087.30 in an election period between 9 April and 7 May, but UKIP spent at least £26,000. \nIt said its investigation found campaign staff, billboards and mobile ad-vans were omitted from the South Thanet electoral returns.

But even so, it is not registered anywhere that I was paid that much.\" \nThe BBC checked returns signed off by Mr Farage and his election agent and was unable to find any entry that matched the payment. \nThe BBC has also spoken to three young activists who confirmed they were paid to work in South Thanet but it is unclear where their salaries have been declared. \nUKIP has said it is confident it complied with all electoral regulations, but the party declined a further interview with BBC South East. \nUnder election spending rules, parliamentary candidates are limited to a maximum of £8,700 pounds plus up to nine pence for every registered voter, which gave a maximum spend in South Thanet of £15,087. \nOverspending, or knowingly not declaring costs, can lead to criminal sanctions.
