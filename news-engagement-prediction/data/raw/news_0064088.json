Millennials are not as selfish as you might think   13:02 Get short URL © David Oxberry / www.globallookpress.com Millennials are less likely to switch jobs from year to year than the previous generation, and are missing out on the financial gains that come with high job mobility. \nA report by the Resolution Foundation has found that only four percent of those who reached working age at the start of the 2000s have frequently changed jobs.

The high level of job loyalty displayed by millennials debunks the myth that they are job-hoppers who only care about making a quick buck. \nThe findings are all the more surprising because loyalty comes at a considerable cost. \nThe current level of inflation has led to a drop in real wages for the long-term employed. \n“ With the typical pay rise for a job mover in their mid-20s at around 15 per cent and evidence that employers have essentially stopped rewarding their long-serving staff with real annual pay increases, such job loyalty can be very costly, ” said Laura Gardiner, a senior analyst at the Resolution Foundation. \nOne explanation for the decline in job-hopping among millennials is the 2008 global financial crisis and the ensuing lack of job security. \nGardiner noted that the proliferation of temporary work and zero-hour contracts in the post-crisis environment explains the reluctance of millennials to leave their full-time jobs, despite the financial disadvantages.
