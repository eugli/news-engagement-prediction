Don’t make it out like I’m crying and sooking about the fight, that wasn’t even about the fight,” Mundine said.\n“My dear friend Michael Dickie — he’s one of my best fans from the get go, he’s been to pretty much every one of my fights — he embraced me and spoke with conviction. He said, ‘Man, you saved my life, you saved my life’.\n“This guy went through depression, he was going to commit suicide.\n“He said to me, ‘If it wasn’t for you Choc, I wouldn’t be here. You saved my life man’.\n“When he said that to me I was like, ‘Damn, you got me man’. I couldn’t hold back the tears.”\nDuring the fight, Mundine raised the ire of fight fans by hitting Green with an illegal punch in the opening round. Green has since gone on record saying he was concussed after copping the blow, but Mundine rubbished that talk.\n“I think Danny’s going over the top with it because he wants to give himself every opportunity (to make his victory seem more impressive),” Mundine said.\n“You watch the professional soccer players play, they get kicked in the shins and go down for two or three minutes. It reminded me of something like that.\n“The theatrics he went on with, for me it was a bit funny.”\nIn the same interview, The Man also took aim at Green for suggesting the former league star’s father admitted Mundine lost the fight.\n“That’s some bulls*** man, that’s some bulls***.”\nMUNDINE: ‘B***H GREEN ‘TALKING S***’\nmedia_camera Mundine is adamant he won the fight.\nThe saga that is the game of verbal table tennis between Anthony Mundine and Danny Green just keeps dragging on.\nAfter revelations Mundine was appealing Green’s majority points win, the West Australian labelled the ex-St George Illawarra Dragon a “poor sport” who showed “disgraceful sportsmanship”.\nOn Sunday, Mundine posted on Facebook to say Green was “talking s***” as he called for yet another rematch.\n“I went up 13kg come off major hip surgery was inactive for nearly a year & half ... I won the fight but got unjust verdict ... he talking all this s*** let’s just have a 3rd & I guarantee a KO his b***h ass #mundinevgreen3 #ifthep***ydares #hisabum,” Mundine wrote.\nMundine won the first bout between the two in Sydney in 2006, but Green got his revenge at Adelaide Oval in a fight that went the full 10 rounds. Since his win he’s poured cold water on any notion of another fight to complete a mouth-watering trilogy, but Mundine isn’t so willing to accept his latest defeat.\nHis camp appealed the result — scored 94-94, 96-94 and 98-90 in Green’s favour — because of concerns over the way it was scored, penalties imposed on Mundine during the contest and claims of bias among the judges.\nmedia_camera Green emerged the happier after the fight.\nSpeaking on Perth radio station Mix 94.5 last week, Green said he wasn’t surprised Mundine chose to go down this path .\n“All it is is an appeal, it doesn’t mean anything’s going to happen,” Green said. “I expect nothing less from such a poor sport.\n“He showed disgraceful sportsmanship in the ring and I expect nothing less from someone of his character — his poor character — after the fight.”\nGreen also called Mundine’s early punch a “dog shot” that prevented him from dominating the fight.\n“I’m just disappointed not to carry it out how I felt for the first 30-45 seconds. I felt very confident he was s****ing himself — you could see the look in his eyes,” Green said.\n“I hit him with a couple of clean shots, I felt sharp early, then he threw that dog shot and it just changed the game.\n“It was just a disgraceful foul, it was incredible that he did it.”\nIf the Australian National Boxing Federation agrees to hear Mundine’s appeal, three independent local judges will be locked into three separate rooms with videos of the fight and new scorecards. Their score counts will determine if Green’s win stands.\nOriginally published as Real reason Mundine broke down", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/53eaabae0369418fe714ba994eafc290?width=650", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/boxing/mundine-lodges-protest-over-green-decision/news-story/4f74f115950a491abf7bdc01017393d7", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/article/566c80d117108512c75663d0577d090b?esi=true&t_template=s3/chronicle-tg_tlc_storybody/index&t_product=DailyTelegraph&td_device=desktop", "http://www.news.com.au/sport/boxing/anthony-mundine-continues-his-postfight-attack-on-danny-green/news-story/566c80d117108512c75663d0577d090b", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5d5381808eaff2e4188821980802cdf0?width=650"], "published": "2017-02-12T18:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T11:30:04.598+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
