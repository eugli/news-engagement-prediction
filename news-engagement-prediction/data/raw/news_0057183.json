Live updates and reaction to Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons \nAlso during Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May praised the husband of murdered Labour MP Jo Cox and said a planned series of \"get-together\" events he is championing to mark the first anniversary of her death would be a \"fitting tribute\". \nAnd she said ministers were looking at how \"appropriate relief\" could be provided to companies that were losing out from the revaluation of business rates. \nIn response to Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, Mrs May said she recognised there were \"particular concerns\" as a result of the changes, which come in on 1 April. \nThe government has faced a mounting campaign, including from some Conservative MPs, against the move.
