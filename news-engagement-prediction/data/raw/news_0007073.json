Over the years, we've played together in venues from theaters to football stadiums and everything in between. He always sets the musical bar high, his band always knocks me out and I'm thrilled we are going to spend the summer together doing a great run of concerts. This is the kind of quality and talent we both strive to present and I'm looking forward to a summer of great music, exceptional performances and fun.
