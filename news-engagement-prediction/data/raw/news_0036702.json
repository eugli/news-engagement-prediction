This was how Clinton answered that question: Hillary on the enemies she's proud to have made: \"The NRA, health insurance companies, drug companies, the Iranians…and the Republicans.\" \n— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 14, 2015 \nWhen asked about that remark last year, Clinton said that Republicans have said “terrible things about me, much worse than anything I’ve ever said about them.” \nHenry––filling in for Tucker Carlson tonight––acknowledged it wasn’t quite the same thing, but did find that reference to her political opponents as enemies of hers rather notable. \nJessica Tarlov said Clinton’s past remark was not advisable, but said that’s not comparable to Trump’s tweet going after the press today. \nWatch above, via Fox News. \n[ image via screengrab ]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:54:38.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
