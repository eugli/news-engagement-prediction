(@soIoucity) February 21, 2017 \nAdding fuel to the fire, Pistons center Andre Drummond , who Detroit has considered trading , retweeted Thomas and then posted his own two-eyes emoji tweet: ðŸ‘€ â€” Andre Drummond (@AndreDrummond) February 21, 2017 \nDrummond may just be playing around, but Thomas tweeted the two eyes emoji over the summer right before the Celtics signed Al Horford , so there is precedent as to why Celtics fans freaked out like they did. Also, because of Thomasâ€™ tweet reporters began to reach out to the Celtics to see if a potential deal was in the works. This led to Celtics assistant general manager Mike Zarren to crack a joke about Thomasâ€™ emoji use. Life in 2017: A player randomly tweets ðŸ‘€ and ~20 reporters instantly txt or call you demanding to know when the trade is happening. Lol. â€” Mike Zarren (@mikezarren) February 21, 2017 \nZarren doesnâ€™t deny that a trade is or could be happening, so his joke hasnâ€™t quelled Celtics fansâ€™ angst and anticipation. But likely nothing will keep Celtics fans and the rest of the NBA world calm until the Feb. 23 trade deadline passes. Until then the rumors, reports and cryptic tweets will keep fueling speculation.
