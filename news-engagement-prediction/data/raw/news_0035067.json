The Indian boy has made us proud with his BAFTA win this year. With a phenomenal performance in Lion and despite all the competition in the industry, Dev’s name shone at the BAFTA awards as he accepted his trophy. He was literally falling short of words and it was pretty evident in his speech. The actor, who has also bagged an Academy Awards nomination as Best Actor in a Supporting Role, took home the Brit award, for the very first time. An ecstatic Patel couldn’t really get the right words to help him express his delight for emerging victorious. The actor started his speech, “Wow. That just happened. (laughs) Words, words, words, um, oh my god, this is so overwhelming.” It really was. When you see the video, you’ll know that the actor was slightly trembling and churning out words so he can deliver a good speech. \nThe kind of competition that he had to go through, this certainly is a matter of pride! With nominations such as Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Hugh Grant, Jeff Bridges and Mahershala Ali, it certainly is a big deal. Perhaps that could be one of the reasons why Patel took time to digest the fact that he did bag the trophy. You can check out his acceptance speech below.

There was a very good competition that the Damien Chazelle movie faced from Manchester By The Sea and Lion, who took home quite a few awards. Lion has won Best Screenplay as well as Best Supporting Actor. With this, hopes have surely shot up for Academy Awards as it nears! It would be such a killer moment to see Dev take away his first Oscar trophy too, don’t you think? Damn, we can’t wait for this to happen! Anyway, the complete list of BAFTA awards 2017 is out so check it out here! \nHow happy are you with Dev Patel’s big win at BAFTA, Bollywoodlifers? Tell us in the comments section below.
