But if he needs a day or two off or manager Brian Snitker decides that Freeman benefit from a rest, then who?\nThe leading options are right fielder Nick Markakis, an 11-year veteran with five career starts at first base, including one last season, and utility man Chase d’Arnaud, who said he hasn’t played first base since he was 12 years old, but is eager to give it a go. The Braves had him pick up a first baseman’s mitt and start to take some ground balls and throws at first base Saturday in the team’s first full-squad workout.\nJace Peterson is another option for first base, but the Braves already expect to use him plenty as a backup at other positions, including second base, third base and possibly center field and shortstop. Catcher Tyler Flowers also has some experience at first base.\n“We had Chase out there working today, wanting him to familiarize himself with that position,” Braves manager Brian Snitker said. “A guy like that with good hands, it shouldn’t be a problem. Or Nick did it last week when Freddie had a (day out of lineup) and did a good job.”\nFreeman started 158 of the Braves’ 161 games in 2016, and started all 162 games in 2014 when he led the majors in innings played. But he played in only 118 games in an injury-plagued 2015 season and missed 15 games in each of the 2012 and 2013 seasons. So having a competent backup at first base could prove important.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T01:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T08:39:31.779+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
