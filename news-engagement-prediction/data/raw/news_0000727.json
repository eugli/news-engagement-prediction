I’m not going to pre-empt what the whip is going to recommend.” \nIt is understood the party’s leadership will look at members’ votes after three days of debate in the Commons next week over amendments to the Brexit Bill. The temporary reprieve is an unusual move by the Labour leader and far less heavy-handed than normal after MPs defy a three-line whip. \nWith shadow cabinet members already doubling up on jobs, there is speculation the delay is over a potential struggle to fill positions. \nShadow minister for London and housing Andy Slaughter MP, who voted against triggering Article 50, said the atmosphere from the party leadership has been “remarkably relaxed”. \nHe said: “If they decide to show leniency or mercy ... I’m going to wait and see. It’s business as usual until such time as they decide.” Find out how your MP voted in the Brexit debate \nOther London MPs whose membership of Mr Corbyn’s top team hangs in the balance are Catherine West, shadow foreign minister, Rupa Huq, shadow home office minister, Rosena Allin-Khan, shadow sport and culture minister, Ruth Cadbury, shadow housing minister, Lyn Brown, shadow policing minister and Vicky Foxcroft, who is a whip working for Nick Brown. \nStephen Pound, shadow Northern Ireland minister and staunch pro-Remainer, shouted “suicide” as the vote closed in the Commons last night. \nEyebrows were also raised when shadow home secretary Diane Abbott missed the vote last night just days after telling members to back the triggering of Article 50. \nA spokesperson said she was suffering from a migraine but intends to be back in the Commons on Monday to take part in three days of debate on Brexit.
