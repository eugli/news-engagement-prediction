In a picture taken on August 7, 2010 lava spews from Mount Yasur volcano in Vanuatu. One of the most accessible volcanos on Earth, the 361-metre (1,190-foot) Mount Yasur is also nearly always active -- its super-hot crater a warm glow seen from around the island. The volcano has also been known to cause a tsunami and locals live with the constant nuisance of falling ash destroying the crops they need for their survival on the island, where most still live in traditional villages. Lava spurts out from the Tungurahua volcano in Pelileo, Ecuador, on May 8, 2013. View of the Tungurahua Volcano, from Patate, Ecuador, on August 20, 2012, 135 km south of Quito. Visitors look at screens displaying images of lava erupting from Iceland's Eyjafjoell volcano at the pavilion of Iceland at the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai on May 5, 2010. Britain and Ireland were closing parts of their airspace on May 5 after a fresh cloud of ash arrived from the Icelandic volcano that caused air travel chaos in Europe in April. View of the Tungurahua Volcano throwing incandescent rocks and lava, from the town of Runtun, Ecuador, on December 4, 2011, 135 km south of Quito. Lava spewed from a crater of the giant Etna volcano in the southern Italy island of Sicily on July 30, 2011 in Catania. The lava flown into a valley overnight and did not represent a danger to inhabited areas. Etna is the highest active volcano in Europe at 3,295 metres (10,810 feet) which last eruption was in May. Lava spewed from a crater of the giant Etna volcano in the southern Italy island of Sicily on July 30, 2011 in Catania. The Tungurahua volcano erupts on May 29, 2010. The Tungurahua, in the central Andes Mountains of Ecuador, started erupting May 28, forcing the evacuation of at least seven villages and closing down the airport and public schools in Guayaquil, the country's largest and most populated city. The Tungurahua volcano spews ashes and lava on January 11, 2010, in Cotalo, Ecuador, 135km south of Quito. Aerial view taken on January 2, 2010 on the French Indian island of La Reunion, shows lava flowing out of Le Dolomieu crater of The Piton de la Fournaise volcano, one of the world's most active volcanoes. Lava cascades on the slopes of Mayon volcano in Legazpi City, Albay province, southeast of Manila late on December 24, 2009, as it continues its mild eruption. People displaced by an erupting volcano prepared for a 'White Christmas' of a different kind on December 24 as Mayon spewed ash and politicians bearing gifts trooped to evacuation centers. Aerial view from an Italian Protezione Civile helicopter shows the Stromboli volcano north of Sicily as it spews lava toward the sea, 01 March 2007, after one of Europe's most active volcanos churned into activity. Stromboli, which attracts up to 6,000 tourists every year, had recently been placed under heightened surveillance after scientists registered higher seismic readings. Lava flows from the crater of restive Mayon volcano as seen from nearby city of Legazpi, 20 August 2006. A six to eight-kilometer (four to five-mile) danger zone has been set up around the volcano and residents within the zone have been forced to seek refuge in 28 overcrowded evacuation centers.  シェア", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T09:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T06:16:03.295+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
