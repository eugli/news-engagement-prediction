Baumer hit five first-half threes, setting the table for a second-half show from Angle. By the end of regulation, the duo had accounted for 10 of their team's 13 three-pointers. Baumer finished with a game-high 19 points, while Angle added 15. \n\"It's a breakthrough game with five games left in the season,\" said Lake Oswego coach Marshall Cho. \"I think it's a great way to build momentum going into the West Linn game at home.\" \nEven with the shots falling for the Lakers, Lakeridge landed enough counter punches to stay even through four quarters. Out of the halftime break, the Pacers held Lake Oswego scoreless for more than four minutes to build a 40-31 lead. Lakeridge's full-court pressure helped rush some Lake Oswego decisions, but the Pacers could only keep the lid on the Lakers for so long. \nAfter the four-minute drought to start the third quarter, Angle's three-point barrage shocked Lake Oswego back to life. The sophomore finished with nine points -- all from long range -- in the quarter, and helped build a 14-0 scoring run for Lake Oswego. \nSenior Nate Ninteman led Lakeridge with 18 points, and junior Immanuel Allen chipped in 14. Allen's potential game-winner at the buzzer fell just short to send the game to overtime at 62-62. We've got OT at Lakeridge. Tied 62-62, Manny Allen came thissss close to a pretty amazing buzzer beater... #opreps pic.twitter.com/qUdZccHTMS â€” Pete Christopher (@PeteChristopher) February 4, 2017 \nIn overtime, Lake Oswego got a boost from senior guard Brandon Beckman on the defensive end. \n\"Brandon came in and gave us such a lift,\" Cho said. \"A guy who might not play a lot of minutes, stays ready and comes in and flies around and embraces his role ... I thought he really saved the day tonight. And from there, it was contagious.\" \nLake Oswego's win Friday brings the season series between the rival schools back even, as Lakeridge topped Lake Oswego 61-54 on Jan. 6. The Lakers (6-3) now sit a half-game above the Pacers (5-3) in the Three Rivers League standings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T15:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T09:40:28.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
