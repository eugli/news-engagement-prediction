What does the new coin look like? The coins are being made at 4,000 a minute at a Royal Mint production office in Llantrisant, Wales (Photo: PA) \nThe new coin is made of two metals, with a gold-coloured outer ring and a silver-coloured inner ring. \nIt has an image that changes from a \"£\" symbol to the number \"1\" when the coin is seen from different angles. It also has very small lettering on both sides of the coin and milled edges. \nIt is thinner and lighter than the round pound, but its diameter is slightly larger.

(Photo: eBay.co.uk) \nSpeaking to Mirror Money, Alex Cassidy, from GoCompare's Coining It In platform, described the bids as \"fascinating\" and reminiscent of the 1994 trial £2 coin that has come to \"become one of the most sought after collectable coins in Britain\". \n\"These new £1 trial coins are fascinating, especially considering the financial precedent of the £2.00 trial coins in 1994, which have since become one of the most sought after collectable coins in Britain,\" he said. \n\"The fact that people are already trying to sell them on eBay shows just how coin-mad the general public have become in the last few years. \n\"After all, if these new trial coins turn out to be as valuable as 1994’s, then anyone who gets their hands on them now could be sitting on a future goldmine.\" Read More The most valuable £1 and £2 coins - have you got any stashed away? \nTwenty five different designs have appeared on the current round pound coin, from dragons to trees, many of which are now selling online. \nRoyal Mint chief executive Adam Lawrence said there are also plans strike a billion of the new coins, which are made from two types of metal, before its launch in March. \nIt will feature the national flora of the UK’s four countries emerging from a coronet. \nDr Kevin Clancy, director of the Royal Mint Museum, said: “This year we also mark the achievements of Jane Austen, Sir Isaac Newton and The Royal Flying Corps – all pioneers in their own field. \n\"The British public should start to see these coins appearing in their change from spring 2017.\" Read More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T20:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T16:23:26.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
