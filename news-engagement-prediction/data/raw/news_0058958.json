The set, released in 2014, enters at No. 12 on the March 4-dated list, earning 29,000 equivalent album units in the week ending Feb. 16, according to Nielsen Music. The set sold 27,000 copies, all from digital downloads, with both sums up from a negligible amount in the week previous. \nThe Billboard 200 chart ranks the most popular albums of the week in the U.S. based on multi-metric consumption , which includes traditional album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). \nThe debut of I Make the Static grants Villa her first entry on any Billboard chart. The set also lands at No. 6 on Top Album Sales , No. 1 on Top Rock Albums , Alternative Albums and Catalog Albums and No. 2 on Digital Albums . \nThe greatest share of the sales of I Make the Static (which sold for $4.95 in the iTunes Store) were generated Feb. 13, the day after the Grammy Awards, as Nielsen reports that about 13,000 copies were sold that day. About 2,000 were sold on the day of the Grammys. \nAs previously noted , based on reviews in the iTunes Store, it appears the album generated sales largely from Trump supporters previously unaware of the singer. Reviews include sentiments like “thank you for supporting TRUMP!! Will buy now! Thanks!,” “I’m buying the album just because of the dress. Way to go girl!” and “I don’t know this artist, but it doesn’t matter. I am supporting her bravery on Grammy night for standing for what she believes, whether others agree or not.” \nBased on early forecasts from industry sources, Villa’s album will likely drop from No. 12 to below No. 100 on the Billboard 200 in its second chart week, with perhaps 3,000 copies sold in the week ending Feb. 23.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:47:39.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
