Similar to the Cinnamon Challenge , the game has spawned dozens of videos documenting the challenge on YouTube . Origin \nThough online discussions about placing an ice cube over salt on bare skin date back to as early as 2005 [5] , the first video demonstration was uploaded to Break [6] on July 8th, 2006 (shown below). As of March 2013, this clip has been viewed nearly 600,000 times and has been shared more than 166,000 times. Spread \nFour days later on July 12th, 2006, YouTuber OxZmoran uploaded the earliest known instance of salt and ice challenge video (shown below). Later the same month, a Snopes forum member [7] inquired about the trick, noting that people were discussing it as a method of self-harm. By October 2006, a similar “Salt and Ice” video was posted to eBaum’s World [8] for the first time, gaining nearly 500,000 views as of March 2013. \nOn June 9th, 2007, a definition of the game was submitted to Urban Dictionary. [9] However, the challenge didn’t draw much attention until April 2012, when teenagers who participated in the dare game reportedly suffered burns in Philadelphia [10] and Salt Lake City.

[12] The story was featured on The Huffington Post [13] , the Daily Mail [14] , CBS News [15] and NBC Los Angeles. Resurgence in 2017 \nWhile the popularity of the challenge gradually waned across the United States, it continued to spread on the social media in European countries, with seasonally recurring spikes of interest during the months of December to March, over the course of the following years, including the United Kingdom, Spain, The Netherlands and Italy, among others. In some European countries, like Poland, Germany and France, the fad didn’t take off until its massive resurgence in popularity during December 2016, when the salt and ice challenge resurfaced in the headlines after more teenagers in the United States and United Kingdom reportedly suffered severe burn injuries as a result of playing the game, beginning with a schoolboy in Swansea, Wales in late December.
