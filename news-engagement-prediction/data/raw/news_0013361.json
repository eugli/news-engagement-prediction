The manuals appear to have been taken down at this point as a search for them on the LG support page comes back with no results, but there are a few screenshots below that were captured which point out a few details about each device and what users will be able to do with them. \nThe manuals reportedly didn’t offer up much in the way of hardware specifications details, so none of the previously rumored specs have been confirmed and likely won’t be until Google and LG unveil the watches which is expected to happen this week. Details that can be found in the manual though include things like what the charging dock looks like, as both watches will charge wirelessly. The interesting thing is that both watches seem to have a different type of wireless charging dock. According to the diagram in the manual for the LG Watch Sport, the charging dock looks a lot like, or rather exactly like the charging dock for the Moto 360 line of smartwatches, while the dock for the LG Watch Style seems to be more of a round shaped wireless charging pad. \nThe manuals also show that the LG Watch Style will have easily swappable watch straps and will make use of the release latch that can be found on the MODE watch bands, a detail which can be seen in the leaked image of the LG watch Style that popped up earlier this month. Other details are highlighted in the manual too like how to remove the back watch case plating to swap out the SIM card on the LG Watch Sport , which is completed with the help of a tool that will come packaged in the box. You can also see a diagram showing how to use the LG Watch Sport to make mobile payments through the use of the integrated NFC, and it showcases that users will tap the watch display to a contact point for the transmission to go through and initiate the payment.
