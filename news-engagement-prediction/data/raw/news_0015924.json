Which presumably is in reference to the likelihood that the LG G6 will come with a bezel-less display or at least, as close to being bezel-less as possible. While LG has yet to confirm much of the details on the G6, it is largely expected that the smartphone will come with a 5.7-inch display, a ‘QHD+’ resolution and an 18:9 aspect ratio. It seems those specs are what will be behind the ‘Full Vision’ marketing approach of the display. \nOther than that marketing aspect, the current reports do not provide any newer information on what should be expected from the LG G6, display or otherwise. Although a new report which came through earlier today suggested that the LG G6 will actually become available on March 9 in South Korea. This will then be followed by its US availability going live on April 7 , just before Samsung makes its newest smartphone available, the Galaxy S8. Likewise, a device was spotted being benchmarked on Geekbench over the last couple of days with the model number LG-H871. There is no confirmation that this is the LG G6, although that is the assumption being made by some. The benchmark seemingly confirms that if this is the LG G6, it will come sporting 4GB RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor. Although, a number of recent reports have been looking to confirm that the LG G6 will actually come powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821. In either case, the benchmark also looked to confirm that the LG G6 will come running on Android 7.0 (Nougat) out of the box. \nIrrespective of the general specs, this latest piece of information coupled with the reports that have come through before now do highly suggest that LG will be pushing the display as one of the main selling points for the LG G6. Not only its unique aspect ratio and resolution, but also its general size relationship to the phone overall. In the very shortest of terms, it does seem likely that the LG will be a smartphone that is ‘all screen’. Which is interesting as other recent reports suggest Samsung will be pushing the Galaxy S8 in a very similar way.
