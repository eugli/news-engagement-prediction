Our 360 video follows them at New York Fashion Week. • New to watch and read. We review “ The Great Wall ,” starring Matt Damon, and “ A Cure for Wellness ,” which our critic calls “a lustrous box of genre candy.” If you’re looking for some heavier fare, consider streaming these documentaries , which won Oscars in recent years. In books, “ Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow ” focuses on the future of the human species. “In seeking bliss and immortality,” the author writes, “humans are in fact trying to upgrade themselves into gods.” Last, a novelist examines what it means to be polite in society today. • Best of late-night TV.
