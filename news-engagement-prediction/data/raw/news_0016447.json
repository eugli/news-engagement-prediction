While the star favours mid-century modern furniture and a white colour palette, she adds vibrant pops of colour with accessories such as a red striped rug in the hallway. Meghan uses her cookbooks as a decor feature, including The Kinfolk Table which explores the relationships that surround the food we eat, by perching jugs of flowers on top of them Meghan favours a white colour palette but adds pops of colour with accessories such as a red striped rug in the hallway Above the bed in the guest room hangs a figure study watercolour by New York based artist and illustrator Inslee Fariss, estimated to have cost $650 (£520) The actress snuggles up with her dogs and a glass of wine on the white couch at her Toronto home,to which she's added understated striped cushions Guy plays in the snow in Meghan's garden which she's kitted out with a huge BBQ and a seating area with wooden decking She's also a fan of fresh flowers, especially pink peonies which she's declared are her favourite. But rather than being a gift from Harry, she reveals that she regularly treats herself to her favourite bouquets. 'I bought these peonies for myself yesterday because they make me so endlessly happy. Do something sweet for yourself today too,' she advised her followers. She's also a fan of a scented candle, including Diptyque's Figuier with fresh wood, green notes and crushed fig leaves and the Le Labo Santal 26 Classic Candle, £51, with 'gentle, smokey and leathery tones'. Meghan's bedside table features a Le Labo Santal 26 Classic Candle, £51, Vogue creative director Grace Coddington's memoir, and tasseled Buddhist prayer beads Meghan's dog Bogart relaxes on a woven wooden chair by the dining table.

Meghan scents her home with diffusers and candles, including Diptyque's Figuier (right) with fresh wood, green notes and crushed fig leaves Meghan's artfully arranged shoe closet, which she reordered to perfection during a sick day Adding a creative touch, Meghan uses a weathered vintage chest as a unique coffee table and decorates it with fresh flowers and one of her favourite cookery books Like any self-respecting fashionista, Meghan has an extensive collection of shoes and recently rearranged her closet to perfection while having a sick day at home. Meghan has artfully arranged her books around the house, turning them into design features by perching them underneath jugs of flowers. She's a fan of coffee table fashion books, such as former Vogue Paris editor Carine Roitfeld's style bible and Linda McCartney's photographic memoir. Her garden features a black metal love seat with black and white striped cushions and it's not just for human visitors to enjoy Meghan in her immaculate back yard during a sunny Toronto afternoon after purchasing herself yet another bouquet of flowers The star has added depth to the room with an aged vintage mirror, which she's placed behind her dining table A trio of prints on the wall add colour to Meghan's ultra neutral living space, which is softly lit with pendant lights hanging over the dining table The Kinfolk Table by magazine editor Nathan Williams also features in several of her snaps, a tome that's part cookbook, part narrative tale and part photography from around the world. Her garden isn't neglected either, and Meghan grows her own hydrangeas which she snips and puts in jam jars to decorate the house. She's also kitted out the space with a seating area with wooden decking, a large BBQ and a black metal love seat with monochrome striped cushions.
