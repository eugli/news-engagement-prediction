It managed to cross the Waikato River and threaten Taupo itself. It eventually burned through tens of thousands of hectares and forced a law change which allowed adequate provision for rural fire control \nFebruary 1983 - A farm burnoff at Ohinewairua Station, near Waiouru, went out of control and burned through about 15,000ha of tussock and beech forest. \nDecember 2000 - The Boxing Day Wither Hills fire, near Blenheim, tore through more than 6000ha, damaging 29 properties. It took nearly three months to extinguish \nNovember 2011 - A helicopter pilot and his passenger were killed when trying to rescue people trapped by a fire at Karikari Beach in Northland. The deliberately lit fire burned through 130ha of scrub \nFebruary 2017 - A fire in Christchurch's Port Hills burns through more than 2000ha, destroying at least 11 houses, and a helicopter pilot helping fight the blaze is killed in a crash. \n12.19pm: The latest update from Christchurch City Council and Civil Defence: \nMore than 130 firefighters are currently on the ground fighting the Port Hills fire. \nThe main activity is in the northern area of the Port Hills, including Hoon Hay Valley Road, Dyers Pass Road and Worsley Road. \nThe Fire Service has 40 crews with 45 pumps and tankers and there are 26 rural fire crews with more than 200 personnel. Fourteen helicopters are in the air, along with three fixed wing aircraft. \nThe situation is constantly changing regarding property damage, but the latest report is that 11 houses and two sheds have been lost. Four of the houses are in Worsleys Road, four in Hoon Hay Valley Road, one house and one shed on Burkes Bush Road, and two houses and one shed on Early Valley Road.

It is too soon to be able to answer this with any certainty. People are encouraged to monitor Civil Defence and Council web and social media channels for the latest updates. As soon as any information is available about when people can return Civil Defence will ensure that it is widely publicised. \nThe fire, which started in Marleys Hills on Monday night has now spread over 1800 hectares on the Port Hills. \nEmergency services are preparing to continue their operations for at least over the weekend and say the immediate emphasis is on directing the huge fire away from people and property. \nHelicopters have been brought in from throughout the South Island and out of town fire service staff from both Nelson and Timaru and are boosting local resources. \nThere are concerns about the short-term weather forecast with today’s north-east wind today expected to further drive the fronts. It is hoped a south-west change predicted for tomorrow will lower temperatures and humidity, slowing the fire’s progress. The Red Cross has mobilised to help.

Fire Region Manager Steve Turek says it is important that there is no type of fire lit so fire resources can remain concentrated on the major fire. \nChristchurch Police have dedicated 50 staff working around the clock on the operation. Police, assisted by New Zealand Defence Force staff, have managed the evacuation of residents in at-risk areas. 400 homes have been evacuated by police with hundreds of other residents choosing to self-evacuate. \nSuperintendent John Price of Christchurch Police says patrols are also working around the clock in both areas at risk and those evacuation. “We are providing reassurance to residents about evacuation, but also to others that we are keeping a watchful eye on their property,” he said. \nNo evacuations are underway at this time, but police warn the situation is extremely volatile and should the fire change direction, people may have to leave at short notice. \nPolice are also checking on the safety of contractors working on the fire, logging everyone who goes into and out of the cordon. \nThe main message remains - the police are stressing that it is imperative that members of the public keep away from the hills. People “rubber-necking” are disrupting the emergency response and making it harder for police and fire services to do their jobs. \nThe New Zealand Defence Force had 36 staff working alongside emergency services last night and another 25 have joined the operation this morning. \nWelfare and health agencies are on standby to step in at a moment’s notice.

Kordia says spare transmission equipment is being taken to Christchurch and radio stations say people should switch to the AM frequency if they go off air. \nThe blaze, which started as two separate fires on Monday and which sparked a local Civil Defence state of emergency, was fanned by wind change, merged into one and covered more than 1850ha on Wednesday night, Civil Defence says. \nReports suggest it has now spread to the harbour side of Sugarloaf. \nSixteen helicopters with monsson buckets took to the air at first light on Thursday but it could be another grim day. \nRain isn't expected until Friday afternoon. \n\"It's not a really good forecast for firefighting... we are expecting winds to develop this afternoon,\" Civil Defence controller Dave Adamson told RNZ. \nAn easterly wind is expected to turn into a northerly over the morning, with wind speeds picking up to 30km/h in the afternoon. \n\"At this point in time the fire's not threatening any other properties... but we'll just have to see how the day and the fire develops,\" Mr Adamson said. \nOn Thursday morning, Christchurch Civil Defence said a temperature drop and rise in humidity had helped drop the fire activity. \n\"There are still some very active fire fronts up on the Port Hills, but not as many as there were prior to midnight,\" the council said. \n8.49am: UPDATE: Governors Bay School will be open today.
