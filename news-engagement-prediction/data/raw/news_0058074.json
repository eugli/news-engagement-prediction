With a chance on Wednesday night to wash away memories of a Jan. 4 road loss to the Bulldogs, the Wildcats crumbled down the stretch and fell 74-66 at the Pavilion in front of their home crowd. NCAA March Madness on Twitter provided a stat that exemplified just how impressive Butler's win on the Main Line was: NCAA March Madness @marchmadness DOWN GOES NOVA! No. 22 Butler completes sweep of No. 2 Wildcats, 74-66. First time Villanova seniors have lost at the Pavilion (45-1). https://t.co/6umorQfw4v After the win, ESPN.com's Jeff Goodman noted that Butler's resume ranks among the nation's most impressive: Jeff Goodman @GoodmanESPN 2/23/2017, 4:28:32 AM Although the Wildcats had their moments, 15 turnovers, a lackluster 25.0 percent shooting from three and 62.5 percent shooting from the free-throw line prevented them from pulling away after they established a seven-point edge with 12 minutes remaining. From that point forward, the Bulldogs imposed their will and put the finishing touches on a season sweep of the Wildcats as they scorched Villanova's stingy defense to the tune of 46 second-half points. Kelan Martin and Kamar Baldwin were the driving forces behind the comeback triumph, and they finished the night with 22 and 15 points, respectively. However, the Bulldogs weren't always in control. Despite a sluggish start, the Wildcats clawed back throughout the opening frame thanks to Jalen Brunson's (24 points) stellar scoring touch, which was on display early and often, as FS1 documented on Twitter: FS1 @FS1 The handles. The move. The finish. WHAT A PLAY! Jalen Brunson making it happen for No.2 @NovaMBB. #BIGEAST https://t.co/JiDiApOKfE Brunson entered halftime with 14 points —nearly 50 percent of Villanova's total —and the Wildcats trotted into the locker room with a one-point lead after the sophomore converted a sweet blow-by with the clock winding down, via FS1 on Twitter: FS1 @FS1 The perfect ending to the half. Too easy. Jalen Brunson beats the buzzer for No.2 @NovaMBB. #BIGEAST https://t.co/S6CbO3tIkx 2/23/2017, 3:05:56 AM Once the second half got underway, Villanova appeared to find a more stable stride. Not only did the offense establish improved rhythm, but its defense caused Butler's attack to stall in the half court on several occasions. College hoops analyst Doug Gottlieb praised the Wildcats defense for being equal parts tenacious and disciplined: Doug Gottlieb @GottliebShow #Nova has become the most physical team in the Big East the past two years and they get called for the fewest fouls 2/23/2017, 3:34:46 AM Villanova's stifling defense was on display in the early stages of the second half, when it suffocated the Bulldogs and forced a turnover that allowed Mikal Bridges to hit Josh Hart (18 points) in stride for a dunk, as FS1 showed on Twitter: FS1 @FS1 Defense leads to offense leads to a Josh Hart SLAM! What a play by No.2 @NovaMBB. #BIGEAST https://t.co/KqLkBruwii 2/23/2017, 3:35:02 AM But to the Bulldogs' credit, they were able to hang tough in one of the Big East's most hostile environments and counterpunch brilliantly. A barrage of threes allowed Butler to tie things at 49 with under eight minutes remaining, and the Bulldogs took the lead shortly thereafter thanks to a fearless approach from beyond the arc. Butler's official Twitter account relayed video of the team's scorching second-half stylings from deep in the midst of a tide-turning 18-0 run: Butler Basketball @ButlerMBB 2/23/2017, 3:54:30 AM Butler's lead continued to balloon down the stretch, and the Wildcats simply weren't sharp enough on either end to swing momentum back in their favor one last time. Villanova would have had a chance to rattle off an eighth straight win with a more complete effort on Wednesday, but it will now be forced to regroup in advance of the Big East tournament. Next up for the Wildcats is a showdown with the Creighton Bluejays on Saturday at the Pavilion. The Bulldogs, meanwhile, will prep for a clash with the Xavier Musketeers on Sunday before they wrap their regular-season slate up with a game against Seton Hall on March 4.
