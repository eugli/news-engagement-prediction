When he was five, he was scared to go on the roundabout in Legoland Amanda Gallagher will never forget the first time she took her young son, Harry, to Legoland. Nothing could induce him to go on a roundabout, let alone one of the theme park’s more thrilling rides. He was too frightened, she says, remembering him clinging to her legs. Amanda worried that five-year-old Harry would turn out to be one of those boys too timid to try anything new. Fast forward 14 years and it’s a terrifyingly different story. Every time Harry, 19, leaves the house, it’s Amanda who is scared, wondering if she will ever see him alive again. She certainly never imagined the little boy who once hid behind her skirts and wore cute Spider-Man pyjamas would turn into the hoodie-wearing daredevil who last week risked life and limb to climb 774ft to the top of One Canada Square in Canary Wharf, then on Monday posted the stomach-churning pictures on social media. The first Amanda knew of it was when Harry emerged from his bedroom in their cosy East London maisonette the next day and casually asked his mother: ‘Have you seen the video? No? Well, please don’t because you won’t like it.’ Never a truer word. For what mother — especially one who suffers from vertigo — would enjoy seeing her beloved son dangling from the pyramid at the top of a 50-storey skyscraper with no safety harness, instead of earning a living in one of its offices? Mother Amanda certainly never imagined the little boy who once hid behind her skirts and wore cute Spider-Man pyjamas would turn into the hoodie-wearing daredevil who risks life and limb Now Harry’s video has gone viral on the internet — causing an almighty brouhaha over lax security at a time of heightened terrorist threat, not to mention a police investigation — Amanda has finally forced herself to sit down and watch it. Part of her marvels at her son’s utter fearlessness, strength and dexterity. She also declares herself incredibly ‘proud’ of his talents as an aerial photographer. But she visibly trembles at the thought that one false step could have ended in the most horrible of deaths for Harry. And, no, she can’t do anything to stop him. Believe her, she’s tried. ‘I love my son. I don’t want him to die. I’m not an irresponsible mother,’ says Amanda, 51, a mosaic artist. ‘I have wept, pleaded, begged, reasoned, even threatened to lock him in his room to try to stop him doing this. ‘I say to him: “Son, get an office job. Take up knitting. Do anything but this.” ‘We’ve all tried — his grandparents, his father and older brother — but he just won’t listen. It’s his passion. ‘He knows I worry about him, but it makes no difference.’ Part of Amanda marvels at her son’s utter fearlessness, strength and dexterity. She also declares herself incredibly ‘proud’ of his talents as an aerial photographer Harry can’t see what all the fuss is about. ‘If I climbed a mountain I’d be admired, but if I climb a building I’m called an idiot,’ he says. His mum can’t share his confidence. ‘The only way I can cope is to distance myself,’ says Amanda. ‘When he says: “I’m just popping up to town,” I don’t ask where he’s going. I am walking a tightrope between supporting his every step through life as a mother and wishing he would grow out of this. ‘It only seems like yesterday he was too scared on go on a roundabout, but today he’d be climbing to the top of the rides.’ Harry can’t see what all the fuss is about. ‘If I climbed a mountain I’d be admired, but if I climb a building I’m called an idiot,’ he says Amanda can’t understand how she could have produced two such different boys. For while her elder son Nathan, 23, a Nottingham University philosophy graduate, works in the City in marketing, Harry regularly drives her to despair. Yet both were raised the same. Her eight-year marriage to their father, Bill, ended when Harry was four, but the boys maintained a close relationship with him, and he and Amanda are still friends. ‘I don’t know when or why that switch flicked inside Harry and he turned from being fearful to totally fearless,’ says Amanda. ‘So many times I’ve asked myself: “What did I do wrong?” ’ While Amanda's elder son Nathan, 23, a Nottingham University philosophy graduate, works in the City in marketing, Harry regularly drives her to despair Part of the appeal for Harry, she thinks, is adrenaline; part the thrill of feeling alive while staring death in the face. But the most worrying part for Amanda is the kudos of having a video go viral. Harry has 74,000 followers on Instagram and half a million on YouTube. Such global adulation could become addictive. Then, of course, there’s his natural athleticism. A natural gymnast, he progressed, aged seven, to the elite squad at the local gymnastics club. Harry has 74,000 followers on Instagram and half a million on YouTube. Such global adulation could become addictive ‘Harry had talent. He could have gone on to compete in the Olympics,’ says Amanda. ‘But he hated the rules. Even as a child he wanted the freedom to do it his way.’ Instead, he and his brother channelled their youthful energies into the fringe activity known as ‘free-running’ or ‘parkour’. Enthusiasts treat the city landscape as a giant obstacle course to be scaled and somersaulted. Every weekend, dad Bill would take Nathan and Harry to the South Bank — where free-running groups meet — to practise. It seemed like a healthy hobby, no more dangerous than gymnastics or any other sport which carries a degree of risk. A natural gymnast, he progressed, aged seven, to the elite squad at the local gymnastics club But while Nathan eventually gave it up to concentrate on his studies, Harry became obsessed. Dropping out of school after his GCSEs to concentrate on it, he would head off with his friends to London to train, disappearing for hours at a time. ‘When he was 11 or 12, his dad was always there to keep an eye on him and keep him safe, but when they get older and head out on their own, you don’t know what they’re getting up to,’ says Amanda. ‘You just don’t think your child is going to start scaling tall buildings and they are not going to tell you, in case you try to stop them — which I did when I found out what he was doing.’ For Harry’s Canary Wharf stunt was not the first time he has risked his life to take one of his ‘Nightscape’ photographs. Aged just 17 he scaled London skyscrapers the ‘Cheesegrater’ (real name the Leadenhall Building), the ‘Walkie Talkie’ (20 Fenchurch Street) and the unfinished London Pinnacle. He has climbed a 500ft-high crane on the Isle of Dogs and teetered on the edge of a tower of Guy’s Hospital near the Shard. Last October he and two friends breached West Ham’s stadium at the Olympic Park in East London and Harry posed with his feet dangling from the roof — the video of which got four million hits. Although Harry begins his videos with a ‘don’t try this at home’ message, the West Ham caper sparked 13 copycat attempts. Aged just 17 he scaled London skyscrapers the ‘Cheesegrater’ (real name the Leadenhall Building), the ‘Walkie Talkie’ (20 Fenchurch Street) and the unfinished London Pinnacle Amanda is appalled at the thought of other, less confident or gymnastically trained, youngsters trying to emulate her son. Despite being arrested twice, Harry has never been prosecuted because trespass is not a crime unless it takes place on protected sites, such as MoD land or railway lines, or results in criminal damage or theft. But all this, Amanda has reluctantly come to learn, is one of the risk-taking thrills of being a free-running ‘Urban Explorer’ for whom a day at the office means clinging by one hand to the top of it. And one-upmanship drives them to take ever more extreme risks. Only last week Russian model Victoria Odintcova, 23, risked her life to get the perfect shot, hanging by one hand from the 1,000ft-high Cayan Tower in Dubai. But, there are those who tragically didn’t live to post their images online. In December 2015 American college student Connor Cummings, 20, fell to his death taking photographs from the roof of the Four Seasons hotel in New York. Despite being arrested twice, Harry has never been prosecuted because trespass is not a crime unless it takes place on protected sites, such as MoD land or railway lines, or results in criminal damage or theft (file photo) ‘Harry is fearless, but he’s not an idiot. It takes a great deal of fitness and training to do what he does,’ says Amanda. ‘He is aware of the risks and is very careful. ‘He can’t explain to me why he does it, though. I don’t understand it. I am not entirely sure he does either.’ But Amanda has her own ideas, which is why she now refuses to condemn her son or betray any anger at the emotional wringer he is currently putting her through. She worries that Harry’s determination to confront his own mortality in the most terrifying of challenges is a reaction to her own brushes with death. The daughter of a floor manager at the Ritz hotel casino, Amanda was 14 when she almost died after being electrocuted by a broken bedside lamp in an accident at home. She spent months in hospital undergoing skin grafts. Amanda worries that Harry’s determination to confront his own mortality in the most terrifying of challenges is a reaction to her own brushes with death She met Bill, a builder, when they were both travelling in Israel. They married and settled in Essex, but when Harry was seven months old, Amanda was diagnosed with a pituitary tumour. She underwent surgery and recovered, only to be diagnosed ten years later with stage 4 non-Hodgkin follicular Lymphoma, for which she underwent six months of chemotherapy. She is now in remission. Combined with the breakdown of her marriage to Bill, Amanda wonders if this later episode of ill-health shaped Harry’s attitude. ‘He has never talked about it, but I think with Harry there is a sense of living life for the moment, one day at a time, because you never know when it might end,’ explains Amanda. ‘If I thought he was just doing this for thrills, I’d be angry. But there is a psychological and emotional element, and I feel very responsible for that.’ Harry's mother almost died after being electrocuted by a broken bedside lamp in an accident at home. She spent months in hospital undergoing skin grafts She also believes that Harry’s idea of making money from his exploits — he sells £15 posters of his Nightscape photographs along with T-shirts and hoodies — is driven more by an urge to provide for her than wanting to be a YouTube star. For the past three years, ill-health has plagued Amanda and chronic migraines have left her unable to work. Harry developed his entrepreneurial streak at a time when Amanda could no longer afford to buy a jar of coffee. But she says: ‘Even if he made a million, would that be worth losing his life for? No.’ Amanda said: ‘Harry is a very bright, talented, focused young man and I’m very proud of that but it’s a double-edged sword' While Amanda can appreciate the skill of her son’s photography and prays it will ultimately lead to a more conventional career, she much prefers the sweet childhood photographs on the wall of their East London home. ‘Harry is a very bright, talented, focused young man and I’m very proud of that but it’s a double-edged sword. ‘I just hope that he takes all those skills he has developed and one day channels them into something else. ‘Every time Harry leaves the house, I pray he will come back in one piece.’ The alternative just doesn’t bear thinking about.
