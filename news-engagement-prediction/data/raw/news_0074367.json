Harvey Price accepted a special award from his mum (Photo: ITV/Twitter) \nBut they suffered their own mistake - oh, the perils of live TV.

Harvey's name appeared on the screen before Katie announced him as the winner (Photo: ITV) \nA short video was played of Harvey accepting his award and making a speech. \nHe said: \"Hey, thank you for Loose Women for award. Thank you mummy for everything, love you so much.\" \nHe then blew a kiss to the camera. \nViewers couldn't handle how cute he was.

His videos always make me smile. How people can be mean about him is disgusting x,\" said another. \nThe Loose Women went on to attempt their own spoof of the moment Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced the wrong winner. \nStacey's boyfriend Joe Swash began accepting a Loscar from her, before he was cut off mid-sentence and told there had been a mistake. \nIt was actually the former X Factor star's sons, Zachary and Leighton, who had won the prize.
