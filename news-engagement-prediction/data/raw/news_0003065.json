(Jacy Schindel/CBC)\nHope suspects the region's record-breaking cold snap is the cause of the change in routine.\n\"Back in November when the river was really high, the salmon got blown out of the rivers so there wasn't as much food as there is in normal years,\" he explained.\n\"So they were forced to find a secondary food source to sustain them until they divert to their breeding grounds.\"\nThe eagles aren't just attracted to the scraps at the organics composting facility, the hundreds of seagulls in the area are another source of food. (Jacy Schindel/CBC)\nIn addition to the scraps found at the composting facility, Hope says the raptors are also preying on the flocks of seagulls and ducks who have also been attracted to the area.\nHe says if the composting facility wasn't there, the birds could have been \"in a bit of trouble\" because of the stress of finding food.\nAvid bird watchers have already been heading to publicly accessible viewing areas around the farm along the 4300 block of 72 Street.\nHope asks members of the public to respect private property and stay off the roads when taking photos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T01:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:30:42.144+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
