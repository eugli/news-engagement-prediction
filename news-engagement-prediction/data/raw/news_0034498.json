'Is Genesis History?' In Cinemas Nationwide for One Night Feb. 23 \nDr. Del Tackett is part of an upcoming film titled \"Is Genesis History?\" and he's hoping the documentary will give Christians the confidence they need to stand strong on the Word of God, particularly the creation account, without compromise. \n\"I'm hoping that people will look at the film and they would realize that they don't have to accede to the accusation that if you hold to a position of [young earth], of a literal historical position in Genesis, then [you are] unscientific or stupid,\" Tackett told The Christian Post during the premiere screening at The Creation Museum earlier this month. \n\"My hope is that those people that want to hold to biblical truth would walk away with the confidence that there is credible evidence and there are credible scientists, that they could be sure that what God has given us is true and can hold onto that.\" \nThe documentary follows Tackett as he embarks on an eye-opening educational journey through evidence that supports historic claims from the book of Genesis, featuring commentary from renowned scientists and Bible scholars. \nThe film explores the questions and findings of the universe being created in six literal days, as well as whether or not humans evolved, the validity of a global flood, what happened to the dinosaurs and more. \n\"Here's my position, and I think it's one of the things that I've learned throughout the film: We are in an amazing time when the research is allowing us to see so much data that reinforces a Creator, that reinforces what He told us in the beginning,\" Tackett said to CP. \"And I think it's going to be increasingly difficult for the current paradigm to last much longer.\" \nParadigms that continually have to make adjustments to be considered truth or that constantly need to revisited are usually paradigms that do not hold up, he noted. \n\"Right now the Big Bang Theory is headed in that direction,\" the former president of the Focus on the Family Institute argued. \"My personal belief is that Einstein's theory is also problematic, and Darwin's theory is most problematic. \n\"I would tell Christians, 'If you are going to put your trust in those and you're going to say that God's Word is now just an analogy, or it's just some kind of simile, you're twisting the Word of God because of a paradigm that is already really shaky.' I would say, 'You have that backwards. We start with the Word of God. We start with the record that God has given to us and stand on that, then begin to view the world around us. That's when things will make sense.'\" \nThe same is true when people try to make sense of evil, he noted. \"If you come from a natural position, you won't understand it. But if you come from it as it is described in the word of God, then it does make sense.\" \nBut he finds that many Christians today are trying to acclimate their beliefs to what the world is saying about the creation of the earth. \n\"We live in a time where the current scientific paradigm is infiltrating a lot of the seminaries and a lot of the hierarchy in evangelical Christianity because people have been led to believe that science has settled this issue of deep time,\" Tackett lamented. \nIf Christians are now feeling that they have to somehow rectify their faith for a scientific perspective, Tackett said then they are ripping out the foundation of everything that God has given to His creation. \nClaiming that Genesis is what lays the foundation of what's to come from the coming Messiah, Tackett maintained that God's judgment for sin is what sent a great flood over the earth, foreshadowing Jesus — the ark in which Christians can now find safety in. \n\"It lays the foundation for what we see. As God said, there would be a war between the seed of the woman and the seed of Satan. Throughout the Old Testament that's the battle we see — the battle trying to destroy that seed line that would bring forth the Messiah,\" he expounded, observing that if that foundational belief system is removed, then all of the above is lost. \nFree sign up cp newsletter!
