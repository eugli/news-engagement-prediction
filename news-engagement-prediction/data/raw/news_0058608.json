The draft is currently 553 pages thick. ADVERTISEMENT \nRevilla’s camp, joined only last month by star defense lawyer Estelito Mendoza, stressed in their 36-page comment that the pre-trial is meant to ensure the case’s “prompt disposition through a simplification of issues.” \nHis camp asked the court if the prosecution should still prove how the pork-funded projects failed to materialize when Revilla was accused of acquiring ill-gotten wealth already before the implementation stage. \n“Plaintiff’s evidence, particularly those that tend to prove ‘ghost or fictitious projects’ referred to in the Amended Information should be excluded from these proceedings, for being irrelevant and immaterial to the charge of plunder against accused Revilla,” the comment stated. \nEven during the originally scheduled start of trial on Jan. 12 , Revilla and his wife, Bacoor City Mayor Lani Mercado, had bemoaned that the huge number of witnesses and documents would prolong his trial and detention. \nDuring the hearing, Office of the Special Prosecutor Director Joefferson Toribio said the prosecution would present 119 witnesses. \nAccording to the draft pretrial order, witnesses include JLN Corp. whistleblowers Benhur Luy, Marina Sula and Merlina Suñas; Commission on Audit Assistant Commissioner Susan Garcia; National Bureau of Investigation supervising agent Rodante Berou; and various government officials, records custodians and bank managers. \nThis is on top of the hundreds of documentary exhibits, a listing of which at a glance already takes up 400 pages of the draft pretrial order. The Sandiganbayan’s draft pretrial order to govern the presentation of evidence in former Senator Bong Revilla’s plunder trial already runs 553 pages long.
