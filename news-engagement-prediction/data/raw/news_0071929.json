I really hope it sends a message that no matter what your race, size or disability — whatever makes you different — you are beautiful.” \nIt sure is a big thing for an industry that's known for its perfection, to not just accommodate a participant like Clarke but also reward her for her courage and strength. \nClarke did not want to reveal the reasons that brought about the change in her life but wants \"the catwalk to be a fair and inclusive place for everyone (sic)\". She strongly believes that being in a wheelchair does not limit or define her.
