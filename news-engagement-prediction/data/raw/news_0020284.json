Alerted by screams from the victim, the driver stopped the bus and fled with the passengers as he continued his attack.\nIn 2009, Mr Baker was found not criminally responsible for the killing. He then spent seven years in treatment in a secure wing of a psychiatric hospital.\nIn an interview with a schizophrenia society in 2012, he said he heard what he believed was \"the voice of God\".\n\"The voice told me that I was the third story of the Bible, that I was like the second coming of Jesus [and that] I was to save people from a space alien attack.\"\nHe also said he was \"really sorry\" for what he had done.\nMr Baker was allowed last year to live on his own apartment in Winnipeg, Manitoba, but was still subject to monitoring to ensure he took his medication.\nBut his doctors told Manitoba's Criminal Code Review Board that he understood that he needed to take the medication and that he would continue with his treatment if released.\n\"The review board is of the opinion that the weight of evidence does not substantiate that Mr Baker poses a significant threat to the safety of the public,\" the review board said in a written decision.", "external_links": ["http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3458881/Manitoba-Criminal-Code-Review-Board-decision.pdf", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/F61F/production/_94270036_87abaed3-4214-4c4c-ab84-cc2fe1feeaa6.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-18170463", "https://www.facebook.com/carol.dedelley/posts/10154989609026252?pnref=story", "http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/mobile/world/americas/7925085.stm"], "published": "2017-02-11T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T18:45:17.226+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
