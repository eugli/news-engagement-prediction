This change did not have an effect on the UAE dirham which has it sitting at 18.09 in the morning. Besides, the dollar's weakness against some currencies overseas supported the rupee but a lower opening of the domestic equity market capped the gain, forex dealers said. On Thursday, the rupee had gained 14 paise to close at 66.82 a dollar on fresh selling of the American currency by banks and exporters on the back of weakness of greenback in the overseas market. Forex market was closed on Friday on account of Shivratri. Meanwhile, the benchmark BSE Sensex down 80.09 points, or 0.27 per cent, to 28,812.88 in morning trade.
