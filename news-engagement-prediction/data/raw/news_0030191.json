High water levels at Lake Oroville this weekend prompted authorities to use the dam's emergency spillway for the first time in its nearly 50-year history. The main spillway had suffered unexpected erosion earlier this week after heavy rains caused a 30-foot-deep hole in the structure.\nSEE ALSO: From drought to flood, nation's biggest dam topped for first time in 50 years \nIn aerial footage, water is seen roaring down the dam's damaged spillway, looking like the world's most terrifying waterslide. The emergency spillway appears more like a muddy mess of small creeks that spill menacingly from the reservoir.\nThe situation at Oroville Dam comes as much of California is suffering from climate whiplash.\nAfter enduring a record six-year drought, parts of the Golden State are seeing near-record levels of rain and snowfall as a slew of atmospheric \"rivers\" dump precipitation across the region.\nIn California's Northern Sierra region, total precipitation is already at 68 inches for the season — far above the 2015-2016 total of 57.9 inches, and only 20.5 inches shy of the record 1982-1983 season, according to the National Weather Service.\nWith more rain expected later this week, California authorities are scrambling to fix the Oroville Dam's spillways and reduce the reservoir's water levels to avoid another debacle at the dam.\nHere's the latest @NWSWPC precip forecast for #NorCal thru the upcoming weekend.

Its reservoir is the nation's second-biggest man-made lake.\nCalifornia's Department of Water Resources on Sunday evening ordered the evacuation of around 200,000 people from towns lying below Lake Oroville. \nOfficials warned the main and emergency spillways could both fail, sending a dangerous 30-foot wall of water into communities below. California Gov. Jerry Brown issued an emergency order on Sunday to help with response efforts.\nBy Monday morning, however, the immediate threat seemed to have passed. \nWater levels at Lake Oroville had dropped to around 897 feet, below the 901-foot threshold for using the lake's spillways.\nFlows over the emergency spillway had stopped, while about 100,000 cubic feet-per-second of water continued down the main spillway, the Department of Water Resources said.\nCredit for first video: Instagram/radbones4l via Storyful \nBONUS: Veteran caught in extreme flooding saved thanks to drone", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T02:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:46:49.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
