We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.' The sensors in the phone are said to detect the location and depth of objects around it. And although the iPhone 7 Plus is already designed with ‘an immature form of depth detecting’, reports 9to5Mac, Kuo said the 3D sensing in the iPhone is much more advanced when it comes to using a dedicated infrared transmitter and receiver. It could place the user’s face on a computer animated character – the front facing camera and 3D sensor would let iOS owners use their selfies for augmented reality. And it could also be used in facial recognition or as an iris scanner for unlocking the device He predicts the infrared transmitter will use vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser technology from Lumentum, which has been a rumor in the past. Sony is said to be the mastermind behind the front camera and Foxconn/Sharp will develop the IR receiver. The complete 3D system would omit invisible IR light signals from the phone and then wait for them to hit objects and return using the 1.4 megapixel IR receiver. And Kuo also predicts that Apple will add the same technology to the rear-facing camera in the future. COULD THE IPHONE 8 HAVE A LARGER BATTERY? Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities has revealed that Apple plans to put a larger battery in the 4.7-inch iPhone 8. Kuo explained that it will be designed with a 2,700 mAh battery - putting its battery capacity on par with the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple plans to put a larger battery in the 4.7-inch iPhone 8, it has been claimed Will use a 'substrate-like PCB mainboard', which will allow the firm to implement an OLED display in the flagship handset. The new components are believed to be much more expensive in anything used in an iPhone before, which could increase manufacturing costs by 80 percent. However, it was revealed last week that iOS users should expect to pay a hefty price tag for their next iPhone. A leak last week coincides with Kuo’s latest speculation – it believes the smartphone will feature a front-facing 3D laser scanner to detect the user's face, instead of their fingerprint, in order to provide first-class security. The latest rumors was revealed to MacRumors by Rod Hall, a JPMorgan analyst. Hall noted that replacing the Touch ID, which eliminates the Home button, would leave room for the most predicted feature of the iPhone 8 – an edge-to-edge screen. However, adding the 3D scanner to the design would increase the iPhone 8’s price by $10 to $15 per unit. And all the other cutting-edge technology such as an OLED display, glass casing, wireless charging and more that has been rumored will also add to the price. A leak last week coincides with Kuo’s latest speculation – it believes the smartphone will feature a front-facing 3D laser scanner to detect the user's face, instead of their fingerprint, in order to provide first-class security Other experts have said the smartphone could cost users more than $1,000 (£800) – making it the most expensive handset the firm has ever produced. Hall also revealed that although the facial recognition will look like something out of a sci-fi movie, it will ease the frustration for users when Touch ID doesn’t properly work under wet conditions. He also noted that facial recognition could prove to be more secure, giving users the confidence to use Apple Pay. The note given to MacRumors also suggests the 3D laser scanner could be used for other applications, such as augmented reality. IPHONE 8 RUMORS Several rumors have been circulating about the iPhone 8, and suggest the next device may have: - Dual-lens 3D camera - Augmented reality to generate real-time views of surroundings - Curved glass casing - Plastic OLED screen - Wireless charging - A folding element - New 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimeter) model, which will have a wraparound OLED screen - 5.8 inch will be designed with the Touch ID finger print sensor 'under the glass and in the active display area' - A new 'pure white' model - Aluminum back will be replaced with two reinforced glass panes and a metal frame in the middle - Facial recognition ‘One obvious and potentially most compelling use would be AR/VR experiences in which the user’s hands and other real world objects are being scanned and integrated into a field of view provided by the iPhone mounted into a Google Daydream-like headset,’ Hall wrote in the note. ‘This would open up many interesting entertainment and gaming experiences not available today and might give Apple something extra in an AR/VR accessory compared to Google and others.’ Hall also believes that a 3D scanning API could be on the horizon for developers, which could use it to do ‘everything from determining your shoe size for online orders to helping make sure you are properly fitted on your bike.’ Sticking with Apple’s strict timeline for releasing its products, Hall expects the iPhone to be unveiled later this year – the firm could announced the handset as early as the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5. And this would be the first time Apple has revealed any of its hardware at the conference since 2010.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:56:41.520+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
