S. Rep. John Culberson.\nThe protesters say the country club event excludes many of his constituents who say the congressman has been avoiding their phone calls, emails and town hall meetings.\nThe demonstration at the corner of Lakeside Forest and Wilcrest Drive remained peaceful for the most part, with only a handful of verbal attacks.\nOn the northern corner stood about 20 supporters of President Donald Trump. On the southern corner were about 100 anti-Trump demonstrators.\nHowever, the core issue Wednesday was not Trump.\nThose on the anti-Trump side said they were angry that Culberson opted to hold a town hall meeting that required attendees to purchase tickets.\nFor weeks since the election, many residents say the U.S. representative has avoided meeting with them and not responded to their concerns.\nThose on the pro-Trump side, however, said that the mass protests that have sprung up all over the state and country are the result of overreaction by the Democrats.\n\"They don't realize that Trump is helping to mend the country,\" said Andy Valadez, 52, who had a firearm strapped to his waist.\nValadez is a Trump supporter and attended the demonstration to support Culberson, who he has supported since he's been in office.\nJune McIntosh, 60, said she believes Culberson is ignoring many of his constituents and only listening to those that share his ideologies.\nMcIntosh managed to talk to the representative on the phone recently and said the he seemed open to listening to residents.\n\"I don't think he's an ass, I just don't think he knows how to respond to a large, passionate crowd,\" she said. \"He needs to listen to us and vote the way we ask him, not his party.\"\nHouston residents will rally today in front of Lakeside Country Club in west Houston to protest an appearance by U. S. Rep. John Culberson.\nThe protesters say the country club event excludes many of his constituents who say the congressman has been avoiding their phone calls, emails and town hall meetings.\nThe protest is a joint event hosted between Resist Houston, Greater Houston Democrats and the Human Right Campaign.\nNO CRUZ: Constituents hold rally outside Sen. Ted Cruz's office, without him\nThe gathering is among a growing number of similar protests across the state and nation organized to hold local representatives and members of Congress accountable for their actions in Washington D.C.\nOn Tuesday, more than 200 people gathered outside Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's downtown office, urging him to meet with constituents.\nMany legislators have faced loud opposition at town halls; others, such as Cruz, have not hosted the meetings at all. The Lakeside Country Club protest begins at 10 a.m. at 100 Wilcrest Drive.\nOn Tuesday, a group of global investors advised lawmakers in the state of Texas not to enact legislation restricting access to bathrooms for transgender people, claiming it is discriminatory and bad for business. The bill, which has been called The \"Texas Privacy Act,\" has been marked as a priority for GOP Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick.\nMedia: Brandpoint >>>Scroll through the gallery to see how Texas
