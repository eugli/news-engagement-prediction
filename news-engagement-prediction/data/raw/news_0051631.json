Now, developers have no more excuses to keep on dithering about promoting affordable housing in a big way,\" Naidu said. \n\nThe Minister underscored that infra status for affordable housing would go a long way in placing more cash in the hands of home buyers and act as \"catalyst\" for the growth of low cost housing projects. \n\nWith the ambit of scheme extended by covering people with incomes of up to Rs 18 lakh per year, he said, \"So, the opportunity is knocking at the door. Now, it is for developers to rise to the occasion post Infrastructure status, Real Estate Act and remonetisation. No more excuses I repeat.\" \n\nNaidu directed HUPA Secretary Nandita Chatterjee to soon hold a meeting with all stakeholders, including developers' bodies, banks and housing finance companies, to find out the reasons for the lacklustre response of the private sector to Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) (PMAY-U) scheme. \n\n\"This round table also needs to discuss ways and means, if need be, of improving various components of PMAY (Urban) to encourage private sector participation,\" he said. \n\nNaidu said the Act and remonetisation will give a big push to the housing sector provided the developers \"change their outlook and mindset\" and come out with new business principles and models. \n\n\"It is a fact that this critical sector over the years has acquired a certain degree of taint for several reasons that we are all aware of. There is a serious crisis of character,\" he said, adding that the new realty law seeks to restore the character of the sector. \n\n\"The Benami Transactions (Prevention) Act would further complement in this regard. RERA Act has boosted the entire industry and is definitely proving to be a game changer for the real estate sector,\" he said.
