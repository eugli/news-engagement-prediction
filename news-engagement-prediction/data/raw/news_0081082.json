I got dressed by a personal stylist from an app and she turned me into an adult \nBesides looking pretty, the wonderful thing about fashion is that it has the power to speak volumes without having to utter a single word. \nAnd since the Oscars 2017 was essentially chaos , it was easy to miss the pieces chosen for much more than just their looks. \nThe full list of winners can be found here . \nAva DuVernay, director of Selma and race and justice documentary 13th , made a ‘small sign of solidarity’ by choosing to wear a gown by a designer from a majority Muslim country. \nGrey, lacy and complete with a flared skirt, the frock was created by Ashi Studio based in Lebanon. A small sign of solidarity. I chose to wear a gown by a designer from a majority Muslim country. Thanks to @AshiStudio of Lebanon. #Oscars pic.twitter.com/CbEkK7rCpG \n— Ava DuVernay (@ava) February 27, 2017 \nWhile there was nothing unusual about the gown in itself – it was an elegant, well-chosen piece – there’s something brilliant about centering your entire dress choice around a statement. \nIn light of the US ‘Muslim ban’, it’s a big-yet-subtle public display of her (previously expressed) disapproval of Trump’s prohibited entry to the US from seven majority-Muslim countries. \nAnd Ava wasn’t alone – though other celebrities tended to dedicate just parts of their outfits to their causes. \"I'm wearing an ACLU ribbon because they're fighting incredible fights right now for American ideals.\"– @lin_manuel #Oscars #Oscars2017 pic.twitter.com/pypW1erdQU \n— ACLU National (@ACLU) February 26, 2017 \nRuth Negga (with many others) was spotted with a bright blue ribbon tacked onto her gown with the phrase ‘Stand With ACLU’ (the American Civil Liberties Union) on it. \nThe reasoning behind this ribbon was pretty clear – a statement by ACLU given to People clarified that all guests of the event were encouraged to don the ribbons to show their support ‘for the rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution to everyone in the United States’. \"(The ACLU) helped Richard and Mildred (Loving) change the Constitution & the fight for civil rights.\"– Ruth Negga #Oscars #ThisIsLoving pic.twitter.com/b7QODXG5AS \n— ACLU National (@ACLU) February 27, 2017 \nA tad more vague than Ava’s message, but a message none the less. \nEmma Stone went for something similar (though one that totally matched her outfit better, sorry) by attaching a gold Planned Parenthood pin to her sparkling Givenchy gown.
