The claim must also be supported by an official receipt. \nSkinner, a former elevator mechanic with ThyssenKrupp Elevator Canada has been unable to work since the August 2010 accident. \n“I’m elated, I’m still in shock it’s really still sinking in to be honest with you,” Skinner said in a telephone interview from his home outside Halifax. \nHe argued his own case before the board last October after being denied coverage three times, and said he hoped the inquiry board’s ruling would set a precedent. \n“Hopefully this will help other people in similar situations and eliminate the fight that myself and my family have had to endure and the hardship that this has resulted in.” \nPerryman found that Skinner’s chronic pain has been under-managed as a result of the denial of coverage, resulting in “profoundly negative effects on the complainant and his family.” \nREAD MORE: Marijuana just one element of mental health treatment, users say \nHe also found that the plan’s justification for non-coverage was “wholly inadequate.” \n“There was no evidence presented to suggest that premiums would have to be increased or that the financial viability of the plan would be threatened,” he wrote. \nThe Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association wouldn’t comment on Skinner’s case, but said in general it’s up to employers to decide if they want to cover medical marijuana under their group medical plan. \n“We do not anticipate any impact on group benefit plans as each plan is unique, but will be reviewing the ruling,” the association said in an email. \nFor his part, Skinner said the human rights ruling has lifted a large weight from his shoulders. \n“Just to have that security of knowing that these medications that are absolutely necessary for me to have any functionality are going to be provided for, just alleviates so much stress and hardship on my family,” he said. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T15:11:08.697+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
