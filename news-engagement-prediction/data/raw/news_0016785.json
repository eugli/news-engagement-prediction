Milwaukee Bucks The Milwaukee Bucks are providing new details on an LED message board that will appear above the northwest entrance to their new arena — comparing it with T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas — and adding a “Bucks” sign with benches facing the public plaza east of the new arena. The Bucks’ lead design firm Populous of Kansas City, Mo., disclosed the plans in documents submitted to the Milwaukee Plan Commission. The design modifications are on the agenda for the commission’s Feb. 13 meeting. The LED message board will wrap around the northwest corner entrance to the new arena. Milwaukee Bucks The message board at the northwest entrance on North Sixth Street and West Juneau Avenue will wrap around the corner of the arena, according to the documents. The board will look like a glass wall during the daytime due to “visual porosity” but light up with messages in the dark, Populous said in its letter to the plan commission. Besides showing photos of T-Mobile Arena as a comparable example, the Bucks design firm shows photos of Wembley Stadium in London. The Bucks LED signage will be 15 feet tall by 85 feet wide, which is significantly smaller than the T-Mobile Arena LED presentation. The Bucks intend to use the LED display for “community messaging” and submitted an image with an example of a message for Visit Milwaukee. The additional “monument sign” will be built outside the arena near the intersection of North Fourth Street and West Highland Avenue. It will face both the south entrance to the public plaza on Fourth Street and the Bucks planned entertainment block east of the arena. The sign will be built upon a concrete base and consist of the letters “B-U-C-K-S” made of fabricated aluminum. The letters will be nearly 12 feet tall. Behind the sign and attached to the large letters will be benches where fans can sit and take photos.
