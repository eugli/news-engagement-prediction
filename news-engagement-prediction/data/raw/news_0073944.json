Related Content Trump's choice of Stephen Bannon for strategist elicits howls of outrage \nThis was CPAC, standing for Conservative Political Action Conference, where audience members have staged walkouts in the past because the likes of former Florida governor and failed presidential hopeful Jeb Bush was deemed to be not conservative enough. \nThousands of delegates come from across the country, and this year they are finding Washington a new fit. As they eagerly awaited Trump's scheduled speech on Friday, many seemed to forget that a few years ago they had booed him. Advertisement \nOthers too have come full circle - Breitbart News , controlled by Bannon till last year, used to host an event for the uninvited, those who were ejected or not given a speaking gig, but this year as many as seven Breitbart employees are listed as speakers or panelists. \nThe conservative jamboree coincides with a series of polls that can be expected to anger Trump.

And though a majority saw him as intelligent, a majority also declared that he did not share their values. \nBannon was enthusiastic in his depiction of a White House at war with vested interests: \"the corporatist, globalist media are adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda that Donald Trump has\".

If you think they're going to give you your country back without a fight, you're sadly mistaken. \n\"Every day is going to be a fight. That is the promise of Donald Trump ... All the people who've came in and said you've got to moderate. Every day in the Oval Office he tells Reince and I: 'I committed this to the American people, I promised this when I ran, and I'm going to deliver on this.'\" SHARE White nationalist Richard Spencer. Photo: Twitter/@TheeCurrentYear \nBannon, who speaks of his West Wing office as \"the war room\", stayed on the attack: \"If you look at the opposition party and how they portrayed the campaign, how they portrayed the transition, how they portrayed the administration, it's always wrong…you saw them all crying and weeping [on election] night.\" \nDescribing Trump's abandonment of the Trans-Pacific Partnership \"one of the most pivotal moments of modern American history,\" Bannon set out the Trump agenda as three \"verticals\" – national security and sovereignty; economic nationalism; and \"deconstruction of the administrative state.\" \nThere was nothing convoluted in Bannon's language. But just to be sure, The Washington Post 's Chris Cillizza offered a translation: \"The message from Bannon was unmistakable: The enemy of Donald Trump and those who think like him is not, really, Democrats but, in actuality, the media. And the only way to combat the media is to fight like hell against them on everything and anything. \n\"Bannon doesn't want to change the media. He wants to totally dismantle the media. He wants to break its back and leave it for dead by the side of the road. And he's not afraid of telling the media to their faces about that plan.\" \nBut not everyone gets their way at CPAC. Alt-right movement leader and white supremacist Richard Spencer , who has been a delegate in previous years, was shown the door after CPAC executive director Dan Schneider declared from the lectern: \"There is a sinister organisation that is trying to worm its way into our ranks – we must not be deceived by [a] hateful, left-wing fascist group.\" \nIt counted for nothing that Bannon, who after Trump is this year's second most loved CPAC darling, last year declared Breitbart to be \"the platform of the Alt-right\". \nAs Spencer spoke to reporters, a delegate who identified himself as \"Grizzly Joe\" interrupted with this message for Spencer: \"F--- you, you don't represent us. Get the f--- out of here. You don't represent us. You're a piece of shit. I hope everybody got that. You're a f---ng piece of shit. He's a f---ng white supremacist piece of shit.\" Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T08:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:04:37.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
