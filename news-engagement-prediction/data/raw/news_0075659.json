And then the fun started, as some of the riders started their bikes and lined up to give the residents rides around the extensive centre grounds. \nWe take the wind in our faces, the vibration and the swooping from side to side for granted, but the expressions of awe and wonder on the faces of these first-time pillions reminded many of the rallygoers just why we ride motorcycles. \nLeisurely ride \nWith the formal part of the rally done and dusted, it was time for a leisurely ride back to the campsite for lunch, socialising and games. Well, leisurely for some, anyway; we latched on to the back of a very professional group of BMW riders who were soon cruising, in perfect staggered formation, almost exactly at the speed limit. \nShe Who Must be Obeyed had only one complaint about that exhilarating ride down the R60 to Robertson – it was too short! \nSoon the bikes were parked in the shade of the resort’s trees and the ladies got down to some serious partying, in between lunch from one of several food stalls, trying on bike-related jewellery, laughing at each others’ choice of T-shirt slogan (my favourite was one that read, “Witches used to ride brooms - now they ride bikes”) and swopping stories about their rides to the rally. \nMore than 270 entries \nThe 2017 Rally in the Valley was the biggest yet, with more than 270 entries from all over South Africa, such as petite sixtysomething Ria de Klerk, who rode her BMW R1200 GS - alone! - from her home in Pretoria to Herolds Bay in the Northern Cape, took a sho’t left and rode down the West Coast to the rally, arriving with an impressive 2500km on her tripmeter. \nBy the time she gets home she will have ridden 5000km - and she reckons that’s just a jaunt in the country compared to her previous safari, an 8000km ride to Malawi and back. \nA group of about a dozen survivors and supporters from Cancervive were doing their best to live up to the organisation’s mantra, “Celebrate life!” – although they were no match for Lauren Cloete of Icarus Chase and the Boob Tube team, who won the tug-of-war contest for the fourth consecutive year. \nCelebrity blogger, stunt rider and track racer Skinny van Schalkwyk was a quiet inspiration with her understated persona - until she got on a bike, giving the ladies an impromptu stunt show on a Harley-Davidson that she’d seen before, let alone ridden. \nReally loud \nThen things got really loud, with live music and a cowgirl themed line-dance party, interspersed with cheers and applause for the winners of the concours, judged, appropriately, by She Who Has the Casting Vote, and more than R35 000 worth of raffle prizes. \nAll too soon, it was Sunday morning, time to pack the bikes and head home, with heartfelt hugs all round and promises of “next year”, when ladies from 17 to 70, will be drawn together again from far and wide by their common love of motorcycling. \nSkinny van Schalkwyk gave the ladies an impromptu stunt show.
