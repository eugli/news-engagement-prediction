They thought when my acting career is going good why am I getting into production. As usually actresses become producers when they don’t have anything to do (in acting) which I felt was bizarre and stupid,” she added.\nAnushka said she does not pay much heed to what other people say and rather believes in taking her own decisions.\n“I don’t do things to break stereotypes but I just follow what my heart says. I don’t get scared easily. If I want to do something and I feel it is correct I will do it. I don’t think what others will say or think about my decision.”\nThough, Anushka has tasted immense success in Bollywood, she says “the only time I felt good was when I bought my house.”\n“I felt very accomplished. Of course, people notice you and all of that but I felt very awkward about it when that happened. I did not know how to react when people started recognising me.\n “I was like what am I suppose to do? How am I suppose to behave? If you always wanted to be an actor you visualise people coming to you and taking autographs. But when you did not want to be an actor you get worried what am I suppose to do,” she added.\nThe actress is now all set for the release of her second production “Phillauri” also starring Diljit Dosanjh and Suraj Sharma.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:10:20.463+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
