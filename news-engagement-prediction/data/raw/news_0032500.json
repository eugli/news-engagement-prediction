The game was essentially over in the third, when Thunder coach Billy Donovan tried calling three early timeouts that did nothing to get his team going. \nIt was 91-57 after a 3 by Porter with 6:20 left in the third, and Westbrook took a seat at the end of his team’s bench and did not return. \nWATCH: John Wall’s Unbelievable Through-the-Legs Pass \n“The focus was to stop Westbrook. Obviously, if you cut the head, the body will fall with that team,” said Wizards forward Markieff Morris, who scored 23 points. \nWestbrook entered averaging 31.2 points, 10.6 rebounds and 10.2 assists. But he equaled his second-lowest scoring total of the season on 5-for-19 shooting and added only four rebounds and four assists. He missed nine straight field-goal attempts during that eye-opening drought when the Thunder were being outscored 32-5 from the second quarter to the third. \n“I mean, he’s human. He can have a tough night,” said Thunder guard Victor Oladipo, who was 0 for 3 on 3s and scored six points. “But the rest of us — we’ve got to step up and play.” \nMaybe Westbrook and Co. were simply spent, physically and emotionally. They beat LeBron James and defending champion Cleveland on Thursday, then lost to former teammate Kevin Durant and Golden State on Saturday. \n“I don’t know if I’d use the word ‘hangover,’ but I think I made the comment before the game — someone asked me about the emotional part, and I was worried about it. I was,” Donovan said. “We talked about it, and we were not at the level that I’ve seen our guys at.” \nDidn’t help that the Wizards were terrific from the outset on the way to their 19th victory in their past 20 home games, and 10th win in their past 11 games overall. With Wall directing the show, Washington opened 9 for 9, capped by Morris’ 3 that made it 22-6 after all of 3 1/2 minutes. \nTIP-INS \nThunder: Westbrook’s season low for points is 14, in a victory over Miami in November. \nWizards: Beal’s first 3 gave him a career high for makes from behind the arc in a season, 139, with 28 games remaining. \nBEAL’S DEAL \nBeal shot 7 for 8, drawing this compliment from Wizards coach Scott Brooks: “Certain guys, you can just see it. Once it leaves his hand, you know it’s going in. I don’t even know if he hit rim on any of his shots.” \nUP NEXT \nThunder: Host New York on Wednesday. \nWizards: At Indiana on Thursday. \nFollow 106.7 The Fan on Twitter \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
