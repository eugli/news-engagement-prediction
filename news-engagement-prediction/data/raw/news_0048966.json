He is set to be sidelined for up to three months, with Guardiola comparing the loss of the Brazilian to Ilkay Gundogan's long-term problems with fitness, per the Daily Star 's Marc Williams : \" I am sad and also I am sad for him. Like [Ilkay] Gundogan, we miss them a lot, it's tough for them. But we had seven strikers, we are going to use another one and of course Sergio [Aguero] will be so important for us.\" Attacking midfielder Gabriel Boschilia will be absent for Monaco as he recovers from a cruciate injury, per The Sun 's Richard Forrester . Likely Manchester City XI: Caballero; Sagna, Stones, Otamendi, Clichy; Toure, De Bruyne, Silva; Sterling, Aguero, Sane Likely Monaco XI: Subasic; Toure, Glik, Jemerson, Mendy; Bernardo Silva, Fabinho, Moutinho, Lemar; Falcao, Germain Preview Laurence Griffiths/Getty Images With Arsenal having lost the first leg of their last-16 tie 5-1 to Bayern Munich and Leicester City in a rotten run of form that has seen them edge closer to the Premier League's relegation zone, Guardiola's Sky Blues are England's best hope of going far in this season's Champions League. While they avoided any of Europe's historic giants in the draw for the round of 16, they face a huge challenge to get past Monaco. Leonardo Jardim's side have been irresistible in 2016-17 and have netted a staggering 76 goals in 26 games to move them to the top of Ligue 1. The French outfit will be confident they can bag an important away goal at the Etihad Stadium, although they did not look at their best as they drew 1-1 with Bastia in Ligue 1 on Friday, per football writer Robin Bairner: Robin Bairner @RBairner Monaco 1-0 down away to Bastia, who are without their best 2 attackers. ASM not looking sharp - good news for Man City. #MCFC 2/17/2017, 8:44:01 PM City do not want to go to Stade Louis II on March 15 needing a win to advance, as Monaco have won 13 of their last 14 home games in all competitions. Guardiola's side have the personnel to overturn Monaco in Manchester and — the draw with Huddersfield aside — are in decent form having won their last three league games on the bounce. Aguero will be vital in converting any chances City can create, and the 28-year-old is enjoying a fine season, netting 11 goals in 19 Premier League games and three in the Champions League, per WhoScored.com . YANN COATSALIOU/Getty Images Monaco have their own hotshot marksman in the shape of former Manchester United and Chelsea loanee Radamel Falcao. After a dismal two-season spell in the Premier League, the Colombia international has looked back to his best in 2016-17, scoring 16 times in the league at a rate of better than a goal a game, per WhoScored . The attacking strength in both squads should make for an entertaining clash at the Etihad on Tuesday as the two teams look to earn a key advantage for the second leg.
