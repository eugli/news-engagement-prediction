They cited a report by a Senate committee that was critical of for-profit education.\nASU's Crow and University of Arizona President Ann Weaver Hart were among those who signed the letter. \nCrow told The Arizona Republic at the time, \"It's challenging enough to balance academics and athletics. We are against using athletics as a mechanism to make profits. It's contrary to what we're trying to do.\"\nCrow told The Republic in 2013 that he instructed his athletic department-personnel not to schedule games in any sports against GCU.\nThe letter, and its fallout, made national news. GCU President and CEO Brian Mueller accused Crow of orchestrating an effort to block the school's move into Division I.\nMueller released his own statement, touting Grand Canyon's accomplishments, including a growing traditional student body and millions of dollars spent refurbishing the Phoenix campus. As to criticisms that for-profit schools put shareholders before profits, university officials have countered that GCU has not raised tuition in several years and athletic programs operate at a loss.\nTopic still touchy The topic is still a sensitive one at both schools four years later.\nNewly hired coaches at ASU quickly learn the backstory about why they're not supposed to schedule games against the school. ASU is in the Pac-12 Conference while GCU is in the smaller Western Athletic Conference. Both are affiliated with NCAA's Division I.\nSeveral other Pac-12 schools schedule non-conference games against GCU, including Stanford in softball, UCLA in men's tennis and beach volleyball and University of Washington in women's basketball and softball.\nTwo of the three state universities in Arizona schedule non-conference games against GCU in certain sports: Arizona and Northern Arizona University.\nGCU competed against Arizona this year in tennis, beach volleyball, track and field, cross country and golf.\nArizona played men's basketball against GCU for the first time since 1980 in December. The Wildcats scored a 64-54 victory despite having 19 turnovers.\nWildcats head coach Sean Miller said he didn't play GCU to help build their program.\n\"We played their team because we respect them,\" he said at post-game press conference. \"They had 27 wins last year. They have a couple of guys injured, and on a given night, they can beat anybody. They’re going to be really good in their conference.

Until that is settled at a different level, I’m not going to be scheduling (games against Grand Canyon).\"\nSo has Crow changed his mind or do things remain status quo?\n\"We don't have any plans to change our scheduling approach,\" said a statement issued by ASU.\nAs for Grand Canyon's president, he said he would welcome playing ASU.\nMueller said that he has the greatest respect for ASU. Two of his sons graduated from ASU, and the oldest played on the university's golf team.\n“We remain open to the possibility of the two institutions competing in not only athletics but debate and other areas. It would create a lot of interest in the Valley and state and also save on travel costs,\" he said in a statement.\nRepublic reporter Richard Obert contributed to this story. \nReach the reporter at 602-444-8072 or anne.ryman@arizonarepublic.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:25:38.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
