Citizenship, he said, could be one of the most innovative policy tools for any European Union member state. It could make Europe unbeatable in the global race of the future. \nHe then proposed a European social pact saying that now was the time for Europe to show it got it, by agreeing to a European Social Pact that had to be the cornerstone to a social union aimed at promoting all types of equalities and social mobility. \nDr Muscat proposed a European Integration Brexit Fund saying there needed to be a political agreement that a substantial part of the exit fee that had to be settled, or its equivalent, be used to create a new European fund which would invest in communities which felt most detached from the European project. \nHis final proposal was for the opening of negotiations on Chapter 24 with Turkey saying that if the European Union was so worried about human rights and freedom of expression in Turkey, it should open discussion on the chapter dealing with justice, freedom and security. « Man kept under house arrest Pregnant salesgirl gets fright of her life as thief enters shop and demands money » Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=43919652281&n=b5190d52' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=43919652281&n=b5190d52' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
