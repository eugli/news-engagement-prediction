Madelaine Empson, who writes for Regional News , was so appalled by the play Manifesto 2083 , which delves into the writings of Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik, that she cancelled her review. \nInstead, Empson wrote: \"I refuse to review Manifesto 20183, because it is a deeply offensive and problematic show. I will not be giving Anders Breivik any more of the airtime that he so desperately craves and does not deserve.\" NTB SCANPIX \nMass murderer Anders Behring Breivik raises his right hand during the appeal case in Borgarting Court of Appeal at Telemark prison in Skien, Norway. \nThe play was written by Christian Lollike, Olaf Hojgaard and Tanja Diers. This month's Circa production was directed by Anders Falstie-Jensen, and starred Aucklander Edwin Wright as the solo actor. \nREAD MORE * Controversial Anders Breivik play coming to NZ \nWright plays the part of Olaf Hojgaard, who has delved into the manifesto and the whole scary philosophy behind Breivik's actions. On July 22, 2011, the Norwegian set off a bomb in Oslo, before going on to nearby Utoya Island and shooting a group of young people at a Workers Youth League summer camp, killing a total of 77 people in all. \nEmpson said her decision to not review the play was a \"nerve-wracking move, but what I decided ultimately was to make a stance and say no, it's not okay to perform a play like that\". \n\"I would like to say that it was an incredible performance, absolutely. Edwin Wright is an amazing actor, and it utilised all the conventions of solo performance brilliantly. It was just the actual content. I was deeply offended by it. If I could have left, I would have.\" ﻿ Ad Feedback \nEmpson said Breivik, who is jailed in a Norwegian prison, compiled the manifesto before he went on his mass-murdering spree, and he wanted it to be widely distributed in the public realm as he wanted to effect change. \n\"Firstly, I had a problem with seeing a mass murderer being idealised and glorified on stage. The character himself was slowly becoming so morbidly fascinated by (Breivik's) ideas he effectively became him. We were lectured on the manifesto. It was written on the whiteboard; there were photographs about the crime scene. I didn't sign up to go to see this show to be lectured on the manifesto.\" \nAUDIENCE DISCRIMINATION \nEmpson said the character then handed out the assimilation policy to everyone of colour in the audience. \n\"That was pretty disgusting. The lights went on; he walked up slowly and specifically found people of colour and gave them an assimilation policy. We were effectively watching discrimination, hatred, and racism live on stage. You had to have a damn good reason for it and they didn't.\" \nEmpson said the current global climate made it all the more offensive. \"At the moment we have a White Supremist in the White House, and the public has voted him in. There's a Muslim ban and obvious global outrage.\" \nActor Edwin Wright said on his Facebook page \"The irony(?) is that her position clearly illustrates two of the fundamental issues 'plaguing' modern society that Breivik condemns: Political correctness, and censorship. And here's the thing; someone could write a full review of the play without identifying Breivik once... she wrote a two sentence non-review, her justification of which being not giving him 'airtime' , and yet managed to name him in under 40 words.\" \nSpeaking on Saturday, Wright said he had no problem with being critiqued and would always take criticism on board. And he acknowledged the play was deliberately confronting and challenging, but believed there was a need to open up the discussion. \n\"Breivik's manifesto is not just his words – it's a portrait of a movement that is growing right now.\" Wright said the team struggled to work out how to present the material to the audience, and chose to hand out the flyers, discriminating the audience in the process. \n\"This was the most powerful way to get the message across. Because they are only handed out to people of different ethnicities, there is a sense that it makes white people complicit (which also makes them uncomfortable). We have even had white people pass these on. In four seasons of presenting this play I have only ever had two women, both of an ethnic race, refuse to accept a flyer.\" \nWright said he was approached after the play by people who were in Norway when the tragedy unfolded. \"Most of them have found it to be a very cathartic experience and they are grateful for having the chance to see things through his eyes. It's very easy to say someone is a monster and crazy, but that doesn't help anyone to understand.\" \nKiwi actor Peter Elliott has also joined in the discussion. \"I suspect her ego got in the way of her brain. By taking a 'stance' she has merely articulated that her prose is worth more than the aggregated talents of a wonderful writer, the gifted director and exemplary actor. When she has put in a twentieth of the effort of any one of the creatives, she might have a point, but she is paid for her opinion of the work not for holding an opinion of her own,\" he said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:57:00.091+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
