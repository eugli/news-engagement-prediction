The unemployment rate is currently 4.7 percent, at or near the level many policymakers consider to be full employment. \nThe central bank raised rates in December for only the second time in a decade and forecast three rate increases in 2017. The Fed is still awaiting clarity on the possible impact of Trump’s economic policies. \nFed Chair Janet Yellen recently underscored that with the economy near full employment, the Fed risked a “nasty surprise” on inflation if it is too slow with rate hikes. \nThe Fed said in its statement it still expects inflation to rise to its 2 percent target in the medium term, although it noted that market-based measures of inflation compensation are still low and survey-based measures of long-term inflation expectations are little changed. It did however indicate that the effects of weak oil prices had ended, something that will give it a “clean” inflation reading going forward. \nOn Monday, the Commerce Department reported an uptick in inflation to 1.7 percent. \n“The economy continues to chug along and sentiment has improved. The Fed does sound more confident about eventually getting to its 2 percent inflation target,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management. \nInvestors had all but ruled out a rate increase this week, given the uncertainty surrounding Trump’s fiscal and trade policies and how they would affect the Fed’s outlook. \nFinancial markets were little changed after the rate decision. \nTrump’s promises on infrastructure spending, tax cuts, regulation rollbacks and a renegotiation of trade deals could quickly spur higher inflation, which may necessitate a faster pace of rate hikes. \nThe businessman-turned-politician has offered few details on his economic plans or a timeline for their rollout, while the announcement of policies viewed by many as protectionist and an immigration crackdown have caused market jitters. \n(Reporting by Lindsay Dunsmuir and Jason Lange; Editing by Paul Simao) Share This:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T00:12:03.987+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
