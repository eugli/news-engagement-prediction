Trump said last year women should face punishment if they receive abortions.\n\"It's back to 17th century puritan values of new England at that time in which women were pretty low on the hierarchy\".\nThe first person narrator of \"The Handmaid's Tale\" tries to escape to Canada. Some have already taken refuge there since Trump's election, Atwood said, adding that it had historically been seen as a place of relative safety.\nIn the TV adaptation that debuts in April and features \"Mad Men\" star Elisabeth Moss, Atwood plays a cameo role.\nDystopian fiction is enjoying a moment. George Orwell's \"1984\", first published in 1949, ranks third on Amazon's best seller list.\nThe classic book features an authoritarian government that spies on its citizens and forces them into \"doublethink,\" or simultaneously accepting contradictory versions of the truth.\nSales spiked two weeks ago after a senior White House official, Kellyanne Conway, used the term \"alternative facts\", an expression some denounced as \"Orwellian\".\n\"We think as progress being a straight line forever upwards,\" said Atwood. \"But it never has been so, you can think you are being a liberal democracy but then bang you're Hitler's Germany, that can happen very suddenly”\nCuba and Canada were alike in that they were small countries that both keenly felt the impact of international politics, said the author, who has made regular trips to the Caribbean island since a first cultural exchange in the 1980s.\nBirdwatching was one of the activities that kept her, and her partner and writer Graeme Gibson, coming back.\nSeveral new editions of her books are being presented at the Cuba book fair, which runs until Feb. 19 and in which nearly 50 countries are participating.\n\n(Reporting by Sarah Marsh; Editing by Andrew Hay)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T14:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T14:20:45.480+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
