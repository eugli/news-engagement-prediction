The city’s Small Business Services Department operates the pipeline, which has already placed more than 750 students in internships and tech training programs.\nNow the city is expanding the program by offering new tech apprenticeships and internships at companies including IBM, Verizon and Accenture. That brings the total number of companies working in various aspects of the initiative to 175.\nPipeline also works with 15 city colleges, including Columbia University, the City University of New York and Cornell Tech. Lehman College recently joined the program that’s geared toward younger New Yorkers who are trying to break into the middle class.\n“The NYC Tech Talent Pipeline is centered on providing new opportunities,” de Blasio said. “Those impacted by this initiative will gain the skills and experiences they need to be a part of one of the fastest-growing sectors of our economy.”\nPeople who have completed a pipeline training program have seen an average 34% increase in their wages, a spokesman for the Small Business Services Department said. The initiative’s 10 programs target various demographics, including college students and underemployed or unemployed New Yorkers.\nWith the additions of Accenture, Verizon and IBM, the program is now involved with 175 companies. (PR NEWSWIRE) Lois Tatis, 24, of Brooklyn, participated in a pipeline training program at Manhattan’s Flatiron school. After finishing in December 2015, the former sales rep landed a coding job at Manhattan startup LearnVest.\n“I never saw tech as a viable career,” said Tatis, who’s tripled his old salary at his new job. “These programs are huge because they bring awareness that technology is a path.”\nThe city’s tech sector is one of the fastest-growing aspects of the local economy, with more than twice as many New Yorkers employed in it over the last decade, according to Manhattan-based Center for an Urban Future.\nTech is one of five economic sectors de Blasio has targeted for an infusion of local workers with the small-business department. The others are construction, food service and hospitality, industry and health care.\nThe project is part of de Blasio’s larger effort to provide more middle class jobs to New Yorkers, a spokesman for the Small Business Services Department said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T05:36:55.269+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
