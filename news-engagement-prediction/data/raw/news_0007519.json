Mara's daughter and her boyfriend, Mashele were sitting outside in his car when she heard gunshots. \n\"In my mind I was like 'who is still playing with firecrackers this time?' But after the second and third shots, I realised that it was a gun,\" Mara told the paper. \nThe former Idols SA judge added that she immediately panicked and started screaming for her daughter. Two years on: 'He's left a massive Simba shaped hole in my life,' says Jonathan Boynton-Lee \n\"On my way to the gate I saw her come in. We checked on her boyfriend who was shot in the arm. He was bleeding profusely. I have never seen so much blood come out of a human being,\" Mara added. \nMashele died in hospital two days after the incident.
