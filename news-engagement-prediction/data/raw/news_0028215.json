I was in a lot of pain and if they feel you are depressed or a danger to yourself they can hold you on a 5150,” she explained. \nRELATED: Kanye accused of faking breakdown \n“I am terrified of needles and they wanted to pump me full of drugs and I said, 'No, absolutely not. I don't want to be here,' and got into a fight with the nurses, and that led to my 5150. \n\"Part of me wishes those things had never happened in the public eye. I wish I could have been perfect. For ages after that 5150 I'd walk down the street and people would give me the crazy eye: 'There's Mischa Barton, she's insane, isn't she?'\" Close Mischa Barton blames the music for Dancing with the Stars disaster UP NEXT ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:53:16.573+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
