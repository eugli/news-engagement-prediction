Ian MacDonald said in a statement.\n1 dead, 3 in custody in Abbotsford, B.C., shooting Police say those affiliated with gangs are also putting other people in their lives — such as friends and family — at risk. They warn that it's not safe to \"be in the company\" of gang members.\n\"Although this may appear to be common-sense advice, we believe that now it could also be a life-saving decision that we need you to make,\" said MacDonald.\nThe warning comes after a shooting last Monday killed a 23-year-old man. Police say Satkar Sidhu was shot multiple times in an incident that was linked to gang violence. Sidhu didn't have a criminal record but was known to police.\nGiven the escalating situation, Abbotsford police are encouraging anyone with information to call the service's Gang Tip Line or Crime Stoppers.\n\n\nWith files from CBC News © The Canadian Press, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T17:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:09:41.602+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
