Gibbons started the band in late 1969 and the pieces soon came together.\nFARRAH HAD IT: The hidden Houston connection to a classic R&B radio hit\nHouston fans will get to see ZZ Top back in action next month as the band is slated to play RodeoHouston on Tuesday, March 21 at NRG Stadium. The band turned in a raucous set last weekend at Super Bowl Live festivities in downtown Houston.\nBack in 2015 bassist Hill told Chron.com via email that he had to borrow a pivotal piece of stage equipment to play the show.\n\"I had to borrow a bass for that gig. I didn't actually own one. It was the Knights of Columbus Hall and though I didn't meet any knights or royalty, there were a lot of cool people who came out to hear us play,\" Hill wrote. \"And so it began...\"\nIt's not every day that ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons wonders over to Wall Street, but he did today to help promote a benefit concert Friday night in New York. The group Wall Street Rocks is holding a concert to raise money for military veterans and first responders. Gibbons joins other performers at the event, including John Popper of Blues Traveler, and Matt Sorum of Guns N' Roses. The group Wall Street Rocks is a collaboration of employees in the financial, technology and entertainment industries. The concert is being held at the Highline Ballroom in New York. Video provided by TheStreet\nMedia: Brandpoint In those early days they also played a handful of proms and sanctioned high school parties, probably warping hundreds of young Texans for decades to come.\nTHE VERY FIRST TOP: The story of ZZ Top’s first album\nA picture of the band at the Little Cypress-Mauriceville High School prom in Orange made the rounds years back over on Reddit. It’s probably the closest picture one will find of the band when it was just a few months old. A “yearbook club error” had them billed as “Zee Zee Top” in the photo.\nA year or so after that first gig in Beaumont the band released its debut album simply titled “ZZ Top’s First Album” on U.K. label London Records.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/36/11/15/7902021/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/27/24/32/6112939/9/920x920.jpg",
