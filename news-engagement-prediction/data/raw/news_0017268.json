The police arrested Mr. Lewis in the murder of Karina Vetrano after a DNA match. Credit Brian Harkin for The New York Times A day after the arrest of a 20-year-old man in the August murder of a jogger in Howard Beach, Queens, the police said that the forensic evidence linking him to the crime was strong and that there were no other suspects. “Everything we have revolves around one person,” Robert K. Boyce, the New York Police Department’s chief of detectives, said at a news conference Monday. “We only have one DNA profile in this case, and that’s him.” The man, Chanel Lewis, 20, remained at the Manhattan Detention Complex on Monday, where he was being held without bail. He was arrested Saturday and charged with the Aug. 2 murder of Karina Vetrano, 30, who was jogging in Spring Creek Park when she was beaten, strangled and left 15 feet from the trail. Mr. Lewis was, in appearance and background, an unlikely suspect. There was no reason to believe he knew Ms. Vetrano or had seen her before, the police said; the man’s family insisted he was innocent. Baby-faced, his sweater bulging over what appeared to be a bulletproof vest, Mr. Lewis was led by detectives from the 107th Precinct station house to a waiting vehicle on Sunday as onlookers shouted questions and jeers. He looked far younger than the image of a man in a sketch that was released in August, when the police believed the suspect to be about twice Mr. Lewis’s age. \nAdvertisement   The police said he had no record of violence. Chief Boyce said Mr. Lewis had been given summonses three times, twice for Parks Department violations and once for urinating in public. But on Monday, Chief Boyce said that the DNA samples taken from Mr. Lewis were “strong profiles” that matched evidence from the victim’s body and her cellphone. He compared the case to finding “a needle in a haystack” and described how the trail to Mr. Lewis had begun. In May, an off-duty lieutenant, John Russo, noticed a man behaving suspiciously in Howard Beach, where he lives, and called the police. Officers arrived and found Mr. Lewis and recorded his information, Chief Boyce said. Ten days ago, Lieutenant Russo remembered that episode and told detectives. “We drilled down on that,” Chief Boyce said, adding that for all the police knew, it could have been just another dead-end lead in the case. There were 1,700 investigative reports filed in the case, with 250 leads, he said. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.
