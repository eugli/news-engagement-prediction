Rec Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports Baltimore Ravens safety Matt Elam was arrested early Sunday morning by Miami-Dade police on multiple drug charges. The charges include possession of more than 20 grams of cannabis, possession of cannabis with the intent to sell or deliver, and possession of a controlled substance. The arrest report indicates that police initially pulled Elam over for reckless driving. They found 126 grams of marijuana — over a third of a pound — in his vehicle, according to Pro Football Talk’s Michael David Smith . Elam also had three grams of oxycodone in his possession, which explains the possession of a controlled substance charge. According to the arrest report, Elam’s bond on each of the drug-related charges is currently set at $5,000. His bond for the reckless driving charge is an additional $500. Those amounts are subject to change. After spending the first several weeks of the season recovering from knee surgery, Elam was designated for return from injured reserve by the Ravens. He played in the final nine games of the season, posting four tackles. Elam was selected by the Ravens with the 32nd pick in the 2013 NFL draft , and the Ravens declined to pick up his option prior to the 2016 season. He is set to enter free agency in March. This arrest may make free agency a challenge for Elam.
