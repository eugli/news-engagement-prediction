(City of Ottawa)\nIn 2015 the city had made changes to zoning to allow light commercial uses on a number of streets downtown, but community leaders in Hintonburg wanted to hold off on that change until they could figure how best to integrate the new commercial zone with the existing neighbourhood.\nThe change comes after a year of consultation by the Wellington West Business Improvement Area, the Hintonburg Community Association and Kitchissippi Coun. Jeff Leiper.\nThe vision is for Armstrong Street, which runs parallel to Wellington West, to permit building heights on the south side of up to six storeys if there are commercial businesses on the ground floor, with step-backs for buildings higher than three storeys.\nCycling and pedestrian traffic would also be encouraged, with bike lanes and bike parking installed on Carruthers and Merton.\nWhile Armstrong Street has added residential buildings on its north side, its south side has remained a patchwork of parking lots and underutilized space. (Google)\nKemp said that as the neighbourhood has grown in popularity, rental prices on Wellington West have become less affordable for new businesses.\nHaving a parallel street with lower rents would encourage smaller, newer businesses to move in and add to the neighbourhood, while at the same time bringing more potential customers to Wellington West.\n\"We think it's very important for not only for Hintonburg, but also the whole Wellington West area, as a stimulator and incubator of new businesses,\" Kemp said last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:28:35.794+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
