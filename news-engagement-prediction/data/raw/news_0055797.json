Analysis by BBC Business news reporter Matthew Davies \nThe big question analysts will now ask is, has Pravin Gordhan done enough to stave off a downgrade from the ratings agencies? \nThe likes of Moody's and Standard & Poor's, which pronounce on South Africa's sovereign debt in April and June, were watching closely. \nThe finance minister said the economy would grow by 1.3% this year, which, by his own admission, is not good enough. \nHe said the deficit would be 3.1% of GDP, but that would fall in subsequent years. But the question remains...will the deficit fall fast enough and will economic growth pick up? \nThe future is, however, uncertain. With an increasingly combative political climate within the ruling ANC, analysts say that if he does lose his job in a widely-predicted cabinet reshuffle, this budget and some of its prudent measures, will completely unravel. \nAnd that, it's thought, will seal the deal for a series of credit downgrades and the accompanying market turmoil. \nMr Gordhan also warned of \"growing impatience and ferment\" over post-apartheid inequality and said: \"Economic growth is slow, unemployment is far too high and many businesses and families are under stress. \n\"The relationships between labour and capital, rich and poor, black and white still reflect the entrenched legacy of colonialism and apartheid.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:42:22.128+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
