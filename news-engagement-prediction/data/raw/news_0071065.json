Photo: Facebook \nHe did not mention, or perhaps recall, that he had been pictured during the election campaign with Mr Hunter who was then a campaign volunteer for Labor's Emma Husar, who won the Penrith-based seat of Lindsay back from the Liberal Party. \nMr Shorten's office declined to comment. \nOn social media, Mr Hunter has referred to Ms Husar as his \"greatest friend\" and travelled to Canberra for her inaugural speech. \nAccording to his Facebook page, Mr Hunter in November received the \"Young Achiever Award\" from the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association, known as the shoppies. \n\"I urge all workers to join the union,\" he posted. \nDuring Mr Shorten's press conference, he said the Fair Work Commission's decision was a \"disgrace\". \n\"I rely on the penalty rates to make ends meet and to pay for my fuel, my rent and to pay for my food,\" he said. \n\"I am gutted. It is such a disgrace. I do not accept the decision as a retail worker. I urge all workers today, because it is a dark day for retail workers and hospitality workers, to stand up and fight back. \n\"I urge all workers to stand up, join your union and fight back so we can win back our penalty rates.\" \nFairfax Media has contacted Mr Hunter for comment and also contacted Ms Husar. \nA Labor source said Mr Hunter believed Thursday's decision was going to be bad for him \"either immediately or in the long term\".
