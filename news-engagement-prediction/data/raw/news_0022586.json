Now a Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) deployed robot suffered damages owing to these excessively high levels of radiation.\nBlack Mirror coming true? Tiny drones to replace bees as pollinators in Japan\nIt was the first time that a robot had entered the reactor since the earthquake and tsunami disaster six years ago. It was sent inside to inspect and clean a passage of the damaged reactor, but just two hours into its deployment the camera began to fail.\nThe robot only covered a part of the course it was supposed to take while removing debris with a scraper. Had it entered deeper into the reactor it may have been completely destroyed. Its operators aborted the mission before losing complete control of the probe.\nNew Zealand: 400 whales wash up dead in 3rd largest mass beaching in country's history\nTEPCO was scheduled to send it a second robot, Scorpion, for the same task. But now they are examining the failed robot and will only then decide whether to deploy the robot further or not.\n\"We will further study Thursday's outcome before deciding on the deployment of the scorpion,\" said TEPCO spokesman Takahiro Kimoto.\nSurrogacy: Where does the UK stand and should the law be reformed?\nThe latest incident reflects a larger hoard of challenges in decommissioning the wrecked nuclear plant including the limitation of subsequent probes that may require more radiation-resistant cameras and other equipment according to Kimoto.\nView photos\nfukushima nuclar power station 2016 More It is however, important to note that the radiation is well contained within the plant, and is not affecting regions nearby. There have been reports of no new leaks from the facility or radiation leaking into the air or sea. Since TEPCO's attempt is the first to get so close to the melted fuel it is likely to reflect even higher radiation readings.\nYou may be interested in:\nRadiation levels at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant disaster site reach record high The Faces of Chernobyl: A documentary on the nuclear disaster Radiation from 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan reaches the US Fukushima radiation levels are so high that even a robot could not survive it", "external_links": ["http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/new-zealand-400-whales-wash-dead-3rd-largest-mass-beaching-countrys-history-1605819?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-inner&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/radiation-2011-fukushima-disaster-japan-reaches-us-1595870?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-related&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5P.nlIhaossDK.vIfkIwhQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjQw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/international_business_times_news_7/b18956098b9ba6a6e396c5cf45998a4d", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XepbIIpEKg2C3Z_qOwhwFg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjQwO2g9NDA2/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/international_business_times_news_7/9df48cd85615f8b34a794d505c0a7b09", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/faces-chernobyl-documentary-nuclear-disaster-1556839?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-related&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/XepbIIpEKg2C3Z_qOwhwFg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjQwO2g9NDA2/http://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/homerun/international_business_times_news_7/9df48cd85615f8b34a794d505c0a7b09);", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/fukushima-radiation-levels-are-so-high-that-even-robot-could-not-survive-it-1605987?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-related&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/new-zealand-400-whales-wash-dead-3rd-largest-mass-beaching-countrys-history-1605819?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=rss-inner&amp;utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news&quot;", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/surrogacy-where-does-uk-stand-should-law-be-reformed-1605297?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-inner&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/black-mirror-coming-true-tiny-drones-replace-bees-pollinators-japan-1605701?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=rss-inner&amp;utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news&quot;", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/black-mirror-coming-true-tiny-drones-replace-bees-pollinators-japan-1605701?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-inner&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/radiation-levels-japans-fukushima-nuclear-plant-disaster-site-reach-record-high-1604692?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-related&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/surrogacy-where-does-uk-stand-should-law-be-reformed-1605297?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=rss-inner&amp;utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news&quot;"], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T20:14:00.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
