Well, Collective Bias, an Arkansas social media firm purchased by Inmar last year , took it to the next level when the company proposed the idea of breaking the Guinness World Records title for the largest triangle ensemble. Earlier this week, the companies shattered the existing record of 574 musicians when 876 Inmar and Collective Bias employees played the triangle to \"I Heard it Through The Grapevine\" by Marvin Gaye . 876 Inmar and Collective Bias employees recently performed ‘I Heard it Through The… more Inmar TBJ spoke Friday morning with David Mounts , CEO of Inmar, a retailer technology services company, to discuss why the company decided to break the record with Collective Bias, which will retain its offices in New York and Arkansas as well as its 150-person work force. Why does Inmar have this tradition of having acquired firms visit the town hall and perform a skit? It’s really important that an acquired company integrate into Inmar. When they do that at the town hall, not only do they come to the meeting to introduce themselves, but they are actually for that entire week in an orientation of what call One Inmar week. This One Inmar week means that they learn all about our company, our culture, how we work. Everybody is assigned an Inmar buddy for a period of time. The day they show up, their buddy goes out to meet them. How did the idea for the triangle ensemble come up? When Collective Bias came in, they had to think about \"OK, what are we going to do?\" and they came up with this idea: \"Let's break a Guinness Book of World records. Let's pick an event that shows our unity,\" and they came up with the idea of the triangle ensemble. They said \"this is what we want to do\" and of course we empowered them. We've never thought about breaking a Guinness Book of World Records. It was very easy to say yes to. The reason that they picked the triangle ensemble was first of all, the triangle is really a symbol of unity. Even architecturally, a triangle can withstand a lot of force from the outside. It's also easy to play. You don't need to know how to read music. Pretty much anybody can play a triangle. How difficult is it to comply with the Guinness rules? There are seven pages of rules. They literally monitored that every single person was playing the entire five minutes to Marvin Gaye 's \"I Heard it Through The Grapevine.\" At the same time, they kind of have fun with it. They do an official count, they pull all the records together and told us the final number. The only record was 574 musicians that continuously played for five minutes, and we went to 876. How was the project received by Inmar employees? It didn't really surprise them at all that we were going to do something. Everyone was immediately happy to join in and participate. How does Collective Bias help Inmar? Social media has become so important in reaching consumers, putting businesses in a position where they can have content out on social media across a large number of influencers. Now Inmar and Collective Bias together can do that and track all the way through to see if sales are actually happening from it.
