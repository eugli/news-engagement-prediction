About 3 percent report a depressive episode in the past year. \nPregnancy and childbirth may put men at an increased risk of depression, they add, though research typically focuses on women, who are at an increased risk of depression during pregnancy and after childbirth. \nStill, past research also links depressed fathers to emotional and behavioral problems among children, the researchers write. \nREAD MORE: U of C study shows positive support around breastfeeding reduces post-partum depression \nFor the new study, the team analyzed data collected from the partners of women who took part in the Growing Up in New Zealand study and were due to deliver between April 2009 and March 2010. \nThe researchers conducted in-home interviews with 3,826 fathers during their female partners’ pregnancies. Another round of interviews were conducted with 3,549 of the fathers about nine months after their children’s birth. \nUnderwood and her colleagues found that 2.3 per cent of fathers had elevated symptoms of depression while their female partners were pregnant. During the postnatal period, 4.3 per cent of fathers had elevated depression symptoms after childbirth. \nThe men’s depression symptoms during pregnancy were tied to their being stressed or in poor health. After childbirth, symptoms were more likely in men who felt stressed during the pregnancy, or were no longer in a relationship with the child’s mother, men who rated their health as only fair or poor, those who were unemployed or had a history of depression. \nThe researchers can’t say whether symptoms of depression cause poor health and other issues, or vice versa, Underwood told Reuters Health. \n“It definitely points to the fact that we need to be giving couples more support,” she said. \nDepression should raise flags about those other health concerns, said James Paulson, a licensed clinical psychologist and associate professor at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia. \nPeople should also think of depression’s influence on the entire family, said Paulson, who wasn’t involved with the new study. \nREAD MORE: New mom’s honest post about motherhood strikes a chord with parents \n“There are a lot of treatments for this,” he told Reuters Health. “We’ve been dealing with depression for a long time. While we don’t have tailored treatments for paternal depression, we do have interventions for depression and those are effective.” \nThose interventions include medications and psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which can teach people how to address issues in their life that cause or worsen depression. \n“We know that either parent’s mental well-being impacts on the other, the relationship and family,” Underwood said. \nSometimes people may feel guilty seeking treatments when they just had a baby come into their lives, Paulson said. \n“Consider seeking treatment for yourself as a way to treat the system that includes your child,” he said. © 2017 Thomson Reuters ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T01:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:06:23.361+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
