Sick pay rules - what are they? People are entitled to be paid if they’re off work for four days or more, and earn more than £112 a week.\nHowever, evidence from Citizens Advice found that some employers are exploiting confusion around the rules to avoid coughing up.\nOne of the most common tactics implemented saw firms cancelling people’s shifts after they'd called in sick, to appear as though they weren't meant to be working in the first place.\nIn most cases, people who have their hours changed for example due to sickness, will often still be eligible - but don’t realise that they are.\nRead More Employment rights National UK living wage to rise in April Understanding zero-hour contracts What to tell your boss you're ill What to do if you're made redundant Can I take the day off because of snow?

Employees are legally entitled to statutory sick pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks - this is currently £88.45 per week .\nSSP doesn't start until the fourth day that you're off sick, so you might not get paid anything for the first three days.\nSome workers receive what’s called contractual sick pay on top of SSP, so they’ll receive full pay - or something similar - for a certain number of weeks. SSP is paid by your employer in the same way that you normally get paid.\nA typical sick pay scheme usually starts after a minimum period of service, for example, a three month probationary period you can find details of this in your contract.\nWho is entitled to sick pay? (Photo: Getty) You don’t have to be a full time employee to get statutory sick pay (SSP). You can also get it if you’re on a fixed term contract, work part-time, work through an agency or on a zero-hours contract.\nYou qualify if:\nYou normally earn more than £112 a week.\nYou’re sick for more than four days in a row, including non-working days. You’ll get sick pay from the fourth working day of your illness, unless you've been off sick in the last eight weeks - then you’ll get paid from the first working day.\nYou follow your employer’s’ rules about reporting sickness absence. Most employers ask you to provide a sick note if you’re off sick for more than seven days for example. If there aren't any rules, make sure you call in sick as soon as you need to take time off work, and ask if there’s anything else you need to do to record your sickness.\nDo I need to show proof of sickness? Your employer may set out how you should tell them that you are sick, ringing in before a certain time of the day, for example.\nUsually you will be able to self-certify for a week of illness; beyond that a medical note may be required.\nRead More Do you have to tell your boss you're ill? My employer insists I'm not entitled (Photo: Getty) If your boss insists that you aren't entitled to sick pay - but you feel you are, ask them to fill in the government sick pay form explaining their reasons.\nOnce you’ve got it, contact HM revenue and customs (HMRC). They will ask you about your circumstances and make a decision about whether you are owed sick pay or not.\nIf HMRC decide that you are owed sick pay, your employer will be ordered to pay up. If they still refuse, contact the ACAS early conciliation service who will negotiate with your employer.\nTime off to care for a sick dependant (Photo: Getty) You can take time off to care for a sick dependant. However, your employer does not have to pay you for this time unless your contract says they must.\nWhat happens after four weeks? (Photo: Getty) After four weeks, you’ll be considered \"long-term sick\". Your boss may be able to make you redundant, but only after trying to help you get back into work.\nIf you’re still sick after 28 weeks, your employer should give you a form to claim Employment and Support Allowance instead.\n Money Newsletter Follow @MirrorMoney Subscribe to our Money HMRC Citizens Advice Bureau Public services Employment rights", "external_links": ["https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/423808/ssp1-may-2015.pdf", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4028", "https://www.gov.uk/employers-sick-pay/overview", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorMoney", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrormoneysaving"], "published": "2017-02-27T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:29:24.483+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
