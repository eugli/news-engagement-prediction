'This fits in really well round my daughter, and it is a really well-paid job - the money is good for what you have to do. Emily says her job doesn't faze her at all as she is 'really comfortable with nudity' The mum says her job pays well and fits around her daughter, and she describes it as a 'really positive experience' Emily, who is currently on maternity leave, found her lucrative new career after a friend told her about women who are paid to film themselves cleaning their own homes in the nude. Google led her to company Naturist Cleaners, which employs almost 80 male and female staff across the UK, and she has been doing the job for five weeks so far. Clients are charged £65 for the first hour and £55 for the second hour to carry out duties including hoovering, sweeping, mopping, cleaning kitchen surfaces and bathrooms and ironing. Cleaners are paid £45 an hour and their clients must enter into a strict contract which forbids them from making any sexual advances towards them.. Due to their bare skin cleaners cannot do heavy duty cleaning or use strong chemicals and the only accessories they wear are rubber gloves and optional slippers. Emily added: 'Before my first job I was a little bit nervous but it was completely ok. 'The clients are naturists so for them it is completely normal to be naked, and that makes you feel normal and comfortable. 'So far it has been a really positive experience. There hasn't been anything which has made me think twice. 'The clients are really respectful and chivalrous. They carry the hoover up the stairs for me and offer glasses of water. 'The most common question people ask is 'is it warm enough?' but after a few minutes carrying a hoover around you definitely are. 'My friends and sisters know and are really supportive. My husband was initially a little concerned for my safety but he trusts me - I am an adult. 'I had a baby nine months ago and I'm sure there are people who would think 'oh my god' at my body. 'But I'm not there to be a sex object - so it doesn't matter if I have a few stretch marks on my hips or a baby belly. 'Everyone has a naked body under their clothes, I'm not sure why we're all so uptight about it.' Emily has no qualms about doing the hoovering at clients' houses completely naked Emily can dust, polish, and do the ironing while at work, but heavy duty cleaning is out due to her unique 'uniform' 'They don't care if you are young and gorgeous or 65 and wrinkly, it's about being comfortable nude. 'There is only stigma attached because someone attaches a stigma. If the client is happy and confident you feel like it is a normal thing and there is nothing to be concerned or nervous about. 'I arrive clothed because as much as the client and I don't have a problem with it, that's not to say the neighbours don't mind, and get undressed indoors. 'Then we have a bit of chit chat, I do my jobs and then go. I have never felt uncomfortable but if I ever felt there was anything untoward I would be able to leave.' The cleaning firm's company director Laura Smith said it offers services to both male and female clients and employs both male and female cleaners. The 32-year-old said since the company first hit the headlines earlier this month they have had hundreds of applicants. Laura, from London, ran a domestic cleaning company before an unexpected inquiry from a local naturist gave her the idea to set up the business - and she now also enjoys attending nudist events. She said: 'I had never been a nudist myself but I had always been quite an open-minded person and I like to try new things. 'One day a local naturist asked me to clean his house fully-clothed and was happy to pay extra to make me feel comfortable. 'I went, and he was the best client I have ever had. He was very friendly and professional, I never felt unsafe or uncomfortable. 'Now for the business to have taken off so well is a dream come true really.. No one else is doing this and it has been quite life-changing really. 'The majority of clients are male practising naturists from the nudist community. They pay for this service so they can get someone who has the same views and the same beliefs. A lot of naturists keep this part of themselves from their families and friends, so it is nice to find someone who understands. 'Our cleaners are from all walks of life and we are completely open in terms of age and body type, although we don't like to take on people who are very young. 'Our cleaners must never be open to offers or advances. Our terms which the clients must agree to state clearly that we do not offer anything else, and never to ask this of our cleaners. 'Especially these days, when there is a full market of naughty adult services out there, we want to send out the right message. We want people to understand this is not sexual - we do not do anything else than just professional cleaning. There has to be mutual respect.'
