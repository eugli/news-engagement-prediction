Those are the kind of empires we like. February 23, 2017 By Charles Bililies There was a fair amount of Greek tradition in my household growing up—we were raised in the Greek Orthodox church and did it up for holidays like Easter. But on the flip side, my parents also wanted us to be normal American kids, so I have a unique and sometimes complicated relationship with my cultural heritage, which I think Souvla reflects. Having spent most of my career in fine dining restaurants, I had the idea for Souvla in 2010, and after writing a business plan, I took off for a much-needed vacation and research trip to Greece in 2011. A month later, I came back and went full-bore raising money and finding a location to launch this fine-casual Greek concept (ed. note: There are now three, with more to come in other cities). Souvla is quite clearly Greek—it’s named for the rod that you roast a piece of meat on—but here’s how I’m making the concept easy to digest for the rest of the world.

We saw an opportunity to move away from the \"mystery cone meat\" associated with gyros and take a different, more natural approach. Photo by Alex Lau A menu that’s not all Greek to you: Ninety-nine percent of our clientele is not Greek, so when you look at the menu, it’s refreshingly simple and approachable. There are few decisions to make, and you don't need to be nervous about how to pronounce anything correctly. That Mediterranean aesthetic, minus the kitsch: It was important that we moved away from the stereotypical Greek places you see with the blue and white and the Mykonos windmills. We’re bringing the look you see on the less-traveled Greek islands, mixing tile, textured plaster, wood, weathered copper, and unique artifacts sourced both from travels to Greece and my grandfather's restaurants in Boston. Photo by Alex Lau The country’s only all-Greek beverage list: All the way down to the sparkling water! We've got Greek soft drinks made by Loux and an iced tea from Tuvunu that’s brewed using a leaf called Sideritis, which is harvested from the mountains of Greece. We also have Souvla Greek Beer brewed for us in the Peloponnese by Zeos that comes in a cool blue bottle. ...And about that wine: We have a line of Souvla Greek wines made in partnership with iconic Greek producers Domaine Skouras and Alexakis Winery. On the menu, it's just \"Greek White,\"\"Greek Rosé,\" or “Greek Red.\" We wanted people to be comfortable ordering it, not caught up with how to pronounce everything.
