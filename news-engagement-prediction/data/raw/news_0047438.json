I met with the doctors and just went through sequences to check all the different vitals, and then we were released,” said Busch. “Just a little bit of an upgrade. You can tell they’ve made an effort and it’s nice to have that security.” \nJohnson was the next driver to test out the same protocol after crashing out of the Clash, failing to finish the exhibition race for the sixth consecutive year. \nBut Johnson wasn’t clear on whether or not he actually went through the concussion process. \n“Maybe I did the protocol in there, I’m not really sure,” Johnson said. “They just evaluated me. It just seemed like a normal routine, so I don’t think I was in question to really go into the protocol. I will find out, I guess, at some point.” \nAs for Larson, his issue stemmed from a technicality. \nFollowing a minor crash, Larson and the No. 42 Chip Ganassi Racing team was forced to exit the race with 14 laps remaining after receiving a penalty for too many men over the wall during repair efforts on pit road. \nNASCAR’s new damaged vehicle policy states that if a pit-road penalty is issued during the five-minute period teams are now given to make repairs on pit road, they are forced to retire from the race. \nLarson was frustrated because he was under the impression the rule wouldn’t go into effect until after the Clash. \n“I think once everyone gets used to it, it’ll probably be fine,” said Larson in the garage. “It was a little confusing. We didn’t think all the rules applied in this race because in the drivers’ meeting, the way the made it sound like to the rest of us, none of these crash damage rules would apply until the 500. \n“I guess that’s why we had too many men over the wall because we didn’t know it was a rule.” \nJudging by reactions from the three drivers, NASCAR’s latest rules changes will take some getting used to and will definitely play a major factor throughout the 2017 season.
