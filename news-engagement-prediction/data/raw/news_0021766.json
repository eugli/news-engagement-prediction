Algabre and Mylen P. Manto   Jonathan Marfe sits in isolation at the Carcar City Police Station after his arrest as prime suspect in the alleged rape of a four-month-old baby. Kristine Joyce W. Campaña \nCEBU, Philippines - Police arrested a 40-year-old man yesterday in line with the alleged rape of a four-month-old baby in Carcar City. \nCarcar City Police Station chief Jose Liddawa said there were six persons of interest in the investigation, including the baby's father and brother, but a witness, as well as circumstantial evidence, pointed to suspect Jonathan Marfe a.k.a. Jojo, a native of Katigbian, Bohol. \nThe witness said he was drinking with Marfe and two others prior to the incident last Wednesday night. By midnight, they parted ways and he reportedly saw Marfe heading to the house of the baby. \nIt was around 1 a.m. on Thursday when a neighbor found the baby crying under a coconut tree. At the hospital, a doctor confirmed bleeding in the baby's private parts. \nThe baby's mother would tell the police she was unaware that her baby had been taken. \nLiddawa said the clothes recovered from Marfe's house were the same clothes the witness said Marfe wore last.   \n\"Yun gyud ang sanina nga gigamit niya unya na-recover namo sa iyang balay. Nangutana mi ni Marfe kung anong suot niya, lain ang tubag niya, hindi nagtugma sa sinabi ng witness,\" Liddawa said. \nPolice also recovered a carton with traces of blood, which is believed to have been the same carton used as a mat. \nInvestigation showed Marfe was drunk at the time of the incident. \nYesterday, Marfe told reporters he did not do anything to the child. He admitted having a few drinks Wednesday night but he reportedly was not drunk. He also denied using illegal drugs. \nLiddawa said they are looking into reports Marfe is facing cases of attempted rape in Bohol. Marfe arrived in Carcar three days before the incident. \nPolice Officer 3 Vivian Tamayo of the Women and Children Protection Desk said the infant is being cared for at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City. \nMarfe is facing rape charges.
