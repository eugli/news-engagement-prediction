'Overlooking Wellington barracks.' Mr Fox said: 'There are about ten or 15 people in here at the moment, we're all ANAL activists, we moved in last night at about 12am. 'We've got the air conditioning working and all the utilities and we have every intention to pay for the bills. 'We can see the barracks and we can see the guards doing their marches, this morning I was awoken to the sound of them playing Jurassic Park at about 10am. Squatters occupying a mansion on one of London's most expensive streets have opened up a second home overlooking Buckingham Palace 'It's about as close to Buckingham Palace as you could ever be. 'There's no furniture or anything here, it's bare but we have an office kitchen with a miniature oven and a microwave. 'We are planning on inviting more people and some of the people who were staying in the other place wanted to move in. 'We have some recovering drug addicts in the other place and it's deteriorating too, we chose to move out in anticipation of an eviction, we don't want to give the police more work than we have to. 'At this new place we want to use it as a community space and have group workshops on things like squatting and fare dodging. Around 15 'activists' moved into a Â£14.2million mansion in the early hours of this morning 'But we'll also use it for things like yoga classes and workshops that aren't based around ANAL.' The mansion had been earmarked for demolition and developers at Buckingham Gate Investments wanted to turn it and the building next door into 14 luxury apartments. Parts of the multi-million pound house, which has elements dating back to the 18th century, was partly destroyed during the Second World War and was rebuilt during the 1950s to match its former Edwardian design. Moments after moving into the plush mansion squatter, Mr Fox posted a photo of the front door with a Staffordshire Bull Terrier hanging out a sash window. He added: 'It's in great condition, it's really nice the majority of our view is the tourists looking around. 'We can see the front and side of Buckingham Palace but you can't see through the windows. 'When you climb onto the roof you can see London Eye and lots of towers, it's pretty alright.'
