How cool is this to find wild chickens living in Singapore among us!” \nThey were not *just* chickens. While they might look like chickens, it didn’t take an expert to know that they are not the kind of bird that one would find on the dinner table. Too pretty to eat. \nI never realized that they are called Red Junglefowl until they all disappeared this past week. Also learnt that a BBC documentary had been made about them. My family was particularly excited in 2015 when we discovered a hen nesting at the bottom of our block near the carpark. My wife named the bird Broody. \nFor 3 weeks, we would check on Broody every day when came home. Broody laid 6 eggs. We were totally elated like new parents when the eggs started to hatch. 5 hatched. The last one did not. We were really sad for Broody, but Broody seemed to take it in her stride. \nNevertheless, Broody did the mother thing and led her 5 chicks around the block. It was a really adorable sight. Alas, in the second week or so, Broody lost one to a predator, leaving her with 4. We mourned with Broody. \nThe 4 chicks eventually grew up and we never saw Broody and her brood again. I reckoned they had joined the rest of the flock in the vacant field next to our block and also in front of the Flame Tree Park condo. \nIt was a pleasant surprise for us that our kids could get to witness the miracle of life and be able to get so close to these gentle creatures. The birds don’t run when we got close. I guess they (and their ancestors) have lived in the area for so long that they understood that the good people who lived in the area would do them no harm. \nThen last year, during the funeral procession of the late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, I was there lining the streets with my family to pay our last respects -- and the birds too were out there in full force. It was as if they understood. :’( \nI remember this distinctly because I remember telling my wife, “Wow, the chickens have come to pay their respects too!” My kids then started chasing the chickens around after the gun carriage drove past. Ah well. \n... Sin Ming to my family is a really special place. It is a place in Singapore where man and nature could live together in harmony -- and we have done so for so many years. Advertisement \nEarlier this evening, my wife and I drove around the estate hoping to find one that might perhaps have escaped. There were none. They are all gone now. All. Gone. \nI would have to admit that, unlike what some folks might say, i.e. that the red junglefowl do not crow, that’s not true. The roosters were really loud. I could hear them from the 14th floor. \nWell, I hope that those of you who complained are proud of what you have done. Our estate is now DEAD, like every other estate in Singapore. No more will we hear from our feathered friends. \nNo more will we be able to see these beautiful creatures hatch their young and lead them puttering around in the estate. \nMy wife has taken many photos of our feathered friends who were once our neighbours over the years and we would like to share them with our fellow Singaporean here. Many might not have had the privilege of meeting these beautiful creatures. \nRest in peace our dear feathered friends. My family and I will miss you. :’(", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:42:23.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
