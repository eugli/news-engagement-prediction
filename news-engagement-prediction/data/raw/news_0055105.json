ABC News reports that Energy Transfer Partners — the Texas-based company tasked with building the pipeline, which the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe opposes on the grounds that it bisects sacred lands an d threatens water supply — said in a court filing that the project could be completed \"anywhere between the week of March 6, 2017, and April 1, 2017.\" The Oceti Sakowin camp in North Dakota.

Although a historic victory was handed down to protesters from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in December, President Donald Trump wasted no time in taking executive action to reverse the decision after his Jan. 20 inauguration. Since then, the Cheyenne River Sioux have joined the Standing Rock Sioux and taken legal action as a last-ditch effort to obstruct the pipeline's completion, filing a motion \"to halt construction and drilling\" at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Feb. 9.

A separate motion filed by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe seeking a preliminary injunction is still pending, and will be heard in a Washington, D.C court on Feb. 27.
