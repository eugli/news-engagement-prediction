Appearing before the Home Affairs Committee, Ms Rudd said the order did not equate to a \"Muslim ban\", but she added that Islamic State (IS) would \"use any opportunity they can to make difficulties, to create the environment they want to radicalise people, to bring them over to their side. So it is a propaganda opportunity for them, potentially.\"\nShe said: \"I think the important thing is for this government to state that we disagree with the ban and we have said that it is divisive, it is wrong. I will continue to say that.\"\nDemonstrations against Mr Trump took place in cities around the UK on Monday and Ms Rudd said she had told US Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly of the \"difficulties and the response that was taking place in London and across the country\".\nAmber Rudd said she had raised concerns with the Trump administration Asked about Ms Rudd's comments, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"We have been very clear that we believe this policy is divisive and wrong.\"\nIt was \"clear\" that IS would \"twist any policy from any government for their own propaganda purposes\", they added.\nPrime Minister Theresa May, who met Mr Trump last week, has invited the president for a state visit - the highest honour accorded to foreign leaders - with no date yet announced for it.\nBut support for a petition calling for Mr Trump's visit to be downgraded from a state visit, which usually includes a ceremonial welcome and a state banquet, soared after the president announced his travel ban on Friday.\nThe Commons debate on this, on 20 February, will also take in the second petition, saying \"the leader of a free world\" should not be \"gagged\".\nAnalysis George Osborne was keen to use Xi Jinping's state visit to bolster UK-China economic ties By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent\nA state visit is the ultimate weapon of British diplomacy, the bunker buster of soft power that can break down the hardest of tyrannical hearts.\nFew world leaders can resist the siren lure of all that royal bling: horse-drawn coaches, state banquets, processions down the Mall, the sheer scale of all that gold leaf and pomp and flummery that allows them a brief window into a royal fantasy that many countries envy but can rarely match.\nThis weapon is deployed sparingly, normally no more than twice a year. But it does get used.\nState visits are not merely ceremonial affairs, they are political and purposeful. They are used by the British government of the day to further what they see as Britain's national interests.\nRead James's blog in full\nEarlier on Tuesday, Lord Ricketts, permanent secretary at the Foreign Office from 2006 to 2010, said it was unprecedented for a US president to be invited for a state visit in their first year in the White House.\nIn a letter to the Times he added: \"It would have been far wiser to wait to see what sort of president he would turn out to be before advising the Queen to invite him.

The anti-state visit petition is the second most supported since the online system was set up, behind one calling for a second referendum on EU membership, which received the backing of 4,150,260 people.\nThe Commons held a separate emergency debate on Monday on Mr Trump's immigration policy.\nA year ago MPs debated a 574,000 signature petition calling for Mr Trump - who was then fighting to become Republican presidential candidate - to be banned from the UK.\nView comments", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-politics-38794587", "https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/vj/live/idt-images/data_pic-uspresidentsvisits/obama_queen_2011_getty_dkq86.jpg);", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38808647", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/video_and_audio/headlines/38806924", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/BFE9/production/_93892194_gettyimages-493455880.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/14B53/production/_93891848_mediaitem93891847.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/C0BB/production/_93893394_de27-1.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-01T01:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:07:16.014+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
