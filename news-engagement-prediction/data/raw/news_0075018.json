Port Everglades had nine cruise ships docked in port at the same time on Sunday, Feb. 26, 2017, up from its typical eight-ship busy day. (LenKaufman.com /Port Everglades) Arlene Satchell had more than a full house on Sunday with nine cruise ships and a fast-ferry to the Bahamas calling at the seaport, an official said Monday.\nIf all the ships were lined up end to end, they would equal the height of the One World Trade Center five times, port spokeswoman Ellen Kennedy said. \nIt’s too early to say whether the nine visiting ships contributed to another single-day cruise passenger record for the port, Kennedy said. “It takes us a few days to calculate the [ship] manifests.” \nEven though a final tally is pending, the seaport estimates more than 50,000 cruise passengers traveled in and out of the port Sunday. \nPort Everglades’ last single-day passenger record was set on March 13, 2016 with 55,885 cruise guests traveling through the port. Another single-day passenger record was reached on Dec. 20, 2015 with 53,485 passengers, port data show. \nIn recent years, a typical full house at the Broward County seaport usually meant eight cruise ships docked at the same time. \nBut this time around, Port Everglades was able to squeeze another cruise ship in — the smaller 210-passenger Pearl Mist — now sailing to Cuba. \nPearl Mist was accommodated at Terminal 1 after Balearia Caribbean’s fast-catamaran Jaume I departed that morning for Freeport, Bahamas, port spokeswoman Ellen Kennedy said in an email. \nThe eight other cruise ships docked Sunday were Costa Deliziosa, Freedom of the Seas, Carnival Conquest, Regal Princess, Allure of the Seas, Coral Princess, Nieuw Amsterdam and Celebrity Silhouette. \nCaption January home sales by the numbers \nThe National Assn. of Realtors said home sales rose 3.3% in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.69 million.
