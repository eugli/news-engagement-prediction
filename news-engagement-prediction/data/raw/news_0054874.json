But that estimate proved conservative, as the city’s cumulative surplus reached HK$65.4 billion by the end of December, with reserves totalling HK$908.3 billion. \nMajor accounting firms and analysts had estimated a 2016/17 surplus of between HK$70 billion and HK$85 billion, largely because of higher-than-expected land sale income and stamp duty revenues. \nChan earlier said he would ensure the best use of public money to “benefit all people”. \nThe budget address – to be delivered in the Legislative Council chamber – should indicate if Chan plans to adopt Tsang’s tight approach to fiscal management, or if he will follow the more ambitious spending model put forth by Tsang’s major rival in the leadership race, and a candidate widely considered Beijing’s favourite, Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor. \nFollow the latest updates on the speech, which will start at 11am, below: \n10.46 – Chan arrives \nPaul Chan Mo-po enters the Legco chamber, on an unusually quiet morning, to make the final preparations for his maiden budget speech. \n10.20 – FTU protests pre-speech \nAbout 40 members, including several district councillors, from the Federation of Trade Unions urge Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po to give out sweeteners his in maiden budget. \nTheir proposals include a tax allowance to help parents with education fees, especially in poorer families. Hong Kong children enjoy free primary and secondary education, but have to pay in kindergarten. \nThe federation’s former legislator Tang Ka-piu also criticises the government for underestimating its surplus in recent years. \n“The government should share its wealth with the people appropriately since it is going to have a huge surplus again this year,” Tang says.
