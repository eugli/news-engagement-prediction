While the picture is too darn cute to be missed, Anushka’s post alongside is even cuter. The ‘Wedding Pullav’ actress wrote, “It's safe to say i wouldn't hop onto a plane to be with anybody else for just 4 hours, but I'd walk to you if i had no other way.

To a thousand more years of fudgi and all the weird stuff we loved doing as children. Love you long time.\" Awww!
