I wasn’t sure what was happening.

I screamed but then there was a lot of laughter afterwards. \n“It’s so typical of him. I can’t even leave him alone for a second. He has done some peculiar things before. \n“He tried to go into a tantrum because we wouldn’t let him finish his haircut. We took the razor off him but he wanted it back so he started to get upset.
