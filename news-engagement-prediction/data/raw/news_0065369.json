The documentary became a cult hit and the basis for a Broadway musical and HBO film. \nWith the back of the house literally flapping in the breeze, journalist Sally Quinn couldn't resist Grey Gardens. Her husband, Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee, could. Terribly allergic to cats, his allergies blew up as soon as he walked in, Quinn told NBC News. \n\"You are out of your bleeping mind. There is no way we are gonna buy this house,\" Quinn recalls Bradlee telling her. Grey Gardens in 2017. The Corcoran Group \nBut she did. And after a year of renovations, Grey Gardens had been restored to its magnificent charm. It is a big house, but Quinn insists it is by no means a mansion. She describes it as a cozy, shingled house. \nIt is true to its 1930's heyday: comfortable rooms, lots of windows, no marble, gold or media room in sight. Outside, there is a swimming pool, a tennis court, a thatched cottage where Bradlee wrote and Quinn nursed their son. And of course, there are the gardens, often covered by fog from the ocean, that give the home its name. \nQuinn bought the home for $220,000 in 1979. It is now on the market for $20 million.
