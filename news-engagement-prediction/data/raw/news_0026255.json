'If you're not taking bogans, where are you going to find good admin people?' Aly said, prompting shocked audience to gasp. The presenter, who won the Golden Logie award in 2016, has since distanced himself from the remark, saying he intended to make the opposite point, but got his words mixed up. There was an outpouring of rage on social media following the comments, and while some set out to prove Aly wrong, others accused him of being on a 'high horse' That has done little to lessen the outrage his comment generated, however, with social media users bashing him on Monday night. Emma Kate wrote: 'Rude, Waleed @theprojecttv. I've two degrees, including one in Latin and Ancient Greek & all I'm looking for is an admin position. #nobogan.' Dom posted: 'Ummm did Waleed just say that? I work in admin and I am the antithesis of a Bogan. Get off your high horse.' Donna Taylor wrote: 'No Waleed. Not cool at all. Not all Admin peeps are Bogans. Many are degree qualified. Can't believe your comment!' And Joaby Boaby said: 'I never watch your show these days but I've turned in lately... Have just been called a bogan by Waleed.'
