As a vice president visiting Europe facing similar populist upheaval, he sought in his first trip abroad to convey a different message: The established order the U.S. has led since World War II remains intact, and the U.S. will not retreat from its role on the global stage.\nStory Continued Below\nGone were the rhetorical flourishes about a dramatic American course correction. Pence was there to preach consistency, not upheaval.\nIn comments on both NATO and the European Union, Pence reassured wary world leaders that the United States stands by the international rules it helped write, and that its alliances abroad are as important as ever.\nInfused in Pence’s remarks was a dedication to the values that he said bind the U.S. with its allies — a dedication to freedom and democracy that are often lost in Trump’s broadsides against nations “taking advantage” of the U.S. and his oft-repeated declaration of “America first.” \n“Weakness arouses evil,” Pence would often say on the campaign trail. That sentiment guides his worldview, says an administration source who was not authorized to speak on the record.\n\nPence: Trump White House supports 'free and independent press' By Matthew Nussbaum \n“He’s always believed that if America is weak it allows other nations to fill the vacuum,” the source said. “He believes America has to have a strong role around the globe to advance the principles of freedom.”\nAmerica's role in the world, in other words, is not so much to maximize its own interest as to defend its values abroad — a vision not exactly in sync with Trump's but more in line with that of the George W. Bush Republican Party.\nAnother administration source summed up Pence’s view of America’s role in the world in just three words: “Leading not following,\" an implicit shot at what some called the Obama administration's “lead from behind” approach.\nWhile Trump may approach international affairs with a deal-driven viewpoint, Pence appears to bring the same values-driven approach that has long meant a U.S. foreign policy based not just on national interest but on international law and human rights. That dichotomy left some in Europe with the same question that keeps Republican leaders on the Hill up at night — is what Pence and other high-ranking administration officials say today going to be torpedoed by an off-the-cuff Trump remark or early-morning tweet tomorrow?\nPence’s message could hardly have been more clear.\n“The United States of America strongly supports NATO and will be unwavering in our commitment to this transatlantic alliance,” Pence told the Munich Security Council crowd on Saturday. “We have been faithful for generations — and as you keep faith with us, under President Trump we will always keep faith with you.”\n“The United States’ commitment to the European Union is steadfast and enduring,” he told the European Council in Brussels on Monday. “We are separated by an ocean, but we are joined by a common heritage, and by a common commitment to freedom, democracy and to the rule of law, and we are confident that bond will endure and grow in the years ahead.”\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos disinvited from CPAC slot amid tape controversy By Matthew Nussbaum and Alex Isenstadt \nAnd yet Trump has railed against NATO, calling the organization “obsolete” and he has celebrated the United Kingdom’s vote to leave the European Union, comparing it to his own election. One of his top advisers, Steve Bannon, sees in Europe’s nationalist movements kindred spirits to the insurgent campaign he helped lead in Trump’s victory. \nStill, there was much to hearten European leaders in Pence’s visit — from his pledge to hold Russia “accountable” to his declaration that the U.S. will “confront threats to Europe’s security and stability” — just as similar notes were struck during recent visits by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense James Mattis. The message seemed to be that a seismic political earthquake at home would not rattle long-held American commitments abroad.\nWorld leaders may be further heartened by Trump’s announcement Monday that Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, a widely respected military leader, would take over as national security adviser after the ouster of Michael Flynn, whose coziness with the Russian regime of Vladimir Putin unnerved many and ultimately proved to be his downfall.\nBut soothsaying from Pence, Mattis and Tillerson, who fit the mold of America’s past political leaders in substance and tone, can only go so far when Trump remains at the helm.\nEven as Pence was singing from the same foreign policy hymnal that has guided the U.S. since the Second World War, Trump was making claims about an attack in Sweden that did not happen and firing off tweets about the problems of “large scale immigration” in the peaceful Nordic country. \nPence may be the preferred messenger for leaders abroad, just as he is for Republican leadership on the Hill, but in the end it is still Trump setting the agenda.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T12:52:44.219+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
