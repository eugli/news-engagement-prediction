He acknowledged that his own presidency from 2001 to 2009 also began after a contentious election but that it was “hard to compare times”. This press conference is proof Donald Trump will never be presidential Read more \nHe said that Trump was still in the early stage of his presidency and that Americans have “got to take the man at his word”. \nAsked whether he supported Trump’s travel ban on people from seven majority-Muslim countries, Bush said: “I am for an immigration policy that is welcoming and that upholds the law.” \nBush, whose presidency was shaped by the 11 September 2001 al-Qaida attacks on America, also called for religious tolerance. “One of our great strengths is for people to be able to worship the way they want to or not worship at all,” he said. \nAfter the attacks, Bush made a point of supporting Muslims and praising Islam’s teachings as peaceful. \nRegarding the press, Trump has branded some news outlets as “the enemy of the people”. Bush said: “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy, that we need an independent media to hold people like me to account. \n“It’s important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power.” \nBush also said he did not know if a special prosecutor was needed to investigate contacts between Trump associates and Russia but added: “We all need answers.” \nHe also said that during his presidency he tried to persuade the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to accept the concept of an independent news media. \n“It’s kind of hard to tell others to have an independent, free press and we’re not willing to have one ourselves,” Bush said.
