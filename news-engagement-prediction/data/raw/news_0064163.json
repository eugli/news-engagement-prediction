Request everyone to draw the cash they actually require. Overdrawal by some deprives others,” he tweeted. \nDas brushed aside claims of cash shortage and said in another tweet: “Enough cash available. Logistics issues of reloading ATMs more frequently being addressed.” \nLast week, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the Reserve Bank was monitoring the cash supply on a daily basis.

The demonetisation drive sucked out 86% of the currency in circulation, leading to a severe cash crunch. \nFollowing the note ban, the government and the RBI had placed several restrictions on withdrawing money from banks and ATMs, which have been gradually relaxed. \nCurrently, one-time withdrawal of Rs 50,000 is allowed from savings accounts, and from March 1 all restrictions on withdrawals will be removed, the RBI has announced.

But I don’t think that there is any shortage of cash,” said a banking department official who did not wish to be named. She added that banks have adequate supply of cash to deal with demand. \nEarlier on Wednesday, Das had clarified that the government has no plans to introduce Rs 1,000 notes and the focus is on increasing production of lower denomination currencies. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T05:15:27.257+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
