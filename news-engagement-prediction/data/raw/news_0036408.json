(Supplied: Queensland Symphony Orchestra.) \nDe la Parra holds the distinction of being the first Mexican woman to conduct in New York City, and is an official cultural ambassador of Mexico. \nShe hopes being a female conductor in what is a highly competitive field will one day no longer be an issue. \n\"I always had very good ears and was very good at organising people and my father was the one who told me why don't you conduct — you should become a conductor,\" she said. \n\"I was 13 and when he explained why it clicked and I thought that's not a bad idea. \n\"I think things have changed already in my personal journey — it's been such a difficult process but not because I am a woman necessarily, mostly because it's just such a hard profession anyway. \nDe la Parra has led more than 70 orchestras around the globe, but it is Brisbane she is now proud to call home for the next year. \n\"Everything's really easy here,\" she said. \n\"Where we come from, Mexico City, which is a great city, but it's so humongous and and there's so much traffic. This is such a contrast. \n\"Have you heard the orchestra? It's such a good group, such an amazing level of talent. \n\"It was love at first sight with the orchestra and with the town. \n\"Of course it's really far away but that's the only downside.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T12:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T08:11:37.512+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
