Marley was rushed to a doctor, who told the Adelaide family that her windpipe could have collapsed if she had been stuck for just 45 seconds longer. And if another child had gone down the slide right after Marley, it may have resulted in a broken neck. Marley has been plagued with nightmares every night since the accident, and has become 'very angry'. 'She's not an angry child,' Gail said. 'She also believes she's ugly now because of her neck. Gail Oster had bought Marley's hat just the day before the horrific accident, which has left a line of rope burn cutting across her daughter's throat Gail said Marley (pictured together) was rushed to a doctor, who told the Adelaide family that her windpipe could have collapsed if she had been stuck for just 45 seconds longer 'Obviously I tell her she's beautiful and that it will go away, but she's six years old. There's her mind processing what happened.' A five-year-old Toowoomba girl is currently sporting a nearly identical mark on her neck after the cord of her own hat became stuck in a climbing net at school. Her hat did not have a safety release, but Gail is arguing that the plastic clip is not enough to keep children safe. She has called for a nationwide ban of the drawstrings and revealed that another mother in Tasmania reached out to her because her daughter was injured the same day as Marley while wearing the same hat. The terrifying incident could have been fatal if Marley's friend Madison didn't come to the rescue and release the clip (seen left on Marley's hat) from the slide (pictured right). Gail also pointed out that the safety clip failed despite the fact it was a brand new hat. 'I bought it on Wednesday, I had it on her head on Thursday,' she said. 'Even now if you try to unclip the hat it's very hard, it doesn't unclip.' 'It's not an isolated incident,' she added. 'A lot of parents have said these hats have done this kind of damage.' She wants them banned completely. 'No cord, no clips,' Gail said. 'It's a hazard.' Gail said the incident has changed her once happy child (pictured before the accident) angry, and has left Marley plagued with nightmares every time she goes to sleep The Department for Education and Child Development in South Australia recently banned all hats that have cords or toggles on them from the school yard. Gail is hoping she can spread the ban across Australia before it's too late. 'Thankfully, the parents that have been affected with these hats, we've been able to take our kids home,' she said. 'But one day that won't happen.' 'This is dangerous. There will be a child that dies, there will be a family that gets that phone call.'
