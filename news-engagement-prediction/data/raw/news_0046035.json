As many as five buses were seen in the stop area at the same time. \nAt least three taxis stopped illegally within the area during that period, forcing bus drivers to wait behind the cabs before driving into the stop. \nCommuter Ular Go, who takes the bus outside Jardine House regularly, said that in the past, she had noticed buses letting passengers off before getting to the bus stop, as well as taxis parking in the stop area. \n“It is a big problem,” she said. “The buses have to let us off [before the stop], and we have to walk over from there.” \nBus passenger Emily Halsall, who commutes daily between Central and Wan Chai, said congestion in the area was “pretty bad”. \n“It’s what happens when there’s a big long line of buses in this small space,” she said, noting that it could take as long as five minutes for buses to pull out of the stop due to congestion. \nDrivers letting people alight early were just trying to accommodate passengers, she added. \nBus drivers were also complying with offloading rules outside Sogo in Causeway Bay, although at least five taxis drove into the bus stop in a half hour period after 10am, with a few stopping to drop off passengers in front of buses. \nA Guardforce van also unloaded boxes in the stop area during this time. \nStella Ng, a passenger waiting for her bus outside Sogo, said congestion was a problem, but she did not think fines were the right answer. \nBuses and taxis alike need to stop near the side of the road for passenger convenience, she said. \n“This is just the way things are in Hong Kong, since our city is in a very small space,” she said. This is just the way things are in Hong Kong, since our city is in a very small space. Stella Ng, bus passenger \nFederation of Bus Industry Trade Unions chairman Lam Kam-piu said that the action on Monday morning was called by a new union of Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) drivers. \n“We won’t negate actions initiated by our colleagues ... because we have been negotiating with the Transport Department for a long time as well.” \nLam said the federation had urged officials to create more restricted zones so that other vehicles would not block the bus stops, but the plans were shelved in face of opposition from district representatives. \n“I know that traffic has been congested between Central and the Western Harbour Crossing, and it has also been more jammed than usual at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel (between Hung Hom and Causeway Bay),” Lam told the Post . \nHe said the bus companies would be meeting the Transport Department on Monday to discuss the problem, but the unions were not invited. \nLam said the federation represented thousands of bus drivers from KMB, New World First Bus and Citybus, while the new union consisted of 100 to 200 KMB drivers. \nKMB union chairman Kwok Wah-li said he did not know how long the union’s action would continue for, but added that many drivers had taken up the call to patiently queue up at bus stops before letting passengers disembark. \nIn an interview with RTHK, he said police actions to fine drivers were “irresponsible” since the infractions were the result of cars illegally parked at bus stops. \nPictures of the union action have circulated on social media, including one of a bus with a sign next to the driver that read: “You can yell at me, hit me or complain about me for today’s actions, but do not ask me why we have to queue up.” \nThe Wan Chai District Council’s planning and transport committee asked police to step up law enforcement efforts for illegal parking last Tuesday, according to a Facebook post by Yolanda Ng Yuen-ting, a member of the council. \nIn her post, she said bus drivers should not drop off passengers outside bus stops, but denied criticism that her words had led police to target drivers. \n“Police, the Transport Department and bus companies should work together to discussion solutions,” she wrote. \nNg has not yet returned a call from the Post asking for further comment. \nThe collective action was sparked off by a video showing a KMB driver being ticketed outside Jardine House early on Sunday. \n“Bus stops being occupied by illegal parked taxis, minibuses, cars and other vehicles present serious problems,” Kwok Wai-kwong, vice-president of one of the KWB staff unions, said. “We have told the Transport Department about this. They took no action and instead turned against us.” \nBut police said congestion-related traffic offences, including unauthorised unloading in bus zones, had caused “deteriorating” road conditions in the city. \nThe number of such violations rose by 20 per cent in the first 11 months of last year, and problems “remained unchecked” despite officers stepping up enforcement, according to a Legislative Council brief detailing a proposed 50 per cent increase in penalties for these offences.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T11:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T07:17:35.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
