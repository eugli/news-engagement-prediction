Will Samsung retire the ‘Note’ series? Image: INQUIRER.net stock photo \nEvan “Evleaks” Blass has done it again. As Samsung tries to keep the lid tight on its upcoming flagship smartphone, a mostly complete spec sheet has been leaked by the prominent phone leaker. Image: Twitter/@evleaks \nEngadget reports that while the leaked spec sheet is still very much in rumor territory, Blass has had a good track record so far. That said, it’s interesting to see that the Galaxy S8+ will be getting a very large 6.2-inch Quad HD+ Super AMOLED display. That is just 0.1mm shy of Lenovo’s 6.3-inch monster-of-a-phone, the Phab2. It’s even larger than the retired Galaxy Note 7. \nUnlike the Phab2, the supposed Galaxy S8+ might actually be a lot smaller, thanks to Samsung’s super slim bezel design. After all, previous reports stated that Samsung is not quite done with the Note line and a phablet-sized flagship phone would essentially render any Note device in the future redundant. ADVERTISEMENT \nThe rest of the items listed on the spec sheet are hardly attention grabbers. An iris scanner, LTE connectivity, 4GB RAM, 64GB internal storage, and a 12-megapixel rear camera are all fairly standard for high-end devices. \nSince Samsung won’t be launching the Galaxy S8 at the Mobile World Congress next week, we’ll just have to wait and see what innovations and gimmicks they will come up with to differentiate their device from the crop of flagship phones fresh from the congress.
