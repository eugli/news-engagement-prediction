The latest figures reveal that almost two in three Australians are overweight or obese and a staggering 75 per cent are consuming more sugar than ever recorded. One hundred experts from 53 organisations working with state and federal bureaucrats have drawn up a 47-point plan to address the burgeoning problem.

That includes taxing junk food, especially sugary drinks, to make them more expensive and reducing advertising and marketing of those products to children. 'Often good policies exist, but they are not being implemented in a coordinated way,' Dr Gary Sacks, the leader of the study and a Senior Research Fellow at the Global Obesity Centre at Deakin University, said in a statement on Monday. Junk food could also be banned from schools and sports venues, but reducing children's exposure to junk food was also important, Dr Sacks said.
