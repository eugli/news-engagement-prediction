The game finishes once you arrange the dolls in their correct spots. \nIn addition to crafting apps, the Japanese woman also maintains a blog – in Japanese and English – where she shares clips from her travels and also teaches people how to use Excel to make art. \nYou can toy around with Hinadan by downloading it from the App Store from this link . And in case you’re eager to find out more about Wakamiya, you can watch her TEDx talk about the process of active ageing in the digital landscape.
