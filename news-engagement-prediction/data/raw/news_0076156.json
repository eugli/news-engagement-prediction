But we are duty-bound to put the Club’s long-term interests above all sense of personal sentiment, no matter how strong that might be,” Leicester City Vice Chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha said in a statement announcing the club’s decision. \nThe club’s triumph under Ranieri’s watch, a feat the club described at its greatest moment, is considered one of the greatest in football with talks of a movie about the club’s season prominent afterwards. \nUnfortunately, the fairy tale could not continue with the club just above the relegation zone in the Premier League and with “one feet” out of the Champions League after falling to a 2-1 defeat to Sevilla. \nCiting reason for wielding the axe on the Italian, Leicester said, “Domestic results in the current campaign have placed the Club’s Premier League status under threat and the Board reluctantly feels that a change of leadership, while admittedly painful, is necessary in the Club’s greatest interest.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T23:30:46.327+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
