Despite evidence of increasing frailty, he still plans to stand for re-election next year. He's seen to be being held in place by his wife Grace and a faction of his Zanu-PF party loyal to her. \nRetorted one Zimbabwean: \"You think Grace would do that for us?\" \nThere was even a tongue-in-cheek suggestion that Mugabe should rival Obama and go bungee-jumping: after all, Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe's top tourist resort, offers that activity. \nCommented @ali_naka: \"Africa's 'greatest' leader cannot be upstaged by Obama - villagers recommend bungee jumping for his 93rd birthday.\" \nMugabe turns 93 on February 21. Supporters are planning a $2.5m party. \nSee some of the tweets below Someone needs to tell Mugabe that life after Presidency isn't so bad... https://t.co/Z6GrilsYD5 — M. S.
