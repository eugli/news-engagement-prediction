Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nShe's long traded on her physical attributes to succeed in TV, so it's perhaps not surprising that Caroline Flack is keen to rage against the ageing process. \nThe former X Factor host, 37, has confessed that she's so eager to battle gravity that she sleeps in a bra every night to avoid sagging breasts. \n\"Up until about 14 I only had one boob. For about one year - from 13 to 14 - I had just one little boob,\" she told the Daily Star . \"I would go into my mum's room and steal her Wonderbra and put it on to feel like I had boobs. I slept in a Wonderbra until I was about 20. \n\"Now, I always sleep in a bra - every night - and my boobs have never gone down because there's always something cupping them up, but I haven't had babies or anything yet!\". Caroline Flack says she has slept in a bra since puberty (Photo: PA) Pictured with former X Factor co-host Olly Murs (Photo: Thames / Syco Entertainment) \nSadly, there's no sign of her starting a family any time soon as she recently split from handsome boyfriend Blue Logan after just three months together. \nThe television presenter had been dating the British artist for three months, but it has been reported the pair have decided to part ways in a mutual decision which will see them remain close friends. \nThe break-up comes after the Strictly Come Dancing winner was left heartbroken at the end of 2014 when her boyfriend Jack Street, who she had dated for 18 months, allegedly cheated on her with 'Glee' actress Dianna Agron. \nFortunately, she has work to keep her busy after landing a starring role in a musical. \nThe Strictly Come Dancing champ will join a touring production of Gerswhin musical Crazy For You, where she'll play the lead role of Irene, opposite fellow Strictly winner Tom Chambers, who won the competition in 2008. \nThe Watermill Theatre Company production kicks off on 17 August in Plymouth, and will run until 9 December around the country.
