But things could be a lot worse for the Red Devils if it wasn't for Zlatan Ibrahimovic's 14 league goals but they could lose the Swede next season. \nJose Mourinho has partially blamed some dodgy refereeing decisions for United's current issues but they've also had a few big decisions go their way too. The truth is that Mourinho's side have failed to see off Stoke twice, Burnley, Hull, West Ham and Arsenal in games that they dominated. \nWith Wayne Rooney struggling for goals, Anthony Martial struggling for form in general and Marcus Rashford not getting much game time up front the Red Devils have become too reliant on Ibrahimovic this season. \nIbra's deal comes to an end when the season finishes but there is an option to extend the deal for a year. However super agent Mino Raiola has revealed that the former Juventus striker could return to Italy to join his fourth club in Serie A. Speaking to Radio CRC Raiola said: \n\"As for Ibrahimovic, he's always been in love with Naples and the passion of the Neapolitans and I've always said that openly because he grew up in a family which was to the Neapolitans and then with me. \n\"He knows what the love of the Neapolitans means and that passion has always attracted him. I know that [Napoli president Aurelio] De Laurentiis knows him, and with Zlatan you never know what could happen. \" \nWatch Zlatan's interview with Thierry Henry is interrupted by Paul Pogba: \nSuper agent Raiola, whose only equal is Jorge Mendes when it comes to making lots of money representing players, is from Naples and there's a chance he'd love Zlatan to pop up at the Stadio San Paolo to help Napoli try to win the league. \nUnited are reportedly on the verge of signing Antoine Griezmann for next season, a move of around 100 million euros, has been mooted, but would need another striker if they lost Ibrahimovic. \nAfter becoming PSG's top scorer of all time many questioned if Zlatan would be able to do it in the Premier League but the former Inter Milan striker has proved the doubters wrong. \nWill Zlatan move to Italy or stay with United?
