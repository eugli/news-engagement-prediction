No cause for optimism in divided Turkey Die Welt says Mr Yucel, 43, is the first journalist with German nationality to be held in pre-trial detention since Mr Erdogan's AKP party took power in 2002.\nSeveral other journalists have also been detained in connection with the emails, purportedly obtained by left-wing hackers from the private account of Berat Albayrak, who is the country's energy minister.\nThere have been demonstrations in Germany calling for Mr Yucel to be freed Pre-trial detention in Turkey can last up to five years, Die Welt says.\nMany Turkish writers and journalists have been arrested in a widespread crackdown that followed a failed July coup against Mr Erdogan.\nMore than 100,000 people have also been sacked or suspended from Turkey's police, military, civil service and private sector since the failed coup and tens of thousands arrested.\nThe Turkish government says the measures are necessary given the security threats it faces but critics say Mr Erdogan is using the purges to stifle dissent.", "external_links": ["http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/98CD/production/_94871193_mediaitem94871192.jpg", "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/0845/production/_94871120_mediaitem94871119.jpg", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/F2A5/production/_94871126_mediaitem94871125.jpg", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-38389981", "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37883006", "https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article162438369/Welt-Reporter-Deniz-Yuecel-muss-in-Untersuchungshaft.html"], "published": "2017-02-28T02:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:38:59.626+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
