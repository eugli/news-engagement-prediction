The gunman peppered the victim's pickup with bullets. (Facebook) \nAs the ramp ended, the man heard two shots. He tried to get away on LBJ, but the Yukon passed him on the driver's side, pulled in front of his pickup and then slowed down on his passenger side. That's when the gunman fired twice more. \nThe victim could feel the bullets tear into his pickup but was unharmed. He pulled over and called 911 as the shooter exited LBJ onto Central Expressway. \nHe got out and found large-caliber bullets rolling around in the bed of his pickup, along with four bullet holes: three in the bed and once in the back of the cab. \n\"I could understand road rage, but never to the point of pulling out a gun,\" the driver said. \"That's a whole other level.\" \nHe didn't get a look at the licence plate and couldn't give a detailed description of the shooter, but suspects other drivers witnessed the shooting. \nSo far no arrests have been, but Dallas police are investigating. Anyone with information can contact police at 214-670-5840.
