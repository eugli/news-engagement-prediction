Driving the conflict, they say, is an administrative layer that lies between entrenched political appointees and entrenched civil servants. \n“We had to deal with political appointees trying to burrow themselves into the federal civil service -- these are the people who are hostile to the president’s agenda,” said Robert Moffit, a former assistant director of the office of Personnel Management in the Reagan administration and now a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation. “The bureaucracy is often resistant to change, so President Trump needs to make sure the agencies are properly staffed with career civil servants and political appointees to ensure his agenda can be properly and fully executed.” \nMerck CEO Kenneth Frazier listens at left as President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with pharmaceutical industry leaders in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 31, 2017. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)Expand / ContractOn Monday, the White House fired Obama holdover Sally Yates from her role as acting U.S. attorney general just hours after she directed Department of Justice attorneys not to defend President Trump’s executive order calling for a temporary ban on refugees and immigrants from seven designated countries. It should never have come to that, according to Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Andrew Napolitano, who said Yates had a duty to resign or defer to a subordinate if she could not carry out orders. TRUMP FIRES ACTING AG AFTER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT STAFF TOLD NOT TO DEFEND REFUGEE ORDER \n“Sally Yates is a highly regarded lawyer, but this was intolerable,” Napolitano said. “Instead of going out quietly with cake and candles, she thumbed her nose at the President of the United States, and he properly fired her.” \nIt was just the latest, high-profile example of hostility between bureaucratic agencies and the White House as President Trump embarked on the second week of his presidency. Last week, reports surfaced that Denver Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Kerry O’Grady posted a message on Facebook last year saying she would go to jail rather than “take a bullet” for Trump. Grady has since been placed on administrative leave. \nThe Interior Department was forced by the Trump administration to close its official Twitter accounts last week, reportedly in response to the National Park Service retweeting two unflattering posts about the size of the crowd at Trump’s inauguration.
