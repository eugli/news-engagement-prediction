A group of youngsters, which had taken part in the pro-jallikattu agitation recently, kick-started 'Clean and Green Vellore' campaign on Saturday and took up the task of clearing thorny bushes and restoring the century-old Otteri lake as their first task.\nFrom being one of the major and oldest water bodies in Vellore, the 100-odd acre lake had reduced to a grazing field for cattle for over a decade. The lake receives rainwater that flows from the surrounding hills. It is ultimately supplied as drinking water to Vellore residents from the filter bed, said an official. After a gap of 19 years, the lake received surplus water in December 2015 owing to heavy rain. However, it dried up fast. \"Now, it resem bles a small pond. It was not desilted and deepened for 70 years,\" claimed E Sathish Kumar of Change Vellore forum.\nTeaming up together, the strangers-turned-friends at the jallikattu protest decided to remain together to work for the betterment of society .They have resolved to remove invasive species in and around Otteri lake and plant native species on the bunds to revive the water body . Starting with a small group of around 50 volunteers from various walks of life, they cleared empty liquor bottles and removed 'Karuvelam' trees grown on the bunds.\"We will continue the campaign on holidays,\" said D Manikandan, a volunteer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T08:46:26.783+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
