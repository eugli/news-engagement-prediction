She writes about film and television, and edits the Weekend section. Molly was born and raised in Philadelphia, where she spent a lot of time sitting too close to the television screen. More by Molly Eichel Arrow icon \nArdmore native and Friends Central grad Benj Pasek took home the Academy Award for Best Song for “City of Stars” from La La Land . He, along with cowriter Josh Hurwitz (who also won for Best Score) and Justin Paul, were actually nominated twice in the category; the other nod went to “Audition.” \nPasek is having a pretty good year. His Broadway musical Dear Evan Hansen , cowritten with regular creative partner Paul, is about a troubled kid Pasek knew from Friends Central. It’s currently enjoying a successful, and critically acclaimed run on Broadway. Our own Toby Zinman called the show \"heartrending and gorgeous.\" \nThis is Pasek’s first Academy Award. \n\"I want to thank my momm who is my date tonight. She let me quit the JCC soccer league to be in a musical. This is dedicated to all the kids who sing in the rain and all the moms who let them,\" Pasek said while accepting the award. \nPasek's mom is Kathy Hirsh-Pasek , Stanley and Debra Lefkowitz Distinguished Faculty Fellow in the Department of Psychology. \nPenn grad John Legend bolstered Pasek’s words during the performance by performing both songs. Legend not only costarred in La La Land, he also produced it with Wynnewood's Mike Jackson and Ty Stiklorius , who he met at Penn. \n#Oscars : Watch @JohnLegend perform 'City of Stars' from 'La La Land.' pic.twitter.com/tcIksU16HC \n— Hollywood Reporter (@THR) February 27, 2017 More Coverage ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T11:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T06:42:54.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
