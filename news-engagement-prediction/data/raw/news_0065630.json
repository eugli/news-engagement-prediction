I am financially better now, thanks to the lds.org.sg community that I joined which take great pains to uplift members' standard of living and education, all without any publicity or advertisement and certainly no taxpayer dollar involved like how Joseph Schooling did it! \nI am penning this as I really feel for my working colleague who as a single mother living in a rental flat at Indus Road, has been writing to various VWOs for scholarship or a bursary to complete her daughter's degree but she said no one has bothered to even acknowledge her pleas, much less to render aid. She has written to \"Tzu Chi Foundation\", \"Buddhist Lodge\", \"Catholic Welfare\" and even \"Methodist Bursary Program\" but no one has gotten back to her. She then approached her MP for help but the MP said it is not the practice of the PAP to write to VWOs as it is considered private entity and they can choose whether they wish to help or not. The MP's letter for my colleague to MSF has already been rejected thrice due to the income ceiling problem, which I believe currently stands at $550? \nI think its noteworthy for the public to probe the motives of the setting up of these organizations that paint beautiful pictures of how 'much' they have done with recurring motherhood mission statements to solicit even more monies. I distinctively remembered the Methodist Bishop Robert Solomon despite being 'mistakenly' overpaid for 5 years but has yet to return the illicit gains. The rest like Kong Hee and 'Venerable' Ming Yi are public knowledge. \nA.S.S Contributor  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T04:04:26.291+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
