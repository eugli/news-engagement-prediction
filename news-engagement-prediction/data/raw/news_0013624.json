Coca-Cola’s “It's Beautiful” ad shows families and individuals from different backgrounds across the country. (Coca-Cola via YouTube) \n“The premise of ‘It’s Beautiful’ can be simply stated: America is Beautiful and Coca-Cola is for everyone. It celebrates Coca-Cola moments among all Americans and features snapshots of American families,” Coca-Cola said in a statement. \n“We believe it’s a powerful ad that promotes optimism, inclusion and celebrates humanity – values that are core to Coca-Cola. 'It’s Beautiful' shows just a few of the ways Americans enjoy our brand and how Coca-Cola brings families and friends together every day.” “America the Beautiful” is sung in English, Spanish, Keres, Tagalog, Hindi, Senegalese, French and Hebrew in the background. (Coca-Cola via YouTube) \nWhile the commercial may be three years old, the message rings even more important today.
