The club captain converted a spot-kick shortly before the break, prodded the ball in from close range following a penalty-box scramble and fired in a fine finish - all before the clock reached the hour mark. \nGladbach suddenly had an away-goal lead and their stunning turnaround was made safe in the 60th minute, as Andreas Christensen headed in a fourth to send the visiting fans into utter delirium. \n\nTOTTENHAM'S WEMBLEY WOES CONTINUE AS ALLI LOSES HIS COOL \nMauricio Pochettino's Tottenham had been one of the favourites to win the tournament since their exit from the Champions League, despite their 1-0 first-leg defeat to Gent. \nA turnaround at Wembley looked to be on the cards when Christian Eriksen levelled the tie after 10 minutes, but Spurs handed the initiative back to the Belgians before half-time. \nHarry Kane headed into his own net to give Gent a valuable away goal, before Dele Alli was given a straight red card for a shocking tackle on Brecht Dejaegere. \nVictor Wanyama gave Spurs hope with a blistering strike but Gent secured a 2-2 draw - and 3-2 aggregate win - thanks to Jeremy Perbet's 82nd-minute strike, which was, remarkably, their first and only shot on target. \n\nFEKIR INSPIRES RECORD-EQUALLING LYON ROUT \nLyon laid down a marker for the rest of the tournament with a 7-1 second-leg thrashing of AZ, in which Nabil Fekir hit a hat-trick. \nThe 23-year-old's treble, along with goals from Maxwel Cornet, Sergi Darder, Mouctar Diakhaby and Houssem Aouar - his first for the club - capped a devastating display from Lyon that left AZ with nothing but a Levi Garcia consolation to celebrate. \nLyon's 11-2 aggregate victory is the second-biggest in the tournament's history, while it matches the record for goals in a single tie set when Porto - led by Radamel Falcao - defeated Spartak Moscow 10-3 across two legs in 2010-11. \nZenit were one of the bigger casualties of the round, with their 3-1 win over Anderlecht on Thursday not enough to prevent them losing on away goals following a 3-3 draw. \nAthletic Bilbao were shocked by APOEL, losing 2-0 in the second leg and 4-3 overall, but Celta Vigo will represent LaLiga in Friday's draw after Iago Aspas' injury-time penalty and Cabral's extra-time header sealed a 2-1 aggregate win over Shakhtar Donetsk. \nElsewhere, Roma progressed despite a 1-0 loss to Villarreal, while Rostov, Besiktas, Ajax, Olympiacos, Copenhagen and Genk all advanced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T18:11:30.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
