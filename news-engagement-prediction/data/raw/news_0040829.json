His achhe din promise was like DDLJ. But after 2.5 years, it has become Sholay’s Gabbar,” Rahul said, apparently likening the iconic movie character’s looting spree to the government’s note recall move. \nThis was the first time the Gandhis have campaigned for the Congress in this election season and launched the party’s fight for assembly segments in their mother Sonia Gandhi’s Lok Sabha constituency of Rae Bareli.

Ask the people of Varanasi if Modi had done anything for them” she told a large crowd at another rally at Baburiha village of Bachhrawan assembly. \nShe also hit out at Modi over the hardships faced by women during the so-called demonetisation exercise over the past three months. \n“Whenever he (Modi) comes, he refers to relationships. I want to say this on behalf of crores of women: There is no need to establish any relations. You are a woman. I am also a woman. You were made to stand in queues. Are these not atrocities on women?” Priyanka said. Priyanka Gandhi Vadra greets her supporters at a rally in Rae Bareli on Friday, February 17, 2017. (HT Photo) \n“Modi should learn from former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. As PM you can do a lot for development.” She clapped her hands once to emphasise how the PM ordered the withdrawal of banknotes. \nThe 45-year-old had refrained from speaking at the first meeting at Rae Bareli – where the party candidate is the daughter of a former Congress member expelled for criminal charges -- but relented on popular demand during the second rally. \nRahul’s Bollywood-laced remarks came a day after the PM criticised the SP-Congress alliance. \nAt an election rally, the PM said the Congress’ earlier slogan was “27 saal UP behaal” that criticised the SP’s tenure. “But what happened, aa gale lag ja (you embraced)” said the PM. \nAt Rae Bareli, Rahul blamed the PM for widespread hardships of the poor and not keeping his promises but steered clear of mentioning the four seats in his Lok Sabha constituency of Amethi, where the SP is facing the Congress.

Ganga is my mother. A son promised to clean the Ganga, to provide drinking water to every house, ring road and a Bhojpuri film city. But a relationship is not made by words, one has to live a relationship,” said Rahul. \nRahul said the media was afraid of Modi and did not highlight his failures. “Take a camera to Varanasi and find about the promises the PM made in Varanasi. How many of these promises have been fulfilled?” Rahul asked. \n“Did the Ganga get clean, did he make the ring road or the Bhojpuri film city?” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T02:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:01.129+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
