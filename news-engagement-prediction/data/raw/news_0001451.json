Editor Advertisement \nThe deadline of 31 January for Sigma to fix their faulty lifts have come and gone. So far, the company have not been able to solve all the old issues, and in recent weeks, more new cases of lifts continued to break down have emerged. \nAmongst places affected are at Bukit Batok, Bishan, Sengkang and Macpherson. As the deadline had passed, both HDB and Sigma had remained silent on whether the issues had been resolved. So what now? If these happened in opposition wards, confirm opposition MPs would have been shot down by the media and Ministers alike, accusing them of incompetence. But these happened in PAP wards, so why no big issue made out of it? Aren't the Town Councils then partly to blame for the incompetence, just like what the opposition TCs would be too if it happened to them? \nLet's see how the media and our spotless Ministers handle this. \nDes Yap \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
