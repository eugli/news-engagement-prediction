You might remember that Reilly kept his hold on Miles Warren (the formal Jackal) by creating numerous clones of him and not telling him which one was the real version. When the others start to disintegrate, Warren is left the only one standing, and picks up his former villainous identity once more, complete with his trademark costume and mask. \nHe makes a big play right off the starting line and heads to Reilly's safe house, burning his cash and passports. The two go at it, destroying the house in the process. It isn't until Reilly gets in the Jackal's head that the battle turns, with Reilly saying \"I've learned all you could possibly teach me.\" He then crushes one of the core pillars, which topples the upper floor and roof onto Warren's body. As he walks away from the burning wreckage, Reilly says \"Life isn't fair. No matter how many times you live it. You taught me that...the hard way.\" \nIt appears The Jackal died as quickly as he returned. You can view some spoiler images from the issue in the gallery. \nThe Amazing Spider-Man is written by Dan Slott and Christos Gage with art by Giuseppe Camuncoli. Inking is Cam Smith with Jason Keith on board as colorist. Alex Ross, Gabiriel Dell'Otto and Joe Jusko are on covers. \nA CLONE CONSPIRACY TIE-IN! Spider-Man has been through hell… The Jackal has taken his best shot, but Spider-Man doesn’t need to face him alone. Discover who is joining Spider-Man in his battle! \nThe Amazing Spider-Man #24 is in comic shops today.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T22:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:35:42.868+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
