They generally don't have the same standards as what we do in Australia,\" he told ABC Radio Hobart. Photo: A banded stingaree rests on the sand near Binalong Bay. (Supplied: Danny Lee) \n\"The marine reserve at Bicheno — Governor's Island — is probably one of the best dive sites in the world from what' I've looked at. \n\"It is probably very underrated in relation to being a dive destination and I encourage anyone to go check it out. It's just amazing, absolutely incredible.\" \n\"Tropical is spectacular until you look down at Bicheno. Photo: Mr Lee rates Tasmania's weedy sea dragons among his favourite marine creatures. (Supplied: Danny Lee) \n\"With good lighting, some of the colours down there would rival the Great Barrier Reef — the sponges, the different types of corals.\" \nHe has been so impressed he has invested big money in gear and lighting to show off his underwater playground. \n\"I've always been a diver and grew up around the water. I wanted to show others the really cool things I see,\" he said. Photo: This clown nudibranch was found at Binalong Bay. (Supplied: Danny Lee) \n\"I borrowed a few cameras and gradually mastered lighting and what's involved in taking photos.\" \n\"Lighting is one of the biggest issues, as soon as you get 5-6 metres underwater you lose a lot of your colour,\" he said. \n\"Some fish don't notice [lighting] at all, and others - because fish don't have eyelids ... if it gets too bright it can send them off in a a hurry so I don't hit them too hard with a big flood light.\" Fighting off the creatures of the deep \nHis encounters have included getting up close and personal with a large octopus off Bicheno. External Link: Instagram video of octopus wrapping around a cameraman \n\"I was on my own at 15 feet, so no sort of running to the surface and I just remember looking at my camera to make sure everything was okay and then just seeing a big arm, tentacle wrap around my face, thick as my arm so it was a big one,\" he said. \n\"It came up behind ... and it just about blocked out the sun and it wrapped all of its arms around me, I did freak out a little bit. \n\"I'm not proud of the fact I gave it a good left hook to the body and it let me go after a few seconds. \n\"The local dive operator said it was notorious for tyring to get divers' cameras, it just wanted the shiny camera and not me.\" \nMr Lee was not deterred by the encounter and is now gunning for a close encounter with a killer whale. \n\"There are creatures I haven't yet photographed ... killer whales in particular they do come around Tasmania and I haven't seen them yet but I'm really hanging out for that,\" he said. \nLee's photos have thousands of followers on social media and now are being featured in a gallery in St Helens. \n\"Any sort of fish that gets out on it's own, I like creating negative space in the photos and I've had a lot of positive comments,\" he said. \n\"So I'm looking for something a bit artsy, even in a common species.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T08:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:41:06.267+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
