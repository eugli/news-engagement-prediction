Trump said Friday that sometime next week he will announce measures to increase national security. He did not say what they were.\n“We’ll be doing something very rapidly having to do with additional security for our country. You’ll be seeing that sometime next week,” Trump said at a joint press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.\nAdvertisement\nTrump’s comments came after an NBC News report that his administration is rewriting his controversial travel ban so it could pass legal muster.
