Bush in 2006 and confirmed by voice vote - a procedure the Senate uses when overwhelming support is apparent — signaling that Trump opted for a candidate who had the best choice of overcoming Democratic opposition.\nAs a federal judge, Gorsuch has expressed support for originalism — the idea that jurists should interpret the Constitution as its authors would have — and textualism — the idea in legal circles that laws should be interpreted literally.\nBoth concepts are popular among conservatives and were practiced by Scalia.\n\"Judges should strive … to apply the law as it is, focusing backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader at the time of the events in question would have understood the law to be,\" Gorsuch said during a 2016 speech at Case Western Reserve University.\nCuomo to propose amendment to protect Roe v. Wade in New York \nThe nominee also singled out Scalia for praise at his nomination ceremony Tuesday night, calling him a \"lion.\"\nWhile his tendencies have earned him wide respect within conservative legal circles, there is a very thin paper trail when it comes to Gorsuch's judicial rulings on key conservative issues like abortion and gun rights.\nIn fact, as a jurist, Gorsuch has never actually had the opportunity to weigh in on \" Roe v. Wade \" — the 1973 Supreme Court case that effectively legalized abortion — or any other high-profile abortion-related cases.\nHe has nevertheless earned plaudits in conservative circles for his rulings in support of religious freedom.\nSen. Schumer willing to block Trump's Supreme Court pick \nIn a 2013 ruling in the well-known Hobby Lobby case, he sided with the privately owned chain, whose owners' Christian religion figured heavily in its business practices.\nPresident Trump has tapped a candidate who is most likely to overcome Democratic opposition.  (Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) Gorsuch ruled that Obamacare requirements that businesses provide insurance coverage for employees' contraception violated the rights of employers who objected to contraceptives on the basis of their own religious values.\nThe ruling was upheld as part of the Supreme Court decision in the case.\nGorsuch has also earned praise for his extensive judicial experience and strong academic qualifications.\nSenate Dems delay confirmation votes on Mnuchin, Price, Sessions \nHe graduated from Columbia University in 1988 and received his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1991.\nHe clerked for the U.S Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit Judge David Sentelle from 1991 to 1992 and for U.S. Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy in 1993 and 1994.\nGorsuch also worked in the private sector for several years, rising to partner at the Washington, D.C. firm of Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel, before taking a job as principal deputy to the associate attorney general at the Justice Department from 2005 to 2006. Gorsuch also earned a Ph.D., in law from Oxford University in 2004.\nIn addition, he would appear to be somewhat well-acquainted with the inner workings of Washington. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, led the Environmental Protection Agency under former President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1983.\nChristie: Trump’s immigration order hurt from ‘terrible’ planning \nTrump's pick of Gorsuch, however, comes at a charged time, as he fights a pitched battle with Democrats to confirm his own cabinet, and amidst continuing fallout from his orders on immigration.\nTrump moved up his announcement of the Supreme Court pick from Thursday to Tuesday, a decision many viewed as looking to change the topic from the refugee ban.\nDemocrats are also still seething that Senate Republicans refused to consider former President Obama's Supreme Court pick for the entirety of last year after Scalia's death.\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he's willing to block Republicans from confirming Trump's Supreme Court nominee.\nIt's not yet clear whether Senate Republicans — if they can't win the 60 votes needed to confirm Gorsuch — would back the \"nuclear option\" and end the filibuster for Supreme Court picks.\nTags: donald trump supreme court donald trump first 100 days neil gorsuch  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T03:27:34.946+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
