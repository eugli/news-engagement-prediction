Manly How Warringah Rats rugby players made Chilean orphans smile Jon Geddes, Manly Daily February 24, 2017 5:05pm Greg Clark’s 20 years at Fox Sports Rats recruit stars in sevens victory\nTHEY are the heartfelt words from a young boy in a Chilean orphanage that will remain with members of the Warringah Rats rugby club forever.\n“You made us feel happy because we are alone,” the youngster told the squad of 31 knockabouts from the northern beaches who had just spent a day painting the bedrooms and landscaping the gardens at the Maria Ayuda Franz Reinisch home in the city of Chilean.\nThe message was as uplifting as it was unexpected for the Warringah players during their recent South American odyssey that combined community work with rugby.\nNo one was more moved by that experience than the youngest player on tour, 17-year-old Remy Lowe, a year 12 student at the NBSC Freshwater Senior Campus.\nmedia_camera Warringah Rats hard at work in the orphanage garden. Picture: Erin Morton.\n“Oh my gosh, I wanted to cry, that was tear jerking,” she said of the young boy’s emotional ‘thank you’ to the Rats.\n“I wanted to experience what other people have to go through and I definitely went on this trip for that aspect of it.\n“I think everyone needs to see the hardship other people face because otherwise you are a bit too ignorant to it.”\nThis venture followed similar trips by Warringah to Kenya, Fiji, Cuba, Alice Springs, Sri Lanka and Vanuatu where the players set out to make a difference doing charity work as well as acting as “rugby missionaries”.\nThe orphanage tucked away in the suburbs of Chilean took the Warringah players right out of their comfort zone on the affluent peninsula.\n“The older boys who are here actually come from the police station because they are taken away from their families due to specific situations like abuse, sexual abuse, violence and points like that,” Maria Antonieta Mora Rivan, the home’s social director, said through an interpreter.\n“When they are here we try to make a normal life for them, so they go to school, they go to the doctor and the people who work here try to make them feel like a family.”\nmedia_camera Rats players show their skills with a paint bush.\nShe said while the home receives money from the government to keep going, it was not enough.\n“What the Rats are doing will be very useful. The kids have little crises and they feel rage and they break things so all the time we are buying things,” she said.\nMora Rivan became quite emotional the more she discussed the special visitors from Sydney.\n“My first impression of the team is that they are very sensitive people and they feel very connected with the boys,” she said.\n“Even though they can’t talk with each other they still communicate and that is an inspiration. The boys feel very comfortable and are very happy because the Warringah team is here and sharing with the children.”\nThe day before their working bee three “tradies” in the squad- Hamish Finch, Tim Poynting and Adam Bate- visited the orphanage to suss out what needed to be done. They then went to the Chilean equivalent of Bunnings where they purchased all the supplies needed.\nBesides doing the work, which included creating a vegetable garden, the Rats interacted with the youngsters and soon formed strong bonds with them. They played football, practised muay Thai and one boy carrying a nasty scar on his arm impressed the players by doing two-finger push-ups. Meanwhile Lowe and teammate Crystal Maguire joined in an impromptu Zumba dance class.\n“I’m really bad at dancing and I wanted to learn to dance like a Latina. I’m slowly but surely getting there,” Lowe said\nmedia_camera A yoiung Chilean rugby player shows his skills at one of the Warringah coaching clinics in La Granja. Picture: Erin Morton.\n“I still feel good thinking about it today, especially throwing around the ball and talking to the kids.”\nTour skipper and Warringah first grade star Dave Feltscheer described the day as an amazing and fulfilling experience.\n“We were pretty much given free rein to make the place better and make their lives a little bit brighter,’’ he said.\n“Everyone should be really proud of the outcome.\n“It is really hard to put the feeling into words … but it is quite emotional because of the feeling it gives us, but more importantly the changes we make to people’s lives.\n“We take things for granted and you don’t know how good you have got it until you see how the other 99 per cent live. Rugby breaks down barriers, whether it is language or social class.”\nJust before they were scheduled to leave the orphanage a few Rats noticed that the children’s modest swimming pool had sprung a leak and was falling apart. So three squad members ordered a taxi, went to the Chilean Bunnings and bought a replacement which they assembled in the backyard — an act which left the orphanage staff speechless.\nmedia_camera Rats Rachel Brennan and Remy Lowe with a young fan,. Picture: Erin Morton.\nThe team also conducted coaching for local players, one in La Granja which is one of the poorest areas in Santiago surrounded by slums with major social and drug problems. The young players enthusiastically jumped into the drills set up by the Rats and swarmed over them at end like they were rock stars.\n“Rugby is all about partnership, it is all about family. And we feel like that with them, ” said local player said Misael Guzman.\nThat helps explain why Australia’s new ambassador to Chile Robert Ferguson, said the Rats were now ambassadors for Australia.\n“These guys are very much part of our efforts to build links between communities because any bilateral relationship with Chile, or any other country really, relies on that grassroots community level engagement,’’ said Mr Ferguson, who was a special guest at the Rats’ tour game in Santiago when they beat leading local side Santo Tomas 71-6.\n“So, like it or not, these guys are diplomats for Australia. They are our sports diplomats and I think they have been doing a fantastic job.”\n“It is important for the development of the sport but also raises our profile among people in certain less-advantaged areas,’’ Ferguson said.", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fsport%2Fnews-story%2Febcf7b27a8d65182e0b8a35be3b615d4", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/component/resource/networksales/exoduscampaigns/campaigns.json?t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_template=s3/networksales-loader/index&td_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&td_pagetype=articlepage_v2&esi=true&td_channel=desktop&td_section=newslocal/manly-daily/sport", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/chronicle/ap/latest/assets/img/news-plus.svg", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/996cfcdeb3e2e145248886607639656d?width=650", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/67e14306ab7f4d4c92a82611fb3563b4?width=316", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/d4561122063cc8ce533e4851f419fe61?width=650", "http://www.homeimprovementpages.com.au/find_local_tradies", "https://s2.wp.com/_static/??-eJytjcEKAjEMRH/IblgU1z2I31K6wbY0aW1Sl/17C64XD56EgQzDmwysxQR2qS0oELseDeu2nyHKAX4BhsK9WsWBAn9gl1mRFdQj9cozFGBcxeVabDOEWjMoUkm9J+AylcydF/BoF6ywBNHd/+WtZZs2DU6MoK3Ovwe+033qRtfxNM3jfJzOl/gC4F5rlQ==", "https://s2.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/newscorpau-metro/templates/components/header/dist/header.css?m=1484889074h", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/1187160efb57f2d6060f02d9dd7f9011?width=650", "http://pixel.tcog.cp1.news.com.au/track/spp-api/v1/template?path=components.header.header&exclude-css=false&exclude-js=false&t_product=DailyTelegraph&t_domain=dailytelegraph.com.au&device-channel=desktop&is_front_page=0&show_idaas_login_placeholder=1&v2=1&is_local_news_section=1", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/0d16f11aadf4f9d2198b64d83b5756be?width=1024", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=135086289853833&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fsport%2Fnews-story%2Febcf7b27a8d65182e0b8a35be3b615d4&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fsport%2Fnews-story%2Febcf7b27a8d65182e0b8a35be3b615d4", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Rugby%20Rats%20made%20orphans%20smile&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailytelegraph.com.au%2Fnewslocal%2Fmanly-daily%2Fsport%2Fnews-story%2Febcf7b27a8d65182e0b8a35be3b615d4", "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/networksales/loader/latest/assets/js/exodus_loader-client.js"], "published": "2017-02-23T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T00:30:11.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
