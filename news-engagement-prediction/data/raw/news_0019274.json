He also did not realise Mr and Mrs Coutts were in any distress, he said. \nMr Harbour said only some of the text messages have been made public - and they don't tell the full story. \nHe explained that made it \"difficult to enforce\" the terms and conditions, but that he \"didn't notice\" that was the case.

That is how it has affected us – and it's affected our whole family. \n\"We don't deserve this. It feels like we've murdered somebody.\" \nMr Harbour added: \"We've got no idea what we're going to do now. We've got a little bit of savings, but there is even a hate group on Facebook about us.
