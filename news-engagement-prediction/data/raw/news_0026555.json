I'm covered in beer - I feel disgusting,\" Khan wrote. \n\n\"We weren't doing anything, we didn't actually even initially realize she was talking to us,\" she said. \n\n\"Once she threw in the line of Muslim b-words that's when we realized she was yelling at us,\" she said. \n\n\"At this point, I decided to start filming her.\" \n\nThe 27-year-old woman who carried out the attack is shown in the recording ordering Khan and her friends to get back. \n\nA police spokesman said they were \"aware\" of the video and a formal complaint had been laid. \n\n\"Police are assessing the information,\" the spokesman said \n\nIslamic Women's Council's spokeswoman Anjum Rahman said she was appalled, but not entirely surprised, by the abuse. \n\n\"A small number of New Zealanders behaved in that way. She would like to meet with the woman filmed swearing and hurling abuse to help change her attitude towards Muslims,\" Rahman said. \n\nHowever, Khan has received an outpouring of support after posting the video. \n\n\"Thanks everyone for your comments and support - this is so overwhelming. I'm still with the police - will try and respond once I'm done,\" Khan tweeted. \n\n\"My phone is over run with positive messages right now. So good to know that we as Kiwis don't accept this as our NZ,\" she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T09:57:19.577+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
