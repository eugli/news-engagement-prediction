SEE ALSO: Sony 4K TVs will be controllable with Google Assistant later this year \nThe series is meant for high-performance DSLRs or mirrorless cameras and offers up to 299MB/s write speeds. According to Sony, a new algorithm developed by the company, along with the fast write speeds, will result in faster burst shots and quicker image saving. Sony's file rescue software works with the cards to quickly recover accidentally deleted images and video files. \nThe cards also claim fast read speeds of up to 300MB/s and are waterproof, x-ray proof, shock proof and temperature resistant. \nâ€œAs the continuous shooting of higher-resolution images and adoption of 4K video with DSLR and mirrorless camera increases, the inherent need for larger, faster and more reliable cards becomes apparent,\" Romain Rousseau, Sony's European product marketing manager, said in a statement about the launch. \nThe new cards will be available in March 2017.
