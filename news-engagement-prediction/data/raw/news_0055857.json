On Tuesday, Ross Dorrian, 55, was sentenced in the Masterton District Court after pleading guilty to charges of using a restricted trap and ill-treatment of an animal. \nREAD MORE: \nHe had set the leg-hold trap within 150 metres of houses. \nThe incident, in March last year, horrified animal lovers and animal rights activists. \n\"Because the trap was suspended from a fence post, Eli was left hanging by her left front leg, unable to pull herself up. Numerous scratches and scuffmarks on the fence confirm her desperate efforts to escape,\" Wellington SPCA chief executive Steve Glassey said in a statement on Wednesday. \n\"Let's be very clear here: this trap was set incorrectly. It is not acceptable for a trap to be set in such a way that would leave any trapped animal hanging, regardless of whether it is the target animal or not. \n\"Doing so could result in cruelty offences being committed, as in this case.\" \nDorrian also failed to check the trap within 12 hours, meaning Eli went undiscovered on the day she was caught. Ad Feedback \nA vet found the cat's left elbow was dislocated and she would have suffered intense pain. \nDorrian set the trap without permission from his neighbours. He conceded that setting a possum trap in an urban area carried a definite risk of catching a cat and expressed remorse. He was ordered to pay a $1500 fine to the SPCA, $500 emotional harm to the owners, $263 vet costs and $100 in legal fees. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:32:15.262+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
