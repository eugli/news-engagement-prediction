Study uncovers how cells organize the growth of their structural filaments October 19, 2016 \nTo take shape, to move and to reproduce, cells need internal scaffolding composed of slender filaments known as microtubules. Before the cell can use microtubules for these and other essential functions, it must first organize ... Cell architecture: Finding common ground October 16, 2014 \nWhen it comes to cellular architecture, function follows form. Plant cells contain a dynamic cytoskeleton which is responsible for directing cell growth, development, movement, and division. So over time, changes in the cytoskeleton ... Drug candidate stabilizes essential transport mechanism in nerve cells January 31, 2017 \nTau is a key brain protein involved in Alzheimer's disease and other brain diseases. Aggregates of Tau known as \"neurofibrillary tangles\" have been associated with nerve cell death and cognitive decline. September 23, 2013 \nScientists have discovered an important mechanism in plant cells which regulates the direction that plant cells grow. Cell biology: new insights into the life of microtubules July 2, 2012 \nEvery second, around 25 million cell divisions take place in our bodies. This process is driven by microtubule filaments which continually grow and shrink. A new study shows how so-called motor proteins in the cytosol can ... Recommended for you Researchers   How   Human DNA softer than DNA single-celled life February 7, 2017 \nSingle-celled organisms have stiffer DNA than multicellular lifeforms like humans and rice. Theoretical physicists managed to simulate the folding in full genomes for the first time to reach this conclusion. Publication in ... Making a scavengerâ€”the meat-thieving traits that have stood the test of time February 7, 2017 \nTake a look at the teeth of any animal. The chances are you'll then have a good idea if it's a meat eater or a vegetarian. Sharp canines? Easy. All the better to eat you with. But how would you find out whether your chosen ...", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T02:06:51.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
