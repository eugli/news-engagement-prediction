In December, CEO Jack Dorsey said 80 percent of Square's workforce reports to five women on its leadership team, including Friar. \nDorsey is also the CEO of Twitter. When asked about his ability to lead two companies at once, Friar said \"I think our results speak for themselves.\" She added, \"Jack's built a great team around him, he knows where he needs to step in and own it and when he needs to delegate.\" \nSquare beat reported strong quarterly results Wednesday, beating analyst expectations with a loss of 4 cents per share on revenue of $452 million. \nShares gained more than 8 percent after hours to trade near $15.88, climbing past the stock's all-time closing high of $15.48.
