The museum directors escorted the first ladies around the facility and gave them a verbal tour of the 19th Smithsonian institution. They stopped by the Greensboro Lunch Counter, where four black residents of Greensboro, N.C., launched a sit-in at a restaurant inside the Woolworth department store on South Elm Street.\nTrump and Netanyahu's tour stopped at the statue of Thomas Jefferson to see the exhibit called \"The Paradox of Liberty,\" a reference to the founding father's owning slaves.\n  Trump had been expected to visit the latest Smithsonian museum on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 16, but did not end up visiting. In a report on Jan. 14, the museum said the White House and Secret Service had not reached out to them to plan the visit at that point. The trip was scheduled days after civil rights leader-turned-lawmaker, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., announced he would not attend Trump's inauguration.\nThe museum was first commissioned by Congress in 2003 and opened in September. Since then, more than 1 million people have passed through the building and seen the 36,000 artifacts on display.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T01:15:12.451+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
