But knowledge alone is not sufficient, 'certification as eligibility' also matters, which shows employers that you are serious about your career and eligible as you have demonstrated your technical ability in some form. I frequently receive emails and messages from my readers asking: Should I get certified?, Are certifications important to build up a career in IT?, What certifications can one get to start a career in information security? and more. These are some of the most frequent queries I came across, and in this article, I will attempt to answer these along with a solution on how to get started.

Usually one has to pay thousands of dollars for classes and then thousands for certification exams, but the good news is that all Cybrary's Micro Courses are free and Certification exams are conducted online at the cost of just $10 each — with one free retake per exam. \"The Cybrary community is working to make cybersecurity training available to anyone who wants it, anywhere. Training should not be exclusive to those who can afford to pay $5,000 per class. The same applies to certifications,\" said Ryan Corey, co-founder, Cybrary. \"Certifications are imperative to a cybersecurity career, and it’s important that we provide accessible and affordable education paths that will help reverse the growing need for skilled cybersecurity professionals.\" Here's the list of some selected certification courses that grabbed my attention and are important in the IT field: Cryptography", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T21:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T16:23:19.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
