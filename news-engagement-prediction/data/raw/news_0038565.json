Miller has the Flyers at 19-5 overall and 10-2 in the Atlantic, tied for first place with Virginia Commonwealth.\nHere is my 6pm Gottfried report: pic.twitter.com/QpIVEppC9B\n— Mark Armstrong (@ArmstrongABC11) February 13, 2017 Fred Demarest of NC State, who is the Wolfpack’s senior associate athletic director/communications and brand management, quickly responded on Twitter disputing the report.\nStatement on @PackMensBball and report earlier this evening: pic.twitter.com/JBlReNJpcn\n— Fred Demarest (@Fred_Demarest) February 14, 2017 NC State athletic director Debbie Yow had previously tweeted Feb. 8 in response to a Wolfpack fan her thoughts on Gottfried’s future.\n@wolfie_pack To all our faithful fans who follow me on twitter: I will address the season after it ends.\n— #1 state fan (@gopacknow) February 9, 2017 Gottfried reached the NCAA Tournament his first four years, including a pair of Sweet 16s. He has reached the tournament 11 times since 1995, between his coaching stints at NCSU, Alabama and Murray State and has a career-record of 400-229. Gottfried is expected to hold his normally scheduled pre-UNC game press conference this afternoon.\nThe Wolfpack feature one senior, reserve center BeeJay Anya, and have combo guard Thomas Allen signed for next year. Allen, who Rivals.com ranks No. 143 overall, also responded on social media about the swirling news in Raleigh, which is his hometown. Allen signed his letter of intent last November.\nI'm still 100% committed to NC State.\n— Thomas Allen (@TGABFY) February 14, 2017 ——\n• Talk about it inside The State of Basketball\n• Subscribe to our podcast on iTunes\n• Learn more about our print and digital publication, The Wolfpacker\n• Follow us on Twitter: @TheWolfpacker\n• Like us on Facebook\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://t.co/QpIVEppC9B", "https://twitter.com/gopacknow/status/829496848981360640", "https://twitter.com/TGABFY/status/831338297997803528", "https://www.facebook.com/TheWolfpacker/", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-wolfpacker-podcast/id452105230?mt=2", "https://twitter.com/Fred_Demarest/status/831296395881623553", "https://t.co/JBlReNJpcn", "https://twitter.com/ArmstrongABC11/status/831286832264536066", "http://thewolfpackeronline.com/the-wolfpacker-magazine-2/", "https://twitter.com/TheWolfpacker", "https://twitter.com/PackMensBball", "https://twitter.com/wolfie_pack"], "published": "2017-02-14T18:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T18:54:26.482+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
