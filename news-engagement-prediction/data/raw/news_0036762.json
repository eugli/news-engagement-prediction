Haglin revealed she had sex with the teenager almost daily (Photo: Mydrim Jones) \nHaglin must also register as a sex offender for 10 years. \nThe judge told her she could possibly qualify for a work release programme and could leave prison if she had a job. \nHe warned her that any problems after release could earn her additional penalties. \n\"Any violations of that section of terms of probation could result in additional consequences including an extension of the parole period or a revocation of parole,\" the judge said. \nHaglin told millions of viewers of TV programmes such as the Dr. Phil Show that the teen swept her off her feet after coming on strong and wooing her with handwritten notes and texts. \nHaglin said: “He did so with such intelligence and such an elevated vocabulary that I was completely duped by the whole facade.” \nThe bombshell interviews backfired on her when prosecutors turned her original misdemeanour charge into a more serious sexual exploitation one after saying they found new evidence from the recordings. \nBut Haglin ended up being shielded from the tougher charge by agreeing to let a judge rather than a jury rule on the misdemeanour charge without the talk show interviews being considered as evidence. Haglin began work as a lap dancer after leaving her job teaching (Photo: Mydrim Jones) \nHaglin, sacked as a supply teacher at Washington High School, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, was arrested after turning herself in to police in July. \nShe later claimed on TV that she became vulnerable to the student through a troubled relationship with her boyfriend. \nShe said “He caught me in my weakest moments, and he used that to his advantage. \n“I did ignore a lot of that at first because obviously, I knew that it was illegal, not allowed, frowned upon - everything.” Read More Primary school deputy head teacher who had sex with teenage girls banned from classroom for 10 years \nShe decided to respond to one of the student’s messages after a big bust-up with her boyfriend and they started their physical relationship in October 2015, she said. \nHe compared their relationship to The Graduate movie with Dustin Hoffman and once called her “Mrs. Robinson” after Anne Bancroft’s character \nHaglin told TV’s Dr. Phil in October: “We had sex - almost daily - in his car, my car, his mom’s house, and his dad’s house.” The teacher worked at Washington High School (Photo: Mydrim Jones) Haglin was sentenced to 360 days jail - but will only serve 90 (Photo: Mydrim Jones) \nShe said she tried to end the affair but claimed the pupil threatened to expose her if she tried to leave him. \nShe added: “When things got way out of control, and I wanted out, he began saying ‘I will light a match and burn your life down.’” \nHaglin said she was too scared to stop the relationship. But it ended after another student saw them together. \nShe showed no emotion when Judge Kevin McKeever found her guilty of sexual exploitation by a school employee, reported The Gazette.
