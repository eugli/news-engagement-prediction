The bedazzled red, white, and blue dress bore a string of text down the front, reading “Make America Great Again,” in all-caps. The gown’s train featured even bolder lettering which read “TRUMP.” Villa also carried a heart-shaped purse—\" My whole artistic platform is about LOVE!\" she told her Instagram followers . MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty \nVilla teased her look via Instagram, posting an image herself clad in the white cape she wore over the political gown. “Sneak Peek...#grammys2017 #grammys #joyvillagrammys #joyvilla #singerlife #singersongwriter #singer #style #grammysfashion #blessings #beautiful,” she wrote, sparing no hashtag.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T02:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:04:30.048+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
