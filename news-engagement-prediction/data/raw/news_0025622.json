Mr O'Driscoll, an Englishman, moved to Perth four years ago and said he had never seen such wet conditions Mr O'Driscoll, 32, said it was 'just lucky' his boss had a sea biscuit available at the right moment Mr O'Driscoll said he had lived in Perth for four years and never saw the city so wet. 'I've never seen rain like this before, it's very very very wet,' he said. 'A lot of the streets were cleared today, but it's still absolutely soaked.' While Perth was warned it would be hit with a large downpour overnight, Mr O'Driscoll said the sheer amount was a shock. 'We've heard them predict the rain, but when it rains in Perth it only rains for about 10 minutes then stops,' he said. 'It's nothing like this.' Mr O'Driscoll (pictured) said the sheer amount of rain which hit Perth overnight was a complete shock Mr O'Driscoll described the early morning stunt as 'just a bit of fun' and denied there was any real danger. 'If we thought there was any danger we wouldn't have done it,' he said. 'The water was only up to my knees.' The Liverpool born stuntman said the footage looked subdued compared to how it felt. 'It was hard to tell where the curves were, it actually felt a lot faster,' he said. 'A lot of people were just turning up to work when I came past on the sea biscuit, it was a bit of a laugh,' he said Since the footage was posted to Facebook about 10am Friday, it was shared, liked and viewed thousands of times. The video, now a viral sensation, had 22 thousand views within a couple of hours. Mr O'Driscoll said he had no idea it would garner so much attention. 'The most likes I've ever had before this was about nine,' he said. 'I was like buzzing when I got a hundred views, now my phone's going off every couple of seconds. It hasn't stopped all day.' The video, now a viral sensation, had 22 thousand views within a couple of hours of posting Perth was hit with the second heaviest downpour ever recorded in the Western Australian capital city, after it was inundated with 114 millimetres in the 24 hours leading up to Friday morning. The heavy rain, which caused widespread flooding, was the heaviest recorded since February 9, 1992 when Perth was hit with 120.6mm. Residents in areas worst hit were forced to evacuate homes due to rapid and powerful flooding of the Avon River. Emergency services warned residents to prepare for more flooding near the Murray River and Swan River catchments over the coming days.
