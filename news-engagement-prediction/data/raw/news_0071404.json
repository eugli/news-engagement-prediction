The CJI has ordered an open court hearing and she is expected to attend tomorrow. \n“I had given a petition on August 9 itself to the local police to file an FIR soon after my husband’s death. But Itanagar police ignored my petition. I want the help of the Supreme Court to begin the process of justice. I have demanded that the Supreme Court order the state police to get an FIR registered.” \n“On August 8 (the day before Pul was found hanging in his official residence) everything was fine,” Dangwimsai Pul recalled. “He was to go to Guwahati, he left home in the afternoon and returned by 7.30 pm.” \nWatch What Else Is making News \nDangwimsai is the eldest of the three wives of Kalikho Pul.

We can’t give it in the media.” \nIn her petition dated February 17, to the CJI, Dangwimsai said: “You are aware that a suicide note is like a dying declaration and is treated very seriously as evidence.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:33:48.932+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
