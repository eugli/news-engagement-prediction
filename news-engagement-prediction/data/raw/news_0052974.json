The trial was found to be successful but a feedback was drawn which required deployment of requisite security gadgets, CCTVs and smart cameras in the airports terminal before such an initiative can take off. \n\"Such infrastructure deployment is yet not complete at many airports, including some large ones,\" a senior CISF official said. \nLast year, the authorities had started trial run with respect to doing away with security stamp on hand baggage tags at these seven airports. \nBCAS said it is pertinent to mention that the trial run for the same has already been successfully conducted in two phases after putting in place the requisite surveillance and monitoring system. \nAbout the circular, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju said, \"We expect considerable improvement in security check time and passenger experience with this change\". \nA Civil Aviation Ministry official said the circular would be applicable for domestic as well as international passengers. \nBCAS has also said that airport operator shall ensure that the requisite monitoring system is maintained all through at PESC (Pre-embarkation Security Check) points. \nWhile BCAS said the circular would be effective immediately, CISF officials said that during a meeting of aviation regulators, airport operators and the CISF, it was decided that such measures should be deployed by March 31 so that all airports can be brought under the new initiative. \nMoreover, CISF is yet to receive an official copy of the circular, they added.
