Photo The writer, Helene Cooper, left, with her mother and her sister in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1972. WASHINGTON — When I was 13 years old, my family fled our home for the United States. We were refugees, even though we came here on visitor visas that we simply outstayed. The country of my birth, Liberia , had just seen a military coup, where enlisted soldiers took over the government, disemboweled the president and launched an orgy of retribution against the old guard. My father was shot. My cousin was executed on the beach by firing squad. My mom was gang-raped by soldiers in the basement of our house after she volunteered to submit to them on the condition that they leave my sisters and me, ages 8 to 16, alone. In the hours after it happened, my sisters and I huddled on the floor in my mom’s bedroom while she sat, silently, on the love seat, like a sentry keeping watch over us. In her lap she held a pistol. Twice that night, the soldiers came back, but each time they left again without entering the house.
