Paule George (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 4:26 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 4:26 p.m. ET \nIn the end, the price was just too high. \nMultiple teams inquired about Pacers star Paul George, but no one was willing to meet the lofty demands to acquire his services by Thursday's 3 p.m. ET NBA trade deadline. Now, the four-time all-star, averaging 22.3 points and 6.2 assists per game, will have to attempt to lead a 29-28 squad the rest of the way without much help other than budding second-year player Myles Turner (15.6 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 2.1 bpg). \nThe Celtics and Nuggets were the most aggressive suitors in the race for George, one of the NBA's best small forwards along with LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Kawhi Leonard, but, in the end, Celtics Legend Larry Birds simply wanted too much to part ways with his talented 27-year-old. \nThe Pacers, currently sixth in the Eastern Conference standings, reportedly wanted three among a group of four Boston players, including Avery Bradley, Marcus Smart, Jae Crowder and Jaylen Brown, the No. 3 overall selection in the 2016 draft, as well as a 2017 pick the Celtics got from the Nets. On his trade deadline show, The Vertical's Adrian Wojnarowski said the Nuggets believed they found their franchise player in center Nikola Jokic, and refused to include the 6-10, 250-pounder in any package for George. The 22-year-old Jokic has been good for 20.1 points and 11.1 rebounds and 6.3 assists per game in his last 10 contests. \nNBA TRADE RUMORS: Latest news, updates on deadline day \nGeorge signed a five-year, $91.5 million extension in 2013. He can opt out of his current deal at the end of next season and will become an unrestricted free agent, following the 2018-2019 season. \nSome believe George, a California native, already has sights set on returning to the land of sun and switches. I repeat: Paul George - barring a title chance in Indy - is hell-bent on heading for Laker Land. This message has been sent throughout NBA. â€” Sam Amick (@sam_amick) February 23, 2017 \nIf that's the case, it makes sense why newly-minted Lakers President of Basketball Operation Magic Johnson didn't make a strong push for George. Los Angeles can win in the long run if it can can get George to come back home next summer and join a young nucleus that includes Julius Randle (12.9 ppg, 8.1 rpg), D'Angelo Russell (14. 2 ppg, 4.7 apg, 3.8 rpg) and Jordan Clarkson (13.7 ppg). The Pacers have a season and half to try and change his mind. With a roster that drops off tremendously after Jeff Teague, the Pacers third-leading scorer at 15.4 points per game, George needs help to maximize his prime and remain competitive in an Eastern Conference dominated by the Cavaliers, Celtics, the surging Wizards and Raptors. \nIndiana and Boston, No. 2 in the East behind the Cavaliers, wound up not making any moves. Denver sent a protected pick to Milwaukee in exchange for Bucks center Roy Hibbert, to add depth to its frontcourt.
