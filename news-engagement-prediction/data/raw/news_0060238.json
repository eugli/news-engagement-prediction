(DAY2 BLOG) \nComing on to bat in the second innings, Australia had 143 runs on the board for the loss of four wickets, after bundling out India for a paltry 105 to walk off with a healthy lead of 298 at the end of the day. Earlier, it was a shambolic collapse for the hosts who lost seven wickets in just 11 runs as O’Keefe spun a web around the Indian batsmen. (SCORECARD) \nAt 93 for the loss of three wickets, India may not have been in a comfortable position, but KL Rahul and Ajinkya Rahane had done enough to help them claw back after a twin strike by Mitchell Starc sent captain Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujar packing in the same over. \nIt was a brilliant breakthrough for Australia , who had managed to put up 260 on the board in their first innings after Ashwin had overnight hero Mitchell Starc caught at deep mid-wicket in the very first over of the day. \nPujara was gone off to a delivery that came up to his chest and while trying to fend it, he let the ball take a slight edge off his gloves to go flying at Matthew Wade behind the stumps. That, however, did little to deter the Pune crowd from cheering and celebrating as Virat Kohli came out to take guard. \nTwo balls later, it had to stop, all too sudden for anyone to come to terms with it, as Kohli chased a wide delivery outside off-stump, and gave a sharp catch to Peter Handscomb at first slip. Since then, apart from a few odd boundaries, a few Australian wickets and when the television cameras hovered around them, that uncanny silence was never broken.
