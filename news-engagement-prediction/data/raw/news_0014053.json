It just is. It is how we best equip our children to thrive and to give them the highest chance to live up to their fullest potential. It also is how a nation can best secure its own long-term progress, by having a competitively educated workforce. Good education is also an intensely personal issue and a heartfelt ambition we have for our children. If you are a parent you know what I mean. \nI also think we can agree that our current educational system can be progressed in so many ways, at least in relation to the new opportunities and requirements that technology now provides. There are not many topics that are more researched than education, and there is a noisy choir of endless voices that sing their own version of the “how to improve education” song, rarely in harmony. But looking at the results, internationally as well as in Malaysia, progress is rather slow.\nSo, what could I add to this complex picture, not being in this sector myself? Well, I am a so-called businessman (however confining that sounds), so I decided to take a strictly, nearly cartoonish, business manager’s perspective on education.\nFirst, the scope of the case at hand can be made straightforward: the question is how we best educate our children, up to and inclusive of high school. The problem statement is also fairly clear. Too many stakeholders are unhappy that educational quality is not an area of concern. The results for many countries, and Malaysia among them, are that their students are significantly underperforming compared with their best international peers. So what is causing this unhappiness and results? Broadly we can group the concerns into a few categories. \n> Variable quality of teachers. Maybe not a surprising finding, but a widely-held view is that large segments of the teachers are out of touch with emerging needs from businesses and societies. The best teachers are fantastic and there are many of them. But you are still subjected to just that pool of teachers who happen to be at whatever location you are at, and the chance that you get an experience that is a long way from international benchmarks is pretty high. \n> Lack of relevant technologies. As most of us know, there is a tremendous potential in technology to provide our students with quality, interactive up-to-date information and educational support. Technology has the potential to bridge the impossible; and make global high standards available everywhere, including to the less fortunate and rural areas. But as we speak, little is actually (well) implemented. \n> Too much focus on exams. The overriding goal seems to be getting into a good university, which is reached through good grades, which is achieved by remembering facts and knowing the mechanics of key principles, particularly in science. But does this really prepare a person to succeed in real life situations? To succeed in large organisations or as an entrepreneur one needs to be also good at collaboration, persuasion, creative logic, communication, people management, and a good dose of self-awareness, empathy, critical thinking as well as a passion for growth and change. Schools don’t prepare us well for these things. \n> Focus on subjects, not on the student as a subject. Most schools are striving to have good results, but they are not in the position to guide and inspire the individual student to reach his or her highest potential and to be successful in overcoming challenges. Many schools don’t have the capacity to deal with an individual’s unique needs and potential; the students are classes, not a collection of individuals. \nTechnology can’t replace teachers, but it can empower them and their students. \nThese are heavy concerns, they have been there for a long time, and they are not easily addressed. There isn’t a lack of opinions and efforts, from state-sponsored programmes, think-tanks, experts, consultants, experimental efforts, private schools, massive donations to new promising initiatives. But we are looking at an oil tanker, going the wrong way, everybody sees it but no one seems to be able to change its course. \nNow, I am sure there are many examples of segmented good progress, good results as well as student growth and development. But I think progress for mainstream students is just too slow, and we are losing a generation of current students in a sense that we didn’t give them what they deserved and what the society needed them to be.\nSo, as a business problem, we see the scope, the causes of the problem and the many initiatives to change the situation.\nThen what? Let’s take a step back. If you are a student, you are pretty much like a book buyer a few years ago. You are subjected to the quality of the local book store, what they happen to have inside, how good the book seller happens to be, how much investment has been put into this location, and so on. This is the same situation for our students, it is a gamble, whether you are lucky or not with the store (or school) close to you. And the risk/reward is not about the quality of a book, it is about your own future.\nWhat the book store has gone through is a revolution, driven by a business model enabled by technology. Suddenly the most rural child can buy books better than the most privileged child visiting the best book store in the world. \nI’m thinking about education in a similar way. As a business problem, I see that the problem doesn’t have a credible solution and that ongoing efforts are unlikely to yield results for children in current mainstream education. Therefore, I think we need a radical business model change, where we challenge and change how we teach, what we teach, who is teaching, how we measure success and how we fund our education. Yes, there are thousands of small answers out there, but I would like to focus on a big one, which is that; we are unlikely to get significant educational progress without a radical business model change, just like what book purchasing has gone through. Something like;\n> Any student, wherever he or she is, whatever the social background, must be able to choose content from the best sources in the world.\n> Any student must be able to acquire skills and knowledge in an individually-adopted way, that allows for a combination of being taught, participating in group learning and also interactive digital learning.\n> Any student should be able to participate in an extended community of peers, experts, teachers and parents, where learning is discussed and individual progress tracked.\n> Any student should be offered opportunities to grow personally and socially towards his or her fullest potential to participate in the demands of society. \nNone of the objectives are met today. All of the objectives can be met by rethinking the education business model and by leveraging technology. The solutions are out there for us to grab. If this was a business, I think this problem would be solved. Instead of spelling out further what that means, I think I’ll leave it there as food for thought. \nMorten Lundal is CEO of Maxis Bhd", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:46:57.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
