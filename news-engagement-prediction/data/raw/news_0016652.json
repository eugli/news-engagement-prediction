TNN | Feb 7, 2017, 03.42 PM IST Ranveer Singh replicates SRK’s ‘DDLJ’ train stunt, fails miserably Ranveer Singh is a pro at pulling off Shah Rukh Khan 's most famous scenes from his iconic movies. The 'Befikre' actor recently imitated SRK's memorable train sequence from 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge' in the funniest manner possible. Ranveer played SRK, swinging by the train door, extending an outstretched arm to his Simran, in this case choreographer Ganesh Acharya . The dance director runs towards Ranveer, and rather being pulled aboard the train by Ranveer, he manages to pull the actor out of the coach. The actor shared this funny video with the warning, \"This stunt is performed by trained Filmys. Do not try this at home. Or at the train station.\" Ranveer will soon be seen as Alauddin Khilji in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's 'Padmavati' which stars Deepika Padukone in the title role and Shahid Kapoor as her husband.
