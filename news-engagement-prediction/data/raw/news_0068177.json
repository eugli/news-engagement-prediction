Boy, he wouldn't stop asking questions,\" Mackanin said after a 9-4 Grapefruit League loss Friday afternoon against the Yankees. \"It was nice to see, but it was like, 'Come on. Are you trying to brown- nose me or what.' Then after watching him work and watching him pitch today, he's a pretty solid guy.\"\nThe inquisitive Pivetta impressed his manager with a pair of scoreless innings. Mackanin marveled at the righthander's poise, praising the way Pivetta handled a ground ball to start a double play with a throw to second base. Pivetta struck out three, walked one, and allowed a hit.\nPivetta spent last season between double-A Reading and triple-A Lehigh Valley, where he will likely return to start the season. This was the 24-year-old's first time facing major-league hitters. He used his curveball to strike out Aaron Judge and his slider to fool Brett Gardner. It was just two innings - and yes, this is February - but Pivetta looked strong.\nThe Phillies invited 30 pitchers to spring training and 14 of them are considered starters. Of the starters, 11 are 25 or younger. Certainly, not all of those pitchers will find success in the major leagues. But it will be a win if just a handful of those lottery tickets hit. Pivetta, who was acquired from Washington in 2015 for Jonathan Papelbon, could be a winner.\n\"We're all searching for the same goal here,\" Pivetta said. \"We all want to play in the big leagues with this team. I wish everyone could do the same as me. We all want to. We're driving every single day to go out and play hard and achieve their goals, too.\"\nPivetta pitched in relief of Alec Asher, who allowed a homer in the first inning before settling in. Asher struck out two, walked none, and allowed two hits in two innings. He added a cutter to his pitch repertoire, a season after finding success with an added two-seam fastball.\nAsher, 25, appears to be on the outside of a triple-A rotation that is lining up to be Pivetta, Zach Eflin, Ben Lively, Mark Appel, and Jake Thompson. The Phillies could elect this spring to convert Asher into a reliever, a role that could earn the righthander a spot in the major-league bullpen.\n\"It's something we won't know until it happens,\" Asher said. \"I'm just out there trying to pitch, get guys out, and I'll go where I go.\"\nPivetta has been in Clearwater since Jan. 15 as he reported to spring training just a few days after that meeting with Mackanin. It is a great situation, he said. But his time in camp will be short. Pivetta leaves in about a week to join Team Canada for the World Baseball Classic.\nPlaying for his country, which he did as a teenager, is a \"lifelong dream.\" It is as important, the pitcher said, as making his major-league debut. But before joining Canada, Pivetta has a few more questions to ask in spring training.\n\"Let's put it this way: Over the years you come across guys that are like that and you know in the end that they're just trying to get on your good side,\" Mackanin said. \"But this guy is genuine. Just the way he pitched today, tells me he's genuine.\"\nmbreen@phillynews.com\n@matt_breen www.philly.com/\nphilliesblog\nMore Coverage POLL: Can the Phillies be a .500 team this season?
