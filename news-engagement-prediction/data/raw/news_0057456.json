Mumbai: Justin Bieber is scheduled to perform in India for the first time in May this year and going by the looks of it, the organisers are leaving no stone unturned to make it a grand success.\nThe sale of tickets have already started on Wednesday and the event also looks likely to be a star-studded affair.\n‘Student of the Year’ stars Alia Bhatt, Sidharth Malhotra and Varun Dhawan have been approached to a be part of the concert.\nArjun Jain, director of White Fox India, told mid-day, \"We have already received confirmation from some of the biggest celebrities in India for the concert and will try to definitely integrate indigenous elements into the event. We are considering bringing Alia, Sidharth and Varun on stage, like they did in their first film. However, things are in the planning stage now.”\nWhile the three stars made their debuts together and also featured together on their mentor Karan Johar’s chat show ‘Koffee with Karan’ and the Dream Team Tour, they have not been spotted together all that often.\nWhile Alia and Sidharth are reportedly dating, reports of Varun not getting along with the couple have often made the rounds. So it would be interesting to see the trio come together after a long time.\nThe performances of the three stars could just be one of the star attractions on the show and we could see several other celebrities coming together like we saw recently when Coldplay and other artistes had arrived in Mumbai for the Global Citizen concert.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:26:37.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
