The sanctions were similar to actions taken by the Obama administration targeting Iran's ballistic missile network.“Nefarious Iranian behavior cannot go unchecked,” CEO of the American Jewish Committee David Harris said on Friday. “Rigorous monitoring of Iran’s compliance with the [Iran deal] and related international measures, such as the UN ban on ballistic missile tests, is imperative to successfully curtailing Iran’s threats to regional and global security.”The Anti-Defamation League too welcomed the move and said the sanctions are a critical tool to “exert pressure on Tehran to address the full range of threats Iran poses to US interests and to stop its destabilizing aggression.”“The Trump administration’s swift and targeted response today sends an important signal that the US remains, and will continue to be, serious about holding the regime in Tehran accountable for its behavior,” the organization’s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said. “We hope others in the international community will follow suit and will refuse to allow Iran’s dangerous threats to be met with impunity.”President Trump tweeted early on Friday that \"Iran is playing with fire\" and \"they don't appreciate how kind President Obama was to them. Not me!\" The President plans to impose sanctions on several Iranian entities, seeking to ratchet up pressure on Tehran while crafting a broader strategy to counter what he sees as its destabilizing behavior, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.Stephen Greenberg and Malcolm Hoenlein of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations added that by imposing new sanctions of Iran the Trump Administration “took another step toward holding Iran accountable for its provocative and belligerent behavior which threatens Israel and other US allies in the region and vital US national security interests.”“We look forward to working with the administration and the bipartisan majority in Congress on appropriate and effective responses to Iran’s repeated provocations and belligerence,” they said.
