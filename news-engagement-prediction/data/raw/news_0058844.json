On Oct. 15, she was punched in a shocking attack caught on surveillance video. \nGRANDMOTHER REPORTEDLY DIES AFTER TEEN LEARNING TO DRIVE HITS HER WITH CAR \n\nRichard “Kwasi” Springer, 29, was arrested about two weeks after the attack, outside of King Deli in Jamaica. After allegedly punching Gentillon, he fled with a $3.50 can of beer that he paid $1 for. \nHe was initially charged with first-degree robbery and second-degree assault, but now the NYPD is reclassifying the incident as a homicide following Gentillon’s death. \nThe grandmother of two was on her way to meet fellow church congregants before she was attacked.
