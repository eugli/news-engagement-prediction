Ad Feedback \nHowever, Judge Michael Turner said jail was the only option. \n\"We are numb and in disbelief that this has happened because we weren't expecting it,\" Linda Mitchell said. \nMitchell's partner Emily Hart said it felt unjust. \nComplicating the situation was confusion over the charge Mitchell faced. \nThe hard copy charge sheet in the court accused Mitchell of \"carelessly driving a motor vehicle\" while the summary of facts, the digital archive and other disclosure documents used the words \"aggravated\" careless driving, leading the family to think the charge had been amended. \nHowever, police prosecutor Sergeant Ian Collin said Mitchell pleaded and was sentenced on the right charge; a section 62 (1) under the Land Transport Act. \nJudges, police and lawyers referred to this charge as \"aggravated careless driving ... the same\", Collin said. \nGrubb's father, Jeff Grubb, said he preferred not to comment on the sentence. \nLinda Mitchell spoke with her son by phone at the Otago Corrections Facility in Milton on Wednesday and said he was \"flat\". \n\"He sounded bloody terrible.\" \nMitchell was concerned for his two-year-old daughter he shared custody of with a former partner and whether an appeal had been lodged, she said. \nWhat was happening with Mitchell's daughter was \"up in the air\" as was his employment as an engineer. \nIt could be a month before the family could visit Mitchell, she said. \n\"It doesn't just affect Cody being locked up in prison. It just goes right down the chain,\" Linda Mitchell said. \nSensible Sentencing Trust founder Garth McVicar said without knowing the intricacies of the case, there appeared to be grounds for appeal. The sentence appeared to be harsh. \n\"It's certainly at the upper end with some of the cases we've been involved in...A lot of the cases that are worse than that end with home detention.\" \nThe fact it was a quad bike incident did not help Mitchell as quad bikes had been in the spotlight recently, he said. \nBy October last year, official figures put the number of quad bike-related deaths at 11, a record. \n\"[But] there's a few oddities there...It really opens it up for an appeal,\" he said. \nVictoria University associate professor of law Dr Yvette Tinsley felt Mitchell had been charged correctly. \n\"It seems to me like he's pleaded and been sentenced to the right charge.\" \nThe influence of drinking and drug taking constituted \"aggravated\", she said. \nTinsley had seen sentences on this charge range from home detention to jail time but preferred not to comment on this case specifically. \nAnother law professor, who preferred not to be identified, said Mitchell should have been advised to plead not guilty in the hope his lawyer could have the charge downgraded. \nMitchell was a \"likely candidate\" for home detention in his opinion. \nThe summary of facts said Grubb fell from the back of Mitchell's bike after the pair and two others decided to use the bike for transport to a party in Cromwell. All were intoxicated and wore no helmets. \nMitchell and the two friends took Grubb home instead of calling emergency services thinking he was not seriously injured and just really drunk. Another friend called an ambulance about an hour later and he was flown to Dunedin. \nHis life support was turned off five days later. \nMitchell went to Grubb's bedside the following morning after learning he was critically injured.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T10:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:56:19.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
