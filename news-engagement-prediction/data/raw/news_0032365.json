Apart from those gravity-defying strokes that he plays in his incredible innings now-a-days, there’s not much we look forward to because the guy himself doesn’t like to emote much upon reaching key milestones. © Twitter \nBut guess what? For all of you die-hard fans of Kohli, we have a litmus test ready. Do you remember how many sixes Virat has hit in his four double centuries? \nIs it 10? Or 6, or is it just 3? \nIf your answer is anything more than 1, you’re wrong. Virat Kohli has just hit one six in his four double-century innings and, \nthat six too came in the 235-run knock against England at Wankhede. © Twitter \nVirat Kohli is a calculated risk-taker and that is one of the major strengths of the right-handed batsman. He seldom goes for the biggies and that serves him well in longer innings because he is able to control the situation much better with his ground strokes. And it is also a skill that the Indian captain has developed over time. \nSixes or not, we are just happy with him scoring those big doubles every series. After double against West Indies, New Zealand, England and Bangladesh, all we can say is – Dear Australia, please come soon. \nPhoto: © Twitter (Main Image)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T06:21:10.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
