Dude mentions Michael Jackson not winning anything for “Bad”, but “Thriller” won AOTY and the year after that Lionel Richie won. Know who else never won any Grammys? The Who, Led Zeppelin, Queen. Other than a video, Bowie never won anything until this year and that was probably mainly due to his death.

By: Thanksgiving Chimp 02.13.2017 @ 1:23 PM \nDon’t just tell me who never won. Tell me who they lost to. Beyoncé didn’t lose to Jethro Tull or Steely Dan, she lost to fucking Adele. Both albums were excellent, so either was a deserving choice. So while Nad has never won, who beat him those 11 times? Who beat Snoop those 16 times? \nAnd Jay-Z has never won AOTY, but has any piece of work he’s done deserved it? Has he ever put out the undisputed best album of any year he has released music? \nAgain, I get the frustration, but it’s not enough to just say “[Person X] has never won” you also have to show who beat them to give full context to everything.

Even with that, it’s still clear that the Grammies are usually out on things they deem rock or ‘urban’ in the ‘big’ categories.
