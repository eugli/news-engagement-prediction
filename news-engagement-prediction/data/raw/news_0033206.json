Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA woman was left stunned after a man she ditched after just one date sent his bank details and demanded that she refund him the cash he spent on drinks. \nEven though the date went well and Lucy Brown, 38, thought the man was \"normal and sweet\", she texted him to let him know she wasn't interested in a second date. \nThe Londoner couldn't believe it when he replied to tell her he was \"devastated\" and he wanted a \"contribution\" for the drinks he bought her. \nThe man she met on Plenty of Fish told her to pay \"her share\" - £42.50 - and gave his bank account number and sort code at the bottom of the WhatsApp message. The man told Lucy he had spent around £85 on their date (Photo: Mercury Press) \nLucy was only on her second date after joining the dating apps Plenty of Fish and Tinder after her three-year long relationship ended just before Christmas last year.

But then I realised he was serious. Lucy says she thought the man's message was a joke (Photo: Mercury Press) \n\"Everyone in my office has been snorting and crying with laughter at the text too.

Happy for you to do what you feel is right, especially considering my badly damaged feelings atm.\" \nLucy said: \"I am a bit surprised - how can he be so devastated about just one date? \n\"I only ended up with his watch because we were both messing around and he was wearing my hat, so in return he gave me it to wear.

I just text him back saying 'eeyore'.\" \nLucy's dating life has become such a topic of ridicule in her office that her colleagues even suggested she write a book about her misfortune and include dating disasters from both her and her friend's experiences on Tinder and other dating apps. \nShe added: \"I'd say this guy who asked for his money back was definitely the weirdest date I'd ever had.\" Like us on Facebook ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T18:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T13:18:33.930+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
