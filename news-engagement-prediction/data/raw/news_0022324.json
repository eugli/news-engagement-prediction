A third one under construction is the model for a new reactor in the UK. \nThe cause of the blast was not immediately known. \nOne of the older reactors was shut down after the blast which, according to Ouest-France newspaper, happened in a machine room at about 10:00 (09:00 GMT). \nThe incident was declared over at 11:00. \nBritain's proposed new plant, Hinkley Point C, is set to begin generating electricity in 2025. \nThursday's explosion was reported by the prefecture in the Manche region, close to the Channel Islands. \nIn 2015, a weakness, believed to be a construction fault, was discovered in the steel housing the reactor core at the reactor under construction in Flamanville. What is Hinkley Point and why is it important? \nThe EPR water pressurised reactor being built at Flamanville, a third-generation design, is years behind schedule. \nAnti-nuclear activists have protested over the project, with at least 2,700 people turning out to demonstrate in October.
