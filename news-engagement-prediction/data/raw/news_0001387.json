Before that, Mike Hager spoke to the imam and told him he was going to Iraq to be with the woman, who suffered from kidney disease. \nAl-Hussainy added that he had learnt about the woman’s death through Facebook posts and worshippers at his mosque. \n“I don’t want to say he lied. I don’t know what Mike said. But Muslims have to tell the truth,” Al-Hussainy said, as cited by AP.

Hager is a US citizen, but other family members are not, and they had to remain in Iraq. \nLast week, an executive order signed by US President Donald Trump imposed a blanket ban on all Syrian asylum-seekers until “sufficient changes” are made to the refugee program, and barred entry for the citizens of six other Arab countries. \nThe order also halted all refugee admissions for at least 120 days, or four months. \nThe measure has caused immense uproar, with thousands protesting in US airports and all over the country for days. \nHowever, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows that more Americans (49 percent) support the ban than disapprove (41 percent). At the same time, 31 percent of the respondents said the ban made them feel safer, while 26 percent said it made them feel less safe, and 43 percent said they “didn’t know.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T16:46:47.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
