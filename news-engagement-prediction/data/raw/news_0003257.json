Celebrity Big Brother committed a huge gaffe when Coleen Nolan left the house The Loose Woman was voted the winner of the latest reality series- but her exit from the house didn't quite go to plan   Yikes! Someone will be in trouble for this one. Did you spot the mistake?   \nColeen Nolan's victory exit from the Celebrity Big Brother House was tainted by an embarrassing production error. \nAs the Nolan sister stepped out to huge applause minutes after being crowned the queen of the house, she was greeted by a huge banner with the graphics boldly saying 'evicted' rather than the usual 'winner'. \nAlso, none of the five finalists were evicted, as viewers had been voting to save them, with a non nomination process taking place in the final days. \nThe Loose Woman did not seem to notice the huge gaffe as she lapped up the adoration from the crowd and headed down the stairs to a hug from show host Emma Willis. \nBut viewers were quick to spot the blunder on Friday night, which appeared to, in fact, brand champion Coleen a loser. \n\"I need him in my life\" Coleen Nolan reveals she missed husband Ray Fensome while in Celebrity Big Brother \nTaking to Twitter, fans vented their confusion. \nOne posted: \"Did producers get the results wrong? Notice how it said Coleen was evicted on the graphics when she left the house\" while another added \"Shame on you! When #CBBColeen got evicted the display read 'Evicted'. It should have said 'Winner'. C5 you are a failure. C4 was best.\" \nA third user added : \"It said EVICTED! when Coleen left the house? Usually it would say WINNER!\", while another added: \"Fail by the producers\". (Photo: PA) \nBut the whole debacle appeared to completely pass Coleen by, who expressed her shock at beating Jedward in leaving the famous house last. \nEmotional Coleen Nolan WINS Celebrity Big Brother 2017 \nIn an emotional interview with Emma, she said: “I can honestly say it’s one of the best things in my life. I’m 52 soon and this means so much to me. \n“I’ve never won anything in my life on my own ever. I feel really, really lucky and thankful to everybody who voted.” \nShe said she didn’t feel she deserve to win as she’d been 'quite boring' but 'normal'. \nCleaning expert Kim Woodburn finished third, ahead of James Cosmo and Nicola Mclean respectively.
