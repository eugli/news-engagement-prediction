Bookmark this page for the latest updates. \nThe premise \nMurphy revealed that season seven will tackle the 2016 presidential election that saw former reality host-turned-Republican candidate Donald Trump shockingly defeat former first lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Season seven \"is going to be about the election that we just went through so I think that will be interesting for a lot of people,\" Murphy told Andy Cohen while promoting his new FX anthology series Feud . When pressed for details from Cohen, particularly whether there will be a character based on now-President Trump, Murphy responded with a coy \"maybe.\" \nWhen speaking to press during the Television Critics Association's winter press tour in January, FX president John Landgraf offered few details about what the marketing and promotion for the next installment would look like. Season six's theme was kept under wraps and a series of more than 20 cryptic promos offered little to no information. Of season seven's marketing hook, Landgraf said \"Ryan has yet another really innovative idea for how to do something fresh and different with the franchise that audiences haven't seen before.\" \nThe cast \nConfirmed to return are frequent Murphy leading lady Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters . Roanoke featured Paulson and Peters as a married pair of actors who fell in love on set, much to the delight of viewers of the longtime franchise. While the co-stars have stepped into many roles over the course of the franchise — Paulson has played seven, with two of characters making cameos on subsequent seasons, and Peters, six — the two had never been linked up romantically. \nHow it connects to previous AHS seasons \nPaulson's character reprisals are some of the examples of how AHS has hinted that the anthology exists within the same universe, but it wasn't until Roanoke that Murphy confirmed all the seasons are indeed connected. Each of the first six episodes corresponded to their respective cycles of Murder House , Asylum , Coven , Freak Show and Hotel , and Murphy revealed that Lady Gaga's Witch of the Woods is the original Supreme witch responsible for season three's Coven witches. Viewers can expect to see the franchise's interconnected ways \"explode\" come season seven. \"You'll see it in season six, and then you'll really see it after,\" Murphy told THR ahead of Roanoke 's premiere about connecting the dots. \"We lay a lot of pipe, and you'll see it explode in seasons seven and eight.\" \nMurphy also promised that the franchise will return to Coven to tie the Gaga reveal and that one season — or perhaps the same season — will be a Murder House and Coven crossover. \nA premiere date for American Horror Story season seven has not yet been determined.
