He died Saturday at his home in Brazil at the age of 26. Fab Melo (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 9:07 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 9:07 p.m. ET \nFab Melo, who was the Big East Defensive Player of the Year in 2012, died Saturday at the age of 26 at his mother's home in Brazil. \nMelo, who was selected by the Boston Celtics in the 22nd overall pick of the 2012 NBA Draft, was a two-year standout at Syracuse University. The Brazilian native struggled to learn English, which caused him to be declared ineligible for the 2012 NCAA Tournament for academic reasons. \nMORE: Notable sports deaths of 2017 \nMelo's academic eligibility was part of the NCAA investigation that led to Syracuse self-imposing a postseason ban for the 2014-15 season. \n\"He was a really good kid, and it's not fair that he will be defined by one thing: a 10-page paper,\" Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim told ESPN shortly after hearing Melo had died. \"He worked his tail off to become a really good player and was a nice kid.\" \nHis NBA career lasted just one season and only six games. The 7-foot Brazilian native had most recently played for Brasília of the Brazilian Novo Basquete Brasil league. The cause of death was not immediately known. His mother was the one who found him unresponsive in his bed. \nMelo's Brazilian team confirmed his death on Twitter, saying it was \"sad news for Brazilian basketball.\" \n\"It's so hard right now, so hard to believe,\" Boeheim added to ESPN. \"It's a sad, sad day.\" Watch This ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T09:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T04:10:32.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
