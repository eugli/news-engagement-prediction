I spoke three languages fluently but communicated best in English. This was simultaneously the bane and boon of my existence; at certain times, it’d help me cut across race barriers to relate to friends from different cultural backgrounds but other times, it’d be perceived as the aloofness of being “an outsider”. \nIt took my first trip back to my country of origin for me to realise that I was truly a Malaysian at heart. I couldn’t wait to return to Malaysia, and one hour after exiting KLIA when I came back, I was at a mamak outlet, wolfing down a delicious packet of nasi lemak washed down with some sweet teh tarik . \nHere are some of those very Malaysian things I learnt to appreciate: \n1. The food, obviously: Who could say no to the melting pot of delicious food from different cultures in this one country? Here, it’s possible to enjoy a roti tampal at mamak outlets at any hour of the day, some hearty dim sum , chee cheong fun or tau sah piah at any of the Chinese restaurants and the heavenly seafood at affordable prices (if you know where to find them, which isn’t hard if you have many Chinese friends). The endless varieties of fusion food, hipster joints and cafes sprouting up in KL are testament to how quickly Malaysian society adapts to external influences and improvises to come up with unique creations like salted egg yolk croissants and nasi lemak cheese cake. \n2. Road culture: The fact that the roads are a jungly mess with oodles of “your mother’s road ah ” rules thrown in and yet we manage to get home in one piece with most of our sanity intact. The amazing thing I have realised is that Malaysians – except for some bad apples but these are present in any community – are a very patient and tolerant lot. It’s rare to hear more than one continuous honk and we are, more often than not, obliging enough to queue as long as it takes behind an uncle who doesn’t quite know how to reverse out of a parking lot or we “ kasih chance” to errant drivers going or coming out of the wrong exits at petrol stations. Even if there is an accident, it is rare to see aggressive arguing and behaviour between the parties. Although it is Malaysian culture to stop and stare at even the smallest of accidents, thus causing massive jams, there are no wound down windows or vitriolic cursing from the ever toiling denizens on the roads. I guess this just highlights the high level of tolerance in this country which allows for the many races to co-exist peacefully. \n3. The language: Although Bahasa Malaysia may be the official language of the country, few other countries can boast of having a medium of communication accessible by every race in the country. Which other country can boast of the ability to order food using four languages: “ Macha , one roti canai tapau boleh ?” The differences may be many but it’s those differences that actually incorporate diversity as a crucial tenet of being Malaysian. \n4. The holidays: I can safely say that few other countries have as many national holidays as Malaysia – Thaipusam, Hari Raya, Christmas, Chinese New Year and etc. Hey, who doesn’t like days off from work? \n5. The weather: I initially hated the tropical climate, the heat and endless rain during monsoon season. It was only when my cousin visited from a four-season country that I became aware of how much I took for granted the limitless sunshine and tropical, evergreen lushness and beauty of the Malaysian landscape. We have a wealth of natural landscapes for avid hikers to throw themselves at. It is not cheap to have different types of clothing for different seasons, mind you. \nSometimes, it takes a non-Malaysian to truly step back and appreciate everything good this country has to offer. It’s not without its share of problems but you had me at nasi lemak , Malaysia! \nSU KYAW", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:34:05.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
