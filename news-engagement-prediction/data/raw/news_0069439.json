Main iss sadi ke sabse bade mahanayak se kahunga ke ab aap Gujarat ke gadhon ka prachar mat kariye (There’s an ad on TV which shows donkeys. I appeal to century’s biggest star, please stop endorsing the donkeys of Gujarat),” Akhilesh said. \n“What will happen if the donkeys also start getting advertised?,” the UP CM later asked the audience. \nThe bitter remarks came at a time when parties are racing to the finish line of the state polls described by many as the semi-final before the 2019 Union election. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:13:47.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
