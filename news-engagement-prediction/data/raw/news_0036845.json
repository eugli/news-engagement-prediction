advantage PUBLISHED : Friday, 17 February, 2017, 8:17pm UPDATED : Friday, 17 February, 2017, 9:02pm Jury still out in Donald Tsang trial 17 Feb 2017 \nHong Kong’s former leader Donald Tsang Yam-kuen has been found guilty of misconduct in office, making him the first chief executive to be convicted in a criminal trial. \nA nine-member jury found Tsang guilty on Friday of one count of misconduct in public office, but not guilty on another misconduct count between 2010 and 2012, when he was Hong Kong’s leader. \nBut the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of a chief executive accepting an advantage, which alleged that Tsang accepted a bribe in the form of HK$3.35 million in renovations on the Shenzhen penthouse where he intended to retire. \nAfter hearing four weeks of evidence from the prosecution, including testimony from former chief secretary Henry Tang Ying-yen and current chief executive hopeful Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, the jury retired on Thursday morning and took 20 hours across two days to reach its guilty verdict. \nTsang was granted bail and was expected to return to court on Monday. \nHe stood stern as he heard the verdict before turning slightly to look at his wife. \nHe touched his lips and looked down as the judge went on to thank the jury for their service. \nTsang’s son, Thomas Tsang Hing-shun, sobbed as he was then reunited in a conference room with his father. \nOnly hours before the jury returned their decision on Friday, Tsang kissed his wife Selina Tsang Pou Siu-mei on the cheek as they left a private room at the court. \nA number of Tsang’s family members were present in court to show their support, including his two sons Simon Tsang Hing-yin and Thomas Tsang Hing-shun. \nHis sister Katherine Tsang King-suen and brothers Norman Tsang Yam-huen, Charles Tsang Yam-chuen and former police commissioner Tsang Yam-pui were also in court. \nThe jury heard two conflicting accounts of Tsang’s character during the six-week trial. \nThe prosecution painted him as a greedy, two-faced liar who had used his public position to collude with rich businessmen for personal gain, while the defence claimed he was a “straightforward” man, who had given 45 years of unbroken service to Hong Kong and had no reason to ruin his “glittering” career by accepting a bribe. \nThe prosecution alleged that Tsang had accepted free renovation worth HK$3.35 million on the three-storey luxury penthouse flat in Shenzhen where he planned to retire, in exchange for approving three licence applications from radio station Wave Media. \nWhile considering the applications in the Executive Council, Tsang failed to disclose his private relationship with Wave Media shareholder Bill Wong Cho-bau, with whom he was dealing over the penthouse, the prosecution alleged. \nThe prosecution also alleged Tsang failed to disclose his relationship with acclaimed designer Barrie Ho Chow-lai, whom he nominated for an honour despite Ho working closely with Tsang’s wife Selina Tsang Pou Siu-mei on the refurbishment. \nProsecution lawyer David Perry QC described the conflict of interest as “obvious”. \n“This is in its own league – it’s in the super league,” he told the jury. \nPerry said Tsang had used the awards system as his “personal plaything” and presented a public, churchgoing persona of integrity while secretly exploiting his office for his own gain. \n“It is a story of greed,” he said. “It is a story of an abuse of a public position; the most privileged position you could have in Hong Kong.” \nBut defence lawyer Clare Montgomery QC said the prosecution had encouraged the jury to speculate about what had happened while leaving them in the dark about concrete details. \nThe developer of Tsang’s Shenzhen property normally allowed its prospective clients to have a say in renovation, and there was nothing luxurious about the changes that were made to the flat, Montgomery said. \nTsang’s wife, who had met with designer Ho on many occasions, had only three requests for the apartment’s design: simple, practical and not luxurious. \n“Does that sound to you like the instructions of a corrupt official’s wife? Is that what you say if you’re a greedy couple out for your own benefit?” Montgomery asked rhetorically. \nDuring the trial, Perry repeatedly pointed to Tsang’s secrecy around the apartment as evidence that it was part of a “corrupt bargain”, but Montgomery said Tsang’s desire to keep the property under wraps was motivated by a desire for privacy. \nMontgomery also said there had been no reason for the alleged bribery, as there was every reason to believe the Wave Media applications would be approved. \nTsang’s second in command at the time, former chief secretary Rafael Hui Si-yan, was found guilty of corruption in 2014 and sentenced to five years in prison, in a separate case. He is appealing against the charge. The verdicts \nCharge No 1: accepting an advantage \nThe prosecution alleges Tsang received free renovation work worth HK$3.35 million on a Shenzhen apartment he planned to live in during his retirement in exchange for him approving three applications from radio station Wave Media. \nThe defence says the renovation was necessary because the penthouse was uninhabitable, and that Tsang did not pay for it because he was going to live in the house only temporarily. \nVERDICT: No verdict reached. The jurors could not agree. \nCharge No 2: misconduct in public office \nThe prosecution said Tsang committed misconduct when he took part in discussions about the Wave Media applications but failed to declare his conflict of interest. They said he should have told the Executive Council he was negotiating over a Shenzhen property with a Wave Media shareholder, Bill Wong Cho-bau. \nThe defence said Tsang did not need to declare the connection because it was too distant. \nVERDICT: Guilty. The jurors entered a majority verdict, with eight finding him guilty and one dissenting. \nCharge No 3: misconduct in public office \nTsang was accused of again committing misconduct by failing to declare his connection to interior designer Barrie Ho Chow-lai when nominating him for an award. Ho was the designer behind the HK$3.5 million renovation on the Shenzhen apartment Tsang planned to rent. \nThe defence says the former chief executive did not need to declare the connection, and if he had, it might have put extra pressure on others to approve the nomination. \nVERDICT: Not guilty. The jurors were unanimous. \nWhat happens now? \nTsang faces a possible seven-year jail term and a fine when he is sentenced on count two. The judge has adjourned the case until Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T15:25:09.381+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
