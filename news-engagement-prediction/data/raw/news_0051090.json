REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst \nWASHINGTON  's top homeland security official has signed two orders that could expand the number of undocumented immigrants who could be stopped and deported, according to documents seen by Reuters and first reported by McClatchy news organisation. \nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly included the new orders in two memos signed on Friday, but the memos have yet to be cleared by the White House, two sources told Reuters. \nThe orders were guidance to follow executive orders Trump signed on Jan. 25. \nUnder the orders, hundreds of thousands of people would face expedited removal proceedings, including those previously not prioritised for deportation under former President Barack Obama. \nThose people include those who were charged with but not convicted of crime and parents of children who entered the United States illegally. \nKelly said in one of the memos that illegal immigration across the U.S. border with Mexico had \"created a significant national security vulnerability to the United States.\" \nThe memos also instruct the agencies to recruit police and sheriff deputies to assist immigration agents. \n(Reporting by Julia Edwards Ainsley and Diane Bartz; Editing by Dave Gregorio) Next In World News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:02:30.590+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
