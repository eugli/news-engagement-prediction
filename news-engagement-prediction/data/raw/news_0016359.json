Kaden Hadfield went to hospital 'more than 20 times' but his parents say medics failed to diagnose his condition. Poor Kaden continued to attend school while in agony, some days struggling to walk, others to lift his arms. It was only when he was finally referred to Alder Hey two years after his symptoms began that he was diagnosed and prescribed steroids. By that time the disease had ravaged his body and although treatment seemed to work at first, he sadly died. Mother Caitlin Tattersall, 25, from Bolton, and father Lee Hadfield, 29, of Oldham, are now awaiting an inquest this month, when they finally hope to discover the truth surrounding his death. Meanwhile, the Trust which runs Blackpool Hospital where he was originally treated has confirmed launching a case review into his treatment. Caitlin, who lived in Blackpool at the time after she and Lee separated, said: 'It was heartbreaking, the last time I saw Kaden he was in intensive care, they had his chest open, I could see his heart and lungs. 'They tried to save him for 13 hours. But I don't understand. I feel like if Kaden had just had the medication he needed earlier he would be here today. 'He had been so unwell for so long he never even complained from the pain, but he needed help. I was taking him to school - he was sitting through it and not complaining. Caitlin Tattersall with Kaden pictured at hospital as he struggled with a two year ordeal that started as pain in his ankles Kaden continued to attend school while in agony, some days struggling to walk, others to lift his arms 'It took two years to get Kaden an appointment at Alder Hey, they diagnosed him straight away but it was too late.' The family's ordeal began two years ago, when Kaden woke up one day with pain in one of his ankles, which a GP diagnosed as a sprain. But the pain grew worse, and 18 months ago later when it moved to his other ankle, Caitlin took him to Blackpool Victoria Hospital's A&E. Blood tests showed him to have a vitamin D deficiency and anaemia. In hospital for a week, he was discharged with a bottle of Calpol and Ibuprofen as well as vitamin D and iron tablets. The pain spread to Kaden's knees then all his joints. Referred to Rheumatology at Blackpool, Caitlin claims they gave him more Calpol despite an ultrasound showing tissue damage. Caitlin added: 'It was worse in the morning, he couldn't walk, he couldn't even scratch his own nose his hands were so swollen and stiff. The family's ordeal began two years ago, when Kaden woke up one day with pain in one of his ankles, which a GP diagnosed as a sprain In hospital for a week, he was discharged with a bottle of Calpol and Ibuprofen as well as vitamin D and iron tablets 'We got referred to a physio - the therapist said I was doing too much for Kaden and that's why he wasn't able to do things himself. I felt like I was banging my head against a brick wall.' At Blackpool Hospital, blood tests showed again showed that he was anaemic, despite the iron tablets. Finally, after months of delays, Kaden got an appointment at Alder Hey Hospital, where doctors were so shocked they suspected leukaemia. They diagnosed systemic onset juvenile arthritis and started a course of steroids - which immediately began to ease his pain. But the arthritis was already attacking Kaden's joints and organs and he was placed on a high dependency unit. After six weeks in hospital, he finally turned a corner and his family celebrated with the nurses as he took his first steps in months. But the next day, Kaden complained of a 'stabbing pain' in his stomach and he was taken to intensive care where his heart stopped.
