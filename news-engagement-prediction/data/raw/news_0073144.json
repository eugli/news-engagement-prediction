IndiaToday.in | Written by Samrudhi Ghosh A + A - \nAyesha Takia became the victim of several online trolls after pictures of her suggesting a botched plastic surgery went viral. Her enlarged lips and frozen face led to speculation that she had gone under the knife, and Ayesha seemed to hit out indirectly at her haters through her Instagram posts. Now, the Wanted actor has finally broken her silence on the issue. \nTalking to Indian Express , Ayesha said, \"Online trolling and bullying has reached a new level, I guess. A handful of vicious people and gossip columns have decided to totally morph and distort my pics but the truth will prevail as I'm on social media every day and shooting/out and about. People can see what I really look like and luckily I have amazing followers on Instagram who I interact with daily, so they have not believed these lies and supported me all the way.\" \nMeanwhile, she slammed trolls in yet another Instagram post. Her caption, which talked about not letting bullies bring one down and loving oneself, ended with the hashtag #DontCareAboutFalseRumours.
