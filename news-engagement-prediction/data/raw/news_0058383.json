Yet it was his arched run in the build-up which will have had scouts purring, creeping up on Nicolas Otamendi and then leaving him playing catch up as Fabinho's free-kick looped over the top. All that will have scouts sitting up and taking notice for an 18-year-old who is perhaps the brightest youngster on the continent at the moment. Mbappe kept his composure to fire Monaco in front shortly before half-time on Tuesday night 'When Mbappe was in the line up we knew they were going to attack behind because we defend big spaces,' Pep Guardiola said. In effect, City were frightened in behind and they were right to be. Henry has already been impressed by the striker, who is likely to be linked with all the premier clubs this summer. The Arsenal legend said: 'When I first saw him play against Tottenham in the Europa League, as soon as I saw him, I knew he was a player. I said: 'who is he?' 'At 16, he was asking for the ball, he could dribble, he was having shots, he was winning the ball back and he loved the ball. The 18-year-old celebrates with Radamel Falcao after firing past Willy Caballero at the Etihad 'The desire was there. Mbappe has something special, let's be honest. If he keeps his head on his shoulders, it will come on its own.' Wenger is keeping an eye on him but the price tag is going to be astronomical given he's capable of doing it on the biggest stage - just as Anthony Martial did before him. 'He is not exactly Thierry Henry but it is true that he has similar qualities and the future and talent is similar,' Wenger said. 'The potential is similar, after that if he has the same level of motivation, desire and intelligence that Thierry has, and the next two to three years will tell us that, then he can be very promising. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has compared Mbappe to legendary compatriot Thierry Henry 'The guys that have super talent are already playing at 18. Those who are not playing at 18 or 19 do not have that exceptional talent and he does play over here at the top level. 'He is a guy who is electric like Thierry was, can dribble, can pass and is efficient. 'We follow him, we know him very well, and he is developing well. He extended his contract with Monaco last season and so it's Monaco who are going to decide his future. 'He could be another Thierry Henry.' And if Wenger's saying that, perhaps we should take note.
