We have 38 rifles in our camp in Ajegunle, Ikorodu. \n“My first operation was in Majidun, Ikorodu, and we were seven who went for the operation. Our gang leader, American , was the one who killed the woman (Alli-Balogun) that day. He told us after the operation that he dropped the woman, who was with a man and two children, but the man ran out of the car with one of the children. The woman wanted to speed off when he shot her and abducted her daughter. We kidnapped six persons, including the woman’s two year-old daughter and a ransom of N2m was paid before their release. \n“A few weeks ago, one of the leaders in our camp, Julius, brought the job of the kidnapping of the Turkish schoolgirls and staff members. We didn’t beat them while we negotiated with their relatives because one of the students and the white woman among them assured us that the money we demanded would be paid. When the ransom was paid, I got N2m.” \nThe other suspect, Ayeomi, said his roles were to monitor the camp and cook for the gang. \n“I am a wood logger and was invited to join this camp by my friends. They told me that they were expecting big money. My job was to cook for the kidnappers and their victims. I also got N2m,” he added. \nThe Force Public Relations Officer, Moshood Jimoh, had yet to reply to a text message sent to his phone. \nCopyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.
