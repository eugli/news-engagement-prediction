Representative Seth Frederick Jalosjos (left) and Representative Arnulfo Teves Jr. Photo by Gualberto Laput/Rappler \nDIPOLOG, Philippines – Members of the House Committee on Dangerous Drugs were left aghast by the testimony of Rolly Daligdig, a self-confessed hitman who worked for the police and the City Government of Dipolog. \nDaligdig's testimony pointed to the gravity of the alleged involvement of some policemen in criminal activities. \nDaligdig, now under the Justice Department's Witness Protection Program, told the committee at a hearing on Thursday, February 9, he decided to expose the criminal activities of his police handlers and politicians in Zamboanga del Norte after the killing on November 21 last year of his fellow hitman , Crisanto Gulang, and his live-in partner, Jeanette Acevedo. The two were killed while under the custody of the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA). \nDaligdig, Gulang, and Acevedo worked with Dipolog City's disbanded Team DAVID (Deployment Against Vices in Dipolog), \nDaligdig added Team DAVID was used by Zamboanga del Norte Governor Roberto Y. Uy; his wife, former Dipolog mayor Evelyn T. Uy; their son, former Polanco Municipality mayor Roberto T. Uy Jr.; and police officials in alleged illegal drug trade dealings and the killings of the Uy's political enemies, drug trade rivals, and companions \"who already know too much and talk too much.\" \n\"I'm giving my testimony, before Governor Uy has me killed, for the people and government to know that there is a big syndicate called Team DAVID... which is used to kill and do other illegal activities, including the strafing of the houses and office of lawyers working for the Uys' political rivals and critical media,\" said teary-eyed Daligdig. \nDaligdig added he had already killed at least 12 people by himself. \nRepresentative Seth Frederick Jalosjos asked about the status of the investigation into these killings, to which police officials pointed to each other. Zamboanga Police Senior Superintendent Edwin Wagan said he either did not know or said cases were still under investigation as they could not get witnesses. \nThis prompted Negros Oriental Representative Arnulfo Teves Jr. to accuse Wagan of incompetence. \n\"I'm disappointed with their answers because as police officials, they should know what's happening,\" Teves told Rappler in an interview after the hearing. \nHe stressed that if a policeman is accused of a crime and the investigators are also policemen, there will always be a problem. \nJalosjos also said that other congressmen were shocked, quoting them to have said, \"para namang sine ang nangyari.\" \nAsked if they are saying PNP's internal cleansing is impossible, both Jalosjos and Teves said it is doable but \"a long shot.\" \n\"But we should not dwell on our sorry situation,\" Teves continued, \"we should move on and help the police clean their own ranks.\" \nEarly in December last year, Daligdig and his brother Roger, drug pusher and Team DAVID member Ronald Realiza, and PO2 Armando Viola filed complaints before the Ombudsman against the Uys and 20 other police officials and members of Team David for multiple-murder and other cases. \nLast January 8, Governor Uy was quoted by a local newspaper – Tingog Peninsula – of saying, \"Bakak ug tinumotumo ang mga pasangil aron lang ako ug mga miyembro sa akong pamilya madaut (The accusations were lies and inventions intended to malign me and my family).\" – Rappler.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T02:38:42.931+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
