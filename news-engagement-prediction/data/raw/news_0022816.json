Latest Updates 08:32 AM \nTamil Nadu Governor Vidyasagar Rao is presently in Mumbai. \nIn the wake of uncertainty over Rao's plans, the AIADMK asserted it was the constitutional obligation of the Governor to swear in Sasikala as Chief Minister and that there is no ground for stopping it. \nRao, who is in Mumbai, has no plans to go to Chennai as of now, Raj Bhavan sources in Mumbai said, indicating that he could take a decision today. Rao, who is Maharashtra governor, is holding additional charge of Tamil Nadu. 08:31 AM \nSasikala is meeting several Tamil Nadu ministers at Poes Garden residence in Chennai to chalk out future strategy. 08:31 AM \nIn a dramatic twist former Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam on Tuesday evening revolted against AIADMK general secretary VK Sasikala, saying he was forced to resign as the head of government. \nThe normally quiet and unassuming Man Friday of J Jayalalithaa chose to break his silence on the happenings in the party ever since the death of his mentor on December 5, saying he was being \"insulted\" by senior ministers and leaders who sought to \"undermine\" him after electing him the Chief Minister. \nIn a surprise turn of events on a day when senior AIADMK leader and former Speaker of the state assembly P H Pandian raised the banner of revolt against Sasikala, Panneerselvam made an unexpected visit to Jayalalithaa's 'Samadhi' and sat in meditation for about 40 minutes, creating a flutter in political circles. \n\"I want to reveal some truths to the people of the country and members of the party, Amma's 'aatma' (soul) has urged me to do so,\" Panneerselvam said. \n\"Only a person, who can protect the party and run the government on the principles laid by late J. Jayalalithaa, should come to the helm,\" he said after ending his 40-minute meditation at Jayalalithaa's memorial at night. \nThe AIADMK party removed Panneerselvam as party's Treasurer with immediate effect.
