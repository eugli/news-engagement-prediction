(Netwerk24) Dlamini slammed over grants 'crisis' \nCape Town – Both Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini and Sassa CEO Thokozani Magwaza were absent from Tuesday’s crucial Scopa meeting to discuss the looming social grants crisis. \nMagwaza had been booked off for seven days due to hypertension, department Deputy Director-General Zane Dangor told MPs on the standing committee on public accounts (Scopa). \nHe said Magwaza had applied for leave on Friday evening. An acting CEO would take his place. \nThe Star reported on Tuesday that Magwaza had been suspended. \nMPs criticised Dangor and SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) chief financial officer Tsakeriwa Chauke for Magwaza's absence. \nDA MP Timothy Brauteseth cited The Star report and said Dangor was \"being economical with the truth\". \nIFP MP Mkuleko Hlengwa said the game of \"musical chairs\" was concerning, given that it was on the eve of a crisis. He said the South African public was being taken for a ride. \n'Not a holiday resort' \nANC MP Mnyamezeli Booi said they were used to Sassa officials dodging Parliament, and asked if Dangor would resign on Magwaza's behalf. \nHe said Magwaza had declared publicly in November last year that he would take responsibility for the Sassa social grants crisis. \nSassa and the department were undermining Parliament and not doing their work. \n\"This is not a holiday resort, we repeat it. We are here to do work,\" he said. \nDlamini was expected to host a press briefing as chairperson of the social protection, community and human development cluster in Parliament at 11:00 on Tuesday. \nCommittee chairperson Themba Godi said it was unfortunate that Dlamini had decided not to attend, given the serious nature of the meeting. \nHe said the deadline for the department to find a new service provider to issue grants to 17 million people was April 1, but it was far from being an April Fool's joke.
