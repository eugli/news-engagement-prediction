And some think they’ve found one in her figure. A few of Gaga’s social media followers have pointed out an imperceptible “pot belly” on the singer.\nOne fat-shamer compared her beautiful body to dough. Another said she had “flabby abs,” while a third wrote, “Whoever designed Lady Gaga’s final outfit shouldn’t have let her expose her belly. It wasn’t flattering. #SuperBowl #PepsiHalftime.”\nPicture of lady Gaga's stomach pic.twitter.com/32lQ0U18tk \n— Chaunce the Rapper (@ChonceDeLeon) February 6, 2017 \n\n\nI can see why Lady Gaga was breathing so heavy, her stomach was protesting her #SuperBowl performance. #LULZ #Gaga #LadyGaga @LadyGaga pic.twitter.com/AyzYEMkj2v \n— PoliticsGhost???? (@PoliticsGhost) February 6, 2017 \n\n\nOf course, many fans came to her defense, calling her “pot belly” beautiful, and praising her “normal-person stomach.” One girl thanked the “Born This Way” singer for giving her confidence in her own body.\nFor me, the star of the halftime show was Lady Gaga's normal-person stomach.\n— Rachel Osier Lindley (@RachelOLindley) February 6, 2017 \n\n\nLady Gaga and I have the same stomach and I've never felt more inspired/confident #gaga \n— charlotte (@charzannrose) February 6, 2017 \n\n\nAnother commenter pointed out that this kind of criticism is what causes many women to have body issues.\nGuys making fun of Lady Gaga's \"muffin top\" is the reason why girls have so many body image issues\n— Alexa Morgan (@alexamorgan_) February 6, 2017 \n\n\nThe fact that Lady Gaga is confident in her own skin (enough to perform in basically a bikini in front of millions) is all the more inspiring considering she has struggled with eating disorders in the past.\nAfter being similarly targeted in the past for her weight, she launched a body revolution on her website in order to encourage self-acceptance amongst her fans and others. “Proud at any size, because the inside is what really counts,” she shared on Twitter. “Plus, it’s all how you pose! Just ask the supermodels!”\nFollow us on Facebook , Instagram , and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T00:13:47.612+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
