This process repeats again and again, day and night, every day. With each day, their daughter seems to lose her spark and her personality as brain development slows. \nThis is something that across Australia, thousands of families and people with severe epilepsy are dealing with 24 hours a day. In the clinic, I see many families experiencing this panic, desperately seeking a solution and asking for medicinal cannabis because they have heard it might help. \nHow do I respond to this parent? \nThe issue of safety often gets lost in the debate about medicinal cannabis. I would say to this parent that, while I understand their desperation, the number one principle that I use to guide my decision-making is safety — that is, do no harm. This is even more important when treating children. \nI would say that, even though cannabis is a natural substance, this does not mean that it is safe. Many natural compounds like aspirin, opium, amphetamines can cause great harm but also be beneficial if used appropriately. If we can’t guarantee medicinal cannabis is 100 per cent safe for children, should we be allowing them to use it? (Pic: News Corp) \nCannabidiol — one of the many different cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant — has emerged as a potential new medicine for very sick children with epilepsy. It is showing some promise for a portion of those children who don’t respond well to other medicines. For example, results from GW Pharmaceuticals’ placebo-controlled trials show that one in three children have achieved a significant reduction in seizures. \nTo the desperate parent I would say: “I am not certain that cannabidiol will help your child, in fact, it is most likely that it won’t have a big benefit.” \nWhen I give a child an anticonvulsant drug, such as Tegretol (carbamazepine) for example, I know that it has been around for a long time and has been used in humans for about 50 years. We have information from millions of children and adults with epilepsy showing its risks and its benefits. I know almost everything about the drug before I prescribe it to the child. \nIt is a very different story when it comes to cannabidiol; it has been tried by only about 1000 children worldwide for about two years — so I don’t know what the full short-term and long-term effects might be for a child. I don’t know the risks. The Australian government on Wednesday gave the green light to the legal sale of marijuana products.

I would tell this parent that I would not give such a product to my child. You cannot know what is in it, it may be contaminated with other substances and we know that cannabidiol interacts with other anti-epilepsy medications. \nWhat will support patients and their parents the most, and what we are carefully working towards, is a new, safe, effective medicine — and this takes time and investment. Cannabidiol should be seen as and treated like any other medicine, it is not a miracle drug. We need to know that what is on the bottle is what your child will receive, we need to know that it will be safe to give your child and we need to have clear dosing instructions. I would say that anything less is just not good enough. \nIt is also important to work through all of the options for a child who continues to seize having failed a number of medicines. The most important factor is to be clear on the child’s diagnosis, because some children may benefit from a special epilepsy diet, or epilepsy surgery, or another new medicine that they haven’t had. \nI understand the panic and desperation of these families. That is why we are drawing on research being completed overseas, working through a series of important clinical trials in NSW and also providing access to a pharmaceutical cannabidiol medicine for our most sick children under close medical supervision through a compassionate access scheme. I would assure this parent that we are doing all of this as quickly as we can and in a way that puts the safety of these children front and centre. \nDr John Lawson is leading the paediatric medicinal cannabis trials at the Sydney Children’s Hospital More News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T07:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:17:31.356+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
