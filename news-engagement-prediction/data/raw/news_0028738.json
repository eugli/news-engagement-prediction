The team has yet to announce the roster move. \nCruz, 30, has spent his entire seven-year NFL career in New York after going undrafted out of UMass in 2010. He emerged as a star wideout during the 2011 season by finishing the year with 82 catches for 1,536 yards and nine touchdowns and continued his success on the field in 2012. \nThings took a turn for the worst for Cruz in 2014 when he suffered a torn patellar tendon in his knee and struggled to bounce back. He missed the entire 2015 season after suffering a calf injury while rehabbing his knee and fell into a No. 3 wide receiver role for the Giants this season behind Odell Beckham Jr. and rookie Sterling Shepard, logging just 39 catches for 586 yards and a touchdown.
