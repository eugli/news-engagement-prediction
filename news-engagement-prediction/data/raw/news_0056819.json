However, it was later revealed the station was in fact closed. \nDick said in 2007: “From the behaviors described to me – nervousness, agitation, sending text messages, [using] the telephone, getting on and off the bus – it all added to the picture of someone potentially intent on causing an explosion.” \nDespite ordering officers to stop de Menezes, she claims she never ordered they opened fire on him. \nWhile the Met was found guilty of failings when the incident was taken to trial, Dick was spared any personal blame. \nThe family wrote to London Mayor Sadiq Khan on Friday, warning him Dick would not “command public confidence” if she was given the job. \nBut Khan, a former human rights lawyer, was among those backing Dick’s candidacy, hailing her appointment as “historic.” Keeping Londoners safe is my first priority as Mayor.
