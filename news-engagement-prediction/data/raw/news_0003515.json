When Jonathan Tan was 12, he moved to Canada with his mother, older sister and younger brother because the two boys had struggled with studying Chinese in school. The family had not planned to return to Singapore, and became Canadian citizens in 2005.\n\nWhen Tan failed to register for NS after three registration notices were sent to his Singapore address, a police gazette was raised against him in late 2006. In 2009, Tan’s father - who had remained in Singapore - told the Central Manpower Base of his son’s intention to renounce his Singapore citizenship. But he was blocked from doing so as he had not fulfilled his NS obligations.\n\nBack in Canada, Tan went on to secure a degree in applied sciences, a masters in engineering and a job with a multinational based there. In 2013, he wanted to visit his sick grandfather in Singapore but his mother told him he would be arrested upon return. Tan then began making arrangements to return to his birthplace.\n\nHe arrived in 2015, enlisted in NS the next year and is currently serving his vocation as a preventive medicine technician.\n\nTan’s younger brother Isaac, 25, has also returned to Singapore and is under investigation.\n\n- CNA/kk\nEmail More", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T05:15:10.886+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
