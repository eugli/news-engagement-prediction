For all the talk about Arsenal not having cash to splash the club's net spend is still the third biggest in the land. Season ticket prices are the highest in the world, and there are a lot of fans who have simply had enough of the team's underperformances in crucial European and league matches under the long-serving Frenchman. It was absorbing to watch but a cruel indication of gulf between sides as Bayern won 5-1 Alexis Sanchez looks to the heavens as Arsenal found themselves outclassed by Bayern To blame it all on Laurent Koscielny for being injured last night is not right. Big teams and big players do not simply capitulate because their centre half leaves the field of play. And again we were found wanting. I've had a season ticket since the mid-1980s I've been watching Arsenal play across Europe since 1993. George Graham's teams might have been technically limited but my word what they lacked in skill they made up for in heart, in passion, in a never-say-die attitude and commitment. So to see the team concede those four goals in the second half – albeit against a good Munich side – was an embarrassment that underlined the mental weaknesses the side has as much as being outplayed. And the buck can only stop at one man – Arsene Wenger. His first ten years in charge were full of great – and tough - teams clinching silverware while playing superb football. To blame it all on Laurent Koscielny for being injured last night is not right Arsene Wenger has done a lot for the club, but a new man would be the best way to improve The years following the move from our beloved Highbury saw his teams compete against far richer opponents while we waited for the increased revenue from the Emirates to come on tap. But the fact is we have regressed over the last few years in terms of being able to compete against truly top sides. Hence the criticism Wenger has received from many who believe the sides he's assembled – while being easy on the eye and more than capable of top four finishes to keep the money rolling in – are simply not good enough to challenge the top level of English and European football's elite. And unfortunately, as much as I respect him for what he's done for my club over his two decades, Wednesday's ignominy leaves me with little choice but to believe a new man would be the best way to motivate the team.
