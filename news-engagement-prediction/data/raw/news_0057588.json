(PTI) \nMaharashtra civic election results 2017: Asaduddin Owaisi said that the civic polls were very encouraging for his party, All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Muslimeen (AIMIM). He slammed the Congress for blaming him for dividing ‘secular votes’. “Secular parties should do some introspection and see why are they losing elections after elections to BJP and Shiv Sena. Now the time has come for them to leave their arrogance and do self-introspection. There is no point blaming MIM every time. You (Congress) are losing your vote. You have lost everywhere. Now, it’s the time for them to do reality check, introspection. Show humbleness instead of being arrogant even in defeat,” Owaisi said. \nOwaisi said that his party has went up few steps up the ladder this time and also opened account in the all-important Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). “For us, it has been encouraging because we won eleven seats in Solapur, ten in Amravati, two in Mumbra, three in Mumbai. Nagpur..I am yet to get information. But it has been very good. It has been very encouraging for us. We have opened an account in Mumbai, we have opened an account in Mumbra (in Thane Municipal Corporation),” the Hyderabad Lok Sabha member told PTI. \nYou May Also Like To Watch: \n“We have done very well in Solapur, Amravati. In Akola, we have won two or three seats. So, this is very encouraging, and I thank the people for making our candidates victorious and reposing confidence. Wherever we could not do better, like in Pune we could not open (our account), we will definitely identify our weakness and take it forward”, he said. \nAfter BJP swept the Maharashtra polls on Thursday, he blamed Congress for putting a poor show and said, “”From day one there has been no truth in this obnoxious allegation (that his party splits secular votes). Look at the results. There is definitely something wrong with them (Congress),” he added.
