Abrams With Star Wars Photo Hashtags Jenna Anderson - 02/22/2017 \nThe ending scene of Star Wars : The Force Awakens was a poignant moment for many moviegoers. After the galaxy-shifting events of the film, Rey made her way to a deserted island, where she found an aging Luke Skywalker . He turned around to face her, pulled off his hood, and looked at her, before the film cut to its end credits. \nThis scene was both appreciated and parodied by fans of the longstanding franchise, with some amused and disappointed by the fact that one of the most anticipated characters in the film did not utter a single line of dialogue. And now, Mark Hamill himself has joined in on the joke with a recent tweet. \nThe tweet shows a behind the scenes photo from the scene of Hamill with the film's director, J.J. Abrams . Through the use of a very long and very clever hashtag, Hamill poked fun at his character's silence throughout The Force Awakens. â€” Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) February 22, 2017 \nIn non-hashtag speak, Hamill jokes that Abrams' instructions were to \"slowly turn, remove hood, but don't start your lengthy Oscar-worthy monologue until you get to that rock over there.\" \nHamill often uses social media to poke fun at or troll the growing Star Wars fandom, as was seen with his 'typo or spoiler' tweet regarding Luke's relationship with Finn , played by John Boyega . With that in mind, it's unclear if Hamill will have an \"Oscar-worthy\" monologue in the upcoming sequel The Last Jedi , but fans will just have to wait and see. Star Wars: The Last Jedi , from writer/director Rian Johnson, is in post-production now for a December 15, 2017 release. The film follows-up and continues the story of the next generation of the saga as Rey, Poe, Finn, and Kylo Ren find their place in the galaxy and follow the legacy of Luke Skywalker, Leia, and Han Solo. Daisy Ridley returns to star as Rey, with other returning stars John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, Domhnall Gleeson, Gwendoline Christie, Peter Mayhew, Andy Serkis, Anthony Daniels, Lupita Nyong'o Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa. Benicio Del Toro and Laura Dern join the cast in as-yet-unrevealed roles.
