Valentine's Day is the anniversary of one of the multiple sexual assaults she experienced when she was young, Ikeda says, and in her letter, Quote: : \"After surviving my rape, I spent 10 more years surviving chronic depression and a perpetual feeling that I had to continue to fight for my life. This is my survivor love letter. Don‚Äôt give up on your own happiness.\"\nHappy Valentine's Day from CARE ‚ù§ #survivorloveletter\nA post shared by Campus Assault ResponsE (@careatjmu) on Feb 14, 2017 at 4:29pm PST\nTo invite other survivors to pen their own letters to themselves, Ikeda started a Tumblr for collecting these letters, and the Survivor Love Letter project ‚Äî in which sexual assault survivors across the internet share their messages of self-worth with the hashtag #SurvivorLoveLetter ‚Äî was born.\nToo powerful not to share on this day of love üíó #happyvalentinesday #survivorloveletter\nA post shared by tiffany (@pengpolaruin) on Feb 14, 2017 at 4:21pm PST\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below To spread the word when kicking off the project, she reached out to activist women of color including Suey Park , Lisa Factora-Borchers , Patrisse Cullors , as well as friends who were healing after sexual abuse. The movement has grown in the two years since, and yesterday, the hashtag trended on Twitter as survivors honored their resilience, vulnerability, and healing.\nTo queer & trans survivors: I love you.

We are alchemists traveling back in time & saving our younger selves every day we fight to live. #survivorloveletter\n‚Äî #SurvivorLoveLetter (@taniappleseed) January 11, 2017 To all survivors who feel they're not white/straight/cis/chaste/perfect enough for their stories to matter: I see you. #survivorloveletter\n‚Äî Kamilah Willingham (@kamily) February 14, 2017 \"This year, our current administration exemplifies violence against women, people of color, Muslims, the undocumented and queer,\" Ikeda says. \"When we live in a culture of violence, one of the most radical things we can do is love ourselves.\" It's her hope that #SurvivorLoveLetter will continue to remind survivors to fight for themselves and each other, and motivate others to support them too.\nValentine‚Äôs Day comes with a lot of pressure and expectation about what the day should look like, whether or not you are in a romantic relationship. We have been conditioned to look outside of ourselves for all of the really important things in life, particularly, pure unconditional love. My belief is that until we become our own steady source of love, we will end up in the wrong relationships, constantly looking to someone else to give us all of the things that we have not yet been able to give to ourselves. In ending of this Valentine‚Äôs Day, consider putting your energy into the relationship that you have with yourself, without giving into the false need to rely on any outer circumstance or person to dictate and determine the course of your day. Gift yourself with all of the things that you wish to receive or experience on this or any day. It‚Äôs magical how when we start valuing ourselves fully, the people in our lives naturally start to show up in a different way by also recognizing our worth. Allow yourself to bask in the beautiful brilliance that is you and to treat yourself to all of the greatness that you long for and deserve. Have willingness - Commit to changing up the way you have moved through your relationships in the past. Challenge what hasn‚Äôt worked so far and actively commit to understanding who you need to be to love yourself fully and to attract a partner who can also love you for your authentic self. Forgive yourself - Excuse yourself for all the times that you may have lost a significant piece of yourself to find another. Deeply forgiving past mistakes and misjudgments in your past relationships will help you cultivate an open heart that is ready for new experiences. You deserve happiness. You deserve life. You deserve help. You deserve everything good in this world. And you don't need anyone to tell you or help you get to where you're going. #survivorloveletter #selflove #womensupportingwomen #galentinesday\nA post shared by Jenna Sagvold (@jennasagvold) on Feb 14, 2017 at 7:33pm PST\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below \"I want survivors to know that they sit at the intersection of many experiences and those experiences will help us foster a vision for the world free of violence,\" Ikeda adds. \"Your story has power.
