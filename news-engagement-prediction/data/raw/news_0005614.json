He even said it himself last year: \n\"If I haven’t performed by 2018, I need to leave. It’s pretty simple,” said Kahne in April 2016. “That has nothing to do with William Byron or anyone else. If I haven’t performed by then, it’s time to go do something different. That’s just the way racing and life is.\" \nIt’s do-or-die for Kahne in 2017. Here are five things he needs to accomplish in order to get back on track. NASCAR NASCAR via Getty Images Qualify up front \nLast season, Kahne only qualified in the top-10 on five occasions. Over 36 races, he only accumulated an average start of 16.9. Stats like that are going to make life harder for any driver, no matter how talented they may be. \nIn order to give himself a better shot at finishing up front, Kahne needs to start up there first. Getty Images Getty Images Be consistent \nHere’s a mind-boggling stat for you: Kahne failed to lead a single lap in 2016, a first in his career. \nThat’s unacceptable when you’re in a top-notch ride at Hendrick Motorsports. \nKahne needs to put himself in position to lead laps, and that starts with be able to drive his car to the front on a consistent basis. Getty Images Getty Images Make aggressive moves \nKahne has proven in the past that he can take a lightning fast car and put it in Victory Lane. Unlike drivers like his HMS teammate Jimmie Johnson, though, he’s really struggled to take a top-15 car and get at least a top 10 with it. \nThat is going to be extra important for Kahne this upcoming season. He needs to make aggressive moves to get to the front, even if his car isn’t driving exactly how he’d like. NASCAR via Getty Images Jared C. Tilton Perform better during the summer months \nIn 2016, Kahne failed to finish in the top 10 from the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway in May up until the last regular-season race at Richmond International Raceway in September. \nIf he repeats that same performance in 2017, there’s no way he’s going to survive under the new race format and points system. \nWhen the weather gets hot, Kahne needs to do the same. NASCAR NASCAR via Getty Images Find Victory Lane again \nKahne’s last race win came at Atlanta Motor Speedway in August 2014. That’s over two full seasons without breaking into Victory Lane. \nPlaces like Charlotte Motor Speedway and other 1.5-mile tracks might be his best shot to get a victory, as he is a three-time Coca-Cola 600 winner.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T07:55:51.443+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
