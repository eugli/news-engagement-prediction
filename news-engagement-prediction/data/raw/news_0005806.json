Demar DeRozan and Kyle Lowry (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 4:43 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 4:43 p.m. ET \nThis began as one of the noisiest NFL seasons in memory, in terms of societal and political protest and activism. Colin Kaepernick, remember? It’s ending like all the others normally end — quiet on that front, and pretty much only on that front, as Super Bowl media day unfolded as Super Bowl media day always does. \nThe NFL, in short, was being very much the NFL we’ve gotten to know, even with public dissent taking place up the highway from them at the Houston airport. \nAt the same time, though, the NBA and its people have continued to be who they’ve always been. As Super Bowl week continues, the contrast between the cultures of those sports has never been sharper. \nWhile the Patriots and Falcons players have faced their biggest audience and kept a lid on any talk of the turmoil surrounding new president Donald Trump and his actions — even while many have direct connections to them — NBA people have not hesitated in any way to speak their minds. \nMORE: Sports figures who supported Donald Trump \nDuring the day Monday, Raptors All-Star guard Kyle Lowry pulled no punches when asked about Trump’s executive order enacting a ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries over the weekend. “Absolute bull—,’’ was the gist of it, and he politely declined to clean up the language when he finished. \nThat night, several players at the Super Bowl media event were asked about the ban and about the tumultuous start to his administration. That included Tom Brady , who has been knee-deep in the Trump campaign for more than a year, even while distancing himself as much as anyone can. Falcons receiver Mohamed Sanu, a Muslim, was asked, too. \nThey both passed on the chance to talk. Everybody did, with the mild exception of the Patriots’ Martellus Bennett, who said he would not go to the White House if they won the Super Bowl. \nFor the NFL, that’s akin to standing in front of a tank. \nFor the NBA, that’s akin to asking for lotion in the locker room after the game. \nSUPER BOWL 51: Sanu stiff-arms questions about Trump, travel ban \nThe most passionate statements about the direction the nation has taken have come from NBA coaches, like Gregg Popovich , Steve Kerr and Stan Van Gundy . Kerr and Popovich weighed in on the travel ban last weekend as well. \nPlayers hardly even pay heed to the idea of censoring themselves on social issues, as they proved last summer, when LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul made their ESPYs speech , and when Carmelo Anthony challenged everybody to get much more involved. \nThe group that surged forward in the days and months after Kaepernick began his protests late in the summer? Not so much NFL people, who splintered into factions supporting, condemning and straddling the fence. It was NBA people, with words, gestures and deeds, even when the issues got the most contentious. \nIt’s nothing less than what the public expects from them, the culture that produced them, that they've created and that now surrounds them. \nThe same goes for the NFL, which has continued to look inward, to keep the talk to football and the game at hand. Even at media day at the Super Bowl, when the circus surrounds them and practically everything but football gets discussed. \nMORE: Sudanese born Deng speaks out \nOn that topic, though, they all steered clear. And, in a strange ironic twist, first noticed by the New York Times, the official transcripts of the mass interviews compiled by the league made no mention of any Trump-related questions . (Or, for that matter, any Deflate-gate questions, which at least directly pertain to the game at hand.) \nIronic, because hardly anyone gave a meaningful answer of any kind anyway. \nSo the flame of protest was gently blown out in the league where it was first lit. \nIt ended up catching fire in a much more likely place.
