Editor \nRacism in Singapore I thought was something on the decline. Everyone around me is so kind. Everyone is more and more understanding towards racial equality and racial understanding. But someone people just like to prove that they are the black sheep of the bunch. Posting on social media acting unafraid of consequences. Advertisement \nBeing a Chinese myself, I can't stand this kind of behavior. I have contacted facebook about it but no actions have been taken. Posts with racist comments are all over his facebook. \nMy purpose is to show that racism in Singapore isn't gone and we have to take action when such an injustice is done. Keeping silent isn't helping. \n(yalams is another term for Malays) \nUpDog \nA.S.S.
