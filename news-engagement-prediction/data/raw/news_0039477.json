Though there have been a few Gen 2 Pokemon added in the past few months, the vast majority of the roster is from Gen 1. \nLater this week, users’ wishes will, at last, be fulfilled. Niantic has just announced that the wildly popular mobile game will add 80 new Gold & Silver Pokemon from the Johto compendium. Also, there will be new berry types and trainer accessories. \n“Today is a momentous occasion for our team here at Niantic which has been hard at work to deliver these additional Pokémon and build upon the encounter and capture mechanics for our passionate global community of Trainers playing Pokémon GO ,” says John Hanke, founder and Chief Executive Officer, Niantic, Inc. “ Pokémon GO is a live experience which we’ll be continuing to support and evolve in new and exciting ways for years to come with new gameplay features, in-game and live events, more Pokémon to discover and much more.” \nNiantic goes on to say: “While catching Pokémon, Trainers can use two new Berries—the Nanab Berry, which slows a Pokémon’s movements, and the Pinap Berry, which doubles the amount of Candy received if the next catch attempt succeeds. Trainers will also be able to customize their avatar’s appearance with a new selection of hats, shirts, pants, and other items. Additional items will be available for purchase from the in-game Pokémon GO shop.” \nFor those who are still playing Pokémon GO , this is indeed a nice update. With Spring just around the corner, this update comes at a perfect time since folks will start going (into the scary) outdoors more. The update will go live sometime between now and Saturday so be on the lookout for it.
