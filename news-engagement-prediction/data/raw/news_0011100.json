If it’s something serious enough to disclose, I am sure he will disclose it,” he said. \nHe explained that he could not disclose the nature of health challenge the President is dealing with because he was not aware. \n“The President is the one who can release his own health status. \n“The day he left, we still spoke. He didn’t tell me ‘this is my condition’. He told me he was going to rest and he would do medicals and that was included in the statement we released,” he added. \nAsked if he knew when the President would be returning, Adesina said: “If there was a date he would return, it would have been in that statement. \n“But the issue now is (that) there is no vacuum in government. No lacuna because power has been transferred to the Vice President who is acting president. \n“So, Mr President can take the time he desires and when his doctors give him a clean bill of health, he then can return home.” \nTest Cycle \nPresident Muhammadu Buhari wrote to the National Assembly on Sunday, February 5, 2017, informing of his desire to extend his leave in order to complete and receive the results of a series of tests recommended by his doctors. \nThe President had planned to return to Abuja on Sunday evening, but according to Adesina’s statement, he was “advised to complete the test cycle before returning”. \nThe notice has since been dispatched to the Senate President, and Speaker, House of Representatives. \n“Mr. President expressed his sincere gratitude to Nigerians for their concern, prayers and kind wishes,” Adesina added.
