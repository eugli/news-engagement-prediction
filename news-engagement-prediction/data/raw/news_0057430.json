Today very lucky. Congratulations me. Yay,” he said with his hands up to a question by Wrighton on his win to book a place in the quarterfinals of the tournament. \n“English a little. No problem,” he added. \nWrighton who looked bemused, then asked Oi if he had blown his chances at one point in the match, Oi replies animatedly “I have a pen, I have an apple…Ooo eee..apple pen,” with his hands mimicking the action of a pen entering an apple. \nWrighton who is now laughing to himself says, “I’ve never done anything like this before.” \nBut it doesn’t end there as Wrighton then asks Oi if he could win the tournament. \nOi ponders a little before saying “no problem.” \nUnfortunately though, Oi was knocked out in the quarterfinals. \nWhen quizzed again by Wrighton on his loss, Oi sys “Excuse me, can I speak English..you, me. No English, No problem. Everytime happy,” he says with his hands in the air. \nHe then proceeds with another “apple pen” routine before saying “Oh My God…Thank you. Go. Go home. I go home,” he said looking clearly distressed this time.
