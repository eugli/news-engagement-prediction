Either you like it or you don't like it.' Among attendees at meetings were Islamic extremists Shazib and Junead Khan, who were also arrested for their activities. Last May, delivery driver Junead Khan, 25, was jailed for life for plotting to kill a US soldier in the UK, while his uncle, Shazib Khan, 23, was handed an extended sentence of 13 years for his plans to fight in Syria. Rajib Khan (left) was a member of the group, who had contact with notorious hate preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad (pictured, with Khan, right) The group held meetings in a marquee, which was infiltrated by an undercover policeman Mohammed Choudry, from Maidenhead, Berkshire, was found guilty of encouraging support for ISIS and jailed for four years. Zaiur Rahman, 39, helped to organise the meetings in July 2015 held in a marquee in his back garden and at the Anglican church near his home in Luton. He was convicted of three counts of arranging meetings in support of a banned organisation and jailed for two and a half years. Mohammed Istiak Alamgir, 37, Yousaf Bashir, 36, and Rajib Khan, 38, all from Luton - were convicted of their roles in spreading ISIS ideology. Alamgir got six years, Bashir was handed a four-and-a-half year sentence and Khan was jailed for five years. Istiak Alamgir, Rajib Khan and others with the preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad in the snow during a retreat in Derbyshire sometime before Bakri was excluded from the country in 2005 Mohammed Istiak Alamgir Mohammed Alamgir, a 37-year-old former accountant and father of five, used the name Sayful Islam, meaning Sword of Islam, He has been linked to Anjem Choudary since the late 1990s when their mentor, Omar Bakri Muhammad, nicknamed the Tottenham Ayatollah, established his group al-Muhajiroun on an industrial estate in North London. In one speech at the church, on June 29 2015, Alamgir told his audience: 'We know the Khilafah [Caliphate] has been established, it's going to be the last battle, the great battle, that's going to take place between the believers and the Christians.' He added: 'Obviously we have heard David Cameron say that the terrorists will never come here. They used to say the sun will never set on the British Empire but the sun has set on the British Empire and the sun has started to rise for this Islamic State.' Alamgir was jailed for violence during a sectarian march on the Edgware Road in May 2013. He acted as the group's 'teacher' during lessons at the church hall. When one member of the group asked if he meant fighting physically, Alamgir told him: 'What do you think I'm talking about? Tickling?' 'I'm taking booty now. I'm at war with them, I'm going to take their wealth, I'm going to take their women, I'm going to take their children, I'm going to take everything off them,' he added. Mohammed Choudry Mohammed Sufiyan Choudry, 23, the youngest member of the inner circle, delivered a speech during Ramadan 2015 in which he warned of a 'wave coming' and said non-believers would 'drown in their own rage.' He told his audience: 'I can smell jannah [paradise]' and spoke of 'blood gushing' adding: 'How much are you willing to sacrifice?' In meetings recorded by an undercover officer, Choudry told the audience: 'You go to the streets of London and see some of the things the kuffar doing. Complete and utter disgust.' Choudry told them: 'Imagine tomorrow 40 trucks, were to drive down Oxford Street full of explosives, you tell me who's going to rise, who's going to stand against those people?' Rajib Khan Rajib Khan's relative, Junead Khan, 26, who was present at several of the meetings, hatched a plot to stage a road accident and then execute a US airman outside a base in East Anglia using his father's butcher's knives. Junead Khan was jailed for life last year after the court heard he was planning to leave the country and join ISIS with a third member of the family, Shazib Khan, 24, who was jailed for eight years. The group was also stirred up by the death in July 2015 of one of their members, Rahin Aziz, in a drone attack in Syria after he skipped bail while awaiting trial for a fight at their Islamic book stall on Oxford Street. Khan was prosecuted for encouraging terrorism at Regent's Park Mosque in November 2004 but acquitted. Ziaur Rahman The host of the meetings Ziaur Rahman, 39, was convicted of arranging the meetings held in a marquee in his back garden and the local church. Rahman had been fined for protests against returning soldiers from the Royal Anglian Regiment in March 2009. Yousaf Bashir Yousaf Bashir, 36, showed the undercover officer images of the execution of Syrian soldiers by 20 members of the youth division of ISIS. Convicted for offences over protests against returning soldiers from the Royal Anglian Regiment in March 2009 and a sectarian march on the Edgware Road in May 2013.
