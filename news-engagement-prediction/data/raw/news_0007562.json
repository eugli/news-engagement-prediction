He said the work was only half done as the overall estimate of the sludge — a combination of oil, marine debris and water — was pegged at 116 tonne.

MP Maple had offloaded its LPG consignment on the port and was leaving when it collided with MT Dawn Kanchipuram that was coming into the port, loaded with petrol and lubricants. \n“Both the ships have been detained and secured at Kamarajar Port and inquiry is on,” said Kamarajar Port chairman cum managing director MA Bhaskarachar. The captains and crew have also been detained. The clean-up could continue for another two days, said an official. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:20:31.319+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
