In fact, while the D3400 costs a little bit more (though prices are continuing to fall), the D3300 is the better buy right now. \nDespite the growing popularity of mirrorless cameras, the entry-level DSLR market is still incredibly popular for those looking to take the next step in their photography journey. \nNikon's range of D3xxx models has proved incredibly popular over the years for new users looking to expand their creativity thanks to their blend of easy handling and solid performance, backed-up by an impressive range of lenses and accessories. Features 3.0-inch screen, 921,000 dots 1080p video capture \nThe D3300 features a high resolution 24.2MP APS-C sensor - pretty impressive when you consider the enthusiast-focused D7200 shares the same resolution and costs quite a bit more. \nLike the rest of the range, the D3300's sensor does away with the low-pass filter, which should mean even more detail is captured, resulting in even sharper images compared to previous models like the D3200 . Non-low-pass filters explained \nIn addition to this, the native sensitivity range runs from ISO100 to 12,800, and there's an expansion setting that takes it to the equivalent of ISO25,600, providing plenty of flexibility for a range of lighting situations. \nLike the Nikon D5300 , the D3300 sports Nikon's now second-generation processing engine, the EXPEED 4, allowing the D3300 to shoot continuously at a maximum rate of 5fps, while it can sustain this burst rate for up to 100 fine quality JPEGs. More than enough for most people's needs. \nThe EXPEED 4 processing engine is also responsible for allowing the D3300 to record Full HD movie footage at framerates up to 50p/60p and with continuous autofocus. Helpfully, there's a microphone port as well as a built-in stereo mic for better sound recording during movie shooting. \nThere are a host of Special Effects on tap, allowing you to jazz-up JPEG files and videos with a collection of styles. Nikon has boosted the list of effects to 13 for the D3300, and it now includes Pop, which increases colour saturation, Toy Camera, which creates a retro effect, and Easy Panorama. These effects can be previewed in real time on the LCD screen, so you can see exactly what you'll get once you trigger the shutter. \nThe D3300 has a dedicated 420-pixel RGB sensor to gather exposure, white balance and focus information to inform the Automatic Scene Recognition system. Meanwhile, there's an 11-point AF system that we've seen on a host of previous models, which has a central cross-type AF point for extra sensitivity. \nIt's a little unremarkable, especially when compared to some mirrorless rivals , but its a tried and test system. \nFinally, although the D3300 uses the same battery as the D3200, we are told that the new processing engine allows the camera to be more efficient in its power consumption, and the battery is claimed to last for around 700 shots – we'll be keen to put that claim to the test during our review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:19:36.975+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
