On Feb. 19, Ellen revealed on her Facebook page that after a promising week, her daughter’s health was not in good shape and she was on several antibiotics to treat what the doctors thought was a blood infection/sepsis. She was undergoing treatment at Vanderbilt Children’s Hospital in Nashville. We thank all of you for your prayers.
