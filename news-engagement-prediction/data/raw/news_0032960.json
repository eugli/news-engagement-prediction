In the border state of Texas, children of immigrants followed suit with their own event. \nHigh school seniors in Austin, Texas, made a Facebook chat about the national “Day Without Immigrants” protest and decided to organize a peaceful march in solidarity. \nA common chant throughout the march's mile-long journey from city hall to the state Capitol was \"el pueblo unido jamás será vencido,\" which roughly translates to \"the people united will never be defeated\" in English. \nLisbeth Soto, one of the organizers and a senior at Austin’s Anderson high school, said she’s not surprised the march became popular so quickly since social media helps things go viral. She does, however, hope the protests across the country remain peaceful and goal-focused. \n“We wanted a peaceful protest because we’re here to prove that we want to stay here, that we deserve to stay here,” Soto told the Daily Dot. “We decided to come here and bring American flags instead of other countries’ flags because, if we want to stay here, we should show that we are appreciative of being here in this country.” Lizbeth Soto (organizer), unknown, Zaira Garcia-Gutierrez (organizer) Photo by Audrey Browning \nSoto, who was born in the U.S., said fear from her undocumented family and friends about the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Austin made her want to stand up for the silenced. \nTexas state Sen. Sylvia Garcia (D-Houston) echoed a similar belief and hopes this tactic inspires both social and legislative change at the city, state, and federal levels. \n“It's good to see people stand up for themselves and demand recognition of the many contributions they make,” Garcia told the Dot via email. “I applaud their nonviolent response to a hateful climate. Where there is hate, let us spread love.” \nMany other participants expressed similar inspirations and backgrounds, usually alluding to the Trump administration’s policies and opinions on immigration. \n“[My mom] crossed the border at 12 years old and almost died. People don’t understand how hard it is,” said July Jasper, a protester and senior at Austin’s Manor High School. “I’m here for a future. We have dreams. We will not be stopped.” Yulisa Maldonado, Angel Bravo, July Jasper, all seniors at Manor High School Photo by Audrey Browning \nAustin’s march wasn’t alone. People gathered in other cities across the country, and some showed their solidarity on social media. Immigrants lead over 70 Fortune 500 companies & are about 25% of US Nobel laureates. They strengthen our communities. #DayWithoutImmigrants — Amy Klobuchar (@amyklobuchar) February 16, 2017 Shoutout to the people who came here with empty pockets and dreams, and worked their asses off to make a living. #DayWithoutImmigrants ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T05:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T04:41:39.167+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
