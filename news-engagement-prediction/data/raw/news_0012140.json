Riding recklessly on their 'kapcai', they cause noise pollution and are a menace to other road users. StarMetro checks out a few popular spots these hell riders reign supreme. \nPERSIARAN Raja Muda Musa in Klang is a busy road during weekdays as many use it to get to the Federal Highway and other highways. \nHowever, after midnight on Fridays and Saturdays it becomes an illegal race track with hundreds of Mat Rempit gathering to race against each other. \nMost of them modified their motorcycles to go fast and give a louder “vroom” sound. \nSome of the bolder members of the group even do the wheelie, ride without holding the handle or lie on their stomach. \nThe usual meeting spot are from the U-turn under a flyover at Taman Gembira, Klang and the traffic light junction leading to Jalan Sungai Keladi and Jalan Kastam just before Port Klang town. \nThere is also a shorter route from the Pandamaran Sports Complex to the Jalan Sungai Keladi and Jalan Kastam traffic lights. \nOnce the race starts, there is no adherence to traffic rules and traffic lights and whoever stands in their way runs the risk of getting abused or attacked by the Mat Rempit . \nThe race usually starts and finishes at the same spot. \nNot only do they ride fast and recklessly, the Mat Rempit also get furious if other road users get in their way. \nThey would often harass or bully them by surrounding the lone vehicle as if to say, “Get out of the way, this is our road!” \nAllan Lim, 36, who was returning late after attending an event on a Saturday last month, said a group of bikers weaved across his vehicle at the Federal Highway as though telling him to get out of the way. \n“It is scary when these bikers come so close to your car and criss-cross dangerously. An accident can easily happen. \n“They have no regard for their safety and for other motorists,” he said. \nA motorists, identified only as Wong, said when he drove towards Taman Tun Dr Ismail, Kuala Lumpur about 3am, a group of Mat Rempit prevented other vehicles from passing by, blocking all the four lanes. \nWong tried to overtake them but was blocked by about 40 bikers. \n“I was shocked that one of the bikers sprayed my front windscreen with a fire extinguisher. \n“I had no choice but to stop my vehicle in the middle of the road as I could not see the road. \n“After the bikers left, I washed off the foam with water,” he said, swearing to avoid the Mat Rempit after that incident. \nThese Mat Rempit also cause sleepless nights for those living in shoplots and flats along Persiaran Raja Muda Musa when they race which is normally a noisy affair. \nA flat dweller along the Federal Highway in Shah Alam, known only as James, said he and his family had to endure sleepless nights during the weekends because of the Mat Rempit menace. \n“The loud sound from the motorbikes when they race during the wee hours of the morning disrupts our peace,” added James. \nThe Mat Rempit also have spectators who come with their own kapcai , some with female pillion riders, gathering at Jalan Kim Chuan and Kampung Raja Uda in Port Klang. \nThese spectators, who gather in big numbers, have no qualms blocking the roads, to get a good view of the illegal race. \nBased on StarMetro’s observation, these Mat Rempit would initially offer the spectators a “trailer” or “warm-up” races just after midnight to allow bets to be placed. \nThe real deal or actual races takes place between 3am and 6am. \nThese races are repeated and the winner is decided on the number of times a rider comes out tops. \nBesides Klang, Bandar Setia Alam and the stretch between Batu Tiga and Padang Jawa along the Federal Highway where the notorious Mat Rempit race. \nAt Setia Alam, the race starts along Persiaran Setia Alam which connects Jalan Meru to the toll booth leading to the New Klang Valley Expressway. \nOn Saturday, about 30 Mat Rempit gathered at the Jalan Glenmarie traffic light junction leading to the Batu Tiga flyover on the Federal Highway just after midnight on Saturday. \nIt started under the flyover, heading for the Padang Jawa interchange where the racers made a U-turn and headed back to where they started. \nThe illegal races went on until 4am. \nSome of them would head to nearby petrol stations for a break before resuming the race. \nTo avoid detection by the authorities, the racers often used heavily tinted visors on their helmets. \nThe Mat Rempit mostly in their 20s and early 30s, enjoy performing stunts and dangerous manoeuvres to the delight of onlookers. \nMotorists want the police to take action against the Mat Rempit saying that they have gone overboard. \nAttempts to obtain comments from the police on actions taken to reduce the Mat Rempit menace was unsuccessful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T01:22:17.777+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
