We failed to achieve that last year but we are working hard to do that this year.” \nHe added that he was not going to give any number or calling names of those he believe would be among the top 10, but he said his expectation will be to see more than one breaking into the top ten. He further revealed that the athletes will be in Lagos before February 9 to train and also get acclimatised to Lagos weather. \nPhillibus Sharubutu was the best male Nigeria at the first edition of the marathon while Oluwaseun Olamide was the best female, although both failed to break into the overall top 10.
