Title contenders, European hopefuls and relegation battlers alike all scrambled to improve their squads ahead of Tuesday night's deadline, with mixed results. Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the winners and losers at the end of another month of madness. Antonio Conte has every reason to be cheerful after overseeing an impressive January window West Ham lost star man Dimitri Payet at the end of a long-running transfer saga WINNERS Chelsea Forget Moussa Dembele, which was always a long shot, the champions-in-waiting can only feel a little angst at not bringing Dembele’s Celtic teammate, Craig Gordon, to west London. A backup goalkeeper. More importantly they kept Diego Costa, in what felt like a defining moment of Antonio Conte’s regime, raked in £6m for Patrick Bamford (who has never played for the club), stole £52m for Oscar and waved goodbye to John Obi Mikel and Branislav Ivanovic. Plenty of FFP room for the summer, which is ominous. Chelsea managed to keep hold of leading scorer Diego Costa amid interest during the window Everton While we are on the subject of clearing out the deadwood, ruthless Ronald Koeman has overseen a Goodison Park exodus. Out went Darron Gibson and Brian Oviedo, for a David Moyes reunion at Sunderland (more of that later) while few of the Gwladys Street faithful will be upset at the loan departures of Oumar Niasse, Gerard Deulofeu and Tom Cleverley. If Morgan Schneiderlin can forget Manchester United ever happened he could be a great addition, while Ademola Lookman’s impressive cameo against City hints at a big future. Morgan Schneiderlin's arrival at Everton is a significant addition to Ronald Koeman's midfield Crystal Palace Remember when everyone said that Alan Pardew had a wonderful squad and Palace were set to take the Premier League by storm this year? The first thing Sam Allardyce did when he arrived at Selhurst Park (it may have even been before he installed his trusty printer and changed the WiFi name) was demand investment. It duly arrived in the shape of Patrick van Aanholt, Jeffrey Schlupp, Luka Milivojevic and, finally, Mamadou Sakho. Allardyce wants clean sheets. He should get them. Sam Allardyce has made significant additions at Crystal Palace, including Mamadou Sakho West Ham Did well to get £25m for Dmitri Payet who has been a sulking shadow of the man he was last year. Robert Snodgrass could excel in his new surroundings and Jose Fonte should add a commanding presence at the back that the Hammers have lacked in their new home. Despite losing Payet, West Ham did good business in January as they brought in Jose Fonte Burnley James Anderson is not the only Burnley Express. Sean Dyche’s Clarets roll on - and end the window in ninth place with safety almost certainly secured. The manager may well tell us there is no value in the market but the additions of Robbie Brady and Ashley Westwood suggest otherwise. The return of Joey Barton, after his brief stint with Rangers, already looks like a masterstroke. All aboard, destination survival. Burnley made a big splash during the January window with the addition of Robbie Brady LOSERS Sunderland David Moyes may make a laughing stock of us all if the pulls this one off. Selling Patrick van Aanholt, one of few positives on Wearside, made room for reunions with Darron Gibson and Brian Oviedo. Add that pair to Joleon Lescott and few pulses have been set racing. They kept Jermain Defoe, which was vital, but a late failure to land support in the shape of Leonardo Ulloa left a pending sense of doom in a season of gloom. Sunderland's biggest January success was keeping hold of Jermain Defoe, but was it enough? Middlesbrough It is never a good sign when your manager starts calling out your chairman in public. When that chairman is Steve Gibson, arguably one of the best in the country, it does you no favours. Aitor Karanka’s very public disclosure that Boro failed to land his top targets could open the door for his exit. A departure from the Premier League may also be on the cards. Manager Aitor Karanka has been left in a difficult position following his recent comments Liverpool & Manchester City Hard to split these two. Both need players, both have cash but both could not identify anyone that was a) an improvement and b) available. Seasons that promised much (and still may deliver) look set to end in disappointment and a lack of activity in January, while probably wise in the long run, will have disappointed supporters. Managers Pep Guardiola (left) and Jurgen Klopp (right) had frustrating transfer windows Hull City A reluctant inclusion, this one. The general consensus is that they have had a nightmare. I am not so sure. Robert Snodgrass is a big loss and Jake Livermore will be another miss. If we have seen anything from new boss Marco Silva, however, it is that he appears to know what he is doing. While the eight new faces, a mix of loans and permanents, may seem underwhelming, it would not surprise me if the new man proves everyone wrong and lead the Tigers to a miraculous safety. Hull's creative force, Robert Snodgrass, departed to club to join West Ham during January Great Britain It was rubbish, wasn’t it? We cling to January windows gone by in the hope that something big will happen. A Luis Suarez moment, even a Fernando Torres would do. The best thing about this January’s lifeless market was that we had actual football to keep us occupied on deadline day night. Sky need to send their reporters back into the crowds and their inflatables (and other implements) – at least we could be sure of some entertainment then.
