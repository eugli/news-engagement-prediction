(Photo: PavelHlystov, Getty Images/iStockphoto) \nThis is the story of a cat, a crisis, a cop and — in the end — something that took me by surprise. \nIt all started the other night when I pulled into the driveway and saw a plump orange and white cat. It looked into the headlights, then dashed across the yard and onto a neighbor’s front porch, where it stood expectantly, waiting, it seemed, to be let in. \nPoor cold kitty, I thought, as I knocked on Elyse’s door to tell her that her cat — so friendly, as it wove itself around my ankles, and brushed against my legs — had somehow gotten outside. \nExcept it wasn’t her cat. \nWhich was a problem. \nLet me stop right here to say that I hadn’t been feeling so hot that day — I was tired and cold and I had a headache from not sleeping well the night before. I was also upset and frightened and dispirited by executive orders and political nastiness and words, all those words, I never thought I’d hear coming from the mouth of our nation’s leader. \nI was overwhelmed by a sense of doom. \nRelated: \nThat night I just wanted to go indoors, put on my pajamas, pour a glass of wine, sit in the dark and decompress. \nAnd yet, the cat. \nI couldn’t leave it outside to fend for itself on a cold winter night — or any night, for that matter. It wasn’t wearing a collar, but it was so social, I knew it had to be someone’s pet. I knew that someone somewhere cared for it. \nThen, a thought: I decided kitty might belong to the lady across the street. I knew she had cats and I was pretty sure one was orange, though I’d never seen it. So while Elyse kept an eye on kitty, I banged on the lady’s front door. No luck; she wasn’t home. \nNext, we went to Tara’s house. She’s the organizer of the block, the person who knows everyone and, we thought, would surely know how to reach the woman I’d decided must be the kitty’s owner. \nTara texted our absent neighbor and left a voice mail, too, though she was pretty certain the cat didn’t belong to her. \nIt started snowing harder. \nThat’s when when we decided to catch the cat — which was now hiding in a tangle of brush in yet another neighbor’s yard — and put it in a crate. We crawled under the brush, raised the curiosity of people walking to their cars from a nearby restaurant, and used Meow Mix as a lure. \nSuccess! We managed to coax kitty into the carrier. \nBut, then, another problem: What to do with kitty? The three of us all have pets who don’t take well to strangers. Tara called a neighbor couple to see if they could house the cat overnight, but they couldn’t because of allergies. \nSo we did what any people with a stray cat in a cage would do: We called the police. \nI have to say, I didn’t really expect anyone to show up, but sure enough, within a couple of minutes, a police car arrived. The officer said he knew someone on one of the next streets over that had lost a cat. He said he was going to swing by that house to find out if kitty belonged there. \nA few minutes later, as my neighbors and I chatted on the sidewalk, the officer pulled up in front of us again — and told us he’d found the cat’s home. \nI was amazed. \nAnd not just because the cat got driven home by a cop, the way I imagined a kid who broke curfew might be put in the back of a police car and driven home to his or her parents. \nI was amazed because on a really awful day when the news was full of divisiveness and distrust and when I’d been teary over all of it, everything somehow worked out. We’d caught the cat. The cop had driven it home. We’d done the right thing. We’d made something good happen. \nAnd that, I was surprised to realize, somehow made me feel less doomed. \nIn fact, it made me feel oddly hopeful.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T02:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T03:06:37.271+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
