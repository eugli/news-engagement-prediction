As the NFL ’s commissioner, Goodell runs a league that touts parity like Subway touts $5 footlongs. But the truth is, a league that values balance has been overtaken by one team. \nThe NFL has its own version of the Galactic Empire. The Patriots have captured seven of 16 AFC crowns since 2001. They’ve won five Super Bowls. Despite dealing with the ramifications of that death sentence (the loss of a first-round pick, a million bucks, and Tom Brady for four games), they were the best team in football this past season. The NFL -- the rebel alliance in this analogy -- mounted its biggest boldest attack against the Empire. And it failed, getting slashed to bits by Darth Vader. \nBut that’s not even the craziest part about the Patriots’ latest championship. The craziest part about their Super Bowl isn’t the fact that they overcame a 25-point deficit in the second half to defeat the Atlanta Falcons . It’s not that they did it with a 39-year-old quarterback. It doesn’t relate to any of the players or the plays they made on the field -- including Julian Edelman’s miraculous catch. \nIt’s that they won without Rob Gronkowski . \nEarlier this week, Ryan Wilson argued why the Pittsburgh Steelers should be considered the favorites in the AFC. Will Brinson then presented his case for the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC. This is a look at why the Patriots should still be viewed as the favorites in the AFC. \nIt starts with Gronk. \nConsider this: The Patriots won the Super Bowl after a 14-2 regular season in which Gronk -- easily their best playmaker -- appeared in eight games because of multiple injuries. He didn’t make an appearance in the playoffs. \nNow that team is going to be adding the most explosive tight end in NFL history back to its roster this offseason -- a tight end who averages 0.77 touchdowns and roughly 69 yards (nice) per game in his career, a tight end who did this when he was healthy this past season: GRONK. — NFL (@NFL) October 9, 2016 \nTranslation: The Patriots might be impossible to beat with Gronk back. He’s their version of the Death Star. And based on some recent video evidence, the battle station is nearly operational. \nBut the Patriots’ case as the favorites in the AFC doesn’t end with Gronk. Let’s take a look at a few more reasons … Tom Brady isn’t slowing down \n“I have the answers to the test now,” Brady said. \n“You can’t surprise me on defense. I’ve seen it all. I’ve processed 261 games, I’ve played them all. It’s an incredibly hard sport, but because the processes are right and are in place, for anyone with experience in their job, it’s not as hard as it used to be. There was a time when quarterbacking was really hard for me because you didn’t know what to do. Now I really know what to do, I don’t want to stop now. This is when it’s really enjoyable to go out.” Brady says he has the answers now. Be afraid. USATSI \nOK, I lied. That’s not scary -- that’s terrifying. Brady might not be able to stop the process of aging, but he’s rendering that process insignificant. Brady remains the greatest quarterback in the game and he’s not slowing down. \nIn a 12-game regular season, Brady still nearly won MVP, finishing second to Matt Ryan . He lost one game. He set an NFL record for the best touchdown-to-interception ratio by throwing 28 touchdowns and only two interceptions. And remember, he did that all largely without Gronk. There’s no reason to think Brady is going to decline beginning in the fall. \nReally, the only argument against Brady is the downfall of Peyton Manning . At 39, Manning turned into a worse version of Brock Osweiler after experiencing another stellar season at 38. There wasn’t really an adjustment period. Manning hit the wall, and the wall rendered him ineffective. According the anti-Brady crowd, Brady will be next. \nThere’s two big differences between the two. For one, Brady is better than Manning. And Brady isn’t dealing with significant back issues. Before his final season, Manning admitted that he couldn’t feel anything in his fingertips. Brady doesn’t have that issue. He’s completely healthy -- thanks to his strict and insane diet , a stable offensive line, and an offensive system built around quick passes. Brady, unlike Manning, is built to last into his 40s. \nThat doesn’t mean he’s going to play forever. At some point, he won’t be Brady anymore. Even Vader died in the end. But barring a significant injury, Brady’s demise likely won’t happen next season. Coaching staff continuity \nBill Belichick is still Bill Belichick. He’s still the coach who celebrated the Patriots’ championship by leading a “No days off!” chant at the parade and complaining about being behind in his preparation for the 2017 season. I don’t need to spend any time arguing why Belichick gives the Patriots the best chance at reaching another Super Bowl. By now, that’s as much of a fact as saying water is wet or we’re all going to die some day (except Brady, of course). Belichick’s keeping the band together in 2017. USATSI \nHere’s what’s important for next season: The Patriots didn’t lose any of their highly-prized and sought-after assistants. After interviewing with multiple teams , offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels decided now wasn’t the right time to take on a head coaching gig , and nobody hired defensive coordinator Matt Patricia -- also known as the coach who stepped off the plane in Boston wearing a Goodell clown shirt. \nSuccessful teams, as Belichick knows so well, often deal with the loss of key assistants. Somehow, that didn’t happen to the Patriots after a Super Bowl season. \nRetaining both coaches boosts the Patriots’ chances next season -- not that Belichick couldn’t have overcome their losses if he had to -- because continuity matters. More draft ammunition \nFunnily enough -- OK, it’s not at all funny -- Deflategate isn’t over. It lives on, because the Patriots are still dealing with the ramifications. This year, a year after forfeiting their first-round pick, they won’t have their fourth-round pick. But that’s OK. The Patriots are about to receive some draft ammunition. \nJimmy Garoppolo , who played one-and-a-half games while filling in for Brady at the beginning of the season, likely will be traded this offseason to a quarterback-needy and (this is the key word) desperate team. CBS Sports NFL Insider Jason La Canfora has more on the timing of the trade: \nRegardless, I would hardly be writing off the likelihood of a Garoppolo trade just yet, though I would also caution that with New England in no rush to have to deal him, and the Pats with oodles of cap space and Garoppolo costing them next to nothing, I wouldn’t get fixated on the timing of this deal. It hardly has to be completed by the start of the league year in March, though I would certainly bet on it coming to fruition before the draft is complete in late April. \nObviously, it’s impossible to know what the eventual trade will look like, but the reported price tag is a first-round pick , which would be the most Patriots thing ever considering Garoppolo has thrown 94 career passes. Even if the Patriots don’t snag that first-rounder, they’re likely to land at least one second-rounder. So, they’re going to be in a position to select another player who can contribute during yet another championship run. \nWhich bring us to Malcolm Mitchell . The emergence of Mitchell \nThe Patriots drafted him in the fourth round last year. He played in 16 games, including the postseason. \nCheck out how he improved over the course of the season: \nCatches", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T20:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T16:33:10.519+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
