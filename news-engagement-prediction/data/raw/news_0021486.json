He's in bed.\" \n\"You think he's dead?,\" asks the operator. \nFadi replied \"yes\" and goes on to give the address of George's house in Goring, Oxfordshire.

He's blue.\" \nHe also says he's \"very stiff\". \nThe operator asks if he's \"beyond help\" and Fadi repeats that he's \"dead\". \nFadi then says: \"I've been trying to wake him up for the last hour but it's not possible. He's gone. He's blue.

I've been waiting for him to wake up for hours and he wouldn't so I went to wake him up and he was gone. He's not there.\" \nFadi is asked if resuscitation would be affected, but repeats that he's \"cold, stiff and blue\". \nHe is then told not to move or disturb the body until the death is verified. \nWhen she asks for the patient's name, Fadi says: \"It's George Michael, you know, the singer.\" \nAfter a postmortem failed to establish the cause of George's death, the detectives from Thames Valley police arranged to interview Fadi at a mews house. \nFadi has been under intense speculation about his relationship with George following his claim that he spent the night sleeping in his car on Christmas Eve. George's death is not being treated as suspicious (Photo: Getty) \nIt is understood the decision was taken not to release the body because the first post-mortem proved to be inconclusive. As yet, no funeral has been organised, the MailOnline reported. \nSenior coroner for Oxfordshire, Darren Salter, has yet to open an inquest into the pop star's death on Christmas Day and Thames Valley Police have said they were still awaiting the results of toxicology tests on his body organs to ascertain if drug ingestion had played a factor in the singer's death. \nSpeculation has mounted that the 53-year-old, who was known to have used crack cocaine and heroin in the past, may have turned to narcotics in his final days. \nPolice said the death was still being treated as \"non-suspicious\" although interviews have been carried out in the weeks since.
