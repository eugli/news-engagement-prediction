Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nArsene Wenger’s future is far from certain, while star players Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil could also be heading for the exit door and fans are unlikely to be consoled by the fact the only firm plans that appear to be in place concern the new kits. \nThe first ‘leaked’ pictures on next season’s strips began appearing on social media on Wednesday and were hardly met with universal approval.
