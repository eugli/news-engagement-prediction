It was listed in November 2014 for $8.7 million, then the price was dramatically cut to $4.9 million in June 2016. If those fluctuations weren’t enough, the Italian Renaissance–style mansion first hit the market in 2012 for $9.5 million. Entryway with staircase\nrealtor.com \nThe home was originally commissioned by local brew master Joseph Theurer , and in 1896 architect Richard Schmidt built the home on spec. The trend, which we’re used to seeing in the megamansions of Southern California, was mostly unheard of over a century ago. \n“William Wrigley Jr. came by and bought it in 1911,” says listing agent Anthony Disano , of ParkVue Realty Corp. ’s Chicago office. “It’s unclear how many years he lived there.” \nWrigley Jr. died during the 1930s, but the home remained in the Wrigley family until the 1980s, according to DNA Info . \nAll the original woodwork, tile work, and brass in the 13,705-square-foot home are still intact and in good condition. Baroque-style terra cotta was sourced from the same supplier as The Wrigley Building , in downtown Chicago. \nThe home also has a rare copper patina roof, a solarium, a wine cellar, a top-floor ballroom, and a library. There’s exquisite bird’s-eye maple, mahogany, and cherry woods throughout, including on the staircase. \nFor fans of city living who don’t want to give up living space, this is a rare opportunity: “You don’t get that (much) square footage in that neighborhood,” says Disano. A guesthouse and two-car garage (once a horse stable) are also on the property. One of the home’s nine baths\nrealtor.com A top-floor ballroom perfect for charity galas\nrealtor.com \nThe agent thinks it could serve as home base for a local magnate. “It’s well-fit for a family,” says Disano. “Even though it’s large—the grand entrance is humongous—the square footage is taken up with the staircase.” The next owner will need to update the kitchen and bath, which were last renovated 20 years ago. \nOne plus for a discerning buyer? The mansion was unused for years, which may mean less wear and tear to the structure. \n“Why did they keep this property so long and not use it much?” muses Disano. He has no answer to that rhetorical flourish, but he adds that the home has had no more than five owners. It’s now waiting for the sixth to unwrap the next chapter in its history.
