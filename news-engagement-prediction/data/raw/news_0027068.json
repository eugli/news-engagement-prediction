Once we get people off public assistance, we don't supply them with a needed benefit.\" \nA volunteer with advocacy group Riders Alliance, Norma Ginez, spoke alongside Jones about her struggles as an unemployed single mother of three girls. \n\"I want to start searching for a job, but after expenses, I can't afford [to],\" she said. \"Sometimes I have to choose between MetroCards and buying a snack for my girls.\" \nJones was one of several people at the rally and the hearing who criticized the city's plans to subsidize ferry service and create a $2.5 billion BQX streetcar for riders with \"a lot of money to pay for two fares.\" \nCouncil members and public speakers pushed for the city to foot the bill for the subsidies, but a mayoral spokeswoman said the burden should be Gov. Andrew Cuomo's. \n\"The proposal is a noble one, but it would create a substantial financial burden for New York City. As New Yorkers know, the MTA is the responsibility of the state. They should consider covering the cost,\" City Hall spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said. \nGoldstein noted the city already provides nearly $1 billion annually in direct subsidies and an additional $4.3 billion in indirect annual subsidies to support the MTA, and last year committed an unprecedented $2.5 billion toward the agency's capital plan. \nCuomo's office directed inquiries to the MTA, which has repeatedly said the city should foot the bill. \n“The MTA always tries to keep fares as low as possible and still provide safe, reliable service. The MTA already makes a substantial commitment to low-income City riders, including $625 million annually MTA spends to subsidize services primarily available for NYC-only residents (such as elderly, paratransit and schoolchildren),\" said MTA spokeswoman Beth de Falco Monday. \nAt the last MTA board meeting, former chairman Tom Prendergast said that \"social services are rightly the role of municipalities in caring for their residents\" and not the role of the MTA. \nThe finger-pointing comes amid a New York Daily News report that Cuomo's recent budget proposal includes cuts to MTA funding. \nAfter the hearing, Jones expressed frustration with the city and state's back-and-forth. \n\"If [the city] wants to shift the cost to the state, have they made a demand? I don’t think they have, other than as a throwaway [comment]. Why not start a negotiation?\" Jones said. \"You can’t just toss off and say, 'Oh, the state should do it.' You have to make a demand, and let them say no.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:20:16.051+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
