Isaac Ross, 40, a Singapore permanent resident, to stop molesting the victim. He apologised to her. This was in January 2016. \nRoss, the court heard, had begun touching and hugging her inappropriately at various locations in the flat shortly after she started work on Nov 28, 2015. \nShe did not like what he was doing and always rejected the Malaysian. \nSometime after Jan 10, he told her that he wanted her by the end of the month. He later apologised to her after the agent warned him. \nBut on March 7, he told her to apply medicated oil on his lower back, using a roller. She got worried and told his wife, who brought her to make a police report two days later . \nOn the same day, the maid was tidying the children's bedroom when Ross entered the room and kissed her on the right cheek. She pushed him away and told him he could not kiss her because she was his maid. \nHe apologised and left the room. \nTwo days later, the victim was in the children's room when he came and hugged her from the front. He then used his hands to squeeze her breasts. \nShe pushed him away. Ross then asked whether she wanted to see his private parts, and she said no. She told him not to behave this way and left the room. \nSeeking a sentence of 12 to 14 months and three strokes of the cane, Deputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling said Ross wasted no time in embarking on a campaign of sexual harassment against the victim when she started working in his household. He continued to harass her within a span of four days in January. \n\"This was clearly not a once-off spur of the moment situation, but a sustained period of offending which would likely have continued were it not for the victim's initiative in taking steps to report this matter to her agent and the accused's wife,\" she said. \nShe also said he abused his position of authority against his domestic helper. \nRoss, a senior security specialist, was sentenced to 11 months' jail and three strokes of the cane on Monday (Feb 27) after he had admitted to two of four charges of molestation. \nHe could have been jailed for up to three years, fined, caned or received any combined punishment for each count of outrage of modesty. â€“ The Straits Times/Asia News Network \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T13:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T08:47:05.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
