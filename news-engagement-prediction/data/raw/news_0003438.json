Trump told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published on January 13 that he had received a “beautiful” holiday card from “the chairman”. This came after the two men were confirmed to have spoken by phone in mid-November after Trump was elected earlier that month.\nWill Trump’s hard line on US trade with China mean the end of business as usual?\nShi Yinhong, director of American Studies at Beijing’s Renmin University, said Trump was deliberately giving the Chinese leader a cold shoulder” by calling all other major world leaders but not the Chinese president. “Trump’s isolation of Xi implies he wants to show he has the upper hand in the distribution of world power,” Shi said.\nShi believed the move underlined the uncertainties that have beset Sino-US ties following Trump’s election, but he expected the new leader to address his relationship with China soon after the controversy surrounding his immigration ban subsided.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T02:05:30.240+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
