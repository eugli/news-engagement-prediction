Dead or alive, the one thing the Asset could not be allowed to do was break cover.\" But, as diligent, committed, and hardworking as LG’s security goons might be, the company’s upcoming flagship, the LG G6, does appear to have broken cover, both literally and figuratively. Pictures of a purported prototype of this new Android smartphone have leaked to Droid Life , and they show a device in a state of distress. The G6’s rear is shorn of its top left corner, exposed at its midriff, and punctured by two curious holes on its side. Droid Life Much of what these images show, we already know . The G5’s modular design is being ditched, the front is almost all screen, and there’s a headphone jack, dual cameras, and a fingerprint sensor in roughly the same spot as last year’s model. But now we get a better idea of what those things will actually look like. The rear cover of this supposed LG G6 prototype should probably be disregarded — it looks more like a placeholder filling the space before the fancier, more premium back is applied. A person familiar with LG’s plans has told The Verge that the company is aiming for an all metal and glass design, which the rough-hewn material pictured here would not be in sync with. Stay tuned for more on the G6 as we build up to it final unveiling at Mobile World Congress on February 26th — LG phones can never resist hitting the limelight before their proper launch, and the G6 seems to be extending that tradition.
