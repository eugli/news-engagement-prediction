Matt Gaetz filed a bill that would terminate the Environmental Protection Agency if passed. (Steve Cannon/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   10:45 PM \nA proposed bill from a Florida lawmaker would make good on Donald Trump's campaign promise to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency as it faces crippling cutbacks under the new administration. \nThe radical legislation submitted by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fl.) on Friday would dissolve the 47-year-old agency tasked with protecting the nation's air, land and water with a $8 billion budget. The agency's future and former President Obama's climate change mandate is doubly uncertain as President Trump's pick to lead the department, Scott Pruitt, has garnered a reputation for waging legal wars against environmental conservation with more than a dozen lawsuits. \nIn the first week after Trump took office, the White House gagged the EPA’s communications and froze its grants and contracts. \nIt's believed that once appointed, the Oklahoma Attorney General will immobilize some of the EPA's regulation authority on carbon dioxide pollution. Scott Pruitt is slated to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) \nTrump first proposed scrapping the EPA during a February 2016 debate and vowed to leave it to the states to set their own environmental agenda. \n\"Environmental protection — we waste all of this money,” Trump said. “We’re going to bring that back to the states.” \nJust how Gaetz's bill intends to demolish the agency is uncertain. The legislation's text remains a mystery as it enters congressional committee. President Donald Trump first proposed getting rid of the EPA during a 2016 presidential debate.

Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Rep. Steven Palazzo (R-Ms.) and Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.).
