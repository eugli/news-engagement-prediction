This is beyond vandalism,\" Detective Shawn Thrush told The Philadelphia Inquirer . \"It's beyond belief.\" \nThe attack comes nearly a week after authorities in St. Louis said vandals there damaged 154 headstones at a suburban Jewish cemetery. Last Wednesday, after Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens called for volunteers to assist in the cleanup of the Chesed Shel Emeth Society Cemetery, more than 1,000 people, including Vice President Mike Pence, showed up to help clean up . \nPence, who was in the area to give a speech at a business in Fenton, Mo., said of the damage, “There is no place in America for hatred or acts of prejudice or violence or anti-Semitism.” \nMuslim groups raised nearly $75,000 to help the Missouri cemetery, the Associated Press reported. \nPhiladelphia police on Sunday said they were alerted to the vandalism at Mount Carmel Cemetery in the city’s Wissinoming section just after 9:30 a.m. WPVI-TV reported that a man visiting his father’s grave came upon the damage and alerted police. \n\"It's just very disheartening that such a thing would take place,\" Aaron Mallin said of discovering the damage. \nMallin said he hoped the vandalism wasn’t an anti-Semitic attack. \n\"I'm hoping it was maybe just some drunk kids,” he said. “But the fact that there's so many, it leads one to think it could have been targeted.\" \nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf called the vandalism \"a cowardly, disturbing act,\" adding: \"We must find those responsible and hold accountable.\" \nThe Jewish Federation of Greater Philadelphia said it would begin accepting donations at its website, jewishphilly.org , on Sunday to raise money for repairs. \nReacting to the vandalism, The Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect tweeted simply: \"WE ARE SICKENED, SICKENED, SICKENED.\" \nFollow Greg Toppo on Twitter: @gtoppo Police estimate 75-100 headstones toppled at Mount Carmel Jewish cemetery in Philly. pic.twitter.com/CrxtfGv2cd — Stephanie Farr (@FarFarrAway) February 26, 2017 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2mt0bV4 NEVER MISS OUT The Short List Let us bring the headlines to you every night.
