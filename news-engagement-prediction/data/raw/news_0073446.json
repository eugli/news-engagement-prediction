I've always liked Chris, so this makes me happy. The title alone makes me intrigued. Chris is a fighter - an embodiment of a hero. It will be interesting to see what kind of story Capcom gives him this time around. I love when developers give back to the fans with free DLC post launch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T01:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T04:11:02.554+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
