But within the team, we know each other and we knew we were ready to win. \n“Maybe outside, people saw it differently. I think most people were thinking that Chelsea could be top four but not champions. \n“Now, though, we are top of the league, so we just want to stay there. We are motivated by being in a good position, but also because last season was very bad. \n“So we want to be there again, to be at the top again, for the fans. This is why we are top now.” Related videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T01:03:18.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
