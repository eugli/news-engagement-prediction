Step number one: \"Don't use his name.\" \nSpeaking at a New York City gala for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy group that awarded her the National Ally for Equality Award, the actress served the president without so much as uttering his title. \nAnd yes, she directly addressed the tweets Trump leveled at her following her Golden Globes speech, saying \"I am the most overrated, overdecorated and, currently, I am the most over-berated actress ... of my generation,\" she said. \nStreep also spoke about the reality of being a target, since her original anti-Trump speech, including from what she called \"brownshirts,\" a reference to the Nazi group. \"It's terrifying to put the target on your forehead. And it sets you up for all sorts of attacks and armies of brownshirts and bots and worse, and the only way you can do it is if you feel you have to. You have to! You don't have an option. You have to.\" \nThe acclaimed actress also gave thanks to her gay and transgender \"teachers, colleagues and friends,\" ending the award speech by saying that as far as we've come, there's more work to do. \n\"We should not be surprised that fundamentalists, of every stripe, are exercised and fuming. We should not be surprised that these profound changes come at a steeper cost than we originally thought. We should not be surprised that not everyone is actually cool with it,\" she said. \n\"All of us have the human right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. If you think people were mad when they thought the government was coming after their guns, wait until you see when they try to take away our happiness.\" ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T07:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:22:33.517+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
