Big Fights Lambi SAD boss and Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal faces former Congress CM and Patiala royal Capt Amarinder Singh and AAP's Jarnail Singh in his pocket borough. One of the tallest leaders of the Sikhs, the senior Badal is fighting to retain his hold on the community as well. \"Capt\" is no stranger to big ticket battles and had defeated the BJP's Arun Jaitley from Amritsar in 2014 Lok Sabha polls. He is also contesting from his Patiala home turf. Jalalabad Deputy CM, Sukhbir Badal is also the party president. If SAD returns, Badal junior can take the credit. He faces some tough contenders in the fight â€” AAP's Bhagwant Mann and Congress's Ravneet Singh Bittu (grandson of slain Chief minister Beant Singh). 6. Hot Seats Amritsar east Navjot Singh Sidhu assertively sought to play a bigger role in state politics and quit the BJP to join the Congress ahead of the polls, saying he was a \"born Congressman\". His wife was BJP's sitting MLA on this seat before both joined the Congress. Sidhu was the party's main crowdpuller in Majha. Majitha Bikram Singh Majithia runs SAD alongside brother-in-law Sukhbir Badal. The powerful but controversial figure has won from this seat in 2007 and 2012, notching the second highest margin of votes, almost 50,000 votes. 7. Make or Break While he's not in the fray himself, Arvind Kejriwal 's AAP is fighting the 'outsider' label and troubles in the state unit. Nevertheless, his party won four of the 13 Lok Sabha seats here in 2014 and Punjab is a good bet for AAP to shed its tag of being a Delhi party.
