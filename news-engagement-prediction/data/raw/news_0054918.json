That includes current Baltimore Orioles star Manny Machado. As CSN Philly recently brought up , Machado's eventual free agency makes 2017 something of a make-or-break year for current third baseman Maikel Franco. \nHere's why the speculation is warranted and Machado could eventually be the next big thing at Citizens Bank Park. \n-Franco is far from a sure thing. \nFor as promising as Franco was as a rookie (130 OPS+) in 2015, last season represented a huge step back (96 OPS+) in offensive production. Plus, despite passing the eye test for many fans, Franco's defense (minus-6 runs saved, negative defensive WAR) rated below average last season. \nAmong third basemen with at least 350 plate appearances in 2016, Franco's 1.2 WAR ranked 27 of 29. Franco has upside, but he was one of the worst players at his position last season. \n-Andy MacPhail, Matt Klentak drafted Machado in Baltimore. \nThis is important. The relationship between MacPhail and Klentak goes back to their days running the Orioles. In 2009, armed with the third pick in the draft, the duo selected Machado. The pick set Baltimore up to become one of baseball's best teams over the last five years. \n-Machado is worth a record-setting contract, and the O's aren't poised to pay it. \nMake no mistake: Machado is going to get headline-worthy money. A deal in excess of $350M (if not over $400M) is possible, if not likely. The crazy part? Machado will be worth it. \nOver the last two years, Machado's 13.7 WAR ranks fourth among all big league position players. According to Fangraphs , he's been worth $106.1M over the last two years, and $169.3M from his age 20-23 seasons. Machado will hit free agency after his age-25 season--meaning his prime and pre-decline years are still to come. \nWe're talking about a special player off to a ridiculous career start. Yet, the Orioles reportedly haven't made a legitimate attempt to keep him long term. \nPhillies predictions \n-Better investment than Bryce Harper? \nAs Bryce Harper free agency rumors swirled during the offeason, the Phillies came up as a logical destination . \nBut Machado could be seen as a better long-term investment for Philadelphia. Last season, Machado topped Harper in the following categories: WAR, OPS, HR, OPS+, total bases and extra-base hits. \nPlus, with Philadelphia's slew of outfield options (Dylan Cozens, Cornelius Randolph, Nick Williams, Mickey Moniak ) in the system, Machado may make more sense as a long-term answer at third base. \nJoe Giglio may be reached at .
