Fowler (I’m allowed to say that, it’s my column!). Managers make ruthless calls. I’ll hold my hand up, I’ve been there, and it is a horrible, horrible situation. \nYou believe in your own mind you’re still doing it, still better than ever. I always believed no one was better than me and I should be playing. \nThat’s why I always moan I should have had more England caps, because I passionately believe I deserved them. \nBut, at Liverpool, I was in a situation similar to the one I believe Aguero now finds himself in at City. The manager has brought in another striker and, for whatever reason, has decided to go with him.

As much as you want to see the team doing well, you want to see it doing well with you in it. You don’t want to be sat there watching someone else start scoring the goals. \nIt’s the worst feeling in the world and I’ve totally been there. Gerard Houllier started to drop me at Liverpool and it absolutely drove me wild. \nI did things I’m not proud of now, just because I was so angry and so emotional about being dropped, because I was always desperate to play (sorry about the angry voice messages, Gerard!). \nWhat made it worse for me was the fact that Houllier was the sort of manager you couldn’t go to speak to and ask why. Robbie Fowler celebrates after scoring (Photo: Allsport) Fowler and Houllier during their time with Liverpool (Photo: Getty) \nAs a manager, if someone came to see me to ask why they weren’t playing, I’d tell them straight. Tell them someone was doing a better job. \nHe wasn’t like that, he used to bristle and say it was ­disrespectful to your team-mates to even consider asking the question – and that caused me all sorts of problems. \nBy all accounts, Pep Guardiola doesn’t much like the direct approach, either, but whether Aguero feels he should be dropped or not doesn’t matter. \nIf you sit down and analyse it, you are always dropped for a reason. That reason is nearly always because the manager believes you’re not pulling your weight for the team, or someone else can pull more.

Guardiola wants to play a high press, and he wants to play a lone striker. That means the striker doing a helluva lot of running, but his stats have dropped every year since he arrived at City. \nThis year, Guardiola has got him covering more ground than last season, but he still doesn’t run anywhere near as far as the lone strikers from the two other top teams who play a pressing game in the Premier League, Spurs and Liverpool. \nHarry Kane and Roberto Firmino run about one to two kilometres more per game. They also do more tackling, more interceptions and create more chances for others too. \nThat doesn’t matter so much if you’re scoring the goals, but his strike rate is down on what it was last year, and the year before. And the year before that. \nWhen he doesn’t score, City have a major problem. It happens. You get older.
