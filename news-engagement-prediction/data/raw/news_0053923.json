The first season of \" A Series of Unfortunate Events ,\" a Netflix show based on a children's book series of the same name, was filmed in Vancouver over the spring and summer.\nWhen not acting as the series' main villain Count Olaf, Harris was spotted across British Columbia, occasionally with his family in tow. He took in the Vancouver Pride Parade, hiked the Stawamus Chief and spent his 12th anniversary with husband David Burtka on the beach in Tofino.\n \n  Can't stop thinking about our #Tofino adventure. Thanks to the amazing Wickaninnish Inn (say that five times fast!) for creating a property that allows for such lasting memories. The lovely staff, delicious food, unique excursions, and brilliant views - we really drank the Kool-Aid (which, being Canada, is beer). Can't wait to visit again and bring the entire family! @wickinnbc @dbelicious \nA post shared by Neil Patrick Harris (@nph) on Apr 5, 2016 at 4:11pm PDT \n \nHarris has publicly professed his love of B.C., and praised Vancouver as a \"fantastic city\" in an article published in the New York Times last month .\n\"Also, since the city is on the coast, there is great seafood, and I ate amazing sushi and oysters,\" he said in the article.\nIn the interview, he said he took advantage of how \"health-conscious\" and \"family-friendly\" Vancouver is. He said he'd biked through Stanley Park, and took his twins to the Vancouver Aquarium and the science centre.\nHe also took his family up the Grouse Mountain gondola, watched a lumberjack show and \"took in the spectacular views.\"\n \n  Vancouver is awesome. Took the family up to Grouse Mountain, rode a gondola, saw a lumberjack show and took in the spectacular views. And rested in carved trees. #ohcanada \nA post shared by Neil Patrick Harris (@nph) on Jun 29, 2016 at 6:52am PDT", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:54:11.404+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
