Above all‚ never ever try to be smart in anyway.\" \nUrsula Candasamy pointed out that it would result in a hefty telephone bill for taxpayers. “That phone call is going to cost South Africans fortunes.” \nOne user used the opportunity to poke fun at Orlando Pirates and their six goal loss. \nKevin Ramsamy said that “Zuma and Trump should discuss Orlando Pirates and the 6 problem”. \nItumeleng Terry Chipa said‚ “Let's do what Pirates fans did and cut off the cellphone cables‚ they might be plotting something against South Africa”. \nBilly Warner mentioned that the Guptas may be hired by the American president. Zuma would be an appropriate person to vouch for them: “Trump wants a character reference for the Guptas”. \nLucky Nxumalo was short and to the point‚ calling on both presidents to resign. \nRoger Wells proposed: “They SHOULD talk about AGOA and chicken imports ... they probably WILL talk about pulling the wool over their countries' citizens' eyes... and how to stay in office when the electorate turns against them.” Share  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T16:00:18.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
