The game’s downloadable expansion, Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City , is also available. Like all of Xbox One’s backward-compatible titles, players who already owned the game digitally on the Xbox 360 will find it ready to install on their Xbox One consoles, while disk owners can access the game by simply putting their game disc into the Xbox One. Original save files can be accessed from an Xbox 360 by transferring them to the Xbox’s “cloud saved games” folder. And for those who don’t already own a copy, GTA IV is available for digital purchase on the Xbox Store for $19.99.
