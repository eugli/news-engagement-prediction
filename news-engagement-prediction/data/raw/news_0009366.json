Girls Pose for Powerful Recreation of ‘Hidden Figures’ Poster Kaitlin Stanford \nEditor’s Note: Babble participates in affiliate commission programs, including with Amazon, which means that we receive a share of revenue from purchases you make from the links on this page. \nSince its wide release earlier this month, the film Hidden Figures has racked up several award nominations, earned impressive box office sales, and touched the hearts of millions. And once you see it, you’ll immediately know why. \nThe film, which is based on a book by the same name , tells the inspiring true stories of three African-American women working at NASA during the early ’60s: Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, and Mary Jackson. Each one, in their own way, plays an integral role in helping the first American shuttle launch into space, despite their many hurdles simply because they’re women of color. \nAll three women broke barriers; yet all three — until now — were forgotten by history. \nThe film stars Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe (to name a few), and while its main focus is the behind-the-scenes story of NASA’s first orbit, it also highlights the tense realities of race relations of the time. Yet above all, it’s a story about feminism and the fierceness of three smart women, determined to have the careers — and the lives — they know they’re capable of. \nBy the looks of things, it’s already inspiring little girls to dream big. \nEarlier this week, the film’s star, Taraji P. Henson, took to Instagram to share an image of three young fans who had seen the movie and dressed as the main characters. “I do what I do #SoTheBabiesCanDream,” wrote Henson in her caption. Needless to say, an outpouring of emotion came from her 9.8 million Instagram fans. \n“Damn this gave me chills,” wrote one Instagram user. \n“Hidden figures no more,” wrote another.

As Ambrielle-Baker’s mom Jerrica Rogers told HuffPo, it was all part of a recent project assigned by their teacher Terrance Sims at their school, Milwaukee College Prep. \n“His goal is to create a series of posters that positively affirm the excellence of his students in addition to the other students in the school,” Rogers explained. But it’s also to “shine light on the beauty of African-American culture in preparation for Black History Month.” \nAnd it certainly does. \n“It is a beautiful thing to see three talented black women lead such an inspiring true story,” Rogers shared. “We do so much for our kids in the community, and it is just refreshing to have media and entertainment sources that further the development of our youth.” \nThere’s no doubt that the girls left the film inspired — according to Rogers, they loved it so much that they saw it twice, and now have “lifelong memories as well as role models to look to.” \nConsidering only 29% women make up the STEM field — and recent studies have even proven that girls as young as 5 believe men are smarter than women — a film like Hidden Figures probably couldn’t come at a better time. \nHere’s hoping the next generation of girls can look to this story, and others to come, to show them how capable they truly are — of working on cures for cancer, running tech firms, and yes, even launching rockets into space.
