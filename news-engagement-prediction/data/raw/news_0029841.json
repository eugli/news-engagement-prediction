We want to question the status quo and of course, we expect a fight back by interest that will be trampled upon. \n“We are going to be as sincere as possible in the direction we are going. We are going to be as flexible as humanly possible. We are not promising hitch free examination. \n“We envisaged that there will be hitches here and there, but they will not be insurmountable. Rather than promising the nation hitch free examination, we will be promising a direction we will all be pleased with. \n“Initially there might be hiccups and of course one would not have been appointed if it is routine. I believe that I have been given a very difficult job and that is why I am not promising that all will be smooth.” \nHe argued that that was why JAMB invited stakeholders to critique its processes, because it would not want to continue in the wrong direction. \nHe said, “We are creating some ICT facilities and we want our stakeholders, prospective candidates, respected scholars, institutions, civil societies to come together and critique what we are doing, so that we can be sure, before we go too far in a wrong direction. \n“This is a view of harvesting good ideas that could improve what we are doing.” \nHe said the CBT had come to stay, as four African countries had indicated interest to come over to Nigeria to understudy it. \n“Of course, I believed that Nigeria is ripe for this (CBT). Nigeria is more advanced than some of these countries. At least, we have three or four countries that are observing our examination and they want to go the way of the conduct of the examination,”he said. \nWhile he said the JAMB would soon commence the sale of its forms for the 2017 UTME, he added that the examination body was also working on the possibility of conducting a mock examination “for some people who just want to try on what we are doing.” adekunle", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T17:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T13:29:13.952+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
