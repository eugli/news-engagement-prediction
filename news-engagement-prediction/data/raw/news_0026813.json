The news follows on the complementary announcement of a movie in development about Wershe. It is a wild tale that also touches on serious issues in the criminal justice system, like the idea of incarcerating a juvenile for life on the basis of non-violent crimes. \nWhite Boy Rick (which was Wershe's drug dealing nickname) will tell Wershe’s story in 1980s Detroit — the height of the crack epidemic — as he became an undercover police informant as a teen, a youthful drug-dealing prodigy, a 14-year-old FBI informant and then a prisoner with a life sentence when his handlers abandoned him. \nWershe, 47, has been in jail since the late 1980s, nearly 30 years, for non-violent crimes he committed as a juvenile. The book will take the story up to the present as Wershe has sought parole. (He even went before the board Tuesday ). Journalist Scott M. Burnstein, who has spent considerable time with Wershe, will co-write the book. \nThe movie and book are separate but complementary projects that have the blessing of each other. The book is Wershe’s chance to tell his story in his own words. \nStudio 8 is developing the movie which has already cast Matthew McConaughey as Ewrshe’s father, Bruce Dern as his grandfather, Bel Powley as his sister and Jennifer Jason Leigh and Rory Cochrane as FBI agents who worked with Rick. \nJon Silk overseeing production for Studio 8 and John Lesher, Julie Yorn, Darren Aronofsky and Scott Franklin producing. Yann Demange directing. The movie is described as a less a crime story than a father-son tale set against the backdrop of poverty and the crack epidemic. \nJessica Regel at Foundry Literary + Media represented Wershe. Matthew Daddona acquired the book for Dey Street. Andy Lewis", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T04:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:44:05.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
