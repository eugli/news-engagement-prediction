The reason that Swedes are talking about Nils Bildt is not about what he is saying, but instead that he is not the Swedish Defense and National Security Advisor as Fox labeled him. How did Bildt end up on the Fox News O’Reilly Factor as a false expert? \nOn the O’Reilly Factor , Bill first spoke to Ann Sofie Naslund from Expressen who stated that the issues with immigrants are not about safety, but about social issues such as schooling.

Metro inquired with the Swedish Embassy and they did not know who he was. He is not a Swedish Defense and National Security advisor. There were questions about the accountability of Fox News for so blatantly misleading viewers with a man whose name is not Nils Bildt?

He is really Nils Tolling, according to Johan Wiktorin, Nils Bildt is his alias. Intelligence and Security Advisor, the CEO of Brqthrough, Chair of SCIP Nordic-Baltic, Wiktorin is not too impressed with Fox News on who they claim is their Swedish National Security expert. \n“So @FoxNews This is Nils G Tolling and he’s not known in our circles as an expert. Not on National Security anyway.” So @FoxNews This is Nils G Tolling and he's not known in our circles as an expert. Not on National Security anyway. pic.twitter.com/2MVu85mhWr \n— Johan Wiktorin (@forsvarsakerhet) February 24, 2017 \nAccording to SVD , Nils Bildt does not even live in Sweden. Bildt emigrated from Sweden in 1994 and grew up in Westport, CT, and now runs a security company in the United States. He has a Master of Arts, International Policy. He changed his last name from Tolling to Bildt in 2003. \nAccording to Swedish paper Aftonbladet , Bildt spent a year in jail after being convicted in 2014 by Arlington District court, of being guilty of violence towards a civil servant. In court, Bildt even threatened the victim. His character took a hit with the court comment of “He has no self-control.” \nIn addition, there appears to be a Wikileaks file on Tolling. \n“Now the Trump admin is resorting to putting fake plants on Fox. Ladies and gentlemen meet right wing spook Nils Tolling.” \nOn Friday, Metro did reach Nils Bildt, who responded by email that he is an independent analyst and Fox News chose to mislead their viewers by labeling him a “Swedish Defense and National Security Advisor.” \n“I participated in Bill O’Reilly’s program on Fox News, it was Fox News editor who used the title – I myself had no control over their choice of title. I am an independent analyst based in the United States. I hope this clarifies the matter. “ \nOn the other hand, why would Fox News put someone on Bill O’Reilly’s show if he did not have some authority to speak intelligently and accurately on this matter? \nWhat do you think about Fox News’ source? Do you think that Fox News should be more careful to be accurate about the people they put on their programs? \n[Featured Image by Ilya S.
