When his team faced mighty Premier League power Arsenal in the fifth round of the FA Cup, and lost 2-0, he casually munched on a meat pie on the bench after the third substitution was made, ruling him out of an appearance.\nThe magic of the FA Cup. pic.twitter.com/voaWJMN24U\n— amadí ???? (@amadoit__) February 20, 2017\nThings, as ever in modern soccer, appear to have been a bit more complicated than that. It turns out that SunBets, the betting arm of the notorious Sun tabloid, which had bought jersey sponsorship for Sutton on its day in the — *cough* — sun, offered a bet that Shaw would indeed eat a pie during the game.\nThen he did. And the bookie paid out what it claims was a five-figure sum to bettors.\nCOST US A BELLY FULL: We've paid out a five-figure sum after @WayneShaw70 finishes his pie with glory! #YouBetcha #FACup pic.twitter.com/XrBCL3psOZ\n— Sun Bets (@SunBets) February 20, 2017\nShaw, nicknamed the “Roly Poly Goalie” by his own teammates, was fully aware of the odds on him snacking on the typical English soccer stadium fare and was glad to oblige. He even conceded to the Daily Mail that he’d done it because of the bet. Shaw even went as far as to admit that he knew “a few of the mates” had bet on it at the 8-1 odds.\nAs such, he has apparently run afoul of betting laws in English soccer precluding active players from gambling on the sport. The Football Association has opened an investigation. Shaw, who also served as a kind of odd-jobs man at the club, was asked by Sutton to resign, which he did.\nYou know what? Shaw is still a hero.\nAnd on his way out, he wants you to know that it was actually a pasty, not a pie. Because that’s what a hero does: set the record straight on his own heroism.\nGreat journey well done to all the management players and staff go again Saturday proud to be involved @suttonunited it was a pasty not pie.\n— Wayne Shaw (@wayneshaw70) February 21, 2017\nAnd the story has a happy ending for Shaw. Morrisons, an English grocery store chain, has offered him a job as a “pie taster.” The chain told The Independent that it’s “always looking for the best talent” and was “really impressed by [Shaw’s] commitment to pie eating.”", "external_links": ["http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/sutton-united-goalkeeper-wayne-shaw-eats-pie-bet-stun-morrisons-arsenal-betting-a7591326.html&quot;", "https://twitter.com/wayneshaw70", "https://t.co/voaWJMN24U", "https://twitter.com/suttonunited", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/FACup?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/YouBetcha?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/amadoit__/status/833793698685186048", "https://twitter.com/SunBets/status/833797353010262016", "https://twitter.com/wayneshaw70/status/834010097655410688", "http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/fa-league-cups/sutton-united-goalkeeper-wayne-shaw-eats-pie-bet-stun-morrisons-arsenal-betting-a7591326.html", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vFdIrxnTDlmBLSpEVhIZ6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/041c16b20f384527d909a9ac1e2b7b8b", "https://t.co/XrBCL3psOZ"], "published": "2017-02-22T04:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:50:16.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
