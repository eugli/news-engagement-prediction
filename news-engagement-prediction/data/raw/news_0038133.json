With the increase in life expectancy and willingness for an early retirement, one is expected to have at least 25 years of life post retirement. Moreover, post-retirement healthcare tends to consume a large share of expenses given the inflating healthcare cost. \n\nRetirement planning is essentially managing the finances post-retirement for both self and your spouse, assuming that the children are well-settled and married by then. Prime importance should be given to financial independence, self-reliance and respect after retirement. \n\nFirst question arises – when should you start planning for your retirement? Anytime is right time to start retirement planning, but a rider follows, the later you start your planning, the more will you have to save on a monthly basis for meeting the same standard of living post retirement. So logically, the earlier you start, the better it is for you. The sooner you get started, the greater are the chances of reaching your retirement goals because compound interest can work its magic. \n\nAs retirement planning involves understanding of various asset classes, one should take help of expert or financial advisors to design the same. \n\nThe magic of compounding \n\nTo quote Einstein, “Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world . He, who understands it, earns it, he who doesn't, pays it.” \n\nTo put it in layman’s language – compound interest can turn a negligible small fund invested regularly into a monumental fortune . \n\nAbove is the example of the difference between Rs 1 lakh invested for 20 years on a) simple interest at 10 per cent per annum and b) compound interest at 10 per cent per annum. At the end of 20 years, the amount invested on simple interest would yield Rs 3 lakh while the investment made on compound interest rate would give Rs 6.72 lakh i.e. more than double. Only two virtues are required in addition to the invested sum viz., long-term projection and patience. \n\nStarting early is very important. If you start early, your money gets more time to grow. For example, if you start investing Rs 5,000 a month at the age of 20, earn compounding interest of 12 per cent and you end up with fortune of Rs 5.93 crore when you retire at 60. But if you start at 30, the sum accumulated at 60 would be just Rs 1.75 crore. \n\nDisciplined investment is a must \n\nIt is virtually impossible for an average investor to make one-time investment that would take care of his retirement and other investment goals. Hence, it makes sense for him to have a look at what is called systematic investment plan (SIP) which entails investment of a small amount of money at regular intervals, say weekly, monthly or quarterly into an investment fund. A small investment made regularly yields handsome returns over a long-term horizon due to the magic of compounding. As per the instructions of the investor, a pre-decided amount is debited from the bank account and invested in the specified MF or stock/s on a pre-decided date. The investor is allocated with certain number of units/stocks based on the ongoing market rate for the day. \n\nThus, SIP is essentially an investment vehicle wherein an investor invests fixed amount at regular intervals say monthly or quarterly to form a substantial corpus over a period of time say at the time of retirement. SIP-ing should be done in direct equities or mutual funds tilted towards equity. \n\nThe right portfolio mix \n\nThe retirement investment mix is very important for yielding the best results. So how should be the investment mix for retirement planning? The prime objective of any investment is that a) it should beat the inflation at any given time by a margin and b) by a specified date (of retirement) the corpus should be sufficient enough that it could pay a monthly amount to take care of the daily expenses. \n\nEquities are considered the most rewarding investment option, if held over a long duration . Studies have proved that investments in equity held for long tenure have yielded far superior returns than any other investment. \n\nEquity investment has been the largest wealth creator, globally. The average annual return of the stock market over the period of last sixteen years (2001 till date), considering the Nifty50 index as the benchmark to compute the returns, has been around 15 per cent. \n\nMoreover, equity investments brings with it a) ease of transaction and highly liquid asset class as one can make an investment or exit at a phone call on any working day b) very low cost of transaction and ease of storage using the dematerialized format. \n\nThus, equity investment, being adequately regulated, is relatively safe and rewarding compared to other form of investment, say real estate or gold . \n\nIf one starts early, his exposure to equities should be significantly higher and with age one can gradually shift to more stable asset class viz., the debt funds , EPF, PPF. This strategy will ensure a growth oriented portfolio alongwith the comfort and certainty about the amount that would be available in hand post retirement. \n\nMake it a habit to do regular monitoring \n\nOne must regularly update his retirement plans. If your last retirement plan was prepared 5 years back earlier to your kid’s birth, your change of job, or city of work, your parents moving in with you, it’s high time you should have a re-look at your retirement plan and the mix. \n\nThe bottom line is one should not take retirement planning lightly and should devote serious time for the same or look for expert advice. In addition, one must try step up the investments periodically. Instead of committing an absolute amount per month, one should allocate a certain percentage of income towards retirement planning, which on compounding over a period will be sufficient enough to cover all the expenses after retirement. \n\nCare for healthcare \n\nOn an average, around 20% of the expenses should be allocated to healthcare, post retirement. It is, therefore, quite important to either build a retirement corpus incorporating medical expenses when one is young and healthy. \n\nOne should also enrol for an adequately comprehensive health insurance product. The chosen product should have adequate coverage of medical ailments as wide as possible with limited exclusions . \n\nAgain, one should buy a health insurance policy early as it not only reduces the burden of premium paid but it also covers you against illness/treatments that require you to serve several waiting periods. \n\nWith an early cover, one can earn loyalty bonus as most health insurance policies offer a loyalty or- no claim bonus if the customer continues with the same policy year on year. \n\nA systematic withdrawal plan can work wonders \n\nFinally, as one approaches retirement, one should ascertain the regular cash flows say monthly, quarterly or annually are being delivered by the investment corpus. The Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) will come handy to meet this need. So let us discuss how does a SWP work? The SWP is a facility that allows an investor to withdraw money from an existing investment say MF at predetermined intervals. SWP, in essence, is the reverse of an SIP. Thus in SWP, the investor regularly withdraws a fixed amount of money from a lump sum already invested in a fund i.e. the investor directs the AMC to redeem a designated sum of money and/or units at a pre-determined regular intervals and credit the sum to his/ her bank account. \n\nThe amount to be withdrawn and the frequency say monthly, quarterly, half yearly, or annually, are decided by the investor as per his needs. The fund’s value and number of units will reduce to the extent of each withdrawal. This process will continue till complete holding is redeemed. \n\nThe withdrawal of corpus from retirement fund attracts income tax . However, if your investments are in direct equity or tilted towards mutual funds with equity exposure, then it makes it a tax efficient strategy as one would not have to pay capital gain tax on investments above 1 year while redemption. \n\nThus, following are the steps one should keep in mind while designing retirement solutions: \n\na) Start Early and take help of a financial advisor \n\nb) Make use of Systematic Investment plans (SIP) to build the portfolio \n\nc) Ensure higher allocation to equity for a growth oriented portfolio \n\nd) Regularly monitor the performance and step up your investments \n\ne) Get a health insurance early \n\nf) Plan systematic withdrawal of funds post retirement \n\n(Arun Thukral is MD & CEO of Axis Securities.
