This is the news that every Malayali has been waiting for. Let’s check out what Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and actress Manju Warrier had to say about this latest development. \n“Kerala police have done a fine job. I congratulate the team that caught Pulsar Sunil,” Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters.Reacting to this news, actress Manju Warrier told reporters, “I am very happy that the main accused in this case has been caught by police.

Finally, the truth will come out.” \nWhen asked whether this incident had been a planned attack or not, actress Manju Warrier categorically said, “It was a planned criminal conspiracy. You (media) and the police have said so repeatedly. I am not the only one who thinks so.”We agree that Pulsar Sunil was taken into custody by police this afternoon. But first, this is how the events played out: \nAt noon, Pulsar Sunil jumped over a wall to enter the court premises. He reached the court riding a Pulsar bike.

Even the ‘shadow’ police that had been deployed across most court areas failed to spot him. You may also like to watch this \nSeriously, how cool is that? What ‘daring’ work did the cops do? They swooped down on a guy who wanted to surrender in court and entered the premises undetected even by the shadow police! \nYou’ve read this correctly. The guy called Pulsar Sunil had just walked in – the same guy whom the Kerala cops have been ‘searching’ for the last 6 days! And when they did, they pounced on Pulsar Sunil – as the Magistrate was not in the courtroom and then they used force to take him and Vigeesh into custody.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T14:24:29.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
