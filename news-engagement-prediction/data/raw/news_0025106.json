Here’s why business Updated: Feb 08, 2017 16:29 IST Hindustan Times People walk past the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) head office in Mumbai.(Reuters) \nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept its repo rate on hold at 6.25% for a second straight policy meeting, opting to wait for more clarity on inflation trends and on how demonetisation is impacting economic growth. \nThe RBI’s monetary policy committee on Wednesday voted 6-0, its third unanimous decision in a row since being established in September. \nWhile expectation is running high of a 25 basis point rate cut on Wednesday, here are the factors that could hold RBI governor Urijit Patel back from announcing a cut: \nImpact of demonetisation: \nThe consumer price index ( CPI) or retail inflation fell from 2.59% in November to 2.23% in December. It could cool further. But these falling numbers should be seen from the perspective of the squeeze in demand following demonetisation. \nGlobal cues: \nOil prices have been on the rise ever since the petroleum exporting countries decided to freeze production. Upward-bound oil prices will push inflationary trends up. Along with oil, there are also expectations that global commodity prices will also see a spike in 2017. \nRising oil prices present a challenge to India’s growth, said the Economic Survey presented in Parliament earlier this week. “Price of crude oil (Indian basket) has increased from $39.9 in April 2016 to $52.7 in December 2016. For the next financial year, the recent uptick in global commodity prices, in particular crude oil prices, pose an upside risk,” it said. \nUS monetary policy: \nThe current interest rate effected by the US Federal Reserve at 0.75% shows signs of inching up. And there are expectations of a few hikes in 2017. This does not bode well for India, as a US rate hike will see dollar funds flee emerging markets. A revival of the US economy will strengthen the dollar putting pressure not only on the Indian rupee but also on the Indian exports.
