Two concerns I had from the get go were that I 1) wouldn't like the taste and 2) it'd turn my mouth purple as if I'd been popping grape-flavored Jolly Ranchers all day. As for the former, it wasn't as minty as my normal drugstore toothpaste, but it was 100% tolerable. The same goes for the mouthwash. And my tongue post lavender mouth cleanse? It was, in fact, purple. But only for a few minutes and then it went away.

It was subtle, but my coffee addiction and predilection for red wine was less obvious i.e. my smile was a little whiter and brighter–especially when I wore a lip color. And after two weeks, I really saw a difference, the boost it gave my go-to red, MAC's Ruby Woo , as the benchmark. It didn't make my computer-paper white per se, but I liked it that way. I was also pleased that there was no weird sensitivity either, which is something I've struggled with in other whitening treatments. All in all, I have a new color-minded essential to add to my beauty routine and I'd recommend this stuff to anyone looking to give their smile some peroxide-free whitening love.
