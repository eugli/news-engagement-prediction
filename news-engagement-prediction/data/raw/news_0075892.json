Story continues below \nShe was denied parole at a hearing last year despite admitting for the first time she was responsible for Virk’s death. \nEllard was 15-years old when she smashed Virk’s head against a tree and held her underwater until she stopped moving. \nREAD MORE: Timeline: Reena Virk murder and the trials of Kelly Ellard \nEllard was asking for up to five escorted short absences from prison every month for “parental responsibilities.” \nHer case made news last October after a report said she was eight months pregnant following a conjugal visit with her boyfriend. \nFurther information about her baby has not been released. \nEllard has had escorted absences from the prison in the past, likely for medical appointments. \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T20:14:39.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
