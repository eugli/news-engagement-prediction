My family will miss the great people here and the University of Tennessee.\" Slot to Tennessee Links Tennessee wide receivers coach Zach Azzanni (Photo: Wes Rucker, 247Sports) Zach Azzanni's relationship with Butch Jones dates back to 1998, when Azzanni was finishing his career as a Central Michigan wide receiver and Jones joined the Chippewas' staff from Ferris State as a tight ends coach. After stops at Valparaiso, as wide receivers coach from 1999-2000, and Bowling Green, first as a graduate assistant and later as a receivers coach from 2001-06, Azzanni was back on staff at Central Michigan from 2007-09, when Jones ran the program as head coach. After stops at three schools in three years — Florida (2010, receivers coach), Western Kentucky (2011, offensive coordinator), Wisconsin (2012, receivers coach) — Azzanni found a home at Tennessee in 2013, coaching receivers again for Jones after he was hired away from Cincinnati to take over the Vols. \n(Want the latest scoop on Tennessee football and basketball?

Tennessee wide outs combined for 3,100 receiving yards and 28 touchdown catches last season, led by Josh Malone and Jauan Jennings. Malone had 50 catches for 972 yards and 11 touchdowns. Jennings had 4o grabs for 580 yards and seven scores. Receivers accounted for 2,582 yards in 2015, led by Von Pearson's 38 catches for 409 yards and three touchdowns. Marquez North as a freshman in 2013 earned SEC All-Freshman honors after catching 38 passes for 496 yards. North's 38 catches rank second all-time for Tennessee freshmen. \" Butch Jones was not only a boss but a mentor and a friend,\" Azzanni said. \"My family will miss the great people here and the University of Tennessee.\" \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .)
