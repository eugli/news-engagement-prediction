I actively tried not to. In fact I prepped myself by thinking of my own grandma and how upset I’d be if someone just nonchalantly shoved her to the ground like a rag doll. \nBut I couldn’t help myself. It’s impossible. I laughed my ass off. I’m laughing thinking about how much I laughed. I mean have you ever seen something go down so easily? With such little effort? Poor old lady out there trying to stand for something instead gets pushed right over. Calling it a shove might be overstating this dude’s effort. Might have to toss an amendment into the Constitution that states if you can’t absorb at least the minimal amount of physical resistance then you can’t protest. That’s the 54 inches you need to get on the rollercoaster. If you can’t remain standing from a light forearm push then you gotta stay inside. Not allowed at the protest. I think that’s fair and better for everyone. \n\nPS — For all those concerned, grandma’s fine. \n\nBaker, who is a 65-year-old retired schoolteacher, said the elderly woman was able to get up off the ground on her own and was not injured during the incident.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:35:38.026+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
