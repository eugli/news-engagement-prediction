Selectively disclosing details of private conversations monitored by the FBI or NSA gives the permanent state the power to destroy reputations from the cloak of anonymity. This is what police states do.\"\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer echoed those concerns during his daily briefing Tuesday afternoon, remarking, \"We have to wonder that people who work for our government, who are entrusted with classified information, decisional-based materials are leaking that information out. That, I do believe is a big story.\"\n  In an interview with the Daily Caller News Foundation conducted hours before his resignation, Flynn himself argued, \"You call them leaks. It's a criminal act. This is a crime. It's not just a wink and a nod.\"\n\"One has to wonder: are they coming out of people in the National Security Council? Are they coming out of people in the intel community? Or State? Or Defense?\" Flynn told the Daily Caller.\nThere is a reasonable case to be made that intelligence officials, whose job is to monitor people in other countries and who are prohibited from spying on Americans, are actively leaking sensitive information with the intentions of undermining the Trump administration. Indeed it is possible that anti-Trump forces in the government are guilty of exploiting their own power to undermine the White House.\nThat seems like an issue worthy of concern from all Americans interested in the potential abuse of government power, regardless of their party membership.\n\"In normal times,\" Lake wrote, \"the idea that U.S. officials entrusted with our most sensitive secrets would selectively disclose them to undermine the White House would alarm those worried about creeping authoritarianism.\"\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Report: Pence first learned of DOJ's warning about Flynn last week \nVice President Pence was reportedly made aware of a warning by Justice Department officials about ousted White House national security adviser last week, more than 10 days after President Trump received the alert himself.\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer told reporters on Tuesday that the Justice Department had informed Trump on Jan. 26 that Flynn had misled the White House about his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the day the previous administration announced new sanctions against Moscow.\nTrump had asked White House counsel Doug McGahn to investigate the situation the day he received the agency's warning, while sources told NBC News that Pence remained in the dark.\nBy Gabby Morrongiello â€¢ 02/14/17 5:55 PM Perhaps these developments are simply another indication that the times in which we live are anything but normal.\nEmily Jashinsky is a commentary writer for the Washington Examiner. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T00:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T01:11:30.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
