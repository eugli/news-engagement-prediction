Pitino seemed to be visibly angered with what appeared to be a heckling fan. \nHere’s the video, via ESPN. Something quite clearly catches Pitino’s ear, and he looks ready to rumble almost immediately. \nAccording to ESPN sideline reporter Maria Taylor, a fan yelled, “Pitino, you suck!” and that is what prompted this reaction from the 64-year-old coach. \nThe fan was ejected, according to Taylor. Here’s a shorter version, with crowd audio, from the game. Via Sports Illustrated’s Jonathan Jones.
