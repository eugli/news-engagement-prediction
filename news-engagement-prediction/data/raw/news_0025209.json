Daily Edition Senate Reviews 'Oprah' Interview With Wife of Labor Secretary Nominee 5:58 PM PST 2/13/2017 by THR Staff COMMENTS Getty Images The ex-wife of Trumpâ€™s nominee, Andrew Puzder, appeared decades ago in disguise to discuss her experience with domestic violence. \nAn episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show has come under review in the Senate as the confirmation hearing nears for Labor Secretary nominee Andrew Puzder. \nPuzder's former wife, Lisa Fierstein, appeared on an episode of Winfrey's show in disguise, according to Politico , in which she accused him of physical abuse. \nThe Oprah Winfrey Network reportedly turned over the video of her appearance to senators, who will soon vote on Puzder's nomination. Puzder is the CEO of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of Hardee's and Carl's Jr. \nIn a legal document obtained by Politico, Fierstein had claimed that her ex husband had \"assaulted and battered\" her and she \"suffered severe and permanent injuries\" during their marriage. Her allegations first began to surface around the time of their divorce in the late 1980s and have resurfaced thanks to Puzder'z nomination by President Trump. \nPuzder has denied his ex wife's claims of abuse, and Fierstein has since retracted her statements she made on the show. She has even sent a letter to senators saying she regrets making the allegations, CNN reports. \nThe allegations fueled opposition against Puzder, which is being led by women's rights groups, unions and other labor rights groups who worry about his views on regulations and the minimum wage. Puzder's confirmation has continuously been delayed, in part because of this opposition as well as the continuing hearings of Trump's other nominees.
