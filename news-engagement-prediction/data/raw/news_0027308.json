For Deadpool 2 , the two primary new characters being introduced are Cable and Domino . There's been a lot of rumors and speculation about who will play the cyborg badass from the future and the equally badass woman whose luck is practically unlimited. However, today a potential new candidate for the latter has been revealed. \nThe Hashtag Show uploaded casting details earlier today about what Deadpool 2 's Domino will be like. Interestingly enough, rather than have a pseudonym attached (as is often done with high profile projects), Domino is directly referred to by her civilian name, Neena Thurman. But that's beside the point. As far as actresses go, Scandal 's Kerry Washington is reportedly testing to play Domino and is the \"current frontrunner,\" but nothing is official yet. Sienna Miller and Gugu Mbatha-Raw also both tested for the role, but ultimately passed. \nWhether or not Kerry Washington scores the Domino role remains to be seen, but her acting talents would certainly be most welcome in the Deadpool world. Best known for playing Olivia Pope on the ABC series Scandal , her other notable credits include Ray , Fantastic Four , Lakeview Terrace , Django Unchained , Boston Legal and Confirmation . Given Washington's busy shooting schedule for Scandal , making time for Deadpool 2 would be difficult, but it would be fun to see her acting as the straightforward foil to Ryan Reynolds' insane Wade Wilson. \nFor those unfamiliar with Domino, she is a mutant who can subconsciously manipulate probability around her to make improbable (note: not impossible) events occur, this giving her a lot of \"good luck\" and making her opponents \"unlucky.\" This effect is usually activated when she's in a stressful situation, and when it comes to life-threatening moments, she has to take action to survive in other for the probability-alteration to occur. Along with this natural gift, Domino is a skilled mercenary, trained in several forms of martial arts and able to use a variety of firearms. While she's been a supporting character in Deadpool's corner of the Marvel universe, she's primarily tied to the X-Force , and has even been Cable's confidante and romanic interest. She was also a member of the X-Men for a time. Since Cable is also involved with Deadpool 2 , perhaps we'll see a similar dynamic on the big screen. \nDeadpool 2 doesn't have an official release date yet, but it's expected to hit theaters sometime in 2018. We'll let you know once an official Domino casting has been announced, but for now, let us know what you think of Kerry Washington potentially playing the character in the comments below.
