Some of the students expelled this year by East Aurora School District were those involved in a stabbing during a fight across from East Aurora High School, a trash can fire in a high school bathroom and a fight involving students, adults and school officials at the high school. (The Beacon-News / Sarah Freishtat) Privacy Policy \nEast Aurora School District 131 officials have expelled more students nearly six months into the current school year than they did all last school year. \nThe uptick comes the same year as a new discipline law that includes measures designed to limit punishments that remove kids from class. \nSo far this school year, board members approved the expulsion of 11 students, meeting minutes and coverage by the Beacon-News show. During the previous school year, board members approved the outright expulsion of three students and, for a fourth student, specified the expulsion could be modified to a placement in an alternative program on the condition that student attended drug and alcohol counseling. They approved sending three other students to alternative programs in lieu of expulsion that year, meeting minutes show. \nMark McDonald, one of the district's two interim superintendents, said in a written statement the district regrets having to expel any student from school, and characterized the decision to do so as \"the most difficult decision educators and boards of education have to make.\" \n\"Some student conduct, however, is impossible for the district to tolerate while still maintaining a safe school environment for the majority of our students who come to school intending to learn,\" he said. \"The students recently expelled acted willfully, without regard to the safety and welfare of others, and we believe we had no choice (but) to act as we did.\" \nUnder the new state law, which took effect in September, certain types of discipline – including expulsions, longer suspensions and placement in an alternative school – can only be used if a student's presence in class is deemed a significant disruption or threat, or if administrators have tried other disciplinary actions. It also prohibits zero-tolerance polices that lead to automatic suspensions or expulsions for certain behavior, and sets several other requirements. Several Fox Valley districts were working on measures to reduce or replace such discipline practices before the bill took effect. \nIn East Aurora, an administrator who at the time was working on efforts to comply with the law and has since left the district described to the Beacon-News last spring several ways the district was rethinking its response to student infractions, along with steps it would take to meet other requirements of the law. But he said students who cause disruptions to learning or who pose a threat to themselves or others could still face suspension or expulsion. \nMcDonald, in his statement, said the bill is designed to reduce suspensions and expulsions by providing students with \"support systems\" to improve their experiences at school, and causes educators to examine each instance a student would be excluded from school because of their behavior. \n\"District 131 has stepped up its efforts at student supports and interventions and also revised its discipline policies to meet the requirements of the law,\" he said. \"(The law) does not prevent boards of education from expelling students for deliberate dangerous actions in which students and staff have been injured, or when a student clearly threatens the safety of the student body and faculty. When those occur, we believe the district needs to respond accordingly.\" \nStudent discipline has been a point of contention in East Aurora, as it has in some other Fox Valley districts. During teacher and staff contract negotiations last school year, some East Aurora teachers highlighted \"constant disruptions\" in some classrooms and called for consistent discipline. \nThis year's expulsions have been approved between November 2016 and February 2017, including one instance where five East Aurora High School students were expelled in one meeting in January. Last school year, the expulsions and alternative program placements were each approved between December 2015 and February 2016. \nSchool board President Annette Johnson said some of the students expelled this year were those involved in a stabbing during a fight across from the high school, a trash can fire in a high school bathroom and a fight involving students, adults and school officials at the high school. Those incidents, all in December, led to the arrest of five students and two adults, and district officials have said they were unrelated. \n\"Yes, there is a new state law, but the issues that have been coming up are related to student safety,\" Johnson said. \nShe said the district is working on a variety of services for at-risk kids. \nMcDonald said numbers of expulsions vary from year to year, and said this year's expulsions would be affected by several \"significant disciplinary incidents\" involving multiple students. \n\"That said, we have over 3,800 students at East High School, the vast majority of whom are good students and citizens making good choices and focused on contributing to their school community,\" he said. \"Our responsibility to those students is to take appropriate actions to keep our school safe.\" \nTwitter @srfreish", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T06:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:02:05.539+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
