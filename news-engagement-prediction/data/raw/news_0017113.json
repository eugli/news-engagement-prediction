As the 47-year-old musician happened to catch the flick as it aired on Lifetime, he said it was first time he'd thoroughly watched it. Chris even talked about what he thought of Jennifer Lopez's performance as the late pop star as it helped launch the career of the 47-year-old actress and singer. Scroll below for video Opening up: Selena's widower Chris Perez, 47, live-blogged his thoughts on the 1997 film Selena as it aired on Lifetime this week Tragic tale: The story of the singer's storybook rise and tragic fall was turned into a movie less than two years after she was murdered by her fan club president Perez said the nascent A-lister 'did a great f***ing job' in her breakout role. The I Could Fall in Love singer's life story was adapted into a Warner Bros. motion picture that was released March 21, 1997. It even racked up a Golden Globe nomination. It was released less than two years after the beloved performer was fatally gunned down at the age of 23 by her fan club president, Yolanda Saldivar, on March 31, 1995. Rising star: Selena was on the verge of major crossover success at the time her life was tragically cut short Immortalized: Actor Jon Seda (left, with Lopez) played Perez in the 1997 motion picture Eye-opening: Perez said this was his first time watching the film at full attention, as his 'eyes were closed half of the time' when he attended the premiere about 20 years ago On Monday, Perez wrote on his Facebook page: 'Guess what just started on the Lifetime tv channel...yup. Gonna grab a bottle of wine from the kitchen and sit through the movie in it's entirety for the first time ... Wish me luck. This is gonna be surreal.' Perez, a 47-year-old guitar player, noted that his 'eyes were closed half of the time' when he attended the premiere about 20 years ago. The musician was admittedly emotional as he took in the biopic, as he wrote, 'Ugh, don't know if I can do this. The TRUE test will be when my \"character\" comes out.' Baring his soul: Perez shared his raw thoughts with his Facebook followers as he watched the motion picture Art imitates life: Lopez (left) played Selena (right) in the 1997 biopic about the late singer Perez commented as he took in scenes he'd lived in his life, including their first time telling one another, 'I love you,' and when he trashed a hotel room. 'Room trashing happened....Oh God,' he wrote. 'Not one of my prouder moments. But I paid THOUSANDS in damages. Lesson Learned.' The lesson, he said, was that 'when you mess up bad, pay for your mistakes [and] do a great job after .... NO ONE can dispute your talent.' Murderer: Yolanda Saldívar, seen here in her mug shot, was convicted in 1995 in the killing Wrapping up, Perez said he was 'super proud' in taking in the film, but was not going to subject himself to the scene in which she's killed. 'Will not watch the ending of the movie,' he wrote. 'G'night everyone.' Saldivar was subsequently convicted in October of 1995 of first-degree murder and sentenced to life with no possibility of parole for at least 30 years, which remains eight years and eight months away.
