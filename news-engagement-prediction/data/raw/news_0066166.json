Guys will start making adjustments and putting the ball in play more.\" MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred pitched rule changes — including a pitch clock, adjustments to strike zone dimensions and limits on mound visits —for the start of the 2017 season, but the players' union rebuffed those suggestions with the exception of a new protocol that will eliminate the antiquated intentional walk procedure. \"I have to admit that I'm disappointed we could not even get the MLBPA to agree to modest rule changes — like limit trips to the (pitcher’s) mound — that had little effect on the competitive character of the game,\" Manfred said Tuesday, per USA Today 's Bob Nightengale . However, change appears to be on the horizon in some shape or form. According to Nightengale, MLB has the ability to impose rule alterations for the 2018 season without the MLBPA's consent. As far as Mattingly's point is concerned, Manfred said Tuesday that home runs have increased by 32 percent and strikeouts are up by 67 percent since 1980. According to Nightengale, Manfred noted \" baseball had more inactivity during games than at any other time in history.\" With Manfred determined to modernize the game and a slew of opinions circulating the sport on how best to institute reforms, debate figures to rage on through the spring and summer as MLB hunkers down and examines its options moving forward.
