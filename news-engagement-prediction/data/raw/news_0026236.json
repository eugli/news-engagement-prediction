Forget the ones from the countries designation by Hillary Clinton’s State Department as terrorist countries. For decades now, if you ask Americans do you want immigration to stay the same, go up or be reduced — nobody wants it to go up. And I believe it’s been a consistent majority saying, ‘No, fewer, fewer, fewer immigrants. We’ve taken in enough. America needs a break.’ We have taken, as I describe in ‘Adios America, for the past several decades, America has taken in more refugees than the entire rest of the world combined. Our country is not a battered woman’s shelter. We’re not here to take in all the charity cases of the world. This was the point of this election — please help us, the American people, including immigrants who have come in.”\nFollow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor\nRead More Stories About: Breitbart TV , Ann Coulter , immigration , refugees , Sean Hannity", "external_links": ["http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/google_plusone_share/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fcoulter-on-immigration-policy-our-country-is-not-a-battered-womans-shelter%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Coulter+on+Immigration+Policy%3A+%E2%80%98Our+Country+Is+Not+a+Battered+Woman%E2%80%99s+Shelter%E2%80%99", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/twitter/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fcoulter-on-immigration-policy-our-country-is-not-a-battered-womans-shelter%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Coulter+on+Immigration+Policy%3A+%E2%80%98Our+Country+Is+Not+a+Battered+Woman%E2%80%99s+Shelter%E2%80%99&shortener=bitly", "http://twitter.com/jeff_poor", "http://api.addthis.com/oexchange/0.8/forward/facebook/offer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.breitbart.com%2Fvideo%2F2017%2F02%2F13%2Fcoulter-on-immigration-policy-our-country-is-not-a-battered-womans-shelter%2F&pubid=ra-536db77a775cf072&text=Coulter+on+Immigration+Policy%3A+%E2%80%98Our+Country+Is+Not+a+Battered+Woman%E2%80%99s+Shelter%E2%80%99"], "published": "2017-02-13T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:53:30.889+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
