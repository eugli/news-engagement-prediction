It is unclear when he came to New Zealand. The incident appears to have been sparked when Mr Mattran drove through the storage yard faster than the 8km/h speed limit. Video shows Mr Mattran being told to 'go back to your own f***ing country', before he claims the other driver soaked him with a hose Mr Mattran told the Indian Weekender: 'I am not sure why that gentleman launched a racial tirade against me. It possibly could be because I might be going slightly faster. 'For that matter, even car washing was not allowed in the vicinity as I confirmed with the facility manager this morning.' The footage went viral after being uploaded to the New Zealand Police Facebook page, and has since been viewed tens of thousands of times. Officers urged Mr Mattran to make a formal complaint to police, but it is unclear whether any report has yet been filed. Daily Mail Australia has contacted officers for more information, but had not heard back at the time of publication.
