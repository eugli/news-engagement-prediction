Ryle linebacker Jackson High will join Kentucky's football team later this year.\nHe spoke with Cats Illustrated this week to share his thoughts on his choice and his future.\n\"I'm pumped for it,\" the 6-foot, 230-pound linebacker said in reference to his decision to accept a preferred walk-on spot with Kentucky's football program. \"I'm real excited to get down there honestly. I'm ready to start lifting and all that.\"\nHigh doesn't know exactly when he'll be arriving at Kentucky. He should know that later this month.\nSo how did High and the Kentucky coaching staff get to the point where they're at today?\n\"Kentucky first approached me in January around the 14th or 15th,\" High recalled. \"Once that happened it kind of just shot off and I couldn't pass down that opportunity. After going on a visit there and seeing everything I just couldn't pass on it.\"\nHigh had visited Kentucky about four other times in the past, mostly to go to games when he was younger since he only lives about an hour away. But his recent trip to UK was his first and only unofficial visit as a prospect in the sights of the coaching staff.\n\"I got to tour the facilities, all the new ones, and see the football field,\" High said.\nHigh's parents both attended Kentucky and he said he has been a fan of the Cats' basketball and football teams since he was young.\nHe wasn't expecting this opportunity to arise, but he didn't need to think much about it once it came up. Recruiting graduate assistant Ian Kalinowski was the staff member who approached High and worked to bring him into the program.\nThe Ryle linebacker had 108 tackles (74 solo) as a high school senior in the fall.\nWhile he will be a preferred walk-on with Kentucky's football team, High had a total of eight scholarship offers. Two were from FCS schools, Valparaiso and Morehead State, while the other six were from Division II or Division III programs.\nEdit", "external_links": ["https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/fgz375wbokudoktec2gd)", "https://res-4.cloudinary.com/rivals/image/upload/t_large/fgz375wbokudoktec2gd"], "published": "2017-02-09T14:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T07:35:56.083+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
