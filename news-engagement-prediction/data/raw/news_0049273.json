The National Front has slammed the accusations as politically motivated and unsubstantiated.

However, she is still poised to lose in the runoff in May, when she could face either centrist Emmanuel Macron or mainstream right-wing candidate François Fillon. \nMonday’s operation coincided with Le Pen’s two-day trip to Lebanon, during which she for the first time since the beginning of her presidential campaign met with a foreign head of state, the country’s President Michel Aoun, and Prime Minister Saad Hariri. \nREAD MORE: National Front is only force standing for Europe of sovereign states – Marion Marechal-Le Pen to RT \nLast Wednesday, French police paid a visit to the Nanterre headquarters, spurring a sharp reaction from the FN, which said that the raid was an attempt by the authorities to “hinder, spy on and intimidate the patriotic opposition.” \nBoth raids were conducted in line with the probe launched by the Paris Prosecutor’s Office on December 15. Among the charges Le Pen faces are “fraud,” “breach of trust,” an “attempt to commit fraud” and others. All the allegations are revolving around FN hiring 20 assistants for its European MPs who were allegedly working at the party’s Nanterre office instead of Brussels, Strasbourg or the MPs’ constituencies. Read more ‘Political game’: Le Pen slams party fraud accusations as false \nThe investigation was initiated by the European Parliament in 2015 as then-President of the European Parliament Martin Schultz asked the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to look into potential mishandling of funds by the FN. \n\"One cannot be paid by the European Parliament and work for a party,\" he said at the time. \nAs part of the probe, Le Pen herself is accused of hiring two assistants, Thierry Légier and Catherine Griset, who were engaged in the work not related to their perceived job as parliamentary aides. \nAn OLAF report released last week claimed that Thierry Legier had been wrongly paid some 41,554 euros ($44,000) from EU Parliament funds as an aide, while in effect he was working as Le Pen’s bodyguard. \n“The inquiry has found that the MP drew up a fictional contract regarding one of her assistants,” the OLAF spokesman said last Thursday, commenting on the case. However, Le Pen brushed off the accusations, saying that there was “absolutely nothing false about it.” \nAs result of the earlier investigation into the probe, the European Parliament had already ordered Le Pen to reimburse 336,146 euros ($357,000) to the Parliament. However, as she keeps denying all the allegations, the money is going to be deducted from her salary as an MP.
