Gorsuch . \nPopovich’s comments Monday, in full: \n“Sometimes when life moves along, you’re presented with situations where you just find it necessary to speak,” he said, “because so many people seem to be afraid to, or are unwilling to face it and (instead) let things go and just worry about their own situation. Most of those people have had opportunities that the majority have not. \n“So I think it’s important for people who’ve had opportunity to make sure that other people with opportunity know that they were very, very, very fortunate. That could have been having a couple of parents, where you were born, what your skin color is, what country you were born in. It’s all chance. You didn’t do that. You get no credit for that, for getting those opportunities. People have an easy time forgetting that. \n“The situation now, I find a lot of people are in charge – or will be in charge shortly when they’re nominated – have very little clue about what many, many people have to go through to live in this world. Some days I feel like we’ve been invaded by another power and taken over (by people) who don’t feel the same. It’s a strange land.” \nPopovich was asked a follow-up: What does he think of all the athletes and coaches who don’t speak up? \n“I don’t worry too much,” he said. “Somebody (could) say: ‘Go coach your basketball team, go do this, go say you’re sorry, go run the football,’ whatever it might be. I think it’s important that we don’t forget. \n“We all hope that President Trump is successful. We hope he does some good things for everybody. But he didn’t start the presidency by mollifying any groups that he disparaged. He didn’t say anything (conciliatory toward) black people, or Mexican people, Hispanic people, LGBT people, handicapped people. Acted like it never happened. \n“So that willingness to do whatever’s necessary to get elected, to say and act the way he did, I thought was unacceptable and really disgusting. So I said it. And I think that even people who voted for him can see that, but for some reason they feel they can afford to forget about it. \n“(Trump’s) personality and his inability to get over himself and form his words and his decisions – that’s what scares me.” \nThe next question asked of Popovich: Will Jonathan Simmons be available tonight? \n\"Yes,\" Popovich said. \nFind IndyStar columnist Gregg Doyel on Twitter at @GreggDoyelStar or at facebook.com/gregg.doyel 173 CONNECT 13 COMMENT EMAIL MORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T10:13:15.562+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
