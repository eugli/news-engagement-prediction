(Gerald Herbert/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated:   3:47 PM \nWASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security released new policies on Tuesday outlining a major expansion of which undocumented immigrants the government views as deportation priorities. \nThe pair of memoranda call for any undocumented immigrants to be deported if they've been convicted or even charged with a criminal offense, “have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits.” or have \"have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter before a governmental agency,\" criteria that could include offenses like traffic infractions, receiving any government assistance, and using fake Social Security numbers to be able to work, common offenses among undocumented immigrants. \nThe new guidelines also give immigration officials broad latitude to deport anyone who they deem \"otherwise pose[s] a risk to public safety or national security.” \nThose guidelines codify and expand upon a pair of executive orders signed by President Trump to rapidly escalate the number deportations of undocumented immigrants, a push that has already reportedly started with sweeps in major U.S. cities in recent weeks. \nDonald Trump hurls Twitter attacks at ‘Morning Joe’ co-hosts \nThe memos undo Obama administration guidelines that told DHS and Immigration & Customs Enforcement agents to prioritize the deportation of those who'd committed serious crimes or are national security threats, as well as those who recently entered the country. They also greatly expand expedited removal of undocumented immigrants, allowing customs agents to deport more people faster and with fewer hurdles. The memos expand the period of expedited removal from two weeks to two years after people enter the country, and eliminate a requirement that they were within 100 miles of the border. Outrageous quotes from Donald Trump's presidential nomination speech \nPro-immigrant groups decried the new policies. \n“These memos lay out a detailed blueprint for the mass deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants in America. They fulfill the wish lists of the white nationalist and anti-immigrant movements and bring to life the worst of Donald Trump’s campaign rhetoric,\" America’s Voice Education Fund Deputy Director Lynn Tramonte said in a statement. \nThe American Civil Liberties Union said the memos “confirm that the Trump administration is willing to trample on due process, human decency, the well-being of our communities, and even protections for vulnerable children, in pursuit of a hyper-aggressive mass deportation policy,” promising to fight them in court. \nDonald’s economic plan: The obvious Trumps the important \nThe new policies won't be cheap as the memos direct ICE to hire 10,000 new immigration and customs agents, as well as increase the number of detention facilities. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway refused to say Sunday whether her new boss was firmly committed to his original \"deportation force\" plan. (Gerald Herbert/AP) \nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said that the agencies are currently reviewing what the new directives will cost, and whether they’ll need more taxpayer money to fulfill the goals. \n“Right now ICE and DHS in particular ... are looking at what this is going to cost and how much,” he said Tuesday afternoon. \nNotably, the two Obama-era regulations that the new orders continue to let stand are the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows undocumented immigrants brought here as children to remain in the country, as well as the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program (DAPA), which allows some undocumented parents of American citizens to remain in the country. \nNo 'personal insults' from Trump? Here are 7 he's made \nTrump has repeatedly signaled mixed feelings about those programs, while saying last week that he plans \"to show great heart\" in dealing with DREAMers, a line Spicer reiterated on Tuesday — while saying that just because the memos don’t include DACA doesn’t mean the program will necessarily be left alone. Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), another adviser to Trump, also signaled that the GOP nominee could soon be reversing course on his hardline proposal. (Alex Brandon/AP) \n“The President’s made clear when you have 12, 14, 15 million people in the country illegally that there has to be a system of priority,” Spicer said, without explaining where that estimate for undocumented immigrants came from. The government has estimated approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants currently live in the U.S., a number that’s in line with studies from non-governmental organizations like Pew Research. \nFormer Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Sarah Saldana said the number of undocumented immigrants could be as high as 15 million during congressional testimony in 2015, but didn’t cite where she got that figure and government officials later downplayed it as an informal estimate. \nThe new guidelines also called to send some immigrants caught crossing the Mexican border illegally right back across the border, even if they're not Mexicans.
