May you burn in hell you evil bitch!’ It was signed ‘Maggie & Philip Fowles’, with Rev Fowles’ job title, ‘pastoral co-ordinator’, mobile phone number and address. After Ms Soubry’s staff called in police, Rev Fowles emailed her the next day to apologise and said the message was written 'in the heat of the moment' After Ms Soubry’s staff called in police, Rev Fowles emailed her the next day to say: ‘Dear Miss (sic) Soubry, I write to offer our unreserved apology for the tone of our email communication to you.’ He added that ‘the last line was written in the heat of the moment’ and admitted using ‘unwarranted language.’ Rev Fowles added: ‘Unfortunately, the whole communication inadvertently went via the St Monica Trust website and whilst the views expressed were heartfelt and personal they in no way represent those of the Trust.’ This time it was signed ‘Revd. Philip and Mrs Margaret Fowles’. Last night, St Monica Trust’s ‘head of people’, Julie Haydon, said chief executive David Williams had made a personal apology to Ms Soubry. She said: ‘Mr Fowles has been suspended pending further investigation. There hasn’t been a hearing as yet. ‘We can’t comment until we’ve concluded our internal processes. But we do obviously take matters like this incredibly seriously. Our chief executive spoke to Anna Soubry as soon as it came to our attention and expressed an apology on behalf of the Trust for any distress caused.’ The 100-year-old St Monica Trust, which describes itself as an ‘Anglican Foundation’, runs retirement communities in the West Country. It was named after founder, Dame Mary Monica Wills of the Wills Tobacco firm. Rev Fowles works at the charity’s Westbury Fields and Monica Wills House sites. He is also a lay preacher at nearby Nailsea United Reformed Church. A colleague described him as ‘impulsive’. The charity pledges to uphold ‘the dignity and spiritual well-being of residents in a non-judgmental way to share their concerns, hopes, joys and frustrations’.
