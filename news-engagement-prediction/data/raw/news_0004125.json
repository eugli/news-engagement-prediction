However, it was Jenner’s older sisters who were responsible for one of the original waves of sweatsuit fame. Before she was wearing Balmain and Yeezy (her husband’s line that happens to be filled with sweatshirts), Kim Kardashian was basically painted in Juicy Couture velour in the early 2000s. And a few months ago, the very same woman who originally kicked off the craze ignited its revival, when Kardashian covered Wonderland’s October issue in a pink Juicy track suit reminiscent of the ones she wore during the days of her Paris Hilton friendship. Now, it’s her sister’s turn to pay homage to the suit that many girls had in every color a decade ago. Khloe Kardashian was seen in black sweats when she landed in Costa Rica Monday. While anyone could be responsible for simple black pants, these were very clearly velour, and only one brand does velour so masterfully. If that wasn’t enough to convince, the iconic crystal-embellished “Juicy” butt logo was revealed in Kim’s Snapchat of North West grabbing her aunt’s “juicy” tush. In all fairness, Vetements kicked off the comeback when they designed a capsule collection with the brand, reinventing the sweatsuit. Obviously, Kardashian wasn’t wearing her old pants that she found in the back of her closet, these were a new pair of Vetements X Juicy Couture black velour track pants from their Spring 2017 runway collection. The $1,140 pants have a high-waist, slim-straight legs and an illustrious Swarovski crystal-embellished back logo. The Kardashians’s relationship with Juicy has been on and off since the early 2000s, and we think this recent reveal makes it official: the family is committed to bringing the brand back.
