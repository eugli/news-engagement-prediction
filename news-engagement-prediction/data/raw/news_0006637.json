Gladys Berejiklian's priorities as Premier \nGladys Berejiklian has made clear her plans as NSW's 45th Premier –- but can she pull them off? \nBut after Gladys Berejiklian declared that she would listen to the community on the topic, it is understood that residents in councils that have not yet merged could be given the chance to decide whether they want to amalgamate. \nIt is unclear what would happen to councils that have been merged, but if the government did not allow residents in those areas to vote on the future of their councils, there would be a certain strong backlash from MPs and residents.

Photo: Ben Rushton \nThe Premier would not confirm the government's thinking. \"As I have said, we are looking at the council amalgamation policy,\" she said through an emailed statement. \nThe first cabinet meeting since Ms Berejiklian replaced Mike Baird as Premier last Monday is to be held on Thursday. It is understood the government will want to have its position resolved before Parliament resumes on Tuesday, February 14. Advertisement \nPrior to her selection as Premier by the Liberal party room, Fairfax Media revealed that Ms Berejiklian would re-consider the contentious council merger policy. \nAlthough the government has already created 20 new councils across the state, another 11 councils are still to be created. These have largely been delayed because their constituent councils have challenged the amalgamations in court. \nThe first challenge to make it to the High Court – Woollahra's bid to prevent its merger with Waverley and Randwick – is likely to be scheduled for a hearing date to determine leave to appeal some time this month. \nMs Berejiklian has appointed politicians to key posts who have in the past strongly opposed amalgamations. The Member for Vaucluse and new Local Government Minister, Gabrielle Upton, told a public meeting in 2015: \"I believe that local governments are local. \n\"My position is that Woollahra Council should not be merged with other councils.\" \nThe Member for Lane Cove and new Planning Minister, Anthony Roberts, told a meeting in 2013: \"Bigger is not better. The case has been prosecuted that bigger is better and I don't think it will be able to be prosecuted.\" \nBoth MPs are in areas where councils have so far resisted amalgamation. Sydney councils that were to be merged under Mike Baird's government but have not yet been amalgamated are: Burwood, Canada Bay and Strathfield; Hornsby and Ku-Ring-Gai; Hunter's Hill, Lane Cove and Ryde; Mosman, North Sydney and Willoughby; and Randwick, Waverley and Woollahra. \nThe merger issue would also be contentious in the coming by-election in North Shore, which was precipitated by former health minister Jillian Skinner's retirement from politics. \nThe Nationals Leader, John Barilaro, has already committed his party to preventing any more amalgamations in regional areas. This policy would prevent the merger of Armidale Dumaresq and Guyra with Uralla and Walcha, Bathurst's merger with Oberon, Blayney's with Cabonne and Orange, and Dungog's merger with Maitland.
