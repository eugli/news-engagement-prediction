She performed twice, and save for one hiccup , she was just as amazing as she’s ever been. She also took home the awards for Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year, among others. During her last acceptance speech, for Album of the Year, she stopped to thank Beyoncé who was nominated in the category. \n“My artist of my life is Beyoncé,” she said. “And this album for me, the Lemonade album is just so monumental, Beyoncé. It was so monumental and so well thought out and so beautiful and soul-bearing and we all got to see another side of you that you don’t always let us see and we appreciate that… You are our light.” \nAdele continued, “And the way that you make me and my friends feel, and the way that you make my black friends feel is empowering and you make them stand up for themselves and I love you, and I always have and I always will.” \nBeyoncé was appreciative, and said “I love you, Adele.” \nWatch the video above. \nHave a tip we should know?
