A hardline group went around malls in East Java late last year to check whether outlets had ordered Muslim staff to wear Christmas apparel such as Santa hats. \nIn Indonesia's second largest city, Surabaya, government officials ordered schools to ban students from celebrating Valentine's Day \"in or outside of school\" because it ran counter to \"cultural and social norms\", according to a copy of the letter on the city's official website. \nA similar letter was also sent to public education agencies and schools in West Java province, according to a statement on the provincial government's website. West Java is the country's most populous province. \nWest Java and other provinces, such as Aceh, which is the only province in Indonesia to follow sharia law, have issued similar bans on celebrating Valentine's Day in previous years. \nUnder Indonesia's decentralized system of government, regional authorities are allowed to issue bylaws without approval from the central government. \n(Additional reporting by Gayatri Suroyo; Writing by Ed Davies; Editing by Randy Fabi) Next In World News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T14:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T09:33:59.265+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
