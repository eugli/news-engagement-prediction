A photo posted by D A P H N E O Z (@daphneoz) on Feb 5, 2017 at 4:56pm PST \"I feel safe posting pics like this for all of you because I get how hard it is to feel good in our skin -- whether we're trying to lose or gain weight, whether we've had babies or not. We are under constant scrutiny,\" the mother of two wrote in response to the negative comments. \"I am not perfect, I have not reached all my goals, I still see all my flaws first. But progress is everything, and one positive feeling begets another.\" RELATED: Daphne Oz Hits the Beach in Bikini One Month After Giving Birth \"This is a space for positivity and smart strategies and results, but most importantly, it is a place for celebration and FUN,\" she continued. \"I love that you guys shut down the obvious trolls that show up on here every now and then because they seriously have no other place or way to feel heard. I try not to give them too much thought, but know that I appreciate every single one of you and you make me smile and feel good every day.\" She concluded her post by writing, \"I hope I can do the same for you. THANK YOU!\" accompanied with a heart emoji.
