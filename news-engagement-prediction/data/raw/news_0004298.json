Anti-wheelie technology currently in use modulates the power going to the rear wheel, reducing output to achieve the same end. With the nozzle, the motorcycle theoretically could constantly adjust the pressure of the exhaust, while continuing to send as much power to the rear wheel as the tire can handle.\nThe technology hasn’t yet been spotted being tested on one of Ducati’s race or street bikes, but with news that it’s planning to introduce a street legal model powered by a version of its V4 racing engin e, it’s going to need all the help keeping those front wheels on the ground it can get.", "external_links": ["https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/racing/motogp/2017/january/ducati-patents-jet-exhaust", "http://www.visordown.com/motorcycle-news-new-bikes/ducati-confirms-plans-v4-superbike"], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:16:29.069+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
