But at nighttime, there’s one person there.” \nSTARS Air Ambulance transported the victim to hospital in Edmonton where she remained in stable condition Monday, said Cpl. Laurel Scott with Fort Saskatchewan RCMP. It’s not known if the woman was working alone at the time. \nTwo youths aged 14 and 15 are facing attempted murder charges. RCMP said after the assault, the teens got away in a truck stolen from the ranch and were on the loose for several hours until one of them turned himself in to Edmonton police Sunday evening. The second suspect was arrested in Edmonton at around 8:20 p.m. \nREAD MORE: 2 teens arrested and charged with attempted murder in assault near Edmonton \nO’Malley said she doesn’t know which employee was attacked, nor the kids involved, but said she was shocked when she heard the news. \n“I never really thought any of the youth would have gone that far. They weren’t threatening or anything so it’s pretty surprising. It’s devastating too because I know the staff.” \nThe youth at the facility are “overall really good kids,” O’Malley said. But RCMP would be called almost every day because a resident had walked away or been aggressive with staff, or because of property damage, she added. \nThe Elk Island Child and Youth Ranch offers an intensive treatment program for children and youth covered by the province’s Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act. The facility treats children as young as 10. The ranch has four properties on 142 acres and has a 16-bed capacity. \nThe youth, who remain in custody, are also charged with theft of a vehicle, breach of probation and breach of recognizance. \nScott said a weapon was used in the assault, but would not release any further information. A representative from STARS said the woman was stabbed with a knife. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T06:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T01:28:21.214+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
