The deal envisages 40 firing units and around 200 missiles. \n\nIndia is Israel's largest buyer of military hardware and the latter has been supplying various weapons systems, missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles over the last few years but the transactions have largely remained behind the curtains. \n\nIsraeli President Reuven Rivlin had visited India in November during which both sides had decided to \"broadbase\" their already close defence partnership. \n\nEarlier this week, the director of Israel's Defense Export Controls Agency , a division of the Defense Ministry , had conveyed to some Israeli lawmakers that the country had planned to relax its regulations on export of arms and defence equipment.
