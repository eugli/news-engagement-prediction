(Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY)\n5902 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 119 COMMENT EMAIL MORE LGBT proponents in the entertainment world are using social media to register their disappointment about Wednesday's decision to roll back federal protection for transgender students granted under the Obama administration. Now it will be up to states to decide whether trans students may use the restroom that matches their chosen gender rather than their birth gender.\nAt least that will be the case until April, when the case of Gavin Grimm , a Virginia high school student who identifies as male, comes before the Supreme Court. Should the high court rule in his favor, it could set a national standard for trans rights. (His case is the one that Laverne Cox, transgender star of Netflix's Orange Is the New Black and CBS' Doubt , urged Grammy Awards viewers to research.)\nPerhaps the most notable entry was from Jackie Evancho, the America's Got Talent runner-up who sang the national anthem at President Trump's inauguration last month. This issue is deeply personal for her: Her older sister Juliet came out as trans in 2015 .\n\"I am obviously disappointed in the @POTUS decision to send the #transgender bathroom issue to the states to decide,\" she acknowledged on Twitter , before addressing the Trump directly with a plea: \"U gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration. Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #Transgender rights.\"\n. @realDonaldTrump u gave me the honor 2 sing at your inauguration. Pls give me & my sis the honor 2 meet with u 2 talk #transgender rghts ❤\n— jackie evancho (@jackieevancho) February 23, 2017 Trans rights are also near and dear to Oscar winner Patricia Arquette , whose sister Alexis transitioned nearly two decades ago and who died last September.\nShe took the \"fight fear with jokes\" approach, noting, \"I spent half my life sharing a bathroom with a #Transgender sister. Trust me there's nothing to be afraid of other than running out of TP.\"\nI spent half my life sharing a bathroom with a #Transgender sister. Trust me there's nothing to be afraid of other than running out of TP.\n— Patricia Arquette (@PattyArquette) February 21, 2017 Talk-show host Ellen DeGeneres , who recently disinvited gospel singer Kim Burrell over homophobic comments , wrote, \"This isn’t about politics. It’s about human rights, and it’s not okay.\"\nJust seeing the news about removing laws protecting trans people. This isn’t about politics. It’s about human rights, and it’s not okay.\n— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) February 23, 2017 Captain America star Chris Evans sought to reassure the LGBTQ community, writing, \"I'm sorry for the message that was sent today. They don't don't speak for all of us. We love you.\"\nTo the LGBTQ community, I'm sorry for the message that was sent today. They don't speak for all of us. We love you.\n— Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) February 23, 2017 And Lost alumnus Dominic Monaghan lamented that life for transgender kids is about to get even rougher. \"As if school life isn't hard enough at times for #transgender students @realDonaldTrump takes away rights for separate bathrooms. Heartless.\"\nAs if school life isn't hard enough at times for #transgender students @realDonaldTrump takes away rights for separate bathrooms. Heartless.\n— Dominic Monaghan.
