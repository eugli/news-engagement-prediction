The book, “Two Paths: America Divided or United,” is expected to draw a contrast between Kasich’s view for America and the rhetoric and policies of President Donald Trump, as the Washington Post reported. The book, which will both be a memoir and a call to action, will be published April 25 by the Thomas Dunne Books imprint of St. Martin’s Press.\n“We've got to recognize that the very real problems facing this country cannot be ignored,” Kasich writes, according to an excerpt of the book obtained by the Post . “We cannot be confused or distracted by bitterness and rancor. We cannot allow exclusion to take the place of inclusion.”\nDuring the campaign, Kasich positioned himself as a more optimistic, positive Republican alternative to Trump. Kasich did not support Trump’s candidacy during the general election, instead writing in John McCain.\n“We must hold fast to our principles as a society, because without them we're lost,” he writes. “The way forward is to focus on our shared moral compass — the one that points us to honesty, integrity, personal responsibility, faith, humility, compassion, forgiveness, tolerance — that will get us back on track.”", "external_links": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/01/31/kasich-to-publish-two-paths-a-book-offering-a-contrast-to-trumps-america/?utm_term=.fdc27793025c"], "published": "2017-01-31T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:45:20.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
