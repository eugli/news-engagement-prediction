CNN and all the other networks were racing to give him as much airtime as they could possibly give him,” Morgan said. “And then when the moment came that they thought, ‘Oh, god, hang on, he might actually win,’ they’re rather like Dr. Frankenstein — they thought, ‘We’ve got to kill him off.'” \nMorgan said he noticed the toxic relationship gradually getting worse over the last several months of the campaign, citing the New York Times’ treatment of Trump specifically: “It got more and more virulent. Papers like the New York Times, frankly, I thought were a complete disgrace. They weren’t even pretending to be anything but in the tank for Hillary Clinton.” \nHe told Carlson that he believes the reaction from the Times over Trump’s treatment of the media is insincere and hypocritical. “It’s pretty rich, I think, given the way that they themselves conducted themselves as the supposed paper of record,” he said. \nWhile adding that he does think there is fault on both sides, Morgan said it is up to the media to start mending the relationship: \nI think that it is dangerous and toxic, and I think the media have got to start showing President Trump a bit more respect, and he in turn, and his White House operations, have got to show the media a bit more respect. And they’ve all got to move on. \nMorgan also had some words for people who are still protesting Trump’s win. \n“If somebody wins, they win. You have to accept they have won. You have to stop the squealing, the wailing, the teeth gnashing,” Morgan said. He added that the protesting is similar to what he has experienced in Britain after the Brexit vote. “What we’re seeing in Britain, just as we’re seeing in America, is just one of the great hissy fits of modern political times.” \n“I am appalled by the behavior of so many liberals right now,” Morgan added. “They bang on about tolerance, about fairness, and yet they’re behaving exactly the same way that they warned us all that Donald Trump’s supporters would behave if and when, as they assumed, he lost.” \nMorgan concluded his thoughts with a message to the left: “If you want to try and beat Donald Trump, then do it democratically. Stop trying to delegitimize him. And just try and apply some rational political common sense to defeating your opponent.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T21:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T16:25:50.513+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
