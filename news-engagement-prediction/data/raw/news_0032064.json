On Monday, the 25-year-old, who recently took over as Chief Creative Officer of Playboy, released a statement via Twitter saying that the magazine made a mistake by removing nudity in the first place.\n\"When you have a company, and the founder is responsible for kickstarting the sexual revolution, and then you pluck out the aspect of the company's DNA by removing nudity, it makes a lot of people, including me, sit and say - what the hell is the company doing?\" Hefner said in an interview with Business Insider.\nThe magazine made the executive decision to no longer feature images of nude women in their pages in February 2015, but Cooper publicly disagreed with the decision and said, “I didn’t agree with the decision because I felt as though millennials and Gen-Y didn’t view nudity as the issue. The issue was the way in which nudity and the girls were portrayed.\"\nThe younger Hefner admitted to taking a back seat after disagreeing with the previous nudity decision, but since taking his new position, Hefner is using his new power to bring the magazine back to the form that made it famous. The new issue even features the title \"Naked Is Normal,\" which has also turned into a social-media hashtag. Playboy 's Twitter account poked fun at the no-nudity policy by placing white T-shirts over famous nude works of art.\n3 #NakedIsNormal #AdamandEve pic.twitter.com/0fp50IFTnH\n— Playboy (@Playboy) February 10, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 5 #NakedIsNormal #PabloPicasso pic.twitter.com/fB0PbUBjCO\n— Playboy (@Playboy) February 8, 2017 7 #NakedIsNormal #SandroBotticelli pic.twitter.com/c4ozRjvgQJ\n— Playboy (@Playboy) February 6, 2017 The March/April issue of Playboy will hit stands on February 28th.
