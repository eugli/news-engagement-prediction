Here’s a look at heroines who’ve attempted action roles in Bollywood films before her. bollywood Updated: Feb 23, 2017 13:02 IST HT Correspondent Hindustan Times Rangoon may not be an action film, but Kangana Ranaut plays an action heroine in the Vishal Bhardwaj’s film that also stars Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan. \nThe buzz around Kangana Ranaut’s Rangoon, which also stars Shahid Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan, is growing louder as the film readies for a release on February 24. While her role as an action heroine in the Vishal Bhardwaj film is generating a lot of interest, this is not the first time female actors have taken up roles that require them to perform action sequences. Remember Rekha in Khoon Bhari Maang (1988) or Hema Malini in Andha Kanoon (1983)? Rekha in a still from Khoon Bhari Maang. \nMore recently, Deepika Padukone made her Hollywood debut with the action-packed international hit xXx: Return of the Xander Cage. \nHere’s a look at female actors who dared to cast themselves in roles that required them to perform action sequences: \nKangana Ranaut \nRangoon, one of Kangana Ranaut’s most anticipated films, is a period film set in the World War II. \nThe film portrays the struggles and life of Mary Ann Evans: The buzz is that it is loosely based on the ’40s action star Fearless Nadia. Rumours suggest that Kangana will be seen performing the action scenes on her own without a body double in the film. \nTaapsee Pannu \nTaapsee played an undercover agent in the Akshay Kumar-starrer Baby where she left a powerful impact with a small but effective combat scene opposite Sushant Singh. Taapsee is now gearing up for the release of Naam Shabana, a prequel to Baby. \nShe will be seen doing some action sequences that are reportedly new to Bollywood. Taapsee has trained extensively with French stunt director Cyril Raffaeli, known for his work in blockbuster movies including The Incredible Hulk, Brotherhood of the Wolf, The Transformers. \nKriti Sanon \nKriti Sanon will soon be seen with Sushant Singh Rajput in Raabta. While the film is a romantic flick, Kriti will do an action sequence. Reports suggest that she bruised herself while performing the stunts on sets. \nKatrina Kaif \nTiger Zinda Hai is set to release towards the end of 2017. The film will see Katrina Kaif and Salman Khan reunite for their sequel to Ek Tha Tiger. Katrina was seen throwing in some kicks and punches in that movie as a Pakistani spy in the 2012 film. We hope she will be in action mode for Tiger Zinda Hai as well. \nDeepika Padukone \nDeepika was seen performing action in two of her old releases, Chandni Chowk to China, where she flaunted her sword-fighting skills, and in Bajirao Mastani, where she reportedly shot the war scene wearing a 20kg-heavy armour. She was recently seen throwing punches and kicks in the hit xXx along with Hollywood star Vin Diesel. \nFollow @htshowbiz for more ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:27:27.981+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
