On Slot to 247Sports Links \nHENDERSON, Nev. – The Pylon 7on7 National Championship remains one of the most densely populated venues for college football talent in every recruiting cycle. On Saturday, the 2017 edition of the event kicked off and some of the highest rated players in America are already proving their worth, while others quickly placed themselves on the national radar. Dorian Thompson-Robinson (Photo: Keith Niebuhr , 247Sports) \nWith more than 170 teams in attendance, it's impossible to put together a comprehensive top performers piece so after one day of action, these were what we'll call the eye-catchers from Saturday's pool play. \nQuarterbacks \nWashington commit Jacob Sirmon absolutely looked the part on Saturday, showcasing big size a big arm and total command of his squad. His day one showing looked like it should have given his five-star ranking per the 247Sports Composite. \nWhile he didn't have the best outing in the game I watched of his, it was clear that Bishop Gorman's Dorian Thompson-Robinson is one of the elite talents in the country at quarterback. He'll be a first year starter as a senior after playing behind Army All-American Tate Martell but Thompson-Robinson has a huge arm, a really quick delivery and he's very comfortable in a leadership role. \nThe sleeper at the quarterback spot was Tyler Shough out of Chandler (Ariz.) Hamilton. Currently with offers from Columbia, Harvard, Hawaii and Western Kentucky, don't be surprised if Shough has 20 offers by the summer. He's that talented. \nPass-catchers \nOne of the favorites heading into the tournament portion of the weekend will be Texas Elite due in part to Drue Jackson's efforts at wide receiver. The big, athletic, tough pass-catcher made some critical catches to win some tight games on Saturday, helping his team go undefeated on day one. Wisconsin and Utah are among his favorites but watch out for Tennessee if the Vols pull the trigger on an offer. \nThough he's young, Gee Scott Jr. made an impression on Saturday. The class of 2020 prospect is big, fluid and athletic at wide receiver. He already looks like a savvy veteran as a route-runner and he makes veteran plays in traffic as a catcher too. \nIn yet another event, Mark Pope flashed. The Miami (Fla.) Southridge product looks like a Calvin Ridley clone due to his fluidity as a route-runner, his effortless ball-skills and his body control. He had multiple long touchdowns in three games. Miami remains the favorite in this recruitment. \nHe could project to safety just as easily as wide receiver but Bryan Addison out of Gardena (Calif.) Junipero Serra flashed in a big way on Saturday. He's listed at 6-foot-3 but that may actually be a modest measurement. The two-way standout has freakish length and moves really well at that size. USC and Oklahoma are among his offers. \nThe defenders \nFor a 7on7 event, there were a lot of linebackers that made their presence felt on Saturday. Among them, Maninoa Tufono was one of the more intriguing. A class of 2019 prospect, Tufono is strikingly athletic in space for a bigger inside linebacker. Already he's landed offers from the likes of Oregon and Washington State. With a father that played football at Washington, an offer from the Huskies would be a big one. \nA linebacker even younger that really popped on Saturday was Justin Flowe out of Upland (Calif.) High School. Flowe is a 6-2, 200-pounder out of the class of 2020 and he recently landed his first offer from UCLA. He was playing middle linebacker for his Ground Zero squad and was making all kinds of impact as a rare physical body that could operate effectively in space. \nAt defensive back, I’m not sure there was a cornerback that I was more impresse with than Kyler Gordon out of Everett (Wash.) Archbishop Murray. Gordon isn't overly long but he is really active, has great reactive quickness, instincts and the type of body control to make plays on the football in the air. Notre Dame is one of his most recent offers. \nAt 5-foot-9, Deshawn Ruffin is also not of the ideal height but he sure does play with natural defensive back instincts. Ruffin also has outstanding makeup speed and acceleration. He recently landed his first offer from Nevada and that should open the door for more to come calling for the Fresno native. \nOut of the class of 2019, Darien Chase was an unknown to me before this event but he was outstanding on Saturday. On both sides of the ball, Chase showed explosiveness, high point ability and a great competitive nature. He's out of Mountain View High School in Washington and looks like a major steal in the making. \nTwo four-stars at the safety position lived up to their ranking in Ohio State commit Jaiden Woodbey and Fresno (Calif.) Edison's Steve Stephens . Woodbey in particular showed the ability to lock up elite wide receivers at corner despite having the kind of size that could allow him to grow into a linebacker. Meanwhile Stephens showed ballhawking skills and downhill acceleration that was unique. \nOne more safety that also showed some playmaking ability was Kenny Churchwell out of Phoenix (Ariz.) Mountain Pointe. He holds offers from Arizona and Hawaii but looks capable of adding a lot more in the coming months.
