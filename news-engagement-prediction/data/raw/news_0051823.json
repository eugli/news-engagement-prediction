Shah Rukh Khan proved his acting mettle on the small screen before he hit the jackpot in Bollywood. By Vandana.Srivastawa | Updated: February 20, 2017 11:27 AM IST Comments \nShah Rukh Khan is all set to return to Indian television serials as a talk show host on Star Plus. The new show is one of the biggest projects of Star India and is titled, ‘TED Talks India: Nayi Soch’. The talk show will feature speakers sharing big ideas in TED’s signature format of short presentations of 18 minutes or less and will be broadcasted on Star Plus. Shah Rukh Khan will host the show and introduce the speakers along with engaging them in conversations the way TED CEO Chris Anderson does. The series seems to be a niche show. \nShah Rukh Khan has hosted a number of shows on Television and he started his acting career with TV serials way back in the early 90s. Shah Rukh Khan is a common fixture in hosting Indian Award shows like Filmfare, Screen and Zee Cine Awards. He also stepped into Amitabh Bachchan’s shoes for one season as the host of Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of Who wants to Be a Millionaire? He also hosted Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?, the Indian version of Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? But all these TV Shows he did when he became the indisputable king of Bollywood and people started following and emulating his every action. Fauji and Circus are the two well known serials. Circus is making a comeback on the small screen from February 19 at 8 pm on Doordarshan. Renuka Shahane who starred alongside Shah Rukh Khan was overjoyed with the announcement.
