The figures were obtained by the BBC’s Radio 4’s File on 4 documentary through Freedom of Information requests to local councils across the UK. But the data also revealed that very few of the carers responsible were held to account. There have been only 15 prosecutions in the last three years and police only investigated 700 alerts in the last three years. Michael King, Local Government Ombudsman said: ‘What we see is just the tip of the iceberg. We see a whole range of complaints; failure to look after people’s personal care needs, helping them with eating, with their own hygiene, helping them with medication, all sorts of day to day tasks that people should be getting help with.’ Gary Fitzgerald, from the charity Action on Elder Abuse, said: ‘The overwhelming majority of abuse is criminal in nature and never gets prosecuted. ‘It gets social worked but it doesn’t get prosecuted. If there’s an investigation, rarely will the police be involved. If the police are involved, they don’t actually want to upset that old person, so they won’t prosecute. ‘So you might get a police caution if you’re lucky or there might be no prosecution at all.’ Last September shocking footage emerged of 86-year-old Dora Melton being slapped and restrained at her home in Peterborough by carer Maurice Campbell. The abuse was caught on CCTV by her daughter Elizabeth Budnik who had become suspicious. Campbell and his wife Deborah - who had also been contracted to care for Mrs Melton - were sentenced to 28 months and 38 weeks in jail respectively. Bridget Warr, chief executive of the UK Home Care Association , which represents home care providers said: ‘I think that the challenges of too little money in the system from Government, through local authorities to providers - and indeed to workers absolutely needs to be investigated and put right.” The programme spoke to the family of 86 year old dementia sufferer Dora Melton who was abused in her own home. Speaking for the first time Mrs Melton’s daughter Elizabeth Budnik told the BBC how she uncovered the abuse after putting in CCTV and saw carer Maurice Campbell violently restraining her mother. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘The abuse of people who depend on care services in their own homes is completely unacceptable, and we are determined to stamp it out.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T08:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T04:37:11.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
