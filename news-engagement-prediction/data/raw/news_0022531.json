Todd Gurley (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:23 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:23 p.m. ET \nTodd Gurley had two position coaches in two seasons. He didn't want the make it three in as many years. \nAfter the Rams announced Sean McVay as their new head coach last month, the Rams running back reached out to McVay asking him to retain running backs coach Skip Peete on his coaching staff. \n\"It was one of those situations when you go into these interviews where you have your projected staff in place,\" McVay told reporters Friday during a news conference to introduce his coaching staff. \"Skip was a guy that I heard a lot of really good things about, I had never had the chance to work with him before, but he had worked with a couple of people that I’ve worked with that I hold their opinion in high regard. He was a guy I was interested to sit down with and wanted to really get a chance to talk some football, learn what he’s about.\" \nMORE: Gurley critical of Rams inept offense \nBefore he could do that, however, McVay received a phone call and text from Gurley, who vouched for Peete. \n\"It was one of those deals where I got a chance to talk to Todd and he kind of explained some of the reasons why he felt so strongly about Coach Peete,\" McVay said. \"When you’ve got a key player like that, I think you want to be able to try to demonstrate that you’re going to listen to your players, their opinion matters. And somebody of his caliber and the type of guy that he is, very important to us. And that definitely played a factor in why we were able to retain Coach Peete. He also earned the opportunity because of what he has done as a great coach, as well. \n\"He felt like, from a technique, fundamentals, understanding the position, allowing him to see the big picture, how does he fit with regards to protections. I know, last year, he was used a lot more in protections on some of those third-down situations where you’re responsible for blitz pickups and things of that nature. And I think that’s what allowed him to, kind of, expand his game and continue to try to be that every down back that I know he’s striving to be. It was just a lot of the things you’re looking for with your coaching staff and what they’re trying to represent. I feel like Todd saw a lot of those things and that was why he wanted to get a chance to continue to work with him.\" \nIt would have been understandable if McVay wanted to make a change. Following an outstanding rookie season in which Gurley ran for 1,106 yards and 10 touchdowns in just 13 games to win NFL rookie of the year honors, Gurley had just 885 yards and six scores in 2016 without missing a game. Peete had replaced Ben Sirmans, who left following the 2015 season to take the same position with the Packers. \nDespite Gurley's struggles during a 4-12 season that saw head coach Jeff Fisher get fired with three games remaining, he believed he had a good working relationship with Peete. \nPeete said Friday he and Gurley had \"a lot of conversations and spent a lot of time together.\" \n\"I think the communication between the player and the coach is big,\" Peete added. \"In order to have a successful running game, it’s a combination of everyone. It’s not just, ‘well the line didn’t block good,’ it wasn’t like ‘the runner didn’t run good — it’s a combination of both. I think everybody has to be cohesive and be on the same page.\" \nMcVay, who celebrated his 31st birthday on Jan. 24 and is the youngest head coach in NFL history, echoed the sentiment of getting everyone \"on the same page.\" \n\"What you see in Todd is a special player,\" McVay said. \"He’s got great gifts as far as just a talented runner with natural instincts, ability when he gets to the second level to make people miss kind of seamlessly. We’re looking to get him to be that player consistently week in and week out. \n\"From what I’ve seen so far, really excited about the opportunity to work with him. We feel confident that he’ll get going and be special back for a long time in this league.\" Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T08:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T03:35:35.101+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
