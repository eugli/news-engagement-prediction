He came out with props. When you come out with props, you get props,” the Fist Fight star said. \nMark Grist has gone viral before as a result of his Don’t Flop rap battle versus Blizzard, strategically titled “Student vs Teacher Rap Battle” when it was first posted to YouTube. \nHarry Baker, on the other hand, is well known for his slam poetry and has even given a TedX Talk, which featured some of his work.
