Picture: Economist.com Source: Supplied \nBy comparison, the United States — home to the glittering punters’ paradise of Las Vegas — lost less than half that amount.\n“To the general public, Australia hardly leaps to mind as a gambling hotbed, yet industry insiders know it is far and away their most lucrative market,” the Economist reported. \nIts analysis is based on data from H2 Gambling Capital (H2G), a consultancy, which found that Australia’s betting losses per resident adult were “about double the average in other Western countries”.\nAnd the reason? Pokie machines.\nThe losses from the ubiquitous gaming machines found in pubs and clubs across the nation are bigger than the total per capita gambling losses of nearly every other country represented — largely because of Australia’s permissive bet limit rules, which allow punters to lose up to $1498 ($US1150) an hour.\ndana.mccauley@news.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T00:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:29:17.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
