Los Angelenos spend an average of 104 hours in congested traffic a week, according to Inrix, a transportation analytics firm. This number tops Moscow at 91, and in third place, New York City at 89 total congested traffic hours.\nMedia: Brandpoint While Houston isn't ranked particularly well on the list; at least it's not among the worst of the worst.\nLooking at these ratings and knowing that there are a host of cities (we're looking at you Dallas) with commuters more miserable than Houstonians might feel therapeutic.\nThe Bayou City saw similar results on a recent ranking from TomTom , which noted that Houstonians actually spent slightly less time in congestion than 2015. Dug Begley delved into why in this piece on HoustonChronicle.com .\nSTAYING DRY: Houston streets that are prone to flooding, high water\nClick through above to see which cities have the most congestion issues.\nPhoto: Victor Decolongon, Getty Image 1 of / 26 Caption\nClose\nImage 1 of 26 1.
