However, it is not for a film but a commercial. The setting of this advertisement for a jewelry brand is a proposal scene which has an eerie similarity with the proposal scene featuring Saif Ali Khan and Preity Zinta in Nikhil Advani's 2003 romantic drama, Kal Ho Naa Ho . \nReleased on Valentine's Day, the commercial aptly captures the nervous excitement that a boy harbours before proposing to his girl. It also throws light on the fact that the two may not be on the same page as they are carrying the baggage of work and tiffs with friends. However, it equally focuses on rising above the trivialities and preserving special moments for life. \nMalhotra and Priyanka share an easy chemistry on the screen which is why it will be even more exciting to see them grace the silver screen together. He has previously worked with Priyanka's cousin Parineeti Chopra in Vinil Mathew's 2014 romantic comedy Hasee Toh Phasee and they looked adorable together. \nDeccan Chronicle reports that the commercial is produced by Dharma 2.0, the new advertising branch of Dharma Productions, helmed by filmmaker Karan Johar. After distributing films like the Baahubali franchise and The Lunchbox , Johar is now also venturing into the realm of advertising with his content-driven commercials. \nPunit Malhotra, Johar's former Assistant Director, has directed the commercial featuring Malhotra and Priyanka. He took to Twitter at the time of the shoot to share a picture of the two actors and left the fans guessing. Two gorgeous stars shot for Dharma 2.0 last night. Guess who? Fun stuff coming your way!  #freshpair #dharma2 .0 #shootlife pic.twitter.com/UY1BaxAy9R \n— Punit Malhotra (@punitdmalhotra) December 23, 2016 \nHe also tweeted a picture of the two actors posing with his fellow filmmaker Shakun Batra. Batra has directed Malhotra in his family drama from last year, Kapoor and Sons . Given the comfort these two actors share on the screen, it will not be a surprise if Johar signs them together for a feature film.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T13:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T08:47:42.694+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
