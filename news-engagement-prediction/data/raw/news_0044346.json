Prosecutors had demanded a sentence of between three and five years, while Azaria himself had asked the court to be “merciful” and sentence him to open detention.\nThe shooting on 24 March last year, captured on video by a Palestinian human rights activist , showed Azaria, 21, killing the badly wounded and immobile Abdul Fatah al-Sharif.\nIsraeli soldier is filmed shooting dead wounded Palestinian attacker Read more \nPresiding judge Maya Heller said the judges had found that Azaria’s actions had seriously harmed the values of Israeli society as a whole, as well as violating the “purity of arms” of the Israeli military’s ethical code.\nThe killing, which made international headlines, took place as other soldiers walked around the wounded Sharif, who had already been shot and badly injured during a knife attack on Israeli soldiers near a checkpoint in the West Bank city of Hebron. \nIntense interest in the case was fuelled in part by it being a rare instance of an Israeli serviceman being charged for violence against a Palestinian , and it was seen as a test of Israeli military justice.\nPassing the sentence, which Israeli media commentators described as lenient, the court said Azaria had not expressed regret for his crime, though it noted that his army record had been unblemished up until the shooting and that his arrest had caused his family deep distress. \nThe sentence is unlikely to end the affair, as Azaria’s legal team had already pledged to appeal against the guilty verdict. The soldier’s legal team on Tuesday asked for the beginning of the jail sentence to be postponed until an appeal could be heard. \nAs Azaria arrived at the court with family members before the sentencing, his father Charlie asked supporters, who came to protest at the hearing, to remain calm. \nInitially prosecutors had called for Azaria to be charged with murder, but instead settled on a lesser charge of manslaughter, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. \nLast month’s conviction deeply divided Israel , where military service is compulsory and support for young soldiers is widespread.\nThe verdict against Azaria was seen as a victory for commanders seeking to preserve a code of ethics.\nA number of prominent Israeli politicians, including the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, have called for Azaria to be pardoned . Immediately after the guilty verdict, education minister and far-right Jewish Home leader Naftali Bennett described the trial as politically “contaminated from the beginning”.\nThe discussion at the heart of the case was whether Azaria was justified in killing Sharif; judges ruled last month he had acted unlawfully.\nProsecutors argued Azaria’s motive was expressed in comments overheard by witnesses: that Sharif “deserved to die” for wounding a comrade. The court accepted this account, noting that the words carried “serious significance” in its ruling.\nHuman Rights Watch said: “Sending Elor Azaria to prison for his crime sends an important message about reigning in excessive use of force.\n“But senior Israeli officials should also repudiate the shoot-to-kill rhetoric that too many of them have promoted, even when there is no imminent threat of death. Pardoning Azaria or reducing his punishment would only encourage impunity for unlawfully taking the life of another person.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:42:15.385+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
