His jaw had to be wired shut as he recovers from the punch from Myers, with a recovery timeline expected to take six to eight weeks. \nHis fellow teammates originally told police that Pirovic fell in the shower. \nTwo days after the incident, Pirovic provided a written statement to the police acknowledging how the injury occurred, but stated he had no intentions of pressing charges on his teammate. \nThe school handed down a suspension to all five players with knowledge of the incident, which held them out of two games last week. Ilija Stojiljkovic, Jaquan McKennon and Dusan Majstorovic -- all players who were indirectly involved -- were reinstated on Wednesday. Myers, the team’s leading scorer, remains suspended. \n“I’m obviously very disappointed,” coach Bob Walsh said Thursday via a prepared statement, according to the Press Herald . “It’s not good and there’s an obviously negative effect, short term. But I don’t think it’s reflective of who we are or the kids we have. Our guys will certainly learn from this.” \nPirovic’s timeline for healing will likely keep him out for the rest of the season. The Black Bears (6-24) roll into their final regular season game on Saturday against Binghamton.
