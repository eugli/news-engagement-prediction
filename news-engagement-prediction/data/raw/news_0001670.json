It's unclear whether they are also there to give him tactical advice. \nIt's not certainly not ideal for Wenger, who had an interesting experience a couple of years back in the stands at Old Trafford. \nThe former Monaco boss famously booted a plastic bottle after seeing his side's goal chalked off for offside and then had to stand in the middle of a group of United fans. \nRelive that memorable moment with Gordon Strachan's brilliant narration here:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T22:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T18:01:45.928+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
