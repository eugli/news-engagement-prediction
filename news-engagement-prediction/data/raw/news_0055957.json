ISIS fighters filmed grinning before suicide attack UP NEXT VIDEO Footage shared on twitter shows ISIS fighters smiling before blowing themselves up southwest of Mosul. Source: Twitter/ Chris Tomson ISIS fighters filmed grinning before suicide attack \nThe UK fighter who IS claimed detonated a suicide bomb against Iraqi forces outside Mosul was named in British media as Jamal al-Harith, who was reportedly detained at the United States base between 2002 and 2004. \nBefore he converted to Islam in his 20s, the militant was reportedly known as Ronald Fiddler. \nHe later went by the name Jamal al-Harith before he changed it again to al-Britani, the suffix indicating his country of origin in a practice used by other foreign fighters who have sworn their allegiance to IS. Smiling suicide bomber identified as Jamal al-Harith was reportedly a former detainee in the US military prison in Guantanamo Bay. \nAn image released by IS and published on Monday by the SITE Intelligence Group was confirmed as al-Harith by his brother Leon Jameson. \n\"It is him, I can tell by his smile. If it is true then I've lost a brother, so another family [member] gone,\" Jameson told The Times. \nFollowing his detention in Guantanamo Bay, al-Harith was paid more than one million pounds in compensation by the Blair government, according to the Daily Mail. Ronald Fiddler was reportedly paid one million pounds by the UK government, according to Daily Mail. \nChannel 4 News cited an unnamed family member and another anonymous source as confirming Harith was pictured in the IS image. \nThe photograph shows him smiling, dressed in camouflage clothing and appearing to be seated in a vehicle with wires and switches in the background. \nThe British government said it could not verify the reports, or responded to the allegations of the paid compensation.
