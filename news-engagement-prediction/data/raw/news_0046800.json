What can save our prisons from chaos? The governors | John Podmore Read more \nThe pay boosts will vary depending on how acute the recruitment difficulties are at the jail in question. \nStaff at 31 establishments including Pentonville, Wormwood Scrubs and Belmarsh will see their annual pay increase by £3,000-£5,000. New recruits will also receive higher starting salaries of up to £29,500 – a rise of £5,000 on the current level. \nTruss said: “Prison officers do a challenging and demanding job day in and day out. I want frontline staff to know that their work, experience and loyal service is valued. We also want to attract the best new talent into the service, ensuring we recruit and retain the leaders of the future. \n“These hardworking, dedicated staff are key to delivering our ambitious reform agenda, and it is right that we offer them greater support as we move ever closer to transforming prisons into places of safety and reform.” \nThe move comes weeks after Truss announced a national recruitment drive to add 2,500 officers as part of her wide-ranging agenda. \nDwindling staffing levels have been highlighted as assaults, self-harm and suicides all soared to record levels, and there has been a spate of major disturbances in jails. \nOn Thursday official figures revealed the number of personnel in key operational roles in public sector prisons in England and Wales fell by more than 300 to 17,888 last year. \nThe leaving rate – the percentage of staff with a permanent contract of employment who left for reasons other than voluntary early departure schemes and redundancy – has almost doubled since 2012-13. \nAs well as the announcement on pay, the Ministry of Justice said thousands of new learning and development opportunities will be made available to staff nationwide. They will also be given specialist training in mental health and self-harm prevention.
