(Photo: Katie Jones with Blue Blanket Images) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCALEDONIA, Ill. â€” Just one month after Amber Rangel returned from her scuba diving trip in Honduras, she began preparing for her next diving adventure, this time in Iceland. \nThese days, there's a bit more exertion needed for her to travel. Rangel is a quadriplegic, with only limited movement in her arms. She relies on a power wheelchair to get around. But she's determined to keep pushing her limits. \nA couple years ago, Rangel was a world-class barefoot water skier. She was training for the national championships when she had a life-altering accident. She hit her head on a jump going 43 mph. \nDoctors told her she had a C5 spinal cord injury. Rangel was paralyzed from the chest down, with limited movement in her arms. Even with the diagnosis, Rangel kept a positive attitude. She knew she'd get back to the water. \n\"I've never really been someone to let something take me down before,\" Rangel said. \"I guess it's in my character to not let it change me.\" \nThat's when Rangel learned about Diveheart, a nonprofit group that helps people with physical and cognitive disabilities go scuba diving. Diving helps build independence and confidence, according to Diveheart Executive Director Tinamarie Hernandez. \nAfter months of physical therapy and scuba-diving training, Rangel became certified to dive. She's dived in Mexico and Honduras and is now looking forward to a dive in Iceland. \nEven though her paralysis hasn't changed her thrill for water sports and an active lifestyle, it has allowed her to appreciate everything she's been able to accomplish. \n\"She's finding herself again, in being able to dive and travel,\" Hernandez said. \nIt's even more satisfying knowing some people didn't think she'd be able to do it. \n\"That's what it's all about,\" Rangel said. \nFor more inspiring stories, LIKE the Humankind Facebook page.
