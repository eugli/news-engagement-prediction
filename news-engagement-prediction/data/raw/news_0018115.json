Andy Nguyen confirms the boy walked away from Ecole Terre Des Jeunes school in the 3700 block of 42 St NW, in the community of Varsity, after being excused from class to use the washroom.\nDuring the disappearance, school officials enacted security safeguards, including a 'keep and secure' policy for the children in the school's daycare, under the advisement of the Calgary Police Service.\nThe missing child was located after approximately four and a half hours. The boy was wearing a jacket and boots but investigators have not confirmed where the child had been during his disappearance. On Tuesday afternoon, the temperature dropped below -25C.\nMore than 20 CPS members, including K-9 and HAWCS, assisted in the search.
