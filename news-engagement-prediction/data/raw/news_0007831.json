It’s there,” the statement concluded. \nRosemary K. Young, senior director of marketing at Ivanka Trump, also explained to Refinery29 that the brand is doing well, despite recent reports. \n“The Ivanka Trump brand continues to expand across categories and distribution with increased customer support, leading us to experience significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016. We believe that the strength of a brand is measured not only by the profits it generates, but the integrity it maintains,” Young said. \nNordstrom, which has carried items by Ivanka Trump since 2011, said on Thursday that it would stop selling the first daughter’s brand this season due to performance. \n“We’ve said all along we make buying decisions based on performance,” a Nordstrom spokeswoman told Fortune i n an emailed statement. “In this case, based on the brand’s performance, we’ve decided not to buy it for this season.” \nThe retailer also responded to the criticism on Twitter , saying: “We hope that offering a vendor’s products isn’t misunderstood as us taking a political position; we’re not. Our customers can make choices about what they purchase based on personal views & we’ll continue to give them options.” \nOn Nordstrom.com , only four Ivanka Trump shoes remain (on 40 percent discount). In addition, the website shows that the brand has been removed from the listed designers. \nAlso on Thursday, Neiman Marcus ‘ website removed more than a dozen jewelry and accessory items by Ms. Trump. \nBoth Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus are targeted by protest group Grab Your Wallet, which boycotts companies either owned by the Trumps, that carry Trump-branded clothing and accessories, or that have offered financial support to President Donald Trump ’s political campaign.
