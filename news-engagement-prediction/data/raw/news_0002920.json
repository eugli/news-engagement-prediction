What South Africa leaving the ICC would mean \nThe AU took the decision on Tuesday following a divisive debate at its annual heads of state of summit in Addis Ababa, the BBC's Emmanuel Igunza reports from Ethiopia's capital. \nPart of the resolution also said the AU would hold talks with the UN Security Council to push for the ICC to be reformed, our correspondent adds. \nSudan's President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the court on charges of genocide in Darfur, was at the summit. \nIn 2015, a South African court criticised President Jacob Zuma's government for failing to arrest Mr Bashir when he attended an AU meeting in the main city, Johannesburg. \nThe government later announced that it was withdrawing from the ICC because it did not want to execute arrest warrants which would lead to \"regime change\". \nA total of 34 African states are signatories to the Rome Statute, which set up the ICC. \nThe ICC and global justice: Came into force in 2002 The Rome Statute that set it up has been ratified by 123 countries, but the US is a notable absence It aims to prosecute and bring to justice those responsible for the worst crimes - genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes Only Africans prosecuted so far", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T18:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T13:43:02.211+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
