Real Madrid celebrate winning the 2016 final – and are tipped to do well again ALAN SHEARER \nWinners: Juventus \nSERIE A winners for the last five years and on their way to six in a row. It would be easy to go for Bayern or one of the Spanish giants but I have a sneaky suspicion the Italians can win it. \nHow far will our sides go . . . \nARSENAL have the ability to beat anyone on their day but you just can’t trust them to turn up. Faced with a challenge like Bayern Munich they could just disappear into their shells. \nKeep up to date with ALL the Champions League gossip and transfers \nLeicester have the stress of a relegation fight and are in no state to face Sevilla — currently the third best team in Spain. \nManchester City will edge it against Monaco but frailty at the back will be their undoing in the quarter-finals. IAN WRIGHT \nWinners: Barcelona \nNOT the most original choice, I know, but when Barca are fit and firing they are the best team around. \nHow far will our sides go . . . \nLEICESTER’S fairy-tale ends against Sevilla in the last 16. The way the Foxes are going, you really couldn’t back them with confidence. 6 \nBut Bayern Munich are in a bad state — off the pitch, at least — and I think Arsenal can finally beat them, and maybe go as far as the last four. \nManchester City are by far England’s best hope. They are starting to look a real decent side, should be too strong for Monaco and could maybe reach the final. DAVE KIDD \nWinners: Barcelona \nTHE Catalans and Real Madrid are comfortably the best two teams in the competiton — and nobody ever retains the trophy in the Champions League era. \nHow far will our sides go . .  . \nALL three English sides will be out in the last 16. \nArsenal are not in the same class as Bayern Munich and Sevilla will be much too strong and savvy for Leicester . Reuters 6 Claudio Ranieri will see Leicester’s dream Euro run end, claims Dave Kidd \nManchester City have a chance but Monaco showed against Spurs in the group stages that they have the measure of England’s leading clubs. I fancy them to nick a win on away goals. THIERRY HENRY \nWinners: Er, not sure \nIT is too difficult to predict. I could go for the usual suspects but it depends on a million things — who is injured, who is in form. Put a gun to my head and I’d say . . . shoot me! \nHow far will our sides go . . . \nTHEY are all in for a ride. Manchester City must be careful of Monaco who have good history against English clubs. In 1998 when I was there we knocked out Manchester United and they also beat Chelsea on their way to the final in 2004. \nFor Arsenal , we know the first knockout round is where they tend to stumble yet Bayern are not having a great season so they could spring a surprise. Getty Images Arsene Wengers Arsenal could take advantage of a mediocre season for Bayern, according to Gunners legend Thierry Henry \nAnd while I would love for Leicester to go through, Sevilla are so strong. DANNY HIGGINBOTHAM \nWinners: Real Madrid \nGOING forward they are so dangerous. Zinedine Zidane’s got them playing very well and on their day you would fancy them against anyone in Europe. \nHow far will our sides go . . . \nI CAN see Manchester City and Leicester both getting to the quarter-finals. \nBayern’s players have more know-how than Arsenal and over the two legs they will be the better team. Getty Images 6 Zinedine Zidane has turned Real into the team to fear, says Danny Higginbotham \nBut I fancy City to beat free-scoring Monaco. Pep Guardiola’ s European experience will be key plus their front three — especially with Gabriel Jesus in there. \nAs for Leicester , I’ve got a funny feeling about them. I just think the Champions League could suit them. \nSevilla will come at them and if Leicester can come away from the away leg with a one-goal deficit they could go through. They are unknown in Europe and could just spring a surprise. RELATED STORIES PREVIEW PSG v Barcelona: What time does the match kick-off, what TV channel is it on, and what is the latest team news?
