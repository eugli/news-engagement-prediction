Click through for a tour. Sprouts Farmers Market Inc. , which will open its first Florida store in Tampa on Wednesday, is one of the most competitive grocers to enter the market in years. Its store in Carrollwood, at 15110 N. Dale Mabry Highway, manages to blend every aspect of mainstream and specialty grocers in one 27,000-square-foot box. The focal point of the store is row after rainbow row of produce — both conventional and organic, with packaged goods pushed to the perimeter of the store. 15 photos Sprouts Farmers Market is almost ready to open in Carrollwood. Click through for a tour. The store is almost ready for its grand opening celebration at 7 a.m., with everything from sausages ground in-store to dairy-free ice creams ready to go. The first customers through the door will receive 20 percent off, and Sprouts has a hashtag, #NewKaleInTown, ready to chronicle the grand opening on social media. Walking through the aisles, it's easy to see why analysts have branded Sprouts a threat to mainstream grocers like Publix Super Markets Inc. , based in Lakeland. Phoenix-based Sprouts targets home cooks with its vast produce selection and bulk spices. But it also has a wide variety of items meant to appeal to time-crunched consumer. Cooked, shredded chicken is sold by the pound; there's also a \"gather and go\" promotion that lets customers pick one hot entree, two side dishes and one loaf of French bread from the prepared foods department, which Sprouts has branded the Market Corner Deli. (The Market Corner offers a direct competitor to the cult favorite Pub sub, with a made-to-order sandwich menu and a rotating $3.99 sandwich special.) Sprouts also doesn't shy away from branding itself as a discount grocer, constantly pushing sales both with a print circular and via a mobile coupon app. It has more than 2,000 private-label products that cover everything from pantry staples to ice cream made with coconut milk to a sriracha ketchup. \"Sprouts is highly promotional,\" said Diego Romero , a Sprouts spokesman who was on-site Tuesday, \"and at any given time, a third of our store is on sale.\" In other words, it's the kind of grocery store where a customer could do all of their shopping — which isn't always the case with specialty grocers. For 2017, Sprouts will be contained to the Tampa Bay region. The grocer has confirmed locations in Sarasota, South Tampa and Palm Harbor, which will open in that order this year. Romero said the company doesn't anticipate announcing any Florida stores outside of the Tampa Bay region before 2018. Each store employs between 120 and 140 employees; the Carrollwood store has hired more than 140, Romero said. Beyond Sprouts, Aldi has also ramped up hiring in the Tampa Bay region in recent months. “Tampa’s a great market for a company like Sprouts because there’s a large population of families and health-minded people,\" he said. \"But also it’s quite diverse, and really our store is attractive to all types of households, whether they’re looking for fresh produce or meat or holistic products.\" The opening of the Carrollwood store caps off more than four years of speculation as to when Sprouts would enter the Florida market. Rumors surfaced in 2013 that the company was looking at sites throughout the state, but in 2014, Sprouts pulled back , telling commercial real estate brokers it would measure the success of stores in metro Atlanta before pursuing Florida expansion.
