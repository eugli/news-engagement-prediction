In January, Merriam-Webster tweeted the definition of \"fact\" following Conway's now-infamous claim that President Trump's inaccurate statements about the inaugural crowd size were \"alternative facts.\" Additionally, the dictionary posted a definition of \"betrayal\" on its website after White House press secretary Sean Spicer used the word to justify the firing of acting Attorney General Sally Yates—and then said \"I'm not going to define the word.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T02:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:24:14.639+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
