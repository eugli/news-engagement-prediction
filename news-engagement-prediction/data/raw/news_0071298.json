ThinkStock DaVita Inc. (NYSE: DVA) has managed to stay out of any significant battles at the Colorado Legislature this year, but the Denver-based kidney-care provider finds itself squarely in the middle of a fight in the California Legislature that company officials say could have a major effect on how they operate clinics in that state. A bill introduced on Feb. 15 would mandate minimum staffing levels at dialysis clinics throughout the nation’s largest state. Seven other states have imposed staffing regulations aimed at dialysis clinics, but none are as stringent or far-reaching as what is proposed in the Dialysis Patient Safety Act, which is set for its first committee hearing next month, said David Maughan , DaVita senior vice president. A dialysis patient receives care at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in North Carolina. ThinkStock The bill, which is being pushed heavily by Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, would require clinics to have operating ratios of one nurse per patient, one personal-care technician per every three patients and one social worker for every 75 patients. Dialysis clinics not meeting these staffing levels would not be allowed to operate. Sean Wherley , SEIU-UHW spokesman, said his organization brought the idea for the bill to California state Sen. Ricardo Lara after hearing from workers at Southern California dialysis clinics — both DaVita centers and other companies’ operations — that staffing levels were being kept distressingly low. California adopted minimum staffing levels for nurses in 1999, and patients going in for kidney care should be able to avoid the kinds of situations that workers have reported to the union, such as having to choose between caring for one person whose blood pressure is dropping and another who is vomiting in reaction to their treatment, because they can’t call for back-up personnel, he said. “You’ve got these companies, DaVita and (primary competitor) Fresenius, that are making billions of dollars per year, and it’s time to put patients before profits,” Wherley said. Maughan said that DaVita doesn’t rely on a concrete staffing ratio at its clinics but adjusts those levels depending on the location and amount of patients the facilities are expecting. And patients in the 43 states currently without staffing guidelines are no less healthy than those in the seven states with them, he said. However, the California rule puts patients in jeopardy and risks increasing public health-care spending because DaVita could have to shut down clinics and redirect patients to hospitals if workers call in sick and the company can’t find replacements, Maughan said. Clinics already are heavily regulated as well, leading company officials to suspect ulterior motives for the bill. “I don’t think this is part of a grand plan,” he said. “I think this is a union attempting to figure out how they can curry favor and get more membership, frankly.” DaVita operates 370 clinics employing a cumulative total of 10,000 people in California. None of DaVita’s workforce is unionized. Wherley responded that the push for staffing is coming not from the union, but from existing workers who also are interested in unionizing. Some of the stretched-thin clinic staffers work three 12-hour shifts per week for DaVita, and then another three 12-hour shifts per week for Fresenius, he added.
