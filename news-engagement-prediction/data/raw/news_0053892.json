Quoting a story published on a website, Swaraj today tweeted, \"I have asked Indian High Commissioner in Pakistan to send me a report on this.\" The website said Singh has been languishing in Kot Lakhpat prison for the past 32 years. A leader of Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, Azizullah Khan, had asked Singh's family to send documents related to appeal for freeing him, it claimed. Singh is believed to have ventured into Pakistan while shepherding buffaloes in 1985 where he was arrested by Pakistan Rangers, it said.
