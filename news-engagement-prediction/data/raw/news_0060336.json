Footage of some of the criminal mastermind’s past work show masked gunmen stalking and shooting their victims in a mall, panicked crowds running for their lives, and parents trying to hide their children. In the episode, the agent says the attack was in Egypt where more than 200 people died, “including 18 Americans.” \nKenyan viewers knew better. Many caught onto the fact that the footage used to portray the fictional attack was taken from real life. It came from the 2013 attack on a shopping mall in Nairobi that killed at least 67 people, most of them Kenyan, in a crisis that forever changed the country’s security regime and exacerbated unease in the capital of East Africa’s largest economy. \nKenyan internet users promptly began tweeting at Fox and the show under the hashtags #SomeoneTellFox (a riff on an earlier internet campaign highlighting a gaff by CNN ) and #Westgate: #SomeoneTellFox that you were very insensitive to do this to those who still have nightmares and lost loved ones. pic.twitter.com/RvEJD2UxRP — Sam Gichuru (@SamGichuru) February 22, 2017 #SomeoneTellFox @FOXTV How can you make money on the graves of our brothers and sisters, the actual attack footage?
