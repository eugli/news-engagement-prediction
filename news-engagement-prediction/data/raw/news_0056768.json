What happens between India and China has both great global and regional significance. \n\n\"Our assessment coming in is that our bilateral relations have really acquired a very steady momentum over many years. Our leadership-level meetings have been taking place regularly and our economic engagement is growing. We are seeing cooperation on many international issues and our border areas have maintained peace and tranquility,\" he said. \n\n\"Overall the closer development partnership has been unfolding,\" he said. \n\nApparently referring to differences, Jaishankar said, \"there are natural issues which neighbours have\" and it is the responsibility of both the countries to address them. \n\nZhang said \"I expect that we discuss the full range of issues that are important to our countries\". \n\nSeveral top officials from both sides, including those in-charge of nuclear disarmament issues, were present at the talks indicating that both sides will be discussing India's entry into the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) besides other issues. \n\nThe talks were being held in the backdrop of vocal differences between the two countries on a host of issues including India's concern over the USD 46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Beijing's reluctance to back India's application to join the NSG and the UN ban on Azhar. \n\nThe strategic dialogue was upgraded during Chinese Foreign Minister Yi's visit to New Delhi last year. China has deputed Zhang, also the head of the influential Communist Party of China (CPC) committee of the Chinese Foreign Ministry to co-chair the talks. \n\nAhead of today's talks Jaishankar, who formerly worked as India's Ambassador to China, met China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi yesterday and held talks with him on the critical issues bedevilling the bilateral ties. \n\nDuring their talks, both Yang and Jaishankar expressed strong commitment to develop positive relations despite differences. \n\nYang, who is the State Councillor and Beijing's Special Representative for border talks between India and China, had said despite differences, relations between the two sides had a positive growth last year.
