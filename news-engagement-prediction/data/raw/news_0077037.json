Most Popular 73f2d35b-90d5-4a0a-a44f-39ec34ff95d9 27 February, 2017 In quite possibly one of the biggest mix-ups in award show history, presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway accidentally declared the wrong winner for Best Picture at the Oscars on Sunday night, naming La La Land instead of Moonlight . WATCH: 'La La Land' announced as #Oscars Best Picture winner, but only until a mistake is realized with 'Moonlight' being the real winner. pic.twitter.com/wYsUngcdwe \n— ABC News (@ABC) February 27, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below It was an unprecedented mistake that left everyone totally floored — and many are still trying to figure out what the hell happened. Based on the evidence available so far, it appears that Beatty and Dunaway were given the incorrect envelope before taking the stage, a story Beatty later confirmed while trying to explain the mix-up.

Can you hear a voice at the end of this clip say \"It says Emma Stone\"? pic.twitter.com/ayfJGqla6I \n— Dave Itzkoff (@ditzkoff) February 27, 2017 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below However, as Stone later stated backstage after the award show, she was in possession of the card which declared her the winner — because presenter Leonardo DiCaprio had given it to her.

I don't mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was, I had that card. So I'm not sure that happened.\" Photos of Stone and DiCaprio confirm her version of things, and show her holding the red envelope backstage. 73f2d35b-90d5-4a0a-a44f-39ec34ff95d9 73f2d35b-90d5-4a0a-a44f-39ec34ff95d9 So how is it possible that Beatty also had the envelope? As it turns out, there are two copies of winning envelopes created every year. Earlier this month, Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz — partners at the professional services firm PricewaterhouseCoopers — revealed in an interview that they're the two people who get to know the winners of the Oscars before anyone else. \n— Collider (@Collider) February 27, 2017 Most Popular \"The producers decide what the order of the awards will be,\" Cullinan told Medium . \"We each have a full set. I have all 24 envelopes in my briefcase; Martha has all 24 in hers. We stand on opposite sides of the stage, right off-screen, for the entire evening, and we each hand the respective envelope to the presenter. It doesn't sound very complicated, but you have to make sure you're giving the presenter the right envelope.\" Because DiCaprio presented the award for Best Actress alone, that means either Cullinan or Ruiz still had their copy of the envelope for that award — and somehow, it ended up in Beatty's hands when he was announcing Best Picture. It's not clear at this time who put it there, but at least it explains how such a monumental mistake could be possible. As People reports, the crew backstage seemed to further confirm the whole thing wasn't Beatty's fault, and that he was definitely in possession of the wrong envelope: \nAs the drama unfolded, Beatty walked off stage clutching the envelope. \"Warren Beatty won't give up the envelope! Security is coming,\" one person says. Someone asks Beatty if he's okay — he walks ahead and holds the envelope. Faye Dunaway appears totally upbeat and goes over what happened with a friend, and says something about seeing Emma Stone's name on the card. The mystery continues.
