Days before the end of his tenure in February last year, he was given another extension till March 1, 2017. \n\nMany senior bureaucrats, including some Secretary-level officers, were in contention for the top post of capital market regulator. \n\nTyagi for a short while was also on the board of Reserve Bank of India (RBI). \n\nThe process for selecting the next chief of the Sebi started in September 2015, pursuant to which several applications were received for the position. \n\n\"Keeping in view the role and importance of Sebi as a regulator, it is desirable that persons with high integrity, eminence and reputation preferably with more than 25 years of professional experience and in the age group of 50-60 years may apply,\" the Finance Ministry had said while inviting applications for the post. \n\nHowever, the government had in February last decided to give a one-year extension to Sinha to ensure stability due to volatile market conditions. \n\nSebi chairman receives consolidated pay package of Rs 4.5 lakh per month. \n\nBesides chairman and whole-time members, the Sebi board includes independent members and nominees of Finance Ministry, Corporate Affairs Ministry and the RBI.
