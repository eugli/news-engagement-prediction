Article continues below \nBut despite his stock still remaining high among Europe's elite, he could be about to make a strange decision to take his career elsewhere. \nAccording to a report on ESPN , the Mexican international is attempting to negotiate his way back to the other side of the Atlantic by signing for new MLS franchise LAFC. Article continues below The amount of times Leicester players attempted to get Claudio Ranieri fired \nHowever, rather than trying to snap him up now, the American club will attempt to bring him on board in the summer of 2018 when his contract with Leverkusen expires. \nBy that point, the player will be 30 and judging by his apparent openness to the move it would seem that he fancies a move closer to home. \nBut the move still may not be that simple as he still has plenty of interest in his signature across Europe with the likes of Chelsea being credited with an interest. \nLeverkusen will likely want to cash in on his services, too, if they are resigned to losing him and may look to sell him on this summer instead. \nHernandez had previously been a target for the likes of Chicago Fire and Orlando City back in 2015, but instead opted to remain in Europe to compete in the Champions League. \nFurthermore, his salary would run up $9 million, which would be one of the highest in the league and could remain a sticking point in negotiations. \nLAFC are set to start competing in 2018 and will rival cross-city rivals LA Galaxy and will be the second time the City has had two sides following the dissolution of Chivas USA in 2014. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
