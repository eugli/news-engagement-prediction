Raj Bhavan sources said the Governor sought the report on Sunday before leaving for Mumbai. \n\nIt was a busy day for Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao as he met with three groups of visitors at his official residence in Raj Bhavan on Sunday. He first met with a delegation led by chief minister Edappady K Palaniswami and later with DMK Rajya Sabha members representing the party's working president M K Stalin. A rival faction led by O Panneerselvam also called on the Governor. \n\nWhile Palaniswami termed his visit a courtesy call, the DMK delegation submitted a petition from Stalin appealing to the Governor to \"nullify\" the vote of confidence won by Palaniswami as it was adopted by \"contravening the rules of the state Assembly\". \n\nThe assembly witnessed disruptions and unruly scenes during the vote of confidence on Saturday. \n\nThe DMK and the OPS camp sought secret ballot for the trust vote and staged strong protest when the speaker did not agree to their request. \n\nThe vote was preceded by eviction of principal opposition DMK and walkout by its allies, which have 98 legislators in the 234-member House, in protest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T04:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T18:25:26.309+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
