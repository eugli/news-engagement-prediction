The judicial organs apply laws and adjudicate cases according to legal powers and procedures, and perform the functions of settling disputes, punishing the evil and praising the good, granting remedies, setting rules and other statutory functions, to ensure the effective application of laws and safeguard social fairness and justice. The improvement of the judicial management system and the standardization of the exercise of judicial powers will help the judicial system play a more effective role in administering the country and managing governmental affairs by operation of law, and promote the modernization of governance system and capability in our country. \nChina's courts have been attaching great importance to judicial reform. Since 2013, on the background of deepening reform in an all-round way, by taking the fundamental realities of our country into consideration and keeping pace with the times, and with the aim to make the public experience fairness and justice in each judicial case, China's courts have been advancing judicial reform in an active, steady and practical manner and scored great achievements. Through deepening judicial reform, China will continuously improve the public credibility of the judiciary, promote judicial impartiality, and build a fair, efficient and authoritative socialist judicial system.
