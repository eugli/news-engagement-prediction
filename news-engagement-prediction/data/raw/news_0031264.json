He said he was standing in line with his grandson for a treat at the canteen after a game when he heard \"loud noises\" around the corner.\n\"There was a big commotion over there and then some people ran by screaming, said 'Get out, there's guys with guns.' I just kept on staying — I thought they were just joking or something,\" he said.\n\"A few seconds later, about 20, 30 people come running around the corner and they said, 'Get out, run, run, there's guys with guns.'\"\nPolice ask for help with 2 unsolved homicides Sutherland said he and his grandson ran out of the building and into the parking lot, where he found his wife and the rest of his family.\n\"We split in the parking lot because there was people that I knew, their kids were missing and they were crying. So we tried to help them a bit and talked to them there,\" he said.\nNo gun on scene, police say A police spokesman couldn't confirm later Sunday how many people were taken into custody, but said there were multiple individuals involved. However, he said it appeared not all of them would be kept in custody.\nPolice said none of the individuals had firearms, and said to their knowledge, none had any other type of weapons, either. Police didn't know if anybody had been injured.\nNo charges recommended against officers in deadly Winnipeg police shooting \"At the end of the day, this is not a major incident,\" he said.\nIt's unclear whether charges will be laid.\n\nSocial media posts citing guns on scene After the incident, many took to social media believing there had been a gun on the premises.\n\n​\n\nIn the moment, Sutherland said the worst went through his mind, too.\n\"It's quite scary to be — you hear this on the news, you know, and you see these things happening in Quebec, there, you know, it's really scary,\" he said. \"When there's a whole bunch of people assembled some people, they think they can just come shooting innocent people. That's what came across my mind there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:16:26.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
