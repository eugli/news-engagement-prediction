We also have to take into consideration the operational needs to the health regions and the fact that we definitely need leadership in the regions, particularly in this time of change,” Smith said. \nREAD MORE: Sask. doctors say health region consolidation mammoth task, but could improve care \nThe NDP said they’ve been calling on the government for years to address the administration in the health region and the number of upper-level positions that have grown under the current government. \n“You look to RQHR, where they’ve seen in about a three-year period a 46 per cent growth in upper-level management in executives,” said health critic Danielle Chartier. \nThe ministry said the single health region will be implemented in the fall. © 2017 The Canadian Press ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T09:06:49.876+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
