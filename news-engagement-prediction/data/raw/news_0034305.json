The Israeli leader and President Donald Trump could both use a boost when they meet Wednesday, particularly before strains develop. Though both men have declared their mutual support and outlined similar views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the realities of the region and entrenched positions on all sides are likely to intrude on the relationship at some point. For now, though, they're still in the honeymoon phase. \"It's going to be an absolute love fest,\" said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute, speaking of the meeting. \"They both know the likelihood is that in the long run there will be tensions and an argument,\" he said, given that Trump has indicated he wants to tackle a Middle East peace agreement and has sent conflicting signals on Israel. \"But for now, there are no major issues between them.

Being one of the first foreign leaders to visit the new US president gives Israel and its leader status. More crucially, it gives him a chance to shape the new US administration's nascent Middle East policy and gain some clarity on mixed and potentially worrying signals for Israel. As Netanyahu arrives at the White House on Wednesday, he'll be meeting with a US president who hasn't quite decided on key points. A source with knowledge of the policy deliberations said the White House is still figuring out what its policy toward the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be. \"I think they don't know yet,\" the source said. When it comes to the concept of the two-state solution to the conflict, a bedrock of current US policy, a senior US official said, \"Maybe, maybe not. It's something the two sides have to agree to. It's not for us to impose that vision.\" JUST WATCHED ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T11:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T07:08:27.812+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
