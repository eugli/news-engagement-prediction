Those of us who believe in a better world must be the first to do what we believe is right or needs to be done to achieve such a world‚” she said. \nIn an interview with the Citizen last week‚ after Mkhwebane addressed journalists on her first 100 days in office‚ Madonsela accused the new public protector of spreading fake news about her. \nMadonsela denied that she owed almost R500 000 for repairs to the damaged state-provided BMW and that she had used it for longer than allowed. \n“I’ve maintained silence because I believe that’s a proper thing to do but it’s not true that I still have to pay the money for the car or that I abused any car‚” she told the newspaper. \nThe foundation said Madonsela hoped to put the ordeal behind her and focus on her new projects. She is working on an autobiography. \n- TMG Digital Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
