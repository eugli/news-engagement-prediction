The rumoured couple may be tight-lipped when it comes to confirming their relationship, but they do not fall short of words when it comes to commenting on the other’s post. If not engaging in a quote war, the two are often seen engaging in friendly banter. This time around, the topic of discussion happed to be flowers. While Sonam was gushing over orchids, Anand took the opportunity to playfully pass a snide remark aimed at her. Anand posted a picture of white Orchids, to which Sonam commented saying, “Orchids represent love perfection thoughtfulness and beauty as they are perfectly formed. White Orchids represent reverence, humility, innocence and purity and elegance and beauty.” Anand was quick to counter her description by saying, “They’re also just pretty!” He even went on to correct her grammar and tease her saying, “Also what is ‘love perfection thoughtfulness’? Do you mean ‘love, perfection, thoughtfulness’? Or are you thinking of book titles like Eat Pray Love?” All Comments ()", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T13:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T16:13:33.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
