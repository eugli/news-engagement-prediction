He’s kind and caring — nothing like the man who would do this. \n\"I know he had become more extremist over the years but I spoke to him a few months back and he seemed just like the brother I knew. I’m devastated.” Who was Jamal al-Harith? MUSLIM convert Jamal al-Harith was freed from the infamous US detention centre in 2004 after then-Home Secretary David Blunkett campaigned for his release. \nAt the time of al-Harith’s release from Guantanamo Bay, Mr Blunkett, said: “No one who is returned…will actually be a threat to the security of the British people.” \nThe ex-Labour cabinet member initially opposed the return of British Guantanamo Bay detainees. \nHe wanted the captives tried in American civil courts because he feared trials in the UK could collapse because of the conditions they were held in, in the United States. \nWhen al-Harith was released in 2004, he was repatriated to England and released without charge. \nChilling footage of his attack shows a pack of suicide cars stuffed with bombs and encased in armour travelling near Mosul. \nIt later shows another fighter cheering before he shuts the driver-side door and pulls off. \nMoments later giant clouds of smoke can be seen in the distance. \nAt least two of the jihadis managed to reach a base west of the city where they detonated their explosives — killing and injuring a number of troops, the Iraqi soldiers said. \nThe extremists later released a statement saying: \"The martyrdom-seeking brother Abu Zakariya al-Britani — may Allah accept him — detonated his explosives-laden vehicle on a headquarters of the Rafidhi army and its militias in Tal Kisum village, southwest of Mosul.\" Andy Hall/The Guardian Al-Harith, third from right, was pictured in a photoshoot for The Guardian of ex-Guantanamo Bay detainees Andy Hall/The Guardian 14 Jamal Al-Harith, born Ronald Fiddler, was killed attacking Iraqi troops in a suicide bombing \nFiddler's wife, Shukee Begum, reportedly took her five children to Syria to try and \"speak some sense\" into her husband in August 2014. \nThe then 33-year-old from Manchester told Channel 4 News a year later that she had wanted her husband to be with their children, including a four-week-old baby who he had not seen before. \nDespite Fiddler's decision to join IS, Ms Begum insisted that her husband of 11 years was a \"family man\", adding: \"I've always known him to be a good man with good characteristics. \n\"For me to take the children to see him and then come away from there that would have been more powerful than anything else I could have said at the time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T11:50:19.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
