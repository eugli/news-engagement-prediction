When we bat together we have a good understanding, and it will be exactly the same in these new roles.\" \n\nRoot has had a close-up view of Stokes's skill on the Test stage, be it his blistering double century against South Africa in Cape Town last year or his five-wicket haul in England's 2015 Ashes-clinching victory at Trent Bridge , a match destined to be remembered for Stuart Broad 's remarkable eight for 15 on the first day. \n\n\"He's very 'in your face', and sometimes you need that up-front brashness,\" said Root of Stokes. \n\n\"That second-innings display from Ben -- the 'five-for', the skill he showed -- I am sure in any other Test match he would have got man-of-the-match,\" added Root, modestly omitting his century in the same match. \n\n\"Then, the way he played in South Africa was just incredible -- and he is that sort of player that with the odd moment in the field can really change a game, turn it on its head.\" \n\nCook said one reason why he was able to lead England in a record 59 Tests was to avoid social media, thereby remaining ignorant of the more extreme criticism that came his way. \n\nRoot, however, has no intention of closing his Twitter account any time soon. \n\n\"It's something I've grown up with in international sport, so I'm used to it,\" Root explained. \"With Cooky, it came along half way through his career. \n\n\"With the new age we're in now, where social media is a big part of communicating and getting things out there, it's something you've just got to adapt to and accept ... it's always going to be there. \n\n\"It's a great opportunity to get your messages across as well.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T17:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T07:45:15.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
