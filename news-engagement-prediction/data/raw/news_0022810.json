The couple are tenants of an apartment on the top floor of the building.\n\nThe woman dangling from ther edge of the building.

If we were late by a few seconds or her husband couldn’t hold on to her hair for a few more seconds, it might have been impossible to save her.”\nA video circulated on the internet shows a police officer climbing over a barrier to reach the woman, with colleagues holding on to his clothes to stop him falling.\nThe husband was also outside the barrier holding on to his wife’s hair, with officers keeping him safe by pulling the hood of his jacket.\nPolice added that part of the woman’s body was resting on a 30cm-wide pipe, which took part of her body weight. Police said that without the support given by the pipe, the woman would have fallen despite her husband’s efforts.\n\nPolice officers pull the woman to safety. Photo: Sohu.com.   The woman, who was then highly emotional, was constantly screaming “let go” to her husband during the incident, even after the police managed to seize one of her arms, the article said.\nThe newspaper cited studies saying about 2,000 hairs can in theory hold up to 30kg in weight, but the scalp’s ability to carry weight is limited. – South China Morning Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T05:22:57.547+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
