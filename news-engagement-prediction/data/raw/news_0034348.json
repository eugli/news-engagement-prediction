Past negotiations have operated on the assumption that such an outcome would roughly fall along the lines that resulted from the Six Day War in 1967, with mutually agreed land swaps reflecting a change in demographics.But Trump administration officials suggested that peace between the parties might be possible in another framework.\"If I ask five people what a two-state solution is, I get eight different answers,\" one said.The administration seeks a seamless public viewing tomorrow that suggests \"no daylight\" between the two governments, after eight years of tension between Netanyahu and former US President Barack Obama.Trump officials expect settlements will be a topic of conversation during the meeting. Iran's regional activities and its nuclear program will also top the agenda.
