Commissioner Price, who just won re-election in November, denies it all. \nFormer U.S. Attorney Paul Coggins said, “We’re talking about a money trail. The government says it stretches over a decade [with] multiple sources, multiple companies, multiple transactions.” \nSome legal experts say the case against Price is strong. “The odds are stacked in favor of the government, because they don’t indict a case that they can’t prove,” said Dallas attorney Victor Vital. \nOther local lawyers don’t believe the case is a lock, especially since none of the contractors who supposedly benefited from Price’s pay-to-play conspiracy are charged in the case. \nDallas attorney Paul Stafford said, “A case could certainly be made that the allegations made against John Wiley Price may not be unique to John Wiley Price in the history of Dallas County.” \nPrice is indicted on 11 counts of conspiracy, bribery and mail fraud. \nThe scope of the case is huge. The indictment alone reads over 100 pages and more than 170 witnesses are named. \nFain will be tried alongside Price. Co-defendant Nealy will likely face her own trial. Charges against her were separated from the others after a court ruling. She has previously cooperated with federal prosecutors. \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
