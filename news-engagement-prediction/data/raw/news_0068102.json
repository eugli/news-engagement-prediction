FUJITV/via Reuters TV. A \nKUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia said on Saturday (Feb 25) it would issue an arrest warrant for a North Korean diplomat wanted for questioning over the murder of Kim Jong Nam if he doesn't voluntarily cooperate with the police. \n\"Reasonable\" time will be given for the diplomat to come forward before police take further action, said Abdul Samah Mat, the police chief for Selangor state. \nOn Wednesday, Malaysia said 44-year-old Hyon Kwang Song, a second secretary at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur, was wanted for questioning over the death of the estranged half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \nSamah said if the person concerned did not cooperate the police would issue a notice under Malaysian law, \"compelling\" them to appear before the investigation team. \n\"And if he failed to turn up upon given this notice, then we will go to the next step by getting a warrant of arrest from the court,\" he told reporters. \nMalaysia's Inspector General of Police said earlier that the police could not issue a warrant for Hyon as he was protected by diplomatic immunity. Any request had to be made via Malaysia’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, he said. \nWhen asked on Saturday about the diplomatic immunity, the Selangor police chief said: “This is an investigation into a crime, so we have all the powers to call anybody to assist in our investigations.\" \nEight North Koreans are wanted in connection with the case, including the diplomat. One has been detained by the Malaysian police, four are believed to have fled to North Korea, while two others are still in Malaysia. \nKim Jong Nam was murdered on Feb 13 at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport by VX nerve agent, classified by the United Nations as a weapon of mass destruction, Malaysian police said on Friday. \nTwo women - one Indonesian and one Vietnamese - have also been detained. Police said on Friday that one of them suffered from the effects of VX and had been vomiting. \nSamah also confirmed that authorities raided an apartment in an upscale Kuala Lumpur suburb on Wednesday in connection with the killing. \nInvestigators were still looking for any traces of chemicals in the apartment, he added. \nHe also said the police are working closely with the chemistry and forensics departments, as well as Malaysia's Atomic Energy Licensing Board, to ensure there were no “elements” that could jeopardise public health. \n\"There's been worries about this from certain quarters of people, so we are looking into it whether there's any effect on the health of people,\" he said, stressing this was just a precaution. \n\"We will announce once is action taken ... we can't say anything yet.\" - Reuters/CNA/cy ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T13:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T08:54:41.021+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
