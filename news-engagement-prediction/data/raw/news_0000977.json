The Budget could have mitigated the concerns in the tech sector,\" Kharge told ET. \n\nKarnataka is home to a third of India's software exports, and more than 90% of income comes from the US market. \n\n\"There has been a slowdown in technology enabled services. With restrictions on H1B visas expected, we are seeing a short-term impact in the tech sector. We expected the FM to engage with the technology sector much more, and boost confidence in the sector by incentivising them. But that has not happened,\" the IT Minister said. \n\nThe government, Kharge said, could have done more to help startups though he has increased the window of tax holiday from three years to five years. The government could have further reduced tax slabs and encouraged entrepreneurs. \n\nThe Budget provides no clarity on how the government plans to get investments for programmes such as Make in India and Digital India , he said \"This government is high on rhetoric and low on deliverables,\" he added. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T22:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:09:31.054+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
