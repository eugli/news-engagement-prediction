The minor's mother was dating Sandusky at the time and had been for six years. Sandusky lived with the woman and her children for five of those years.\nVictim No. 1's father contacted police on Nov. 21, 2016, and said Sandusky sent texts requesting the material on March 1 and 2 of that year. The father then provided proof of those messages to police, per the complaint. In one message, Sandusky allegedly said it wasn't weird to receive the material because he is \"studying medicine.\"\nSandusky is then accused of demanding the victim erase all the incriminating texts and that nothing be mentioned to anyone. Sandusky requested a meeting to talk things over, but the victim responded \"we don't need to talk and we aren't going to\" before adding these were the actions of a \"rapist.\"\nSandusky also is accused of engaging in sexual intercourse with a minor under the age of 16, referred to as victim No. 2 in the complaint. That alleged offense took place in 2013, when Sandusky was 37.\nAccording to NBC News, Sandusky has been suspended from his job at Rockview State Correctional facility.\nNBC News: Jeffrey Sandusky has been suspended from his job at Rockview State Correctional facility pending the outcome of his case.\nâ€” Tom Winter (@Tom_Winter) February 13, 2017 READ THE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT", "external_links": ["http://usat.ly/2kDYF16", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/2kDzLyp&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/uxstatic/azcentral/uscp-web-static-2277.0/images/sprites/icon_close.png", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/197b646b6e91271e718bb3a4b25cc68fb49c1611/c=0-0-1500-2000&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2017/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636225964629185204-AP-SANDUSKY-SON-ABUSE-88761820.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/1062/29906170001_5322021520001_5322018602001-th.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/517d7130ba7e9b0d604d1137c4e40737577f6fb9/r=308x400/local/-/media/2017/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636225964629185204-AP-SANDUSKY-SON-ABUSE-88761820.JPG", "https://twitter.com/Tom_Winter/status/831225304639275010", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d44bf9ac740cfa2e4c015e985cf20e4ec8d6fdc9/r=540/http/videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/1062/29906170001_5322021519001_5322018602001-vs.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/201702/1062/29906170001_5322026141001_5322018602001.mp4", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/1062/29906170001_5322021519001_5322018602001-vs.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/1062/29906170001_5322021519001_5322018602001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636225964629185204-AP-SANDUSKY-SON-ABUSE-88761820.JPG", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201702/1062/29906170001_5322021520001_5322018602001-th.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/2kDzLyp&text=Jerry%20Sandusky%27s%20son%20arrested%2C%20charged%20with%20child%20sexual%20abuse&via=azcentral", "https://drive.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http%3A//www.gannett-cdn.com/usatoday/editorial/sports/ncaaf/jeffrey-sandusky-complaint.pdf&embedded=true", "http://www.usatoday.com/videos/sports/ncaaf/2017/02/13/jerry-sandusky"], "published": "2017-02-14T09:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T05:03:30.716+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
