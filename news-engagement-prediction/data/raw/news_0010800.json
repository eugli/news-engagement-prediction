Prasad said that the commandos had come early from J&K as they had to reach Bihar on February 7. He, however, agreed that \"they cannot be termed as deserters even though they should have informed the seniors\". \n\nThe force downplayed the incident saying, \"These personnel were returning to their unit after completion of their 6 months training at Recruitment Training Centre, Srinagar and had their return reservations from Jammu to Gaya on 5 February, 2017 in Shealdah Express. Due to inclement weather and road blockade these personnel were sent to Jammu on 1 Feb, 2017 and decided to board an early train on 2 nd February. Since they were early as per their scheduled programme, they decided on their own to avail Saturday and Sunday to visit their home without prior permission from competent authority. These personnel have committed a misconduct for which they will be dealt departmentally.\" \n\nSenior officials of the Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) and CRPF said the jawans were scheduled to report at the headquarters of the 205th CoBRA unit in Gaya in Bihar for their onward deployment for conducting special anti-Naxalite operations in Bihar. They were trained in a batch of 600 commandoes in J&K. Others were to follow them later. \n\n\"A full Inquiry has been ordered by the force headquarters in Delhi. The trainers and the havildar who was accompanying these commandos have got in touch with some of those who vanished from the train without informing seniors. Some have promised to report by tomorrow,\" senior officials said. \n\nIt is to be ascertained as to how all of the men decided to make the slip en masse, sources said, adding the jawans were \"not armed\". \n\nOfficials added that maximum of the commandos who undertook this 'mass bunk' hail from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. \n\nThe CoBRA was raised in 2009 by the central government under CRPF to act as a special guerrilla combat wing for tackling violence perpetrated by naxalites as well as insurgents in the northeast with the aid of specific intelligence inputs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T04:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:21:31.494+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
