John Schindler is a former National Security Agency analyst and current columnist for the New York Observer . On Sunday, he went viral with a column, \" The Spy Revolt Against Trump Begins ,\" which included a bombshell accusation that intelligence agencies were withholding information from the Trump administration over fears that the Kremlin had ears in every room in the White House. \nSchindler wrote: In light of this, and out of worries about the White House‚Äôs ability to keep secrets, some of our spy agencies have begun withholding intelligence from the Oval Office ... A senior National Security Agency official explained that NSA was systematically holding back some of the ‚Äúgood stuff‚Äù from the White House, in an unprecedented move ... In the last three weeks, however, NSA has ceased doing this, fearing Trump and his staff cannot keep their best SIGINT secrets. \nThis morning, President Trump unleashed on Twitter about possible leaks coming from the intelligence community, most likely in regards to a New York Times report last night detailing his campaign's contact with Russia . The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by \"intelligence\" like candy. Very un-American! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?).Just like Russia ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017 According to Schindler, lobbing that accusation at the intelligence community left them livid. \nSchindler went on a tweetstorm, which included some inflammatory accusations and juicy tidbits from people allegedly on the inside. He claims, without any facts or sources, that Trump colluded with the Kremlin and that a high-level source in the intelligence community told him \"Trump will die in jail.\" Keep going, Don, keep going....I told you how going to war with the spooks would work out. https://t.co/JjdSszFbFP ‚Äî John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 BLUF: When the full extent of Trump's collusion with the Kremlin comes out -- incl using RIS to spy on Americans -- people will go to prison ‚Äî John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 BLUF stands for \"Bottom Line Up Front.\" US intelligence is not the problem here.The President's collusion with Russian intelligence is.Many details, but the essence is simple. ‚Äî John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 Now we go nuclear. IC war going to new levels. Just got an EM fm senior IC friend, it began: \"He will die in jail.\" https://t.co/e6FxCclVqT ‚Äî John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 Putin never viewed Trump as anything more than a useful lunatic. Moscow wants political chaos in America -- and oh boy are they getting it. ‚Äî John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 Surprisingly, some US spies consider POTUS colluding with RIS + Kremlin, incl election theft, to be kinda treason-y https://t.co/fyY7SS0rPv ‚Äî John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 At this point I'm relieved to have a place abroad to go in case America goes totally paws-up. Never thought we'd be here, but we are, folks. ‚Äî John Schindler (@20committee) February 15, 2017 \nSchindler's inflammatory tweets have drawn considerable attention, especially from far-right outlets and pro-Trump Twitter users, eager to dismiss his commentary as fake news or un-American.
