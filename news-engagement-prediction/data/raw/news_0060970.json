(Penguin Random House) Joseph Hernandez on “The Barefoot Contessa” preparing one of her fabulous feasts. My memory is as hazy-gauzy as the show’s well-lit production values; she was making some sort of beef stew, with a whole bottle of “dry red wine. So delicious.” Those words, one of her many signature catch phrases, are indelibly etched in my mind. “So delicious.” I wanted what she was selling.\nI somehow convinced my mother to let me cook Ina’s recipe. At our next grocery store trip, I convinced her to buy a bottle of nondescript “dry cooking wine” — literally, that’s what it said on the bottle — and upon returning home, I rushed to make the dish. \nIt was not, truth be told, “so delicious,” but that’s not Ina’s fault; I was 13, what’d I know about buying wine? \nI botched that recipe but I didn’t glorify Garten any less. If anything, she inspired me to reach out and cook more. In her kitchen, nothing is off limits, and food, ultimately, is about the shared experience around the table. The stew I made for my family may not have been good, but I still made it for my family — and that’s the point. \nSo it goes in Garten’s newest book, “Cooking for Jeffrey.” A love letter to her nearly 50 years with her smiling husband, Jeffrey Garten, her 10th tome is one of her most personal to date. Filled with stories from all parts of her life — with Jeffrey or with her other friends — every recipe is a trip down memory lane, a fond remembrance of an occasion or what inspired the dish. \nAhead of the cookbook author-turned-cooking icon’s visit to Chicagoland for her book tour, I chatted with Garten about her recipe development process, her grace under pressure, and why she set out to write this book. ( Ina Garten will appear at Rosemont Theater, 5400 N. River Road, Rosemont, on March 9 at 7:30 p.m. Buy tickets here. ) \nQ: You’re the only person I can point to that “cooks with love,” and it doesn’t feel like a cliche — is that what drives you? \nA: It’s the only reason I cook, otherwise I’d just open a can of soup. When I started thinking about the book, I realized cooking for Jeffrey is what made my career, how much he appreciates it — that’s why I cook. Cooking can be hard work, but if you do it out of love, it’s not perfunctory. \nQ: You cook for seemingly everyone — how do you feel when someone else is in the kitchen? \nA: I’m delighted whenever someone cooks for me! They could honestly just do take-out, and I wouldn’t care. I don’t have to come up with a menu or clean up, and it’s just fun. I have a friend, a serious restaurateur, who just orders all his favorite mail-order items and puts them out for a party. I just love that. \nQ: Has there ever been a time you’ve hosted and you were frazzled? \nA: People think I’m the most relaxed hostess in the world, but if Jeffrey tries to talk to me 15 minutes before a dinner, I yell “don’t talk to me!” My rule is never let them see you sweat. A few years ago, some dessert I made was a disaster, but 20 minutes before people showed up, I threw together berries, creme fraiche, honey and vanilla. My guests didn’t know I had a disaster, the recipe actually ended up in a book! If your boeuf bourgignon doesn’t turn out the way you wanted, don’t say anything. People are more important than the dinner — just have a good time and forget that something disappointed you. \nQ: You’ve cooked for Jeffrey for so long, is there a dish or food that gives you a powerful Proustian moment? \nI talk about it in the book, but when we were young and recently married, we traveled to France on a budget. We bought camping gear to avoid paying for a hotel, and we planned to cook in our tent. We stopped in Paris and there were so many wonderful ingredients — nothing was too complicated. It taught me that simple food could be extraordinary when using amazing ingredients. Classic, simple dishes still transport me to that trip, like roast chicken. The owner of a camp site we stayed at, a French woman, invited us to join in on a meal of roast chicken and I just thought, “this is so amazing, I need to know how to make this.” \nQ: Any other tips for hosting? \nA: I suggest setting up a drink table, instead of making everyone cocktails. You’re already cooking — let people figure it out. I’ll come up with a cocktail and put out all the ingredients, but let people help each other make their drinks. It becomes a social activity. I also never plate anything. I put out everything buffet style in the kitchen, and I almost never serve in the dining room. That way, I don’t have to leave the party to get up and get the next course prepared. My magic number of guests is six — everybody gets involved in the party. \nQ: How do you go about developing your recipes? You are famous for “simple elegance,” and when people watch you on TV, everything just seems so effortless. \nA: I always ask “is it too complicated for people?” I want to know that if you spend time to follow my recipes — from shopping to cooking to the meal — that if you dedicated that time in the kitchen, it turned out just right. I always have an idea of what I want to do, so I’m always testing for the perfect flavor and texture. Some times we’ll try a recipe four times, or 20 times. I watch my assistant follow my directions. For instance, “dice the carrot.” How big is the dice? Once, I wrote “stick the clove into the onion,” and she asked me “how do I stick cloves of garlic into an onion?” I meant dried cloves, but testing helped me realize that there are people who will not know what I meant unless I’m clear. On my website, I have an “Ask Ina” section — people end up asking me questions about cooking I’ve never thought of. I really learn a lot from those questions, and I always incorporate little notes on the sides of my recipes, so I can talk through steps with the reader. \njbhernandez@chicagotribune.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:28:32.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
