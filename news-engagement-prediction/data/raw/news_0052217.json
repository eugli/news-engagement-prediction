Katie Cannon Glance at the menu of any restaurant and you should be able to tell how serious they are about waffles. If there's an iron in the house there's a waffle on the menu, and that turns out to be the case for over 80 restaurants in the metro area. But with so many places in the Twin Cities serving waffles how do you begin to make a short list? Done well, a waffle provides the perfect canvas for almost any combination of ingredients. These are waffles worth going out of your way for. Waffles that can't walk into a room without being noticed. Honorable mentions go to the waffles at: The Fremont, Al’s Breakfast, Saguaro, Bulldog Northeast, French Meadow MPLS & Bluestem Bar, Barbette, Lake & Irving, Eggy’s, and The Longfellow Grill.
