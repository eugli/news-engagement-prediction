Photo: Facebook \nDerbas pleaded guilty in August last year to 11 counts, relating to seven men, of dishonestly obtaining money by deception . \nShe befriended each of her victims through mobile phone-based dating services, Lavalife, Clique and Meeting Point, tricking them into thinking they were in some form of relationship before she asked to borrow money from them. \nAfter sharing a coffee and dinner, Derbas stole more than $1.7 million from one man. \nShe told the man, 69, she needed the money to pay her mortgage and later claimed she could not repay it because her son had died of swine flu. \n\"Seeing my mum last night and feeling her cold body did something to me that I couldn't shake. Baby please don't leave me,\" she messaged another of her victims. \n\"No matter what you think, I do love you. For some beautiful reason I look forward to spending every day for the rest of me life with you … I just wish mum had met you,\" she wrote to another. \nAs well as concocting intricate back stories, Derbas would call the men from different phones assuming different identities to justify why her alias could not repay the money to them. \nPolice found 15 mobile phones during a search of her home, and exchanges with 20 men other than those connected to the charges for which she was sentenced. \nFor some of the men, her rort started when she asked them to deposit money into her bank account so she could book an expensive hotel for them in the city. \nOne victim, who transferred Derbas a total of $93,523, ended up questioning her legitimacy after she told him that her mother had died and she needed money for funeral costs. \nWhen he told her that he was going to police, Derbas responded by saying, \"How is borrowing money a fraud?\" \nThe man later said to her: \"I really hope u don't have kids that might have to pay a huge price when u get caught.\" \nThe court has heard that Derbas has now sold all her assets - including her house in south-western Sydney and three cars - in a bid to pay the money back. Reparation of $745,000 has so far been made. \nShe told a psychiatrist that her fraudulent behaviour started as a result of a drug debt and cocaine habit which caused her to spend $10,000 to $12,000 a week. \nBut Judge Conlon said her rort continued out of greed and, to use Derbas' own words, \"became her new business\". \nDerbas was sentenced to a maximum of 3½ years' jail. \nShe will be eligible for parole in August 2018.
