Â— Feb 16, 2017, 6:42 PM ET 0 Shares Star Chloe Elmer, Pool/Reuters Bill Cosby re-enters Montgomery County Courthouse after a break during the second day of his pre-trial hearing in his sexual assault case in Norristown, Pennsylvania, Dec. 14, 2016. 0 Shares Email A federal judge in Massachusetts has dismissed a defamation lawsuit against comedian Bill Cosby , although he still faces criminal charges in Pennsylvania . Judge Mark Mastroianni ruled Thursday that Katherine McKee didn't adequately show Cosby defamed her when his representatives called a 2014 New York Daily News story on her rape allegations defamatory and demanded a retraction. The former actress alleged the 79-year-old Cosby raped her in a Detroit hotel in 1974. McKee was among dozens of women to come forward with allegations recently and among at least eight suing for defamation in Massachusetts, where Cosby owns a home. Cosby's lawyers called Thursday's decision the \"correct outcome.\" McKee's attorneys didn't immediately comment. In Pennsylvania, \"The Cosby Show\" star has pleaded not guilty to sexually assaulting a former employee at Temple University. 0 Shares", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T03:32:32.434+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
