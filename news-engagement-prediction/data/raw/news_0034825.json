Rand Paul (R-KY) said he didn’t see reason for Republicans to conduct any investigations into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn’s resignation, feeling the whole situation has already been appropriately managed. \n“I think that might be excessive,” Paul told host Brian Kilmeade . “It looks like the President has handled the situation, and unless there’s some kind of other evidence of malfeasance, this sounds like something that was internal White House politics and it looks like the President’s handled it.” \nPaul also noted that it was senseless for Republicans to be investigating other Republicans as it would take time away from working on their policy proposals. \n“I just don’t think it’s useful to be doing investigation after investigation, particularly of your own party,” the Kentucky lawmaker stated. “We’ll never even get started with doing the things we need to do, like repealing Obamacare, if we’re spending our whole time having Republicans investigate Republicans. I think it makes no sense.” \nPaul appears to be taking the same position as key House Republicans when it comes to whether investigations into Flynn and his communications with Russia are necessary. Earlier today, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said he wouldn’t probe President Donald Trump on the resignation but may look into the leaks. Meanwhile, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz said the situation is “taking care of itself.” \nListen to the radio clip above, via CNN’s KFILE. \n[image via screengrab]", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:56:51.845+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
