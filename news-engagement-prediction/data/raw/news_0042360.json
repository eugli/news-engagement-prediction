Set in the Makers House, where Anna Calvi performed live and artwork by Henry Moore dotted the runway, the Burberry show was a true spectacle—and yet Bailey ensured that his artful clothing was the real star. Here, we recap the fashion highs of the show. Check Vogue Runway later today for Chioma Nnadi’s full review of Burberry’s Spring 2017 women’s and men’s collection.

In classic ivory, the sweaters called to mind classic Irish fisherman knits, but with a modern, arty twist.

During Bailey’s 16 years at the house, he’s redone the brand’s staple in shining satins, ruched bubble shapes, and transparent rubber. This season’s iterations were more understated, arriving in beige and sky blue with oversize collars and long, draped sleeves. Photo: Yannis Vlamos / Indigital.tv The Arty Prints Henry Moore’s art was more than just a set piece at the Burberry show. Shirts and sweatshirts featured hand-drawn cartoons of screaming faces and reclining humans that echoed the sanguine shapes of Moore’s work but with a brighter palette.

Today, the fabric was made into wide-leg jeans for women and a workwear-like jacket and pants ensemble for men with engineer striping.
