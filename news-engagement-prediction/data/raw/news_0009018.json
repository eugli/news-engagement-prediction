The Girl on the Train Paula Hawkins Diary of a Wimpy Kid Jeff Kinney Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul Jeff Kinney Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever Jeff Kinney Truth or Die James Patterson \nThere were just two female authors with books in the top 10 - the other being the late Harper Lee with Go Set A Watchman, her long-awaited follow-up to To Kill A Mockingbird. \nHawkins said: \"As a voracious reader possessed of a fevered imagination, my childhood visits to the library were a thrill. \n\"I credit those weekly trips with making me the reader - and the writer - I became, so I could not be more delighted to discover that The Girl on the Train was the most borrowed book from UK libraries last year.\" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Paula Hawkins earned $10m in the year from June 2015, Forbes Magazine said \nHawkins grew up in Zimbabwe before moving to the UK, becoming a financial journalist for The Times and writing chick lit under the pseudonym Amy Silver. \nThe Girl on the Train is the first novel under her real name and was inspired by gazing into other peoples' houses and gardens during her daily commute, and wondering what secrets they held. \nEmily Blunt starred in the film version and has earned a Bafta nomination for best actress - but overall, the film has been less of a runaway success than the book. Hawkins' follow-up, Into the Water, is due out in May. \nAlthough Hawkins had the number one book in libraries, she does not appear among the top 10 most borrowed authors. \nUS crime writer James Patterson was number one on that list for the 10th year in a row, followed by children's favourites Julia Donaldson, Daisy Meadows, Roderick Hunt and Francesca Simon.
