It also prevents the entry of all refugees to the U.S. for 120 days and bars Syrian refugees indefinitely.\nMicrosoft issued an initial statement on Sunday, calling the executive order \"misguided and a fundamental step backwards,\" but Nadella further commented on the travel ban in a Q&A with employees. Nadella said the executive order goes against many of the \"enduring\" principles and values Microsoft follows , as well as his own personal story of someone who immigrated to the U.S.\n\"I am the product of the fundamental greatness of the United States,\" said the CEO, born in Hyderabad, India. \"It is the enlightened immigration policy of this country that even made it possible for me to come here in the first place and gave me all this opportunity.\"\nThe Redmond, Wash., company has pledged to work with Washington state's attorney general, Bob Ferguson, as he files a lawsuit against Trump over the immigration order. Seattle-based e-commerce giant Amazon ( AMZN ) also is working with Ferguson. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos late Monday spoke out against the order, saying it's \"one we do not support.\"\nNadella noted Microsoft will be working directly with affected employees and their families by providing legal assistance, as well as advocating on their behalf with the Trump administration and with Congress.\nNadella isn't the only Silicon Valley executive who underscored their personal relationship when denouncing the travel ban. Alphabet ( GOOGL ) President Sergey Brin pointed to his experience as a refugee from the Soviet Union when addressing a crowd of at least 100 Google employees who staged a walkout on Monday. About 2,000 Google employees in offices worldwide held rallies, with the event outside Google's San Francisco office attended by Brin and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who was born and raised in India.\n\"So many people were obviously outraged by this order, as am I myself, being an immigrant and a refugee,\" Brin said.\nBrin, also a Google co-founder, joined a protest against the order at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday.\nMany of Silicon Valley's leading tech executives voiced opposition to the order throughout the weekend and on Monday, including those at Facebook ( FB ) , Apple ( AAPL ) , Netflix ( NFLX ) , Tesla Motors ( TSLA ) and Twitter ( TWTR ) .\nGoogle, Netflix and Airbnb were among several technology companies that planned to meet on Tuesday to discuss filing an amicus curiae brief in support of a lawsuit challenging Trump's executive order on immigration, according to Reuters. An amicus brief is filed by parties that aren't litigants in the case but want to bring additional information or arguments to a judge's attention.\nOther companies invited to the meeting include Salesforce.com ( CRM ) , Adobe Systems ( ADBE ) , Reddit , Dropbox and Pinterest , among others, Reuters reported.\nAlphabet, Facebook, Apple and Adobe are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.
