With santan sawit or palm milk, you can have a healthier alternative to the conventional coconut milk ( santan ) and these local favourites can taste just as good.\n“It’s cholesterol-free, low-fat, rich with vitamins A and E and about 50% cheaper than traditional santan ,” said Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Datuk Seri Mah Siew Keong.\n“It is easy on the wallet, too, as a kilo of palm milk costs between RM7 and RM7.50 while its alternative costs about RM12,” he added.\n“It has a long shelf life, can be kept up to one month in room temperature if the package is opened and up to five months in the fridge.\n“It also requires only half the usage compared to coconut milk,” said Mah, who is passionate about extolling the benefits of palm milk, a product of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), an agency under his ministry.\nDeveloped by MPOB in 2008 and commercialised by Premium Food Corporation Sdn Bhd (PFC) since 2010 under the brand Khalis Santan Sawit, the product has yet to gain traction among local consumers. The palm milk technology has been patented in Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines.\nThe minister was speaking to reporters before the exchange of technology transfer agreement between MPOB and PFC for a new palm milk formula here yesterday.\nMah said there was still scepticism over palm milk among home users even though many local food operators had switched to it.\nIts plant in Seri Kembangan produces about 60 to 80 tonnes of palm milk worth about RM360,000 a month.\nMah said that while palm milk consumption made up only 1% of the overall local market, there was ample potential for the product if more Malaysians were educated on its goodness. \nPFC managing director Datuk Zainal Bachik said under the new formula, known as Santan Sawit Plus, the shelf life can increase to 10 months in room temperature, from a month previously.\n“There is potential for it in Indonesia, where up to 1,000 tonnes of coconut milk are being consumed monthly, and we aim to start selling there by next year,” he added. \nHe said the company was targeting sales of palm milk to reach RM12mil a year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:30:55.636+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
