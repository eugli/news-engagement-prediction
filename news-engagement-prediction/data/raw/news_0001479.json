ANDY JACKSON/FAIRFAX NZ \nRussia will ban NZ beef imports from Monday after it says contaminants were found. \nThe watchdog, known as Rosselkhoznadzor in Russian, said it was also considering banning fish imports from New Zealand due to traces of mercury in some supplies. \n* Russian trade threat ongoing \nChief executive of the Meat Industry Association Tim Ritchie said the additive, which is used to promote leanness and muscle growth, was prohibited in beef or sheep feed in New Zealand, but was allowed in pork. \n\"As far as I'm aware there has been no formal communication through the normal regulatory channels,\" Ritchie said. \nHe said the Ministry for Primary Industries ran a residues programme and the last report he had seen showed no ractopamine had been picked up. \nNew Zealand's red meat trade to Russia was worth $24.6 million in 2016. The largest proportion of that was beef livers, which earned $9.5m. \nIn 2014 New Zealand came close to signing a free trade agreement with Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan before the Crimean and Ukraine crises put negotiations on hold. Ad Feedback \nNew Zealand is not covered by a wider ban on most Western food imports which Moscow introduced in 2014 in retaliation for Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis. \nHowever former Prime Minister John Key said in 2015 New Zealand should \"show solidarity\" with European Union and other Western countries that had applied sanctions on Russia, while NZ First leader Winston Peters said New Zealand should be \"pragmatic and prosperous\" rather than \"principled and poor\". \nMPI is investigating the latest contamination issue. \nRussia has a history of limiting imports in trade disputes. It has banned meat supplies from other countries in previous years, due to traces of ractopamine which is banned in several countries, including Russia and China. \nThe head of Russia's watchdog Sergei Dankvert plans to meet with an official from Brazil's Agricultural Protection Unit Luis Eduardo Pacifici Rangel in Moscow on February 3, Rosselkhoznadzor said in a separate statement earlier on Thursday. \nBoth officials plan to discuss cooperation in veterinary and phytosanitory issues, it added. Brazil is a major global meat exporter. - Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T04:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T00:05:41.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
