Photo: Paul J. Richards/AFP/Getty Images The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has rejected a request by the Trump Administration for an emergency stay that would immediately restore President Trump’s travel ban executive order, which was blocked with a temporary restraining order by a federal judge in Washington State on Friday. On Saturday, the Trump administration had asked the appeals court to reinstate the ban, which barred the citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries and all refugees from entering the U.S., pending their planned appeal, but the court quickly denied the request very early Sunday morning. The next phase of the legal battle over the travel ban will start on Monday, when the Trump Administration’s reply to the appeals court is due. In the meantime, federal agencies are respecting the judge’s order blocking the ban, and all travelers with valid U.S. visas are able to travel to the U.S.\nTags: travel ban donald trump politics federal courts Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Trump Says Judge and U.S. Court System Deserve Blame ‘If Something Happens’ Trump Administration Suspends Travel Ban Pending Appeal, Trump Attacks Judge Appeals Court Rejects Request to Restore Travel Ban, For Now Most Viewed Stories White House Denies Report That Bannon Had to Be Reminded He Wasn’t President Amidst Travel Ban Chaos A Brief History of ‘Cash Me Outside, Howbow Dah?’ Someone Give Melissa McCarthy an Emmy for Her Screamin’ Good Sean Spicer Impression Sean Spicer Chews and Swallows 35 Pieces of Gum Every Day Before Noon Ivanka Trump’s Brand Issues an Even Longer Response to Nordstrom News Every Super Bowl Halftime Show Since 1993, Ranked from Worst to Best It’s Bustin’ Time in the First Look at Stranger Things Season Two New Yorkers Use Hand Sanitizer to Remove Subway Swastika Vandalism Kristen Stewart Drops a Live F-Bomb, Mocks Donald Trump, and Announces That She’s ‘So Gay, Dude’ in Grand Trifecta SNL Monologue What’s New on Netflix: February 2017 Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The ‘Black Bloc’ Protesters Revealed Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 4:53 p.m. Trump Says Judge and U.S. Court System Deserve Blame ‘If Something Happens’ Once again, Trump seems unable to tolerate a key branch of America’s government.\n11:05 a.m. Trump Administration Suspends Travel Ban Pending Appeal, Trump Attacks Judge Airlines have told travelers that they are free to board flights to the U.S., but how long the opportunity will last remains unclear.\n8:47 a.m. Appeals Court Rejects Request to Restore Travel Ban, For Now The Justice Department’s request for an emergency stay that would have reinstated the travel ban pending the government’s appeal was denied.\nYesterday at 8:09 p.m. European Magazines Go Dark with Their Trump Covers Several magazine publishers have turned their covers into some pretty ominous political poster art.\nYesterday at 4:47 p.m. White House Backing Down on Renewed Use of Torture, Black Sites They still intend to expand the use of the prison at Guantánamo Bay, however.\nYesterday at 3:26 p.m. White House Denies Report That Bannon Had to Be Reminded He Wasn’t President Leaks and alleged infighting seem to have become staples of the White House reality show.\n2/3/2017 at 11:45 p.m. Seattle Judge Smacks Down Trump Travel Ban–For Now A judge is setting up a serious trial of Trump’s immigration policies, and the White House is already vowing to fight back.\n2/3/2017 at 6:31 p.m. Every Terrifying Thing That Donald Trump Did This Week All the norms the president has already destroyed.\n2/3/2017 at 6:19 p.m. California Is Wondering If Trump and Sessions Will Relaunch the War on Drugs An anti-drug administration in D.C. may soon collide with a huge constituency for legal cannabis.
