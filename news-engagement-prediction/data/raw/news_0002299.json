Sat, 04/02/2017 - 10:45am \nDear Editors, \nThis man Steve Erwin is selling exotic and maybe endangered animals as pets in Singapore. He lists iguanas, lizards, tortoises, snakes and even tarantula spiders for sale on his facebook account. Advertisement \nI think this is cruel and most likely illegal eh? Some of these animals look v special and may be on the endangered list of animals which need our protection. What are the authorities doing to shut this unethical seller down? \nSome other kind souls have reported this man but he called them busybodies and said he will continue to sell through other avenues. This is his fb post, AVA or SPCA please check this out! \n\"Selling all types of EXOTIC PETS in Singapore No deposit required. Contact: 83107814 Steve for more details. WHATSAPP only. \nALSO DON'T BE A BUSYBODY AND REPORT. I WILL JUST CONTINUE DOING ANOTHER POST. OR POST IN OTHER SITES. get a life. Dont waste time. Thanks.\" \nTina Liew", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T09:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:42:24.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
