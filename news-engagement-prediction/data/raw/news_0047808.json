Post-production on the film is in full swing, and today we have a fresh behind the scenes look: Hey kids, this is how movies get their final look. In a digital intermediate suite, shot by shot. No ‘filters’. #funfact #filmschoolfriday pic.twitter.com/XZlxzi46xQ — Larry Fong (@larryfong) February 17, 2017 \nLarry Fong, the cinematographer best known for his collaborations with Zack Snyder on movies from 300 to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice , shared the above image on his personal Twitter page - copying a photo from one of Snyder's personal social media profiles. The image comes from one of the post-production suites on Justice League , with each frame being individually analyzed and properly adjusted for look and quality. The frame that \"Stefan\" is working on at the moment the snap was taken looks like it comes from a Batman fight sequence, but what's particularly interesting is that it appears that the Dark Knight is fighting a trio of robots. \nThe natural question here is, \"Why is Batman fighting robots?\" It's a reasonable question given that the Justice League movie's main villain is set to be Steppenwolf, who commands a horde of monstrous Parademons, not killer machines. So what's the explanation? One possibility is that this is actually part of a training sequence, where Batman is in a special part of the Batcave working on his moves. Another option is that there is a secondary threat in the blockbuster that we don't know about yet. And finally, we can't rule out that the Caped Crusader is actually just fighting people who look kind of weird because of the angle of the photo and the fact that the image is on a monitor. \nWhat doesn't help anything is the fact that we really don't know much about the plot of Justice League . As noted, Steppenwolf is set up as the primary antagonist, and a good portion of the narrative will certainly be dedicated to Batman and Wonder Woman collecting other powerful heroes to protect the world from devastating threats. Anything else beyond that, however, is basically a giant question mark. Obviously we still have a long time to wait until the movie actually comes out, so we may learn why Batman is battling robots a month or two from now... but it's not hard to hope that's a mystery that remains until the film is on the big screen. \nJustice League wrapped production last year and has since been deep in the editing process. The movie is set to be released on November 17th - just in time for Thanksgiving - and you can be sure to find all the latest updates about the project regularly here on CinemaBlend.
