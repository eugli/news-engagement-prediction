Bernie Sanders has his dank meme stash . Ed Miliband has Milifandom . \nNow, German politician Martin Schulz has his own meme-making enthusiasts, who are supporting his bid to be German chancellor. Welcome to the world of r/The_Schulz . \nMemes have become a strange currency in politics. When Trump was elected, someone on 4chan wrote: “We actually elected a meme as president” . Whether they really make a difference to a campaign is debated. After all, liberal memes will spread in liberal circles, and vice versa for the right . But they’re now an inevitable part of political discourse on the internet. \nJust as the fake news debate has arrived in Germany in time for the Bundestag elections, so too have high-profile political memes. The moderators of The Schulz dub the subreddit as “semi-serious satire”, kickstarted when the former president of the European parliament announced he was standing down in order to seek a seat in Germany’s Bundestag. \nLike many in the German and international media, moderator Derausmwaldkam, who preferred to remain anonymous, said they anticipated Schulz’s return to German politics would mean a bid for chancellor. It also came at a time when the Trump-supporting subreddit, r/the_Donald , was “at its peak” in spamming Reddit’s front page. \n“We wanted to do a mocking satire of those right-wing subs by copying their style and methods, but full of friendship and pro-Europe stuff instead of the general hate, fake news, conspiracies etc.” \nSchulz memes tend to be wholesome in nature. The main image dominating the sub is a riff on the Obama “hope” poster. Others play with established memes, portraying Schulz as a man of the people and, well, pretty cool . \nTheir catchphrases include: “Make Europe Great Again” (MEGA) and references to the unstoppable Schulz train with “keine Bremsen” (no brakes). An example of a post on r/The_Schulz, a subreddit dedicated to German chancellor candidate Martin Schulz. Photograph: r/The_Schulz \nPart of the reason he has become so popular is because Schulz was fairly unknown in the sphere of political internet memes. According to Derausemwald, many Germans knew of Schulz only from an incident when he kicked out a Golden Dawn member from the European parliament for calling Turkish people “wild dogs”. \n“As he was so unknown to many, it was easy to create a positive picture of him, of his “new” ideas. He didn’t have that negative background of being a ‘like every other politician’.” Screengrab of r/The_Schulz, a subreddit dedicated to Martin Schulz, leader of SPD Photograph: r/The_Schulz \nAs with the best memes, they’re not restricted to one social platform. An account called @keinebremsen regularly posts Schulz memes on Twitter.
