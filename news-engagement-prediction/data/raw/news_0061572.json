Despite drawing the No. 7 seed, Kwon advanced out of District 2 as a third-place finisher. Now, the heavyweight is still alive and heading to the quarterfinals after earning a 5-3 decision over West Milford’s Eric Lindstrom. Kwon, arguably one of the biggest cinderella stories in the state, will try to keep his run going against Drew Flynn of Pompton Lakes, a champion out of District 4. \nUpset of the night : Despite trailing 4-0 in the third period, Ramapo’s Luke Brantly found a way to eliminate a Hunterdon/Warren/Sussex champion. Brantly chose neutral to start the third period and pinned Kittatinny’s Shane Smith to advance to the 160-pound quarterfinals. Brantly, a sophomore who is 24-16, will face District 2 champion Reece Mulduun next. \nWayne Hills trifecta : All four qualifiers from Wayne Hills were in action in the first round and all four advanced to the quarterfinals, including three wrestlers in a row from 182-220. At 182, Justin Ramirez earned a 7-1 decision over Ramsey’s Ross Woods while Christopher Buzelli and Pete Dellechiaie both won by fall at 195 and 220, respectively. Anthony Rua (138( was another first-round winner for the Patriots. \nTo the wire : One of the most exciting matches of the night was between Old Tappan’s Ryan Foy and Sparta’s Paddy Finnegan at 170. In a back-and-forth bout, Foy got a takedown in rideouts to earn an 8-6 decision. The prize? A pairing with Don Bosco’s Dom Mandarino, a two-time state medalist in the quarterfinals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T11:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T09:38:24.618+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
