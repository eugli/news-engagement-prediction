Juli Glisson, 40, is charged with aggravated vehicular homicide after allegedly putting her parked car into drive. (Metropolitan Nashville PD) \nTemperatures in Nashville were in the high 30s, according to National Weather Service data, with strong currents reported in the Cumberland. \nInvestigators believe that Glisson, who was allegedly threatening to kill herself, was able to swim from her car to the riverbank, and she remained hospitalized as of Friday afternoon. \nThe fallen officer’s body was found in the river several hours later. Emergency workers search for Mumaw in the Cumberland River on Thursday. (AP) \nGlisson was legally drunk behind the wheel, according to police, who said they would arrest her for the homicide charge when she is discharged from medical care. \nSkeletal remains found in Tenn. identified as missing soldier \nShe was on probation for a drunk driving arrest last April. \nMemorial services will be held for Mumaw, who previously received a “Lifesaving Award” for saving a sword attack victim, on Monday. \nA Change.org petition has also called for the riverside park where the incident happened to be renamed Mumaw Park.
