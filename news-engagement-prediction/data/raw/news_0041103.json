Any EastEnders fans wondering whether Michelle Fowler’s underage student secret had been conveniently brushed under the carpet were given their answer tonight when American Lester rocked up with a corner shop box of chocolates and a sloppy smooch for his older lover. \nMichelle had to leave the US after her affair with the 17-year-old was exposed given that it is illegal both due to his age and the fact that he was technically a student under her care. \nBut she has insisted that they were in love – something which seems to be two sided as Lester has followed her and managed to track her down to Walford. (Picture: BBC) \nHaving waited outside the Fowlers’ for her, he stunned her by emerging from the shadows but it was only a few seconds before they had their arms around each other and were engaging in a furious kiss. \nBut how will Michelle’s loved ones and neighbours react to Lester’s arrival? And will he stick around? \nEastEnders continues on Thursday 16 February at 7:30pm on BBC One.
