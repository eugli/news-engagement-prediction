Only now are you seeing the fruits of their labours — it’s taken a long time. \n“Paul Roos went into Melbourne and said ‘what are we going to do here? I’m going to stop the bleeding’. He tried to shore up the defence, slow the game style and didn’t worry so much about the attacking.” Carlton coach Brendon Bolton on Saturday.

Marc Murphy made a successful return from injury on Saturday. Picture: Wayne Ludbey.   \nBar Levi Casboult, Carlton’s key forward stocks are young and inexperienced, though what they do have is a raft of early draft picks at their disposal. \nIn addition to recruiting Jack Silvagni via the father-son rule in the 2015 draft, the Blues picked up Harry McKay (Pick 10) and Charlie Curnow (Pick 12). All three have shown glimpses of their potential as they continue their development up forward. \nTHE FINAL PIECE \nAS Carlton set about recruiting its bookends for the next decade in 2015, the focus during last year’s trade period turned to the midfield. \nMelbourne — along with the likes of reigning premiers the Western Bulldogs — have exemplified the benefits of building a deep midfield. \nOn Saturday, a reasonably young Blues on-ball brigade was simply overrun by the Demons, recording deficits in virtually every statistical category. \nIt was an effort that left former Hawthorn great Jason Dunstall slamming the showing of Carlton’s midfielders, labelling their performance “an indictment” on their workrate. \nBut with the likes of Marc Murphy and Bryce Gibbs leading the way, the Blues still have an experienced core that they can rotate through the middle. \nPatrick Cripps, who missed the weekend’s game with a back injury, leads the younger brigade, with fellow West Australians Sam Petrevski-Seton (Pick 6) and Zac Fisher (Pick 27) chosen first by the Blues during last year’s draft. \nAccording to Watson, building that midfield depth through the draft should remain a priority for the club in the years to come. \n“Obviously there’s a lot of work to do around the ball,” Watson said. \n“Every side needs to have a powerful engine in this game and that’s what they have to rebuild. \n“They’re trying to rebuild their spine at the same time. There’s a lot of work going on in terms of the renovation of this list, before they build themselves a sustainable base.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:19:17.859+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
