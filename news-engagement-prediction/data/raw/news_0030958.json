The “Hello” singer had returned to the stage to pay homage to the late George Michael with a rendition of his song, “Fastlove,” but early on, it appeared she was reliving her 2016 Grammy’s nightmare when she started to sound off-key. Right before hitting the chorus, Adele stopped the performance, dropped an f-bomb, and said to the crowd: “I’m sorry for swearing and I’m sorry for starting again,” before adding: “I’m sorry, I can’t mess this up for him.” She then began the song all over and soldiered on until she eventually earned a standing ovation from the crowd. Adele's unexpected hiccup during the Grammy's ended up affirming why we love the candid singer so much: She’s human like all of the rest of us.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T12:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T07:31:06.055+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
