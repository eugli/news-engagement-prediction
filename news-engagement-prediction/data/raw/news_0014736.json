I am looking for breakfast bars! Do you have breakfast bars?? Breakfast bars!!”. \nIn case you missed it, breakfast bars are “meal replacement” snacks, otherwise called granola bars. \nIt is made with oats, nuts, milk and syrup. \nNot getting an answer he liked from the first employee he queried, the Hulk grew more agitated and stormed his shopping cart down the aisle, asking anyone he thought looked like an employee. \n“BRRRREAK - FAST BARRRSSS?!” \nThis was shouted in that rude manner, where the person not speaking the local language just repeat themselves loudly in English as though this will magically make others understand. \nReflexively, I started looking for breakfast bars... until I heard these words spilling out of his mouth: \n“With the amount of cheap labour out here, you would think someone could speak English!”. \nHis meanness got me wondering how anyone living abroad could be such a total plonk. \nBut in the same week at another supermarket, I encountered a Malaysian woman who was just as infuriating. \nI approached an empty lane at the checkout where the cashier was finishing ringing up items from a very large order. \nFirst of all, it was surprising that her RM1,000+ order was being put in plastic bags that had supposedly been banned at the start of the year. \nAs the cashier scanned the last item on the conveyor belt, she gave me an apologetic look and suggested I go to the next lane. \nI did not mind waiting, I said, as the other tills were equally busy with long lines and as she had finished ringing up the last item the customer only had to pay. \nBut then she mumbled an apology... and stuck the “Closed” sign on her counter! \nApparently, the customer just left her shopping cart with the cashier and wandered off! \nSo I was forced to the back of the next line and was obviously annoyed by this. \nStill, I was curious to see just who this inconsiderate shopper was. \nAfter a minute, a Datin-looking “VIP” strolled languidly back to her trolley, with a few more items in one hand while scrolling through her phone messages with the other. \nWithout batting a fake eyelash, she dropped her things on the “closed” counter... then turned around and went back into the supermarket! \nOf course I had to hang around to see how this turned out. \nWhen she finally finished paying for everything, she casually ordered a security guard – a security guard! – to watch over her cart stuffed with grocery bags as she then promenaded off to a different area of the shopping centre for something else! \nAll of this while still on her phone. \nThese incidents brought home for me the fact that people can be bullies wherever they are from. \nFrom browsing social media interactions of the recent developments in countries around the world, I know that trying to engage in a conversation with folks entrenched in their views isn’t going to change anyone’s outlook. \nBut rather than just being angry with these folks, I have decided on trying to be a better person in society. \nSelf-absorbed, mean people aren’t likely to change. \nAnd if living in Malaysia for the last three years has taught me anything is that I can learn to recognise and tamp down this same behaviour in myself. \nLast week, I ran into a lovely old lady at the supermarket in Bangsar. She was explaining to one of the staff that she wanted to grow mint. \nShe had been sent to the vegetable section and was earnestly asking them if she could grow a mint plant from the bagged mint leaves she was holding. \nDismayed at the lack of information she was getting, I picked up a packet of mint seeds from the herb section and introduced myself to her. \n“Aunty, in my experience, you can try to grow a plant from the stalks, and if you have rooting hormone at home, you will increase your chances. \n“But a better bet would be to start a new plant from seed.” \nWe proceeded to have a nice chat, she thanked me, I thanked her, and we went our separate ways. \nPerhaps 2017 won’t be quite so filled with rudeness after all.
