But for those expecting him to achieve it at the French Open are surely to be disappointed as the Swiss Maestro admits he has a better chance of winning a title at his favourite grass-court tournament Wimbledon than in Paris. \nAlso Read: Is Roger Federer's Career Ending Soon? Swiss Legend Leaves Fans Guessing After Clinching Australian Open \n\"Wimbledon over Roland Garros yes, then the US Open. On the grass I've got a lot of tournaments there, I play Stuttgart and Halle. So Wimbledon, I know I have a better shot,\" Federer was quoted as saying by the Daily Mail on Tuesday. \"At the US Open actually I also think I have a good chance to do well there, but let's enjoy this one first.\" \nAP \nFederer took six months off tennis as part of his aim to fully recover from a knee surgery that saw him missing the 2016 Rio Olympics, US Open and World Tour Finals. He is now reaping rich dividends, winning his first Grand Slam title in five years. \nAnd despite being awfully tired, he danced all night celebrating his famous five-set victory over Nadal. \nAP \n\"That's why I took the six months off, to hopefully still be playing for a couple of years. I am very tired right now, my legs hurt like mad and my back's stiff too because I didn't take any treatment, plus I was dancing last night. I'm still on a high, I'm going to crash eventually but that's OK. And in a week's time I think the pain in my legs will go away,\" he said. \nFederer terms his win as special because this is the first time he'll be celebrating a Grand Slam title win with his second set of twins. \nAP \n\"This is my first Slam win with the boys, so that's special. The girls were just super-excited to see the trophy. I saw them this morning. As I walked in, they woke up. They were all in such a good mood as they woke up and I came in with the trophy. It was an amazing half-hour right there,\" he said. Don't Miss ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:27:38.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
