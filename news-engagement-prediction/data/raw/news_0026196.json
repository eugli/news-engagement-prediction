Professor John Middleton, president of the UK Faculty of Public Health, said: ‘It is time for diesel to be recognised as the health emergency that it is. LABOUR SAID IT WAS 'GREEN' UNDER BLAIR Under Tony Blair’s Labour government generous tax breaks were used to persuade millions of drivers to buy diesel cars. Low-sulphur diesel duty was cut by 3p in chancellor Gordon Brown’s 2001 Budget to reward diesel drivers. The tactic aimed to help Britain hit EU carbon emissions targets. It was claimed at the time that diesel cars were greener because they generated less carbon dioxide than petrol vehicles. But scientists now say diesel cars are actually worse for the environment and a bigger health risk than petrol vehicles because they emit larger amounts of toxic nitrogen oxide, which has been linked to respiratory diseases. ‘Diesel is the primary source of nitrogen dioxide in urban areas and is linked to health effects that begin before birth and extend throughout life, from childhood lung development and asthma, to increased risk of heart disease, stroke, lung cancer and dementia.’ Ownership of diesel cars has more than trebled in the last 15 years – driven by misguided government tax incentives that identified diesel as a ‘green’ fuel. Almost 1.3million new diesels were registered last year, 48 per cent of all car purchases, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Evidence is growing about the health impacts of nitrogen dioxide and the tiny particles of soot emitted by diesel engines. These toxins add to pollution from factories and power plants to create a deadly smog. But while tough industrial regulations have driven down factory emissions – these advances have barely made a difference to pollution levels because of the increasing number of diesel cars on the road. Scientists now believe a typical diesel vehicle emits ten times as much nitrogen dioxide as a petrol equivalent. The UK is notoriously bad at controlling air pollution, with 37 cities across Britain persistently breaching legal limits of air toxins set by the EU. NHS watchdog NICE in December warned air pollution now contributes towards 5 per cent of all deaths in England, and called for a reduction in speed limits and traffic to be restricted around schools. Fumes and toxins from diesel cars are already contributing to smog which has been linked to the deaths of 40,000 people a year. Stock image London is already planning to introduce an ‘emission zone’ which diesel drivers would be charged to enter, and other cities are set to follow suit. But experts are desperate to find new ways to rein in the damage done by pollution, after legal annual limits for pollution were breached in the first week of January. Motorists in Westminster have been told they may soon be charged 50 per cent extra for on-street parking in a diesel. And Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, proposed a £3,500 scrappage scheme to encourage drivers to switch to petrol or electric cars earlier this week. Professor Jonathan Grigg, of Queen Mary University of London and founding member of Doctors Against Diesel, said: ‘There is overwhelming evidence that locally generated sooty particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide is harming children’s health. ‘Cutting diesel emissions would therefore have an immediate impact on children’s personal exposure, and improve their long-term health.’ A Government spokesman said: ‘We’re committed to improving air quality and cutting harmful emissions. We’ve committed more than £2billion since 2011 to increase the uptake of ultra-low emissions vehicles, to support greener transport and set out how we’ll improve air quality.’ Share or comment on this article Most watched News videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:30:13.872+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
