RICH MEN NEVER LEARN   \nDear A.S.S. Editor Advertisement \nHoward Shaw is back in the courts for yet another drink driving offence! This is going to be the third time that he is charged in court for drink driving offences. He already has two previous convictions, according to court documents, once on Feb 19, 1997 and another on Jan 26, 2006. \nIf after three times and you are still caught driving while drunk, then there is something seriously wrong with him. He is not only being a danger to himself, but to other road users too. Hope this rich man will finally learn his lesson. Meantime, he should not be allowed to be driving on the roads. \nColin H \nA.S.S. Contributor Editor's Note: \nIf not, why not give us a 'Like' ?
