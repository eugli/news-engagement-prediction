The last new hotels to open in the city were the Shangri-La Hotel in 2009 and the Fairmont Pacific Rim Hotel in 2010.\nThe Rosewood Hotel Georgia reopened following extensive renovations in 2011. It changed ownership four years prior, when it was operating as the Crowne Plaza Hotel Georgia.\nThe public relations firm representing the Trump tower has not responded to a request for clarification.\nProtest planned for grand opening \nTwo of Trump's sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, are coming to town for the grand opening Tuesday, and protesters are planning to give the family a \"hearty West Coast welcome.\"\nHundreds of Facebook users have indicated they'll be gathering outside the hotel for a protest starting at 10 a.m. and continuing into the evening. Organizers promise there will be DJs and live music from local artists beginning at 3 p.m.\nThe Vancouver Police Department confirmed it's expecting marches that will disrupt traffic on Georgia Street, and that drivers planning to take the route should allow themselves extra time to get around.\nThere will be a visible police presence at the hotel over the course of the day to keep the peace, Const. Jason Doucette said.\n\"Our priority is ensuring Vancouver is a safe place to live, work, and visit,\" Doucette told CTV News in an email.\nThe Trump-branded tower, owned by Holborn Developments, has already been a lightning rod for controversy in Vancouver, where even city officials have expressed displeasure at having the controversial U.S. president's name on the skyline.\nIt has also been the site of a number of protests, both before and after Trump's election victory.\nWith files from CTV Vancouver's Penny Daflos and Sarah MacDonald\nRelated Stories Trump tower opens in Vancouver but the welcome isn't warm Photos A tweet from The Trump Organization left many Vancouver residents scratching their heads on Monday, Feb. 27, 2017.
