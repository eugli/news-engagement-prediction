To ensure your AVG Antivirus provides full protection at all times, the AVG team analyzes new threats and information regarding new viruses, releasing updated virus definitions and antivirus improvements periodically. The installer is suggestively called AVG Anti-Virus Definitions , which deploys the updated package of virus definitions that can be loaded into the AVG Antivirus when an Internet connection is not available or the built-in definition update function fails to work. It is highly advisable to update the signatures from within the antivirus, if possible. This option is available in the tray context menu of AVG and ensures that the security software compares scan results to an up-to-date signature database, so as to detect both known and recent threats. Performing the updates from within the AVG Antivirus has an additional advantage: the antivirus recognizes signatures already included in its database and performs differential downloads and updates, which obviously take less time to complete. On the other hand, manual updates using the AVG Anti-Virus Definitions package requires more time and can only be performed in full. In order to manually add updates to your AVG Antivirus, you must save the installer to your computer, then access the Options menu and use the 'Update from folder' option to select the BIN file.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T12:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T08:07:57.127+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
