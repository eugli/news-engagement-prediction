Alas, the roses have thorns and validation doesn’t come easily for everyone. Luckily, Skip Marley is there to enlighten those willing to listen. WELCOME TO 🎢🎡🎠OBLIVIA🎠🎢🎡 WHERE EVERYTHING IS ALWAYS ROSY: https://t.co/X1vMe9s3zS Directed by Mathew Cullen FT @SkipMarley #CTTRVIDEO 🥀 pic.twitter.com/E6pJ0IztME \nThe video, directed by Matthew Cullen, was filmed at California’s Six Flags Magic Mountain last month, according to Billboard. \nIt comes weeks after the single’s release , complete with lyrics like “So put your rose-colored glasses on / And party on / Turn it up, it’s your favorite song / Dance, dance, dance to the distortion / Come on, turn it up, keep it on repeat / Stumbling around like a wasted zombie.” \nView the whole video here: \nAfter Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election, Perry wrote about how campaigning on Clinton’s behalf and then facing a stark new reality helped her find her voice. \nFrom the outside it probably looks as though I’ve always had a “voice.” Truth is, I have never had one like I have found in the past year. I have a found a new voice, a more determined voice. I grew up sheltered, suppressed and kept silent for fear of giving the wrong answer. I would reveal my poor education. Or I was just scared. Hillary helped me see that we’re all in this together, no matter where we come from, what color we are, or what status and education we have or don’t have. Hillary lit a fire inside of me that burns brighter and brighter every day, and that fire will NEVER be put out. Feelings of despair still comes in waves, but now more than ever I am MOTIVATED to fight against social injustice and to promote equality and kindness as best I know how, through my art and influence.
