Sen. Patty Murray: Confirmation of U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is being rushed through while major questions remain about the billionaire nominee's finances and potential conflicts of interest. Photo: SEATTLEPI.COM Murray and Cantwell say they are being misled, blast Trump Cabinet picks 1 / 2 Back to Gallery \nThe U.S. Senate can't do its duty vetting President Trump's Cabinet nominees if questions are left \"unanswered,\" senators are \"misled\" and key conflict of interest issues are left on the table, Sens. Maria Cantwell and Patty Murray, D-Wash., argued Tuesday. \nThe result was a show of acrimony among people who, in the past, have overcome differences and worked in harmony. \nSen. Murray worked with GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, on the bipartisan plan that fixed the flawed Bush-era No Child Left Behind law. On Tuesday, she blistered Alexander for holding just one hearing on Secretary of Education-designate Betsy DeVos before the billionaire nominee's holdings were vetted. \n\"Chairman Alexander, I have said to you privately already -- we have simply not been given all of the information we need to make a decision as Senators charged with robustly scrutinizing the President's nominees,\" Murray told Alexander, who chairs the Senate Education Committee. \nSen. Cantwell and other Democrats boycotted a Senate Finance Committee hearing on the nomination of hedge fund entrepreneur Steven Mnuchin as U.S. Treasury Secretary and Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, as Secretary of Health and Human Services. \n\"Questions were left unanswered and members were misled,\" Cantwell tweeted. \nMnuchin and Price have come under critical scrutiny in the press. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Price had received a privileged offer to purchase biomedical stock at a discount, even though he has denied to Congress that this was the case. \nThe Columbus Dispatch broke a story Sunday that Mnuchin provided false testimony at a Senate confirmation hearing last week, saying that OneWest Bank -- where he was chairman and CEO -- had not robo-signed documents. But the paper found thousands of foreclosure cases that were robo-signed. \n\"Our committee has critically important questions that remain outstanding and they must be addressed,\" said Cantwell. \"With so much at stake, the American people deserve answers.\" \nThe DeVos nomination made it out of committee on a party line 12-11 vote. A pair of Republicans lawmakers, Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, have yet to commit that they will vote on the floor for her confirmation. \nMurray is opposed to DeVos because the nominee is a longtime advocate for diverting public school resources to charter schools and education vouchers. But the DeVos nomination received only a single hearing at which each senator had only five minutes to ask questions. \n\"Ms. DeVos is a billionaire with extraordinarily complicated and opaque finances,\" said Murray, both in her own holdings as well as those of her immediate family. \"She has invested in education companies for decades Her ethics paperwork raises a significant number of questions about the companies she plans to remain invested in ... \n\"She has refused to answer basic questions about her finances that would allow us to make sure that she won't continue to have serious conflicts of interest were she confirmed.\" \nCantwell is also opposed to DeVos. \nShe announced Tuesday her opposition to three more Trump cabinet picks -- ex-Texas Gov. Rick Perry as U.S. Secretary of Energy, Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke to be Secretary of the Interior, and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama to be Attorney General. \nOf Sessions, her colleague in the Senate for 16 years, Cantwell said: \"I will vote No on Senator Sessions. He has blocked safeguards for voting rights, protection of women from domestic violence, and LGBTQ rights.\" \n", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:05:26.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
