(Muneyoshi Someya/Kyodo News via AP)\nThe missile is believed to have splashed down into the sea between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters the missile did not hit Japanese territorial seas. The North conducted two nuclear tests and a slew of rocket launches last year in continued efforts to expand its nuclear weapons and missile programs. Kim Jong-un said in his New Year's address that the country has reached the final stages of readiness to test an ICBM, which would be a major step forward in its efforts to build a credible nuclear threat to the United States.\nThough Pyongyang has been relatively quiet about the transfer of power to the Trump administration, its state media has repeatedly called for Washington to abandon its \"hostile policy\" and vowed to continue its nuclear and missile development programs until the U.S. changes its diplomatic approach.\nAnalysts divided on North's progress Just days ago, it also reaffirmed its plan to conduct more space launches, which it staunchly defends but which have been criticized because they involve duel-use technology that can be transferred to improve missiles.\nKim Dong-yeop, an analyst at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, speculated the projectile could be a Musudan or a similar rocket designed to test engines for an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the U.S. mainland. Analysts are divided, however, over how close the North is to having a reliable long-range rocket that could be coupled with a nuclear warhead capable to striking U.S. targets.\nSouth Korea's Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn vowed to 'ensure a corresponding response to punish the North.' (Lee Sang-hack/Yonhap via AP)\nSouth Korea's Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn said that his country will punish North Korea for the missile launch. He did not elaborate.\n\"Our government, in tandem with the international community, is doing its best to ensure a corresponding response to punish the North,\" Hwang said.\nÂ© The Associated Press, 2017", "external_links": ["http://www.cp.org/"], "published": "2017-02-12T04:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T05:52:49.405+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
