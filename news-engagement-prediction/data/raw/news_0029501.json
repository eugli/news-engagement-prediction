By moumita bhattacharjee | Updated: February 14, 2017 6:11 pm Kareena Kapoor’s girl gang, Malaika Arora Khan, Amrita Arora rush to meet the actress, is she due anytime? \nKareena Kapoor Khan is a woman we can talk about for hours. The way she handled her pregnancy is simply aspirational. Hardly do you see would-be celeb mothers making too many social and public appearances but not Kareena. She was everywhere and we were so glad she decided to do that. Now that she has delivered her baby boy Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, Kareena seems to be in a hurry to get rid of the post-pregnancy weight as soon as possible. In fact, the actress wants to get back to the diet she took up to look really lean in Tashan. Yes, the actress herself admitted to it. (Also read: Time to DITCH red girls! Deepika Padukone, Kareena Kapoor Khan, Priyanka Chopra show you how to flaunt colours this Valentine’s Day ) \nKareena went live on Facebook along with her dietician Rujuta Diwekar where she spoke about her eagerness to shed the extra weight. She said, “After pregnancy, I was like let’s do that (Tashan diet). Rujuta said no we can’t do that because we are in too much progression. So no crash diet, it’s a gradual process and we are building the body for that.” Well as much as we loved you in that avatar Kareena, we don’t think we would love to see you like that again. You don’t need to get that almost skinny look because you look breathtakingly gorgeous always. It is definitely an inspiration that you are trying to lose the extra weight but to go back to Tashan figure will be a little too much. Don’t you think so? \nKareena is getting into a rigorous exercise regime as well, may be because she will be debuting on television very soon. In fact, reports suggest, she got a whopping Rs. 12 crore for her TV debut. An insider in an interaction with Hindustan Times spilled the beans stating, “The brand was keen to have her on board as she was not only well known globally but was also very popular in London, UK. She shot for two days for the ad, taking home a cool pay packet of Rs 12 crore, which is unheard of. She is definitely one of the highest paid actors bagging this sum, if not the highest.” Guess all this is done to get in shape for the show!", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T19:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T15:02:09.359+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
