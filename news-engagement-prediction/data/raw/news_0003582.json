By Susan Svrluga By Susan Svrluga February 1 at 10:07 PM Follow @SusanSvrluga \nMilo Yiannopoulos (Mike Allen) \nAmid intense protests, the University of California at Berkeley canceled a talk by provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and put the campus on lockdown Wednesday night. \nYiannopoulos, an inflammatory and sought-after speaker who writes for the Breitbart website, triggered a fiery protest Wednesday. \nHe has a large following as a self-proclaimed “free-speech fundamentalist” crusading against political correctness. He was banned from Twitter this summer after sending tweets targeting a black actress. \nSome schools have canceled or indefinitely postponed his appearances because they often generate such intense responses. \nThat leads some to argue that his speech is being censored. Others counter that universities aren’t required to pay security and other expenses when students invite speakers. \nWith free speech an exceptionally volatile issue on campuses across the country — with debate over code words, safe spaces, implicit bias, microagressions, and free-speech — his events have become flash points. \nHis cross-country tour touched off intense opposition in Berkeley. \n“Amid violence, destruction of property and out of concern for public safety, the University of California Police Department determined that it was necessary to remove Milo Yiannopoulos from the campus and to cancel tonight’s scheduled 8 p.m. performance,” the university announced Wednesday night. The decision was made about two hours before the event, to a crowd of more than 1,500 protesters gathered outside the venue. \nYiannopoulos was escorted away and left the campus, according to the university, which condemned, “in the strongest possible terms the violence and unlawful behavior that was on display and deeply regret that those tactics will now overshadow the efforts to engage in legitimate and lawful protest against the performer’s presence and perspectives.” Anti-fascist protesters against Milo hunkering down behind shields as UC Berkeley police shoot non lethal bullets. pic.twitter.com/jGOcBa9KUC \n— Shane Bauer (@shane_bauer) February 2, 2017 Milo protesters start fire at UC Berkeley.
