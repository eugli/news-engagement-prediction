In fact, in his first season with Florida, Reimer has almost identical numbers to Panthers No. 1 Roberto Luongo.\nLuongo: 2.53 goals-against average, .919 save percentage in 33 Starts Reimer : 2.50 goals-against average, .918 save percentage in 19 Starts\nThe reliable backup goaltender is an especially valuable commodity in the NHL this season given the compressed schedule that sees most teams now playing every other night until mid-April. Employing one goaltender under such strain risks not only poor performance, but injury.\nBig save by James Reimer: pic.twitter.com/kDJmw8rzWp\nâ€” @Cats0ntheprowl Bruins No. 1 Tuukka Rask, for instance, has started 44 of 55 games this year and he's not only stumbled with increasing use (.891 save percentage since Dec. 1), but had to leave a game last week with a groin issue.\nCam Talbot has been remarkably consistent for Edmonton despite starting an NHL-leading 49 games, but can he hold up down the stretch? The Oilers, chasing their first playoff berth since 2006, have to hope so with his expected backup, Jonas Gustavsson, now playing in the minors.\nOther backups delivering above-average performance beyond Reimer this year include: Buffalo's Anders Nilsson (.923 save percentage in 17 starts); Chicago's Scott Darling (.925 in 19 starts); Washington's Philipp Grubauer (.931 in 13 starts); New Jersey's Keith Kinkaid (.920 in 14 starts); and New York's Antti Raanta (.918 in 15 starts).\nBeyond that group are backups ascending into the No. 1 role either because of injury or poor performance. The Kings' Peter Budaj (more on him below), Senators' Mike Condon and Islanders' Thomas Greiss the best examples of that.\nThe Panthers pay a premium to carry both Reimer and Luongo, almost $8 million US on the cap, but it may just get them into the post-season while other teams come up short.\nStructure\nWhat has Guy Boucher brought to the Ottawa Senators in his first season behind the bench?\n\"Defensive structure is by far the biggest impact,\" Pierre Dorion, the team's general manager, said in a recent interview.\nA defensive disaster under Dave Cameron last year, Ottawa has indeed made substantive leaps this season under Boucher.\nGoals-against rank last season: 26th (2.94 per game) This season: 14th (2.68)\nShots against rank last season: 30th (32.8 per game) This season: 14th (30.1)\nThe penalty kill has made a big leap too, jumping from 29th at a lowly 75.8 per cent to 10th at 83.1 per cent.\nOttawa remains a poor puck possession team (23rd), but they've cut down the quality of chances against under Boucher while playing with what those around the team describe as improved \"structure.\"\n\"[Boucher] was definitely hired for that,\" Dorion said of defensive improvements. \"But he was also hired because he's a great hockey guy [and] he's a great communicator.\"\nKeeping L.A. afloat\nGoalie A: .918 save percentage/2.22 goals-against average/5 shutouts Goalie B: .920 save percentage/2.02 goals-against average/7 shutouts\nThe numbers for Goalie A belong to Jonathan Quick last season. The numbers for Goalie B? That would be Budaj this season who's been sensational for the Kings in Quick's absence. The 34-year-old posted three shutouts in a span of four starts recently, including back-to-back blankings of the Flyers and Avalanche.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Cats0ntheprowl/status/827685304643547136", "https://t.co/kDJmw8rzWp", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/TZKUdxqEW9M"], "published": "2017-02-06T22:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T04:15:17.677+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
