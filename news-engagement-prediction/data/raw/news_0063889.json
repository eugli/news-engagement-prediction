(Photo: Fox Restaurant Concepts) \n\"We bought two big rotisseries and we've been playing around with them, and one day we threw a prime rib on there and it was amazing, so we tried a bunch of other things,\" Fox told The Republic on Thursday.\nThis means that other meats and even rotisserie cauliflower will be joining the chickens alongside pizzas like pastrami with aged Gruyere and kale, or spiral ham with spicy pineapple and Thai basil.\nAs the menu pulls into focus, Fox’s culinary team also has unveiled some cocktails, starters and desserts.\nAlongside beer and wine, the bar will serve a signature gin and tonic with a touch of mint and Amaro Montenegro, while the “Afternoon Tea” combines peach and green mango tea with Aperol and clover honey.\nTo bracket the main event, diners can start with baked Buffalo chicken wings or truffle cheese stromboli and finish with warm butterscotch cream cake, or a parfait of peanut butter, chocolate, banana and bacon fittingly titled “The Elvis.”\nPatrons can dine while enjoying an exterior view through a wall of windows at Doughbird, at the southwest corner of Indian School Road and 44th Street, in Phoenix's Arcadia area.
