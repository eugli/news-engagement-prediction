The UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena debuted multiple new concession options in fall 2016 and now the venue is adding a Milwaukee name brand: Saz’s barbecue. Saz’s will open its spot in the arena’s northwest concourse Friday night as the Milwaukee Admirals play the Charlotte Checkers. Enlarge Saz's new concession stand is in the northwest concourse of the Panther Arena. This will be Saz’s first permanent concession stand in a building that’s not Saz's State House at 5539 W. State St. in Milwaukee, said owner Steve Sazama . Saz’s ran a barbecue stand from a cart at the Bradley Center for a few years and operates barbecue stands at Summerfest and Wisconsin State Fair. Sazama credited Admirals owner Harris Turer with luring Saz’s to the Panther Arena. “We’ve been Admirals supporters for years,” Sazama said. “Harris wanted to upgrade the food.” Although arena owner Wisconsin Center District and its concessionaire Levy Restaurants did refresh existing concession spaces with multiple new food options in fall 2016, Admirals officials noticed an underutilized stand in the arena’s northwest corner, Turer said. The Admirals agreed to share renovation costs with Saz’s, Turer said. “We are excited to expand our relationship with Saz’s and to offer our fans the signature items that has made them a staple of Milwaukee festivals for many years,” Turer said. Saz’s will offer beef brisket and barbecue pork sandwiches as well as a smoked honey turkey wrap. Side dishes will be cheese curds, mozzarella marinara sticks, sour cream and chive fries and a combo plate of all three sides. Levy runs a barbecue stand on the southeast side of the arena, but Sazama said his stand will not directly compete with Levy’s. Sazama said he’s not concerned about going into business at the arena as the UWM Panthers home season nears its end Feb. 26 and Milwaukee Wave soccer wraps up in early March. The Admirals regular season runs through mid-April with playoffs likely to follow. This weekend, Saz’s will feed Admirals fans Friday night, Panthers fans Saturday afternoon, Wave fans Saturday night and Admirals fans again on Sunday. The Tripoli Shrine Circus plays at the arena Feb. 23-26. “They’re really busy,” Sazama said of the arena. “We’re going to hit the ground running.” Senior Reporter Rich Kirchen covers health care, sports business, politics and media/advertising for the Milwaukee Business Journal.
