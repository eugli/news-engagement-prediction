The company currently has 2,636 Superchargers at 373 locations across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and plans to have twice as many locations open by the end of 2017.\nTesla’s Supercharging network allows owners of its Model S and Model X vehicles (as well as future Model 3 owners) to rapidly charge their vehicles while on long road trips, providing as much as 170 miles of range after just 30 minutes of charging.\n“We plan to accelerate expansion of the Supercharger network this year, starting with doubling our number of North American Supercharger locations in 2017,” the company said in its letter. Tesla shares a map showing current Supercharger stations (left) and those anticipated to be built in 2017 (right).\nGlobally, Tesla had 5,043 Supercharger connections across 790 locations as of December 31, 2016, a rise of around 10 percent from the year before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:04:58.476+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
