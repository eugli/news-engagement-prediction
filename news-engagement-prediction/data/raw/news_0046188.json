In the movie, Anna’s character finds herself sitting at an odd table of misfits at a wedding. In real life, Anna would never find herself in that situation — or at a wedding at all. When Seth asked her if she liked going to weddings, Anna said that she does everything she can to avoid them, adding, “It’s like watching your friends put on a little pageant.” She said, “I feel like I have potentially avoided making very close female friends, because I don’t want to be a bridesmaid.” \nIf that wasn’t enough, the Pitch Perfect star issued a threat to anyone even thinking about asking her to be a bridesmaid: “If you put me on an e-mail chain and tell me I have to wear Ballet Pink nail polish, I will kill you where you stand.” \nLate Night With Seth Meyers airs weeknights at 12:35 a.m. on NBC.  \nWatch: Anna Kendrick, Billy Eichner, and James Corden Sing the Soundtrack to Growing Up: \nTell us what you think!
