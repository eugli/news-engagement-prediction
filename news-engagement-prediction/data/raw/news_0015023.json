From 2010 they began to live separately, with Abbas marrying another woman. \nIn 2015, Rashidaben filed a suit for a deed of divorce to formalise the ‘triple talaq’ given by her husband. Abbas endorsed her claim that they were divorced by mutual consent, using the triple talaaq procedure under the Sharia law. \nThe family court, however, rejected the application saying the ‘triple talaaq’ had no legal validity, and she had not furnished a clear proof of divorce. \nRashidaben then moved the High Court, which in its order on January 25 set aside the family court’s order. \n“The petitioner lady is educated and is working as a teacher. The husband has already remarried after they separated. There is no dispute with regard to the fact that word ‘talaq’ has been thrice uttered,” the HC said, also noting that it had spoken to the couple to ascertain their wishes. \n“They both needed this decree for the purpose of preparation of official documents. In absence of any provision like section 13-B of Hindu Marriage Act when decree by mutual consent is permissible...they adopted this (course of action),” the HC observed. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T13:34:36.548+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
