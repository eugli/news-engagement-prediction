Then a big sinkhole began to form on the road,” an eyewitness told TASS. \n“Regional rescue services have already been deployed to the sinkhole collapse site. According to the preliminary information, the depth of the sinkhole amounts to 20 meters while its width is 15 meters,” says the report on the incident, published on the regional administration's website. \nThe incident is currently under investigation, Vladimir Miklushevsky, the governor of the Primorsky Krai region said. \nNo one was injured in the incident, according to administration and emergency services. \nCalculation errors may be among the reasons for the road collapse, the regional construction watchdog said .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T03:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T02:06:40.235+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
