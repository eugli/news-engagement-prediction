Named quite rightfully as Apple Park, the dreamy campus will take in more than 12,000 people over a period of six months (and more), and \"construction of the buildings and parklands is scheduled to continue through the summer,\" the company further announced. The campus will run entirely on renewable energy, it said. \nIn memory of late founder Steve Jobs, the theater at Apple Park will be named the Steve Jobs Theater. Situated atop a hill overlooking meadows and the main building, the Steve Jobs Theater is will open later this year and will have seating for 1,000 people. \n\"Steve's vision for Apple stretched far beyond his time with us. He intended Apple Park to be the home of innovation for generations to come,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. \"The workspaces and parklands are designed to inspire our team as well as benefit the environment. We've achieved one of the most energy-efficient buildings in the world and the campus will run entirely on renewable energy.\" \n\"Steve invested so much of his energy creating and supporting vital, creative environments. We have approached the design, engineering and making of our new campus with the same enthusiasm and design principles that characterise our products,\" said Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer. \nThe Apple Park is a \"haven of green space\" in the heart of the Santa Clara Valley. \"The campus' ring-shaped, 2.8 million-square-foot main building is clad entirely in the world's largest panels of curved glass,\" according to Apple. \nDesigned in collaboration with Foster + Partners, the Apple Park will run one of the largest on-site solar energy installations in the world, according to Apple. It is also said to not require any heating or air conditioning for nine months of the year.
