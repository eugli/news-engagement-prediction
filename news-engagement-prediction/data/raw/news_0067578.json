Man Utd via Getty Images \nArsenal should take a gamble and sign Wayne Rooney on a two-year contract. There’s no love lost between Jose Mourinho and Arsene Wenger but Petr Cech moved between the two managers and Wayne deserves the chance to choose his next move. \nIt is pretty clear his time at Manchester United is coming to an end. Jose is saying all the right things publicly but his team selections make it obvious he doesn’t fancy him and that’s his choice as manager. \nWayne isn’t going to be happy going into Carrington on a Monday morning with all the players who were involved in a win the weekend before, buzzing and flying about their performance while he’s sitting there not being a part of it. \nHe’s obviously a big player at the club but if you aren’t in the team, you are one step removed from all that and he won’t stand for it. \nWayne always wants to play and that’s what made him great. He was a street footballer with the same hunger and desire as a kid in the playground. \nIt’ll be killing him to sit around as part of a squad, even if he has broken Sir Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring record. (Man Utd via Getty Images) \nThere’s a lot of talk about Rooney going to China but I can’t see that happening, at least not before Tuesday’s transfer window deadline. \nEverything would have to be 100 per cent right and even though he has got Paul Stretford behind him – a very experienced guy and top football agent – it is a very long process to get a deal of that size over the line. Tianjin Quanjian boss confirms Rooney interest after failed Costa bid \nI suppose they could have been working on a deal for a while which would help but it makes more sense to keep his options open until the summer. And if Rooney is available then, the Gunners should come in for him. \nArsenal looked at him a few years ago so we know Arsene is a fan. He would improve that team overnight because they have an issue with attitude and he is a winner. \nI watched Arsenal the other night at Sutton and I know it was a difficult pitch but some of their younger players were getting caught in possession, losing it cheaply and were putting their team in danger.
