According to me, coming to this conference [the ANC elective congress in December this year], it was going to be easy if comrade Kgalema was there, we were going to proceed,” said Mabuza. \nThe Mpumalanga strongman also pointed his guns at Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, saying Ramaphosa was also out order after he publicly declared his availability to be elected as Zuma’s successor. \nMabuza said it was not up to Ramaphosa to decide which position he should be elected to, arguing that only ANC branches could decide who to put in leadership positions. \n“Don’t tell us, ‘No, I’ve got this ambition’. It’s not about your ambition, it’s about how we feel as an organisation whether you’re going to be helpful to us,” said Mabuza. \nMotlanthe and Ramaphosa, through their spokespeople, declined to comment on what Mabuza said. \nMabuza is one of the frontrunners in the ANC’s leadership race. \nMpumalanga has stated that it is time for him to be elected to a prominent national leadership position after he served three terms as its provincial chairman and two as premier. \nRead the full article on Sunday Times Share Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
