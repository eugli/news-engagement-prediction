All services from London Euston were suspended due to Storm Doris, with a failure of electricity between Crewe and Warrington Bank Quay causing chaos on Virgin Trains - and several other lines suffering major disruption. Chaotic scenes were witnessed on motorways - including the M80 in Scotland, which was closed in both directions due to the snow - and forecasters warned black ice could cause further problems for drivers tonight. A crosswind or 'crab' landing sees an aircraft drifting laterally as it approaches the runway in order to track the runway centerline, thereby enabling the pilot to safely bring the plane to the ground. The KLM jet comes to a halt amid a huge cloud of spray Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Steven Draper, representative of the British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) and a former pilot, said of the crab landing method: 'Landing in strong crosswinds or turbulence goes beyond the capabilities of the aeroplane's automatic pilot. 'A pilot should be alert and free from fatigue when landing, and be given the opportunity to develop excellent handling skills.' Speaking to MailOnline previously, Dai Whittingham, the chief executive of the UK Flight Safety Committee, stated that while crosswinds appear dangerous, they are an everyday occurrence. He said: 'High winds in themselves are not dangerous but they can certainly be inconvenient, especially if the wind direction is across the runway. 'All pilots train to land in high crosswind conditions and will have practiced to the aircraft limits in the simulator. 'When any new aircraft is certified to carry passengers it comes with a published crosswind limit which is the maximum that has been demonstrated by a test pilot during the certification process. 'If the wind is outside that limit the crew will have to take the aircraft to an alternate airport where the wind is within limits (which means a runway that has less of a crosswind component). 'In practice, the wind is rarely aligned fully with the runway so there is always a slight crosswind to deal with, it is just the amount of it that varies.' Whittingham also noted that the public misconceptions about landing in strong winds is probably down to turbulence as the approaches are always bumpy. Additionally, passengers do not have the same forward view as the pilot, which makes the sensation of being buffeted in all directions all the more uncomfortable. He concluded by saying: 'There is a briefing given before all approaches to ensure that both pilots understand the type of approach, what the division of duties are, and any special considerations. 'A strong crosswind (or strong winds in general) would certainly be a briefing topic. 'Both pilots will be monitoring the situation to ensure the wind does not exceed their limits and both will be alert to the possibility that the landing may need to be abandoned. 'The pilots would also remind themselves of the correct techniques and decide on the additional safety factor to be applied to the target approach speed.' HOW SITTING IN THE FLIGHT DECK CURED ONE MAN'S TURBULENCE FEAR An airline captain reveals how he cured one passenger's fear of flying by inviting him into the cockpit, pre-9/11, during turbulence. 'So, some years ago now, I did a flight back from Bucharest, and it was just one of those days when it was going to be bumpy the whole way. And we got about an hour into it and the purser came up to me and said \"I know there's probably nothing you can do about it, but there's a gentleman sat in business and he's asked me to ask you to please make it stop, because he can't take it any more\". 'And I said we've tried different levels, we've tried going up, we've tried going down, it's just one of those days it's going to be like that. And this was pre-9/11, so we could get people in and out of the flight deck and I actually went back and saw him. And he was a really charming guy, but obviously absolutely terrified. Every time the aircraft bucked and weaved he tensed. 'So I said \"why don't you come in? Come and sit with us. If you're going to be scared, you might as well be scared with us, rather than sat here on your own\". 'And he told me this story... he was a business guy who had a furniture business. He built furniture in Bucharest, so once a month, he had to go to Bucharest. And for the week before, he'd be terrified, and for the week he was in Bucharest he knew he had to come back and then he'd live two weeks of normal life. And then he'd go back to another week of being terrified. It was just awful. 'So anyway, we kept him in. He was asking if it would fall, and we'd say \"no\". I took the autopilot out and said: \"Look, it'll fly itself. It's just going to sit here. This is where it wants to be. It's at 35,000 feet doing mach 0.76. This is what a 737 wants to do. We're not flying it. It's just here. It's a happy aeroplane.\" 'We kept him in for the approach and landing to Gatwick and showed him all the protocols, how we slow down, what we do, how we keep it safe, what we're looking at and so on. 'We got on the ground and he was nearly hysterical with happiness and I thought he was going to cry. He said: \"You've have changed the way that I feel about this and I'm going to be better now.\" 'This was going back about 15 years and I still remember his face and I still remember that flight, the whole hour and a half we had with him in the flight deck and how buzzed he was afterwards. It had set his phobia free. 'And that's one of the real shames about why we can't have people in the flight deck anymore. For very good reason. It's a shame because it makes such a difference to people. 'It's a bit like aversion therapy. Sometimes you need to have it pushed harder to cure it.'
