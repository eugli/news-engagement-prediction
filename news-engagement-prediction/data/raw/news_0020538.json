(Photo: Liz Biro/IndyStar) Buy Photo \nA string of heartbreaking Indianapolis restaurant closings over the past year gets a little longer today with the news that Pizzology on Mass Ave. will end its run. \nOwner Neal Brown confirmed on Facebook this afternoon that the pizzeria, 608 Massachusetts Ave., will close on Feb. 19, but Brown is not leaving the neighborhood. In the same space, he'll debut Stella, a restaurant serving southern European food, mainly from Italy, France and Spain, on March 21. \nBrown has not responded to calls for more information but said this afternoon on Facebook, “We're excited to bring some new vibes to our Mass Ave spot.” \nThe Indy chef has also stepped up to take over the SoBro space that hosts Recess, due to close Feb. 18 after nearly seven years in business. Japanese restaurant Ukiyo , which Brown had planned to put in Fountain Square this year, will instead occupy the Recess site, 4907 N. College Ave. \nRecess chef/owner Greg Hardesty announced last week that he was ready to abandon the physical and mental demands of the restaurant business. \nExcitement surrounded Pizzology's opening on Mass in spring 2014. The original location in Carmel,13190 Hazel Dell Pkwy., was already popular thanks to Brown's signature pies, devotion to locally sourced ingredients and from-scratch cooking. By that time, Brown was well-known in Indy, having run the acclaimed restaurant L’Explorateur (2006-2009) and had twice been a James Beard Award semifinalist. He also co-founded Dig IN , an organization that promotes Indiana food and stages a huge local food festival each summer. \nWith two Pizzology locations operating, Brown in late 2014 opened a third unit in Carmel's Village of WestClay. It closed a year later. \nBrown is the second owner of late to close and rebrand a restaurant. Plow & Anchor owners said parking problems forced them in January to shutter that restaurant and devise a new concept to launch in March. They have not said what the change will bring. \nBrown is facing more competition on the corridor. Goodfellas Pizzeria , promising New York-style pizza and 300-plus bourbons, opens soon in 3,750 square feet next door to Salt on Mass seafood restaurant in the Millikan on Mass building. Bazbeaux pizzeria is also on the avenue. \nOther longtime restaurants that have closed since the start of 2016 include R. Bistro on Mass Ave., Milano Inn at Fletcher Place, DuFour's in Irvington, Barking Dog Cafe in Meridian-Kessler, Gaslight Inn on the Southside, City Cafe Downtown and Funkyard Coffee Shop & Art Gallery in Fountain Square. \nNew restaurants have moved into almost all of those locations. R. Bistro became Rooster's Kitchen . DuFour's hosts Lincoln Square Pancake House . Patachou Inc. restaurant group will open Crispy Bird fried chicken restaurant at the former Barking Dog Cafe. Mile Square Bistro has moved into City Cafe. Litterally Divine chocolate shop took over Funkyard Coffee Shop. Gaslight Inn still offers catering services. \nFollow IndyStar food writer Liz Biro on Twitter: @lizbiro , Instagram: @lizbiro , Facebook and Pinterest .
