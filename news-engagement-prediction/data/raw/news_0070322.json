The new wireless charger will have a Qi base with model number EP-PG950 and the source says that it will charge at 15W as well as the standard 10W charge. Samsung Galaxy S8 : faster wirless charging with new Qi base EP-PG950 – 15W (9V /1.67A – charge wireless), 10W (5V / 2A – standard charge) \n— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) February 23, 2017 \nThis is great news for those us who prefer to charge our devices without plugging them in. Personally, I’m not a fan of wireless charging, but that’s because I live with cats and kids that have other ideas about me setting my phone precariously on a wireless pad that’s only a few inches across. Do you use wireless charging? Prefer it? Does a phone not supporting wireless charging influence your decision when you buy a phone? \nLet us know in the comments.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:12:02.933+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
