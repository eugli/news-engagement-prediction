It launches in stores nationwide from Thursday.\nThe invention arrives just days after the UK’s Wine and Spirit Trade Association warned of a dramatic price hike in the wake of Brexit on the number one tipple.\nIt said prosecco prices could rise by 9% - or an average of 59p per bottle in the coming months, due to growing demand and rising costs from suppliers.\nRead More From prosecco to Peugeots: The huge price rises we’ve already seen, and the big rises still on the way\nThe sparkling wine sector is currently worth over £604.4 million in the UK - and Asda has seen sales rise by 33% over the past two years.\nAsda says customers won't be disappointed (Photo: Getty)\nAsda's wine buyer Jack Clayton said: \"Progrigio is a new Italian sparkling wine aimed at the prosecco and pinot grigio customer to try something familiar but just a little different. It is a fresh, floral and aromatic wine balanced by citrus fruits, white peaches and minerality.\n\"If you love prosecco, you’ll love Progrigio,\" he added.\npoll loading Will you be trying Asda's 'Progrigio'? 0+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO\nEd Betts, Asda wine buying manager comments: \"We always strive to keep prices as low as possible without compromising on quality and we believe Progrigio is the ideal affordable sparkling wine alternative.”\n\"We want to protect the demand for sparkling wine by offering customers more choice, and by moving slightly away from the prosecco region we have discovered a great example of quality fizz at an everyday price.\"\nRead More Cut your supermarket bill Buy the same food for £400 less How I feed my family for £25 a week Beat supermarket price tricks Top supermarket deals online How I cut my food bill in half The best-value supermarket wine Six of the best ways to find coupons How supermarkets use maths against us Asda Alcohol Supermarkets Save money", "external_links": ["https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorMoney", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrormoneysaving"], "published": "2017-02-16T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T20:13:02.839+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
