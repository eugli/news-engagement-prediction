Man admits owning 9,000 of the sickest child abuse images police had ever seen \nOne of the group even plugged a phone into the plane’s control panel. \nA flight attendant on the trip described the journey as the ‘worst in 11 years’ of working as cabin crew. \nAccording to witnesses on board, the group stood in the aisles and refused to move from their position until crew found them seats that were not next to women. Police were called to the airport (Picture: Getty) \nAs well as the aisle incident, others constantly rang the service button. \nSpeaking to the Jewish Chronicle , one passenger said: ‘A group of around 10 ultra-Orthodox men caused absolute bedlam on the flight. \n‘At one point there were about 10 men in black hats blocking the aisles and refusing to sit down. It was impossible for the stewards to get these people to listen to them. Church of England votes to reject anti-gay marriage report \n‘When some of the women got up and moved seats to ensure that the plane got to take off, some of these men never even thought about saying “thank you”. Then after the plane took off one male plugged his phone into the control panel above the stewards’ area.’ \nOfficers from Bedfordshire Police were waiting on the tarmac when the plane landed in Luton on Monday. A spokesperson for easyJet said: ‘easyJet can confirm that flight EZY2084 from Tel Aviv to Luton on 13 February 2017 was met by police on arrival at London Luton. ‘This was due to a small group of passengers behaving disruptively, by not complying with the captain and cabin crew’s request to take their seats, both prior to departure from Tel Aviv and during the flight. ‘For the safety of all passengers easyJet’s crew must ensure that whenever the seat belt signs are illuminated all passengers are in their seats with their seatbelts fastened. BBC just announced Father Christmas isn’t real during a live broadcast ‘easyJet’s cabin crew are trained to assess and evaluate all situations and to act quickly and appropriately to ensure that the safety of the flight and other passengers is not compromised at any time. ‘Separately during the flight a passenger plugged a mobile device into a USB port on the crew control panel in the forward galley in a foolish attempt to charge it. ‘This led to the exit light above the panel being illuminated but did not in any way comprise the safety or security of the aircraft.’ In a statement, Bedfordshire Police said: ‘We were called at around 5.55pm on Monday to reports of a group of disruptive men on a flight landing at London Luton Airport. ‘Officers attended and escorted the men off the flight preventing a breach of the peace. No offences were found to have been committed.’ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T16:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:36:11.397+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
