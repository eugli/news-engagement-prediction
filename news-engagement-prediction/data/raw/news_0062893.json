Bowman, too, escaped with a caution from referee Don Robertson for the challenge. \nRodgers cited John Kennedy, now Celtic first-team coach, whose time as a player with the club was truncated after he was the victim, on his Scotland debut against Romania in March 2004, of a horrific tackle by Ionel Ganea, then of Wolves. Kennedy’s shattered knee kept him out of the game for three years and eventually forced his premature retirement . \n“I have young players but I ask them to be men in the game and I think we have shown over the course of the season we can handle a tough, aggressive, tight game of football,” said Rodgers. “We can take that but I need the officials to control it - if something is a bad tackle, they have got to see it. \n“John Kennedy lost his career on the back of an absolutely disgraceful challenge and that could easily have happened to Kieran Tierney last week. It is the responsibility of officials to protect players - not just the referee, but all four of them. Kieran Tierney was on the receiving end of a bad tackle Credit: rex \n“It was the same with Scott Sinclair the other week. They are awful challenges. \n“We play an aggressive game and we have lots of games like that that are great – away at Aberdeen, for example - tough games where you fight and tackle, but when it goes over the top we need the help of the referees otherwise you are going to lose talented players and you may lose careers because of it.” \nA sked if he felt whether Celtic – runaway league leaders in the Scottish Premiership – were being targeted by frustrated opponents, Rodgers said: “I don’t know what it is. I know a player like Sinclair is quick and dynamic and that can affect timing, but a bad challenge is a bad challenge. I don’t care who it is. \n“I’m not saying to go soft. In Scotland and in England we see two teams competing and fighting for the result, but we have seen some naughty challenges. I’m talking primarily about my players but if it’s happening elsewhere then it’s an issue. \n“The last thing I want to be sitting here talking about is a serious injury to Kieran Tierney. If his foot was planted last week, with a straight leg coming in on a 19-year-old, I’m frightened to think what could have happened to him.” Brendan Rodgers enjoyed the Edinburgh derby as a spectator Credit: getty images \nM eanwhile, having experienced three Old Firm derbies as a winner, Rodgers savoured his first exposure to the Edinburgh equivalent as a spectator at the Scottish Cup fifth-round replay when Neil Lennon’s Hibs beat Hearts 3-1 in a compelling contest before a capacity crowd at Easter Road. \n“The occasion was great. I was interested to go and see the game because we could get one of the teams as opponents,” said Rodgers. “I wanted to ensure I’d seen Hibs close up to get a feel for them, in case we meet them at some point. \n“I also wanted to take in the occasion, which was wonderful. Down south people may not be as appreciative of it but it’s a game up here you can be very proud of - there was real passion in the game with good intensity. I thoroughly enjoyed it. \n“It was a shame it wasn’t televised. I didn’t see the first game between them although by all accounts it wasn’t the greatest, but this one was. There were quality goals and good chances created in a brilliant atmosphere. I think if it was on TV it would have been a nice advert for Scottish football.” \nOne player who caught Rodgers’ eye was the Hibs midfielder, John McGinn, grandson of former Celtic chairman and SFA President, Jack McGinn. “He looks like the type of player you love as a manager,” Rodgers said. \n“Defensively he’s strong, he doesn’t oversell himself, he’s technically very good when he tackles. \n“Tactically he looks like he’s got a good understanding of the game. He passes it well and he was a real driving force for them in there, so it’s great to see an honest boy like that, doing well.” Follow Telegraph Football", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:02:06.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
