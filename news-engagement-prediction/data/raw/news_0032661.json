GOLNEZ BASSAM TASBAR \nThe scarring the day of the procedure. \n\"It feels like I've put my face in acid... it looks hideous,\" Bassam Tabar, 35, said. \nREAD MORE: \nBassam Tabar said she was familiar with beauty treatments and paid for an arm and facial waxing at iCandy Nail and Waxing salon on Friday. GOLNEZ BASSAM TASBAR \nThe burn below her right eye. \nA small amount of warm or hot wax it applied to an area around the mouth or side of the face before it is ripped off. \n\"It was an average amount of pain, there was nothing out of the blue,\" she said. \nBut it wasn't until her work colleagues noticed \"very red and very raw\" looking blotches appear on her face that she knew the procedure wasn't done right. \n\"It was already feeling sensitive but my colleagues said it looked terrible.\" Ad Feedback \nBassam Tabar went back to the salon and asked for a refund, but she said the store simply refused. \nWhen she asked for aftercare treatment, she was given a squirt of aloe vera gell in a eyelash container. \n\"I was horrified. My face felt like it had this burning sensation all over... they weren't even shocked, it was just appalling.\" \nBassam Tabar posted on the salon's Facebook page pictures of her burned face. It was there she discovered a slew of complaints from other customers. \n\"Whatever you do, do not use the waxing services at this salon,\" one review read. \nAnother comment read \"ENTER IF YOU DARE\". \nShe said the store then offered her a refund if she took her post down, an offer which she had accepted. \nBut the scarring procedure forced Bassam Tabar to seek LED red light healing treatment from a skin clinic the next day. \nBassam Tabar said she was considering taking legal action over the damage done to her face. \n\"You're not supposed to walk out of a beauty clinic with skin ripped off. \n\"I would expect a certain standard of service and care from a salon in Ponsonby.\" \nAn iCandy staff member who identified herself as the manager refused to comment when approached. \"Stop talking,\" she said, and hung up the phone. \nThe salon posted on Facebook to say it no longer offered facial waxing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:07:56.830+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
