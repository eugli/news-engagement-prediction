The Gunners and European football have for some reason not been a match made in Heaven down the years, and it looks like there could be more heartbreak this time as well. \nBut since today is the day of romance, we’re getting a bit misty-eyed about those rare nights in Europe when Arsenal have really shown what they’re made of with some breathtaking victories against the very best sides on the continent. Barcelona stars in stitches after Neymar turns up to training with new look \nIt does happen occasionally, and maybe they’re overdue one after six seasons in a row of getting dumped out at this stage of the competition. Even if just due to the sheer law of averages, Arsenal must have some small hope, right? \nNo one gave them much of a chance in these five games either, so here’s a look back at some Champions League classics for Arsenal fans to give them some belief that they can fall back in love with their team all over again… Inter Milan 1-5 Arsenal (2003) Thierry Henry was on fire in a 5-1 Arsenal win at Inter Milan (Picture: Getty) \nWhat a night for Arsenal. In need of a victory to keep any hope of qualifying from their group alive, the Gunners faced the daunting task of a trip to Inter Milan, who’d beaten them 3-0 at Highbury just weeks earlier. \nStill, seeming to thrive most when written off, the Gunners produced one of their greatest Champions League performances to thrash the Italian giants 5-1. \nThierry Henry (who else?) struck two fine goals, while Freddie Ljungberg, Edu and Robert Pires helped themselves to the three others. \nIt should’ve been the start of something bigger for that group of players in this tournament, but it wasn’t, as despite their fine Premier League form in that Invincibles year, they under-achieved in Europe with a defeat to Chelsea in the quarter-finals.
