With the new Bite Beauty Prismatic Pearl Crème Lip Gloss collection, it might be striking gold twice. (Pun intended.) First of all, the new lip glosses are holographic . Second of all, they were inspired by black pearls from Tahiti, so by extension, the new Prismatic Pearl Crème Lip Glosses are basically inspired by mermaids . When you look at the six new shades of gloss, you can definitely sense the under-the-sea influences. Each is more metallic, chromatic, and iridescent than the next. They are almost like the gloss version of the Urban Decay Liquid Moondust shadows. Like Too Faced's Unicorn Tears lipstick , these Bite Beauty products shift colors when swiped onto lips. Peacock, for example, looks deep teal in the tube. However, when the light hits it, the gloss turns black, purple, brown, or burgundy. After I applied it for the first time, I couldn't stop moving my head around to see new shades. (To the people around me, I probably looked like I was stretching out a kink in my neck—oops.) Oyster Pearl, my favorite shade of the bunch, has a similar finish. It looks like someone put every color glitter imaginable into a clear lip gloss. It simultaneously looks petal pink, baby blue, lilac, and taupe. The closest description I can get to is a metallic mauve. There's also Champagne Pearl (a champagne-meets-gold), Pink Pearl (a pink with a gold and peach shift), Rose Pearl (a rose with green and violet shimmer), and Bronze Pearl (a bronze with silver and gold shift). (So many pearls, so little time.) You May Also Like ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:58:03.710+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
