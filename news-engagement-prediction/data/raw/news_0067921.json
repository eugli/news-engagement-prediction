Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA neo-Nazi extremist who idolised Adolf Hitler as his \"God\" has been jailed for five years under terror laws after he posted racist rants on social media. \nSean Creighton, 45, of Enfield, north London, made a vile stream of Islamophobic, homophobic and anti-Semitic calls to arms and kept a \"white resistance\" manual that could be used by terrorists. \nIn one example, he posted an image of Adolf Hitler with the message \"kill the Muslims\" while another included a picture of a gun alongside a Swastika with the words \"Jews prepare to die\". \nCreighton was snared by Met Police counter terrorism detectives after a picture emerged of a man armed with an assault rifle standing in front of a Nazi flag. Sean Creighton posed with a knife in front of the Union Jack (Photo: CENTRAL NEWS) \nPhotographs also showed Nazi tattoos inked on his chest and him armed with a knife in front of the Union Jack.

He was jailed for five years after he admitted public order and a terrorism offence (Photo: CENTRAL NEWS) \nHe also admitted six counts of publishing or distributing materials that were likely to stir up racial hatred and a further count of possession of racially inflammatory materials. \nThe court was told that Creighton's actions showed links to and support for various groups such as neo-Nazi organisation Combat 18, National Action and Aryan Strikeforce. \nHe also posted images designed to stir hatred of sexual orientation and \"threatening\" pictures of a man brandishing a rifle in front of a black child. \nThe court heard Creighton considered his material, posted to his 692 followers, was \"harmless\" because he was contacting those with similar views. \nOn Thursday he was jailed for five years. \nSue Hemming, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: \"Sean Creighton's crimes are indicative of a man who thought that his online anonymity meant that he could get away with stirring up hatred of all kinds. \n\"Those who seek to stir up hatred between communities, particularly where that hatred is combined with dangerous terrorist ideologies, should understand they will be prosecuted.\" \nCommander Dean Haydon, of the Counter Terrorism Command, said: \"We are as committed to apprehending and prosecuting far-right extremists who commit terrorist offences and promote hatred as we are those who support and promote Isis. \n\"Both are intent on destroying communities and pose a real risk if they are allowed to continue.\" Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T19:44:10.906+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
