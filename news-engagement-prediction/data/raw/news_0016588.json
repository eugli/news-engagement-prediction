Terrell Owens (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:33 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:33 p.m. ET \nTerrell Owens broke the surprising news early Saturday night. \nHe was not elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his second year of eligibility. Unfortunately I DID NOT MAKE IT again this year. Thanks to ALL my fans & supporters. #FlawedProcess — Terrell Owens (@terrellowens) February 4, 2017 HOF is a total joke. Honestly, doesn't mean anything to me to get in beyond this point. https://t.co/wJJ8vVSp9d \nMORE: Breaking down T.O.'s competition for Hall of Fame Class of '17, including one old rival \nFor all the talk about this year's new inductees, there seemed to be more buzz and puzzlement over Owens' snub. He's certainly got the numbers, standing second in all-time receiving yards, third in receiving touchdowns … if he's not a Hall of Fame receiver, many fans wondered, who, besides Jerry Rice, fits the bill? \nOwens is second all-time in receiving yards with 15,934, third in receiving touchdowns with 153, and eighth with 1,078 receptions. \nOwens wasn't the only one on social media wondering how he fell short, including many sportswriters. Pretty ridiculous. 2nd all time in receiving yards behind GOAT Jerry Rice and he can't get in the hall? Cmon. https://t.co/RtDxztBs1s — Frank Schwab (@YahooSchwab) February 5, 2017 If only Terrell Owens brought his lunch pail to work every day...had a good motor...was a coach on the field... — mike freeman (@mikefreemanNFL) February 5, 2017 \nOwens' snub even sparked spats between sportswriters on Twitter. I have friends on Hall of Fame selection committee, but anyone who didn't vote for @TerrellOwens is clueless & should lose voting privileges — Manish Mehta (@MMehtaNYDN) February 5, 2017 Read This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T03:49:26.266+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
