Mr. Falwell told The Chronicle on Tuesday that President Trump had asked him to lead such a panel, which would be charged with curbing federal overreach in higher ed. \nMr. Falwell has enjoyed a rapid rise in prominence over the past few years, and especially since November's presidential election. Here are three things you should know about him: \n1. He sits at the head of a sprawling Christian university with an enormous online presence. \nLiberty University today is something of a juggernaut. \nStarted by Mr. Falwell's father, the religious broadcaster Jerry Falwell, in 1971, Liberty has ballooned in size over the decades. As of 2015, the university's online program had more than 65,000 students. That expansion has come on the back of a particularly aggressive marketing strategy. \nThings weren't always so prosperous for the university. The institution teetered on the brink of financial collapse throughout its early days. And the popular view of Liberty has often focused on its strict code of conduct (students cannot engage in \"sexual relations outside of a biblically ordained marriage between a natural-born man and a natural-born woman,\" among other things). Read more about the code of conduct, which was updated in 2015. \nFor more, read this 2015 Chronicle profile of the institution. \n2. He favors guns on campuses. \nMr. Falwell, a gun enthusiast himself, thinks people should be able to carry concealed firearms on campuses.
