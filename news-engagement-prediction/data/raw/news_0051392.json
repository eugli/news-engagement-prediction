Ahead of the upcoming release of anticipated video game sequel Injustice 2 , longtime gamer Kohli will cover the gaming front, sitting down for interviews and debuting new exclusive previews of upcoming DC games, while Moore will take over from Tiffany Smith to co-host DC All Access alongside Jason Inman. \nSmith isn't leaving the team, however; she's simply shifting focus, and will be taking on new assignments as the new film and television correspondent, offering up news, interviews and sneak peaks of upcoming programs and movies based on DC properties. Additionally, Hector Navarro will continue in his weekly role covering DC's upcoming TV shows each Monday. \nIn a statement accompanying the news, DC Entertainment Director of Digital Marketing Paul Malmont said that DC All Access — which launched in 2013 as a weekly web series, before launching a regularly updated standalone app last year — has \"solidified its position as the one-stop source for the latest news hitting the DC Universe. By adding Rahul and Whitney to the series and expanding Tiffany’s role in covering TV and film, the show is becoming bigger and better than ever before.” \nDC's online offerings will expand even further with the addition of DC Kids , a new series from All Access producers Telepictures Productions Inc.; aimed at an all-ages audiences, the new series will be hosted by \"two kid super-fans,\" Jett and Analei, and will focus on \"unboxings and demos of the latest, must-have action figures and toys, do-it-yourself crafts, recipes and activities, game-style show competitions and so much more,\" according to DC. The new strand of programming launches March 3. \n\"“From DC Super Hero Girls to Teen Titans Go! , there is a massive fan base of young viewers looking for the latest news, products and content about these iconic characters,\" says Scott Gordon, Director, Digital Marketing, Warner Bros. Consumer Products. \"We’re excited to partner with DC to launch DC Kids as a new way to directly reach these passionate fans, and create a space that is specifically geared to a young audience.\" \nDC All Access is available here .
