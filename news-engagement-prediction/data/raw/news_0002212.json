Some went to a nearby mosque, others got creative. \n“We’ve been having to pray in hallways or stairwells or wherever we could find.” Advocates have been pushing the UofA for a larger space to pray for a decade. Say students were praying in stairwells, hallways, libraries. pic.twitter.com/ZgRHh7W4CW \n— Sarah Kraus Global (@SarahNKraus) February 4, 2017 \nThe multi-faith prayer space is open to people of all denominations, including those who don’t practice religion at all, but who might seek out a safe and welcoming area. \n“There would be people who would come and just sit, or even people that would come and actually do yoga,” Iqbal explained. \nLast week, Lutheran Chaplain Richard Reimer saw the space being used just as intended. \n“The Muslims were saying their prayers here, across was a group doing yoga in the multi-purpose room and in a small meeting room was a Christian-faith discussion group,” he said. “It was all going on at the same time. The beauty of this space is people meet one another, as you can see, in the hallways. So it encourages interaction, and hopefully one day collaboration.” \nHe said in the 25 years he’s worked at the university, prayer space has always been in high demand. That’s been especially true lately, with more Muslim students coming to the school and praying multiple times daily. While these Muslim students were using the space this evening, it's open to students of any background or religion. pic.twitter.com/2pGn7LmSbb \n— Sarah Kraus Global (@SarahNKraus) February 4, 2017 \n“There’s also a need for prayer space for people of other faiths, people who’ve been meeting in broom closets here, or a classroom there.” \nReimer said the space is designed to help people get to know one another. \n“If somebody is from a small town in Alberta and they’ve never met a Muslim, and they come to Christian prayer, they’re going to meet a Muslim and maybe they’ll get into a conversation.” \nThe multi-faith prayer and meditation space also features Wudu facilities for Muslims to cleanse themselves before praying. \n“I think it’s great because it shows that the university does acknowledge that the Muslim student population is growing,” second-year student Naiha Wasi said. \nShe also appreciates the larger space.

That’s why we have designated prayer times that you can come and pray together, so it is a community feeling.” \nIt’s something the Muslim Students’ Association appreciates. \n“We’re very fortunate that the university has constructed such a beautiful space that will not only serve the students of today but also of tomorrow as well,” Iqbal said. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T13:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T09:49:21.770+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
