(NurPhoto/Getty Images) \nAndrea Belotti scored twice in front of a watching Arsenal scout to rescue a 2-2 draw for Torino against Fiorentina on Monday evening. \nRiccardo Saponara and Nikola Kalinic had given Fiorentina a two-goal lead by half-time, but Belotti’s double secured an unlikely point for Torino. \nBelotti’s first came from four yards out as he headed in a hooked cross from Emiliano Moretti, while the Italian’s equaliser in the 85th minute highlighted his strong positional awareness and coolness from close range. \nFrom just inside the area, Daniele Baselli curled in a cross towards the back post and Belotti neatly met the pass with a first-time finish low past Fiorentina goalkeeper Ciprian Tatarusanu. \nBelotti also missed a penalty when Torino were 2-0 down as his effort clipped the crossbar before going over. Belotti hit the bar with his penalty in the second half. (Getty Images) Belotti’s two goals both came from close range. (Getty Images) Belotti has 19 goals in 23 Serie A games this season. (Getty Images) \nReports in Italy claimed before the match that Arsenal had sent a scout to watch the 23-year-old striker during the match. \nBelotti, who has a €100 million (£86m) release clause, has also been linked with a move to Chelsea.
