The California Department of Water Resources said Sunday that the water level continues to fall even as they decrease the amount of water flowing down the spillway. The amount of water flowing down the spillway was increased from 55,000 cubic feet a second (cfs) to 60,000 cfs Sunday afternoon in anticipation of the storm. Earlier this week, outflows were at nearly 100,000 cfs.
