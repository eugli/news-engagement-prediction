'Screams and sobs' \nMrs Mills wrote that telling her children was \"the hardest thing I have ever had to do. \n\"The screams of one, and the quiet sobs of the other will stay with me for the rest of my life.\" \n\"Their idyllic childhood was brought to an abrupt end by a person who should not have been driving that night.\" \nThe defence lawyer said MacSherry had been a \"chronic alcohol addict\" for two years and had suffered from the breakdown of her marriage in the days before the crash. \nAt the time of the accident she was wearing her pyjamas, dressing gown and slippers and had no recollection of what happened.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T00:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T05:06:06.349+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
