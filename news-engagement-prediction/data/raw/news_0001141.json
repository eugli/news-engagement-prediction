Don't hit the gym Rhys Buccat, ABS-CBN News Posted at Feb 02 2017 12:47 AM | Updated as of Feb 02 2017 08:54 AM \nShare Facebook \nMANILA â€” If a man wants to win Liza Soberano's heart, here's one piece of advice: do not hit the gym. \nIn the media launch of \"My Ex and Whys\" on Wednesday night, starring Soberano and Enrique Gil, the young actress was asked if she's comfortable seeing Gil without a shirt on. \nThis, after one of the movie's teasers shows Soberano and a topless Gil trapped inside a dark room. \n\"Sa totoo lang po feeling ko sobrang comfortable na ako kay Quen (Gil) kaya hindi ako naiilang. Tsaka sa totoo lang, ayoko ng lalaking sobrang ma-abs,\" she said. \nSoberano even recalled how she felt nervous while doing a scene with a shirtless Joseph Marco in the now-defunct series \"Dolce Amore.\" \n\"Kahit noong 'Dolce Amore' may scene po kami ni Joseph Marco na naghuhubad siya sa harap ko, hindi ko talaga siya matignan. Hindi dahil kinikilig ako or something . . . parang . . . I don't know. I have a phobia of seeing naked men,\" she said. \nBut according to Soberano, the awkwardness seems to disappear when she's doing a scene with Gil, her long-time leading man. \n\"Parang wala pong malisya 'pag si Quen. Parang katawan ng baby,\" she said, causing a hushed reaction from the press and Lizquen fans who attended the launch. \n\"Hindi niya kasi kailangan ng abs para, you know . . .\" she immediately added. \n\"My Ex and Whys\" will hit cinemas on February 15. \nShare", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T03:37:57.444+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
