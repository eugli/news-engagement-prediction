'Just imagine, just imagine, just imagine.' (Photo: Kevin Winter, Getty Images) \nThere's no question that Justin Timberlake is having the best time at the Oscars – except, perhaps, for the unsuspecting couple from the tour bus who was \"married\" by Denzel Washington. \nThe former boy bander's night of fun started out on the red carpet. \n'Behold my pose,' Timberlake probably. (Photo: Christopher Polk, Getty Images) \nHe photobombed his wife, Jessica Biel. \nJessica, don't look now. (Photo: Dan MacMedan-USA TODAY NETWORK) \nThat sneaky triple threat also hilariously photobombed Emma Stone during an interview. \nAnd, though it wasn't an *NSYNC reunion, Timberlake seemed to enjoy opening the show with his Oscar-nominated track Can't Stop the Feeling from the movie Trolls . \nAfter greeting his All New Mickey Mouse Club co-star, Ryan Gosling, Timberlake looked overjoyed busting out some moves. \nBros. (Photo: Kevin Winter, Getty Images) \nHe also broke into Lovely Day and headed into the audience to shake it with Halle Berry and best dressed Biel. \nSeriously, if you're thinking anyone else is having a better time than J. Timberlake, it's time to re-examine. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
