Burns School of Medicine, the University of Hawaii's Manoa campus and Downtown Honolulu. The company, which has 21 employees, was formerly located in the Hawaii Research Center Building in Aiea. Parks also said the space gives the laboratory access to emergency power, something that wasn’t readily available in their old location. “We always had power outages. And when it goes down, you have to stuff dry ice in all of this,” he said, opening up a minus-70 freezer during a tour of the facility. “Another advantage is the fact that this is brand new — we were able to design it from scratch,” he added. “We have a lot more of economy of scale. I’d say it’s the same size, but it’s much more efficient than the chopped up space that we used to have.” The facility includes a medicinal chemistry laboratory and a molecular biology laboratory as well as administrative offices. “Infectious things aren’t done here, which makes a lot of people happy, including the land lord and all the tenants,” Parks added. Hawaii Gov. David Ige and Rep. Colleen Hanabusa were present at the ceremony, with each giving remarks on the contributions that companies like Hawaii Biotech give to Hawaii’s economy. “There’s no question that it’s contributing to the innovation economy,” Hanabusa told PBN. “And it’s also pulling in a lot of federal grants.” The Hawaii Biotech receives more than $6 million annually in federal grant contract revenue from the Department of Defense and National Institutes of Health and has received close to $75 million in grant and contract revenues since its inception in 1982. “It’s technology in the ultimate form,” she added, referring to the company’s work developing vaccines for viruses including dengue, Zika and malaria. “It gives people a sense of accomplishment, but more than that, it’s such a great sense of service.” Ige said companies like Hawaii Biotech are also contributing to a diversified economy, providing the Island’s youth with more access to future STEM jobs. “They are the innovators, the creators of the new economy and the jobs that pay more than typical,” he told PBN. “[The innovation economy] is about investment, equity and having the capital that Hawaii Biotech needs to continue their research, or once they discover something, to be able to take it to market. That’s where the job creation and all of that really begins to happen.” Anna Hrushka covers money and technology for Pacific Business News Home of the Day", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T03:20:02.501+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
