Countless Twitter trolls announced that they would be cancelling their subscription to the streaming network and sparking the hashtag #BoycottNetflix. \nThe chaos began with former Buzzfeed writer and current outspoken alt-right member Tim Treadstone arguing that Dear White People is promoting “white genocide.” He then encouraged his followers to cancel their Netflix subscriptions in protest alongside him. But because he forgot to blur out his email address when hastily sharing a screenshot of his cancelled Netflix subscription, Treadstone was then signed up for 7,000 mailing lists as comeuppance.

It just brought more attention to the series. Thanks, white supremacists, you really helped me promote my show.” \nWhen the film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2014, it was prior to the Black Lives Movement taking hold and of course, before the Trump administration shone a light on modern racial divides in America. \n“It does what the show is trying to do, which is to show you where we actually are, not where we think we are,” Simien said. \nOn his Facebook, Simien continued the conversation, writing, “To see the sheer threat that people feel over a date announcement video featuring a woman of colour (politely) asking not to be mocked makes it so clear why I made this show. I want those who are chronically unseen in the culture to feel seen. And I want those willing to extend empathy to experiences unlike theirs to understand their humanity more deeply.” \nThe series hits Netflix on April 28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T11:28:12.225+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
