(Photo: NBA) \nWill there be serious defense in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game this year? If Jemele Hill's team listens to assistant coach Fat Joe, maybe. \nRapper Fat Joe told the team in the locker room: \n\"We gotta play D even though it's a celebrity basketball game. I'm being serious. If ya'll wanna win, then you gotta play serious. Once you up 20, 30 points, you can act stupid and do whatever you want to do â€¦ We gotta contest every shot, we gotta rebound, we gotta get everybody in the game.\" \nAs Fat Joe says this the team shouts that they want to see a blowout and that they agree! It seems like the team is with him.
