The Dubai Police took to Twitter to inform motorists that the Floating Bridge has been temporarily closed. Attention: Floating Bridge is temporarily closed due to a fire accident. Kindly use alternative routes. #TrafficUpdates - Dubai Police???? ??? (@DubaiPoliceHQ) February 12, 2017 According to police, the bridge has been temporarily closed due to a fire accident. They have also advised motorists who take the bridge to seek alternative routes. In other parts of the city, massive congestion from Sharjah inbound to Dubai has caused motorists to slow down. This is the same case in the World Trade Centre roundabout going towards Sheikh Zayed Road. Road works along Dubai-Hatta Road has also caused a slow down in that area due to concern of falling debris. Motorists who are taking the said road are advised to drive carefully. Elsewhere, motorists driving towards Dubai from Abu Dhabi can expect light traffic conditions along Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Road and Sheikh Zayed Road.
