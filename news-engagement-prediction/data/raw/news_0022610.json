I think he’s on his way to becoming a legend,” Gavaskar added. \n“That’s something which is eventually going to happen sooner rather than later. \n“The way he’s batting, he’s going to rewrite the whole record book. \n“Most of the batting records, if not all of the batting records, are going to be his the way he’s going about scoring runs and scoring big runs in all forms of the game.” \nTendulkar, of course, went on to play international cricket until he was 40 — with longevity in the game another key factor in his incredible career. \nIt remains to be seen whether Kohli will be able to match that longevity, or how long he will be able to maintain his extraordinarily high level of play. \nCurrently he is 11,508 behind Tendulark’s extraordinary mark of 15921 Test runs, and has quite a bit of work to do to make good on Gavaskar’s prediction. media_camera Kohli shares a laugh with Tendulkar. \nKOHLI V TENDULKAR BY THE NUMBERS \nBY AGE: at age of 28 and 97 days, Tendulkar (2001, July 30) \nODIs \nKohli: 179 ODIs, 27 tons, 7755 runs at 53.11 \nTendulkar: 273 ODIs, 25 tons, 10,461 runs at 43.40 \nWhat Tendulkar went on to do over rest of career: 190 ODIs, 20 tons, 7965 runs at 46.85 \nTESTS: \nKohli: 54 Tests, 16 centuries, 4413 runs at 51.91* (after first innings in Bangladesh Test) \nTendulkar: 84 Tests, 25 tons, 6919 runs at 57.18 \nWhat Tendulkar went on to do over rest of career: 116 Tests, 26 tons, 9002 runs at 51.44 \nBY MATCHES \nKohli: 179 ODIs, 27 tons, 7755 runs at 53.11 \nTendulkar: 179 ODIs, 12 centuries, 6100 runs at 38.85 \nWhat Tendulkar went on to do over rest of career: 284 ODIs, 37 tons, 12326 runs at 48.52 \nTESTS \nKohli: 54 Tests, 16 centuries, 4413 runs* at 51.91 (after first innings in Bangladesh Test) \nTendulkar: 54 Tests, 12 centuries, 3760 runs at 51.50 \nWhat Tendulkar went on to do over rest of career: 146 Tests, 39 tons, 12161 runs at 53.40 media_camera Kohli hugs teammate Wriddhiman Saha after scoring a double century. \n‘MAKES THE OPPOSITION LOOK CLUELESS’ \nHere’s a gentle reminder for Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Australia’s spin brigade: don’t let him get you down. \nWhen Kohli strode to the crease on day one against Bangladesh, his side was 2-180: not in trouble, by any stretch, but certainly with the game still in the balance. \nNearly 75 overs later when he departed, Bangladesh’s chances had all but evaporated and their bowlers cut shattered figures. \nAll five of their main bowlers went for more than 100 runs. It was brutal vision for toilers across the land. And Kohli was the main reason for it. \n“He just upped the level of his game to such an extent where the Bangladesh bowlers looked helpless,” Gavaskar said. \n“They hadn’t bowled badly until he came in to bat. \n“When Virat came, he took the attack by the scruff of the neck and I think that is what makes him special. \n“He completely destroys the confidence of opposition bowlers. \n“While the others — Cheteshwar Pujara, Murali Yijay, (Lokesh) Rahul — are all very good, the man who dictates the pace of the game and the man who takes the game away from the opposition is Virat Kohli. \n“He makes the opposition look clueless.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T02:56:03.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
