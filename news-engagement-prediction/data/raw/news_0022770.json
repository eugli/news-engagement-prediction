Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. TraffickCam uses image analysis tools to identify hotel rooms used for suspected sex trafficking. Story highlights TraffickCam phone app could help police locate hotel rooms used for sex trafficking \"This is an easy way for citizens to take a stand against sex trafficking by simply taking photos,\" say its creators Join the CNN Freedom Project on March 14 2017 for #MyFreedomDay -- a day-long event when students around the world will be holding events to raise awareness of modern slavery. (CNN) A young girl poses provocatively in a dark hotel room. For a set fee, any willing customer can pay to have sex with her. For investigators attempting to track down sex traffickers and their victims, these online advertisements can contain critical clues. The smallest of details in a room could give away its location, but there are too many ads for law enforcement to scan each of them for clues. That's where TraffickCam comes in. It's a simple phone app that uses crowdsourced snapshots of hotel rooms to help law enforcement locate victims and prosecute sex traffickers. TraffickCam application Any travelers pit stopping at a hotel can turn on their phone's GPS location and upload photos of the room from four different angles to TraffickCam's database. Read More The idea is that law enforcement agencies can then check adverts featuring suspected trafficking victims in hotel rooms against TraffickCam's database of photos. Stand up to modern slavery on March 14 -- #MyFreedomDay TraffickCam's image analysis tools transform the photos into a number of data points, using features such as patterns on the carpet, paintings on the wall and landmarks out of the window. The various data points in the photos play an important role in matching the location. TraffickCam is the brainchild of Exchange Initiative and a team of researchers at Washington University. The initiative is funded by the non-profit St. Louis Community Foundation with the aim of ending sex trafficking. \"This is an easy way for citizens to take a stand against sex trafficking by simply taking photos,\" Kimberly Ritter, director for development for Exchange Initiative, tells CNN. Since launching in June 2016, Ritter says that more than 150,000 hotels have been added to the TraffickCam database. \"We have over 100,000 people using the app right now, and we're hoping that more will join us to take action and fight this fight,\" she says.
