The SEC requirement is part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill.\nThe CRA gives lawmakers 60 legislative days to nullify federal regulations by a majority vote if the president supports the move. Only one rule, an ergonomics regulation adopted under then-President Bill Clinton, has ever been overturned under the 1996 act.\nThe White House also endorsed overturning a rule allowing the Social Security Administration to provide certain records on people with a history of mental problems for inclusion in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, as well as rules on government methane emissions and contractor labor certifications. That measure passed the House 235-180 Thursday afternoon. \n“The Administration strongly supports the actions taken by the House to begin to nullify unnecessary regulations imposed on America’s businesses,” the White House said in a Statement of Administration Policy. “The regulations that the House is voting to overturn under the Congressional Review Act have established burdensome compliance regulations that force jobs out of our communities and discourage doing business in the United States.”\nSpeaking on the House floor Tuesday, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said the votes “targeting specific rules and stripping them from the books” would help deliver on Republicans’ pledge to drain “the swamp” in Washington.\n“Every single one of these will be gone,” McCarthy vowed after listing the five regulations. “With a vote in the House, a vote in the Senate and the signature of President Trump, we’ll get rid of every one of these job-killing and destructive regulations.”\nThe “stream protection rule,” issued by the Interior Department’s Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, has been a priority for repeal among GOP lawmakers since it was finalized in December. \nIt not only stops mining firms from polluting waterways, but also requires them to restore streams outside permit areas that have been damaged by mining operations. Companies would have to establish a 100-foot-wide corridor of native species along stream banks. While environmentalists had praised the rule, Republicans said it amounted to an effort to undermine energy companies and kill off jobs. \nSen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.) said Thursday the regulation “actually creates problems, costing jobs and completely reworking regulatory programs within the agency.” Reversing it, he added, was part of the GOP’s broader effort “to end the War on Coal and undo eight years of burdensome regulations” adopted during Obama’s tenure.\nBut the move has drawn sharp criticism from environmentalists, which have accused its supporters of placing the interests of the fossil fuel industry above the health and safety of affected communities. \n“This attempt to scrap the Stream Protection Rule is a clear case of putting polluters’ profits ahead of the basic well-being of vulnerable communities, and we must do everything we can to stop it,” said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, in a statement. “No matter who you are or where you live, you have a right to clean water — but this shameless attack puts families and communities at risk.”\nThe four Democratic senators who voted to overturn the rule — Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Claire McCaskill (Mo.) — all face reelection in conservative-leaning states next year. \n[ Why a federal disclosure rule is at the top of the oil industry’s wish list ] \nOil companies complained about the new SEC transparency rule, which advocates say would curb corruption, put them at a competitive disadvantage to foreign firms and be unduly expensive.\nJack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said in an interview that large oil and gas companies compete with state-owned companies that do not have disclosure requirements, and that the SEC rule would allow those companies to win contracts after seeing what U.S. firms pay.\n[ In a race to the finish. Obama finalizes rules to cement progressive goals ] \nRepublicans appeared to be targeting environmental regulations, but they also addressed the priorities of gun rights groups and the broader business community. While Obama’s administration had authorized the sharing of information on those receiving federal disability payments in an effort to ensure those with a mental illness were identified when gun sellers performed routine background checks, critics suggested it would prevent some Americans from obtaining lawful firearms. \nThe House on Thursday also approved by a 236-187 margin a resolution to overturn a rule requiring firms seeking federal contracts worth more than $500,000 to identify any labor laws they have violated in the last three years. In October a federal judge blocked initial implementation of the regulation. \nWhile the resolutions’ swift passage has pleased many industry officials, clean energy groups said it has introduced uncertainty into the market. \n“From a regulatory perspective, it is terrifying because we don’t know what the long-term implications of the passage of [Congressional Review Act] resolutions would be given the lack of legal history and judicial history about interpretations of the resolutions,” said Arvin Ganesan, former congressional liaison for EPA and now vice president for federal policy for Advanced Energy Economy. \nOne critical question is what the CRA law means in a clause that says once a regulation is revoked, no new “substantially similar” regulation can be adopted. \nGanesan said that there is no legal history, precedent or treatise to interpret that. \n“It’s the lack of clarity on what the passage would mean from a regulatory perspective” that is worrying so many envrionmentalists, Ganesan added.\nChelsea Harvey contributed to this report .\nsteven.mufson@washpost.com \nRead more at PowerPost", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T01:58:28.274+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
