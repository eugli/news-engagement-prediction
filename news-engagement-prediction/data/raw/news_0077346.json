Series driver to have his name etched on the Harley J. Earl Daytona 500 trophy after his victory in the 59th running of the Great American Race. \nThirty-eight different drivers have captured the checkered flag in NASCAR's biggest race at least once. Of those drivers, 11 have won the race multiple times. \nCheck out the history of winners in the Daytona 500: 1 Lee Petty, 1959 \nIt wasn’t referred to as the Daytona 500 in its first running but the 2.5-mile superspeedway was put on the map when a photo finish between Lee Petty and Johnny Beauchamp took over a week before Petty was declared the winner. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 2 Junior Johnson, 1960 \nThe margin of victory in the second running of the 500 wasn’t quite as close as Junior Johnson won by 23 seconds over Bobby Johns. The Petty father-son duo finished 3-4 with Richard a spot ahead of his father, Lee. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 3 Marvin Panch, 1961 \nIt was a 1-2-3 finish for Pontiac as Marvin Panch won in Smokey Yunick’s No. 20 car with Joe Weatherly and Paul Goldsmith behind him. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 4 Fireball Roberts, 1962 \nDaytona was dominated by Roberts in 1962. He won every race he drove at the track, including the 1962 Daytona 500 over Richard Petty. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 5 Tiny Lund, 1963 \nThe story behind Tiny Lund’s Daytona 500 win is truly amazing. In a sports car race before the 500, Marvin Panch crashed and caught fire. Lund pulled him out of the burning car and Wood Brothers Racing allows Lund to drive in the 500 for saving their driver. He goes on to win the race on a single set of tire. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 6 Fred Lorenzen, 1965 \nIn one of the shortest Daytona 500s in history, Fred Lorenzen wins the rain-shortened 333-mile event in the No. 28 Holman-Moody Ford. 7 Mario Andretti, 1967 \nThe only foreign-born winner of the Daytona 500, Mario Andretti drove the No. 11 Holman-Moody Ford. The open-wheel star had immense success in every form of racing he attempted. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 8 LeeRoy Yarbrough, 1969 \nIn an exciting finish, Yarbrough makes a last lap pass to grab the 1969 Daytona 500. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 9 Pete Hamilton, 1970 \nIn the Petty-blue Plymouth Superbird, Hamilton wheels his way to victory in the 12 th running of the Great American Race. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 10 A.J. Foyt, 1972 \nA.J. Foyt absolutely dominated the 1972 Daytona 500. He beat the entire field by a lap and was one of three drivers to lead during the race, finishing with 167 laps in the lead. This content is subject to copyright. The Enthusiast Network 11 Benny Parson, 1975 \nBenny Parsons, a fan favorite, won the Daytona 500 in convincing fashion by lapping the entire field. Bobby Allison finished second, one lap down. ISC Archives via Getty Images RacingOne 12 David Pearson, 1976 \nIn one of the most exciting finishes in Daytona 500 history, Pearson edged Richard Petty for the win after the two crashed coming off of the final turn. Petty’s car stopped just short of the finish line while Pearson got his car restarted and drove across the line for the win. 13 Buddy Baker, 1980 \nIn one of the sleekest-looking rides in all of NASCAR, Buddy Baker piloted the “Gray Ghost” to Victory Lane by setting a speed record of 177.602 miles per hour that’s still intact today. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 14 Geoff Bodine, 1986 \nBodine captured Rick Hendrick’s first Daytona 500 victory by defeating Terry Labonte and Darrell Waltrip. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 15 Darrell Waltrip, 1989 \nAfter trying for 17 years, Darrell Waltrip finally captured a win the Daytona 500. Waltrip broke out an iconic dance in Victory Lane as he celebrated. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 16 Derrike Cope, 1990 \nThis was a stunner, for sure. Cope was the beneficiary of another Daytona 500 misfortune for Dale Earnhardt. The Intimidator cuts a tire on the last lap and Cope takes home the trophy. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 17 Ernie Irvan, 1991 \nIn a race that ended under caution, Irvan beats Sterling Marlin for the 1991 500 victory. Focus on Sport Focus on Sport/Getty Images 18 Davey Allison, 1992 \nAllison made his mark at Daytona by finishing second behind his father in 1988 and finally grabbed his own Daytona 500 victory in 1992. ISC Archives via Getty Images RacingOne 19 Dale Earnhardt, 1998 \nAfter 20 years of frustration and heartbreak, Dale Earnhardt captured NASCAR’s biggest race trophy. A sea of crew members lined up on pit road to salute The Man in Black. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 20 Ward Burton, 2002 \nWhen Sterling Marlin decided to get out of his car to pull on his quarter-panel, Ward Burton was the beneficiary when NASCAR penalized Marlin. WireImage Kevin Kane 21 Kevin Harvick, 2007 \nThe scene at the finish in 2007 was a wild one. Harvick edged Martin by a nose for a photo finish as Clint Bowyer and the field crash behind them. Bowyer ends up rolling and escaping a fiery car in the infield grass. ©, David M. Vaughn 618-218-0236 Phone dvaughn@motorsportsimages.com David M. Vaughn 22 Ryan Newman, 2008 \nIt took over 30 years of trying for Roger Penske to finally get a Daytona 500 victory and Ryan Newman was the man who got it done for him. Getty Images Getty Images for NASCAR 23 2010, Jamie McMurray \nMcMurray’s pinnacle season took place in 2010. He won the Daytona 500, Brickyard 400 and fall Charlotte race. © F. Peirce Williams F.Peirce Williams 24 Trevor Bayne, 2011 \nIn one of the biggest upsets in sport’s history, the 20-year-old driver puts one of the most historic teams back in Victory Lane for the first time in 10 years. Wood Brothers Racing has won five Daytona 500s but none as shocking as the 2011 victory by Trevor Bayne. © , LAT South LAT South, LAT Photo USA 25 Joey Logano, 2015 \nThe Daytona 500 finished under the caution for the second-straight year as Joey Logano wins Roger Penske a second Great American Race. ©, Michael L. Levitt ©2015, Michael L. Levitt 26 Denny Hamlin, 2016 \nIn the closest finish since the advent of electronic timing, Denny Hamlin bests Martin Truex Jr. by 0.010 seconds as a parade of Toyotas cross the finish line. NASCAR NASCAR via Getty Images 27 Kurt Busch, 2017 \nAfter 12 attempts in the Great American Race, Busch earned his first career Daytona 500 victory in a battered No. 41 Stewart-Haas Racing Ford Fusion after a thrilling, wrecked-filled race. It was the organization's first victory with Ford after switching from Chevy to the Blue Ovals. 28 Dale Earnhardt Jr., 2 (2004, 2014) \nDale Jr. has continued his father’s legacy at the superspeedways by becoming a multiple winner of the Daytona 500. The first in 2004 was one of the biggest moments in Earnhardt’s career. He followed it up 10 years later by winning with Hendrick Motorsports in 2014. 29 Jimmie Johnson, 2 (2006, 2013) \nHis first victory started a run of five-straight Cup Series championships and his 2013 win led to his sixth title. The seven-time Cup Series champion has accomplished one of the biggest feats in NASCAR history, twice. Brian Czobat / autostock © 271 Fryling Ave SW Concord, NC 28025 W 704.786.2919 C 704.904.2745 autostock/Brian Czobat 30 Matt Kenseth, 2 (2009, 2012) \nRain played a factor in both of Matt Kenseth’s Daytona 500 wins. The first time he was the beneficiary of a rain-shortened race that ended with him up front. In the second one, he wins after the race is delayed to a Monday night feature. 31 Michael Waltrip, 2 (2001, 2003) \nMichael Waltrip ended a streak of 462 races without a win in one of the most emotional races in NASCAR history. Michael’s brother, Darrell calls the finish on FOX while Dale Earnhardt loses his life behind the 1-2 finish between Waltrip and Dale Jr. The 2003 Daytona 500 win was rain-shortened. Getty Images Getty Images 32 Sterling Marlin, 2 (1994, 1995) \nMarlin became the third driver in NASCAR history to win the Great American Race in back-to-back seasons. He joined Cale Yarborough and Richard Petty in accomplishing that feat. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 33 Bill Elliott, 2 (1985, 1987) \nIn the era before restrictor plates were added, Bill Elliott brought dominant speed to the superspeedways. He started on the pole in both of his victories in the Melling Racing No. 9 Ford. 34 Jeff Gordon, 3 (1997, 1999, 2005) \nOne of only five drivers to win the Daytona 500 three or more times, Jeff Gordon cemented his status as one of the best drivers in NASCAR when he won the 500 for the second time in 1999. He added a third Harley J. Earl trophy in 2005. This content is subject to copyright. Sporting News via Getty Images 35 Dale Jarrett, 3 (1993, 1996, 2000) \nFrom 1993 to 2000, it was a mix of Jarrett, Marlin, and Gordon win every Daytona 500 outside of Dale Earnhardt’s historic 1998 victory. Jarrett usually had one of the best cars all Speedweeks at Daytona, winning from second, seventh, and the pole in his 500s. Michael L. Levitt /LAT USA 36 Bobby Allison, 3 (1978, 1982, 1988) \nAllison won all three of his Daytona 500s with a different team and car number. His first victory came in 1978 in the No. 15 Bud Moore Ford. He won in 1982 while driving the No. 88 DiGard Motorsports Buick. His final victory in 1988 came in the No. 12 Stavola Brothers Racing Buick. Focus on Sport Focus on Sport/Getty Images 37 Cale Yarborough, 4 (1968, 1977, 1983, 1984) \nYarborough sits alone in second-place for most Daytona 500 victories and none of the drivers with three wins are actively driving so his place is safe for several years, at least. If Petty did it first, then Yarborough usually did it second in the 500. RacingOne ISC Archives via Getty Images 38 Richard Petty, 7 (1964, 1966, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1979, 1981) \nNobody can match Richard Petty’s dominance in the Great American Race. He was the first driver to win the race multiple times and achieved a mark that hasn’t been touched by winning the race seven times in a 17-year period.
