Kraft told him to “check online,” for fear that someone took it to pawn it off for big bucks. \nAt his MVP press conference on Monday morning, Brady confirmed that his jersey is indeed missing, and is calling upon everyone to help him find it if it shows up on eBay. “The jersey, I put it in my bag and I came out and it wasn’t there anymore. So it’s unfortunate because it’s a nice piece of memorabilia. So if it shows up on eBay, someone please let me know.” \nIn all the madness of the celebration, it’s easy for something like a jersey to get lost in the shuffle. The fact that it was taken out of his bag, though, is seriously concerning. \nHopefully it shows up because like Brady said, it’s a piece of history. If it does turn up, it’ll likely wind up in Canton at the Hall of Fame relatively soon.
