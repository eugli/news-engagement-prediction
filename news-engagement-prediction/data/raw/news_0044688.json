Drying out your phone (Photo: PA) \nThat desperate, heart-wrenching moment when your mobile takes a tumble into the toilet. But all is not lost, thanks to a few silica gel packets. \nFirst, remove the battery, SIM card and SD card (if there's one inside) and set aside, then put it in a bowl filled with silica gel packets to absorb the water.

There were drinks to be drunk, and beaches to lounge on. \nNow you've got wet clothes in your suitcase and it's the end of the world. Or not. \nThrow the wet swimming costume in a different bag with a few silica gel packets. It absorbs the extra moisture while you're traveling. No mouldy smell when you get home. 3. Protect your razor (Photo: Sunday Mail) \nDisposable razors can start to dull earlier than they should thanks to oxidation caused by moisture. Not really helpful if you keep your's in the bathroom. \nKeep razors in a Tupperware container with about five silica gel packets and they'll last longer. 4. Protect photographs \nDrop a few packets into a zip lock bag with your photos to make sure they don't get damaged by moisture. 5. Save those seeds \nOne for the gardeners. Keep your seeds from getting mouldy before spring comes around. \nPut them in small envelopes in an airtight container with silica packets. 6. Preserve pet food \nPet owners often buy pet food in bulk, but that means it can get soggy if moisture gets into it. \nKeep it in a plastic bin and tape a few silica gel packets to the inside. Dry food, happy pets. Read More Could your fiver be worth Â£50,000? There's just one rare Jane Austen note left in circulation in England... 7. Keep an underwater camera dry \nWhile underwater cameras might be OK while you're swimming, you have to be careful. A build up in condensation can leave streaky fog marks on your lens. Two packets of silica gel can absorb the left over water. No ghostly photos. 8. Save the food for later \nThis works better with root veg, pumpkins at Halloween and so on. \nNo one wants to eat the whole thing at once (if you do, how!?) but you can leave a silica bead into the flesh of your leftovers so it doesn't get damp and mouldy. It should keep it going for at least a week more. Hmmm all that pumpkin pie. 9. Sort out smelly gym bags (Photo: Getty Images) \nNo one likes a smelly gym bag. They stink. \nThe packets reduce the damp build up and - thank goodness - stop the odour-causing bacteria. While you're at it, shove one in your stinky trainers too. Everyone will thank you. 10. Get rid of the smell of musty old books \nIf you don't like the smell of old books (I do, there's something reassuring about it) you can prevent it. \nPop a silica gel packet into a bag along with the book, leave it for a few days and it will dry it out a bit. Maybe don't do this for a whole bookshelf, or a library. That'd take ages.
