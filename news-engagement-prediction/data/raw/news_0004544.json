This will help local MSMEs and electronics business,\" he said. \"Tentatively, they should start production by April 2017.\" \nEarlier, Karnataka government also issued an official reaction today regarding Apple's move. \n\"Apple's decision on initial manufacturing in Bengaluru has further enhanced the reputation of Bengaluru as the most preferred destination for foreign investment and further validation of the State Government Policies aimed at fostering manufacturing, innovation and investments in Karnataka,\" the state IT department said. \nApple has been in talks with the Centre about starting local stores and manufacturing in India. CEO Tim Cook visited the country last year and had a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding these matters. \nThe company asked for tax and labelling benefits from the government earlier for starting manufacturing. Apple has chosen Wistron as the manufacturer of the phone instead of its long-term partner Foxconn. \nRecently, in the company's earnings call, Cook hailed the Indian government's decision to demonetise high-value currency notes, saying that it will be beneficial for the economy in the longer term.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T15:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T10:52:10.389+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
