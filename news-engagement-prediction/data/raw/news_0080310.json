(Video: NSW Labor) More videos Sydney weather: Heavy rain on its way \nFebruary will end with parts of the New South Wales coast forecast to receive their biggest downpours since last winter with possible flooding in places. \nWhile it's more likely to be a \"Tasman low\" than the more damaging and drenching east coast low variety, coastal regions near the system will likely see steady rain with the potential for flooding, Mr Notara said. \n\"We have a perfect recipe for persistent rainfall along the eastern seaboard regardless of an east coast low occurrence,\" Jacob Cronje, a senior Weatherzone meteorologist, said. \"It almost looks monsoonal.\" Related Content Soggy end to summer masks another season of heat records for Sydney \nThe bullseye for rainfall is now forecast to centre around the Sydney region, but that could shift in coming days as models get a better fix on unfolding conditions. \nAny low that develops within the deepening trough that is now sitting off the east coast will draw moisture from the unusually warm coastal waters that have been a feature for months.
