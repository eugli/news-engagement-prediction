SMITH \nThousands of LGBTQ+ people and allies gathered outside of New York City's historic Stonewall Inn today to peacefully protest President Donald Trump's anti-LGBT cabinet picks and stand in solidarity with the immigrants and refugees affected by Trump's Muslim travel ban. Issued last week, and as of Friday night suspended by a federal judge , the ban would temporarily block refugees and people from seven Muslim-majority countries, as well as indefinitely barring all refugees from Syria. It's not only a religious matter: The ban would have a deadly effect on LGBT people from those nations , where, in some of them, being gay could get a person arrested, beaten, or killed. \n\"Join us in front of the Stonewall Inn as we stand in solidarity with every immigrant, asylum seeker, refugee and every person impacted by Donald Trump's illegal, immoral, unconstitutional and un-American executive orders. We will also speak out against Trump's selection of the most anti-LGBT nominees and appointees in modern history,\" read the event's Facebook page . \nTo give even more reason for the protestors to congregate, a draft of an executive order leaked this week that, if issued, would amount to authorization to discriminate against LGBT people , using religious freedom as justification. \nMore than a dozen advocacy groups and local politicians, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, sponsored the protests. New York State Sen. Brad Hoylman, speaking at today's afternoon rally, reflected on 1969's famous Stonewall riots that were the catalyst for the LGBT equality movement, drawing \"a parallel between the need to stand up for the rights of the marginalized then and now,\" as New York's Channel 4 reported . \n\"It's so appropriate that we are at Stonewall today, because we are here to say we stand up to oppression just like our LGBT brothers and sisters stood up to oppression that fateful evening: June 28, 1969,\" he said. \nU.S. Sen. Charles Schumer was also there: \"Let me remind people of why we're here,\" he said to the crowd. \"The pioneers at Stonewall were alone, but they fought and fought and eventually they won. We are gonna do the same thing!\" \nSee pictures from the rally below: Loading", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T07:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T02:45:29.965+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
