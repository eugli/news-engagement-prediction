It was to help the merchants,\" he said at the meeting.\n\"We are residents of the same neighbourhood and we are part of the same community.\"\nNew business association The newly formed NDG Business Association is hoping to organize festivals in the future.\n\"The community is merchants and residents alike and it's not an easy path to find a way that satisfies everyone,\" said association president Peggy Regan.\n\"We don't have a plan together. We are going to rely on your input and hope that we can come up with something and present it to the city.\" \nwith files from Sarah Leavitt", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T12:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T15:23:58.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
