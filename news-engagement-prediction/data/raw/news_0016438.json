Now they are worse! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 7, 2017 \n(Again, for the record, the Times issued a note to readers after the election results, but it did not contain an apology.) \nA lot of media observers have noticed Trump tends to tweet shortly after certain subjects are covered on cable networks (especially Fox News). Well, Trump tweeted tonight minutes after Maggie Haberman , one of the two Times reporters who wrote the article, defended its accuracy on CNN. \nShe told Anderson Cooper they asked the White House what exactly the inaccuracies are, and all they’ve heard so far is Spicer saying he doesn’t think Trump has a bathrobe (a small detail in the piece). \nShe was a little stunned by how much the reaction today focused on the bathrobes, telling Cooper the purpose here in part is to humanize the president and provide insight into how he’s adjusting to life in the White House. \nWatch above, via CNN.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T10:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T05:23:41.166+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
