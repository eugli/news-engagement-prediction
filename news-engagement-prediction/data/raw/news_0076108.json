Matter of fact, the system has also banned 70 people for violating the game’s code of conduct by communicating in an offensive manner. \n“After being flagged by EasyAntiCheat, suspect accounts are reviewed by the development team, which then hands out warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans against identified players,” reads a post on the Ubisoft Blog (thanks, Blue ). \n“These bans are applied on an account level, not at the hardware level. Fairness is hugely important to the game’s creators, so bans are being handed out to first-time offenders. \n“Players who believe they’ve been erroneously penalized can also appeal their bans.” \nThe anti-cheat system was having a few fits at launch on PC, so this week the studio released a hotfix , which incorporated changes to EasyAntiCheat error messaging notifications. It also fixed an issue where it was incorrectly blocking some players from entering the game. \nIf you need help playing For Honor so you won’t feel the need to cheat (sorry, I had to), our guide is here to help, regardless of your skill level. We update it almost daily. \nFor Honor was released on February 14 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One.
