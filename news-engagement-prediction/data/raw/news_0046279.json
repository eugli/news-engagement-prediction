It was ‘too far to walk to the terminal’ (Picture: Rex) \nIn 2004, a bridge in Indonesia became unstable and was in danger of collapsing due to the frequency of people weeing on the steel pillars holding it up. \nA source told the Sun: ‘It can be a real trek back to the toilet facilities at the staff centre and when you have to go you have to go. \n‘Eventually it emerged urine is quite corrosive and there was some issues with some of the Boeing 747s.’ \n‘No plane was in any danger but staff were told to stop and use the proper facilities.’ \nA spokesman for the airline told the paper that they had no record of any such warning being given. \nMetro has contacted BA for comment.
