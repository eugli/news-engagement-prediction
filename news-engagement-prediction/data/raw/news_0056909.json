The migrant route through South and Central America, Mexico and the U.S. has become a popular one from asylum seekers coming from Africa and Asia and destined for Canada. (Marc Robichaud/CBC) Related Stories 'Citizens should take action': U.S. Border Angel urges supply drops in Canada for asylum seekers \nOne of the world's busiest migrant corridors runs from Central America through Mexico. \nFor decades, migrants from the northern triangle of that region — Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala — have fled countries plagued by endemic levels of violence and crime in the hopes of crossing the Mexican border and eventually seeking asylum in the United States. \nBut migration experts say the profile of those using that route is rapidly changing. \nWith European borders tightening and increased anti-immigration anxiety in the United States, a rising number of migrants from as far away as Africa and Asia are turning to the Central American migrant corridor in the hopes of reaching a new promised land: Canada. \nTapachula, in the Chiapas region of Mexico, is a key transit hub on the Mexican-Guatemalan border. CBC News met dozens of migrants there, young men and women who fled their homes in Somalia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Ethiopia, Eritrea, India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Haiti. Sanctuary city movement grows in Canada \nMany say they began their journeys — which take between three and five months and cost upwards of $20,000 US — with Canada in mind. Others changed their plans and want to reach Canada in fear of U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration policies. \nAll have faced extraordinary journeys to reach Tapachula — threatened by smugglers, robbed at gunpoint, trekking through jungles with little food or water. Border crossing A map showing the route many African migrants take - with the help of smugglers - to get to Canada. (CBC) \nThe majority of African and Asian migrants enter South America through Brazil or Bolivia, countries that don't require visas. \nThey travel by boat, bus or foot through Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Guatemala — countries that grant them temporary visas of 20 days to transit through the country — before reaching the Mexican border. \nAlmost none speak any Spanish. They are easy targets for violent smugglers and extortion by immigration agents along the well-trodden route. An asylum seeker's desperate journey to Canada \nMost say they met migrants of their country of origin in almost every country they crossed. \nBy the time they reach the Mexican border, they are often travelling in groups of between five and 20 people. \nThey cross into Mexico by raft at an informal but dangerous river crossing used to transit guns and drugs as well as people. \nWhereas most Central American migrants pay approximately $1 US to cross, African and Asian migrants are charged nearly 10 times as much. Latin America's biggest detention centre Protests against overcrowding are a regular occurrence at the immigration centre in Tapachula, Latin America's largest. (Marc Robichaud/CBC) \nThe immigration centre in Tapachula is the largest in Latin America. Protests against overcrowding are a regular occurrence inside. \nMany of the hundreds of thousands of Central American migrants who cross into Mexico are often detained here before being deported by bus back to their countries of origin. African and Asian migrants, whose countries do not have deportation agreements with Mexico, line up outside to apply for a temporary transit visa. \nLast year, the immigration centre in Tapachula registered 442 African migrants in a single day. Simanto, 25, Bangladesh Simato, who didn't want to be photographed head on because he fears for his safety and the safety of his relatives, says his family in Bangladesh sold everything they had and gave him $4,000 US to make the trip to Bolivia and through the Central American corridor to the U.S. (Marc Robichaud/CBC) \nSimanto arrived at the Tapachula detention centre on a hot Sunday afternoon with five fellow migrants from Bangladesh, India and Nepal. \nA Hindu, Simanto fled his home after a spike in violent attacks against his country's long-persecuted minority group. \nthe 25-year-old says his family, which sells fish, sold everything they had and gave him $4,000 US to make the trip to Bolivia and up through the Central American corridor to the United States. Asylum seekers flee U.S. border patrol by scrambling over snowbank into Quebec \nBut Simanto, who wished not to show his face or use his last name because he fears for his safety and the safety of his family at home, says he doubts he will be granted asylum in the United States. \nHe says he is considering trying to reach Canada and may risk crossing illegally into the U.S. to do so. He owes that to his parents, he says, who gave up everything to help him leave Bangladesh. Pierre Gracia, 21, Haiti Pierre Gracia left Haiti with others who want to reach Canada, but they aren't sure how they will get there. (Marc Robichaud/CBC) \nMany attempting to reach Canada through the Central American corridor are economic migrants. \nPierre Gracia, 21, left St. Marc, Haiti, with a group of nearly 20 country men and women. They say the immigration policies of U.S. President Donald Trump have scared them into remaining in Mexico for now rather than passing through to the U.S. \nThey aren't sure how they will reach Canada, but say it is their country of preference.

(Marc Robichaud/CBC) \nThey call her Mama Africa. \nConcepcion Gonzalez Ramirez runs a $3-a-night hostel just off of Tapachula's main strip that is known among the African migrants who pass through Mexico. \nMany migrants stay here in groups, planning their next steps or waiting for friends who have been detained by immigration authorities before proceeding north. Informal network helping asylum seekers get to Manitoba \nRamirez says she teaches the migrants who stay here about the local food and often provides them with small change to buy coffee and bread. \nShe says people often prey on the migrants, believing they have access to cash, but she lives with them and knows that they travel with only the clothes on their backs, often eating only one meal a day. Rahma, Somalia Women following the migrant corridor encounter further risks such as exploitation along the well-trodden route through South and Central America. (Marc Robichaud/CBC) \nWomen face additional risks along the migrant corridor, including sexual assault and exploitation. \nRahma, who wished not to show her face or use her last name because he fears for her safety and the safety of her family back home, says she fled Somalia after her husband was killed. Her uncle helped her secure a passport and connect with a smuggler who helped her reach Brazil. \nRahma spent six days in Tapachula's detention centre before being released. After several months travelling across South and Central America, she says she's too scared to enter Trump's United States. Khadr, 31, Somalia Khadr, who didn't want to show his face for fear it would endanger his safety, fled Mogadishu's civil war and is determined to reach Canada. (Marc Robichaud/CBC) \nKhadr fled Mogadishu and that country's civil war . \nThe 31-year-old is staying in the Mama Africa hotel with nearly a dozen other Somalis, all of whom are on 20-day visas that run out in less than two weeks. They are unsure of what to do next. \nKhadr, who also wished not to show his face or use his last name because he fears for his safety and the safety of his family back home, says the Canadian people and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau are welcoming of refugees, citing Canada's resettlement of Syrians. \nHe says he lost one of his toes while trekking through the Darien Gap, the wild jungle that connects Panama and Costa Rica. He knows Ghanaian refugees have also lost fingers and toes crossing the Canada-U.S. border in freezing temperatures, but he says nothing will stop him from reaching Canada. African and Asian migrants whose countries do not have deportation agreements with Mexico come to the immigration centre in Tapachula to apply for temporary transit visas. Their destination used to be the U.S., but since Donald Trump took office, more and more are considering Canada.
