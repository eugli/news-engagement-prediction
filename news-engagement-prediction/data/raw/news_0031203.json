When you step away from that, there's one thing you can absolutely be assured of, you're going to be in opposition,\" Mr Joyce said. \n\"This is a disappointing move. I hope the architects of it clearly understand the ramifications of the decision that they're a party to.\" Follow all the day's political developments in our live blog. \nMr Joyce also warned the WA Nationals might be tempted to retaliate in the future by running candidates in urban seats. \n\"The game could be played in any way — we won't, but it could easily be that the National Party could stand in every Lower House seat in Perth and preference another party. What would that mean? You'd lose a heap of seats, as simple as that,\" he said. \n\"Colin Barnett has been around the political game a long while. He should seriously consider whether he thinks this is a good idea, or whether he's flirting with a concept that will ultimately put his own side, his Liberal colleagues, in opposition.\" \nThe Liberals and Nationals in Western Australia have a more antagonistic relationship in Western Australia than they do in the eastern states. \nThe two parties are in power together, but they do not govern in a formal coalition. \nBut the deal has still angered Nationals heavyweights in Canberra, who are increasingly concerned about the electoral challenge that a resurgent One Nation poses in regional areas. \nNationals MPs lined up to criticise the WA Liberals as they entered parliament house this morning. \n\"[The Liberals] will need the National Party if they're going to have a hope of forming government, and always remember who your friends are,\" Victorian Nationals MP Andrew Broad said. \n\"It seems a bit desperate I've got to say and when you go and make friends with people who don't share the same values of you, it makes it very hard to form a government.\" \nNationals MP Mark Coulton also questioned the deal. \n\"I don't know whether it's all that smart of a move. The Nationals have done an amazing job. The Royalties for Regions, they've really stood up for the bush, so I wouldn't think that the One Nation would be in the ascendency in a lot of those places,\" he said. \n\"People in Western Australia and people in the bush have got good memories and are loyal and they understand those who are fighting for them and the Nats in Western Australia have done a great job.\" \nFinance Minister and Western Australian Liberal powerbroker Mathias Cormann brushed off the criticisms — pointing out the Nationals had previously preferenced One Nation and several other minor parties ahead of the Liberal Party. \n\"In 2013 both the Liberal Party and National Party preferenced the Shooters and Fishers, the Christian Democrats and the Family First party ahead of each other. This is just business as usual,\" Senator Cormann said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T06:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:35:17.926+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
