By Sara Boboltz \nFormer Scientologist Leah Remini said Tom Cruise could “singlehandedly” end Scientology on a Friday night episode of “Real Time with Bill Maher.” \nThe “King of Queens” star whose A&E docuseries “Scientology and the Aftermath” shows how the organization negatively affects its members appeared on the show just after host Maher let alt-right poster child Milo Yiannopoulos off with some light, teasing banter . \nThe actress confirmed that even celebrity supporters like Cruise or John Travolta are required to conform to many of the organization’s strict rules for members, including hours of studying each day. \n“He [Cruise] could end this singlehandedly,” Maher interjected. \n“He could end this. Correct,” Remini said, adding, “Because they are saying he singlehandedly is clearing the planet, is changing the planet, so most Scientologists believe.” In Scientology, “clearing the planet” is the process by which “body thetans,” or aliens that members believe inhabit the planet, are eliminated. The actress has previously stressed how highly Scientology members regard the “Mission Impossible” actor, whom she called their “ messiah .” \n“Milo, you’ve got nothing on this Scientology shit,” Maher joked at one point during the interview. \nIf Cruise could use his influence to hit back at Scientology, it doesn’t seem like he will anytime soon. The actor is one of the organization’s most prominent supporters, and according to Remini, the rules are often bent for him. \n“That was part of the hypocrisy,” she said. \nMembers of the organization, Remini explained, are even taught to think that the actor’s failures ― such as the 2016 flop “Jack Reacher” ― are due to “suppressive people,” or detractors of Scientology such as herself, working against him. \n“Scientologists believe that if he didn’t make it [’Reacher’] a hit, it was because there were suppressive, evil people working against him, because he’s winning in life and clearing the planet,” she said. \nCatch the whole thing above.
