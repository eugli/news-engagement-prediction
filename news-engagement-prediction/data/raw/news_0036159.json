In fact, Jack Parsons is barely acknowledged on Nasa’s website, and he’s the man who made rockets a reality and co-founded the agency’s Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), home to missions which paved the way for the Apollo programs and continue to explore Mars and outer space today.\nIf Parsons’s life story was a film script, it would be dubbed preposterous.
