After a federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the immigration order temporarily banning refugees and nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, the Department of Justice filed an appeal of the order on Saturday night, saying it’s the “sovereign prerogative” of a president to admit or exclude aliens and that the court shouldn’t “second-guess” the president’s orders.\nThe Dept. of Justice asked that an emergency stay be issued pending the appeal to resume Trump’s ban efforts. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco instead asked for the Trump administration to file a counter-response by Monday afternoon and denied the emergency stay.\nOn Saturday, the 70-year-old president attended the annual American Red Cross fundraising gala with wife Melania , 46, during his first weekend getaway to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida since taking the White House.\n“We’ll win,” Trump told reporters at the event about the appeal. “For the safety of the country, we’ll win.”\nTrump on immigration appeal: \"We'll win.
