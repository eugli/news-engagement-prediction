DAVID WALKER/FAIRFAX NZ \nKyle Park on Waterloo Rd has been named as a possible location for a $34 million pool, library and service centre facility in Hornby. \nA combined facility was preferred by the council because it would cost $2.5m less to build and would be $120,000 cheaper to operate annually. \nREAD MORE: \nThree possible locations have been highlighted by council staff as the most suitable for the facility, including Denton Park, Kyle Park and Warren Park. DAVID WALKER/FAIRFAX NZ \nWarren Park on Wilmers Rd is one of the possible locations for a $34 million pool, library and service centre facility in Hornby. \nCouncil staff considered 16 sites and have ranked them based on access, location, cost and availability. Locations that needed to be purchased at a significant cost, were too small or could delay the project were given a low priority. \nIn a report to the Halswell Hornby Riccarton Community Board, council recreation and sports head John Filsellâ€‹ said all of the identified sites had drawbacks, and there would not be a universally accepted ideal site. \nCommunity feedback would soon be sought before a final decision was made. \n\"The project has progressed to a point where community engagement is essential to it proceeding any further.\" Ad Feedback \nDenton Park was deemed the most suitable by council staff, with a score of 80 per cent. It was a high profile site, at a good location and close to transport links. The council owned the land, but it was in high demand as a sports field. \nKyle Park on Waterloo Rd scored 68 per cent, because it provided good access and room for expansion, but the loss of open space and sports grounds would need to be considered. \nWarren Park scored 62 per cent because it was not in a central location and was just 5 kilometres from the Halswell library and pool. \nA combined facility would be up to 4400 square metres, include a library, gym, indoor lane swimming and leisure water play areas, community meeting rooms, customer service facilities and areas for the council's community governance staff. \nHalswell Hornby Riccarton Community Board chairman Mike Mora said he wanted the project to proceed as fast as possible because the community had been waiting far too long already. \n\"Hornby has been suffering from an acute lack of swimming facilities.\" \nRiccarton Ward councillor Vicki Buck said the southwest had grown dramatically since the Canterbury earthquakes and it was important everyone in the city had access to such facilities. \nIt was hoped the project would be completed by mid-2019. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T02:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T02:08:00.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
