I wouldn’t be doing it if I didn’t think it was going to get the result.” \nLNP opposition leader, Tim Nicholls, said on Monday he had offered his MPs a conscience vote but that “every single member of the LNP party room indicated that, in good conscience, they cannot support these bills”. \nLNP reservations about Pyne’s proposed changes included that they “make it legal for a woman to secure her own abortion without medical supervision – including by the use of illicitly obtained drugs”, Nicholls said. \nPyne, who believes such fears have been overblown, said he expected the Law Reform Commission recommendations to “remove the impediment” to an LNP conscience vote. \nAnti-abortion campaigners who have scrutinised MPs’ positions on abortion have predicted the changes would narrowly pass with an LNP conscience vote. \nPyne said the government, which asked him to withdraw the bills to allow the commission referral, had pointed to the speed with which reforms to expunge historical gay convictions were assessed. \n“To just say, ‘Go to hell’ would be indulgent on my behalf,” he said. \nAbortion is allowed under Queensland’s criminal code only if a doctor rules it is necessary for a woman’s physical and mental health.
