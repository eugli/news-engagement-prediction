There were a ton of openings, with seven in particular that got us really jazzed (mainly a chic champagne bar and SF’s first Portuguese restaurant), as well as a few really big restaurant announcements. But just as high as the highs were, the lows were there, too, with the abrupt closure of AQ and Hawker Fare Oakland just around the corner. Beyond debuts and shutters, the news this month got people fired up (The NY Times focus on Locol), nostalgic (Uncle Joe’s grilled cheese stop), and silly (Chron critic Michael Bauer’s love letter to Taco Bell). Read on for a summary of the Bay Area restaurant world in January 2017, including the most-read news stories and maps, the openings, the closings, and what to get excited about in the months to come. Big Openings The Riddler : This chic and tiny Hayes Valley champagne bar has been mobbed from the minute it opened, and with great reason: It’s a sexy space with lots of bubbly, caviar, and good-looking people. Uma Casa Patricia Chang Uma Casa : It’s hard to believe that before Uma Casa, San Francisco didn’t have a full-fledged Portuguese restaurant. Chef/owner Telmo Faria (Tacolicious) took care of that this month with the opening of his modern, but still traditional space in Noe Valley. Over Proof : ABV in the Mission turned its upstairs loft into a quarterly-changing, reservation-only tasting menu cocktail bar with food that focuses on a different spirit each time. First up is a rum-focused, tiki-infused bar with creative cocktails and paired bites, and it’s a whole lot of fun. Alba Ray’s : It’s a raging Cajun party over in the Mission at this New Orleans-themed restaurant from the guys behind Causwells and Popsons. Head here for hurricanes, sazeracs, and jambalaya. Kinjo : The Ijji owners have teamed up with Takatoshi Toshi, Sushi Ran ’s Michelin-starred former head sushi chef, to open this edomae-style omakase spot ($120 per person) in Russian Hill. Halal Guys : It’s finally here. This famed chicken-and-rice restaurant that started as a NYC street meat stand has made its SF brick-and-mortar debut in the Tenderloin, to much ado. 1951 Coffee Company : There may be no better time than this month for a coffee shop that exclusively employs refugees to open. It’s in Berkeley — go and visit. Exciting Coming Attractions A rendering of Dad’s Luncheonette Alexis Liu Dad’s Luncheonette : After spending the last three years at the three-Michelin-starred Saison (one year as chef de cuisine), helping blast it to number 27 on the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list , Scott Clark is opening a roadside stand in Half Moon Bay. Called Dad’s Luncheonette, it will be a casual, counter service stand with fun dishes under $15 like a chicken fried hen of the woods mushroom sandwich with instant ramen slaw. The French Laundry Hotel : Thomas Keller, owner of The French Laundry and the man who can do no wrong in the eyes of dude chefs, dropped a hint that he’s looking into opening a small inn on the French Laundry property. Hazel : Since Cadence’s heartbreaking closure six months after its debut, the Mid-Market shutters have just kept rolling in, with Bon Marche , Oro , Volta , and more quickly following suit. Can this Southern comfort food restaurant, moving into the old Cadence space, make it work in the struggling neighborhood? Major Shutters Hawker Fare Oakland Eater Archives Hawker Fare Oakland : Chef/owner James Syhabout is closing his much-loved (so beloved, in fact, that writer John Birdsall penned it a moving elegy ) Isaan Thai spot due to the building becoming condos. The upside is that the SF location will remain open. AQ : This one’s a so-San Francisco story. Despite opening with tons of accolades, the seasonally-focused Californian AQ could not keep its profits up, due to a complicated set of factors that boils down to rising costs and a lower number of customers. Les Clos : Saison co-founder Mark Bright’s wine bar closed so he can focus on other projects, but the good news is that it’s becoming Petit Marlowe, a Paris-influenced Marlowe wine bar spin-off.
