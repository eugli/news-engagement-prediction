What makes India so successful in space launch business of 6 Next Prev Play Slideshow ISRO: The dark horse 15 Feb, 2017 With today's record launch of 104 satellites by ISRO—the highest number of satellites ever launched in a single mission—India has stormed into the elite space club. Let's take a look at the reasons which makes ISRO stand out in the space mission and gives a tough challenge to Elon Musk's SpaceX: Low-cost edge 15 Feb, 2017 India's space launches beat those by advanced countries due to the low cost. But India's low-cost edge may not remain forever as latest technology developing in the US might reduce costs drastically. M.O.M 15 Feb, 2017 Mangalayan mission cost India $74 million while the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Mars program cost it $671 million. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said India had spent less to reach Mars than Hollywood spent on a mere movie on space mission, Gravity, which cost $100 million. Space X's Falcon-9 15 Feb, 2017 The cost of SAARC satellite launch scheduled next month is estimated at Rs 236 crore and PSLV launch is pegged at Rs 90 to Rs 100 crore. But the European space agency's Ariane-5 rocket launch costs Rs 721 crore while the US space manufacturer Space X's Falcon-9 costs around Rs 500 crore. The determinist 15 Feb, 2017 Elon Musk's Space X is developing reusable rockets which will cut costs significantly. India too is developing reusable launch vehicle but it's low-cost edge will depend on how fast India develops this technology.
