The couple, who want to raise the money for three lots of treatment, say that it is their \"human right\" to be able to have a child - regardless of their employment status.\nSarah, 24, said:\nPeople have said, \"Why don't you just go and jump on a p***s and get pregnant?\", but they don't understand that we physically can't do that. You wouldn't say that to a straight person.\nPeople have given us so much stick for doing this - but we just say if you don't like it then don't donate.\nI have always known I wanted kids - but growing up and knowing I was different I never thought it would be possible.\nBut now I have my beautiful wife and can't imagine it with anyone else.\"\n– Sarah Cruickshank-Maltby The couple, from Middlesbrough need to raise £7,000 Credit: PA The couple from Middlesbrough, claimed that they have been denied a loan by Zebra Finance, who allow monthly payments for IUI, because they have poor credit scores and are on benefits.\nUnemployed Chelsea, says she can't work because of her asthma and aims to be a stay at home mum.\nThe 25-year-old added:\nMy employment status will not make any difference to the baby's upbringing. Some parents think, income income income - but they don't have time to bond with the child.\nPeople have asked us why we haven't tried getting a donor online for free but that way you don't know if that person has STDs or genetic conditions. When we went on Facebook to see what kind of donors were out there we were horrified to see that a lot of them were just fake profiles.\nWe did try it once with an online donor and we got a bun in the oven, but we had a miscarriage at four weeks - and our world came crashing down, we were heartbroken.\nWe just want to give ourselves, and other couples who are struggling, a chance if they are on benefits or have a bad credit score. We are preparing the house now for the baby coming - I will be the one carrying the baby.\nWe want to have two biological kids, one carried by each of us, then two adopted siblings.\"\n– Chelsea Cruickshank-Maltby The couple say they just want to complete their family Credit: PA Admin Agency worker Sarah, who works unpredictable hours, added:\nWhat is wrong with asking people for help, when we have always helped people all our lives.\nWe just want to complete our little family.\"\n– Sarah Cruickshank-Maltby The couple set up their Go Fund me Page on Saturday February 5 and have so far raised £55.\nLast updated Tue 7 Feb 2017 Health Middlesborough", "external_links": ["https://www.gofundme.com/chelsea-and-sarahs-baby-journey"], "published": "2017-02-07T23:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T10:35:26.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
