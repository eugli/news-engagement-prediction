Twitter \nBickley deleted his retweet after it was labeled “disgusting” and “repellent” by other users of the social media network. \nIn a statement to Huff Post UK, Bickley said: “Yesterday I retweeted a cartoon about the potential consequences of Labour’s support for uncontrolled immigration without realising it relied on a rhyme that had been used in an election in 1964 in racially abusive context. \n“I have since deleted the retweet and apologise for any offence caused.” \nLabour MP David Lammy was one of those to draw a comparison between the cartoon and the notorious Smethwick campaign.
