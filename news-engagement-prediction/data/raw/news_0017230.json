Images. When Beyoncé announced Wednesday that she was not only pregnant, but pregnant with twins , the social-media world seemed, for a moment, to lose its damn mind. Her initial Instagram post broke the record for the most-liked post of all time (sorry, Selena Gomez ), while a follow-up series of ethereal, underwater photographs on her Web site sent fans into hysterics. “Where were you the day Beyoncé’s pregnancy announcement broke the Internet?“ they’ll ask. But some were concerned , considering just how pregnant she is, whether she’ll be able to headline this year’s Coachella music festival in Indio, California. We shouldn’t have worried, through, because of course she will. The festival and Bey’s two secret guest performers (!) have known about her current situation for months, TMZ reports. She has “no intention” of cancelling and has already made housing arrangements for her guests, who remain, for now, anonymous. By April, Bey will just about be in her third trimester, so there’s really no telling how she’ll choose to do her performance. There’s already a precedent for using a chair, as Foo Fighter Dave Grohl did after breaking his leg in Sweden in 2015. And while Beyoncé is well known for her powerful, kinetic performances featuring tons of backup dancers, if anyone could hold a crowd’s attention just by standing in front of a mic and singing, it’s her. She’s also sang on stage while pregnant before, performing for the 2011 VMAs Glastonbury and at the Billboard Music Awards when she was early into her pregnancy with Blue Ivy . We can try to predict all we want, but what we should most prepare for is to be surprised. This is unannounced-album-dropping, social-media-breaking, earring-wound-ignoring , HBO-dominating Beyoncé, after all. And even if something happens and Bey can’t perform (yes, it’s always a possibility), she could still be set for a massive paycheck. TMZ reports that the singer is expected to receive more than $1 million for her two-night performance, whether or not she turns up, thanks to a standard insurance policy for stars of her caliber.
