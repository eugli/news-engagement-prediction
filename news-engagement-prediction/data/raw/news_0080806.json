Unfortunately for Bannon and company, it appears that they still have no earthly idea what to do instead . \nHere's \"President\" Trump today, reportedly \"exasperated\" by the complexity of the task at hand: \n\"Now, I have to tell you, it's an unbelievably complex subject,\" he added. \"Nobody knew health care could be so complicated.\" \nNobody knew! I like to imagine Trump asking his aides to print off the Affordable Care Act Wikipedia article for him to read, and then requesting the Simple English version when that proved to be too much, and then when that proved no less opaque, flying into a rage before letting off some steam with some good all-caps tweets. This Washington Post description of Trump's \"ostensible\" repeal plan as it stands today makes a very strong case for the development of a universal Dripping With Sarcasm font. \nWhile leaving most of the detail work to lawmakers, top White House aides are divided on how dramatic an overhaul effort the party should pursue. And the biggest wild card remains the president himself, who has devoted only a modest amount of time to the grinding task of mastering health-care policy but has repeatedly suggested that his sweeping new plan is nearly complete . \nIt's perfectly reasonable for Shadow President Bannon to look at the electoral math and realize that eviscerating their base's access to healthcare isn't the brightest of ideas. The problem, though, is that the White House has yet to articulate any alternative path forward, and lots of very powerful people appear quite happy to advantage of this uncertainty. In addition to entertaining Paul Ryan's morally bankrupt scheme to steal from the poor and give to the elderly, the president recently met with Scott Walker, Rick Scott, and John Kasich—the unholy trinity of Republican governors who will never be president—to hear out their probably-horrific reform proposals. Trump's giddy, awed reaction to Kasich's pitch makes him sound like your one coworker who somehow just discovered The Dress, and is delighted by it. \nOver the next 45 minutes, according to Kasich and others briefed on the session, the governor made his pitch while the president eagerly called in several top aides and then got Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price on the phone. At one point, senior adviser Jared Kushner reminded his father-in-law that House Republicans are sketching out a different approach to providing access to coverage. “Well, I like this better,” Trump replied, according to a Kasich adviser. \nFor good measure, on Tuesday, President Trump talked over repeal efforts with the CEOs of some of America's largest health insurers, because, you know, who better to help write a groundbreaking reform bill than a bunch of dudes with an incentive to make medical care as profitable as possible? \nhttps://twitter.com/POTUS/status/836261554135924736 \nThe emerging leadership vacuum on this issue could prove troublesome for the Trump administration, because their public indecisiveness opens the door for some clever opportunist—Ryan, McConnell, private insurance companies, the three extremely thirsty governors, or even the moderator of the Atlas Shrugged reading group nearest you—to hijack the process. All Speaker Ryan has to do is get his proposal in front of Trump, really—since the president admittedly doesn't know what he wants, Ryan's odds are good that Trump will nod, stroke his chin thoughtfully, and go along for the ride. Even if further reflection might reveal that what's good for Paul Ryan is bad for Donald Trump, this president has proven much more interested in appearing decisive than he is in doing anything that resembles governing. \nThis type of self-inflicted damage doesn't happen when a president maintains any ideological consistency, develops substantive policy ideas, or hews to some set of cognizable principles. But if an unsophisticated White House vacates the field, people who do do those things are going to try and slide into it. And even if the results prove wildly unpopular and leave millions of Americans sick, uninsured, and angry, it's going to be the Trump administration left to face the music.
