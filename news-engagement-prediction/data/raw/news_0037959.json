He’s the third-oldest skater to ever lace them up, and still has another seven years and 11 days to beat Gordie Howe.\nThat’s fine, since Jagr has said he wants to play until he’s 55 years old; which, given the way he trains, is not a crazy thought. (What’s the record for consecutive one-year contracts signed by a player?)\nJagr began his NHL career in 1990 and won the Stanley Cup in each of his first two seasons with the Pittsburgh Penguins . Twenty-seven years later he’s still schooling fools out on NHL ice surfaces. Since he’s turning 45 today, we wanted to wish him a happy birthday by listing 45 reasons why we love him.\nEnjoy.\n1. Don’t let your future Christmas seasons be without Jagr Claus:\n2. Capitalizing on his star power, Jagr unveiled his own line of peanut butter in 1996, which also contained magic groin-healing powers .\n3. Down 4-1 in the opening game of the 1992 Stanley Cup Final, Jagr made a couple Chicago Blackhawks look silly with this set of moves to help start the Penguins’ comeback.\n4. The mullet that was so good in the early 1990s that Jagr decided to bring it back a few years ago . Since he wants to play until his 50s, there’s a good chance if he keeps it growing it will reach the peak length it did in the ‘90s.\nView photos\nCanadian professional hockey player Mario Lemieux #66 (left) and Czech colleague Jaromir Jagr #68 of the Pittsburgh Penguins stand with the Stanley Cup, early 1990s.

His 1990 Score rookie card used his draft day photo, which led to Mr. Irrelevant in 2008 to describe it as Jagr “letting his bangs breathe.”\nView photos\nScore / Mr. Irrelevant More 6. His 2016 Halloween was better than yours:\n7. If you’re going to sleep with Jagr and then try to blackmail him , save your energy. He won’t care. And you may also create a viral meme at the same time.\n8. He’s part of the exclusive Triple Gold Club, which means he’s won gold at the Olympics (1998), World Championship (2005, 2010) and won the Stanley Cup (1991, 1992). There are currently 27 players who have won all three, with Jagr being one of two Czechs (Jiri Slegr).\n9. Jagr became the fifth Czech athlete to be named flag bearer for the Winter Olympics when he did the honors for the 2010 ceremony in Vancouver.\n10. He was nearly drafted by the Flyers. Jagr went No. 5 overall in the 1990 NHL Draft to the Penguins. The Philadelphia Flyers picked Mike Ricci and No. 4. Earlier that spring, it seemed as if the Flyers were going to no doubt take Jagr with their first pick, until something changed.\nFrom the Post-Gazette :\nHe said he expected to play for the Philadelphia Flyers, who drafted fourth, and not the Penguins, who drafted fifth. A European scout had watched him closely, and he knew the Flyers GM at the time, Bobby Clarke, liked him a lot.\nPenguins forward Jaromir Jagr stretches prior to a light practice at Civic Arena May 12, 1992. Jagr scored two goals in a victory over the New York Rangers in Game Five of the conference playoffs the night before. The Penguins went on to win the Stanley Cup.\nClarke was fired two months before the draft, and the Flyers’ draft strategy changed.\n“One-hundred percent I thought I was going to Philly,” Jagr said. “They had talked to me and said, ‘We’re taking you.’ I was surprised when they didn’t call my name.”\n11. Nobody loved denim more than Jagr and Martin Straka:\nView photos\nJagr/Straka More Read More 12. His name forms the anagram “Mario Jr.”\n13.

If you camp outside of his house he may just bring you a sandwich:\nIn hopes of snapping a picture of Jagr with his girlfriend Veronika, one Czech photographer was surprised to see the future Hall of Famer come out and greet him with a sandwich. “You deserve this for your patience. Hockey taught me to respect my opponents,” Jagr told him.\n21. P.K. Subban’s tribute at 2016 NHL All-Star Skills Competition:\nSubban honored the living legend during the event by donning a No. 68 Florida Panthers jersey and putting on a mullet wig. That total package helped the then-Montreal Canadiens defenseman defeat Brent Burns a.k.a. Chewbacca in the Breakaway Challenge .\n22.

Mario Lemieux scored in his first game out of retirement on Dec. 27, 2000, and of course it was Jagr setting him up for the goal.\n28. He made history with his butt:\n“It hit my ass.”\n29. He used to drink 10 cups of coffee a dayBut then Lent arrived on the calendar, as he told the Wall Street Journal :\n“I was drinking 10 a day,” he said. “I felt awful the first few days, I felt like I had no energy at all. I was playing games I didn’t even know I played, the first few games. But then the body got used to it.”\n30. He really wants a monkey. In a TSN piece in December , Nick Bjugstad told Frank Seravalli that Jagr said he was going to buy a monkey for the young Panthers forward and himself. Told that might be illegal, Jagr responded, “If people can have poisonous snakes, why can’t you have a monkey?” Good point.\nNick Bjugstad got the monkey off his back with his first goal of the season – so Jaromir Jagr got him a monkey for Christmas as promised. pic.twitter.com/MckEHujzPw\n— George Richards (@GeorgeRichards) December 22, 2016\n31. He owns his hometown hockey team, which has a great logo. Jagr came up through the Kladno system and in 2011 purchased a majority stake in the Czech team. His father, Jaromir, runs it and after they took over, they changed the logo, which is one of the best in hockey.\nView photos\nKladno More 32.

He was on the ice during Wayne Gretzky’s final game:\nView photos\nAP More Gretzky’s final NHL game occurred on April 19, 1999, the final day of the 1998-98 season.
