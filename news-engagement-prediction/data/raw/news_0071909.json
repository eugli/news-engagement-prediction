Story continues below \n“The bus driver pulled over to the side of the road when she felt it was unsafe to proceed given that the students on the bus were loud and disruptive,” Peel Region District School Board spokeswoman Carla Pereira told Global News. \nREAD MORE: Ontario ombudsman reviews Toronto school bus delays \n“What she did was just wait on the bus for approximately twenty minutes to see if the students were quieting down.” \nWhen they didn’t, the school board said the bus returned to the school where the vice principal told the kids to settle down. \n“At that point, the bus driver did finish the route,” Pereira said. \nREAD MORE: ‘Where’s My Bus?’ GPS system lets parents track school buses \nThe school bus route is only three kilometres long and normally takes only minutes to drive. \nFor parents left waiting at the bus stop, it was a stressful hour waiting for their children. The school board said it sent a message to parents about the delay, but not everyone got the message. \nJashanmeet Dhillon’s five-year-old son was one of the kids on the bus. He said his son was hungry and afraid when the bus finally brought him home. \n“He was crying, he was really crying badly,” Dhillon said. \nDaljit Beniwal’s children, who are seven and eight years old, were also in tears and didn’t want to ride the bus anymore. \n“When they came off, they were hugging me saying, ‘Mom, I never want to go back to school, I don’t want to take this bus,” Beniwal said. \nAccording to the Students Transportation of Peel Region rules, school bus drivers must “always deliver students to their scheduled destination even if they display unruly behaviour.” \nDespite calls from parents for the driver to be removed from the route, she remains on the job. However, she is now accompanied by a senior bus company representative. \nFor parents, that’s not good enough. \n“I don’t feel my kids are safe,” Beniwal said. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
