My favorite movie is Labyrinth, I collect marionettes, and I love the formality of Downton Abbey , so I look at a dog like this as a living performance, a fantasy creature, or a thing of excess. His name is Zephulet, who was said to be a famous ghostwriter. The only person who’s ever known who that is was a retired guy who stopped me on the street from The New York Times Magazine or The New Yorker, I don’t know the difference anymore.\nDo a lot of people stop you guys on the street?\nAll the time. So many women. My dating life has doubled. If you have a life that consists of puppets, golf, and cigars like mine does, it almost guarantees you’ll be single. With Zephulet, it’s as if I were a naked girl walking down the street — that’s how much attention I get. It’s almost annoying. A few years ago, I would have been begging for this, but now it’s like I don’t want to talk about how old he is, whether he’s going to get any bigger, or if he’s going to change color, you know?\nLightning Round\nNeighborhood : Noho.\nFavorite restaurant : Candle 79 . “I’ve been in an ongoing fight with myself for 20 years over whether or not I’m a vegetarian.”\nFavorite book : “I love Lolita . I read it every two months or so.”\nFavorite street : “I like little nooks like Jersey Street or Minetta Lane or Grove Street.”\n*This article appears in the February 20, 2017, issue of New York Magazine.\nTags: look book street style mi-ki men with dogs new york magazine The Man (and Dog) Who Constantly Get Stopped on the Street\nHow to Wear Sneakers When You're Not in Your 20s…\nGlamour\n17 Best Sephora Shopping Tips and Easy Tricks to Save…\ngoop\nThe Body Whisperer's Fat-Flushing Workout\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.vulture.com/2017/02/kellyanne-conway-goes-full-fatal-attraction-on-snl.html", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679723161", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/the-man-and-dog-who-constantly-get-stopped-on-the-street.html%3Fmid%3Dfb-share-thecut", "http://traffic.pubexchange.com/l/db1a9572-737a-40c7-8c53-37b4b60f95a1/ab3c7a02-3ac7-4c96-8bc5-632a4c4a588c/ef756d35-cd86-4e67-a130-6d980ca3d518/f?u=whowhatwear.com", "http://www.vulture.com/tv/downton-abbey/", "http://cliqueimg.com/cache/posts/189860/outfits-to-wear-with-sneakers-over-age-30-2016-189860-1460671066-promo.300x0c.jpg);", "http://traffic.pubexchange.com/l/db1a9572-737a-40c7-8c53-37b4b60f95a1/a0e152b3-d182-4050-b6f6-2f56d3e21991/5c1f36c1-f199-4d2c-a2dd-f92dbd309d5b/f?u=glamour.com", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58a2358572fd07fa155905c6/1:1/w_125/sephora_1024-1.jpg);", "http://www.whowhatwear.com/outfits-to-wear-with-sneakers-over-age-30-2016", "http://goop.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rolling-Shell-Goop-1-150x150.jpg);", "https://www.pubexchange.com/home/index/nymag", "https://twitter.com/share?text=The%20Man%20(and%20Dog)%20Who%20Constantly%20Get%20Stopped%20on%20the%20Street&url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2017/02/the-man-and-dog-who-constantly-get-stopped-on-the-street.html%3Fmid%3Dtwitter-share-thecut&via=thecut", "http://traffic.pubexchange.com/l/db1a9572-737a-40c7-8c53-37b4b60f95a1/6a3545d1-3f03-40d5-be9c-b3e7d50316a6/3faafe84-b52f-4653-a34b-dcb821440f03/f?u=goop.com", "http://www.glamour.com/story/sephora-money-saving-tips", "http://goop.com/the-body-whisperers-fat-flushing-workout/"], "published": "2017-02-21T04:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:30:12.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
