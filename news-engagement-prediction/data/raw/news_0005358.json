Edited Excerpts: \n\nIs there any review of the LTCG definition, is the LTCG tax being re-introduced, any form of changes in the short term capital gains tax, those are the clarifications that we would want from you at this stage? \nAs far as the long-term capital gain is concerned it is mostly in the area of property where I think the period of holding has been really reduced from three years to two years so there is nothing more than what is contained in the budget speech and in any case the finance bill is now in the public domain so there is nothing of that sort. \n\nBut having said that let me mention just to as an opening remark I think overall if look at it, the budget is strong with regard to the fiscal numbers. The budget is strong with regard to the macroeconomic underlying basis of the budget and the budget is also very strong with regard to reforms. I think that is something which should not be lost sight of. I have listed out the number of reform measures which have been announced in the budget speech and there are about 11 or 12 of them. \n\nStarting with abolition of FIPB I think it should be seen as a huge reform and plus also in the agricultural sector we are talking in terms of introducing a model law on contract farming, on removing perishables from the APMC market so on the whole if you see the budget is very strong on reforms and that should not be lost sight of. \n\nCan you throw some light on how is the government going to go about divestment with a target of Rs 70,000 crores in FY18? \nWith regard to divestment, the listing of CPSE is a clear roadmap with regard to a revised mechanism with time lines is going to be spelt out so there is a list of central public sector enterprises which are expected to list themselves in the market and time lines will be fixed for listing them and talking about the target. This year the insurance, the general insurance companies are going to be listed, then there will be the listing of three major public sector enterprises in the railways sector, the IRFC, the IRCTC and these companies have huge valuations. \n\nSo therefore putting together the target which has been fixed about 70 or 71 thousand crores is very much achievable. It is very much within the reach plus listing of several other public sector enterprises are also going to take place . So therefore 71,000 crores is a very carefully arrived figure and it will be done.
