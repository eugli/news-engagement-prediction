Stacked in his bedroom are production and press books from the string of 1990s gay hardcore films that won him a shelf full of awardsfilms like Flesh and Blood and More of a Man . In a closet, there are bound volumes thatdocument the Yugoslavian shoot of the 1975 bisexual-chic landmark Score , which he wrote; a poster for his earlier play version, featuring the young Sylvester Stallone in a supporting role, graces the living room wall. And buried somewhere are outtakes from The Back Row , his gay milestone from 1972.\n\nThe collection is fit for an archive. Thankfully, it's headed to oneeventually. At 81, porn pioneer Douglas says he \"can see the end of the tunnel more and more clearly.\" Now, he's thinking seriously about history and how it's preserved. \n\"I don't want my life's work to end up in a garbage dumpster,\" he told me.\n\nA series of pornographic film posters in Jerry Douglas's New York apartment. Photo by Whitney Strub\nWhen it comes to porn, that's exactly what usually happens.I've heard firsthand accounts of the records and letters of now-dead pornographers departing for landfills in trash bags. When Douglas'spapers enter the holdings at New York University's Fales Library, as they will upon his death, it will offer a virtually unparalleled documentary record of modern hardcore history.\n\nPorn archives are, paradoxically, everywhere and nowhere. It's relatively easy tofind smutty Victorian novels and mimeographed sex storiesin places like the British Museum and even the Library of Congress. It's the behind-the-scenes materialthe scripts, storyboards, and production memosthat remain elusive. You can find such documents for mainstream American filmin numerous collections held at UCLA, USC, and elsewhere,but if you'relooking for the counterparts inthe history of pornography, where do you even begin?\nThere are a few early examples:There'sthe Samuel Roth papers at Columbia University, which offer a rich window into mid-century print sleaze. Roth, who published the tawdry Violations of the Child Marilyn Monroe in 1962, lost a 1957 Supreme Court case that created modern obscenity doctrine, and his papers are both fascinating and detailed. Ralph Ginzburg, who served federal time for publishing smut like Eros and The Housewife's Handbook on Selective Promiscuity , gavethe Kinsey Institute a collection of 1960s hate mail he received. It's awindow into theanger thousands of Americans directed at his Jewishness, his depictions of interracial sex, and more.(The collection also contains thesingle oddest thing I've ever encountered in an archivea biohazard bag containing the human shit that wasmailed to Ginzburg and thendutifully preserved.)\nBut archival collections dry up during the 1970s, when hardcore cinema moved aboveground. I recently co-edited a book, Porno Chic and the Sex Wars: American Sexual Representation in the 1970s , and the contributors dug up material that greatly expands our historical narrative beyond the obvious canon of Deep Throat and The Devil in Miss Jones : Shaun Costello's 1975 hardcore Christmas Carol adaptation, The Passions of Carol ; Bob Guccione's failed \"Penthouse for women,\" Viva ; forgotten magazines like Female Impersonator News ; and the autoerotic gay smut of Peter Berlin. All of these left texts to study, in the form of movies and magazines. But none left an archive of its production, distribution, or reception.\n\nJerry Douglas's porn awards. Photo by Whitney Strub\nThe single best repository for hardcore history is probably Rialto Report , a collection of oralhistory podcasts and deeply researched essays about the 70s and 80s. Butscholars have been slow to make use of it, probably out of misplacedanxiety about the fact that it's housedonline rather than in a university library. Indeed, the only extensive archive of a hardcore filmmaker that I know of is the Candida Royalle Papers , still being processed at Harvard's Schlesinger Librarywhere the pioneering feminist pornographer's records join those of her opponents Andrea Dworkin and Women Against Pornography, the 1980s feminist sex wars preserved in archival amber, forever counterpoised.\n\nThis absent hardcore archive isfelt by historians. For most of the quarter-century since Linda Williams's groundbreaking study Hard Core: Power, Pleasure, and the Frenzy of the Visible ,academic porn studies was dominated by film scholars, more committed to textual analysis than historicization. But a coalescing movement of porn historians has grappled with how to do justice to the complexity of porn's undocumented past. In her recent book A Taste for Brown Sugar: Black Women in Pornography , Mireille Miller-Young scoured everything from privately-held stag film collections to internet message boards to recover lost histories, brilliantly detailing, for instance, one unnamed woman's onscreen labor negotiations with a money shot in the 1930s. In another recent book, Smutty Little Movies: The Creation and Regulation of Adult Video , Peter Alilunas crafts an entire methodology, which he calls \"trace historiography,\" to unearth the adult film industry's transition to home videos in the 1970s.He's literally doing scholarly research through eBay auctions at times, but imagine what the business records of a sex motel, or the diary of that unnamed stag performer, would add here.\n\nThat's effectively what Jerry Douglas's collectionoffers. His papers hold screenplay drafts, memos to actors about their characters, his life's correspondence, and more. Not everything has been preservedthe full script for his 1993 film, Jock-a-Holics , for example,was left on top of a car and blew away. But what's there is invaluable in fleshing out porn history, on multiple levels from the material legacies of smut (crystal buttplugs from Beyond Perfect , Douglas's second-to-last film in 2005 and purchased over the producer's cost objection) to the personal lives of those lost to the AIDS epidemic (Gerald Grant, who performed in straight, gay, and bi porn, is commemorated through a beautiful scrapbook compiled by his lover). Shooting logs show Douglas carefully plotting performers' orgasms (marked with an \"o\"), and among his abundant outtake footage is apparently a climactic would-be threesome in More of a Man (1991) in which a horny extra decided to make it a foursome and Douglas interrupted the orgy to obtain a mid-coital release form. Thirty-eight boxes remain unpacked from whenDouglas and his partner moved in 1994, so who even knows what else is there?\n\nDouglas's archive came to NYUby way ofMarvin J. Taylor, thehead of special collections at NYU's Fales Library. In addition to collecting everything from punk history to cooking books, Taylor is a strongadvocate ofarchiving smutsilver print French photographs of two young men having sex from about 1905, over a thousand gay and lesbian pulp novels, and 40 cubic feet of porn with a BDSM emphasis in the recently obtained Richard Marshall collection, all grace Fales. Taylor acknowledges the \"occasional raised eyebrow\" about his acquisitions, but he doesn't mind. This is important historical material, and after all, he said,\"It's just sex. Lighten up.\"\nLooking back at his life's work, Douglastold mehe feels more like Salieri than Mozart. But Ithink he's looking at it wrong. Through his archives, he's poised to be a rare andunique tour guide to the history behind the hardcore lens.\nWhitney Strub is the author of Perversion for Profit: The Politics of Pornography and the Rise of the New Right and Obscenity Rules: Roth v.
