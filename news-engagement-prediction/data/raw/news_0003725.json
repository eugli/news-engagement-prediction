That is why we sell them,' said a shopkeeper in Amritsar, who requested not to be named.\nBanned in the 1980s, memorabilia of Punjab's militancy first resurfaced in the state almost a decade-and-a-half ago.\nThe Golden Temple in Amritsar India. In 1984 it was the scene of an assault by the Indian Army as they sought to flush out Sikh separatists.\nIn 2003, a year after Shiromani Akali Dal leader Parkash Singh Badal lost power to Capt Amarinder Singh, Bhindranwale was declared a martyr by the Akal Takht - the highest seat of the Sikh temporal authority in Amritsar.\nThe head of the Akal Takht is an appointee of the SGPC, which was then - and is even now - controlled by the Badals. Khalistani objects, slogans and the 2003 co-option of the dead militant figure both by moderates like the SAD and radicals aside, supporters of a separate Sikh homeland lost popular support long back in Punjab.\nCaptain Amarinder Singh is leading the GOP charge in poll-bound Punjab\nSince the mid-1990s, Khalistan has never been a rallying point in state elections.\nBut mainstream political parties of Punjab have routinely been accused of dabbling with separatists.\nThe approach to the 2017 elections is no different.\nKhalistani supporters in New York holding images of Bhindranwale march to press for a separate nation. For the Sikh diaspora though, the most urgent problem plaguing Punjab is drugs for which they blame both Akalis and the Congress.\nDelhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, whose Aam Aadmi Party is debuting in Punjab's Assembly elections, is facing the same accusations of courting pro-Khalistan elements among Sikhs living abroad.\nIn past elections, the Badals and Capt Amarinder Singh have hurled similar allegations and counter-allegations at each other.\nAt present, there are mainly two Khalistan advocacy groups in the state.\nOne is the Dal Khalsa that pledges no allegiance to the Indian Constitution. The other is Simranjit Singh Mann's Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar), which is struggling in electoral politics for over years now.\nSikhs commemorating the 31st anniversary of the assault known as Operation Blue Star, which saw the storming of Sikhism's holiest shrine the Golden Temple in Amritsar, by Indian troops on June 6, 1984\nUnlike SAD (Amritsar), the Dal Khalsa does not participate in state or national polls.\n'We boycott elections under Indian dispensation,' said Kanwarpal Singh, the group's spokesman.\n'We are a votary of an independent, sovereign Punjab. We want Sikhs to be given the right of self-determination,' he said, insisting that his group has no truck, covert or overt, with any political party.\nA fierce opponent of the Badals for their alleged misuse of SGPC and other religious institutions, the Dal Khalsa clarified it had nothing in common with AAP either.\nFormer Punjab chief minister and Congress candidate Amarinder Singh paying obeisance at Golden Temple after his victory in Lok Sabha\n'AAP is not pro-Punjab or pro-Panth (the Sikh community),' Singh said.\n'It's a pro-Indian party, with strong nationalistic streaks. We are poles apart.'\nFringe Khalistani leaders overseas share the Dal Khalsa's ideological position.\nOn numerous occasions, they have been seen protesting visits of Indian Sikh leaders - from across the political spectrum - to their countries of residence.\nThey would oppose the Badals, Capt Amarinder Singh and even then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the first Sikh PM, alike.\nNew York-based Sikhs for Justice, for example, has even accused Manmohan Singh of 'funding crimes against humanity perpetrated upon the Sikh community in India' as finance minister.\nBack in Punjab, the Badals have now come under fire from moderate Sikhs as well, largely because of their handling of religious issues.\nAfter all, they also govern the community's top religious administration, the SGPC.\nThe dominant bloc of moderate Sikhs was stunned when the Akal Takht pardoned Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Raheem in 2015.\nHe was accused of blasphemy for dressing up like Guru Gobind Singh. Many Sikhs felt the pardon was orchestrated by the Badals.\nThe ruling family, however, denies the charge. Sikh protests forced the Akal Takht to revoke its remission later but not before it had dented its institutional credibility.\n'Those who are worried about their faith and want to restore the glory of their religious institutions cannot be termed extremists,' said Kiranjot Kaur, a senior SGPC member.\nRepairs begin at the Golden Temple after the operation in 1984 in Amritsar\n'It's their right to work democratically to cleanse the system of malpractices.' In New Jersey, 53-year-old Dilvar Singh Sekhon runs a successful gas business.\nSekhon, who migrated to the US back in 1996, is pro-Khalistan.\nBut at present, his concern is not his 'political demand' for a separate nation but drugs in Punjab. 'Punjab's youth are in a crisis. They are drowning in drugs,' he rued.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T01:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T13:40:04.030+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
