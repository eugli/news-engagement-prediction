With Oscar weekend around the corner, it’s safe to assume the A-listers, with the help of their power stylists—like Petra Flannery dressing Emma Stone for her best-actress nod in La La Land —have their chosen gowns tailored and ready for Hollywood’s biggest night. But what about those in the shadows of the limelight, the lesser-known directors, producers, wives or daughters of so-and-so, and other below-the-line talent who will walk that same carpet and want to look the part? “They should be able to feel just as great as the person whose picture is syndicated around the world,” stylist Erin Walsh, who works with Kerry Washington, Thandie Newton, Amber Heard, and Sarah Jessica Parker, told Vanity Fair on a recent phone call. Walsh is one of the stylists on call with Armarium , a service that helps women who don’t have personal stylists get outfitted in designer wear for major occasions. While some stars, like Bryce Dallas Howard, have decided to forgo a stylist after working with them in the past, Armarium’s clients want the professional touch for a rare red-carpet outing. Courtesy of Owen Kolasinski. “You can sort of tell the women who haven’t worked with a stylist before, because they’re not sure what your role is sometimes,” said William Graper, who has styled Sarah Paulson and Elle Fanning for fashion editorials, at Armarium’s Los Angeles pop-up (open until February 26 at 8550 Melrose Avenue). “I like to help with everything, from zipping the dress to doing up the shoe. Women want to do everything themselves, never wanting to put anybody out, so it definitely takes a minute for them to be accepting and receiving of that TLC, but I tend to love those women, because they’re the most excited. . . . They leave smiling ear to ear, it’s a transformation of sorts.” Graper was helping a first-time client, a PR agent, find a dress for Elton John’s upcoming Oscar party. “For this, it’s a little more fun, glamorous, over the top, and there will definitely be photographs taken,” said the stylist. After browsing the options, from Naeem Khan to Christopher Kane, the duo picked out a few selects, and in the end, the client settled on a Kris Goyri gown. It’s black with a deep V-neck and slit in the front, while the back surprises with its pop of green. Retailing at $1,460, the dress will cost $250 to rent for four days with the option of extending (the company, which has a showroom in New York City, provides complimentary, temporary alterations, dry cleaning and includes a return label, when ordering online). Graper helps to complete the look with earrings, a clutch, and heels. Current trends? Sequins, leather, velvet, and experimental colors, according to Walsh. “People are much more willing to make a fashion statement,” she continued. “Fashion is so much more out there. It’s not just for the insiders anymore. It’s much more accessible.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:52:28.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
