Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nThe only thing funnier than Democrats pretending to care about the Constitution is their pretending they would put country over party. Like Sarah Silverman here, quote tweeting Adam McKay, trying to shame the GOP for something Democrats have done for decades. Hey @GOP this is spot on. Please KNOW that we know: you are choosing party over country. You tell us w every action & inaction u take https://t.co/BGQxxAVGwc \n— Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) February 17, 2017 \nOf course Democrats are so smug and self-centered they assume their party IS the country, so they can’t understand their own hypocrisy. \nOr they deliberately ignore reality; maybe a little bit of both. @SarahKSilverman You mean like Obama and DOJ did with investigating Hillary, coverup on plane discussions, passing laws without reading them \n— Sam Griffith (@staypufd) February 17, 2017 Trending 'The REAL heroes': Katy Tur compares journos to firefighters, causes EPIC amounts of eye rolling \nOops. \nParty over country much? But hey, GOP elected someone as president so that means they put party over country, right? \nThe stupid … it burns. @SarahKSilverman @GOP how quickly you forget about Hillary's conduct and the actions and inactions that were taken to cover that bs up. \n— Anthony Sokolowski (@sok_anthony) February 17, 2017 \nDid they forget or is this more of a deliberate ignorance? @SarahKSilverman @GOP lol dems have been destroying in for 8 years \n— NYNY Capital (@ameritradeyes) February 17, 2017 \nLonger than that but true. @SarahKSilverman @GOP Didn't Dems choose party over country when they decided to rig the primary against @BernieSanders \n— Daniel Eymann (@DanDaneymann) February 17, 2017 \nAnd there is the BIGGEST “up yours” the Democrats pulled with the election; rigging their own primary so Hillary could have “her turn”. They literally made it where the candidate who may have had a chance didn’t even get past their own primary. \nTalk about party over country. \nRelated:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T18:27:04.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
