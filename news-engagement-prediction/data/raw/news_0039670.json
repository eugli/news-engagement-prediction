It’s hard to imagine that in the Premier League these days. Bayern Munich got their summer business done quickly (Picture: Getty) \nStill, while Hummels has settled well after becoming the latest star poached from rivals Borussia Dortmund, Sanches hasn’t made a huge impact so far, so this Bayern side is pretty similar to the one Arsenal faced last season. \nOn the way out in the summer were largely bit-part players, though Mario Gotze and Medhi Benatia were two of the more notable names to make way. Any positives for Arsenal? \nAs already mentioned, Bayern only finished second in their Champions League group, which, Atletico Madrid aside was not the most challenging set of teams either. \nIf you buy into the idea that the Bundesliga is not competitive, their sole defeat this season has come to main challengers Borussia Dortmund, suggesting that they’re not necessarily going to be that equipped to deal with opposition of Arsenal’s calibre. \nAside from that, for Wednesday night at least they have some key players missing. Franck Ribery and Jerome Boateng have both been ruled out, while there’s uncertainty if Xabi Alonso will make it back on time. Ancelotti has the squad to cope, of course, but those are three players he’d dearly love to have for a big game. Xabi Alonso could be a big miss for Bayern (Picture: Getty) \nMuller’s lack of form could also be good news for the Gunners – he has four goals in his six meetings against them, including a brace in last season’s 5-1 thrashing at the Allianz Arena. \nLet’s face it, though – Bayern have one of the best squads in Europe and a manager with serious Champions League pedigree. You’d have to say it would be a minor miracle if Arsenal can get past them. \nMORE: Arsenal’s best 5 Champions League wins as they eye Bayern Munich shock More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T14:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T13:47:22.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
