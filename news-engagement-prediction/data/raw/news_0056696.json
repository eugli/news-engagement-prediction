Surveillance video shows he was accompanied by four other people, police said. \nThe woman only saw three others, according to police documents. Two approached her vehicle and one remained near the back. \nAs the woman began talking to the person who asked her for directions, he pulled out a pistol and told her to exit her car, police said. She tried to drive away and was shot in the face. \nShe managed to drive several blocks and then called the police, according to police documents. Police released her 911 call, in which she can be heard speaking slowly to a dispatcher, saying she had been shot. The dispatcher keeps her on the line for details while help is sent to her location. \nThe woman was taken to a hospital in critical condition but is expected to survive. \nPeoria police ask anyone with information to contact the department at at 623-773-8311 or Silent Witness at 480-WITNESS. 84 CONNECT 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2lt0qzn TOP VIDEOS ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T15:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:21:42.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
