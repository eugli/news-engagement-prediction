On Tuesday’s broadcast of “ The Late Show with Stephen Colbert ,” the British host of “ Last Week Tonight ” acknowledged he “probably” won’t be deported because he has a green card. But Oliver said he now accepts that under Donald Trump’s presidency, there is “a non-zero chance of it happening.” “I have an American wife and an American son now, but who knows what’s enough?” Oliver said. “Having a green card used to be enough, and yet what we saw with that executive order on immigration, that debacle, things are not what they were supposed to be.” \nOliver, whose wife served as an Army medic in Iraq, also took issue with the treatment of Afghan and Iraqi translators held up at the border following Trump’s executive order banned refugees and visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. \nThe translators are people “who have bled for a country they’ve never visited, have sacrificed family members for this country,” Oliver said. \nTrump telling people whether they would benefit America or not was “a little hard to swallow,” he added, because the president “has done neither of those things.” \nOliver made similar comments on Tuesday’s broadcast of “Dan Rather’s America” show on SiriusXM, when he labeled Trump’s order as “viscerally offensive.” \nCheck out full clip above and listen to his radio appearance below: Related Coverage", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T17:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T12:10:39.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
