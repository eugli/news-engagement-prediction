The team has been using the $30.2 million structure for off season workouts for the past few weeks but its impact stretches further than just the development of players. \nAccording to second-year head coach Kirby Smart , the new addition to the Butts-Mehre Heritage Hall played a major role in recruiting. \n“It’s a large impact,\" Smart said of the facility's role in recruiting. \"The indoor facility being finished when it did, timed up just right for some recruiting momentum. We had 10-12 guys in over the last couple of weekends (on visits). The ‘oh’s’ and ‘ah’s’ for getting to see that space? And utilize that space? It’s been really a big advantage for us, that we were able to sell.\" (Photo: UGA Athletics: Cory A. Cole) Not a member?

For years recruits have visited other programs and saw that fact with their own eyes. Whether or not it has actually cost the Bulldogs a recruit will probably remain unknown, but the fact remains that it certainly didn't help matters. \nThat's why Smart and his staff didn't wait until the facility was ready or even started before they began selling it to prospects. That started right away. \n\"A lot of these kids visualized it. They saw it from the ground up,\" Smart said. \"They sat in my office and saw big cranes out there, dirt, bricks and mortar and next thing you know they’ve got a finished product.” \n(What's next for the Bulldogs?
