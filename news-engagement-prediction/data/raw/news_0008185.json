Let's go back to where it all began. \nDuring Portland's win over Memphis, Parsons came up woefully short on a 3-point attempt, so the Trail Blazers' Twitter account had a little fun at his expense. To be fair, the NBA 3-point line is really, really far away from the basket. pic.twitter.com/dHusI9cHcW â Trail Blazers (@trailblazers) January 28, 2017 \nParsons saw the joke after the game and fired back with a tweet of his own pointing to the Trail Blazers' current spot in the Western Conference standings. \nPortland is 21-27, good for ninth in the West, while the seventh-place Grizzlies hold a 27-21 record. @trailblazers good luck in the lottery show this yearâđť â Chandler Parsons (@ChandlerParsons) January 28, 2017 \nThen McCollum jumped in with a brutal counterpunch. We hit the lottery by not signing you https://t.co/eSiBaNT061 â CJ McCollum (@CJMcCollum) January 28, 2017 \nUppercut to the chin! Down goes Parsons! \nYou may remember Parsons signed a four-year, $94 million deal in the offseason. It hasn't worked out for the Grizzlies so far, as Parsons has struggled with injuries and only averaged 6.7 points per game in limited time.Â \nParsons did remind McCollum he still has that contract. @CJMcCollum stop it. Technically, I hit the lottery. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-29T03:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T12:08:32.481+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
