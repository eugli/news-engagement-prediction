Sands is a popular Leicester restaurant (Photo: Leicester Mercury) \nThey issued an order which shut the restaurant immediately - and diners were told to leave. \nA spokeswoman for the council said: \"A resident of the district made us aware that a pest control company had been visiting Sands. \n\"We served a hygiene emergency prohibition order on Sands of Glenfield for a cockroach infestation, on Saturday, February 4. \n\"The business is now formally closed as a food business until our environmental health team are satisfied that the health risk condition no longer exists. Bugs and eggs were found in the kitchen (Photo: Leicester Mercury) \n\"We are working closely with representatives of the business and their pest control company to advise them about the steps they need to take in order for this to be achieved. \n\"Once Sands have completed the work they will need to notify us and our environmental health team have two weeks to re-inspect the premises. \n\"Once satisfied, Environmental Health would then need to serve a notice lifting the closure which would allow them to re-open.\" \nInspectors returned to the restaurant on February 7 to carry out further investigations, and found more evidence of cockroach activity. Things were far from spotless (Photo: Leicester Mercury) \nA person who was in the restaurant at the time posted on review website TripAdvisor: \"We had a meal there on 4th Feb. \n\"During our meal, the restaurant advised us they had to close due to an incident.
