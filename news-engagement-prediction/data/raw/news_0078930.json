Source: Tweet \nReserve keeper Shaw resigned during the week after a furore over his decision to eat a pie in the dugout during the National League side's FA Cup defeat at home to Arsenal. \nA bookmaker, who sponsored Sutton for the tie, offered odds of 8-1 for 45-year-old Shaw to tuck in to something during the game - a factor he later admitted he was aware of. \nThe incident subsequently came under investigation by the Gambling Commission, while the Football Association was also reportedly set to look into the matter, prompting Shaw to step aside. Man of the day? @suttonunited 's Simon Downer. Defender played in goal for 75 mins after GK got injured and won 2-3 at Torquay!! üëè \n‚Äî Adam Summerton (@adamsummerton) February 25, 2017 We think so üëç https://t.co/Rzi6P59K5v \n‚Äî Sutton United FC (@suttonunited) February 25, 2017 \n\nThough the rotund shot-stopper's best years are perhaps behind him, his services would have come in handy when first-choice Ross Worner was forced off with injury just 15 minutes into Saturday's fixture at Torquay United, just after conceding the opening goal. \nSutton right-back Simon Downer donned the gloves. \nWhat odds of a fairytale return for Shaw if Worner cannot play the next game... So Wayne Shaw, who slept on a sofa 3 nights a week at Sutton to maintain and run the place loses his job over #piegate .
