'Thin air' \nThe council is undertaking comparative research with other cities, including the team behind the Klyde Warren Park in central Dallas. \nThe park, described by on its website as green space made \"out of thin air\", was opened in 2012 and covers the Rogers Woodall Freeway. \nA final decision on the M8 proposal is expected to be made in the summer of 2018. \nGlasgow City Council leader Frank McAveety, said: \"This is a truly inspiring project, but also one that is complex as it is ambitious. \n\"We must get the groundwork right and take time to create something that benefits the city while delivering a new public space that attracts and connects people and places. \n\"Coupled with the other projects coming forward as part of the Sauchiehall and Garnethill regeneration project will ensure that we make this a prominent place in the city's life.\" \nDesign company Keppie produced the picture to show how the public space over the M8 could look. \nA council spokesman said the image was just indicative, and the planned location of the park was closer to the top of Bath Street in front of Tay House.
