The DeKalb County School District confirmed that the fundraiser is for the students, though it wasn’t created by the district.\nMiller Grove is a Title I school, where many students’ families struggle financially. Some kids find solace and purpose in music.\n“Our band program is quite unique. It is not just a class or extracurricular activity,” the fundraiser page said. “It's the joy, the life, and a safe haven for the students. It is a place where they can express themselves in one of the most beautiful art forms.”\nEach student needs at least $750 to participate in the trip.\nBy Tuesday afternoon, only $2,585 of the $10,000 goal had been raised.\nREALTED: DeKalb MIT student is on ‘Jeopardy!’\nRELATED: 14 DeKalb schools ranked among best in Georgia for student success\nRELATED: Even with teacher certification waivers, DeKalb Schools struggles with vacancies\nLike DeKalb County News Now on Facebook | Follow on Twitter and Instagram", "external_links": ["https://www.instagram.com/dekalbnewsnow/", "https://www.gofundme.com/MGHSWindsymphony", "https://twitter.com/DeKalbNewsNow", "https://www.facebook.com/dekalbnewsnow/"], "published": "2017-02-14T22:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T00:41:18.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
