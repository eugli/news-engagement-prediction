President Donald Trump, the reality TV star turned commander-in-chief, stepped out before a national television audience on Tuesday to choose Judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to the Supreme Court—the winner of a monthslong selection process that started with a list of 21 contenders. \n \n“Was that a surprise? Was it?” the president said as he invited Gorsuch and his wife to enter the East Room of the White House through a side door where they’d remained hidden until the climactic reveal.\nGorsuch is a predictable, logical pick for Trump, who won over a large portion of his conservative base with his pledge to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia with a jurist of similar pedigree. The White House hopes the nomination — the announcement was moved up two days — will be a rallying point for rank-and-file Republicans, who have been critical or leery of the administration’s chaotic first two weeks. \nIn the lead-up, Trump amped up the drama of the choice by keeping his selection process and ultimate choice a closely held secret. \n\nTrump picks Gorsuch for Supreme Court By Shane Goldmacher , Josh Gerstein and Matthew Nussbaum \nBehind the scenes, Trump settled on Gorsuch after only a single in-person interview in Trump Tower. Gorsuch was ushered into the building through a back door on Jan. 14 so he wouldn’t be seen by the press gathered in the lobby. \n“I don’t think you’ll find any person in this room that was not impressed with how he went about it. One, his selection process…who he selected and how he rolled it out tonight,” said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in an interview after the announcement.\nTrump personally interviewed four Supreme Court finalists, three at his home in New York before he moved to the White House, according to two people involved in the search. The others were Judge Thomas Hardiman, who sits on the Third Circuit with Trump’s sister, Judge Maryanne Trump Barry; 11th Circuit Court Judge Bill Pryor; and Judge Amul Thupar, who sits on the U.S. District Court for Eastern District of Kentucky. \nOnly one other person was in the room during Trump’s full interviews with the finalists: White House Counsel Don McGahn, the two officials said. And Trump only met with each of the finalists once before deciding, although he did later speak with some by phone. Trump’s top lieutenants — Vice President Mike Pence, McGahn, chief of staff Reince Priebus, and chief strategist Stephen Bannon — also had their own interviews with the four finalists, along with several other candidates in New York.\nOn The Bench \nTrump Picks Scalia 2.0 By Richard Primus \nTrump called Gorsuch on Monday to tell him he was the nominee, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, and Gorsuch was whisked to D.C. that night.\nPrior to the interviews, Trump had largely outsourced the search process to others. In an unprecedented move, Trump rolled out a list of 21 potential judges during the campaign, a list put together by conservatives at the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. \nBut even if Trump himself was initially removed, his allies say he was keenly aware of how important his final choice is to his presidency. \n“If Trump is going to be a transformational president, not a transitional president, he needs a supportive court,” said Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser. “Not a conservative court, not a right-wing court — a Trump court. A court that is populist right. Because the court is going to challenge Trump in a dozen areas.”\nFrom the beginning, this Supreme Court search wasn’t just about filling the seat once held by Scalia. Trump’s team was also intent on signaling to 80-year-old Justice Anthony Kennedy that, should he choose to retire during Trump’s term, the president would fill it with a respected jurist. \nHaving the initial list of 21 candidates proved both constraining and liberating for Trump. He knew he risked a backlash from movement conservatives if he strayed from it, and quickly discarded the notion after winning the election, according to people involved in the search. But he was free to choose whoever he liked best within the pool, knowing any of them would be supported by established conservative advocacy groups whose support he’ll need to win a tough Senate confirmation battle. \n\nNeil Gorsuch is Trump's SCOTUS nominee. Background, bio, facts and political views By Josh Gerstein \nThe idea of publicizing a list of candidates first emerged last March, when Trump met with about two dozen congressional Republicans at McGahn’s Washington, D.C. law firm, Jones Day. Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society, who counseled Trump on his search throughout, attended, too, and he and Trump kicked the idea of a list around during the meeting, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. Trump publicized an initial list two months later, then added additional names to it in September, including Gorsuch, who was not on the initial list.\nInternally, Pryor had been seen as an early frontrunner in part because of a prominent backer: Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump’s attorney general nominee, for whom Pryor once served as deputy attorney general in Alabama years ago. But Pryor — who once called Roe v. Wade “the worst abomination of constitutional law” — encountered some surprising resistance among evangelical leaders, a group that advisers said Trump was determined to please from the start.\n“The person that I pick will be a big, big — I think people are going to love it. I think evangelicals, Christians will love my pick and will be represented very fairly,” Trump told the Christian Broadcasting Network last Friday.\nAt the White House announcement, Trump noted that “millions of voters said this was the single most important issue to them.” A Trump adviser said that in private, president can quote the exit polls showing it: “I can tell you for a fact that he knows that exit poll data.”\nBut Trump, who only embraced social conservatism during his presidential campaign, doesn’t care for some of the legal fights conservatives and evangelicals are most excited to bring before the Court. “He is definitely not interested in any effort to overturn gay marriage,” said another person Trump consulted during the search process. Notably, the White House announced the same day as Gorsuch announcement that Trump would enforce an Obama-era executive order “protecting the rights of the LGBTQ community.”\n\nGorsuch pick affirms Trump vow to pick 'pro-life' justice By Jennifer Haberkorn \nAs the inauguration neared, Hardiman was the last man standing between Gorsuch and the Supreme Court. Both had been approved for the federal appeals court without recorded dissent — a key factor for Trump’s team. Hardiman’s supporters included Trump’s sister, and they tried to sell Trump on his blue-collar credentials.\nBut Trump ultimately settled on the Harvard-educated Gorsuch, whose elegant writing — “standing here in a house of history, and accurately aware of my own imperfections,” Gorsuch said while accepting the nomination — has some hailing him as Scalia 2.0 .\nTrump’s own introduction of Gorsuch was lacking in any real description of the nominee’s judicial views or outlook. Instead, there were the usual Trump superlatives. “It is an extraordinary resume,” Trump declared. “As good as it gets.”\nGorsuch, in his own remarks, paid subtle homage to the man he’s now slated to replace, paraphrasing an old Scalia line: “A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge.”\nTrump, who likes to like every outcome, seemed pleased with the whole show. After Gorsuch spoke, two men locked hands and eyes. They walked off stage together, a president and his chosen Supreme Court nominee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-01-31T18:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T06:51:08.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
