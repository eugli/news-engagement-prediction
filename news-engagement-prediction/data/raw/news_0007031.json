No prizes for guessing that it's her very own daughter Nysa .\nKaran Johar and Kajol: A friendship that could not pass the test of time! The basic reason of this fallout is Kajol’s support for her husband, Ajay Devgn during the release of his film ‘Shivaay’. The equation between Kajol and Karan got into friction mode with the clash in the release date of Karan’s ‘Ae Dil Hai Mushkil’ and Ajay Devgn’s movie ‘Shivaay’.\nIf you follow Kajol and Nysa on social media, you'll know that the mother-daughter duo constantly indulges in fun banter. Something similar happened recently when Kajol shared a picture of herself on Instagram, with the caption reading, \"when I see my babies together @nysaadevgan\". The actress' daughter had a hilarious reaction to this post. Nysa simply commented, \"Mo , why do you have to be so extra\". Wonder what mommy Kajol has to say to this.\nwhen I see my babies together @nysaadevgan\nA photo posted by Kajol Devgan (@kajol) on Jan 30, 2017 at 8:27am PST", "external_links": ["https://www.missmalini.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/a-6.jpg", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BP5SuiJhI23/"], "published": "2017-02-01T09:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T10:01:44.053+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
