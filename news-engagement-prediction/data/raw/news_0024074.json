On a public train. In New York City. In 2017.\" \nHe said everything changed when one man stood up and called on others to remove the graffiti. \n\"One guy got up and said, 'Hand sanitizer gets rid of Sharpie. We need alcohol.' He found some tissues and got to work.\" \n\"I've never seen so many people simultaneously reach into their bags and pockets looking for tissues and Purel [hand sanitiser],\" Mr Locke said. \nHe added that within minutes they had cleaned off all the symbols. \n\"'I guess this is Trump's America,' said one passenger. No sir, it's not. Not tonight and not ever. Not as long as stubborn New Yorkers have anything to say about it.\" \nMr Locke's story has been shared across social media more than 368,000 times by Monday, with many praising those involved for taking action. \nHilary Clinton's daughter Chelsea weighed in on the discussion as well, sharing the post to Twitter. \n\"We will not let hate win. And, another reason carry sanitizer,\" she said. \nHowever, there has been some backlash to Mr Locke's comments regarding President Donald Trump's links to the vandalism. \n\"It takes a twisted mind to see this kind of hatred then stir up hatred on all trump supporters,\" Steven Davis wrote on Facebook. \n\"Are you for real? Trump and the Republicans (and honestly, one of the only good things to come from them), have been fighting for Israel from the beginning,\" Laurin Privateer wrote. \n\"As disgusting as this is to see, and as badly as you want to point the finger to whom you deem as evil, the finger is pointing the wrong way.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T07:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T03:26:13.646+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
