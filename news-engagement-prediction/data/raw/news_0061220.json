What is going on there - totally out of control. Chicago needs help!\" \nThrough Wednesday, the Police Department counted 91 homicides, just two less than during the same period last year. But Tribune data — which include expressway killings and fatal shootings by police as well as those ruled justified by police — put homicides at 99, up from 97. \nEven by the department's own numbers, shooting incidents have risen to 379 through Wednesday, up slightly from 365 a year earlier. \nFriday's announcement of the 81 people arrested — 79 on felony charges — over the past two days was part of an effort by the Police Department to tamp down violence in the city's most dangerous neighborhoods. Nineteen had past weapons charges and 14 were on parole, according to the officials.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T08:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T03:37:03.661+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
