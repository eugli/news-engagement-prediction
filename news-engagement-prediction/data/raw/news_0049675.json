Puppy\" and \"Bunsen is a Beast\" collide in a brand new short: \"The Fairly Odd Phantom.\" Tracy Brown \nThe veteran creator made this short to commemorate the premiere of his fourth Nickelodeon show “Bunsen is a Beast.” His first series for the network, “The Fairly Oddparents,” premiered in 2001 and is currently in its 10th season. \nHartman’s latest series follows the adventures of Bunsen, the first beast to attend a human school, as he learns to tackle normal human tasks like doing homework and riding the bus to prove that beasts can live along side humans. \nHelping Bunsen is his best friend Mikey, a human who will in turn be learning all about the various beasts from the Beast World. \n“Bunsen is one of the best things I've been able to do. I'm so excited about it,” said Hartman. “Not only because of the awesome characters but because of the incredible writing our team is doing. I think it combines the best traits of all my previous stuff and even adds a bit of extra weirdness here and there, too.” \n“I'm super-excited for kids to discover the cool things about the world of beasts,” said Hartman. \n“Bunsen is a Beast” premieres Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Caption Kenneth Turan and Justin Chang talk about the Oscars \nKenneth Turan and Justin Chang chat about the 2017 Academy Awards, and which movie might win for best picture. \nKenneth Turan and Justin Chang chat about the 2017 Academy Awards, and which movie might win for best picture.
