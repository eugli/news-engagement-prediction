The European Union provides DFQF access to all the LDCs under an arrangement called ‘Everything But Arms’ (EBA),\" he was quoted as saying. \nHe also briefed the Senator on various development activities of the Bangladesh government, including counter terrorism cooperation, women empowerment and relations with neighbouring countries. \nHe highlighted the fact that more than four million garment workers of Bangladesh were women contributing to the economy as well as to society by alleviating poverty and containing the menace of terrorism. \n\"Therefore, he pointed out that if the Bangladesh economy could grow further with the help of US market access, then there would be more women empowerment and societal change by which Bangladesh could control and ultimately eliminate the roots of terrorism and violent extremism with its own resources\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T04:35:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:06:23.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
