Veteran referee “Big” John McCarthy secured refereeing duties for the night’s main event, which sees UFC welterweight champion Tyron Woodley attempt to defend his belt in a grudge match against Stephen “Wonderboy” Thompson . Nevada regulars Sal D'Amato, Chris Lee, and Derek Cleary were selected to judge the contest, which serves as a rematch of a Nov. 2016 bout that ended in a majority draw. Notably, Cleary was one of two judges that scored the first Woodley-Thompson match a 47-47 draw. Fellow veteran referee Herb Dean was chosen by the NAC to oversee the night’s co-headlining bout, an interim lightweight title match between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson . The judges in that contest will be Marcos Rosales, Junichiro Kamijo, and Jeff Mullen. UFC 209 takes place March 4 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. The card also features bouts between Alistair Overeem vs. Mark Hunt , Mirsad Bektic vs. Darren Elkins , Rashad Evans vs. Daniel Kelly , and Lando Vannata vs. David Teymur , among others.
