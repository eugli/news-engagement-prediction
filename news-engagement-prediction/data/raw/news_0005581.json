My king.” A photo posted by Dominic Monaghan (@dom_monaghan_) on Jan 30, 2017 at 8:05pm PST A photo posted by Dominic Monaghan (@dom_monaghan_) on Jan 30, 2017 at 8:06pm PST \nBoyd joked about Wood’s hat being made from “Mithril” – a fictional metal used to make effective lightweight armour. \nHe tweeted: “Elijah was thinking ahead and of his head....he wore a Mithril hat!
