Thirty-one employees have been let go,” a statement to Global News from St. Michael’s Hospital said Tuesday. Story continues below \n“The hospital takes its role as custodian of the public trust very seriously. St. Michael’s has a strict policy for its health benefits plan. We are continuing to work with SunLife, our benefits administrator, to ensure a thorough investigation.” \nThe statement said hospital officials won’t be releasing further information “to maintain the integrity of (the) review.” \nGlobal News obtained a copy of a memo from Mary Madigan-Lee, vice president of human resources for St. Michael’s Hospital, that was sent to employees. It said “necessary measures have been taken with the employees involved.” \n“Our benefits are offered to all eligible employees to increase you and your families’ health and well-being. Together we need to use these benefits respectfully.” \nThe memo also referenced the hospital’s whistleblower policy “which is in place to allow staff, physicians and third-parties to raise an issue.” \nSean O’Shea contributed to this report. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
