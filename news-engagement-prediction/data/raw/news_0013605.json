Just like it had happened same time last year, Rupee reversed all of its pre-Budget weakness.(Reuters) Rupee did an encore against USD this year post Budget. Just like it had happened same time last year, Rupee reversed all of its pre-Budget weakness. Dollar/Rupee swooned as exporters and speculators joined in to hammer the USD lower. Pair closed the around 67.15 levels on spot in NDF. There was not much expectation surrounding the Union Budget. The best part Indian government did not announce anything to adversely affect the mood of the financial markets. In fact on a whole the Budget appeared more focused and prudent. Government proposed a 7% increase in overall expenditure, with an 11% increase in capital spending and 10% increase in spending in rural areas. Tax revenues are projected to grow 13% in FY18 as against a growth of 17% and 12% over FY16 and FY17. Government also made a beginning towards a simplified and low tax regime. They have reduced the tax rate for MSMEs from 30% to 25% and also offered a 500 basis point relief to folks earning below INR 5 lakh per annum. A lot of measures have been and also will be taken to augment the tax compliance in the nation.\nGST in itself will give a boost towards a more a formal economy. However, it will come at a cost as GST should not be seen as merely a tax reform but a reset in the way business is conducted in India. There will be loss of business and also unemployment during the transition towards a more formal economy. However, the medium to long term path appears promising. A formal economy will be efficient as cost of capital will come down and government revenues will be augmented. Indiaâ€™s consolidated fiscal deficit is still one of the highest in the world at 6%. Over the past 9 years, it has been hovering between 6%-8%. Government has emphasised on a need for a more targeting of expenditure so that less of it is wasted. All in all, we expect the Union Budget to be received positively by financial markets. Over the month of January Indian Rupee has been a laggard in the EM basket. However, past couple of days of strength has been about a catch up to its peers. However, how far it will strengthen relative to its peers would depend on RBI . RBI has been accumulating USD since the New Year and we expect them to utilise the decline in US Dollar to shore up its reserves further. As a result, we expect Rupee to remain a below average performer in the EM basket for Q1.\n :", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T04:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T00:11:05.816+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
