Carmelo Anthony (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:37 a.m. ET \nUpdated at 8:37 a.m. ET \nCarmelo Anthony could be asked to serve as a replacement for Kevin Love in the All-Star game, but it doesn't sound like he really wants to. \n\"I got plans,\" he said, via ESPN , about filling in for the injured Love. \"I would love to take this break and just utilize this break and my body and my mind and just get away from everything. I could utilize this break. If they call me I'd consider it. But I would love to utilize this break.\" \nMORE: Spike Lee criticizes James Dolan while wearing Charles Oakley jersey \nAnthony really could use a break considering everything he's been put through. The Knicks aren't great, the team president is openly criticizing him and, oh yeah, he's also in the middle of several trade rumors. \nThrough all of it, he's kept his composure and has taken the high road on everything. So a little trip away from basketball is probably something he's been looking foward to. \nAs for Love, some other replacement options include Joel Embiid (although he has his own injury), Melo's teammate Kristaps Porzingis or potentially the Wizards' Bradley Beal.
