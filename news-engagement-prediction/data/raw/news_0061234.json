I like all of them. However, I think Shah Rukh Khan has an unmatchable energy. Whatever role or scene he does, he puts liveliness to it. I love that,\" he said. \n\nThe new-kid-on-the-block was speaking at the launch of the trailer of his debut film \"Machine\" on Thursday. The movie is directed by Abbas-Mustan. \n\nWas it a conscious decision to work with father and uncle? \n\n\"When we were working on the script, I liked the script very much. I wished I could do the film but could not tell them. But yes that was my wish,\" he replied. \n\n\"I was assisting them in the direction (Abbas-Mustan) and whenever I had to narrate the scene to the actors I used to act. Gradually I started liking acting too. I can play a role in different ways,\" he said. \n\nWhat your reaction was after getting selected for the film? \n\n\"I was shocked because they called me randomly. They said the writers are not there so come and enact the script. When I was enacting they looked at me and said that I am doing this film. I was shocked but overjoyed.\" \n\n\"The role is very challenging and the script is unusual,\" he added. \n\nThe romantic thriller, which also stars Kiara Advani, is slated to release on March 17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T22:58:50.916+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
