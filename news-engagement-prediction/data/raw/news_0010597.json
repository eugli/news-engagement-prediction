One of her performances was in Gauri Shinde ‘s Dear Zindagi for which won all the hearts of critics and audience. The film was a heart-warming take on life through young girl’s eyes. \nAlia Bhatt’s character Kyra is a successful woman who is struggling with her love life and dealing with depression. A couple of deleted scenes have been released which leave you wanting for more. In a new deleted scene, Alia’s character tries casual dating after several heartbreaks. She meets a guy for coffee who turns out to be extremely weird. Amidst the conversation, the guy sneezes and calls it allergies which he gets every day at 4:30 pm. Kyra has this ‘Why am I here?’ moment right after hearing that. After the date, she calls one of her friends ranting about how she regrets wasting two hours of her life. Clearly, people could have related to this scene if it had made the cut as most of the time first dates turn out to be awkward and weird. \nDear Zindagi also starred Shah Rukh Khan , Alia Bhatt’s therapist, who taught her to live her life again. Besides this, Alia Bhatt is gearing for the release of her next film Badrinath Ki Dulhania alongside Varun Dhawan . It is slated to release on March 10.
