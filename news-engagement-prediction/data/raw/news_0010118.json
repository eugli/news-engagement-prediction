President Rodrigo Duterte arrives at the State Dining Room of the Malacañang Palace for a Cabinet Meeting on January 23, 2017. File photo by Richard Madelo/Presidential Photo \nMANILA, Philippines – President Rodrigo Duterte approved a proposal to bring back mandatory Reserved Officers Training Course (ROTC) for Grades 11 and 12 and will certify as urgent a bill to revive it. \nAgriculture Secretary Manny Piñol said this was one of the decisions made during the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, February 7. \n\"President Rody Duterte has approved the return of the Reserved Officers Training Course in Grades 11 and 12 of the country's public and private schools,\" Piñol said in a Facebook post. \n\"This will now be forwarded to Congress and Senate and certified as urgent by President Duterte,\" he added. \nPresidential Spokesman Ernesto Abella confirmed this to Malacañang reporters. \nThe President and Cabinet members discussed the proposal after Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana proposed amendments to Republic Act No 7077 or the Citizen Armed Forces of the Philippines Reservist Act. \n\"Lorenzana said ROTC instills patriotism, love of country, moral and spiritual values, respect for human rights, and adherence to Constitution,\" recalled Piñol. \nPreviously, ROTC was implemented at the college level. It was abolished in 2002 after an investigation showed that a University of Santo Tomas student was murdered after he exposed alleged corruption in the ROTC.
