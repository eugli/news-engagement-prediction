He will not be allowed to work with minors while on probation.\nCammon had already been fired from his position.\nThe boy’s grandmother, Tracy Davis, said she wasn’t happy with the sentence but understood the judge was limited since Cammon was charged with a misdemeanor.\n“He’s gonna do five days in jail and after that my grandson still has to go on,” she told Channel 2.\nDavis said her grandson has nightmares about the incident.\n“He doesn’t trust people,” she said. “He’s angry (and) wants to fight all the time, and I feel helpless.”\nCammon’s attorney said it was an accident, according to the news station.\n“Sometimes clients decide they just want to put it behind them and that’s what he wanted to do,” Jackie Patterson said.\nIn court, Cammon apologized to the victim and his family, saying: “I’m not that person. I’ve always loved kids.”\nChannel 2 said Cammon is scheduled to turn himself in Feb. 17.\nA teacher and another paraprofessional were also arrested in the incident, but a judge ruled there was not enough evidence to charge them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T02:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T09:56:04.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
