Alexa can tell jokes, read books, teach math -- the list goes on and it’s expanding regularly. \nTo unlock Alexa’s full potential, check out everything the voice assistant can do. 1 / 15 Jacob Ammentorp Lund | Getty Images Make a to-do list. \nLose the pen and paper (or tablet or smartphone) -- you now have your own personal notetaker. \nAlexa can help you draft your to do or shopping lists. Just let it know what you need -- “Amazon, add ‘go to the grocery story’ to my to-do list.” \nIn fact, Alexa can basically act as a personal assistant. It can keep your calendar in order and let you know of any upcoming events or appointments. Just ask, “Alexa, what’s on my calendar for tomorrow?” 2 / 15 Takeshi Kitagawa | EyeEm | Getty Images Check the weather forecast. \nBefore you even get out of bed to start getting ready for the day, find out what the weather’s like outside. Do you need an umbrella? Alexa has the answer. Ask, “Alexa, will I need an umbrella today?” \nIf you’re planning ahead, find out from Alexa what this weekend's weather looks like -- “Alexa, what’s the weather going to be this weekend?” 3 / 15 Nycretoucher | Getty Images Check for traffic. \nLike the weather, it’s important to be prepared for anything before you head out for the day. Alexa can let you know what the traffic looks like on your morning commute -- “Alexa, what’s my commute look like?” Or, “Alexa, what’s traffic like?” Westend61 | Getty Images Read the news. \nMany of us have already (sadly) ditched the newspaper, but here's another way to get the news without reaching for your smartphone. \nWhile you’re brushing your teeth or making breakfast, Alexa can give you a morning briefing. Just ask, “Alexa, what’s in the news?” 5 / 15 Do some research. \nThere’s a lot that Alexa can teach you. \nSay you’re thinking about watching a movie but want to find out more before you dedicate your time. Alexa can tell you what the IMDb rating is for a movie, what actors are in it and basically anything else you want to know. You can ask things such as, “Alexa, who plays in the [name of movie]?” Or “Alexa, what is [actor]’s latest movie?” \nIf you’re curious about any music or artist you’re listening too, that’s also a question for Alexa. To find out who sings a particular song -- “Alexa, who sings the song [title]?\" If you want a scoop on an album -- “Alexa, \"What year did [band] release [song or album]?\" \nAlexa can also look up anything online for you. You can ask it to look up something on Wikipedia, or you can ask something such as, “Alexa, how tall is Michael Jordan?” 6 / 15 Guido Mieth | Getty Images Do calculations. With the help of Alexa, you’ll never need a calculator again. From basic math to advanced algebra, Alexa is a math wiz. You can ask it a simple conversion question such as, “Alexa, how many cups are in a quart?” Or, ask something trickier such as, “Alexa, 70 factorial.” 7 / 15 PeopleImages | Getty Images Shop. \nOnce you hook up your Amazon account to Alexa, you can use it to make sure you never run out of anything. From groceries to toiletries to music, Alexa can order all of your necessities with your voice. Out of toilet paper? Not a problem -- “Alexa, buy more toilet paper.” \nIf you want to know about Amazon's daily deals, Alexa will tell you. Just ask, “Alexa, what are your deals?” \nAfter Alexa places your order, it’ll also help you track it: “Alexa, where’s my stuff?” 8 / 15 Rawpixel | Getty Images Find restaurants. Don’t know where to go out for dinner? Ask Alexa, it will tell you what’s around. You can ask questions such as, “Alexa, what Mexican restaurants are nearby?” or “Alexa, what are some top-rated Indian restaurants?” Whatever you’re craving -- it’ll have an answer. 9 / 15 Victor J. Blue | Bloomberg | Getty Images Request an Uber. If requesting an Uber wasn’t simple enough already -- open the app, add your location and request a car -- it’s even easier now. With Alexa, you can request an Uber simply with your voice. “Alexa, ask Uber to request a ride.” You can then ask, “Alexa, ask Uber where’s my ride?” 10 / 15 Hero Images | Getty Images Find a recipe. If you’re unsure what to cook for dinner, Alexa has a library of recipes to choose from, courtesy of The Food Network. Simply ask, “Alexa, ask Food Network for recipes on TV right now.” 11 / 15 Order a pizza. \nOops -- you burned dinner, now what? Order a pizza. \nYou’ll have to have a Domino’s “Pizza Profile” already set up to do this. Just enter your name, address and payment info and add in your “Easy Order” preference, and you’ll never have to lift a finger to order a pizza again. \nAfter you’ve got your Domino’s profile ready, you can start asking Alexa, “Alexa, open Domino’s and place my Easy Order.” After you’ve ordered it, you can have Alexa check on its status too -- “Alexa, ask Domino’s to track my order.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T16:12:37.678+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
