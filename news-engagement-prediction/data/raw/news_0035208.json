But the fact is we need to grow at some point faster than we are now,” he said. “I think 7.5% growth rate is not something to be disappointed about.” \nThe six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) headed by Patel had last week kept interest rates unchanged at 6.25% for the second straight meeting and changed policy stance to ‘neutral’ from ‘accommodative’. \nThe change in stance, he said, gives more flexibility to cut, raise or hold rates as compared with an accommodative one on inflation outlook. \n“The best way that central bank can support growth on a durable basis is to ensure inflation is low, stable, there is financial stability and that is the role the central bank plays. Very few countries grow at high growth rate if inflation is high and volatile. So, I think we are doing our bit to support higher growth rate, but on a durable basis,” he said. \nThe RBI Governor expressed concern over the US moving towards protectionism under Trump. \n“I think it is a cause of concern for the world, I think it is a cause of concern for the emerging markets in terms of creating financial volatility. I don’t think anyone will be safeguarded from it. We have to manage this as it plays out,” he said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:59.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
