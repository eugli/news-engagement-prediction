He had one advice. \"When you call him, ask him straight away, 'Are you Ishaq Ahmed '?'' True to his hunch, the man when asked the question insisted that he was the real Ishaq and that he was driving Rawat's car on that fateful day. Also that he was the one to go to court and surrender, an offence for which he promptly got bail. The new Ishaq told TOI, \"I was driving the Audi of Rawat that night. I haven't done anything wrong and the accident took place due to the fault of the auto-rickshaw driver. You should ask further questions to him.\" Told that the auto driver was one of the four who died in the accident, he said, \"It was his mistake in any case and I had no enmity with him. I have experience of driving big cars and no case has been lodged against me in the past. I am tired of giving explanations to everyone. I have known Rawat since long and had also driven his vehicle when he was working at a hospital in Bareilly.\" Curiously, he too claimed, like the other Ishaq, that Jameel Ahmed, a farmer who resides in Labheda village under Hafizganj police station in Bareilly, was his father. Asked why his parents were claiming that their son was in Gujarat at the time of the incident, the new Ishaq said, \"I had not informed them as that would have scared them.\" He then added that it was the other Ishaq, \"whose real name is Iftiyar Ahmed\", who is impersonating him. In the meantime, the photo of the man who claimed to be Ishaq Ahmed in court - which has appeared in some websites -- doesn't match that of the man TOI spoke to from Lalbheda. Standing in front of his truck somewhere in Assam, he is much younger, about 32, as he claimed on Friday. This came even as the two persons who had given sureties on behalf of Ishaq Ahmed at the chief judicial magistrate's court in Ghaziabad were identified on Saturday. One of them, Brajesh Singh, is a resident of Olive County Apartment in Vasundhara, Ghaziabad. The other, Suraj Tiwary, is from Bareilly. They both claimed that they knew \"driver Ishaq\" and that the sureties were given when they were approached for it. \"I know Ishaq Ahmed, who is the driver of Dr Manish Rawat with whom I am acquainted with,\" said Singh, who lives in flat number 501, Tower number C-4, Olive County. In the supporting document Singh had given in the CJM court, the address, however, is \"Flat number 702, C-1 tower, Olive County Apartment\". Tiwary, a \"bank manager\" in Barielly , also said he knew Ishaq Ahmed. But here, too, there were anomalies. While he had claimed he was an officer with \"Prathama Bank\" in Bareilly, there is no such bank anywhere in the city. The website of the bank says they have branches in Moradabad, Rampur, Sambhal and JP Nagar. SSP, Bareilly, Jogendra Kumar said, \"I am not aware if the Ghaziabad police conducted a verification of the identity papers the man claiming to be Ishaq Ahmed gave in court. If the real Ishaq approaches us saying someone has misused his documents and taken blame in the Audi-auto accident, we will lodge an FIR in Bareilly.\" Jameel Ahmed, who received a notice on Saturday from the Ghaziabad police asking his truck-driver son to appear in the Indirapuram police station to record his statement, said, \"We are god fearing people. God is watching everything.\" (With inputs from Abhijay Jha) Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.
