He’s also working on getting even more mileage out of his biggest song with a new musical entitled “Escape to Margaritaville,” slated to open in May in California. \nThis year also marks the 40th anniversary for his album “Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes.” Dancing aunts and uncles at weddings everywhere presumably thank him. \nFruitcakes can catch Buffett on May 13.
