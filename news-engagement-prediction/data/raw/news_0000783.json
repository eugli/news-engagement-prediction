Tennessee junior quarterback Quinten Dormady (Photo: Icon Sportswire, Getty) \nScott said all four players are fired up for the opportunity and fired up to work with new quarterbacks coach Mike Canales , because a new position coach means a fresh start for everyone. \n(Buy one month of GoVols247 VIP access and GET TWO MONTHS FREE .) \n“All those guys are excited about it,” said Scott, who served as Tennessee’s tight ends coach last season. “They’re gonna get a chance to work with Coach Canales. It’s gonna be a unique experience, because it’s not [a situation] where those guys are gonna come out and they’ve had a coach there that’s gonna already have a formulated opinion on ‘em. It’s gonna be truly wide open, and he’s gonna be working with them on a daily basis both mentally and physically, him learning them, them learning him and all those types of things. \n“It’s gonna be fascinating to watch it all come together. It’s exciting for young college football players.” \n\nContact Wes Rucker by email at wesrucker247@gmail.com or ON TWITTER , or FOLLOW GOVOLS247 ON FACEBOOK .
