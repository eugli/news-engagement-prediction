I think that’s one possibility.” \nThe report said that Podesta did not offer any specific evidence to advance the argument, but Democrats have not been shy in the past to criticized FBI Director James Comey’s decision to—11 days before the election—alert Congress about the agency looking into additional emails. \n“He (Comey) made a bad judgment, and I think virtually anybody who had opined on the topic…have said it was a terrible mistake of judgment.” \nPodesta has not been shy about assigning blame for the election loss. In December, he said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was indeed “personally involved” in the election email hacks because Russia wanted Donald Trump as its “lap dog” in the White House.
