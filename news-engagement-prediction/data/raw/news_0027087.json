All three lived in Neptune City and were pals, with Taylor even taking Stern to the junior prom. \nProsecutors say that Taylor confessed to dumping Sarah Stern's body after McAtasney strangled her. \nMcAtasney called Taylor after he killed Stern and asked him to hide her body, according to prosecutors.

They then met at a bridge in Belmar and the two threw her body into the river, according to prosecutor Meghan Doyle said. Stern's body has not yet been found.
