With two 4K OLED ranges and a brand new three-strong LCD 4K HDR line-up, plus HLG support throughout, there's a lot of TV tech crammed into the 2017 Panasonic TV line-up... CES 2017 was purely a flagship affair for Panasonic’s TV announcements – a big, headline event for its big, headline TV. That TV was the Panasonic EZ1002 OLED TV, Panasonic’s second-generation OLED set, and a flatscreen panel to follow on from last year’s curved (and hugely expensive) TX-65CZ952B. The only model announced at CES was a 65in version - the TX-65EZ1002 - but a second 77in screen has been revealed at Panasonic's European Convention. That's not all: there's a second OLED range, the EZ952 , in 55in and 65in sizes, with a rumoured price of €2499 for the TX-55EZ952. Panasonic has also revealed a new LCD line-up with three 4K HDR ranges and two Full HD/HD Ready series for 2017. MORE: Panasonic, Technics CES 2017 highlights All 4K TVs are equipped with an improved My Home Screen 2.0 interface, which takes on the colourful Firefox OS's design and includes new features such as a favourites folders for multiple users, a customisable My App button on the remote, and a revamped Media Player app that supports 4K HDR10 and Hybrid Log Gamma (HLG) . HLG support will be available straight out the box for all 2017 4K TVs, but there'll be no support for Dolby Vision HDR for Panasonic's 2017 TVs, or indeed the forthcoming Advanced HDR by Technicolour. There's also a new version of Freeview Play, which Panasonic has refreshed with a Quick Look Guide that shows past, present and future shows for a particular channel, and live thumbnails that show what's being broadcast on other channels. 4K HDR streaming from Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube are all promised to be on board, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T05:06:17.341+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
