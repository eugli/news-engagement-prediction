That grant was divided between I, Daniel Blake and The Flickering Flame. The latter is ‘an interactive documentary’ that explores the ‘uncompromising films’ of one Kenneth Charles Loach. And that’s a telling detail. Our Ken does a lovely self-deprecating chuckle when he’s being hosed down with flattery by The Guardian or the BBC. But he has an ego the size of one of those council tower blocks where he sets some of his films (but chooses not to live). For example, there used to be a National Lottery-funded initiative called the New Cinema Fund, which was intended to identify fresh talent from British film-makers, among other objectives. Loach, then in his late 60s, used money from the fund to make The Wind That Shakes The Barley — a film set in Twenties Ireland that glorified the IRA and depicted the British as murderous thugs. It was powerful stuff — expertly crafted, like most of Loach’s films. First big hit: David Bradley in Ken Loach's 1969 film 'Kes', about a schoolboy and his pet kestrel The problem is that the craft goes into selling us a Marxist fairytale — whether the backdrop is the Spanish civil war (Land And Freedom) or Nicaragua (Carla’s Song, in which, God help us, a Glaswegian bus driver joins the Left-wing rebels the Sandinistas). The Wind That Shakes The Barley earned Loach his first Palme d’Or at Cannes in 2006. The then creative industries minister, James Purnell, was thrilled that Lottery money had helped pay for the triumph. The fact that Loach had used the opportunity to distort our national history didn’t seem to bother him. And presumably Mr Purnell — later culture secretary and now head of radio at the BBC — is equally untroubled by the caricatures and implausibilities of I, Daniel Blake. Incidentally, one of the funders of the new film was BBC Films, whose head, Christine Langan, says she is ‘honoured’ by the association. You would never guess from Christine’s tributes to ‘one of our most humane film-makers’ that his obsession with ‘cultural boycotts’ of Israel verges on the sinister. Ken Loach makes no secret of the fact that he wants to sell Marxism to the public: after falling out with Labour, he was associated with several far-Left political groups. They included George Galloway’s hard-Left Respect party, whose members were encouraged to attend screenings of The Wind That Shakes The Barley. But do the public buy into his fantasies? Loach (pictured) made a political speech while accepting his award on Sunday night On the whole, no — if you measure their support in terms of the cinema box office. Loach’s first big hit, Kes, a drama about a Yorkshire boy and his kestrel, did capture imaginations and was enjoyed by viewers of all backgrounds. But that was in 1969. Many people may well also have enjoyed the television adverts for Tennent’s Lager that Loach made in the Eighties — but he doesn’t often talk about them and they are hard to track down. Otherwise, he has been preaching to the converted, who range from the canapé-gobbling chattering classes to fellow delusional hard-Leftists such as Jeremy Corbyn. Last year, Loach made a one-hour promotional video for his old friend, the Labour leader. It was gruesomely sycophantic: the director’s first, unintentional, comic classic. None of this would matter very much if the money for Loach’s films was provided only by his chin-stroking, jargon-spouting admirers. But why should the public help foot the bill? He talks about the ‘rich, varied’ lives that working-class people live, cooing over them like David Attenborough observing rare and endangered wildlife. But something is missing from the varied lives of those working people: the films of Ken Loach, most of which would bore them senseless. Forcing them to pay for his fantasies is unfair. If our pathologically cruel Tory overlords want to make even more cuts, I can think of a good place to start.
