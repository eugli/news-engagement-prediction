Caceres is currently without a club after leaving Juventus after a five-year spell in Serie A in June. Juan Cuadrado gets his groove back as Juventus dance past Internazionale | Paolo Bandini Read more \nCaceres is expected to agree a short-term deal that would bolster Southampton’s immediate defensive options, with an EFL Cup final against Manchester United at Wembley later this month. Virgil van Dijk, the Southampton captain, is sidelined through an ankle injury, and could be out until April, while the £8m sale of José Fonte to West Ham United has left manager Claude Puel short in defence. \nMaya Yoshida and the England Under-21 defender Jack Stephens were paired at the back for Southampton’s recent 3-1 defeat against West Ham. Southampton failed to replace Fonte in the January transfer window and pulled out of a deal to sign the Spartak Moscow defender Serdar Tasci. \nCaceres’s last competitive match was last February, for Juventus, and although short of match fitness, the defender boasts a wealth of experience, winning domestic titles in both Italy and Spain. \nThe defender, who recently went on trial at Milan, was of interest to Sam Allardyce and Crystal Palace but the London club opted to accelerate a move for Liverpool’s Mamadou Sakho instead last month.
