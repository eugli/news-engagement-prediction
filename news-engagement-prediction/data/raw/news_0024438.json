'For one, why would you do that, and for another, could it actually work?'\nAfter some consideration, Allison decided that as she was looking for love and had 'a pretty empty weekend on my hands', she would look into it.\nIn her research, she discovered that both The Joy of Sex by Dr. Alex Comfort and Aphrodisiacs by Linda Louisa Dell recount how women in the past had used their vaginal fluids as perfume by simply dabbing it onto their pulse points.\nAllison decided to take a slightly different approach in her own scent experiment, heading to the Institute for Art and Olfaction to create a perfume to combine with her natural scent.\nThere, she learned from founder and director Saskia Wilson-Brown that bodily fluids are not stable enough to be used in a formula, but that she could offer scents with properties that may aid Allison in her quest for love.\nIn the lab: Allison went to the Institute for Art and Olfaction where she toyed with scents\nThe final vial: She used a perfume of cedar, rose, and a synthetic imitation civet cat musk to match with her vaginal fluid to conduct the experiment\n'Saskia also clued me in that she had a few vials of synthetic pheromones in the lab,' she wrote. 'Then, she continued, there are scents like pumpkin pie, lavender, licorice, and doughnuts â€” said to increase blood flow to a guy's junk, according to a study conducted at the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago.'\nEventually she settled on a 'Christmassy' scent and a perfume of cedar, rose, and a synthetic imitation civet cat musk. She used the latter for her experiment, using a long Q-tip to extract the excretions from her vagina before dipping it into the perfume and dabbing it on her pulse points.\nShe repeated this process for three separate occasions, with the first being surprisingly successful.\nAfter inviting an old friend out for a double date, she applied the perfume and headed out to a bar, where drinking, catching up and fun in a photobooth led to a smooching session in which the gentlemen bit her lip claiming he couldn't help himself, saying: 'It's that scent you have.'\nThe next day she went through the process of applying perfume once again just for a trip to the gas station and McDonald's, finding that the cashier was more eager to greet her than usual.\nA few days later, she applied it once again for a breakfast date. Though he made no comments about her scent, the date was successful enough to have him arranging to see her again soon after.\nJessica concluded her experiment unconvinced that it was the perfume that made the difference, musing that the success could have all been down to 'the placebo effect', but did gain perspective that perhaps all she needs in her pursuit of love is what she already has.", "external_links": ["http://www.cosmopolitan.com/sex-love/a8647411/vagina-pheromone-perfume-experiment/?src=socialflowFB"], "published": "2017-02-08T21:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:14:13.395+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
