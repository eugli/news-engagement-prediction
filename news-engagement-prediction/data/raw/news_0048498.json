As a result, retailers must open themselves to potential prosecution by growing their own pot or buying it from criminal networks.\nOn Tuesday, the lower house, the Second Chamber, voted largely along party lines in narrowly approving the proposal . Submitted by lawmaker Vera Bergkamp, a member of the liberal D66 party, the measure passed by just five votes, 77-72 .\n\"One of my main motivations is to reduce as much as possible the risks to public health by regulating the cultivation can impose requirements on the production and hence on the quality,\" Bergkamp said. \"Another important point is that we achieve the cultivation [for] coffee shops ... and thus remove trade for organized crime.\n\"This is an important step to end a stalemate that has lasted far too long.\"\nContrary to popular belief, marijuana is a controlled substance in the Netherlands -- but small-scale distribution by licensed shops has been condoned since the mid 1970s. The Dutch Ministry of Justice has a policy of tolerance for so-called \"soft drugs,\" which covers cannabis, up to five grams. Large-scale dealing, cultivation, import and export, however, are heavily investigated and prosecuted by authorities.\nThe justice ministry's tolerance policy also allows cultivation of up to five marijuana plants. Supporters of the bill, however, argue that the government's legal view of marijuana cultivation directly conflicts with its tolerance for sales.\nTuesday's legislation, though, is thought to be unlikely to be passed by the senate, or First Chamber, BBC News reported . Prime Minister Mark Rutte opposes the measure.\nBergkamp said decriminalizing pot cultivation will wipe away the disconnect between the production and sale of marijuana, and make it safer for shops to acquire supplies of the drug.\nIf the legislation passes, marijuana production would be monitored and regulated -- and possibly taxed -- by the Dutch government.\n China's state tabloid warns South Korean company over THAAD Ukrainian billionaire faces extradition to U.S., Austrian court rules North Koreans say they've heard of Donald Trump but lack interest Riot breaks out in Stockholm neighborhood", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/upi", "https://twitter.com/Vera_Bergkamp/status/834047915240878080", "http://nltimes.nl/2017/02/21/dutch-mps-vote-legalize-cannabis-farming", "https://facebook.com/unitedpress", "https://d66.nl/tweede-kamer-regulering-wietteelt/", "https://www.instagram.com/upi/", "http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39045243", "https://www.ft.com/content/2bdd68fc-f84c-11e6-bd4e-68d53499ed71", "https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/drugs/inhoud/gedoogbeleid-softdrugs-en-coffeeshops"], "published": "2017-02-21T23:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:49:25.699+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
