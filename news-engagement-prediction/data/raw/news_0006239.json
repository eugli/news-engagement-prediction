Sometime Monday, a White House team made its way from Washington, D.C., to the ranch outside Boulder, Colorado, where Gorsuch lives with his wife, Louise, their daughters, Emma and Belinda, two horses and a cat.

It was White House Counsel Don McGahn who broke the bad news to the three who didn't get the nomination after a process that heavily involved McGahn, Vice President Mike Pence, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. \nWith an announcement scheduled for 8 p.m. ET Tuesday, secrecy was important, because Gorsuch had already been sussed out as a finalist.

From there, he was whisked via a country back road to a military jet, which flew him to Joint Base Andrews in the Maryland suburbs of Washington. Once he arrived in Washington, he stayed at the private residence of a friend. \nTrump and Gorsuch quickly hit it off, Conway said, but the deciding factor was Trump's conclusion that Gorsuch would adhere to the Constitution and not \"make stuff up.\" Hope you like my nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch for the United States Supreme Court. He is a good and brilliant man, respected by all. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 1, 2017 \nBy phone, the president personally invited Maureen Scalia — the widow of Justice Antonin Scalia, whom Gorsuch would succeed on the court — to attend the unveiling Tuesday night at the White House. Prominent Democrats were also invited, but they chose not to attend the East Room ceremony, Conway said. \nThe White House was described as \"really proud\" of how it handled the entire process — which went off without a single important leak.
