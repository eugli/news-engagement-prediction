Trump has vowed to move ahead with construction of his signature border wall, which he has repeatedly said Mexico will pay for, as well as signalling a new push to deport millions of unauthorized immigrants from the country.

The two had been locked in a battle over the border wall proposal even before Trump won the presidency. (Marco Ugarte/Associated Press) Pena Nieto's approval rating at record low \nWhile organizers of the marches promoted them as non-partisan, many singled out Pena Nieto as a major obstacle. \n\"We're also marching today to demand that our own rulers put an end to corruption and so much loss of life here and actually look out for the good of the country, not just themselves,\" said 28-year-old office worker Victor Robledo. \nLast month, a poll showed that Pena Nieto's approval ratings had hit a record low at just 12 per cent, the lowest level of support for any president in decades.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T01:03:33.412+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
