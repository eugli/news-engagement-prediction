(AP Photo/Jeff Swinger) (Photo: The Associated Press) \nPROVO, Utah (AP) â€” Nigel Williams-Goss scored 33 points and No. 1 Gonzaga remains the lone undefeated team in the country after an 85-75 victory over BYU on Thursday night. \nThe Bulldogs (23-0, 11-0 West Coast Conference) now have the longest winning streak in school history. They entered the night with the No. 12 scoring offense in the nation and looked like it. \nGonzaga took a 42-26 lead after dominating the first half. The Bulldogs used a 20-4 stretch early to put BYU in a deep hole. \nT.J. Haws did the heavy lifting during the BYU rally, as the Cougars got within six at one point, and finished with 26 points. \nThe Cougars (16-8, 7-4) had no answer early for the 7-foot-1, 300-pound Przemek Karnowski. Gonzaga ran the offense through the big man while building a 17-point lead and BYU was left to pick its poison. Karnowski would drop in a hook when left 1-on-1 against a defender, before the Cougars started sending help. Then Karnowski would kick it out and the Zags repeatedly found open shooters for 3-pointers. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T13:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T08:33:50.545+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
