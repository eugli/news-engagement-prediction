Photo: Pool/Getty Images As many observers predicted, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected the Justice Department’s attempt to overrule District Court Judge James Robart’s suspension of the Trump administration’s travel ban. But it was a bit of a surprise that the three-court panel — including George W. Bush appointee Richard Clifton, who gave counsel for the states opposing the government’s plea a hard time during oral arguments — ruled unanimously, and rejected so many of the government’s arguments that it augers poorly for Team Trump’s ability to revive the travel ban later on.\nIn the key section of the ruling, the judges concluded:\nTo rule on the Government’s motion, we must consider several factors, including whether the Government has shown that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its appeal, the degree of hardship caused by a stay or its denial, and the public interest in granting or denying a stay. We assess those factors in light of the limited evidence put forward by both parties at this very preliminary stage and are mindful that our analysis of the hardships and public interest in this case involves particularly sensitive and weighty concerns on both sides. Nevertheless, we hold that the Government has not shown a likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal, nor has it shown that failure to enter a stay would cause irreparable injury, and we therefore deny its emergency motion for a stay. In its discussion of the states’ due process argument, the 9th circuit panel categorically rejected the government’s claim that the president’s immigration and national security powers preclude intervention by the courts:\n[T]he Government has taken the position that the President’s decisions about immigration policy, particularly when motivated by national security concerns, are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections. The Government indeed asserts that it violates separation of powers for the judiciary to entertain a constitutional challenge to executive actions such as this one. There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy. Those are pretty strong words for a Per Curiam ruling on a procedural motion, and will probably get the attention of Donald J. Trump, who has already tweeted one of what could be many harsh comments in response:\nSEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 9, 2017 (Somebody should probably talk to the President about the inadvisability of SHOUTING WITH ALL CAPS.)\nThe judges also rejected the Justice Department’s claim that the travel ban should be immediately enforced with respect to non-resident aliens who cannot assert U.S. constitutional rights, holding that some resident aliens who can get into U.S. courts would be affected, and that citizens of the two states challenging the order could be affected indirectly as well.\nFinally, while the order did not entirely reject the government’s claims that the order did not violate Establishment Clause and equal protection provisions prohibiting religious discrimination, it did not accept them either, deferring the issue until it is weighed by Judge Robart, who issued the order putting the ban on hold. He will now get to proceed with his own deliberations, unless higher powers intervene.\nIt is likely the Justice Department will now petition the Supreme Court to grant the stay against Judge Robart’s order that the 9th Circuit just denied. It would take five justices to grant the stay, and in the present eight-justice SCOTUS, the four liberal members are not very likely to jump in at this point. But the lawyering will continue, and at this point those affected by the travel ban can, well, travel—but with an eye on the news.\nTags: travel ban donald trump ninth circuit constitution james robart supreme court More Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories Richard Branson Helps Obama Cram 8 Years of Relaxation Into One Vacation NYC’s Bodega Rally Was a Testament to Solidarity and Patriotism 24 Hours at JFK: The Hour-by-Hour Account of Two Iraqis’ Detainment and Release Most Viewed Stories Kellyanne Conway’s Endorsement of Ivanka Products Apparently Violates Federal Law Alec Baldwin Assures the Nation That His Upcoming SNL Episode Is Going to Be a ‘Big Deal’ Republican Senator Admits GOP Health-Care Plan Has to Remain Secret Because It Will Be Unpopular Kellyanne Conway Says to ‘Go Buy Ivanka’s Stuff’ A Brief History of ‘Cash Me Outside, Howbow Dah?’ Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus Want You to Know They Are Friends Watching Donald Trump Try to Puzzle Out What ‘Asset Forfeiture’ Means Is Deeply Discomfiting 30 Years Later, RoboCop Is More Relevant Than Ever Eight Legendary Women, All of Whom Are Jessica Lange 100 More Jokes That Shaped Modern Comedy Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer Finally a Way to Protect Elephants from Humans Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 11 mins ago Ninth Circuit Judges Unanimously Rebuff Trump, Keep Travel Ban on Hold The ruling more or less took apart the government’s case for rushing the ban into effect.\n6:39 p.m. Now That the Snowstorm’s Mostly Done, What’s the Damage?
