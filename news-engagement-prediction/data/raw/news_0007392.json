Our enemies have stated — and in Europe they have proven — they will take advantage of lax immigration procedures for the purposes of staging attacks. \n\"A temporary pause on immigration for the purpose of evaluating and improving vetting procedures makes sense. The United States is one of the most generous and compassionate nations. Our ability to care for and support countries and refugees in need resides in our own sense of security. If we don't feel safe, how can we protect others?\" \nCameron, who plays in the Premier League, is seemingly in the minority among his USA teammates. \nMichael Bradley, Alejandro Bedoya, Darlington Nagbe and Sacha Kljestan have already been critical of the ban. \nRecently re-appointed USA head coach Bruce Arena is against the ban as well. \n\"I think it's sad because one thing we do in our sport is that we are a global sport,\" Arena told The Washington Post . \"We travel the world. We meet all kinds of people. And we conclude at the end that they are all beautiful people. \n\"We have bad people in the world, we have bad people in our country, but clearly a large majority of people are good. It's fabulous when we can give them an opportunity to be part of our country.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T08:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T04:01:50.224+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
