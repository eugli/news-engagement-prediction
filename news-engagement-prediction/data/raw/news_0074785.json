(Charles Reed/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Sunday, February 26, 2017, 5:58 PM \nThe head of the NYPD sergeants union blasted Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner James O'Neill for their refusal to cooperate with the Trump administration's deportation policies. \n\"It's almost like the world is upside down right now,\" Ed Mullins, president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, said Sunday on the John Catsimatidis AM 970 radio show. \"The people who are committing crimes, they don't belong in the country.\" \nTrump's Department of Homeland Security has issued expansive deportation policies labeling any undocumented immigrant who is charged with any crime or violation of law, regardless of its severity, a priority for deportation. Also covered are people here illegally who receive government assistance or use fake Social Security numbers to work. \nWith the exception of 170 serious crimes, the city refuses to turn over unauthorized immigrants who have been arrested in response to detainer requests from the feds. The city also requires a judge's warrant to hand someone over. \nNYPD won't round up immigrants under Trump's deportation orders \n\"We can't ignore people who commit crimes and facilitate an atmosphere of harboring them because we want to get votes in an election year. It's just terrible to do that,\" Mullins said. \"If you're arrested, you commit a misdemeanor, you commit felonies — why are we going to tolerate this?\" \nO'Neill issued a defiant memo last week saying NYPD officers would not assist with Trump's directive to round up undocumented immigrants. Cops will not enforce administrative warrants issued by federal immigration officials to pick up people here illegally. Sergeants union honcho Ed Mullins slammed Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner James O'Neill for opposing Trump's deportation policies. (Michael Schwartz/for New York Daily News) \n\"It is critical that everyone who comes into contact with the NYPD, regardless of their immigration status, be able to identify themselves or seek assistance without hesitation, anxiety or fear,\" O'Neill said. \nBut Mullins said rank and file cops want to assist Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. \nPol: NYC's broken windows policing helps Trump deport immigrants \n\"Make no mistake about it, the members of law enforcement in the NYPD want to cooperate with ICE. I speak to cops everyday — they want to cooperate with ICE, they want to work with fellow law enforcement agents,\" he said. \n\"There is a moral obligation, and as the chief law enforcement officer of the city, you yourself have to be able to follow the direction of law. We don't get to participate in the laws that we want,\" Mullins said. \"That's total lunacy.\" \nThe city's pro-immigrant policies have made it one of the \"sanctuary cities\" targeted by Trump, who has threatened to withdraw federal funding. Mayor de Blasio (r.) and Police Commissioner James O'Neill (l.) have refused to comply with the feds in carrying out deportations.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:23:25.260+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
