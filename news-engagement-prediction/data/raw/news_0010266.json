'For us as twins the best thing was that we both had it. Or neither of us had it, so that one didn’t feel guilty.' The girls share a snap of their parents who both died from cancer - their father Paul aged 64, and their mother Sally aged 39 The girls remain positive throughout their turbulent year and promise to only look towards the future 'Our dad supports us he’s a man of few words. He probably wishes we didn’t have to go through it. BRCA1/BRCA2 GENES Both genes produce tumour suppressor proteins that help to repair damaged DNA and keep cells' genetic material stable. A mutation in either gene means its protein isn't made or doesn't work properly so that DNA damage isn't repaired correctly. This makes cells more likely to experience more genetic alterations that can lead to cancer, pushing the risk to 85 per cent. Preventative surgery can reduce the risk of cancer to 12 per cent - lower than that of the general population. A mutation can be passed on from a mother or father and you have a 50 per cent chance of inheriting it if your parent is a carrier. He thinks it’s the right thing to do, he watched mum go through it and he doesn’t want to watch us go through it.' Rose added: 'I believe everything happens for a reason. 'For me I don’t have to do what mum did, I have a chance to stop that happening.' Both of the girls opted to have different initial surgeries with Rose having breast tissue remove and implants put in straight away. Charlotte decided to just undergo her mastectomy at first and have implants at a later date. After surgery Charlotte recalls seeing her scars for the first time was an extremely emotional moment: 'When I looked down I knew I was going to be flat chested. 'But seeing it in reality was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be. 'In my head I looked awful. Now I will show my scars and I am proud of them, but it probably took a good week of my fiance Rob showing me TLC to get to the point where I thought they were okay.' Ahead of surgery, Rose explained how her breasts were a real part of her identity, saying: 'They are my greatest asset, everyone knows me for them. Rose decided to celebrate her breasts in a special photoshoot before she went for her preventatitive double mastectomy to have them removed Charlotte says that it's a shame her mother - who died on remembrance day - didn't get to meet her fiance and won't get to see her at her wedding Rose said that her breasts made her confident and she would miss them. She had implants in at the same time as her mastectomy operation Charlotte and Rose both opted to have different surgeries - Charlotte having just her mastectomy, while Rose had her implants fitted at the same time ‘They’re my confidence, I think that’s what it is. And they’re being taken away.' Despite their difficulties, the twins did their best to stay positive during their turbulent year, and the grief of losing their father. 'The sad bit is done, we have to look towards the future,' Rose said. 'We have to look at the positives. There are so many, as opposed to not liking your body or your body not looking normal or like it should. That doesn’t matter if you live longer.'
