Facebook: video.php ID: 10524629 \nRoberts flagged One Nation leader Pauline Hanson’s intention to release an alternative youth employment plan, but gave no details on what it would entail. \nUnions branded PaTH as a “$4-per-hour jobs-for-young-people” scheme. The peak body representing interns, Interns Australia, feared it would lead to exploitative unpaid internships and “ erode the still unclear rights of interns”. \nA government-dominated Senate committee admitted last year there was a significant lack of detail around how the PaTH internships would work. It advised that the employment minister needed to offer “clear guidance on all aspects of the PaTH program” before it was voted through the Senate. This has not happened. A spokesperson for employment minister Michaelia Cash refused to admit the bill was dead on Tuesday, telling BuzzFeed News negotiations were ongoing.
