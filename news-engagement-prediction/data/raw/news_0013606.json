Then a barrage of accurate Tom Brady passes brought them back from a seemingly certain demise — to an overtime period and eventual victory. But that beguilingly simple summary omits the fact that, even while they were losing, the Patriots had their offense on the field much longer. The Falcons’ offensive efficiency worked against their defense’s need to rest — so that by the fourth quarter, all the Brady passes that were being deflected at the start were finally finding their target. This fatigue can be modeled in a game like Madden , as can a resurgent team’s momentum, but for all the decades that I’ve played games, I’ve always known I’m dealing with mathematical formulae in the background. To win at competitive video games, you need passion, practice, skill, and a ton of self-belief. But ultimately, you’re still dealing with a human-designed, limited system that can be reverse-engineered and exploited. There’s too much precision and certainty in video games. Precision is an unnatural thing — and though you might argue there’s precious little that counts as \"natural\" about beefed-up NFL players, there’s no denying that we’re more impressed when a person achieves victory by using both their body and their mind. Julian Edelman on Tom Brady calling it best catch he's seen: \"I think that's because of our bromance.\" pic.twitter.com/dQYewYKVwv — Mike Reiss (@MikeReiss) February 6, 2017 This is the thing missing from e-sports as a spectacle: the exhibition of athleticism to go with the great mental fortitude already on display. Brady wasn’t just pushing buttons at the right time, he had to weigh every pass precisely while dodging onrushing hordes of bruisers desperate to flatten him. And when I look at Julian Edelman’s contused shoulders after the game, I’m reminded of the Isle of Man bike racers that I met in 2015, people for whom picking up injuries was just a price of doing business. They push the human body to its absolute limits, and it’s the same mix of skill and physicality that also makes the likes of Serena Williams, LeBron James, and Leonardo Messi amazing to watch as well. I actually think it’s quite cool that you can compete in e-sports without having a reckless disregard for concussions . But there’s a certain subconscious resonance I felt while watching the New England Patriots literally battling their way back that I can never derive from video games. It just felt more real.
