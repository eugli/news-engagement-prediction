Gauahar and Kushal were madly in love with each other when they were in the Bigg Boss house. But soon after coming out, they parted ways. The ex-duo hit headlines for their ugly break-up and nasty conversations in public domain. And once again they were in news, however, not for their clash, but for their exchange of sweet messages. \nRecently Kushal Posted a very sweet message for Gauahar, as the actress posed for Stardust Magazine. Kushal wrote “@haiderkhanhaider saw this picture … click by my brother Haider khan ….. could not risisset my self to share this picture of this stunner …. @gauaharkhan lady with grace , panache, ooomp and style with a golden heart …… ????✨” \nCheck out this picture: A post shared by Kushal Tandon (@therealkushaltandon) on Feb 12, 2017 at 10:13am PST \nBut as soon Stardust magazine saw this post they replied with an official statement. It said: \nDear Media, \nStardust would like to clarify that the post of Gauahar Khan on Instagram with the Stardust masthead has nothing to do with us. AJAY DEVGN is gracing the cover of Stardust February issue. We have come across a few articles which state that Gauahar is on the cover, so we would like to clear the air by saying that the news is false. \nGauahar was also contacted for the same by us and unfortunately she cannot delete the post as she thinks the media will make news of the same and again question her reconciliation with Kushal Tandon. \nAnd Legal action will be taken against the one who has used the masthead without our permission, thus defying our Company Policy. \nRegards, \nTeam Stardust \nAs per the sources of Tellychakkar.com, Gauahar did shoot for the magazine but it was not for the cover. \nWell, we can see big trouble coming up for Gauahar Khan.
