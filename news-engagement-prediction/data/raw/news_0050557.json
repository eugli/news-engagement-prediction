By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: February 20, 2017 2:34 PM Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Monday renewed his attack on BSP supremo Mayawati, claiming she can go for a possible electoral understanding with BJP after elections. \nUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Monday renewed his attack on BSP supremo Mayawati, claiming she can go for a possible electoral understanding with BJP after elections. Addressing a rally during the campaign for the fourth phase of UP Assembly Eections 2017, the CM said, “Beware of Mayawati. In the past she had celebrated ‘raksha bandhan’ with BJP and she can do it again.” \nEarlier, Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati accused the BJP of spreading rumors about the post-poll alliance with her party. Addressing a rally at Kanpur, Mayawati said, “BJP is spreading rumors through social media that BJP and BSP are going to form the government together.” “We are ready to sit in opposition but will not form the government with the help of BJP. No question of going into an alliance with SP and Congress ,” she added. \nWatch this video \nHigh-decibel campaign has begun for the fourth phase of Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections 2017. 53 assembly seats will go polls on February 23. BJP led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has taken on Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance by unleashing a number of jibes at Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi . BSP led by Maywati is trying to reach out to voters. \nOver 61.16 per cent of the electorate yesterday exercised their franchise in the third phase of polling to decide the fate of 826 candidates in Uttar Pradesh’s 69 Assembly constituencies considered crucial for the ruling Samajwadi Party. The turnout, which is higher by more than 1 per cent as compared to last Assembly polls, is expected to go up and touch 63 per cent as many voters were still in queues outside polling booths when the percentage was collated at 5 pm, officials said.About 2.41 crore people, including 1.10 crore women and 1,026 people belonging to the ‘third gender’ category, were eligible to vote in this phase. He said the polling was by and large peaceful in this phase for which tight security arrangements were put in place at all the 25,603 polling booths. \nMayawati had taken a dig at Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav for his sarcastic comments on elephant statues installed in parks and memorials by her, saying the “babua” (immature child) was helping her party get free publicity ahead of Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls. “The ‘babua’ is repeatedly saying that BSP’s elephants are standing for the past nine years and are not moving…it seems the election symbol of BSP is tormenting him (Akhilesh) even in his dreams….However, this is giving us free publicity at election time,” she said.
