These are the things that we've probably forgotten to demonstrate to tourists,\" Tengku Adnan said when launching the KL Rush Explorace 2017 programme yesterday. \nLast year, Mastercard's Global Destinations Cities Index reported that Kuala Lumpur was ranked seventh in the Top 10 Most Visited Cities, with more than 12 million tourists recorded. \nMeanwhile, Tengku Adnan said the KL Rush Explorace 2017 programme, which was held for the first time, would be extended to Putrajaya and Labuan in the future. \nHe said the programme, to be turned into an annual event, was aimed at increasing awareness among society on historical places and tourist destinations. \nAbout 600 people participated in the event which started from the Menara Kuala Lumpur and covered several tourist hot spots, such as the National Museum, Lake Gardens and the Dataran Merdeka. \n- Bernama \nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T03:35:13.531+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
