How do the oppressor and oppressee work together if they're not involved together, if we don't have those open discussions?\" Laframboise asked Monday.\nBlack Lives Matter Vancouver asked police last summer to remove their float from the parade as a \"show of solidarity and understanding,\" to acknowledge the presence of uniformed officers makes some participants feel unsafe.\nThe request from the activist group came shortly after its Toronto counterpart brought that city's parade to a standstill until organizers agreed to a list of demands, including barring police floats from future marches.\nThe Vancouver chapter launched an online petition three weeks ago asking that the Vancouver Pride Society, which runs the event, prohibit uniformed police officers from marching. By Monday, it had collected 875 signatures.\nBlack Lives Matter Vancouver did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in an open letter published last July it said allowing police to participate is \"insulting\" to protesters who made Pride celebrations possible.\n\"We acknowledge that in certain contexts police presence to perform a job of civil service may deter acts of homophobia and violence, especially at designated queer events such as Pride,\" the letter said.\n\"However, we cannot divorce the policing institution from its historical and continued violence against indigenous and (minority) communities, racial profiling or inaction around our missing indigenous women.\"\nLaframboise said while the grievances of Black Lives Matter are real and warrant discussion, the Pride Parade isn't the appropriate venue because it has evolved from a protest march to a celebration of diversity and inclusion.\nThe Vancouver Pride Parade regularly attracts more than 100 floats and crowds in excess of 500,000. This year's event will take place in early August. Police have marched in Vancouver's parade since 2002.\nKieran Burgess, executive director of operations with the Vancouver Pride Society, said in an email that the group's board received the counter-petition Monday afternoon and was looking into allowing the organizers to speak at the society's board meeting in March.\nLaframboise delivered the document alongside fellow activists Velvet Steele and Kristine Andersen.\n\"I think it went really well,\" Steele said after leaving the Vancouver Pride Society office.\n\"We're not here to start an argument,\" she added. \"We're not trying to divide the community.\"\nThe media accompanying the group was prevented from entering the society's office.\nLaframboise said the Pride society had agreed to meet with them on March 21, about a week before the society is scheduled to meet with the Vancouver Police Board.\nIn the early 1990s, Laframboise was involved in a liaison committee aimed at improving relations between the transgender community and Vancouver police.\nThe self-described transgender Metis activist calls Vancouver police one of the most progressive law enforcement agencies in Canada and commended the administration for its willingness to sit down with community groups to work on policy.\n\"Have there been some bad apples? Yes. Have there been some rude police officers? Absolutely. Have there been some issues in the trans community? Absolutely,\" Laframboise said.\n\"But I still want to work with the police to affect changes.\"\nRelated Stories 'Do not tell us how to organize': Petition calls for VPD to remain in Pride Parade VPD plans to participate in Pride, despite Black Lives Matter petition", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:21:10.585+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
