Moreover, the policy lashed out at the government’s decision to build a university campus at Żonqor in Marsascala, for the simple reason that part of it protruded on a stretch of land outside the development zone. \nThe MP’s announcement on his intention to withdraw this controversial application came within hours of the story, in a statement released in early afternoon. While insisting he had no plans to build a villa, and that he submitted an application in line with existing policies, Mr Bezzina said he decided to abandon the project as he placed “political principles”, before other considerations. \nIn a prompt reaction, the Labour Party said that Mr Bezzina had only withdrawn the application because he had been caught red-handed, and not because he genuinely believed that he was in the wrong. While accusing the PN of hypocrisy on the environment, the PL warned that the case was far from over. « What's on today's newspapers Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=57434007292&n=b1e6f901' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=57434007292&n=b1e6f901' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \nSee our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.
