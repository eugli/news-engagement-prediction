Ad Feedback \nJudge Phillips told Banks he was \"an absolutely tragedy\". \nThe 22-year-old had a good education, good career prospects, and the support of a loving family and friends. \nAnyone \"stupid enough\" to follow his example needed to be deterred as drugs were a \"scourge to the community\", Phillips said. \n\"When you were doing what you were doing you didn't give a toss.\" \nThe court heard Banks imported a kilogram of ethyloneâ€‹ using the name of a tourist staying in Arrowtown. \nIn 2015 he also supplied MDMA to flatmates, before coming to the attention of police. \nPolice estimated Banks earned up to $133,000 dollars from his drug offending, and officers found hundreds of glass vials and caps at his flat. \nIn July 2016, a drainage pipe containing a large amount of drugs and Banks' fingerprints was uncovered. \nSteroids, vials, cash, and a pipe used to smoke methamphetamine were found later. \n\"It is serious drug offending,\" Phillips said. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T08:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:39:48.011+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
