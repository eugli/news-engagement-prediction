The audience will now see a totally different story which will focus on Devanshi, ofcourse, and her love life. If reports are to believed then Swaragini ‘s Helly Shah is in talks with the makers to play the lead. Anuj Fakih might also be seen on the show as Sakshi (Devanshi’s sister). \nThere were reports that Kumkum Bhagya fame Arjit Taneja has also been approached for the show. A source was quoted by an entertainment portal as saying, “After an extensive hunt, the makers have finalised on Arjit. He recently did a mock shoot with Helly and if things fall in place he will be signed to play the male protagonist.” \nHowever, as per a report in India Forums, Arjit has turned down the offer. The actor admits that he was approached for Devanshi but could not take it up because of some date issues. “Yes, I was approached for the show. And as much as I wanted to, I am not taking it up, ” he told the portal. \nIt remains to be seen who will fill in for Arjit. It’s being said that the character, despite of being from the same village, will have a progressive mindset. He will be against Godwoman Kusum Sundari (Karuna Pandey) and will fight against all the ill practices done in the name of religion. We will also get to witness a love triangle between him, Devanshi and her sister Sakshi. The male lead will be in love with Devanshi and will be unaware of the fact that Sakshi loves him. \nArjit gained instant recognition and huge appreciation for his stint on Zee TV’s Kumkum Bhagya. There were reports that he left the show to become a part of Bigg Boss 10, but it later turned out to be false. We hope to see the handsome hunk on television soon.
