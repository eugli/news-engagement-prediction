We look forward to one. But, while we’re waiting for it, billions more bags will be piling up in the landfills. Why not let New York start working on this problem right away, however imperfect its approach? Other cities have done this; it works. By kicking the bag down the road, with little reason to hope that the Legislature will be any more supportive of this issue a year from now, Mr. Cuomo looks more than a little inconsistent. He’s not exactly known for letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. And isn’t he the governor who likes to say , “In this state, with all our diversity, there is no one size fits all, so we work region by region”? So why does New York City have to wait while the state government finds some bag plan that applies to Malone and Elmira, too? Why punish New York City but not Suffolk County (population 1.5 million) and the city of Long Beach, which have passed similar bag fees? Does Long Island inhabit some special zone exempt from the logic of Albany? \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .
