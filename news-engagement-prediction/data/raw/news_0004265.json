(Ahn Young-joon/AP) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  45 PM \nSEOUL, South Korea — In an explicit warning to North Korea, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Friday said any use of nuclear weapons by the North on the United States or its allies would be met with what he called an \"effective and overwhelming\" response. \nU.S. defense secretaries have long offered assurances to South Korea and Japan that its nuclear \"umbrella\" will protect them, but Mattis' statement was perhaps more pointed than most. He made the remarks during an appearance with his South Korean counterpart, Defense Minister Han Min Koo. \n\"North Korea continues to launch missiles, develop its nuclear weapons program, and engage in threatening rhetoric and behavior,\" Mattis said with Han standing at his side and U.S. and South Korean flags at their backs. \n\"We stand with our peace-loving Republic of Korea ally to maintain stability on the peninsula and in the region,\" he added. \"America's commitments to defending our allies and to upholding our extended deterrence guarantees remain ironclad: Any attack on the United States, or our allies, will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with a response that would be effective and overwhelming.\" Mattis had a warning for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. (© KCNA KCNA / Reuters/REUTERS) \nMattis' statement showed by he chose South Korea for his first visit overseas since becoming defense secretary Jan. 20. He sought to reassure South Koreans of the longstanding U.S. commitment to a defense treaty that President Donald Trump suggested during the campaign was a bad deal for America. \nMattis also was discussing with the South Koreans a timetable for deploying an advanced U.S. missile defense system, the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAAD, that is meant to improve protection of South Korea and Japan — as well as U.S. troops stationed in both countries — against a North Korean missile attack. \nThe U.S. has 28,500 troops permanently based in South Korea and about 50,000 in Japan.

(Ahn Young-joon/AP) \nThe current caretaker South Korean government has said it supports THAAAD deployment, but the decision is in doubt because of approaching national elections. \nIn his remarks Friday, Han echoed Mattis' concern about North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. He said they \"blatantly threaten\" the international community and have created a \"severe security situation\" on the Korean peninsula. He described Mattis' visit so early in his tenure as a warning to North Korea.
