Nick Saban (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 8:52  52 p.m. ET \nWhen a team wins back-to-back national recruiting titles, it's a surprise. When a team wins seven consecutive recruiting titles, it's Alabama. \nThat was the case for Nick Saban on Wednesday after the Alabama coach signed a historic seventh No. 1 class, according to 247Sports' Composite rankings. \nMORE: Former No. 1 recruits: Where are they now? \nYes, the familiar crimson behemoth has once again claimed supremacy over the rest of college football. You'd have to go all the way back to 2010, when fellow Southeastern Conference school Florida earned the top spot in the rankings, to find the last time Alabama wasn't atop the recruiting rankings. At this point, college football's mad dash to secure the best talent in the nation is becoming a race to finish second behind Alabama. \nThat's because Saban’s coaching philosophy — popularly known as “The Process\" — is now just as prevalent in recruiting as it is on the football field. After all, what other team could challenge Alabama’s unprecedented success better than, well, Alabama? \nThe Tide recruited their highest-rated class of the Saban era with this group, and the second highest-rated class in history behind that Florida class. This year's haul features six five-star recruits, including early enrollees in running back Najee Harris (No. 3 overall), offensive tackle Alex Leatherwood (No. 4), linebacker Dylan Moses (No. 13), receiver Jerry Jeudy (No. 21) and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa (No. 32). Defensive end LaBryan Ray (No. 26) signed his letter of intent Wednesday. \nHere's a sign of just how remarkably unremarkable that number is (to Alabama, at least). The Tide didn't even break their own record for most five-star recruits in a class. Their 2013 and ‘14 classes had six apiece as well. \nMORE: Top 20 recruiting classes since 2000 \nAnd what was Saban’s reaction to his latest recruiting title? \n“I know everybody wants to look at all these rankings and ratings,” he said at a National Signing Day news conference. “But it's like I tell players who go out for the draft: It's not about where you get drafted; it's about what you do with your opportunity.” \nIt seems Saban takes his own advice to heart and does a lot with his opportunities on the recruiting trail. Since his first full recruiting cycle in 2008, Alabama has never finished outside the top five in the 247Sports Composite and has signed a nation-leading 42 five-star recruits in that time period. Of those classes, 15 Saban recruits have been selected in the first round of the NFL Draft. \nIf anyone has ever wondered how Saban has coached Alabama to four national championships, five Southeastern Conference championships and three consecutive berths in the College Football Playoff, there's a big part of your answer. \nMORE: Can a four-star QB stay four seasons? \nLike Saban said, recruiting is only part of Alabama’s success. He combines that with some of the best coaching in the country, top-notch football facilities and a ravenous fan base, to create a positive feedback loop of success: Get the best recruits. Coach ‘em up. Win lots of games. Get national exposure. Get the best recruits. \nAs long as Saban keeps following that formula, Alabama is going to keep making history.
