(Photo by Pattarapong Chatpattarasil) - + A number of monks have begun a hunger strike as a new tactic to put pressure on the government to lift Section 44 which was invoked to allow for a full search of Wat Phra Dhammakaya. \nSeven monks began the hunger strike at Khlong Luang market outside the temple on Wednesday and the temple warned that more will join them until authorities end the special power used to take control of the vast compound. \nWat Phra Dhammakaya has repeatedly demanded the lifting of Section 44 imposed on the temple to help authorities led by the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) arrest the former abbot Phra Dhammajayo. \nThe former abbot faces several arrest warrants on charges over forest encroachment in connection with his meditation centres in several provinces, money laundering and receiving stolen assets in connection with the multi-billion-baht embezzlement at Klongchan Credit Union Co-operative. \nSo far, they have not found the 72-year-old monk after searching the premises. \nPolice are blocking monks and disciples of the temple from going inside and convincing those inside to leave as they are confident that the embattled monk is still hiding in the temple in Khlong Luang district in Pathum Thani. \nMonks at the temple are tight-lipped on his whereabouts. \nThe latest talks on Wednesday to get permission for another search collapsed after five hours. \nThe temple rejected another search, said DSI deputy director-general Pol Maj Col Suriya Singhakamol after talks with the temple led by deputy abbot Phra Thattachewo. \nAlso on Wednesday, four senior officials responsible for areas around the temple have been transferred to inactive posts as they were seen helping monks and followers of Phra Dhammajayo. \nVideo by Wichan Charoenkiatpakul", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T19:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T15:26:13.058+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
