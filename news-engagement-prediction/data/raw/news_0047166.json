Steep learning curve \nRob Armstrong took up mountain unicycling in 2008 after spending years mountain biking. \n\"It's really hard for beginners because you've got this steep, hard learning curve and the other riders of course are just riding along happily,\" he said. \nMr Armstrong said mounting a unicycle was the hardest part. \n\"If you get it wrong, you fall off and you have to do it again. \n\"The more tired you get the more you fall off; it's rinse and repeat, and it just gets very, very tiring and very, very frustrating very quickly.\" \nBut mastering the unicycle appears to be worth the effort. \n\"You could almost say it's addictive,\" Mr Evershed said.
