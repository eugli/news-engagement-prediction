Conway claimed that people were forgetting that the Obama Administration banned Iraqis from the U.S. after two refugees entered the country, became radicalized, and went on a killing spree. \nThe problem here is that while two Iraqis were arrested on terrorism charges, no such massacre ever took place. Conway eventually walked back her false claim, but not before it was picked up by the media and made into a significant source of ridicule . \nBelow you can see photos from the scene: Amazing: New Yorkers held a mock vigil tonight at Bowling Green subway stop to honor the 'massacre' victims. https://t.co/b9x6gRrusc pic.twitter.com/CqobWatlyq", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T11:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:46:44.466+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
