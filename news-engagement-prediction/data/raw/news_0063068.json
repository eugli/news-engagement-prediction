They are currently paying Tk 7 per cubic metre. \nIt means that stove-based charges are rising by 50 percent while meter-based gas cost will go up 60 percent. \nPrice of compressed natural gas (CNG), used for automobiles, will go up from Tk 35 to 38 per cubic metre in March and to Tk 40 in June. \nThe 14.28 percent hike will drive the public transport fare up. \nFor power generation, fertiliser production, industries and commercial entities, gas prices are rising by 5 to 50 percent. \nThe businessmen will raise goods and commodity prices to offset the increased charge and it will be the consumers whose pockets will burn. \nBangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission (BERC) released a public notice over the revised prices on Thursday. Monowar Islam BERC Chairman Monowar Islam said the prices are going up by 22.7 percent on average.\nThe Sheikh Hasina government raised the gas prices for the last time on Sep 1, 2015 by 26.29 percent on average. \nBERC held public hearings from Aug 7 to 17 last year on state-run gas distribution firms' proposal to hike the prices, following which the new prices have been announced.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T00:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:09:15.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
