Article continues below \nSpeaking to Reuters , Alvarez said the proposed fight was \"a joke for boxing if it happens\" and was \"purely a businessman fight while he prefers to have a serious fight.\" \nThe 26-year-old Mexican has had a distinguished career for someone so young, having already amassed 50 fights for a record of 48 wins, one draw, and one loss. Article continues below \nHis only defeat in his career to date came at the hands of Mayweather when he was outpointed in a majority decision in 2013. \nAlvarez next takes on his fellow Mexican Julio Cesar Chavez in May. \nIn terms of the Mayweather fight with McGregor, there have been many claims and counter claims between the two camps in regards to the fight taking place, which for the average punter has made it very hard to keep up with. \nHowever, Alvarez is not keen on the idea. \nHe said : \"It's a joke for boxing if that happens. \n\"It is a businessman fight. I like to fight a serious fight.\" \nRenowned trainer Freddie Roach has now claimed that Mayweather told him the fight would happen. \nSpeaking with The MMA Hour Roach said: \"Everything is pointing in the right direction. He(McGregor) will have his hands full with a boxer like Floyd but he is sellable and making noise. \n\"I think Mayweather is the favourite due to his all-round boxing ability, but I wouldn't count anyone out. Especially as McGregor throws hard and he is not afraid to throw.\" \nRoach said he would consider preparing Mayweather for the fight if called upon and felt it would be 'a great honour' if that was the case. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
