Sportsbooks offered a chance to bet on the over/under for the performance, with the total time set at two minutes, 9 seconds. Bryan took his time out of the gates, but ended up going UNDER, with a time of 2:04. Last year, the National Anthem prop bet stirred up a bit of controversy, when Lady Gaga (performing in the Super Bowl halftime show this year) repeated the word “brave” a second time as jets flew over Levi’s Stadium. This led to some books paying the over and some others paying the under for the prop bet. Two years ago, Idina Menzel took her time, going over by three seconds. The previous year, Renee Fleming blazed through the song at a quicker pace, coming in well under. The NFL generally selects well-known singers to perform the anthem, but even the biggest of stars can get a bit nervous when they’re performing on live TV in front of virtually the entire world, in an event as big as the Super Bowl. One singer who certainly felt the nerves was Christina Aguilera, who — well on her way to the over — skipped a verse of the song. Many casinos called her performance a push, while others even elected to refund customers. Aguilera’s performance sparked bets of whether a performer would miss a word in future anthem performances, though that bet stopped when Menzel did not miss any words in her performance a couple of years ago.
