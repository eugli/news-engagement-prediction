It does not look like this yet, but as long as a chance exists I will do everything I can. I will not give up,\" he said. \nHe said the voice of Remainers would be heard more widely as Britain gets closer to Brexit. \n\"Once the impact of May's position becomes apparent, Brexit opponents’ voices will carry more weight again. At the present time, every critic of the government is treated as a traitor, and there is hardly any debate. This will change when people start realising what is coming toward them.\" \nBradshaw said he has \"never thought much of referendums\" which he described as \"stupid\" and believed that Cameron's decision to hold one on the EU would mean he would \" go down as the worst prime minister in the history of our country.\" \nOn January 17, May outlined her negotiating stance for Brexit , which included a rejection of the Single Market and an end to the free movement of people, resulting in a so-called \"hard Brexit.\" \nMay plans to trigger Article 50 before the end of March, which will start the official two-year negotiation period for Britain leaving the EU. \nYou can read the full interview with Ben Bradshaw at Business Insider Deutschland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T23:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T19:00:07.997+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
