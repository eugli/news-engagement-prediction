They tried to save him for 13 hours.“But I don’t understand. I feel like if Kaden had just had the medication he needed earlier he would be here today. He had been so unwell for so long, he never even complained from the pain, but he needed help. “It took two years to get Kaden an appointment at Alder Hey, they diagnosed him straight away but it was too late.”\nKaden continued to attend school while in agony Credit: MEN Syndication The family’s ordeal began two years ago, when Kaden woke up one day with pain in one of his ankles, which a GP diagnosed as a sprain. But the pain grew worse and 18 months ago, when it moved to his other ankle, Caitlin took him to Blackpool Victoria Hospital’s A&E.\nBlood tests showed him to have a vitamin D deficiency and anaemia. In hospital for a week, he was discharged with a bottle of Calpol and Ibuprofen as well as vitamin D and iron tablets. But the pain spread to Kaden’s knees then all his joints. Referred to rheumatology at Blackpool, Caitlin claims they gave him more Calpol despite an ultrasound showing tissue damage.\nFinally, after months of delays, Kaden got an appointment at Alder Hey Hospital, where doctors were so shocked they suspected leukaemia. They diagnosed systemic onset juvenile arthritis and started a course of steroids - which immediately began to ease his pain. But the arthritis was attacking Kaden’s joints and organs and he was placed on a high dependency unit.\nKaden died from sepsis as a result of his arthritis.

Kaden died the following day and medics told the family it was caused by sepsis as a result of his arthritis. Caitlin added: “I want to know exactly what happened. “How can a healthy boy go from having a sore ankle two years ago to being gone?”\nA spokesman for Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: “Upon hearing of his death the trust initiated a case review which is ongoing and is standard procedure in all children’s deaths.”\n Greater Manchester", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T08:52:43.498+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
