And it is clear that he is behind some of the disruption -- critics would say disarray -- that is emanating from the administration. The President and Bannon have compatible world views, and a mutual desire to shatter norms and face off with institutions. Trump also respects Bannon, in part because of his successful business background, a source familiar with their relationship said. The source also noted that Bannon might be the one person in the West Wing who could stand up to Trump. \"Sometimes he needs to hear, 'Hey, step away from that,' and I think Bannon is the guy that can do that better than anybody in there,\" one source said. \"He's the most grown up guy in the room.\" In that respect, Bannon is a useful counterweight to Kushner, the source said, adding, \"Ultimately your son-in-law is not going to tell you things you don't want to hear all the time.\" Still, the husband of Trump's daughter, Ivanka, is also emerging as a force in his own right in the White House. Multiple sources said that Kushner was a key conduit between Trump and foreign leaders, and has been playing an important role in his diplomacy in recent weeks. He is also a fixture at Trump's almost nightly working dinners in the White House residence that draw Cabinet members, military brass and lawmakers. But while Kushner has been a steadying force on foreign policy, sometimes the President's advisers are responsible for the fomenting the kind of disarray that worries McCain and Thomas. Miller, for instance, went on Sunday talk shows and renewed Trump's claims that millions of illegal voters backed Democrat Hillary Clinton in November's election. His claims dumfounded the Beltway media and Trump's opponents and sowed another of the controversies that some Washington observers worry drag the White House's focus away from crucial issues. But the person who mattered most thought his performance was outstanding. Congratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017 \"Congratulations Stephen Miller - on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job!\" Trump tweeted. So while Trump's critics are pained at the impact his disruptive governing strategy is having outside his White House, the President is sending a clear signal that he has no interest in changing his style.
