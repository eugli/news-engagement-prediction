A spokesman said: ‘Our cleaning experts are always being asked exactly how often we should clean things - from beds and curtains to hobs and toilets. ‘Frankly, housework can feel like a never ending task, and nobody wants to overdo it. So here, by popular demand, we have created a guide to what to clean when.’ While the advice will be useful, it may well go over the head of many young people, who are used to being followed around by parents waiting on them hand and foot. At the same time, many families, including those on modest incomes, now rely on help from a cleaner. And there is also a booming market in robot cleaners. Research published by retail analysts Mintel last year found the average time households spend cleaning fell by 32minutes compared to 2014. It said the average time per week was down from 4hrs and 39mins in 2014 to 4hrs and 7mins in 2016. The Mintel study found cleaning the oven is the task people hate the most. New research from Mintel found the average household cleaning time fell by 32 minutes last year compared to 2014 Some 67per cent rank it among their top three dislikes along with cleaning the toilet – 47per cent - and windows – 41per cent. Despite the claims of men to be taking on a greater share of household chores, women were still doing the heavy lifting in the kitchen and bathroom. The average cleaning time for a woman was put at 90mins longer each week at 4hrs and 51mins. Brand and Household Analyst at Mintel, Richard Hopping, said: ‘The average amount of time that Brits report spending cleaning their home each week has fallen by half an hour in recent years.’ Mintel found that almost two in three – 62per cent – of the nation say they clean when they have the time. Just one in three have a schedule. Just over four in ten – 42per cent – say their aim is to do the job as quickly as humanly possible. Mr Hopping said: ‘The busy lives of today’s consumers often get in the way of cleaning routines, which means that the majority clean when they have time rather than pre-planning in advance.’ Share or comment on this article 167", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T07:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:38:13.893+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
