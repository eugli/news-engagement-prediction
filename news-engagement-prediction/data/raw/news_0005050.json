The discussion grew heated when Turnbull questioned whether Trump would honor an agreement struck by former President Obama that would allow 1,250 refugees, mostly from the Middle East, into the U.S. from the Australian centers where they currently reside, the Washington Post reported .\nLamenting the political heat he could take for backing out of the agreement, Trump reportedly described it as \"the worst deal ever\" on the phone with Turnbull.\nWhite House press secretary Sean Spicer said Tuesday that the deal would proceed, although he noted the refugees in question would need to pass a thorough screening process before they could enter the U.S.\n\"There will be extreme vetting applied to all of them as part and parcel of the deal that was made, and it was made by the Obama administration with the full backing of the United States government,\" Spicer said.\nHowever, subesequent reporting suggested the White House sought to walk those comments back after Tuesday's briefing. An administration official told an Australian media outlet that Trump is still weighing whether to honor the agreement, which would be particularly complicated in light of an executive order that temporarily suspended the flow of refugees from several of the countries represented among the refugees being held off the coast of Australia.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Fiery riots roil UC Berkeley after Milo arrives on campus \nViolent protests erupted at the University of California at Berkeley on Wednesday evening after an event featuring an alt right speaker was canceled due to safety concerns after more than 1,000 people showed up outside the campus venue.\nBreitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos was scheduled to address 500 attendees on behalf of the school's Republican club.\n\"Of paramount importance this evening was the campus's commitment to ensure the safety and security of those attending the event, the speaker, those who came to engage in lawful protest, as well as members of the public and the Berkeley campus community,\" the university said in a statement released two hours before the event was slated to begin.\nBy Anna Giaritelli â€¢ 02/01/17 11:04 PM The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday evening.\nThe purported leaks quickly raised questions about which members of Trump's administration had divulged such candid descriptions of sensitive talks to the media, and why. The reports also underscored the challenges that could lie ahead for a president whose unconventional style is an awkward fit for the measured world of diplomacy.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T06:24:16.802+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
