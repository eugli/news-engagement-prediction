Both are recovering at home. \nPolice have appealed for information. Very sore' \nMr Watson, who was left partially disabled after the injury which ended his boxing career, had been travelling along the Ridgeway in Chingford, with his friend Lennard Ballack when the incident happened. \nHis spokesman said: \"Lennard got out to speak to the people in the car behind them. From what I understand, the guys wound down their window and sprayed something in his eyes. \n\"The men then went to the car that Michael was in - he had his seatbelt half off by this point, and they dragged him out the car and along the floor. The men then sprayed Lennard in the eyes again and drove away.\" \nMr Watson's spokesman said they were assuming it was an attempted carjacking and that they were hoping police would catch the people involved. \n\"Lennard's suffering a bit - his eyes are not good,\" he said. \"Michael is OK. I think he is very, very sore though. He got dragged along the road so some of the skin has broken badly.\" Hospital treatment \nThe Metropolitan Police said officers had been called to the scene shortly before 17:00 GMT to reports of attempted robbery. \nA police spokesman said: \"Two men, aged in their 50s, informed officers that they had been sprayed in the face with a suspected noxious substance by two suspects who attempted to steal the car. \n\"The male suspects fled the scene in a different vehicle. \n\"The victims were assessed at the scene by the London Ambulance Service before being taken to an east London hospital for further treatment - their injuries are not life-threatening.\" \nMr Watson spent 40 days in a coma and had six brain operations after a WBO super-middleweight bout against Mr Eubank. \nIn 2003, he completed the London Marathon over six days, defying doctors' predictions that he would never walk again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:53:19.125+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
