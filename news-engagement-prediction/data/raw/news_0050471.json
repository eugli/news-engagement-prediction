Our collaboration with Beit Al Khair Society demonstrates our full support to President His Highness Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan’s initiative of making 2017 the Year of Giving, and builds on our nation’s legacy of generosity. Private sector partnership and cooperation form a key pillar of the Year of Giving initiative and we are confident that our participation will help effect positive change for those in need.”\nAbdeen Taher Al Awadi, general manager of Beit Al Khair, said the Food for All truck will move across the various emirates to distribute light meals for blue-collar workers, “with the objective to support and encourage this important segment of our society”.\n“This is the first of many such programmes that will be witnessed through 2017, in accordance with the Year of Giving initiative announced by Shaikh Khalifa. Food distribution for the needy has been one of the key projects at Beit Al Khair, and we have spent about Dh77 million on this project over the last four years,” Al Awadi said.\nThe food distribution by Emirates Islamic continues its partnership with Beit Al Khair Society.\nLast year, the bank donated Dh1 million to Beit Al Khair Society as part of Emirates Islamic Charity Fund’s annual Ramadan campaign to provide financial aid under several main areas, including food, shelter, health, education and social welfare.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T13:12:44.584+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
