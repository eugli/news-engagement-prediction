We'll provide more info as soon as it's available. Thanks for your patience.\" \nIn a statement Telstra apologised to its customers and said the company had \"worked as quickly as possible\" to restore services within two hours. \n\"We have more than 40,000 kilometres of fibre, 5,000 exchange buildings, more than 9,000 mobile towers,\" Telstra chief executive officer Andrew Penn said. \n\"You can never guarantee these things, it's a large complex network. \n\"Physical assets are susceptible, they do get damaged.\" \nThe impact of the outages were far reaching, with Jetstar reporting that nine flights across the country had been disrupted after the network outage caused problems with the airline's check-in service. \nBuses were also deployed to replace train services on the NSW Hunter line which had also been affected. \nTelstra said the fire at the exchange was contained quickly and an investigation was now underway into how it started. \n\"It's extraordinarily unusual, I've never known that to happen before,\" Mr Penn said. \n\"Obviously in situations where there's a serious fire, then I guess it's hard to predict how that impacts technology. \n\"That's obviously something we need to do an investigation on.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-02T18:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T14:08:02.426+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
