Photo: Brendan Esposito \n\"Santos has recently made it clear they have little interest in developing the project and have instead spun it off into a separate entity, ready for sale,\" Mr Buckingham said. \n\"The government should not allow Santos to jerk people around, waste their time and create uncertainty just to fatten up the project for the stock market.\" \nFairfax Media sought comment from Santos. It is understood that the venture - which is 80 per cent owned by the company and 20 per cent by EnergyAustralia - could make it off the \"non-core\" list if its prospects improve. \nEnergyAustralia has written down the value of its share to zero worth. \nAlthough the company revealed it had made the lodgement, details of the application and the EIS may not be made public for several weeks, leaving the local community in the dark as to the expected impacts. \nMike Young, director of resource assessments in the NSW Department of Planning and Environment, said in a statement his department \"assesses all applications on their merits under planning legislation and clear NSW government policies and guidelines\". \n\"The department will be consulting broadly on this application, including holding public information sessions in the local area during the exhibition period,\" Mr Young said. \nFairfax Media sought comment from Anthony Roberts, the new Planning Minister in Premier Gladys Berejiklian's new government. Before the changes last month, Mr Roberts was the resources minister \n\"As resources minister, Anthony Roberts was rabidly pro-gas, but now that he is planning minister he must ensure that the environmental and social impacts of the project are properly valued,\" Mr Buckingham said. \nNaomi Hodgson, campaign manager at the Wilderness Society, said concerns about the impacts of drilling as many as 1000 coal seam gas wells as originally planned had been fanned by a \"long tragic history of failure\" so far. \nMs Hodgson said there had been \"at least 20 toxic coal seam gas waste water spills, including the contamination of an aquifer with uranium and other toxic heavy metals\". \n\"Those spills came from just 20 wells and Santos now wants approval to drill hundreds of CSG wells through the recharge aquifers of the Great Artesian Basin, an essential water source for outback Australia,\" she said. \nSantos, though, said its EIS \"includes extensive studies and modelling on the environment in the project area, including on water, flora, fauna, soil, noise, air quality and cultural heritage\". \n\"Santos has drawn upon more than 13,000 hours of on-ground environmental surveys, carried out by environmental scientists,\" the company said in its statement.
