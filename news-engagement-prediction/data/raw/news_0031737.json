But after reading this, you will certainly be envious of this guy's incredible Ultimate Team pro card. Yes, a number of players have received pro cards in the past, but Bakambu's stands out a mile. \nHis pace, shooting and dribbling stats are just ridiculous, while the ever-important physical stat makes him one of the best ever. \nBakambu tweeted EA Sports yesterday to say thank you for the card. Thank you s much @EASPORTSFIFA for this special card !Can't wait to see what this #Bakagoal can do :zap: @EASPORTSEsp #FIFA17 pic.twitter.com/70dkKJONW3 - CÃ©dric Bakambu (@Bakambu17) February 14, 2017 \nAs people asked whether they could borrow it, Bakumbu is probably smashing everybody left, right and centre with this outstanding UT card. \nAtletico Madrid forward Antoine Griezmann is also one of the lucky few to receive his very own blue 95-rated card, with stats like 96 pace, 95 shooting and 98 dribbling making him one the best cards in the game. \nEA Sports only hand out blue cards to footballers who play the game regularly, with the likes of Luke Shaw, Joey Barton and Jay Rodriguez receiving them in past FIFA's. \nFIFA's strongest player Adebayo Akinfenwa has also received a prestigious blue card. The 34-year-old has stats of 87 pace, 96 shooting and 96 dribbling. Imagine playing with this card: A post shared by Adebayo Akinfenwa (@realakinfenwa) on Oct 25, 2016 at 10:29am PDT \nWhen you look at other pro cards, Bakambu's certainly tops the list. \nImagine how much this is actually worth..
