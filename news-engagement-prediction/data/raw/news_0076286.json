His voice and hair were changing. He fitted in even less than before at a girls' school. \n\"I found myself at a crossroads,\" he says. \"I had to leave the school.\" Image copyright Open Society Foundations Image caption Reaching adolescence, Julius's body changed and remaining at a girls' school became untenable \nVisiting a doctor, he learned that he had a condition where his body \"did not respond to the typical male hormones responsible for typical male body formation and that it was neither a disease nor witchcraft, just a biological condition\". \n\"That information was a relief because then, having become born again, I changed my prayers from deliverance from demons to just healing of an otherwise common condition.\" \nBut with all the physical changes his body had undergone, he could not continue living as a girl. \nJulius left Uganda to continue his studies in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, where under guidance from his doctor he came to a decision. \n\"I made up my mind to discard the female image and start living as the man I was - albeit with all the ambiguity,\" he says. \n\"It was a hard change socially, especially because I was still young but it was also a relief.\" Threats \nWhen he returned to Uganda, it was no longer as Julia, but Julius. \nAt first, Julius pretended to be his \"brother\" but it wasn't long before people saw through the ruse, recognising him as the person who used to be called Julia. Image copyright Open Society Foundations Image caption One day, Julius says his story was leaked to a newspaper in Uganda: \"Everybody wanted a piece of me. They wanted to dissect me.\" \nA little later, a situation that might have been complicated or awkward became dangerous. \nSomeone told a newspaper about him and suddenly, without warning or consent, Julius's private journey became public. \n\"I received threats and a lot of harassing comments in the news,\" he says. \"It is a very disturbing and frightening thing at that age to have everybody give opinions on what they think you are. \n\"You get to believe some of these things. Some of the comments alleged I had a sex change and people like me should be burnt. \n\"That scares a young person to death, and it scared me in ways hard to describe.\" \nJulius credits his Christian faith - the feeling that, with God, he was not alone - for keeping him afloat at this time. Image copyright Open Society Foundations Image caption Julius found work in South Africa as a technical writer for a software company \nBut he had good reason to believe he was not safe in Uganda and left again, this time travelling to South Africa. \nA friend helped him get a technical writing job with a software company, which paid well. \n\"This made it easy for me to be allowed to stay there and kept me psychologically safe for some years,\" he says. Cheered on live TV \nThen one day, flicking through the news, a story caught his attention. The Ugandan media were discussing an intersex boy. \nJulius knew he had to do something. \n\"I was concerned,\" he says. \"I decided to go back home to help him.\" Image copyright Open Society Foundations Image caption Julius received a standing ovation after returning to Uganda and telling his story to an audience on national TV \n\"For him and others like him, I faced my fears in front of a live audience on national TV, and I told my story.\" \nWhen he had finished, the whole room stood and cheered. \nIt was another turn taken. Repressive laws \nNow Julius, who is married with four children, works as a full-time educator in Uganda, as head of intersex health and rights organisation SIPD Uganda. \nHe educates and counsels people about intersex issues, working with community midwives to fight the stigma around intersex babies, advocating for policy change and building capacity and partnerships in the field. Image copyright Open Society Foundations Image caption He now works full-time as an educator on intersex issues \n\"The standard treatment of intersex conditions in Uganda is still, unfortunately, to try to normalise the child as much as possible,\" he says. \n\"This involves deafening silence and isolation and, in worst case scenarios, child murders of the intersex infant. There are also a lot of abandonments on rubbish heaps and in latrines.\" \nThe combination of traditional religious values, pop culture that defines what maleness and femaleness look like, and repressive laws that equate intersex identities with homosexuality (\"and, in some instances, an intersex person can also be gay\") create \"an even more dangerous climate to operate in\", he says. \nAs recently as 2014, Uganda tried to introduce a draconian anti-homosexuality law, which required homosexuals to be jailed for life. It was overturned , but had a chilling effect. \nDespite this, and his own grim assessment, Julius believes his public education work, allied with more sympathetic media coverage, is beginning to shift attitudes. Image copyright Open Society Foundations Image caption Julius now has four children of his own. \nHis own thinking has also continued to develop. \n\"Certainly as I get older, I am now thinking about different kinds of safety, especially for the children and also blackmail that comes from people who feel the need to remind me that I once wore a skirt,\" he says. \n\"That said, I have developed greater resilience with age and even with threats still coming my way now and again, I have more control of my life and how to live it. \n\"Yes, I sometimes feel I can do better with this or other surgery or hormone treatments but it is something to contemplate in light of social expectations - not something I feel I must do to be a normal human being. \n\"There is nothing wrong with me and there is often nothing wrong with most intersex children or people.\" \nThe images in this article were produced for the Open Society Foundations by PositiveNegatives.
