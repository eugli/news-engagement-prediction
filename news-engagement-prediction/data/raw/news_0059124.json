If you'd like to learn more... - Listen \nThe Phoenix Foundation in Calgary and other private schools across the province say an Alberta advocacy group is hurting students by pushing to have the NDP phase out public funding for private schools. \nDiana Stinn, co-founder of the Phoenix Education Foundation told News Talk 770’s Danielle Smith there are approximately 34,000 Alberta students attending independent schools. If funding for private schools is cut, many cash-strapped families would have to enrol their children in public schools. \n“We have heard over the last couple years that there’s not even enough physical seats in public schools to accommodate kids,” Stinn said. \n“You think public schools are crowded now, what happens when 34,000 kids move that direction?” \nREAD MORE: Class sizes continue to grow in Alberta schools \nPublic Interest Alberta told News Talk 770 government funds need to be reallocated in order to help meet NDP campaign promises, which include reducing mandatory school fees and class sizes, as well as increasing classroom supports and introducing a school lunch program. \nPrivate schools in the province received $248 million in government funding in 2016. \nJoel French, the executive director of Public Interest Alberta, said there is no evidence to suggest enrolment numbers in the private school system would decrease if the government cut funding. \n“At the end of the day, almost all of the people who have their kids in private schools right now are going to keep them in private schools – no matter what rate they’re subsidized at,” he said. \n“In fact, you can look back at history in Alberta, at a time when we funded the private schools at 60 per cent. Now, we’ve boosted it to 70 per cent,” he said. “Enrolment hasn’t changed since then.” \n“I don’t think, if those families decide to opt out of the system that we built collectively as a province, that they should try to take money with them out of the system.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T01:26:18.197+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
