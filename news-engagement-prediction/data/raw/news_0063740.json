Though the odds of winning any Powerball prize are 1 in 24.9, the odds of scoring the jackpot are 1 in 292,201,338.\n► $22.6M lottery ticket was sold in west Michigan\nLast November, a group of 20 co-workers in Tennessee claimed a $420.9-million Powerball jackpot.\nPowerball jackpots start at $40 million. The game's second prize for matching the first five numbers but missing the Powerball is $1 million. There were five $1 million prizes — in Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas — from Saturday's drawing. The game also offers a \"power play\" option that can mean larger payoffs for some lower-tier winnings.\nUSA TODAY Network contributed.\nContact Brian Manzullo: bmanzullo@freepress.com.
