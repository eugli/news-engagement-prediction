She completed her all-black ensemble with a furry coat to stay warm and sported a high ponytail for the day. \nWeeks after she found out she was pregnant, Hannah posed for her fifth Sports Illustrated Swimsuit appearance, wearing an itty-bitty bikini while photographed on the beach in Mexico. \nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

KIM (@jeffkkim) on Feb 14, 2017 at 7:26am PST \nTalking to Extra on Tuesday , the model says she is having some pretty intense pregnancy cravings — and the “give me everything!” mentality is in full swing. \n“So I don’t eat meat, but now I crave beef jerky all the time, which is kind of interesting,” she said. “I like a lot of gummies, like candy and stuff like that … anything salty, sweet.” \nAbout the possibility of expanding their family even further, Hannah admits that she has big plans for their future but for now she’s trying to relish the present. \n“I want a team. Let’s just get through one and we’ll see how I feel,” she shares. “A couple maybe … three or four.” \nRELATED VIDEO: Hannah Davis Jeter Poses for SI Swimsuit 2017 Shoot in Tulum, Mexico \n\nHannah revealed that the couple was expecting a baby girl Monday in an essay for The Players’ Tribune . “Pregnant with our first child, Derek and I are looking to the future,” wrote the mom-to-be. \nIn the piece, which included a photo of Derek holding a bouquet of pink balloons, the model shared that the New York Yankees legend, 42, already has a name picked out for their baby — however, she’s not set on it just yet. \n“He’ll say when he calls me during the day: ‘So, how are you and so-and-so doing?’” she continues, adding that she reminds him, ”‘That’s not the name yet, sweetie.’ Whatever her name is, I know she’ll run circles around him.” \nTalking to Extra about choosing a name, Hannah added, “I think I’m emotional right now, so I can’t decide. I don’t know what I like. I think I hate everything, so I’m not there yet. Maybe towards the end I’ll get there, but for now I’m not brainstorming, I’m just trying to keep healthy and not sick.” Show Full Article", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T02:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T21:04:53.134+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
