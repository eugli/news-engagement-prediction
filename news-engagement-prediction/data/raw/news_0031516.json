By the end of the night, Adele had claimed all three prizes, but a chorus of voices objected that Beyoncé had been robbed — and the loudest such voice was Adele herself. \nAnointed as the winner of album of the year for 25 , Adele hesitated to accept the honor and dedicated her victory to Beyoncé . “I’m very humbled and I’m very grateful and gracious,” the British singer said, “but my artist of my life is Beyoncé and this album to me, the Lemonade album, was just so monumental, Beyoncé. It was so monumental and so well thought-out and so beautiful and soul-baring, and we all got to see another side to you that you don’t always let us see, and we appreciate that. And all us artists here adore you. You are our light!” \nThe unexpected moment became a hot topic among celebrities on social media, with many agreeing that Beyoncé had been snubbed. Solange Knowles, Beyoncé’s sister, tweeted a link to Frank Ocean’s recent Grammy takedown and added, “wuddup frank.” (In his piece, which was posted Saturday night, the rapper criticized Taylor Swift’s victory over Kendrick Lamar in the album of the year category at last year’s Grammys.) \nOthers praised Adele’s speech as classy, and still others joked that she “ did the Kanye West to herself.” Check out some reactions below. \n— solange knowles (@solangeknowles) February 13, 2017 Off to bed… #Lemonade is life and it still grows. All love and praise to @Beyonce ❤ \n— Gabrielle Union (@itsgabrielleu) February 13, 2017 Adele just did the Kanye West to herself –\"imma let me finish…but Beyoncé\" 😭😭😭 \n— Talib Kweli Greene (@TalibKweli) February 13, 2017 Adele gives it up to Beyoncé. Women are so wonderful. \n— Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) February 13, 2017 I appreciate Adele, her work & her acknowledgement of how truly once-in-a-lifetime Beyonce's LEMONADE is, especially to black women. 🙌🏾✊🏾🍋 \n— Janet Mock (@janetmock) February 13, 2017 Even Adele knows Beyonce should have won 💓💓💓 \n— Michelle Collins (@michcoll) February 13, 2017 Adele is the GOAT for giving up AOTY. You can't stop a movement. Lemonade is a movement. \n— Akilah Hughes (@AkilahObviously) February 13, 2017 ADELE IS WOKE I’M SCREAMING \n— Amanda Seales 🇬🇩 (@amandaseales) February 13, 2017 I loved Adele's \"25\" but LEMONADE shoulda won Album of the Year. #GRAMMYs \n— Awesomely Luvvie (@Luvvie) February 13, 2017 Wow. What a sweep. Congratulations @Adele and of course the incredible @Beyonce . #GRAMMYs \n— Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) February 13, 2017 ADELE IS CLASS. Beyoncé is the artist of our generation. \n— Kevin McHale (@druidDUDE) February 13, 2017 Adele is basically apologizing to Beyonce for winning. That's extremely classy. \n— Jemele Hill (@jemelehill) February 13, 2017 For those of you feeling that uncomfortable mix of \"I love Adele\" and \"Beyoncé was robbed,\" you're not crazy. #GRAMMYs https://t.co/sG5Q9VWDyO \n— Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) February 13, 2017 Beyoncé really did deserve it.
