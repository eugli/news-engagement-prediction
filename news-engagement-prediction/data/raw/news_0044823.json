But a new video from Disney reveals that Moana has even more secrets to discover — including several that come all the way from Agrabah. \nMoana directors Ron Clements and John Musker also helmed Aladdin, and apparently, they snuck in several references to the beloved 1992 tale. First up is the Genie’s lamp, which can be seen on the back of Tamatoa the treasure-hoarding crab. There’s also an appearance by Aladdin’s magic carpet (although it doesn’t look like Moana ’s version can fly). \nClements and Musker also continued their tradition of including themselves in their films . In the past, the pair have popped up in Aladdin and Hercules, and here, they show up in two unexpected places. \nWatch the video above to check out all of the Moana / Aladdin connections, and head here to see EW’s rundown of the other Disney Easter eggs hidden in Moana.
