While top Republicans have refused to disavow his charges of election fraud, they have not pushed for action on the issue, which remains a low priority for the congressional leadership.\nThe vote in the House administration committee underscored, once again, the political differences between the Republican president and the party’s rank-and-file. The GOP majority on the committee eliminated the Election Assistance Commission, which was created by Congress after the 2000 Florida recount to upgrade voting technology and provide election-related information to federal entities, state officials and election administrators. \nRepublicans, who lead the effort to terminate the agency, say it is a prime example of government waste. They have been introducing legislation to end the commission for years with little success. \n“If we’re looking at reducing the size of government, this is a perfect example of something that can be eliminated,” said Representative Gregg Harper, the committee chairman, after the bill passed on a 6-3 vote. “We don’t need fluff.” \nHarper said he had not spoken to Trump about the legislation. “He’s certainly welcome to call me at any time,” he said. \nThe bill was opposed by committee Democrats and voting rights groups, who argued that the federal agency played a vital role in protecting elections from hacking and other types of interference. \n“At a time when the vast majority of the country’s voting machines are outdated and in need of replacement, and after an election in which foreign criminals already tried to hack state voter registration systems, eliminating the EAC poses a risky and irresponsible threat to our election infrastructure,” said Wendy Weiser, the democracy program director at the Brennan Center for Justice. \nCongress allotted nearly $3.3bn to states and territories to support upgrading voting systems, and much of that money was placed into bank accounts where it gained interest. As of October 2015, the most recent date available, nearly $376m remained unspent in dozens of states across the country. \nAs of today, the commission’s independent inspector general has not released audit reports for nine of a total of 55 states and territories, according to the EAC. \n“Each day we hear from state and local election officials who need our help to navigate the challenges they face,” said the EAC chair, Thomas Hicks, in a statement. “We are focused on serving them and the American voters. Congress should remain a trusted partner in that effort.” \nThe committee also voted to terminate the public financing system, which provides major party presidential nominees with a lump sum grant of roughly $94.14m in the general election. But a candidate who accepts the grant may not raise any additional funds and is severely limited in how much of his own money he can give or lend to his campaign. \nBarack Obama in effect ended the practice of candidates taking general election public financing in 2008, when he chose not to accept it. His Republican rival, John McCain, took the grant that year and was swamped by the Obama campaign’s spending. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Trump accepted public financing last year. \nMoney for the public financing of campaigns is collected through voluntary $3 checkoffs on taxpayers’ returns. The checkoffs do not affect how much money a taxpayer owes. \nThe legislation would devote $63m of the available funds to pediatric cancer research. The remainder would be returned to the treasury for deficit reduction. \nIt is not clear if the full House will vote on the measures.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T00:22:18.336+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
