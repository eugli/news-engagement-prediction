He won't identify the pair or the price tag. They've already paid a \"significant\" deposit, he noted. \nMr Musk said SpaceX is on track to launch astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA in mid-2018. This moon mission would follow about six months later, by the end of the year under the current schedule, using a Dragon crew capsule and a Falcon heavy rocket. \nThe moon mission is designed to be autonomous — unless something goes wrong, Mr Musk said. \nDrone captures SpaceX rocket landing in Florida \"I think they are entering this with their eyes open, knowing that there is some risk here,\" Mr Musk told reporters in a telephone news conference, a day after teasing via Twitter that an announcement of some sort was forthcoming. \n\"They're certainly not naive, and we'll do everything we can to minimise that risk, but it's not zero. But they're coming into this with their eyes open,\" said Mr Musk, adding that the pair will receive \"extensive\" training before the flight. \nMr Musk said he does not have permission to release the passengers' names, and he was hesitant to even say if they were men, women or even pilots. He would only admit, \"It's nobody from Hollywood.\" \nThe passengers would make a long loop around the moon, skimming the lunar surface and then going well beyond, perhaps 300,000 or 400,000 miles distance altogether. The mission won't involve a lunar landing, according to Mr Musk. \nIt's about 240,000 miles to the moon alone, one way. \nThe most incredible space images of Earth 30 show all The most incredible space images of Earth 1/30 Striking Africa Explore ESA astronaut Tim Peake's stunning photos of Earth, taken from the International Space Station during his six month mission (captions by Tom Peake)\n\r \"The striking colour and texture of Africa Illizi, Algeria\"\n2/30 Favourite Reef \"Every day spent living in space is a great day, but today was particularly special.

The space agency learned of his plan at the same time as reporters, and was busy preparing a statement following the announcement. \n\"This should be a really exciting mission that hopefully gets the world really excited about sending people into deep space again,\" he said. \nRead more SpaceX successfully launches and lands rocket after explosion SpaceX to resume space launches after mysterious rocket explosion SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket may have been sabotaged Full scale of SpaceX explosion's destruction revealed The crew Dragon capsule has not yet flown in space. Neither has a Falcon Heavy rocket, which is essentially a Falcon 9 rocket with two strap-on boosters, according to Mr Musk. He said there will be ample time to test both the spacecraft and the rocket, before the moon mission. \nMr Musk expects to have more moon-mission customers as time goes by. \nJust late last week, NASA announced it was studying the possibility of adding crew to the test flight of its megarocket, at the request of the Trump administration. Such a flight to the lunar neighborhood wouldn't happen before 2019 at best — if, indeed, that option is even implemented. \nMr Musk said anything that advances the space exploration cause is good, no matter who goes first. \n\"This should be incredibly exciting,\" he said. \nSpaceX is also working on a so-called Red Dragon, meant to fly to Mars around 2020 with experiments, but no people — and actually land. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T01:53:39.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
