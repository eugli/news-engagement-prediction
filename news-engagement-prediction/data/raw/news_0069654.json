It's ICE's responsibility to pick these individuals up, and they are not doing their job.”\nMCSO spokesman Mark Casey A Sheriff’s Office spokesman said that ICE agents were not allowed to arrest detainees within the confines of the jail facilities, citing liability and litigation concerns. But spokesman Mark Casey said, \"They've made absolutely no effort to pick people up, even though they've been notified. It's ICE's responsibility to pick these individuals up, and they are not doing their job.\"\nAll 32 were arrested on suspicion of state crimes and during an ICE screening process in the jails were deemed to likely be in the country illegally. Per Penzone's new policy, they were released from custody at the time a criminal judge saw fit, just as if they were U.S. citizens.\nICE spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O'Keefe said as a result of changes at the jails, ICE officials \"realigned fugitive enforcement resources\" to locate and arrest people after their release.\nAs of Wednesday morning, Pitts O'Keefe said, five of the 32 released from jail have been arrested by ICE's Enforcement Removal Operations.\nAmong the individuals released were some with convictions for extreme DUI, reckless driving, drug offenses and resisting an officer, Pitts O'Keefe said.\n\"ICE will continue to seek to collaborate with all law enforcement agencies throughout the state of Arizona, including the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, to help ensure that individuals who may pose a threat to our communities are not released onto the street to potentially reoffend and harm individuals living within our communities,\" she said.\n“ICE will continue to seek to collaborate with all law enforcement agencies throughout the state of Arizona, including the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, to help ensure that individuals who may pose a threat to our communities are not released onto the street to potentially reoffend and harm individuals living within our communities.”\nICE spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O'Keefe RELATED: ICE calls new MCSO jail policy a 'dangerous change,' but judges across U.S are ruling against immigration detainers \nCasey said Tuesday the agency has lived up to its promise to notify ICE when one of its would-be detainees is about to be freed, but ICE has declined to pick any of them up upon release.\nOn Tuesday, the Sheriff's Office said there were 26 such individuals released, and on Wednesday ICE said there were 32.\nPenzone said Friday that a threat of litigation prompted him to end the “courtesy holds,” and that the new policy would take effect immediately.\nEach person booked into jail in Maricopa County is screened by an ICE agent, who flags certain individuals if they are suspected to be illegal immigrants. Before Friday, the holds, or “detainers,” as they’re officially known, could keep an individual in jail for up to 48 hours longer than they would have otherwise after being released by the court.\nPenzone said the ICE agents would remain in the jails and still screen the inmates. The changes now come on the back end, he said, and require ICE to take a more “aggressive position” upon an inmate's release.\nCasey said Penzone has initiated discussions with ICE on “working out a lawful, logistical exchange.”\nTrump actions on immigration How many Mexicans cross illegally?

The memos, among other things, empower local police to help with immigration enforcement; call for hiring thousands more immigration agents; and expands the definition of immigrants who could be deported under \"expedited removal,\" which can deny individuals the opportunity to speak with a judge.\nREAD MORE: \n'We have laws': Trump supporters in Arizona cheer new guidelines on deportation\nMigrants on Trump immigration guidelines: 'What came out today is scary'\nTrump spares 'dreamers,' who see their situation as 'more fragile than ever'", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T04:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T00:27:59.100+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
