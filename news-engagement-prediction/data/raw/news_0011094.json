He won’t celebrate 13 of his 14 wrestlers advancing to semistate next weekend. \nAs far as Schoettle is concerned, the Falcons turned in an unacceptable performance on their home mats after sending 10 wrestlers to regional finals matches, but finishing just 4-6 in title-deciding bouts. \n“I thought this was one of the worst performances in regional in Perry Meridian history and that’s the honest truth,” said Schoettle, the second-year Falcons coach. “We didn’t bring it, and that’s my fault. They weren’t prepared like they should have been. That’s on me.” \nFreshman Brayden Lowery (40-2) got the Falcons off to a vibrant start, winning his 106-pound finals match over Franklin Central’s Josh Vaughn with a pin in the first 34 seconds. He controlled the mat from the starting whistle, seeming to embody the expectations for the Perry Meridian program. \nBut in three matches in a row — at 132, 138 and 145 — the Falcons were beaten, twice in overtime. Noah Warren (152) and Christian Warren (160) logged strong wins to give Perry Meridian an edge with three title wins, while Jalen Allen pinned Roncalli’s Sam Hansen to make it four, but the excitement ended there. \nBy most standards, Perry Meridian turned in a quality performance for a program with more than a dozen sectional and regional team titles, adding three third-place finishes in addition to four wins and six runner-ups. \n“Here’s the thing: Sometimes you get beat because the guy’s a little bit better, and we lost some of those today,” Schoettle said. “But we lost a lot of matches where we had beaten guys already in the year or that I know just from my experience that we’re good, if not better. And we got beat in those matches. \n“That’s all I’ll think about tonight. I don’t care that we won the regional. It’s the guys that didn’t perform. That’s on me, though. That’s my fault.” Buy Photo \nTristen Tonte of Warren Central, pulls down Dakari Kenney of Pike, at 195 pounds, IHSAA Wrestling Regional, from Perry Meridian High School, February 4, 2017. (Photo: Robert Scheer/IndyStar) \nSeven different teams won title matches on the afternoon, including Warren Central with two-time state runner-up Tristen Tonte. \nTonte claimed his 32nd win of the season when he pinned Pike’s Dakari Kenney in an all-around stifling performance at 195 pounds that advances him on his quest for a state title. \n“My approach to it is very different this year,” said Tonte, who underwent surgery to repair his deviated septum following the Warriors’ loss in the Class 6A football state championship. “It is a big deal because it’s my last go-around, but more than I’ve come so close. I’m really just ready to get it done.” \nWarren Central finished third in Saturday's regional behind Roncalli. Greenfield-Central finished fourth and Beech Grove finished fifth. Despite finishing 10th as a team, Speedway boasted a regional champion with senior Jaden Powell (18-3) at 285 over Perry Meridian senior Steve Woolbright. Around the area \nAt Pendleton Heights: Cathedral’s state tournament dominance carried over well into regional action, where the Irish posted six champions and finished more than 100 points over the rest of the field. Frankton finished second while North Central finished third, nabbing two individual titles. \nNoblesville finished fourth overall, crowning two regional champions. Senior Nick Brady won a 15-6 major decision over Cathedral freshman Caleb Oliver. Millers senior David Kitko also won a 7-2 decision over James Despain of Lawrence North. \nAt Mooresville: For the second time in as many weeks, No. 1 Brownsburg beat out No. 3 Avon and won back-to-back regional titles. \nAll four of the Bulldogs’ top-ranked wrestlers retained their momentum and won out through Saturday's regional.
