IAF man kills colleague over affair with wife, cuts body into 16 pieces; stores them in polythene bags By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Wednesday, February 22, 2017 - 12:25 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nBathinda: In a ghastly incident, an Indian Air Force (IAF) corporal was killed and his body hacked to pieces by a colleague over his alleged affair with the latter's wife. \nThe victim, Vipin Shukla (27), a corporal in the Air Force Wives Welfare Association Canteen, belonged to Gonda, Uttar Pradesh. \nShukla was posted at Bhisiana air base, near Bathinda, in Punjab. \nAs per The Times of India , Sergeant Sulesh Kumar, who also hailed from UP, his wife Anuradha Patel and brother-in-law Shashi Bhushan murdered the corporal on February 8 night. \nHowever, the Punjab Police found the chopped-up body of the missing Air Force employee from the residence of Kumar on Tuesday. \nKumar and Anuradha have been arrested; however, Shashi Bhushan, who works in the Merchant Navy, is absconding. \nCorporal Shukla's wife Kumkum had filed a missing complaint of her husband at Balluana police post on February 9. \nAs per Bathinda SSP Swapan Sharma, the sniffer dogs led them to Kumar's house, from where they recovered Shukla's body parts packed in 16 plastic bags and stuffed in an almirah and refrigerator in the house. \nShukla, who joined the Air Force in 2009, was posted at the Bhisiana Air Force station in May 2014. \nHe joined the duty without his wife and soon got involved with Anuradha and impregnated her. \nAddressing a press conference, superintendent of police (traffic), Gurmeet Singh, said, “(After discovering she was pregnant,) Anuradha asked Vipin to marry her but he refused. He had also been spreading details of their relationship among other employees. Thus, Anuradha, with her husband and brother hatched a conspiracy to murder Vipin for revenge.” \n“On the evening of February 8, Sulesh called Vipin to help him pack as he was to change his quarters, then attacked him with an axe, killing him. He then packed Vipin’s body in a box and took it to his new quarters”. \n“On February 19, Sulesh cut the body into pieces with a meat knife and packed it in 16 polythene bags. He put some in the wardrobe and the others in the refrigerator,” he added. \nA case under Section 302 (murder) has been registered against the accused.
