Musk had earlier announced his plans to enter the Indian market post the launch of Model 3 last year. At an earlier occasion, following PM Narendra Modi's visit to Tesla's Silicon Valley factory, Musk had also mooted the idea of setting up a battery plant in India. But what cannot be contended is the auto giant's interest in the Indian market. \n\nRoad ahead \nThis should not come as a surprise. According to the Society of Indian Automotive Manufacturers (SIAM), India's automotive sector is worth $74 billion today and is expected to achieve a turnover of $300 billion by 2026. At the current rate, the industry is poised to become the third-largest auto market by the end of the current fiscal. \n\nThis comes at a good time for the Indian market too, with the government's increased focus on digitisation and its ultimate aim to be a 100% electric vehicle nation by 2030. In fact, it is currently working on a scheme to provide electric cars on zero down payment. \n\nAt an event organised by CII Young India last year, Power Minister Piyush Goyal had said that \"India can become the first country of its size which will run 100& of electric vehicles. We are trying to make this programme self-financing.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T19:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T10:01:53.809+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
