That is a legislated target that effectively provides a subsidy to wind and solar power … and that was an important policy because it was developed at time when this emerging industry across the world effectively needed subsidy support to become cost competitive. It's why 173 nations across the world have these RETs'. \n'By the 2020 though, this technology on all the modelling will be able to stand on its own two feet, compete in the market without subsidy from government or without subsidy effectively from consumers through a government legislated scheme, providing that there is a proper policy framework that gives investors a long term price investment signal that is compliant with our carbon pollution reduction efforts'. \nMr Butler said Labor would provide that long term price investment signal through an emissions intensity scheme 'that’s aligned with our emission reduction targets, which will required in my very clear view about half of our electricity by 2030 will be zero emissions'. \nMr Butler said the emissions intensity scheme was the most cost effective way to replace aging electricity infrastructure, quoting the Energy Markets Commission that it would be $15 billion cheaper than the current policy 'which is to effectively muddle on, cross our fingers and hope that as these plants continue to shut down in a very disorderly fashion someone’s going to build a replacement plant. This is a very dangerous game the government is playing'.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T02:24:13.066+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
