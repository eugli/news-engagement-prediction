If Facebook feels it can make its content free (with income coming from advertising), then it could give subscriber services like Netflix and Amazon Prime serious pause for thought. \nThe announcement by the social media giant was made together with several other news about the company's video features. \nVideos will now autoplay sound in the news feed and will be displayed in full, even if they are vertical.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T09:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T05:29:09.347+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
