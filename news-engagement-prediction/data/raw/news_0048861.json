Media speculation about the sale began on 10 February, Restaurant Brands said in a statement . \nDaniel Schwartz, the chief executive of Restaurant Brands, said: \"We look forward to taking an already very strong brand and accelerating its pace of growth and opening new restaurants in the US and around the world.\" \nRestaurant Brands was formed in 2014, when 3G Capital-backed Burger King acquired Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons for $11bn. \nThe fast food giant said it would pay for the Popeyes deal with \"cash in hand\" and financing from JP Morgan and Wells Fargo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T19:55:38.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
