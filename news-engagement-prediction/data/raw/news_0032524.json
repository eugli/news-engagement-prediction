Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA teenager has brought people to tears with a piece of art on sexual assault created for a university project. \nEmma Krenzer, 19, is a student at Nebraska Wesleyan University and was asked to create \"some sort of map\". \nWhile this might immediately conjure up images of countries, towns, rivers and other geographical landmarks, Emma decided to create a map of human touch on the human body. \nThe student took a photograph of a friend before printing out a life-size copy and then finger painting over the top of it, including a key at the bottom to explain where the touches came from. (Photo: @cheezitfan1 /Twitter) \nKrenzer used different colours of paint to represent touches from different people - purple or blue for parents, green or yellow for siblings and friends, orange for lovers and red for \"someone I told no\". (Photo: Twitter/synthetic watermelon) \nThe powerful piece shows the affectionate touches you would receive from a mum - maybe a swirl on the stomach, a brush on the forearm. \nBut red paint dominates in the areas over the breasts and genitals, showing the devastating impact and violation of sexual assault. (Photo: Twitter/synthetic watermelon) \nWhen Emma shared photographs of her artwork on Twitter, it was retweeted more than 135,000 times and racked up a further 312,000 likes. \nOne person commented: \"When i read what the red areas were my mouth dropped. This really is an amazing work of art, makes you think&appreciate.\" \nOthers said they were thinking about the artwork \"all day\". \nKrenzer told BuzzFeed: “Some people told me they burst into tears after viewing the piece and others thanked me repeatedly for creating it. I really don’t have the words to describe how it makes me feel.\" \nShe also said that she is going to continue with this work and do a series. \nIf you have been a victim of sexual assault or would like advice there is a wealth of information, including charities you can contact, on the Victim Support website .
