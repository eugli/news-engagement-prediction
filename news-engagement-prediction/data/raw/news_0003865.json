As leader of the NEC, the former Goldman senior exec will help frame the debate on the biggest economic issues and act as the president's quarterback on the economy and coordinate policymaking between various agencies and programs. \nSome of that policymaking will undoubtedly involve Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs. Just this week Trump pledged this week to \"do a big number\" on the Wall Street reform law known as Dodd-Frank. Trump is expected to sign an executive order on Friday directing his administration to evaluate financial regulation imposed by Obama. \nAfter 25 years of building Goldman Sachs into a powerhouse, Cohn stepped down last year from the firm. \nGoldman agreed to give Cohn a chunk of that $285 million fortune ahead of schedule in order to sever ties with the firm. For instance, Goldman paid Cohn $65 million in cash in exchange for stock awards that he earned in recent years. Normally, that stock would be tied up for several years. \nRelated: Trump pledges to 'do a big number' on Dodd-Frank \nEthics experts said they believe Cohn's exit qualifies as \"extraordinary payment.\" Federal regulations require government officials who receive that kind of a payment in excess of $10,000 to recuse themselves. \nWarren also raised concerns about how much Cohn will pay in taxes related to that fortune. Political appointees who sell assets to avoid conflicts can request permission to delay paying capital gain taxes on those sales. \nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment, but representatives have previously defended Cohn's handling of his exit from Goldman. \nCohn \"followed all necessary rules and regulations\" to join the Trump administration and won't receive a salary in his new role, White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom previously told CNNMoney. \nGoldman has also said that the only reason it accelerated delivery of Cohn's shares was to allow him to comply with conflict of interest rules that were established by the federal government. \nWarren and Baldwin stressed that they \"do not begrudge\" the salary and bonuses that Cohn earned over the years, making him a \"fabulously wealthy man.\" \n\"But serving the public in the White House is a privilege, and it requires leaders who can guarantee they will be impartial,\" the senators wrote.   3, 2017: 10:12 AM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T22:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T17:36:31.729+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
