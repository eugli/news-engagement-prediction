It wants local people to tell them whether they think that's a good idea or not.\nThe idea is that the plans would help tackle childhood obesity. Credit: ITV News Anglia Experts say children who struggle with their weight are more likely to be overweight or obese when they grow up.\nFigures show two thirds of adults are carrying too much weight. The ban - which would not affect existing outlets - will be discussed at the next full council meeting.\n\"We want to do all we can to encourage young people eat healthily. Research shows that where hot food takeaways are situated very close to school, young people will use them regularly.\nâ€“ Milton Keynes Council Last updated Mon 27 Feb 2017 Health Milton Keynes", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T01:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T00:46:56.909+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
