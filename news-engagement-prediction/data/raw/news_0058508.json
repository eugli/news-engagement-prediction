Now, Mills is set to play under Kohli in the Indian Premier League. (AUCTIONHIGHLIGHTS) \nFor someone who started playing cricket seriously at only 14, Mills’ rise has been phenomenal. Born in Yorkshire, he played for Essex at 19 before making it to the England Lions setup. A career in journalism awaited him but he left the course at University of East London to concentrate on his cricket. \nRead more | Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan, Mohammad Nabi overjoyed after IPL 2017 auction \nMills is probably one of those born to bowl fast. So when he started breaking the 90mph mark regularly, there were calls for him to be included in the England squad for the 2013-14 Ashes. A congenital back condition however cropped up. Since his spinal cord is located too close to the vertebrae, too much workload could cause serious pain. Seriously crazy morning! Thank you for all the messages, can't wait to join up with everyone at @RCBTweets #PlayBold https://t.co/ew03SkZWAm — Tymal Mills (@tmills15) February 20, 2017 \nVery soon it was clear Mills would only be able to play shorter forms of the game. Despite the risk of injury, Mills wasn’t ready to cut down on his pace since that made him stand out from the pack. Still 24, the left-arm pacer has already played for Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash, Chittagong Vikings in the Bangladesh Premier League and Quetta Gladiators in Pakistan Super League. \nRead more | IPL auction: Ben Stokes goes for record Rs14.5 cr to Rising Pune Supergiants \nBeing bought for a cool Rs. 12 crore, 24 times his base price, in the IPL should be a turning point in Mills’ career. The pressure of playing seven home matches at one of the smallest grounds in the world, along with adjusting to the heat of April-May and a stifling schedule should make this a unique experience for Mills. \nIf Royal Challengers Bangalore manages his workload smartly, Mills can turn out to be a star of this IPL. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T01:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T06:13:15.031+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
