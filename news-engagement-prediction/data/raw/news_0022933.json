Formal proceedings will begin in late March. \nHis lawyer said he had also been charged with violating the cyber crime law for sharing the link. \n\"He is still in good spirits and will fight,\" his lawyer Krisadang Nacharut told AFP news agency. He has denied both charges. \nMr Jatupat, who has been involved in anti-government protests in the past, could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted. \nHe is thought to be the first person charged with lese-majeste since King Vajiralongkorn, 64, officially became monarch. \nKing Vajiralongkorn's father, the revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej, died on 13 October at the age of 88 after seven decades on the throne.
