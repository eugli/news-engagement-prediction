We found somebody who will pay us.'\" \nLagerfeld told the magazine, \"A genius actress, but cheapness also, no?\" Photos \nOscars 2017 Red Carpet Arrivals \nHe later clarified his comments in another statement to the publication, saying, \"Chanel engaged in conversations with Ms. Streep's stylist, on her request, to design a dress for her to wear to the Academy Awards. After an informal conversation, I misunderstood that Ms. Streep may have chosen another designer due to remuneration, which Ms. Streep's team has confirmed is not the case. I regret this controversy and wish Ms. Streep well with her 20th Academy Award nomination.\" \nHowever, Streep did not feel that was any kind of apology. \nIn a statement to E! News, she said, \"In reference to Mr. Lagerfeld's 'statement,' there is no 'controversy': Karl Lagerfeld, a prominent designer, defamed me, my stylist, and the illustrious designer whose dress I chose to wear, in an important industry publication.\" \nHer statement continued, \"That publication printed this defamation, unchecked. Subsequently, the story was picked up globally, and continues, globally, to overwhelm my appearance at the Oscars, on the occasion of my record breaking 20th nomination, and to eclipse this honor in the eyes of the media, my colleagues and the audience. I do not take this lightly, and Mr. Lagerfeld's generic 'statement' of regret for this 'controversy' was not an apology. He lied, they printed the lie, and I am still waiting.\"   Meryl Streep , Karl Lagerfeld , 2017 Oscars , Oscars , Feuds , Top Stories Additional  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T08:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T04:04:27.216+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
