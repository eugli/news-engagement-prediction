The photo shows actor Alden Ehrenreich, who won the hotly contested role last year, sitting at the wheel of the Millennium Falcon, along with cast members Woody Harrelson, Atlanta’s Donald Glover, Fleabag’s Phoebe Waller-Bridge , Games of Thrones’ Emilia Clarke , and of course, Han Solo’s partner in crime, Chewbacca (played by Joonas Suotamo). The film’s directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (of The Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street ) also appear in the movie still. A look at the cast alone is already enough of a reason to start counting the days until the movie’s May 25, 2018 premiere. Can’t wait that long? At least you can comfort yourself by knowing The Last Jedi Episode VIII will come out this December.
