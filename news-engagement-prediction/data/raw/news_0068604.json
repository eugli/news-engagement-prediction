It's exhilarating in the same way.\"\nAlso, Weber noted, \"If something bad happens, it's very public.\"\nTo see Weber fly, watch the video below.\nIn addition to flying, Weber built his own biplane, and he is currently refurbishing a friend's Corben Junior Ace in his shed in central St. John's.\nWeber has become so absorbed in those projects, that he has taken a year off from the NSO to enrol in the machinist certificate program at the College of the North Atlantic.\nHe said the worlds of the concert stage and the machinist shop may seem far apart, but the attention to detail remains the same.\n\"I love the fact that there's a bunch of guys standing around in coveralls and we've got grease all over, and we're sitting there talking about thousandths of an inch.\"\nFor more What Are You At videos, s ubscribe to the CBCNL YouTube channel.\nDo you have an interesting weekend project or hobby?
