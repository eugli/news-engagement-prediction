(TIZIANA FABI/AFP/Getty Images) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Wednesday, February 22, 2017, 12:42 AM \nROME — Pope Francis is calling for humanitarians to protect refugees fleeing their homelands and denouncing the “populist rhetoric” that is closing doors in their faces. \nIn a speech Tuesday to an international forum on migration and peace, Francis also demanded justice and redress for migrants and the poor who have been exploited by the wealthy. \nHe said the world can no longer sustain “unacceptable economic inequality” that destroys the planet and forces people to leave their homes. \n“One group of individuals cannot control half of the world’s resources. We cannot allow for persons and entire peoples to have a right only to gather the remaining crumbs,” the pontiff said. \nIt’s a theme the world’s first Latin American Pope has emphasized during his four-year papacy, most stridently in his 2015 environmental encyclical.
