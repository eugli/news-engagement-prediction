We should therefore only grant citizenship, and the rights that come with it, to those who have contributed to and assimilated into our society, and who share our values.”\nThe questions include:\nShould there be a law banning female circumcision?\nShould there be a law banning a wife from leaving the home against the wishes of the husband?\nShould there be a law banning adults from homosexual acts and relationships?\nShould there be a law banning blasphemy?\nShould the punishment for killing be reduced if the killer says it was done for family honour?\nWhile the answer to some might seem obvious, others are more nuanced.\nFor example, last month it was revealed the Grand Mufti of Australia Ibrahim Abu Mohammed made a submission to a parliamentary inquiry that the controversial Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act should be “strengthened” to prohibit religious vilification of Muslims and other believers.\nVictorian Liberal Senator James Paterson told The Australian at the time: “Effectively that would mean Australia has a national blasphemy law because criticising someone’s religious beliefs in a way that offended them could breach the law.”\nSenator Leyonhjelm also proposed that welfare should be reserved for citizens only, meaning that only those who passed the test could receive welfare payments.\n“Raising the bar on citizenship would lead to Australians being more accepting of immigration, particularly if access to welfare was reserved for citizens,” he said.\n“It would show that anyone arriving in Australia does not automatically become an Australian or gain access to taxpayer-funded services.”\nAustralian Council of Social Services CEO Dr Cassandra Goldie said: “A proposal that only citizens could be entitled to income support would likely be in breach of the right to social security and grossly undermines our social safety net.\n“As a wealthy country, we have an obligation to ensure that all people, including children, are not in poverty. Australia has the most targeted system of income support in the world and there are already strict rules around eligibility for payments.\n“This proposal would take us back to 1909 when people had to show they were of ‘good character’ to get a pension and automatically exclude large numbers of people from social security and throw them into destitution.\n“Our political leaders should instead be discussing how to increase Newstart, which would be the single most effective measure to reducing poverty in this country.”\nDavid Leyonhjelm.
