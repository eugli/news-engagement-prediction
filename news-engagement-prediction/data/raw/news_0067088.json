We also hire from campuses like NITIE ,\" he said. \n\nAirtel is not alone. While full-time general MBA remains the most considered programme type among recruiters, there is increasing demand for specialised management graduates, and a host of management schools across the country now offer specialised courses in areas ranging from logistics and supply chain management, to oil and gas management. \n\nAccording to universities and business schools, specialised programmes make sense for those who already have some specific expertise and are looking to update their skillsets and competencies to grow in the chosen area. \n\n\"Very niche programmes like these — for instance, the one in consulting management — will help a student specialise in how to deal with clients, reports and various bench-marking skills very much from the start,\" said Nitish Jain, president at SP Jain School of Global Management. The institute offers specialised degrees in logistics and supply chain management and consulting management. \n\nUtpal Ghosh, president at University of Petroleum and Energy Studies, said, \"The MBA segment is getting overcrowded at several levels, and institutes and students are looking to find differentiators. A lot of students are looking for sector specialisations at an early stage.\" \n\nThe university offers specialised management courses in oil and gas, aviation, infrastructure management, ports and shipping, and power. \n\nChinese multinational Lenovo is among the companies looking to hire candidates with specialised MBA degrees. \"In the last year, our requirement for them has shot up in the areas of analytics business in India,\" said Rohit Sandal, HR director of the PC maker in India. \"We also have a marketing hub which does creative work for our Europe and US offices. These kinds of roles can be filled well by specialised MBA graduates,\" he said. \n\nLenovo is considering visiting specific campuses to recruit those with degrees in analytics, communications and marketing next year, Sandal said. \n\nAdarsh Khandelwal, director at admission consultancy and coaching firm Collegify, said a rising number of students in the past two years have approached the firm “with plans to pursue specialist MBA programmes”. \n\nWeSchool, or Welingkar Institute of Management, offers specialised MBA degrees in areas like rural management, retail management, sports management, and healthcare management. \"We are soon planning to roll out a specialised MBA course in sports management, and have been in extensive talks with some top institutes in Australia to discuss how this can be taken forward,\" said Uday Salunkhe, group director at WeSchool. \"Right now we are focusing on getting our ecosystem ready, we will probably roll it out as a short-term course and thereafter make it a specialised MBA degree.\" \n\nChennai-based Great Lakes Institute of Management, too, offers a specialised programme in business analytics. \n\nSome experts, however, feel that the rush for specialised MBA will lose steam in the years to come. Dishan Kamdar, deputy dean of academic programmes at The Indian school of Business, believes that in the long run students will only opt for generic MBA programmes.
