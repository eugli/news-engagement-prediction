He spoke about his experience meeting two American presidents and of course, about his favourite Bollywood actor. Suhani Singh | Posted by Devarsi Ghosh A + A - Sunny Pawar (L) and in a still from Lion (R) \nWhen the diminutive Sunny Pawar walks into the room, a smile invariably makes its way on your face. For all his cuteness and dynamic presence, it is not easy to get a reply from Sunny Pawar that is longer than two sentences. His favourite way to describe a lot of things is \" Bahut achcha \". With father Dilip Pawar also present in the room, we get to know a tad more about the eight-year-old actor who is earning acclaim for his performance in Lion. \nBased on the true, inspiring story of Saroo Brierley, an Australia-based Indian who found his biological parents using Google Earth, Lion is nominated for six Oscars including Best Picture. Sunny, who was only five at the time of shoot has made a strong first impression for playing the younger Saroo who gets separated from his family and ends up in an orphanage in Kolkata. He is ultimately adopted by an Australian couple living in Hobart, Australia. \nLion is unlike Slumdog Millionaire, says actor Priyanka Bose \n\"Sunny was a precocious five-year-old on set,\" says Ananya Rane, the first assistant director on the film. \"He is wiser way above his years. He has this bindass personality as well.\" \nThat aspect of his personality has definitely struck a chord with Hollywood which welcomed him with 'awws' at the 74th Golden Globe Awards ceremony when he came to introduce Lion alongside his co-star Dev Patel, who plays the adult Saroo. (Patel has been nominated in the Best Supporting Actor category at the Oscars) Wearing a black tuxedo accompanied with sneakers purchased from Santa Cruz, a suburb in Mumbai, Sunny was calm and confident, flashing that infectious smile. Was he nervous? Sunny promptly replies \"No.\" \nReturning after month-long promotions in United States during which he met two former US Presidents - Bill Clinton and Barack Obama - Sunny appears unfazed by the sudden fame he has acquired. Though Dilip Pawar did notice that his son was sad after he lost the best young performer at the Critics' Choice Awards. \n\"I told him that the biggest reward you can get is that people see your film and appreciate your work,\" said Pawar. \nFULL LIST OF OSCAR NOMINATIONS AT THE 89TH ACADEMY AWARDS \nThe earnestness of the child in him is very much intact. When asked which President did he like meeting more, he instantly said Obama. Dev bhaiya aka Dev Patel, whom he bonded with during the promotional leg, is \" bahut achche \" so is Nicole aunty aka Nicole Kidman, who plays Sue, the woman who adopts Saroo. \nIn the aftermath of Lion, life has changed a bit for the Pawars. \"There is just more travelling for now,\" said Dilip who is expected to leave with Sunny for the Oscar campaign. Dilip Pawar quit his job so as to be by his son's side. He was a housekeeper initially and at one point cleaned the streets. Having never ventured outside India, Pawar and his son's passport now have stamps of both United States and Australia. The latter is where Sunny shot a segment of the film. \nPawar wants to ensure that Sunny strikes a balance between studies and work. It helps that the teachers are supportive and encouraging. They know that he has found another love in acting. Thankfully for them his love for mathematics remains. \n\"I tell him to work hard so that he can do both,\" says Dilip Pawar. \"Then he won't have to struggle and worry about his future.\" \nSunny wants to act more which isn't a surprise for the father, who always spotted him in front of the television trying to mimic the actors on screen. Sunny has already shot Love Sonia, in which, he, in his own words, sells mangoes. Other than that he is totally at ease in front of the camera, he is just like any other kid. \nHe likes to watch Chhota Bheem. (Hey Bollywood, if you are looking to make a live-action version of the popular character, you know who to cast.) He can't say no to chocolates. His favourite is 5 Star. He likes remote-controlled toy cars. Singham is his favourite film and therefore Ajay Devgn his favourite actor. \nWhat about actress? None. Boys his age, we guess, are too cool for girls. So will he take his friends to see Lion? Sunny smiles and says \"Yes.\" \n(The writer tweets as @suhani84 .) \nWATCH: Who won what at the 88th Academy Awards To get the latest entertainment news and gossip, follow us on Twitter @Showbiz_IT and Like us on facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
