A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. \nBeans and legumes | One study found that for every 20g intake of legumes (beans, lentils), the risk of death fell by 6 percent. Beans are the only food that can fit into both a vegetable and a protein category. And the color of the bean matters, too. Just like vegetables, more color equals higher antioxidant levels. Take note: Black beans contain 40 times the amount of antioxidants found in white beans.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Blueberries | They’re crammed with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, natural compounds that decrease inflammation, guard cells against damage from free radicals and reduce the risk of certain cancers, heart disease, stroke and age-related brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Coffee | Coffee reduces the risk of age-related mental decline and may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. A Finnish study found that people who regularly drank coffee during their middle-age years were significantly less likely to suffer dementia and Alzheimer’s later in life. Those who drank three to five cups daily had a 65 percent reduction in risk.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Dark chocolate | Residents of the San Blas Islands of Panama have virtually zero high blood pressure or heart disease. Researchers think it’s because they eat a lot of chocolate. Dark chocolate contains polyphenols, which are believed to lower blood pressure and improve the flexibility of blood vessels.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Green tea | It’s a rich source of antioxidants and has been shown to keep you mentally alert, help with weight loss, regulate cholesterol levels and prevent sun damage. There is preliminary evidence that regularly drinking green tea may even help prevent or slow the growth of certain cancers. For maximum health benefits, choose loose-leaf green tea.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Hot peppers | Chinese researchers studied nearly 500,000 people. Those who ate fiery foods at least one day a week over four years cut their risk of dying by 10 percent; and those who ate it three to seven days a week saw a 15 percent drop. The researchers credit capsaicin, the compound that makes spicy foods hot. It has anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anticancer properties.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Nuts | They’re rich in heart-protective unsaturated fat and provide an excellent source of (non-meat) protein.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Oats | They’re are one of the best sources of soluble fiber, which helps reduce LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and control blood sugar, which cuts your risk of developing heart disease and diabetes.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Salmon | It’s one the best sources of omega-3 fatty acids, a noted “brain food” that may reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Omega-3 also decreases the risk of abnormal heartbeats, lowers triglyceride levels, slows the growth of artery-clogging fat deposits and reduces blood pressure.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Soy | It’s rich in flavonoids, compounds that protect the heart and guard against breast cancer. Fermented soy foods contribute to a healthy intestinal ecology.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Spinach | One cup of spinach contains as much bone-building calcium as one cup of milk, and it’s also a good source of magnesium, a mineral that helps your body’s muscular and cardiovascular systems function. Plus, spinach is loaded with vitamins A and E, antioxidants that support the health of your cells.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Sweet potatoes | They’re a good source of potassium, which can help lower your blood pressure. They’re also packed with vitamin A, important for vision, bone health, reproduction and cell growth and maintenance.  Getty Images/iStockphoto Fullscreen Yogurt | It’s loaded with probiotics, “friendly bacteria” similar to the bacteria naturally found in the gut. There is emerging evidence that regularly consuming yogurt and other sources of probiotics can help bolster general wellness, prevent certain cancers, boost the immune system, improve digestion, protect against disease and treat some health conditions including diarrhea, urinary tract infections and irritable bowel syndrome.
