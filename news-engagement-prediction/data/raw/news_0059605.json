We've heard from employers who need me to go tomorrow and bring people back,\" she said. \nThe report, called \"Now or Never: A Call to Action for Nova Scotians,\" addresses concerns about the province's economic health and population decline. \nCounty 'hitting a crisis mode' The aim of the initiative, funded in part by corporate sponsorship, the Lunenburg County Community Fund as well as the Community Foundation of Nova Scotia, is to sell the community to towns and cities across the country.\n\"We are hitting a crisis mode for not having enough people to fit the talent pool,\" said Hennigar.\nThe van leaves in July, starting in Montreal and will make its way across the country, finally ending up in Victoria, B.C., Hennigar said.\nDestinations between Quebec and B.C. are still being planned. But Hennigar estimates she'll be on the road for a total of 33 days.\nEmbracing collaboration Hennigar hopes to get some input on her trip from people all over the South Shore who are looking to see the population grow.\n\"We're kind of painting the rocket as it takes flight. So, it's changing all the time,\" she said.\n\"It's all about collaboration. I knew if I sat behind a desk expecting to greet hordes of people looking to relocate here, I'd be waiting a very long time.\"\nA chance to attract the unemployed Hennigar says they got a call from the town of St. Marys, Ont., requesting a stop in their town after a Kraft Heinz Co. plant closure put nearly 200 out of work.\n\"I'll promote our employment and development opportunities, our real estate — which is very affordable — as well all the great things we offer, [some] I'm still learning about,\" she said.\nNova Scotia's population has never been higher, thanks to immigration \nCape Breton University to come up with immigration strategy \nStudents show support Bridgewater high school student Juliette Lennox thinks it's important for young people to support the tour.\n\"Local businesses give back, on average, to the community 250 per cent more than larger corporations. We need young people, entrepreneurs to come into the area and start businesses.\"\nStudent Juliette Lennox plans to return to Nova Scotia after attending university in Montreal. (Jerri Southcott/CBC)\nBen Halverson is also a high school student in Bridgewater concerned about the number of young \npeople leaving the South Shore for school and not planning to return.\n\"If people return or come into the province and start businesses and create jobs within our community, it will help economically and it will make the province a better place to live.\"\n'I'd really like to come back' While Lennox will be attending McGill in the fall studying science and psychology, there's no question where she plans to start her career.\n\"I'm from Scotland. My family moved to Canada when I was three. I've always had a lot of cultural conflict, with my parents wanting to go back to Europe. But as I've grown up here, I've come to realize that this is my home,\" she said. \n\"I'm actually quite connected to my Nova Scotian roots now. I'd really like to come back.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T08:41:40.324+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
