The petite actress who has been ruling Kollywood for the past 14 years has confirmed this just by entering the Twitter from where she exited in January due to the controversies surrounding her perceived stand on Jallikattu. Trisha played the female lead in the 2003 blockbuster 'Saamy' directed by Hari with Vikram. That was her second release in Tamil and her first blockbuster which established her as a heroine in Tamil cinema. Cut to 2017, the former Miss Madras is in the 15th year of her film career and she is still acting as the female lead in multiple projects that include 'Sathuranga Vettai 2' with Arvind Swamy, '96' with Vijay Sethupathi, 'Garjanai' the Tamil remake of 'NH10' and an untitled Malayalm film with Nivin Paul among others. This will be Trisha's third film with Vikram and Hari. She has acted with Vikram in 'Bheema' directed by Lingusamy and in director Hari's 'Aaru' with Suriya. 'Saamy 2' will be directed by Hari with Vikram in the lead and the film will be produced by Shibu Thameens. Harris Jayraj who gave super hit tunes for 'Saamy' will be doing the same for 'Saamy 2'. The film is expected to go on floors by Summer 2017. As of now the makers are busy with the pre-production and finalisation of cast and crew members.
