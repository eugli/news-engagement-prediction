Investigators are checking whether the attack had any link to the cases she had handled in relation to environmental issues,\" Abella told the Agence France-Presse by telephone. \n\"They now have the identity of at least one of the perpetrators and a hot pursuit operation is ongoing,\" she said without naming the suspect. \nAbella said police were at the moment unaware if Mascarinas-Green had been threatened previously in relation to her work. \nHer children are twins, aged two, and a 10-year-old daughter, according to local media reports. \nHer death brings to 112 the number of environmental campaigners murdered in the Philippines over the past 15 years, according to Filipino environment monitor Kalikasan. \nThis includes 12 since   took office 7 months ago, Kalikasan said. \n\"Most of these cases remain unresolved as the government continues to ignore the threat against environmental defenders,\" Clemente Bautista, its national coordinator told AFP. \n\"What this means is that the perpetrators are emboldened to do it again and again because no one ever gets caught.\" \nGreenpeace Southeast Asia executive director Yeb Sano also said the killing highlighted the culture of impunity in the Philippines, where powerful figures abuse a corrupt political and justice system to literally get away with murder. \n\"Those who cause environmental destruction are resorting to savage measures and deplorable acts to stop communities and people who are standing up to protect our imperilled environment,\" Sano said. \nEnvironmental monitor Global Witness separately lists 88 killings of environmental activists and workers in the Philippines between 2010 and 2015. \nThe attacks spiked with 33 dead in 2015, ranking the Philippines as the second most dangerous country in the world for environmental campaigners behind Brazil.
