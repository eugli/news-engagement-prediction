Three weeks after Yanukovych was “run out” of the Ukraine, in 2014, Dmitry Firtash was arrested while in Austria. \nIn 2008, Firtash and Manafort were reported to have had plans together to invest $900 million into revamping New York City’s Drake Hotel that never came to fruition. It has been alleged that the entire deal was conceived as a way for Dmitry Firtash to “park his ill-gotten billions that he had siphoned out of Ukraine.” \nUntil today, requests on the part of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to extradite the businessman to the United States, where Firtash has been indicted, had been turned down by Austria courts, despite the fact that they were willing to arrest and detain him. \nThis is a breaking news story; updates to follow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T21:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T16:47:18.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
