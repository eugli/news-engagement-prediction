Shocking video footage shows Harrison Ford missed crashing his plane in California by a whisker \nAfter attempting to remove the clothing by turning the car on, she noticed two other cars hovering nearby – one with the engine running. \nThe 19-year-old said she immediately felt uneasy so decided not to get out of the car, and instead drive away. \nSpeaking to Metro.co.uk , she said: ‘My initial thought was that someone had just thrown it on my car for some reason. Ashley spoke out following the ordeal (Picture: Facebook/Ashley Hardacre) She was left terrified (Picture: Facebook/Ashley Hardacre) \n‘But when I tried to use my wipers to get it off I noticed it was wrapped around and I knew it was intentional, so I got scared.’ \nAfter driving half a mile, Ashley pulled over near a restaurant and leaned out of the window to free the shirt from the screen. Police sent seven dead victims of Croydon tram crash invites to survivors’ group \nShe added: ‘I was very scared. My family and friends are all scared and worried, but they are very proud that I am spreading awareness. \n‘I’m nervous while walking to my car now, but I do have security with me now to protect me.’ \nFollowing the incident, Ashley took to Facebook to reveal the incident. \nShe said: ‘There were two cars near me and one was running so I immediately felt uneasy and knew I couldn’t get out to get it off. \n‘I had seen posts lately about people finding things under their windshield wipers in the Flint area as an attempt to get girls out of their cars and distracted. Peggy, 96, has been volunteering at a homeless shelter for 80 years \n‘I don’t know why the shirt was on my car but it had to have been intentional the way it was put on there. \n‘I really can’t think of another reason as to why someone would put it on my car.’ \nSecurity at the establishment where Ashley works now guide her to her car each evening. \nLocal police have also been informed of the incident.
