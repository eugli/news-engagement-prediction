I am fascinated by how this artificial landscape offered a new way for people in the city to experience nature. in burkina faso, I am accustomed to being confronted with climate and natural landscape as a harsh reality. for this reason, I was interested in how my contribution to this royal park could not only enhance the visitor’s experience of nature, but also provoke a new way for people to connect with each other.’ \nnational park of mali; bamako, mali, 2010image © kéré architecture \n\n\nkéré is the 17th architect to conceive a temporary pavilion for serpentine galleries . the brief for the annual commission, which began in 2000, is to design a 300 square meter structure that can be used as a community hub and café by day, and a forum for learning, debate and entertainment at night. each pavilion is sited on the serpentine gallery’s lawn for four months. last year, bjarke ingels’ ‘unzipped wall’ was visited by more than 250,000 people. this year’s pavilion will host a program of events exploring questions of community and rights to the city, as well as the continuation of the serpentine’s public performance series. \ncamper pop-up shop at vitra; weil am rhein, germany, 2015 image © vitra \n\n\n‘ we are thrilled to reveal the designs for francis kéré’s pavilion, which highlight the power of simplicity by reducing architecture to its core elements, modeled in harmony with the natural context of royal kensington gardens ,’ commented serpentine galleries CEO, yana peel , and artistic director, hans ulrich obrist . ‘this pavilion will be a space of conversation, collaboration and exchange. we share kéré’s belief that architecture, at its best, can enhance our collective creativity and push people to take the future into their own hands.’ \nportrait of francis kéré ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T23:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T04:38:10.972+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
