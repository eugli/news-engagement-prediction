GPs and our teams conduct the vast majority of patient contacts in the NHS for a fraction of the budget Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners \nT wo of the “Sustainability and Transformation Plans” which are being brought in following a record NHS overspend last year, propose to reduce the number of GPs in the local area. \nHowever, many other plans are “vague at best”, according to the profession’s leaders, and could be a prelude to more widespread reductions. \nIn November the British Medical Association said that two out of three NHS doctors had not been consulted over plans which could also see bed cuts and closures of Accident & Emergency departments. \nIt comes as research shows the proposals, being drawn up across the NHS, will mean at least £22bn in cuts. \nProfessor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College, said: “The future of our health service relies on high quality, robust general practice, but it would appear that this may not be the case for vast swathes of the patient population across England.” \n“GPs and our teams conduct the vast majority of patient contacts in the NHS for a fraction of the budget. \n“We provide the most cost-effective form of care, keeping our patients safe, in the community, and out of hospitals where care is more expensive.\" Follow Telegraph News", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T06:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T01:44:02.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
