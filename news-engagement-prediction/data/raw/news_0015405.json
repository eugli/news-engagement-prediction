Ill-fitting suit? Check. Alternative facts? Check. Insane gum addition ? Check and check. SEE ALSO: Trumpâ€™s Muslim Ban could have doomed Apple \nParodying Spicer's infamously testy relationship with the press, Spicer/McCarthy used his bully pulpit Saturday to physically bully journalists. \nHe booed the New York Times, tried to explain why Steve Bannon is on the National Security Council using a giant key and visor as props, and deployed a super soaker filled with soapy water to harass journalists when they asked annoying questions. \nOh and that Muslim travel ban of Trump's? \"The travel ban is not a ban, which makes it not a ban.\" \nHonestly, if McCarthy took over an actual White House press briefing no one would notice.
