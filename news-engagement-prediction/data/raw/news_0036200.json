Our program will familiarize students with a wide range of approaches, methodologies, professional skills, and scholarly platforms applicable in social science, humanities, and creative research.” \n“The fact that UC Santa Cruz was one of only five universities nationwide selected to pilot a new SSRC Dissertation Proposal Development program is a sign of our innovative leadership in interdisciplinary scholarship and graduate research,” added Miller. “UCSC's program will give students across the divisions of social sciences, humanities, and the arts, the opportunity to engage fully with UC Santa Cruz's interdisciplinary environment and do pathbreaking doctoral research themselves.” \nIn addition to UC Santa Cruz, the University Initiative is also partnering with Cornell University, Northwestern University, the University of Massachusetts, and the University of Minnesota. It is funded by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. \n“The proposed programs put forth by these universities demonstrate uncommonly innovative interdisciplinary approaches to dissertation research proposal development, and graduate education more broadly,” said Ira Katznelson, president of the SSRC. \n““We believe these programs, once implemented by the universities, will inspire graduate students to create groundbreaking, compelling proposals that will effectively communicate the potential contributions their research can make within and beyond academe,” he added.
