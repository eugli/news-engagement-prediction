DRAW \nThe biggest talking point from the main event was that both AJ Styles and Luke Harper fell to the outside at the same time, with the referees failing to pick a winner and calling it a draw.

Article continues below \nMany originally believed that WWE were doing this to simply waste time in the build-up to the eventual clash between Wyatt and Orton, but that’s reportedly not the case. UNDECIDED \nThey’re claiming that the only reason it ended in a draw is because officials are genuinely unsure at this stage whether they want Harper in the title match or not. \nFans want him in there as they believe he’s criminally underrated and underutilised by the company, but his booking in the last month or so has been fantastic, and not having him in that match would definitely damage his momentum at a crucial time of the year. \nThere’s also discussion on whether they should have Wyatt turn face against Orton, which makes it more difficult for Harper to be included in that match. \nWWE are running out of time to make that decision, and it’s a huge one to make with not much time left, but all of the questions will hopefully be answered next Tuesday. \nShould Luke Harper be involved in the WWE Championship match at WrestleMania?
