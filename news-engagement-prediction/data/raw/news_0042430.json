Narayanan said yesterday it had collected donations worth RM152,744.80 from the devotees. \nThis comes after Penang Hindu Endowment Board chairman Dr P. Ramasamy said it would announce the total donations it received from the golden chariot procession and the Sri Balathandayuthpani Hilltop Murugan Temple in Jalan Kebun Bunga tomorrow. \nFor the first time this year, there were two chariot processions – the silver one by the Chettiars and golden chariot by the board. This year, said Dr Narayanan, the trustee had appointed an independent team to manage all the donations and jewelleries received during the procession. \n“Cash donations of the silver chariot were transferred and held in the custody of a private licensed security firm. We also appointed an audit firm to witness the counting of the donations,” he said. \nDr Narayanan said costs for the procession, the Thaipusam celebration at the temple in Jalan Kebun Bunga and the distribution of free food and facilities for devotees would come from the trust fund. \n“We have also given donations to several non-governmental bodies as in previous years,” he said, adding that these were made in the presence of Health Minister Datuk Seri Dr S. Subramaniam and Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng on Thaipusam. \nThe recipients are SJKT Sungai Bakap’s Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) (RM10,000), Vallalar Helping Hand Association (RM5,000), Penang Shan Children’s Home (RM5,000) and Dhyana Ashram (RM5,000).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T01:59:45.301+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
