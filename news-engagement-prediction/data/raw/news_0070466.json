Keep smiling! Mourinho of all people melts hearts with touching message to Ranieri \nThe left-back sustained a career-threatening double leg break last season but he’s been in full training with Mourinho’s squad over the last few months. \nUnited have a congested fixture list but the likes of Daley Blind, Ashley Young and Matteo Darmian have all been favoured in wide areas. Shaw’s made just 14 appearances this term (Picture: Getty) \nMourinho insisted last week that he wanted to keep Shaw this summer but, according to the Guardian , the defender could look to leave at the end of the season for first team football. \nThe England international is thought to be ‘bemused’ by the treatment he’s received from the United boss and can’t see why he hasn’t been used in recent FA Cup and Europa League fixtures. \nUnderstandably, Shaw is desperate for action after spending 12 months on the sidelines but he’s been reduced to just 14 appearances this term – only one of which has come in 2017.
