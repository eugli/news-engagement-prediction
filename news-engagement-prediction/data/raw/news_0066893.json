SUPPLIED \nA draft impression of Kenepuru Landing's first stage. \nCarrus is behind another major Porirua subdivision, Aotea, which is aimed at the more expensive end of the market. \nREAD MORE: \nKenepuru Landing would be more affordable, the general manager of Carrus' property division, Scott Adams said. \nUp to 800 dwellings could ultimately be built at Porirua's proposed Kenepuru Landing. \n\"There's a great opportunity, we think, to capture that first home buyer market, given that we've got the future Transmission Gully link right on the doorstep,\" he said. \nThe first stage is expected to contain about 150 dwellings, the majority of which would be priced in the mid-$500,000 range. \nBy contrast, the median house price for Tawa to Pukerua Bay in January was $460,000. SUPPLIED \nAn artist's impression of Ian Cassels' apartment vision for council land near Porirua station. He is also converting the nearby NZ Post building into apartments. \nAdams said pricing had been done with Kiwisaver Homestart grants in mind. \n\"One of the requirements is that the house has to be $550,000 or less, and there's nowhere really in the Wellington region that you can really find that sort of price now\". \nThe project was also hoping to attract empty nesters wanting to live close to public transport. MARK ROUND/FAIRFAX NZ \nAn aerial shot of Kenepuru Hospital and surrounding land in 2002. \nResidents would be a few minutes walk to two railway stations, Kenepuru and Porirua, and a pedestrian link would be built to the city centre and North City shopping mall. \n\"So it ticks all the boxes as far as medium-density living goes,\" Adams said. \n\"We're trying to promote sustainable, environmentally friendly living and trying to discourage the use of the vehicle, even though that will still be handy to the Wellington CBD.\" \nUltimately the project is expected to keep expanding until 2025. \nEarthworks are set to begin in March and civil works in the second half of the year, while resource consent is sought for the designs. \nConstruction is expected to begin next February. \nAdams declined to put a figure on how much the project would cost as the costs were often changing. \nAnd although Wellington's housing market was currently booming, he said the project's timing was also not a given. \nDevelopments could take 12 to 18 months from consents to physically works and \"a lot can happen to the property market in that time\". \nAuckland's housing boom was \"certainly\" going to end, and \"they say when Auckland sneezes, the rest of the country catches a cold\". \nHowever, the Wellington market was \"quite buoyant\". \n\"I don't think it's necessarily overpriced and I think the market we're going for, because of net migration and all those factors, there's still going to be demand for housing\". \nOther rejuvenation plans for Porirua include a plan by Ian Cassels' firm The Wellington Company to convert the old NZ Post building into apartments. \nAnother potential housing development on Plimmerton Farm north of Porirua has been under negotiation for some years. \nThe future ownership structure of North City is also in flux, which might ultimately refresh the slightly dated mall. \nNgati Toa's executive director Matiu Rei said several old Porirua hospital buildings would be demolished to make way for the development. The current Kenepuru Hospital was outside it. \nHe said the iwi was pleased to be involved. \n\"Affordable housing is an issue ... and we're very pleased to be part of a venture which hopefully will be of great assistance to younger families to get into their own property.\" \nSome of the land was zoned industrial and would be set aside for limited light commercial use, largely along Kenepuru Drive. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:02:25.553+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
