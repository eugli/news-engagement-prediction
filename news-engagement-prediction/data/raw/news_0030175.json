Looks worse w the dressing on then off! WEARSUNSCREEN.” \nThe actor was first treated for basal-cell carinoma in November 2013. He posted a photo online, saying his wife, Deborra-Lee Furness, had encouraged him to get the “mark” checked. \nThis marks his fifth procedure on his nose. A photo posted by Hugh Jackman (@thehughjackman) on Feb 8, 2016 at 7:57am PST \n\nJackman opened up to PEOPLE about his battle with skin cancer in 2015, during which he admitted he was shocked to learn of his diagnosis. \n“It’s always a bit of a shock just hearing the word ‘cancer,’” he said. “Being an Australian it’s a very common thing. I never wore sunscreen growing up so I was a prime candidate for it.” \nBasal-cell carcinoma is the single most common form of cancer, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. Almost 3 million cases are diagnosed in the U.S. each year. It almost never spreads beyond the lesion site but can be disfiguring if allowed to grow. A photo posted by Hugh Jackman (@thehughjackman) on May 8, 2014 at 4:28pm PDT \n\nAlong with the spot on his nose, he has also had skin cancer cells removed from his shoulder. \n“I go every three months for check-ups,” he said. “It’s the new normal for me. My doctor says I’ll likely have more, and if that’s your cross to bear in life, you should be so lucky.” Show Full Article More People Logo", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:42:16.086+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
