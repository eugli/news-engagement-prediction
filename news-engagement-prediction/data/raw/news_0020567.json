She had been an accomplice in her daughter's drugging and kidnapping. Shannon's shocking 'disappearance' after failing to return home from a school swimming trip bore a chilling similarity to that of three-year-old Maddie. She was snatched from her bed in a holiday apartment in Portugal in May 2007 – and her plight was highlighted at least three times in the first episode of The Moorside. Karen Matthews holds her daughter's favourite teddy bear as she makes an emotional appeal for her safe return in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, March 2008 Mrs McCann holds her daughter's Cuddle Cat soft toy outside a church in Portugal in 2007 In one scene Matthews's friend and search co-ordinator Julie Bushby, played by Sheridan Smith, discusses a candelit vigil after the mother's TV appeal. A friend, viewing the papers the next day, says: 'It must be working all this, they are offering a reward of £20,000.' Bushby's young son chips in: 'They are offering £2.5million for Maddie McCann. Is that because they're posher than us?' His mother replies: 'It's not a contest.' In another clip while discussing how best to launch the media plea with a detective, Matthews says: 'I've got my cuddly bear that you wanted, like Maddie's mum wants her Cuddle Cat.' The police officer asks: 'Is that Shannon's favourite' and her mother takes a long pause before answering 'Probably!' Matthews's appearance before cameras clutching the toy was a near carbon copy to Mrs McCann's genuine pleas to her daughter's abductor. Search co-ordinator Julie Bushby is played by Sheridan Smith in the new BBC mini series Smith stands with the character of DC Alex Grummit, played by Steve Oram, in The Moorland Shannon’s shocking ‘disappearance’ after failing to return home from a school swimming trip - as featured in The Moorland (above) - bore a chilling similarity to that of three-year-old Maddie Maddie's favourite soft toy Cuddle Cat had been left lying on her bed when she vanished. In the early days Mrs McCann kept the grubby pink animal which she later recalled was dirty and 'smelt of suntan lotion' close to her. The grief stricken mother was photographed carrying the toy everywhere. During the show's appeal, Matthews shed crocodile tears as she echoed some of Mrs McCann's words, begging: 'I need her home. If anyone's got my beautiful princess, bring her home.' A source close to the McCanns said: 'The whole Shannon Matthews saga only came about because of Madeleine's disappearance and what the family wrongly thought they could claw through rewards and interviews. 'The BBC have been trailing it for a few weeks. Kate and Gerry think the whole thing is appalling, and in really poor taste and bad timing. The mini-series follows the story of Karen Matthews (left) and her daughter Shannon (right) who ‘vanished’ from the Moorside council estate in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, in 2008 Plot: Shannon was eventually discovered drugged inside the wooden base of a double bed at the home of Michael Donovan (left), the uncle of stepfather Craig Meehan (right) 'They may not sit down and watch every minute of these programmes but they are aware of them and references to their family. 'They feel is very insensitive and the show tries to glorify a terrible crime involving a young girl.' Neither Shannon, now aged 18, nor her family say they were asked to co-operate in the prime time programme and even tried to ban it being aired. The drama, which continues next week, describes the frantic £3.2million police search for the schoolgirl. Hundreds of neighbours joined in the 24-day hunt unaware that her mother, inspired by the outpouring of grief and huge public donations to help find Maddie, was an elaborate hoax. Shannon was eventually discovered just a mile away, drugged inside the wooden base of a double bed at the home of Michael Donovan, the uncle of stepfather Craig Meehan, Matthews's boyfriend at the time. Matthews arrives at Wakefield Police Station in handcuffs after being arrested in 2008 West Yorkshire Police search for Shannon in 2008 following her apparent disappearance They had orchestrated the plot to bag the £50,000 reward money. As well as re-telling the search, the two-part series deals with the fallout of the community after they discovered they had been lied to. The Moorside writer Neil McKay defended not making contact with Shannon's family, insisting he didn't want to put Matthews back in the public eye. He said: 'We don't defend her or condemn her, and we don't make an apology for her crime.' Maddie's mother, a former GP, and heart doctor father, believe their daughter – who would now be 13, could still be alive. The couple, both 48, are hoping 'a miracle' reunites them with their daughter soon. Scotland Yard are working on one last 'throw of the dice' lead which the McCanns are praying could solve the mystery. Episode one of The Moorside was shown last night and is now available on BBC iPlayer . The second and final episode will air next Tuesday at 9pm.
