PAY AND PAY!   \nDear A.S.S. Editor Advertisement \nLTA has just announced two more ERP gantries to be activated starting next Monday onwards. This comes after their quarterly review on road conditions in Singapore. The two gantries are located after Adam Road and at the Mount Pleasant slip road into PIE (Changi). \nThe rate for both gantries will be $2 between 5.30pm and 7pm, and $1 from 7pm to 7.30pm. Meanwhile, ERP rates at two gantries along the north-bound Central Expressway (CTE) will also be increased during evening peak hours from Feb 20. Both gantries are located after the PIE exit. Of course, reason given by the LTA is that the expressway at the those directions has slowed down tremendously, so need to put up ERP to discourage drivers from using the expressway at the peak period timing. \nBut maybe, LTA see many cars passing through there, why not just activate gantry to get more motorist to pay? If they don't want to, they can always avoid. If they don't avoid, then they have to pay. Win win situation for the LTA. \nSamad F \nA.S.S.
