With him getting selected for the para shooting World Cup to be held in Dubai, there are more reasons for the 10m air rifle shooter to spend days at the range.\nSwaroop, 29, will be representing India at the World Shooting Para Sport in Al Ain from February 19 and will participate in 10m air rifle standing and prone events.\nSwaraoop trains at Gun For Glory academy in Balewadi and his selection in the Indian team for the World Cup comes after his gold-winning performance at the Nationals in December.\n\"I am glad that I have been officially selected for the Indian team. I was expecting it since my scores in the nationals were good. I thank Paralympic Committee of India for having their faith in me,\" said the wheelchair-bound shooter, who had earlier participated in the in Fort Benning, USA, World Cup in 2014 on his own expense.\n\"I took some loans to go there (USA). But I wasn't good enough with my scores. After coming back, I worked harder and got support from GFG. My scores have drastically improved in the last two years and this time I am hopeful of getting a medal,\" said Swaroop.\nThe lower-half of Swaroop's body was non-functional since berth. After appearing for his standard 12 exam, he quit studies and focused on sports. He took up shooting in 2012 after trying his hands at many other sports including table tennis and athletics. \"Then I realized that my strength lies in shooting. It is an expensive sport and considering my family's financial conditions, it was difficult for me to take up the sport. But I have been fortunate to get support from people around me,\" said Swaroop, who has a younger brother and his mother in Kolhapur.\nIt won't be a cakewalk for the national champion, but he is hopeful of putting a good fight.\n\"I have been shooting scores above 600, which is good at the world level. It will be a tough competition, but I am confident of shooting well,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:31:38.589+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
