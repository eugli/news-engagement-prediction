By David Rothkopf David Rothkopf is CEO and editor of the FP Group. His latest book, National Insecurity: American Leadership in an Age of Fear , was released in paperback earlier this year. February 13, 2017 - 10:03 pm \nOn this week’s episode of The E.R. , David Rothkopf, Ben Pauker, Rosa Brooks, and Kori Schake discuss the importance of checks and balances, both formal and informal, within the current U.S. government. With a new leak springing up almost daily from inside the White House, are checks and balances still effective? Or has the apparent “war on truth” fatally undermined public discourse? \nThe group reacts to Rosa’s FP column , and the Breitbart article that followed, which paid little heed to facts. And this trend, with the Trump administration’s encouragement, is responsible for the widening divide between truth and lies, The E.R. team argues. \nRosa Brooks is a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and teaches international law, national security, and constitutional law at Georgetown University.
