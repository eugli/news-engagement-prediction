It took about three minutes for that to happen. During an opening bit where Kimmel suggested that people of differing political ideologies should try to reach out to each other, Kimmel decided to try and reach out to somebody he's been having issues with. The Martian star Matt Damon. \"When I first met Matt, I was the fat one.\" I'll never tire of this feud. #oscars pic.twitter.com/B2szHLoaKO — CinemaBlend (@CinemaBlend) February 27, 2017 \nOf course, since this was a comedy bit, Jimmy Kimmel maybe wasn't as nice as he actually could have been. He said he'd known Matt Damon so long that when they first met, Kimmel had been \"the fat one.\" We're not entirely sure that Damon has gained all that much weight since he came on the Hollywood scene following Good Will Hunting unless the role called for it of course, but Damon seemed to tacitly agree that this was the case. \nFrom there, however, Jimmy Kimmel did pay some compliments to the accomplished actor. He brought up the fact that originally Matt Damon had planned to star in Manchester by the Sea . However, due to Damon's existing schedule, he realized he could not give the film the attention he thought it deserved. Instead, Damon stayed on as a producer and asked his old friend Casey Affleck to take the lead. Affleck has now been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor, which shows just how big a gift Damon handed over. As it stands, there's a pretty good chance that Affleck could walk away with the award tonight. \nSo what did Matt Damon do instead of star in Manchester by the Sea ? He starred in The Great Wall , which just came out, and isn't doing all the great at the box office. Jimmy Kimmel, however, had a different nickname for the film. — CinemaBlend (@CinemaBlend) February 27, 2017 \nIt will be interesting to see if Jimmy Kimmel goes back to Matt Damon well again before the night is over. The pair have been part of an ongoing series of jokes as part of Kimmel's late night talk show. Of course, if you don't actually watch the show, you might not have any idea what's going on. We'll call this an inside joke for fans of Jimmy Kimmel Live and we'll look forward to see who else will get some decent punchlines before the night is out.
