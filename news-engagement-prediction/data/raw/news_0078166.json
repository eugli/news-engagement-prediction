Distressing footage emerges of mother kicking her baby because she won’t stop crying \nThe law changes were initially expected to be implemented on March 1. \nHowever they have arrived two days earlier, meaning those who don’t know the new rules better get learning – and fast. \nHere’s what you need to know about the new car seat laws. Parents who do not follow the rules will be fined (Picture: Getty Images) Who needs a car seat? \nAnyone who is under the age of 12-years-old, or above 135cm (4ft 4”) in height. Whatever comes first. \nWhen a child is over 12-years-old they no longer have to use a booster seat – however by law the child must wear a seatbelt. \nBabies who weigh under 9kg (1st 5lbs) are required to travel in a baby carrier, not a child seat. \nAnd if the child is under 15 months old, they must sit in a rear-facing seat. \nThe passenger airbag must be switched off if a child is sat in a booster seat in the front of the car. The Department of Transport A spokesman said: ‘The new rules mean that manufacturers aren’t allowed to introduce new models of backless booster seats for children shorter than 125cm (4ft 1”) or weighing less than 22kg (3st 4lbs).\n‘The change doesn’t affect existing models of seats or cushions and doesn’t mean that they are unsafe or illegal – though parents are still being encouraged to make sure they know the rules for using child car seats. \n‘The change to the technical standards means that the range of products available on the market are better suited for younger children.’ What happens if they don’t have one? \nYou will be fined. \nHow much? Well, according to the new law, those without a car seat could be facing a fine of up to £500. Top cop says paedophiles looking at child abuse images sholdn’t be charged \nYou could even be fined if you have a booster seat. \nHow? If the seat does not fit the correct requirements for the child’s age, height and weight, that’s how. Will I be fined with my existing seat? \nNo. Although backless booster seats are classed as being less safe than a high-backed chair, you will not be fined. \nThis is because the new laws only apply to the labelling on new seats that are currently on sale. \nSo when buying a new seat, make sure you check for an orange ‘approved’ label. \nThe label should have a capital E on it as well as the code R129. Children must use a booster seat up to the age of 12 (Picture: Getty Images) Are there any exceptions? \nYes, there are a few. \nParents travelling in an emergency are legally allowed to travel without putting their child in a car seat – but this is only when travelling a short distance and the child is more than three-years-old. \nChildren are also allowed tot ravel without a booster seat if they are in a minibus, minicab, coach or a van. \nThis does not count, however, if the child is sat in the front. \nThe last exception is for parents who have three children sitting in the back of the car. \nIf the third seat simply wont fit and the child is three-years-old or above, they may travel without a booster.
