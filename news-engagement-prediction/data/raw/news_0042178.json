Along with Kennedys Bush Rd, the road was opened for two hours from 10am, for residents only. \nWhile everyone praised the firefighting efforts that had saved many of their homes, they had only criticism for the complete lack of communication and misinformation. DAVID WALKER/FAIRFAX NZ \nThere is no access yet through the Worsleys Rd cordon, where the fire is still at risk of spreading. \n\"F idiots,\" one resident said with a disgusted head-shake, at the news the initial resident registration had closed at 2am. \"Some of us like to sleep,\" another called out. There was further confusion at the briefing, with one official saying they had to be out by 11am, and another saying 12pm. \nREAD MORE: * Gerry Brownlee 'perplexed' by response to Christchurch fires \nMany had not been allowed home since evacuating on Tuesday or Wednesday. Stubble had reached full beard, with the razors still in the bathroom. Some were still in the same stinky clothes. Some had \"blackmailed\" their way through, pleading the need to feed elderly cats. JACK FLETCHER/FAIRFAX NZ \nSeveral cordons along Cashmere Rd, including this one into Westmorland, have been lifted over the weekend. \nWhile Civil Defence has said four houses were destroyed, no-one seemed to know exactly which properties they were. \n\"The hardest thing for me has been the not knowing,\" one resident said. \nDespite only 11 houses being destroyed across the fire area, several locals said they had been reduced to trawling through photos on Stuff to try to work out whether their home was damaged. \n\"That's not a big number,\" said resident Chris Millar. \"Surely that is manageable in terms of communication – then people can rest easy. Nobody has really stepped up and owned the responsibility for making sure that happens.\" Ad Feedback \nMillar said he spent all week trying to get information, with no luck. He thought his house was standing, but was still not getting the regular updates promised at Saturday's residents' meeting. \nPeter Pritchard said the street residents had to put up their own road-block on Wednesday morning, before they were evacuated, to stem the endless stream of rubberneckers. \n\"That was pretty disappointing.\" \nFour days on, he still had not been allowed back in and had no idea of the state of his home. \n\"The communication has been pretty average. That's where a lot of the frustration has come from.\" \nCory Beynon was having a last-minute cigarette before heading up the hill with his 11-year-old son, Levi. He figured smoking would not be allowed in the fire area. \nHe had been home once, having pleaded the need to feed his 28 chickens and his cats Popeye and Olive, who were too old to move. He only had six minutes to evacuate, once he'd saved his classic cars out of storage at the bottom of the valley – a rare Skoda Felicia and a '73 customised Morris ute. \nBeynon's house was intact but severely smoke and water-damaged. He was also critical of the disaster's management. \n\"It was managed incorrectly right from the word go. Civil Defence and the rural fire department and defence should have been called in earlier. The fire would have been a lot smaller. But they saved my house – which is good.\" \nHe, his partner and Levi had been staying with friends – seven of them in a small house. He planned to use the two-hour window to clean out the fridge and freezer and had brought six loaves of bread to feed \"his boys and girls\" – the chooks. \nResidents worried that Sunday's limited access meant they would not be allowed back permanently for some time. \nTEMPORARY CORDON ACCESS \nAbout 120 homeowners are at their properties in Kennedys Bush after being granted access through a cordon in the area on Sunday morning. \nCivil Defence were letting people through the fire cordon, following \"significant progress\" containing the fire. \nAdult residents will be allowed temporary access to retrieve essential items this morning through two cordon points: 305 Kennedys Bush Rd and 51 Hoon Hay Valley Rd. \nCompulsory briefings for re-entry took place at 8am entry at Kennedys Bush Rd, and 9am at Hoon Hay Valley Rd. \nAccess has been extended until noon as many had difficulty attending the early briefings. About 30 people waited at the checkpoints this morning and they were now being allowed through the cordon. \nResidents wanting entry need to register, either at the cordon, online , or through Christchurch City Council's call centre . Everyone within the cordon will be given a 15-minute warning before access ends. \nWorsleys Rd, which was \"the most at risk of fire spreading\", remained closed and would be assessed later on Sunday, Civil Defence said. \nWeather conditions and the risk of the fire to spread would determine continued access. \nTwenty fire crews had made \"good progress\" overnight, with an estimated 68 per cent of the fire now controlled within a 29-kilometre perimeter. About 150 firefighters are working to extinguish the blaze. \nThree aircraft dropped about 60,000 litres of fire retardant between Kennedys Bush Rd and Hoon Hay Valley Rd on Saturday, and another drop in the Marley's Hill area was likely on Sunday. \nFire behaviour specialist Nathan Keoghan said the risk of fire remains high. A total fire ban for Christchurch is still in place. \n\"The 3 [millimetres] of rain over the last 24 hours has been helpful; however, more is needed . . . about 50mm in one day, or 30mm over three consecutive days, is needed to cool the extreme ground temperatures and lessen the risk of unburnt fuel catching fire.\" \nEleven houses were destroyed and hundreds of residents evacuated last week when the massive fire scorched the hills above Christchurch. Starting south of Christchurch in Marley's Hill, the fires grew to cover more than 2000 hectares. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T05:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T00:36:15.863+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
