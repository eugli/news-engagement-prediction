Carmelo Anthony (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 7:34  34 p.m. ET \nAs trade rumors swirl around Carmelo Anthony within the circus known as the Knicks, it's becoming more likely the struggling franchise won't be able to trade Anthony and his massive contract. \nIt won't be for a lack of trying. \nMORE: Kings GM Vlade Divac claims he had better offer for DeMarcus Cousins \nAccording to The Undefeated , the Knicks believe Anthony won't waive an expensive 15 percent trade kicker, which only adds to the remaining $54.1 million he's owed the next two seasons. \n“I haven’t figured out a situation that makes sense for both parties,\" Anthony told The Undefeated after Sunday's All-Star Game. \"I am not the kind of guy who just goes out there and says, ‘Get me outta here … get me outta here,’ without having a plan. It’s bigger than that.\" \nAnthony, who has been linked to the Cavaliers, Clippers and Celtics, has had to deal with criticism from fans and Knicks president Phil Jackson, which could lead most players to take the hint and waive the no-trade clause and play for a contender. \nThe Knicks have lost 21 of their last 28 games, but the All-Star break could be exactly what Anthony needed to clear his head. \n\"For me, it's good to see the support from my peers despite everything I have been having to deal with,\" Anthony told reporters Sunday. \"When you have your peers who understand it, they're the ones who are actually going through similar situations and can relate to those types of situations because they're in it. So to have my peers speak up and talk about that, it means a lot to me.\" \nAnthony regrouped with fellow trade rumor subject Jimmy Butler, who would be welcoming of Anthony in Chicago , but has also found some much-needed time off. \n“Mentally, I’m good. For me, I’m trying to compartmentalize [the rumors] and deal with it to be able to focus and have a clear mind,\" Anthony told The Undefeated. \"I’m just trying to play basketball and have fun. Sometimes I feel like I am not allowing it to be fun with everything going on. The last two months has been about me trying to enjoy the game.\" \nIt hasn't helped that the Knicks have the fourth-worst record in the East, but winning does help heal the wounds and New York is just four games out of the No. 8 seed after all.
