Doctors create term for pain Syrian children experience because it’s far worse than PTSD \nThe jubilant group were reportedly chanting about headteacher Michelle Brindle, who is at the centre of several complaints over her leadership. \nThe ongoing row involving school leaders, staff and parents, culminated with the school being closed with immediate effect at lunchtime yesterday. \nParents were contacted to collect their children and say they haven’t been told when the school will open again.
