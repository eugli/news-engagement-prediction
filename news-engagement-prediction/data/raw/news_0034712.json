What once seemed like a long shot bet now appears to be a wager hardly worth making, due to a low potential payout. \nThe odds also cover the possibility that Trump will be removed from office through the impeachment process. But with Republicans in control of both the United States House of Representatives and the Senate even starting an impeachment proceeding, much less obtaining the Senate votes necessary to convict and remove president from office, seems extremely unlikely. \nTo send articles of impeachment to the Senate for trial, a simple majority of House members must vote to do so. That means, 218 votes must go in favor of impeachment. But Republicans currently hold 239 House seats to only 193 for Democrats. In other words, even if every Democrat voted to impeach, at least 25 Republicans would need to join them in order for the Senate even to initiate an impeachment trial. \nWhile Republicans hold just 52 of the 100 Senate seats, giving them a far narrower majority, to convict and remove a president through impeachment requires at least 67 votes, a two-thirds “supermajority.” That means at least 15 Republicans would need to vote in favor of removing Trump from office even of every Democrat plus the two independent senators voted to convict.

In fact, should Trump simply die before his four years are up, all bets with legitimate bookmakers would be canceled. \nThe last, first and to date, only U.S. president to resign was Richard M. Nixon, the 37th of the now 45 presidents to serve. Nixon stepped down on August 9, 1974 , to avoid impeachment over his role in the Watergate scandal which involved the bugging of the Democratic National Committee offices and a subsequent cover-up by Nixon and his White House staff. \nTwo presidents have faced impeachment: 17th President Andrew Johnson in 1868, and 130 years later, 47th President Bill Clinton in 1998. But neither was convicted and forced to leave the presidency before their respective terms were up. The last president to be impeached was Bill Clinton, pictured above with wife Hillary Clinton, in 1998. But Clinton was not convicted by the Senate and remained in office.

But the betting house has since reduced those odds to almost even money — odds of 11-10 — that Trump will resign of be impeached and convicted before his term is up. \nThe Irish betting firm Paddy Power sees slightly better chances for Trump, and somewhat more tempting odds for bettors, seeing Trump at 15-8 to resign and 4-1 to be successfully impeached. That is, bettors who put down $15 on Trump to resign will win eight bucks if, in fact, Trump quits. \nMORE DONALD TRUMP COVERAGE FROM THE INQUISITR:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T07:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T02:44:23.114+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
