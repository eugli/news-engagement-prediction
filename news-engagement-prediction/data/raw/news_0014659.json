Tucker Company) \nThe Despa House is a quiet, gable-fronted brick cottage that sits on a cobblestoned stretch of Lockerbie Street. Modest Italianate details echo the home’s famous neighbor, the James Whitcomb Riley mansion , now a museum honoring the beloved Hoosier poet. \nThe Despa House, 538 Lockerbie St., predates the Riley home by almost a decade. Its original occupant, German immigrant Johan Ernst Despa, bought the lot in 1862 for $400 and built his home there in 1863. \nIn Despa’s time, Lockerbie Square was one of Indianapolis’ first suburban neighborhoods — perched just outside the city’s original mile square plat that was drawn in 1821. A house painter by trade, Despa and his family were among a wave of German immigrants who settled in Lockerbie Square, inspiring the area’s 19th century nickname: Germantown. \nNow, the home has been restored to its former glory and updated with modern comforts. It is on the market for $1,089,500 . Listing agent Matthew Kressley of F.C. Tucker Company said buyers only get a chance at a house of this vintage once a year, at most. \nThe home was restored by David and Nicole Marquart, a husband-wife team who have renovated and resold several houses in the Indianapolis area. The Despa House, Nicole Marquart said, is by far the oldest they have worked on. \nThe home was built by German immigrant Johan Ernst Despa, who was among a wave of German immigrants who settled in Lockerbie Square, inspiring the area’s 19th-century nickname, Germantown. (Photo: Provided by Bill Kruger) \nMarquart said their goal was to add modern luxuries while staying true to the history and character that drew them to it. \nThey bought the home last summer from Angela Stroud, who had lived there for nearly 35 years with her late husband, lawyer Ken Stroud . Ken had bought the house in 1972 with his first wife, Diana Stroud, who died six years later. Ken died in August 2015. \nBoth Marquart and Angela Stroud said they sensed something special about the home the first time they walked through its doors. It spoke to them, they said. \n“It is truly a remarkable house,” Stroud said. “It’s breathing. It’s not just brick and mortar. It has a spirit to it.” \nWhen Ken and Diana Stroud moved in, Lockerbie Square was at the beginning of its rebirth as a historic urban neighborhood. Ken helped write the bylaws of the newly formed Indianapolis Historic Preservation Commission , along with his neighbor and colleague, Indiana Supreme Court Justice Roger DeBruler. \nDiana, Angela said, had tremendous influence in revitalizing the human side of the Lockerbie neighborhood. She wove a community together from residents who had lived there for generations and the young “snooty” people who were moving in and bringing change. \nTwo snug bedrooms upstairs have sloped ceilings. (Photo: Provided by F.C. Tucker Company) \n“They didn’t think of themselves as pioneers,” Stroud said of Ken and Diana. “Everything came together at the same time.” \nThe home is just over 3,800 square feet on two levels, flanked by two brick-paved courtyards and two attached garages — a luxury Kressley said is hard to find in this area. \nThe foyer gleams with black-and-white tiled marble and opening onto a formal living room. The original hardwood staircase curves upstairs to two snug bedrooms with sloped ceilings that share a full bathroom (tiled in that same checkered marble). \nMarquart found period-appropriate light fixtures for the entry, formal living room and dining room, with help from Little Doc's Architectural Salvage & Antiques. Against all odds, she said, the three chandeliers she picked out and restored were near-perfect matches once all the paint and grime were stripped away. \nDoors and doorknobs are easier, she said. She’s particularly proud of the big antique French doors leading from the family room to the great room at the back of the house. \nThe kitchen is the only part of the original construction where modern luxuries reign. Custom Amish-built cabinetry reaches to the ceiling, topped with crown molding. The home’s original brick walls are exposed in lieu of backsplashes. \nDavid and Nicole Marquart added a large master closet to the home. (Photo: Provided by F.C. Tucker Company) \nMarquart chose period-appropriate black soapstone for the kitchen counters, which contrast with the white cabinetry. The large built-in island reversed the colors, with Super White granite topping black cabinets. \nMarquart said anything to do with water or lights was a challenge because there wasn't running water or electricity when the house was built. She had to compromise by choosing modern fixtures that feel like a throwback, such as the kitchen’s deep farmhouse sink, the two bathrooms’ clawfoot tubs and the powder room’s elevated toilet tank. \nThe door to the master bedroom has a plaque playfully proclaiming it as the “Royal Suite.” The Marquarts added a large walk-in closet, and balanced luxurious updates to the bathroom with vintage touches such as hexagonal marble tiles and exposed brick in the shower. \nThere is a newer wing at the back of the original home that the Strouds built in the early 2000s, adding ample space for entertaining. With soaring ceilings and skylights, the family room leads through to a great room equipped with a wet bar and a private patio backing up to the Riley Museum. \nKen Stroud used a wheelchair in the latter part of his life, so the house is set up for single-level living. The master suite, laundry, garage and entertaining spaces all are on the main level. The hallway that leads from the original house to the addition is a gently sloped ramp, which Angela said was popular among neighborhood kids for wheelchair races. \nThey often had children from the neighborhood over, Angela said, recalling the annual Christmas parties where kids always ran the show. Not to mention the 10-year stretch when the Strouds had the neighborhood’s first indoor pool, in the space where the great room now stands. \nEvidently, some of those kids still have fond memories of the house. Marquart recalled an evening when she was working on the fireplace in the front living room and turned around to see a family peering through the windows. The father turned out to be a nephew of Diana Stroud — all grown up and stopping by with his own family to see what had become of his old stomping grounds. \nAngela said some people expect her to be upset by the renovations the Marquarts made to her home of 35 years, but she feels the opposite. \n“It’s so thrilling to watch what you’ve done with it,” she said to Nicole, “It’s been a ball.” \nAbout the Home \n• Location: 538 Lockerbie Street. \n• Asking price: $1,089,500. \n• Details: 3,863 square feet on two levels; three bedrooms, two full bathrooms, two half bathrooms; two attached garages with space for three cars; great room with wet bar. \n• BLC: 21458319. \n• Contact: Matthew Kressley, F.C.
