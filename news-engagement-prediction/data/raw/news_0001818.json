It’s deadly and has a great sporting tradition.”\nTeam owner Rankin Smith said at the time: “I think the Atlanta Falcons is a good name, and we’ll do our best to make it a famous one.”\nThe Falcons, who began playing in 1966 in the old Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium as an NFL expansion team, are in the Super Bowl for only the second time this year, on Sunday vs. the New England Patriots.\nAnd FYI, Lancers and Thrashers finished tied for second.\nThe Atlanta Falcons have their own team of famous celebrity fans. From Samuel L. Jackson to former President Jimmy Carter to Usher, these fans have helped pack the Georgia Dome during Falcons games.", "external_links": ["https://players.brightcove.net/1345087319/default_default/index.min.js?videoId=5302812656001", "https://players.brightcove.net/"], "published": "2017-01-31T19:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-01T00:27:11.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
