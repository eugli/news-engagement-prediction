However, it said the company would take the information on board as it was able to upgrade the app used with the doll.\nBut experts have warned that the problem has not been fixed.\nThe Cayla doll can respond to a user's question by accessing the internet. For example, if a child asks the doll \"what is a little horse called?\" the doll can reply \"it's called a foal\".\nRory Cellan-Jones sees how Cayla, a talking child's doll, can be hacked to say any number of offensive things. A vulnerability in Cayla's software was first revealed in January 2015.\nComplaints have been filed by US and EU consumer groups .\nIn addition to the data protection concerns, a hack allowing strangers to speak directly to children via the My Friend Cayla doll has been shown to be possible.\nUnder German law, it is illegal to sell or possess a banned surveillance device. A breach of that law can result in a jail term of up to two years, according to German media reports.\nThe warning by Germany's Federal Network Agency came after student Stefan Hessel, from the University of Saarland, raised legal concerns about My Friend Cayla.\nMr Hessel, Quote: d by the German website Netzpolitik.org , said a bluetooth-enabled device could connect to Cayla's speaker and microphone system within a radius of 10m (33ft). He said an eavesdropper could even spy on someone playing with the doll \"through several walls\".", "external_links": ["http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-38222472", "https://netzpolitik.org/2017/schnueffelpuppe-my-friend-cayla-in-deutschland-verboten/", "http://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/F55F/production/_92851826_gettyimages-451250922.jpg"], "published": "2017-02-17T14:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T13:08:59.656+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
