'Biblical' manuscripts, which are copies of texts from the Hebrew Bible comprise 40 per cent of the haul.\nThe Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered in a caves in the limestone cliffs at Khirbet Qumran (pictured)\nOther religious manuscripts, including known documents from the Second Temple period like the books of Enoch, Jubilees, Tobit, and Sirach, that were now included in the Bible comprise 30 per cent of the identified scrolls.\nThe so-called 'Sectarian' manuscripts - previously unknown documents that shed light on the beliefs of Jewish groups of the time - like the Community Rule, War Scroll, Pesher on Habakkuk, and the Rule of the Blessing, make up the remaining 30 per cent.\nWhile some of the writings have survived as nearly intact scrolls, most of the archive consists of thousands of parchment and papyrus fragments.\nUntil now, experts believed that there were only 11 Dead Sea Scroll caves.\nDr Oren Gutfeld, who led the study, said: 'This exciting excavation is the closest we've come to discovering new Dead Sea scrolls in 60 years.\n'Until now, it was accepted that Dead Sea scrolls were found only in 11 caves at Qumran, but now there is no doubt that this is the 12th cave.\nResearchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Institute of Archaeology discovered the cave, which is the first found in over 60 years\nDuring an excavation of the site, the researchers discovered numerous storage jars and lids hidden in niches along the walls, which date back to the Second Temple period\n'Although at the end of the day no scroll was found, and instead we \"only\" found a piece of parchment rolled up in a jug that was being processed for writing, the findings indicate beyond any doubt that the cave contained scrolls that were stolen.\n'The findings include the jars in which the scrolls and their covering were hidden, a leather strap for binding the scroll, a cloth that wrapped the scrolls, tendons and pieces of skin connecting fragments, and more.'\nThe finding of pottery and of numerous flint blades, arrowheads, and a decorated stamp seal made of carnelian, a semi-precious stone, also revealed that this cave was used in the Chalcolithic and the Neolithic periods.\nFragments of scroll wrappings, a string that tied the scrolls, and a piece of leather that was part of a scroll were also found\nThe researchers believe the findings indicate beyond any doubt that the cave contained scrolls that were stolen\nThe excavation was part of a larger project, called 'Operation Scroll', which launched last year.\nIsrael Hasson, Director General of the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: 'The important discovery of another scroll cave attests to the fact that a lot of work remains to be done in the Judean Desert and finds of huge importance are still waiting to be discovered.\n'We are in a race against time as antiquities thieves steal heritage assets worldwide for financial gain.\n'The State of Israel needs to mobilize and allocate the necessary resources in order to launch a historic operation, together with the public, to carry out a systematic excavation of all the caves of the Judean Desert.'\nThe cave lies on the cliffs west of Qumran, near the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea\nRESEARCHERS 'VIRTUALLY UNWRAP' FRAGILE SCROLL Researchers have now used a new digital analysis technique on a burned, 1,500-year-old Hebrew scroll discovered over 45 years ago on the shores of the Dead Sea in Israel.\nPrevious studies have successfully identified text within ancient artefacts, but the En-Gedi manuscript represents the first severely damaged scroll to be virtually unrolled and non-invasively read, line by line.\nThe scroll shows two distinct columns of Hebrew writing that contain lines, words, letters and spacing.\nThis includes the phrases:\n- 'If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, a male'\n- 'without blemish he shall offer; to the entrance of the tent of meeting, he shall bring'\n- 'it is for acceptance on his behalf before the Lord. 'He shall lay his hand upon the head...'\nFurther analysis revealed the scroll's writings to be the book of Leviticus, which makes it the earliest copy of a Pentateuchal book ever found in a synagogue.", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz="], "published": "2017-02-08T18:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T02:41:25.258+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
