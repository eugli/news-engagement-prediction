Now my foundation is important for me. I have played with seriousness and in a professional way for my country.\" \nKnown for his swashbuckling batting and tricky leg-spin, Afridi's last match for Pakistan was the defeat by Australia in the World Twenty20 in Mohali in March 2016. \nDespite his intention to continue in the game's shortest format, he has not been selected since that defeat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T14:58:33.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
