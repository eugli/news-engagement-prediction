Comment on This Story Staff Photographer Western Michigan Broncos wide receiver Corey Davis (84) catches a pass in the open field against Wisconsin Badgers safety Leo Musso (19) during the first quarter of the 81st Annual Cotton Bowl Classic at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Monday, January 2, 2017. (Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News) By Matt Mosley , Special Contributor Contact Matt Mosley on Twitter: @mattmosley \nMatt Mosley, contributor to SportsDayDFW.com and columnist for Texas Monthly, answered questions during a live chat Tuesday. Here are some of the highlights: \nQ: Who winds up overpaying for Mo Claiborne? \nMosley: Philly? I don't see a huge market for him forming. There's a team that will sign him for a reasonable amount. If there's not a market for him, I think the Cowboys should try to sign him to a one-year deal. I'm serious. When he's healthy, he's been pretty solid lately. \nQ: Are there any under the radar NFL prospects that you're keeping an eye on as the combine nears? \nMosley: I know he's not under the radar to scouts, but some fans may not know Western Michigan WR Corey Davis yet. I sort of like him for the Cowboys because he's already a great route runner. He gets a lot of separation simply because he's an excellent technician. I think he could be a superb No. 2 WR if Terrance Williams leaves in free agency. The CB out of Washington, Sidney Jones, isn't getting a lot of props yet. I think he could be a solid starter for a long time. Cowboys draft pick Jaylon Smith shows√Ç off his knee's progress by hopping over hurdles \nQ: Jerry took some pretty big risks last draft with Jaylon Smith/Charles Tapper and Rico Gathers. Do you think he'll be as cavalier in this draft, especially with the Cowboys being so close to contending for a Super Bowl? (allegedly, anyways ha) \nMosley: They took Tapper in the fourth round, Rico late. Those aren't big risks at that point in the draft. Jaylon Smith was a huge risk, given his medical situation. That would one could turn out great if he recovers. I've seen those videos, but I don't think sense he'll be ready for OTAs or anything. And no I don't think Jerry's learned his lesson. If there's a player who's slipped for whatever reason, he'll take a long look at him. Now he may take a longer look at what will make Joe Mixon slip after having Hardy on campus for a few months. \nQ: Are you looking into the Cowboys' restructuring of the Tyron Smith/Travis Frederick deals as moves to free up money TO SPEND in free agency? Or were those moves just formalities? \nMosley: They haven't spent in free agency in several years. Carr may have been the last big-ticket item. The restructuring is just what happens at this time of year. They aren't loading up to go big in free agency.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T08:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:10:44.821+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
