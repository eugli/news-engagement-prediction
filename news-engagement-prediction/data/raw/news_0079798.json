Protesters 'crossed the line' \nAfter a long career in public life, Mr Doyle said he was used to public protests, but the noisy demonstration outside his home upset his wife and two-year-old son and their neighbours. \n\"I think though that someone's private home crosses a line that is unacceptable because I'm the one in public life,\" he said. \n\"My wife and two-year-old are not, nor are my neighbours and their children.\" \nAfter the protest Mr Doyle's neighbours were letter-boxed with incorrect information about what the city was doing to help the homeless. \nThe protesters have also launched a campaign to cover the city's streets in rubbish. \n\"I think this was a very irresponsible action and I think that's further underscored by the fact that their published material asks people to come in and trash the city,\" the Lord Mayor said. \n\"I mean that's just unacceptable.\" \nMr Doyle said he was talking to police about his security arrangements and would consider taking legal action against them if necessary. \nHe said professional protesters had hijacked the cause of the homelessness activists. \n\"It wasn't some spontaneous demonstration of homeless people themselves. These were professional protesters,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T11:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T07:54:22.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
