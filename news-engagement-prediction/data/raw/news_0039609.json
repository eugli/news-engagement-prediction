All the surveys were against Trump, but when he named Modiji in his broken Hindi — ‘acche din aane wale hain… Trump sarkar’ — he won the election. When Trump was asked after his victory how he would work, he replied, ‘I will work like Narendra Modi’,” says Joshi. \nFor all his claims, however, Joshi faces a tricky contest this time. \nIn Mussoorie, the Congress has pulled off a surprise by giving its ticket to Godavari Thapli, possibly the first instance of a national party putting up a Gorkha woman in Uttarakhand — the 1.28 lakh voters in in this constituency include nearly 30,000 Gorkhas. \nThapli is not new to politics, either. Having fought the Zila Panchayat and Mandi Samiti polls, she contested in the 2012 assembly elections as an Independent from Mussoorie and got 9,203 or 14 per cent of the votes cast. \nNot wonder then, that Thapli’s rallies have been drawing Gorkhas from neighbouring constituencies as well. \n“It’s the first instance of Gorkhas rallying behind the candidate of a national party,” says Sanjay Mal, who heads Gorkha International, a local community outfit. Shaktiman’s statue in Dehradun. \nJoshi claims that he got the OBC status for Gorkhas in the state. And that the local ex-servicemen association has promised its support, as he was one of them. But that claim rings hollow at Thapli’s rallies. “We are all with her. It’s a matter of Gorkha pride,” says M S Thapa, an ex-honorary captain in the Army. \nLocal Congress strongman, Jot Singh Gunsola, who won the Mussoorie seat in 2002 and 2007 before losing to Joshi in 2012, says, “I am totally with her. The party votes of Congress and the Gorkha votes are sufficient to ensure victory for Thapli.” \nThe Mussoorie contest, in a way, mirrors the BJP-Congress campaign in Uttarakhand. \nWith little central support, the Congress candidates are drawing on local issues and support. Here, it’s all about anti-incumbency against Joshi and “Gorkha pride”. But for Joshi, all that matters is Modi. “If we have such a leader, why does anybody have an objection to anything?” he asks. \nIn this frenzy, however, Joshi and Thapli have not spoken much about the real issues, say some residents. \n“Few leaders seem to realise the demands of the constituency, which has seen the deforestation of Oak trees… snowfall, which once recorded 9 feet, has now come down to just around 9 cm,” says Gopal Bhardwaj, Mussoorie-based historian and photographer. \n“Oak trees retain water and replenish the natural springs that supply water to the town. But Oaks are being replaced by Pines, which is disastrous for the hills,” he says. \n“Pines are widely being planted for commercial purposes and has affected the ecology. Pine sucks out water, but no one is concerned. The absence of snow and Oak indicate that Mussoorie will face an acute water crisis in the next few years,” warns Bhardwaj.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:10:16.668+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
