Bernie Sanders bristled at the idea that liberal protests against Donald Trump all over the country are analogous to the protests and demonstrations that marked the beginning of the tea party movement. \n“It’s not a tea party because the tea party was essentially funded by the billionaire Koch Brothers family,” Sanders said during an interview with NBC News’s Chuck Todd on Sunday on “Meet The Press.” “This is a spontaneous and grassroots uprising of the American people.” \nYeah, about that whole “spontaneous” thing. \nThat’s not really accurate. \nLiberal super PACs are busing people in to disrupt GOP town halls and we all know that Soros has his fingerprints everywhere . \nBernie is being pretty disingenuous by pretending this is all organic. \nAlso, how much property damage was done by tea partiers? Can you remind me? How many windows were broken? How many people arrested? \nI’ll give you a few minutes to think about it… LIKE this article?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:36:14.373+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
