It attacks Tishaura Jones, an opponent, for “consistently bad temperament and judgment.” \nMy translation: When a man speaks with assertiveness, that’s OK even if he should modulate a bit. When it’s a woman, the male ego is annoyed by a strong push back that objectively is just assertiveness. \nI’m a 73-year-old white male who mentored Jones when she was an outstanding executive trainee at Cardinal Glennon Children’s Hospital, part of SSM Health. In that organization, founded and run by women for decades, we understood the difference. Effective leadership often requires assertiveness to achieve a goal. \nThe Post-Dispatch interpretation of the actions of these two African-American leaders doesn’t reconcile as even-handed on gender. Jones holds her own with leadership assertiveness and demonstrated results. \nSteven M.
