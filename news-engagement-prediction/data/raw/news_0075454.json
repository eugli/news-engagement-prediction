It is not clear when or why he changed his name. Mr. Ranstorp said it was impossible for Mr. Bildt to be a defense and national security adviser in Sweden. “There is no such position in the Swedish hierarchy,” he said. “And he’s not even on the radar in Swedish security circles. And everyone knows everyone.” Nils Bildt på Bill O'Reilly Factor Fox News Video by Johan H Mr. Bildt’s time in the spotlight began last Thursday, when he appeared on “The O’Reilly Factor” to argue that immigrants were the cause of a violent crime wave in Sweden. Mr. O’Reilly said that claim was based on “hard news facts.” “There is a problem with socially deviant activity, there is a problem with crime, there is a problem with areas or hot spots of crime,” Mr. Bildt said. He added, “These things are not being openly and honestly discussed,” because Swedish politics is too “liberal.” That argument has been heard on Fox News before, perhaps most famously during a segment on Feb. 17 that inspired President Trump to add a line to his speech at a rally the next day that falsely suggested that there had been a terrorist attack in Sweden the night before. The president’s remark caused an unusual international incident between the United States and a mild-mannered ally. (Carl Bildt mocked Mr. Trump on Twitter the next day, asking, “What has he been smoking?”) Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound. https://t.co/XWgw8Fz7tj — Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) Feb. 19, 2017 Since then, the president has insisted that any report suggesting that immigrants were not causing problems in Sweden was “fake news.” Give the public a break - The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Feb. 20, 2017 Nils Bildt may not be a Swedish defense and national security adviser, but crime is a topic he may know a thing or two about. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Prosecutors in Virginia charged him in 2014 with public drunkenness and obstruction of justice, both misdemeanors, as well as one felony count of assaulting a police officer, according to court records. He was convicted of misdemeanor assault in November 2014 and sentenced to 12 months in prison, although his sentence was partly suspended. It is not clear how much time he spent in prison, if at all, or where he was held. David Tabacoff, the executive producer of “The O’Reilly Factor,” defended the decision to invite Mr. Bildt on the show. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.
