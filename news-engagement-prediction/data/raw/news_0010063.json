IP data points could show where the arrestees were the day of the protests\n'Asking for IP data could point toward a physical location—i.e. an apartment—that people stayed in and could widen the net for further prosecution of other protesters,' he said.\nDC officials have been criticized for the arrests that took place on inauguration day.\nProsecutors have dropped cases against nine individuals since January 20, including four journalists who were arrested while chronicling the actions of a group of self-described anarchists.\nLast week, one arrestee's Gmail account showed activity from his or her mobile phone, which is still in police possession.\nIt's not unusual for authorities to ask social media sites like Facebook and WhatsApp for data about users.\nLaw Enforcement officials in the United State requested information on the Facebook accounts of 38,951 users between January and June 2016 - the latest data available.\nThe majority of the requests were through search warrants and subpoenas, according to Facebook's government requests report.\nOfficials received data information in 80 per cent of cases.", "external_links": ["https://t.co/kpCPEwxLde", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=", "http://www.citylab.com/crime/2017/02/inauguration-protesters-targeted-for-facebook-searches/515517/", "https://t.co/Nei9RKH089", "https://twitter.com/georgejoseph94/status/828646944666959873"], "published": "2017-02-07T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T04:19:41.217+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
