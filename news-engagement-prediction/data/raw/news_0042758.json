Or will he continue to bury his head in the sand? \nWith the nurse at his health check having encouraged him to see his GP, Ian has been avoiding making an appointment for his test results and Jane and Dot continue to worry for him. Ian tries to distract himself by making plans for his birthday celebrations but Jane remains insistent that he gets in touch with the surgery. (Picture: BBC) \nAs the Vic arrange another theme event, Ian is prepared to get involved in the activities and prepares to run a pancake race with other residents but he is left worried when he receives a message telling him he needs to speak to his doctor about his results. (Picture: BBC) \nPushing the text to the back of his mind, Ian runs the race but with Kim Fox determined for victory, a competitive Ian pushes himself hard to try and beat her but ends up passing out.

When Jane later finds Ian writing his will, she tries her best to soothe him and put his fears at rest.
