The price rises were announced on Monday, but will not be put in place until Thursday 23 February. \n“We pay for everything we make in US dollars,” the California-domiciled Sonos said in a statement. “Over recent months, there has been a significant change on the US dollar to GBP exchange rate. As a result, our existing pricing has become unsustainable and, like many other companies, we have to increase prices for all products priced in GBP.” \nThe company’s key products, the Play:1, 3 and 5 speakers, are seeing prices rise by around 15% from £169/£259/£429 respectively to £199/£299/£499; its more specialist Connect line, which allows listeners to use Sonos technology to broadcast digital music through their pre-existing speaker set-up, is seeing the full 25% rise, from £279 for the Connect and £399 for the Connect:Amp to £349 and £499 respectively. \nSonos joins a growing list of technology companies announcing significant price increases following the vote to leave the EU. Apple was one of the first to move, with prices rising by around a fifth in October 2016 . Later that month, Microsoft increased its cloud-hosted service pricing, by up to 22% . In January, Apple moved again, increasing app prices by 25% . Companies which charge customers in dollars, such as Amazon Web Services, have also passed sterling’s collapse on to consumers .
