Mr. Schlapp reversed himself, but only after a conservative group opposed to the invitation circulated a video in which Mr. Yiannopoulos appeared to condone pedophilia. Mr. Yiannopoulos was also forced out of Breitbart. On Thursday came another telling clash. In a cavernous ballroom, as Dan Schneider, the A.C.U.’s executive director, took the stage to deliver a speech titled “The Alt-Right Ain’t Right at All,” scores of young attendees filed out. Though Mr. Bannon has called Breitbart a platform for the alt-right, Mr. Schneider condemned the alt-right as “a sinister organization that is trying to worm its way into our ranks, and we must not be duped.” The alt-right, he asserted to a silent, half-empty room, is a “hate-filled left-wing fascist group” that “hijacked the very term.” \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Outside the ballroom, Richard Spencer, director of the white supremacist National Policy Institute, who celebrated after Mr. Trump’s victory with his own conference at which he offered a “hail Trump” salute, was regaling two dozen reporters with the story of how he coined the term alt-right. (Organizers reportedly ousted him.) After Mr. Spencer’s appearance, one critic labeled the conference “Hollywood for Nazi People.” But most attendees brushed such negativity aside. “We got a Republican president! Maybe we should quit acting like victims, and be tickled pink it’s not Hillary Clinton,” said DeAnn Irby, a Never Trump voter from Texas. Ms. Irby’s friend Lauren Harger of Manhattan Beach, Calif., agreed, adding that conservatives repelled by Mr. Trump should ask themselves, “Why are you content to be losers?” As the event with Mr. Bannon and Mr. Priebus ended, Mr. Schlapp acknowledged reports that the two men weren’t getting along . Smiling, he coaxed Mr. Priebus, the former Republican National Committee chairman, and Mr. Bannon, the Grand Old Party’s marquee antagonist, to say something nice about each other — to do a “group hug.” Mr. Bannon managed something about Mr. Priebus making the trains run on time. Mr. Priebus, a standard-bearer of what was once the Republican establishment, called Mr. Bannon “very loyal,” “very consistent” and “a very dear friend. ... I cherish his friendship.” It could not have been clearer who was hugging whom. \nFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook and Twitter (@NYTOpinion), and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter .
