Joost van der Westhuizen in action against Australia in the 1995 Rugby World Cup \nPossessing an unusually large frame for a scrum-half - standing at 6ft 1in tall and weighing nearly 14 stone - Van der Westhuizen thrived during games of high intensity which required powerful running and aggressive defending. \nHis stature enabled him to challenge many forwards at breakdowns, especially when rucks were taking place, and suited South Africa's abrasive brand of rugby. \nA dramatic dive pass to a waiting outside-half was also a signature of his game. A diving pass was a signature of Joost van der Westhuizen's game \nVan der Westhuizen made his international debut in 1993, a year after the Springboks were re-admitted to the international arena after the end of apartheid rule. \nThere was a match-winning try on debut in a 29-26 victory over Argentina in Buenos Aires, a portent of the fairy tale to come. England head coach Eddie Jones pays tribute to former South Africa captain Joost Van der Westhuizen, who has died at the age of 45. \nSouth Africa hosted the 1995 World Cup and there would be a pot of gold at the end of the competition for the 'Rainbow Nation'. \nDuring that tournament, Van der Westhuizen enjoyed great success with winger Chester Williams by leading rapid attacks on the blind side of the scrum. Joost van der Westhuizen on the charge against Samoa \nBut the most enduring memory he provided was of him stopping Jonah Lomu, the fearsome 6ft 5in and 18 stone-plus All Blacks winger, in a hard-fought 15-12 World Cup final victory against New Zealand. \nLomu made a typical battering run from deep and defied several challenges before Van der Westhuizen hauled him down just outside the 22-metre line. Jonny Wilkinson goes head to head with Van der Westhuizen at the 2003 World Cup in Australia \nIt was a pivotal moment which set up the dream denouement to the day for South Africa, as president Nelson Mandela presented the World Cup to captain Francois Pienaar wearing a Springbok rugby jersey and baseball cap. \nVan der Westhuizen's continued excellence and leadership saw him named captain for South Africa's 1999 World Cup defence, but the Springboks suffered heartbreak in a semi-final defeat to Australia. Van der Westhuizen (R) in his final South Africa appearance against New Zealand in 2003 \nBy the time of his third World Cup in 2003 he was past his best, and South Africa were thrashed 29-9 by New Zealand at the quarter-final stage. \nIt was his 89th and final Test appearance, a Springboks record at the time. \nHe had also scored 38 Test tries, which stood as a South Africa record until Bryan Habana beat the mark at the 2011 World Cup. Joost van der Westhuizen in action during the 2003 Rugby World Cup quarter final between South Africa and New Zealand \nVan der Westhuizen became a rugby commentator after his playing career and was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 2007. \nHe became a member of the World Rugby Hall of Fame when the International Hall was merged with the IRB Hall of Fame in 2014. \nBy then, Van der Westhuizen had been confined to a wheelchair after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2011. Joost van der Westhuizen with England scrum-halves Richard Wigglesworth, Danny Care and Ben Youngs \nHe set up the J9 Foundation to raise awareness of MND and offer help to those families affected by it. \nVan der Westhuizen was estranged from his wife, the Afrikaans singer and media personality Amor Vittone, with whom he had two children, son Jordan and daughter.
