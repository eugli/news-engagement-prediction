We are talking about millions of ringgit being invested unknowingly, in these scams. \n\"After buying houses here, they claim to be cheated by the developer where in such instances, Bumiputera reserve land were sold to them,\" he told a press conference at Wisma MCA in Ampang, today. \nChong said the deals were made in their home country and when they came to Malaysia, they realised there were no proper deals, resulting in losses amounting to millions of ringgit. \nMeanwhile, Chong said the number of Chinese nationals being duped by local MLM businesses as also constantly growing. \nAccording to him, many of the victims fall for such scams after VIPs names were used. \n\"They (the scammers) will offer the victims something with super-returns and many, due to greed, have fallen into the trap. \n\"By the time they reach out for help, it is too late.They (the victims) have lodged police reports here, so we let the authorities handle their cases now,\" Chong said. \nHe stressed that there were proper guidelines to purchase property in the country and said those with doubt can always enquire with their lawyers or conduct checks with the Malaysian embassy in their home countries before getting into deals involving money. \n\"They can even enquire from us (MCA Public Services and Complaints Department) or our Malaysia-China Welfare Advisory Council which is recognised by the Chinese embassy here,\" he said. \n\nFor more news and views that matter, subscribe and support independent media for only RM0.36 sen a day: ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-20T16:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-20T11:54:18.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
