Locals know what the shop is but visitors don't.\" The self-help section in Waterstones Credit: Clara Molden \nM any shopkeepers in the town blame the arrival of national chains for pushing up rents and therefore affecting business rates, which are due to rise by an average of 177 per cent in area over the next five years. \nThe Waterstones store in Southwold is located in a Grade II listed building has a sign written in plain lettering on a light blue background above the front door, and on a traditional swinging sign. \nHowever, a small handwritten sign in the window states: 'Southwold Books is the trading name of Waterstones Booksellers Ltd'. \nChris Viner, 77, who works in a nearby studio that sells toy soldiers, said: \"I suspect Waterstones wouldn't have been able to set up shop if they had stuck a big sign on the front. The whole town would have been up in arms. They would have had their pitchforks out.\" \nClive Sawyer, 66, who owns a gallery a few doors along, added: \"Waterstones has crept in under the guise of a nice, independent book store, which it simply isn't. Ultimately, it's the dishonesty I really dislike.\" \nWaterstones has launched another two unbranded stores in Rye, East Sussex, and Harpenden, Hertfordshire. \nThe shops are said to be such a success that the chain is considering opening more. \nHowever, managing director James Daunt, denied that Waterstones was using \"subterfuge\" to attract customers, and said he wanted the company to have stores with their own identities. \nHe said: \"We don't pretend we are not Waterstones. The idea that this is some type of subterfuge is ridiculous.\" Follow Telegraph News ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T18:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T13:43:52.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
