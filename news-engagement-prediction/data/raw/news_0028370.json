He hasn't really said anything else,\" Taylor said. \nTaylor said he sought feedback in December when the T20 side was initially announced. \n\"I asked the question when I got dropped for Bangladesh and he [Hesson] said 'this is the best team that we feel for this tour against Bangladesh' and I suppose you've just got to respect the decision that he made. For this game I just heard I wasn't selected and I didn't ask any questions,\" he told Radio Sport . \nTaylor was instead picked for Tuesday's warmup T20 for the New Zealand XI to get a look at South Africa's bowlers before the five ODIs. \nHe said he would have to wait till his end of season review with Hesson to receive some feedback. \"We'll see what Hess has in store for me in my future in the team, I guess.\" Ad Feedback \nTaylor's last T20 international was at the world tournament in India last March, when New Zealand made the semifinals and he had a lean run of form with a top score of 36 not out. \nHe was largely used at No 5 as a finisher, the role now being given to his Central Stags team-mate Bruce who is one of the biggest hitters in New Zealand cricket and made a good fist of his debut series. \nTaylor felt after his December surgery to remove a growth on his eye he was seeing the ball well and believed he could justify a T20 spot on current form. \n\"I'd hope so. It's the best I've seen the ball for a long time. I underestimated how bad my eye was beforehand and how much it's improved over a short period of time. I dropped a few catches that I shouldn't have, but it's nice to actually see the ball for a change,\" he told Radio Sport . \nHe was buoyed by the comments of South Africa's ODI captain AB de Villiers who expressed surprise and relief Taylor wouldn't be opposing them in Auckland on Friday. \nSome family members sent him the video footage of the de Villiers interview, he said with laugh. \"It's nice to hear something from a world class player with a lot of integrity.\" \nStill, Taylor maintains the T20 snub won't prompt him to quit New Zealand Cricket in search of T20 riches. \nHe earlier confirmed he would enter the Indian Premier League auction but at age 32 is no guarantee of being picked up. \n\"I've always said to myself I can play till at least the 2019 World Cup. I still think I've got at least two-and-a-half to three years in me.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T01:24:40.923+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
