SHARE Drug offence: Kyle Lovett has avoided a conviction for having a small amount of cocaine.

Young people often experiment and do use a small amount of drugs. \n\"You should know that it's a danger, as it's quite commonly said, there's no quality control. \n\"I'm prepared to give you the benefit of leniency, it was a small quantity … you have an otherwise bright future.\" \nLovett is contracted with the Tigers until the end of 2017, but it was rumoured the club was attempting to force him out in a bid to ease salary-cap pressure. \nHe was supported by his parents and a team welfare officer in court, and thanked the magistrate as he left the courtroom.
