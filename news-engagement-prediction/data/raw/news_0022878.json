She believes there is a connection between a child's mind and places of calm and beauty to be used as a tool for us all.

Gardening teaches us the fundamentals in care and the evolution of living things, all while inspiring us to nurture our minds and to relax and strengthen our bodies. I hope that together Mrs. Abe and I can continue to inspire our youth to enjoy the beauty around them and to restore their minds in the peacefulness of their surroundings.\" Read More Trump will present Abe with the gift of a a porcelain rose, the \"Rose in Bloom,\" from Ukrainian-born American artist Vladimir Kanevsky.
