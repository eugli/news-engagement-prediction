Individuality was expressed primarily by the arrangement of straps of one's sweetheart neckline gown. Jewelry was tasteful, hair was elegant. Hopefully, we have a tackier 2017 to look forward to. Nicole Kidman \nBefore we get to the champagne parade that was the 2007 red carpet, here is Nicole Kidman. If I have learned anything about Kidman, it is that this woman gets her life on the Oscars red carpet. She probably wears Lacroix gowns in her spare time, sitting in a darkened room, periodically commanding her impeccably well-trained Australian Shepherd to pass her clutch so she can touch up her lipstick. Kate Winslet \nHere is Kate Winslet in our first pastel of the evening (certainly not our last!). She is wearing a gown the same color as my favorite Crayola marker: Sea Foam. She looks nice. Cameron Diaz \nYou might not immediately recognize America's sweetheart/Natalie Cook from Charlie's Angel's without her signature blonde hair. But that is, in fact, Cameron Diaz, wearing a gown about which I can't think of anything to say so I will not say anything at all!!
