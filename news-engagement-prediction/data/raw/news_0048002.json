But it's unique.\" \nRead more news for Birmingham and the Black Country Image copyright Stephen Calcutt Image caption Mr Calcutt said: \"What people would normally want to see [in the background] is out of focus, so I work against it - I've focused on the graffiti\" \nArmed with his Sony A600 camera, the amateur photographer was inspired while waiting for a bus in the city about six months ago, looking through a scratched acrylic window. \n\"I was actually annoyed because it was ruining the view,\" Mr Calcutt, from Solihull, said. \nBut he snapped away anyway, and when he loaded his images on to a computer at home, he saw they had potential. Image copyright Stephen Calcutt Image caption Mr Calcutt says he wants to start targeting bus stops near city landmarks \n\"Once I enhanced the colours, and played around with the shadow and contrast, they looked a bit like abstract paintings,\" Mr Calcutt said. \nHe entered some images to online gallery World Street Photography, and also contacted other galleries about his work, landing a spot in the annual exhibition of contemporary art in Chelsea, London. \nMr Calcutt travels around Birmingham for his job as a domiciliary care worker, and finds the richest spots for his photography in some of the busiest and noisiest urban areas.

Maybe one day there will be an altercation and I'll capture that,\" he said.

These pictures have the same effect. \n\"The graffiti is blocking the view. It's vandalism. But I'm making something positive out of something I don't agree with.\" Image copyright Stephen Calcutt Image caption Two of Mr Calcutt's photos will feature at the exhibition until 2 April Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:52:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T14:38:31.306+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
