Last night, the actor tweeted, “Dear Tommy. I don't wear you [brand's clothes], neither do my kids endorse you. If you have lost your spine, I have a great team to help you find it. Please (Hil)figure yourself out.” The photo was originally shot for a magazine. While the top bosses have not taken any further step, Hritihik, in a text message to hitlist, said, he won't puruse it. “No need to take it further”, read his message. The brand, till the time of going to press, hadn't issued any clarification. An insider said, “The American wing is yet to direct the Indian team on what to do next. An internal inquiry is expected to be conducted next week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T07:19:18.951+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
