He did not name the person he was eyeing for the position.

Bush, working on counter-terrorism. He also has combat experience on SEAL teams and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nHarward now works as an executive for defence contractor Lockheed Martin, with responsibility for its business in the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East.

SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link US President Donald Trump is reportedly trying to convince Robert Harward to change his mind on the position. Photo: Bloomberg \nWhen Harward was a commanding officer in Afghanistan, he was known for making his rounds without full body armour to send a message that Afghanistan was safe, said a US official who worked under Harward there. \n\"He had no ego,\" the official said, on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak. \nTrump knew of Flynn's Russia talks weeks ago \nTrump was aware that his national security adviser Michael Flynn had misled White House officials and Mike Pence for \"weeks\" before he was forced to resign on Monday night. \nTrump was briefed by White House Counsel Don McGahn that Flynn had discussed US sanctions with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak, despite his claims to the contrary, \"immediately\" after McGahn was informed about the discrepancy by the Department of Justice, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said in a media briefing. \nSally Yates, the acting Attorney-General at the time, and a senior career national security official at the Justice Department had informed McGahn at his office about their concerns on January 26, according to a person familiar with the briefing. Spicer said that the president and a small group of senior aides were briefed by McGahn about Flynn that same day. \n\"We've been reviewing and evaluating this issue with respect to General Flynn on a daily basis for a few weeks, trying to ascertain the truth,\" Spicer said. \nThe comments appear to contradict the impression given by Trump on Friday aboard Air Force One that he was not familiar with a Washington Post report that revealed that Flynn had not told the truth about the calls. \nSeparately, the New York Times reported that Pence first learned that Flynn had misled him about the nature of his contact with a Russian official on February 9, a full two weeks after other White House officials were briefed on the matter, according to an aide to Pence said on Tuesday. \nThe timing indicates that Pence would have become aware of the controversy around the same time that a Washington Post report was published, detailing the degree to which Flynn had been in contact with the Russian ambassador to the United States on the issue of sanctions, Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said. \nIn discussing Trump's awareness about Flynn's statements, the White House Counsel's office conducted a \"review\" of the legal issues and determined that \"there was not a legal issue but rather a trust issue,\" Spicer said. \"The President was very concerned that General Flynn had misled the Vice President and others. The President must have complete and unwavering trust of the person in that position.\" \nMore to come \nFairfax Media with Reuters, The Washington Post Related Content", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T01:42:01.918+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
