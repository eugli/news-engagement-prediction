GETTY One question asks how much the pupils worry about adults drinking too much at home \nMums and dads are even required to say whether they “dislike” their child, whether their child can be “sneaky or manipulative” and even if they are fit enough to climb stairs or push a vacuum cleaner. \nAlthough the surveys are anonymous, the answers will be linked to individual identity numbers and shared across the public sector - a move which critics say breaches the Supreme Court ruling on “intrusive data sharing” under the Named Person scheme. \nThe surveys are voluntary although some parents in Falkirk and North Lanarkshire, the two areas where they are currently being carried out, claim the choice is not properly explained. GETTY They are also asked how often they brush their teeth \nPatricia Vass, from Falkirk, said: “My eight-year-old daughter came home from school with a form regarding a survey that they were taking in school about wellbeing. There was a tear-off slip for parents to opt out within 10 days, but no date on the form, so no way of verifying the deadline.” \nShe said there were no links to the survey questions on the Realigning Children’s Services website, although they were eventually made available on Thursday following inquiries from the Scottish Sunday Express. \nMs Vass added: “I know from the Named Person court case that it was the data sharing element of the legislation that the Supreme Court ruled unlawful, and this survey is a fundamental part of that agenda.
