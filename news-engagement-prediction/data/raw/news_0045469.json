Internal investigation \nThe land and services department looks after services such as cleansing, bin collection, park, roads to environmental health and trading standards. \nThe department has about 4,000 employees and a revenue budget of £190m. \nIn November 2016 its executive director Brian Devlin - whose salary was about £120,000 - resigned after five years in the role.

Key theme \nHowever, Mears currently has no major contracts with Glasgow City Council and the company has denied wrongdoing. \nA spokesman for Labour-run Glasgow City Council said it would not be appropriate to comment on an ongoing internal investigation. \nThe broader issue of openness and transparency within Glasgow City Council is set to be a key theme in the campaign ahead of May's local elections. \nSupporters of the Labour administration may argue that the internal investigation demonstrates that they take such matters seriously. \nHowever, the SNP believe that, in general, the council could do more to ensure it is transparent and seen to be so. \nThe leader of the SNP group on the council, Susan Aitken, stressed she did not wish to comment on this specific investigation or any of the individuals concerned. Image caption Trust is set to be an issue at the local council elections in May \nHowever, she said: \"Glasgow SNP have already expressed serious concerns about public trust in the council in the light of a number of incidents over the years and have committed to appoint an independent expert to conduct a root and branch review of governance if elected.\" \nIn general, councils are expected to follow tight procurement rules and statutory procedures to ensure an open and transparent process is followed for any contract being awarded - major contracts also have to comply with EU law. \nThey should not be awarded on the basis of personal connections and no company tendering for a contract should be given an unfair advantage or disadvantage. \nIt would be seen as bad practice - and possibly a breach of rules - for anyone with a close personal connection to a company to be involved with decisions on whether or not they are awarded a contract. \nAny allegation a council employee was able to give one company bidding for work an unfair advantage, through for instance sharing information, would also be taken very seriously. \nRecommendations on who to award significant contracts to are made by council officials, although the actual decisions are taken by committees of councillors. It is unusual for these committees to go against the officials' recommendations. \nPolice Scotland said: \"A matter has been raised with the police and inquiries are at an early stage to assess this information.\" Related Topics", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T18:53:20.922+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
