Riewoldt set the tone early with a strong contested mark in the Saints’ defensive 50, starting the chain that led to the first goal of the match through Tim Membrey. \nPlaying mostly off a wing, he finished with 14 touches and six marks and had plenty of involvement in the Saints’ forward thrusts. \nWith 319 games and 689 career goals to his name, the former skipper looks set to continue making a significant impact.

He’s a remarkable player,” stand-in coach Adam Kingsley said. \n“It’s not luck — he works incredibly hard throughout the pre-season, week to week, working on his body, making sure he’s in top shape. \n“He’s got such a great competitive drive and work rate and mental toughness to be able to just continue to work when he’s tired. His contribution, whether it’s wing or forward, is terrific for us obviously.” \nThe five-time All-Australian this month handed over the captaincy to Jarryn Geary after 10 successive seasons in charge. \nLIVE stream every game of the JLT Community Series (the AFL preseason competition) on FOX SPORTS.

Jake’s a really versatile player. He can play tall or small. I thought we saw all aspects of that tonight.” \n- AAP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T07:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:35:57.627+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
