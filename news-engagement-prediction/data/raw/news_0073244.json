The Syrian force includes 27,000 members of the Y.P.G, a Kurdish militia , and 23,000 local Arab fighters. Turkish officials insist that the Kurdish fighters are linked with the Kurdistan Workers Party, which is regarded as a terrorist group by both Turkey and the United States. Hurtling across the sky in Osprey aircraft, three reporters were brought to this remote training area near Manbij by American commanders for a rare look at how some of new recruits are being trained. The new recruits are paid $100 a month, a sum their commanders assert their families will continue to receive if they are killed or disabled in battle. They ranged from an 18-year-old with a wispy beard to a 37-year-old from Qubissen, who said he had joined the militia after ISIS fighters killed his brother-in-law for smoking. A significant number were also women. Of the 185 recruits who were undergoing marksmanship training on Friday, 100 are assigned to the looming Raqqa offensive while the remainder were members of the security force that is intended to protect the newly liberated town of Manbij. American officers appear heartened there is an increasing number of recruits, but they also say that an assault against Raqqa would pit the lightly armed Syrian fighters against an enemy that is equipped with stolen Syrian tanks, antitank missiles and an abundant supply of car bombs. “They are essentially a light, irregular formation with fairly light weapons,” Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, who commands the American-led task force that is fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria, said of the Syrian fighters. “They are going to need additional combat power.” Photo Female Kurdish fighters being trained in Sanna, Syria.

Gordon/The New York Times To take on ISIS in its lair, American officers say the Syrian fighters will need antitank missiles, mortars, heavy machine guns and armored vehicles. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Nor is it feasible, the American officers say, to equip only Arab fighters with such weapons. American officials say that about 12,000 to 15,000 fighters will be needed to retake Raqqa, and the battle-hardened Kurds will need to be part of that fight as well. The recent history of the campaign against ISIS certainly suggests that the Kurds have the most experience on the battlefield. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
