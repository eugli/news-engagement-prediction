He adds that their diminutive size doesn't affect their ability to transfer data. \n\"They're five kilograms each but they're able to go up to two gigabits per second. \n\"It could potentially provide next generation-type applications such as telehealth, remote learning and high speed [data] transmission,\" he says. Test run \nThe pair of test satellites scheduled to launch in November won't provide \"real-time\" internet coverage — that requires a whole \"constellation\" of satellites spread out around the globe, pinging data from one satellite to the next. But Bishay says the two satellites will still have a short term benefit for some companies and organizations operating in the North. \n\"A lot of companies in the North that don't have access to any type of high speed internet, have to backup their data and actually fly it on a plane down south. \n\"With our November launch we can actually have them start at least backing up data… [as] every 90 minutes [the satellite] orbits the Earth.\" \nBishay says Kepler could service mining and oil companies, as well as organizations needing to upload weather or seismic data from remote locations. \nThe company intends to launch more satellites in incremental steps after November's test flight. Whether those satellites will focus on the North depends on whether the company can tap into a $500 million \"Connect to Innovate\" fund, established by the federal government to improve Northern internet access. Federal government spending $500M to expand high-speed Internet to remote communities \n\"As time moves on, then Northern Canadians will benefit from it, but that might not be our priority if we're not able to get support from the Canadian Government,\" says Bishay. \nHe says if they are able to secure government support, his company could have a network in place by 2021.
