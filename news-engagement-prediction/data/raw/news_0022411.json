(The Associated Press ) By Toronto Star staff Tues., Feb. 7, 2017 WASHINGTON—U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said that terrorist acts in Europe are going unreported. “All over Europe it’s happening,” he said. “It’s gotten to a point where it’s not even being reported.

The following is that entire, unedited list released by the White House , complete with the misspellings and errors of the original.
