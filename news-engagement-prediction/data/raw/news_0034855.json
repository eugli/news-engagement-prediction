If you turn up you get searched at the door, you walk up to the turnstile, you get searched. \n“But then you see in the ground at least 20 to 30 flares going off last night. What really narked me is in this day and age the way things are going on, if anybody sees that and wants to do something at Old Trafford they might think it would be easier to get in something bigger than a flare. \n“There were so many kids and women there last night. How did all of those flares get into the stadium?” \nSean Leeming, who attended the game, said: “It was incredible. I just can’t believe that every United fan got searched so thoroughly, yet they were able to get through the gates with dozens of flares and then set them off in the ground.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T13:48:03.790+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
