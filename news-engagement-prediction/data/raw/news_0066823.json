But the links at Minnewasta Golf & Country Club in Morden, Man. say otherwise. \nMinnewasta golf pro, Geoff Kelher, posted a picture on Twitter showing grass filled fairways on Tuesday. The unusual February sight comes following several days of above-normal temperatures. Amazing what some heat and a bit of rain can do in 6 days. pic.twitter.com/bXzOiNmefe \n— Minnewasta Golf (@MinnewastaGolf) February 21, 2017 \n“I was definitely surprised to see the grass come through the last few days,” Minnewasta Golf & Country Club pro,Geoff Kehler said. “Especially this year since we had a ton of snow.” \nKehler expects he’ll have to repair some water and ice damage come spring but says the early melt has put the golf course on par for a regular opening. \n“Looking two to three weeks ago, I would have thought we would be late,” Kehler said. “We should be able to welcome golfers now by mid-April.” \nBut don’t dust off your clubs just yet. Kehler says a light snowfall overnight has covered the course back up. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
