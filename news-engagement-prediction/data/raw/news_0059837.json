They were operating a ring from Pakistan, Malaysia and the UAE, Nepalese officials said. \nThe Indore-Patna Express went off the tracks near Kanpur Dehat in Pukhrayan on November 21, killing 148 and injuring more than 200 – the worst train accident in six years. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T18:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T13:49:03.431+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
