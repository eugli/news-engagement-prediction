The By the Sea actress flew to the country with her six children — Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8 — to promote her new film, First They Killed My Father . While spending time with BBC World News journalist Yalda Hakim, Angelina opened up about how she's coping since her split from Brad Pitt , calling the time \"difficult\" but insisting they will \"forever be a family.\" She also had some lighter moments when she cooked and ate tarantulas and scorpions with her kids, giving people a lovely glimpse into their everyday banter. Knox's reaction? \"[It tastes like] dry chips. Yeah, like, flavorless chips.\" Watch the whole exotic dining experience above (if you can stomach it).
