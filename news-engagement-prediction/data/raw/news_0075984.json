Antoinette Ursitti, a 16-year department veteran, has been appointed to lead the Criss Response Unit. \nIn 2016, there were nearly five times as many CIT-identified events as in 2015 as a result of the new training and enhancements to the computer-aided dispatch system, the mayor’s office said. \nThe training was developed by the city’s Office of Emergency Management and Communications in collaboration with the Chicago Police Department and the National Alliance on Mental Illness Chicago.
