Are we, he asks, “building the world we all want?” \nWhile most people now use Facebook to connect with friends and family, Mr. Zuckerberg thinks that the social network can also encourage more civic engagement, from the local to the global level. Facebook now has nearly 2 billion members, which makes it larger than any nation in the world. \n“Across the world there are people left behind by globalization, and movements for withdrawing from global connection,” Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook in a Harvard dorm room in 2004, wrote on Thursday. So it falls to the company to “develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us.” \nCONNECTING IN FACEBOOK’S INTEREST \nMr. Zuckerberg (32), told the AP that he still strongly believes that more connectedness is the right direction for the world. But, he added, it’s “not enough if it’s good for some people but it’s doesn’t work for other people. We really have to bring everyone along.” \nIt’s hardly a surprise that Mr. Zuckerberg wants to find ways to bring more people together, especially on Facebook. After all, getting more people to come together on the social network more frequently would give Facebook more opportunities to sell the ads that generate most of its revenue, which totaled $27 billion last year. And bringing in more money probably would boost Facebook’s stock price to make Mr. Zuckerberg already worth an estimated $56 billion even richer. \nAnd while the idea of unifying the world is laudable, some critics backed by various studies contend Facebook makes some people feel lonelier and more isolated as they scroll through the mostly ebullient posts and photos shared on the social network. Facebook’s famous “like” button also makes it easy to engage in a form of “one—click” communication that can displace meaningful dialogue. \nFacebook also has been lambasted as a polarizing force by circulating posts espousing similar viewpoints and interests among like-minded people, creating an “echo chamber” that can harden opinions and widen political and cultural chasms. \nCOMMUNITY SUPPORT \nToday, most of Facebook’s 1.86 billion members about 85 percent live outside of the U.S. and Canada. The Menlo Park, California-based company has offices everywhere from Amsterdam to Jakarta, Indonesia, to Tel Aviv, Israel. (It is banned in China, the world’s most populous country, though some people get around the ban.) Naturally, Mr. Zuckerberg takes a global view of Facebook and sees potential that goes beyond borders, cities and nations. \nAnd that could allow the social network to step up as more traditional cultural ties fray. People already use Facebook to connect with strangers who have the same rare disease, to post political diatribes, to share news links (and sometimes fake news links ). Facebook has also pushed its users to register to vote, to donate to causes, to mark themselves safe after natural disasters, and to “go live .” For many, it’s become a utility. Some 1.23 billion people use it daily. \n“For the past decade, Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families. With that foundation, our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all,” he wrote. \nLONG VIEW \nMr. Zuckerberg has gotten Facebook to this position of global dominance one that Myspace and Twitter, for instance, never even approached partly thanks to his audacious, long-term view of the company and its place in the world. \nLast fall, Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife, the doctor Priscilla Chan, unveiled the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative , a long-term effort aimed at eradicating all disease by the end of this century. Then, as now, Zuckerberg preferred to look far down the road to the potential of scientific and technological innovations that have not been perfected, or even invented yet. \nThat includes artificial intelligence, which in this case means software that’s capable of “thinking” enough like humans to start making the sorts of judgments that Facebook sometimes bobbles. Last September, for instance, the service briefly barred the famous Vietnam War-era photograph dubbed “Napalm Girl” because it featured a nude child, and only reversed its decision after users including the prime minister of Norway protested. \nAI systems could also comb through the vast amount of material users post on Facebook to detect everything from bullying to the early signs of suicidal thinking to extremist recruiting. AI, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote, could “understand more quickly and accurately what is happening across our community.” \nSpeaking to the AP, Mr. Zuckerberg said he understands that we might not “solve all the issues that we want” in the short term. \n“One of my favorite quotes is this Bill Gates quote, that ‘people overestimate what they can get done in two years and underestimate what they can get done in 10 years.’ And that’s an important mindset that I hope more people take today,” he said.
