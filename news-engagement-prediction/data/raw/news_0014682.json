There was no water in the cage. The ferret looked lifeless.\n“It was curled up with no water and nobody was in the vehicle.”\nWhen questioned, Rigley said he had been given the ferret only 24 hours before.\nJames Buckley, defending, said: “He said to the inspector how sorry he was for what happened. It was largely an accident.\n“At the time, he was not living at a settled address and spent a lot of time sleeping in his car and sofa surfing.\nView photos\nThe animal was forced to sit in temperatures of 40 degrees centigrade with no food or water (SWNS) More “He had the ferret for only about a day and was given it by a colleague. He had been given a food bowl, milk and planned to keep it for the long term.\n“He went to stay at a friend’s house and accepts this was the hottest day of the year.\n“His car was in the shade but because it was such a hot day it didn’t afford the animal any protection. When he was relayed the fate of the animal, he was very upset.\n“Everyone is aware of what happens to dogs in hot cars but as far as other animals are concerned, it is by no means obvious.”\nRigley, from Cotgrave, Nottinghamshire was jailed for six weeks after he admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. He is already in prison on another matter.\nAs well as the prison sentence, Rigley was also ordered to pay a total of £215.\nTop pic: SWNS", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4GXGaLs5Wb1qkg1TuHqhKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTEw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/9f48376b0f580eda62f2f9d751c9033e);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4GXGaLs5Wb1qkg1TuHqhKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTEw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/9f48376b0f580eda62f2f9d751c9033e", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MnfLkYYQ0tK9VIrxNVonxg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTYx/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ac0e550f2e620f299b0c5970b5dfc2f7", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MnfLkYYQ0tK9VIrxNVonxg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTYx/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ac0e550f2e620f299b0c5970b5dfc2f7);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0NnHPYxJ0g._IWmgRUeHMw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTUz/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/fda33b1a04667af8eb4f924ea9301533"], "published": "2017-02-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T13:57:49.966+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
