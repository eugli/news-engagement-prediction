Of that number, 90 percent live in developing countries where there are fewer opportunities for prevention and cure. \nThe vast majority of forms of blindness are preventable.\nREAD MORE: Uganda: Onchocerciasis-river blindness along the Agogo \nThe lead cause of blindness in the developing world is cataracts, which can be congenital (from birth), or caused by trauma to the eye later in life. The operation to remove cataracts is both simple and cheap.\nA single eye surgeon can carry out thousands in a year, each one taking as little as 10 minutes.\nYet, in places like the east African island of Zanzibar, where there is not a single paediatric eye surgeon, and much of the population lacks the access or the funds to receive the vision-saving operation, many continue to suffer needlessly.\nThe NGO Sightsavers has been funding a team of surgeons and medical specialists from the Tanzanian mainland who visit four times a year to carry out mass child-cataract operations. \nTwo-year-old Bakir Rashid underwent the surgery in September 2016. \nREAD MORE: Blind massage therapists offer relief from war in South Sudan \n\nTwo-year-old Bakir Rashid is guided by his sister on a bicycle. Rashid was born with bilateral congenital cataracts and is severely visually impaired. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nBakir stares at the TV in his home in Zanzibar. While he can make out vague shapes and colours, he lacks the ability to pick up any details. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nBakir sits on his mother’s lap as she prepares tea. His condition has left him unable to live a normal life; he is completely dependent on others for even the most basic tasks. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nSightsavers staff pin up an eye-test chart at a school in northern Zanzibar. Baker’s case was picked up through one of these outreach camps designed to identify those with cataracts along with other forms of visual impairment. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nDr Paul Nyaluke inspects a patient's eyes during a week of intensive eye operations at the Mnazi Moja hospital in Zanzibar. Nyaluke visits the island four times a year to operate on child cataract cases. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nDr Nyaluke takes notes after an eye consultation. Congenital cataracts develop over time, become larger and more opaque if left untreated. After the age of about eight, most congenital cataract patients will have irreparably damaged vision. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nBakir lies on the operating table ahead of his surgery, which will take place under a general anaesthetic. The team of surgeons, visiting from mainland Tanzania, will carry out around 70 operations this week. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nA surgical assistant hands an instrument to Dr Paul Nyaluke as he removes the cataracts from Bakir’s eyes and inserts new lenses. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nAfter his operation, Bakir recovers with his mother in the children's ward of Mnazi Moja hospital. The procedure involves minimal disruption to the eye, and patients can recover within a day or two. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nTwo days later, Bakir is driven back home from the hospital in a Sightsavers vehicle. His eyes, which have developed a squint over time, will take some time to adjust to the light, but already his vision is clearer. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nA week after his surgery, Bakir’s family take him to a local beach for a day out before being fitted for glasses; Bakir’s sight is still not perfect. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nAfter being fitted for spectacles, Bakir experiments with his new-found sight with his mother at their home in Zanzibar. He can now identify neighbours by sight from 80 yards away. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nBakir watches a Tanzanian TV drama with his mother and sister. Three months after his surgery, his eyes can now make out every detail on the screen. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nBakir plays with a pair of curtains at his home in Kisauni, Zanzibar, days after being fitted with spectacles. He must now re-learn how to navigate his world using his sense of sight. [Tommy Trenchard/Al Jazeera]\nBakir explores the previously unknown wonders of the banana grove in his garden, three months after his cataract operation.
