Comcast said it had reached an agreement to resume broadcasting Yankees and Nets games this spring. The Yankees hosted the Houston Astros on Opening Day of the 2016 season. (John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) \nComcast had ceased carrying YES in November 2015, forcing many Yankees and Nets fans to watch games somewhere else. In a statement Monday, Comcast said a new deal had been reached. \n\"We always said that we would continue to evaluate whether there was a way to bring back the YES Network under terms that are consistent with our commitment to providing the best programming at the best possible price,\" the statement read. \"Our year-end discussions with FOX gave us a chance to revisit this, and we were able to reach an overall agreement for FOX News Channel, 12 FOX (regional sports networks), and YES Network that makes sense for both of us - and most importantly, our customers.\" \nA Comcast spokesman, John Demming, said a precise date had not been scheduled for resumption of Yankees and Nets broadcasts. But Demming said baseball and basketball games would begin airing at the same time sometime this spring, early in the Yankees' 2017 schedule, and late in the Nets' 2016-2017 season. \nYES did not respond to requests for comment Monday afternoon. \nMeanwhile, another cable dispute remains unresolved. \nNegotiations between NBCUniversal and Charter Spectrum have been extended, holding off a potential television blackout that could have left scores of New Jersey households without NBC channels. \nNBCUniversal issued a statement over the weekend insisting that, \"We will continue to negotiate in good faith so that Charter Spectrum customers can continue to receive NBCUniversal's valuable networks and we hope to be able to reach a deal.\" \nSteve Strunsky   @SteveStrunsky .
