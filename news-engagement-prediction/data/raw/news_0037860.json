Source: Facebook/ North Vic Engines Redback spider takes down baby snake in losing battle \nThe gripping video has been met with criticism after numerous viewers accused the workers who recorded the battle of sticking the reptile with a fishhook to stop slithering off on the arachnid. \n\"We had a visit today from a baby snake,\" mechanics at North Vic Engines in Cobram wrote on Wednesday's Facebook post. \n\"Lucky our pet redback found it and killed it for us!\" The spider caught itself a snake. Source: Facebook/North Vic Engines Cobram \nDespite having the advantage of size and weight, the brown snake was outmatched by the relatively large spider that had strong webbing and knew how to use it. \nOnce the snake was ensnared, the spider's venom made short work of it, delivering the \"kill shot\" before the mechanics got back to work. \nThe video has been viewed 1.9 million times since it was posted, with many top comments accusing the engine mechanics in the border town of rigging the fight in favour of their pet spider. The baby brown snake was no match for the smaller spider.

Many viewers said the snake had a fishhook in its neck, preventing it from escaping. Source: Facebook/North Vic Engines Cobram \n\"They're only little tiny things,\" he said of the baby brown. \nTwo more baby snakes had been spotted since coming across the spider bait on Wednesday. \nTo prove \"the haters\" wrong, the mechanics posted another video on Thursday morning showing another baby snake wrapped up well and truly in a spider's web.
