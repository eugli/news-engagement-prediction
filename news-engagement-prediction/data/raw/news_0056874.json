Kornmesser An artist's impression of the TRAPPIST-1 planetary system. Seven rocky, Earth-size planets have been found circling TRAPPIST-1, a red dwarf star about the size of Jupiter. \nA few of the worlds might even be habitable. \nThe monumental discovery has prompted scientists to launch a website for the planetary system - and yes, it has an equally monumental domain: trappist.one . \nResearchers inspired by the new planetary system, which is about 39 light-years from Earth, are using trappist.one to publish fiction, artwork, and even poetic prose about it. \nOne poem by Sean Raymond , an astronomer at the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux who co-authored a study in Nature about the planetary system, caught our eye. \nCalled \" Ode to 7 orbs \", it beautifully explains the discovery and importance of TRAPPIST-1's seven planets. \nRaymond gave Business Insider permission to share his work, which we've reproduced here with a few illustrative additions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T01:00:47.424+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
