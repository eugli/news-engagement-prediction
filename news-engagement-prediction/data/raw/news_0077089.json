That means Mardi Gras parades, and the city’s newest sports star – DeMarcus Cousins – is making himself right at home. \nCousins and new teammate Anthony Davis were named honorary grand marshals for the Zulu parade, and Cousins – acquired nine days ago in a trade with the Kings – seemed to be enjoying himself quite a lot Tuesday morning. \nWe know that because he was wearing a pair of yellow panties on his head. It's safe to say that @boogiecousins is having no problems adjusting to New Orleans. He's currently riding in Zulu with panties on his head. pic.twitter.com/F9TZC0DjwP \n— Emma Discher (@EmmaDischer) February 28, 2017 \nDavis and fellow Pelican Tim Frazier joined Cousins on the float. The three will try to get their first victory with Cousins – New Orleans Is 0-3 since the trade – Wednesday against the Pistons.
