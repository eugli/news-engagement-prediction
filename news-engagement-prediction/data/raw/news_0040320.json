One day, they found that a frightened but friendly dog , someone had apparently left there, was wandering around the construction site. \nThey got the dog — now named Negão — veterinary care and decided to adopt him. Negão also got a new job. \n“Negão waits for people to arrive, and then goes up to say hello, winning them over with his charms,” Plannerer told The Dodo. “ Customers love him . Some people even bring him toys.” Sabrina Plannerer Forget employee of the month, Negão is clearly employee of the century. \nClad in a hat and official employee badge, Negão has made the gas station his permanent home.
