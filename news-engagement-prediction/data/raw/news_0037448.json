We forecast the Maltese economy will keep growing at a faster pace than the 'A' median at an average 3.3% over 2017-2018 \n“We forecast the Maltese economy will keep growing at a faster pace than the 'A' median at an average 3.3% over 2017-2018, supported by strong employment growth, rising disposable income due to continuous wage appreciation and the launch of new investment projects in the health, education and transport sectors. \n“Strong export performance in the pharmaceutical, remote gaming, financial services and tourism sectors will help maintain a solid current account surplus over 2017-2018 despite higher import-intensive investments related to the new EU funding cycle.” \nMalta's external position compared favourably with 'A' rated peers, with a net international investment position estimated at 47% of GDP at end-2016. \nReal GDP growth was revised up by 4.9pp in 2014 and 1.3pp in 2015, following national accounts revisions published by the National Statistical Office in December 2016. \nThis was mainly due to upward revisions to non-residential construction and machinery and to service exports, notably from the gaming industry. \nThis led to a substantial improvement in the public debt/GDP ratio and to an upward revision of potential GDP growth to 5.4% in 2016, reflecting higher estimates of total factor productivity. \nMalta's gross general government debt fell to an estimated 59% of GDP at the end of 2016 from 60.8% in 2015 due to high revenues from excise duties, income tax and the International Investor Programme (IIP). We project the fiscal deficit to narrow in 2017 to 0.5% of GDP from an estimated 0.7% in 2016 \n“We expect it to decrease to 56% in 2018, on the back of an improved primary surplus and strong nominal GDP growth, still higher than the 'A' median of 52% of GDP. \n“We project the fiscal deficit to narrow in 2017 to 0.5% of GDP from an estimated 0.7% in 2016.” \nThe agency said robust economic growth and additional indirect tax measures would boost tax revenues and offset more moderate revenue from the IIP, increased expenditure related to the EU presidency and lower tax on pensions. \nThe agency noted that no further capital transfer had been budgeted for Air Malta as the government expected private investors to take a stake in the company this year. \n“We believe the deficit will remain stable in 2018 as higher absorption of EU funds enables lower public investment, while revenues from the IIP decrease. \nGovernment-guaranteed liabilities, it said, remained among the highest in the European Union at 14.8% of GDP at the end of 3Q16, although they were set to decrease to 11.9% of GDP at end-2017, when the temporary guarantee granted to ElectroGas for the construction of a new power station expired. \nMost guarantees related to profitable companies, including the utility company Enemalta, Freeport Group Corporation and Malta Industrial Parks. \nMalta's banking sector remained profitable, liquid and well capitalised, albeit highly concentrated, with core banks representing 219.5% of GDP as at the end of September 2016. \nAsset quality improved with non-performing loans decreasing to 5.6% of total loans at end-September 2016, and the agency expected it to improve further. \nA sharp correction in the housing market constituted the main domestic risk to financial stability given the large exposure of the banks to the sector through mortgage lending and real estate collateral. \nHowever, the rise in house prices had moderated and the pace of mortgage lending decreased to 6.2% as at the end of September 2016 from 11% a year earlier. \nThe agency noted that future developments that could individually or collectively, result in positive rating action include: A longer track record of consolidating the public finances that led to a lower government debt/GDP ratio. A significant decline in contingent liabilities or a low likelihood that these contingent liabilities materialised. Progress in addressing key weaknesses in the business environment. \nFuture developments that could individually or collectively, result in negative rating action included: Significant slippage from fiscal targets leading to deteriorating public debt dynamics. Crystallisation of material contingent liabilities or a shock to the banking sector that required fiscal support. \nFitch assumed that in case of need, the Maltese government would only be predisposed towards supporting the core domestic banks that were systemically important, in particular Bank of Valletta (109% of GDP at-end 2016). \nFor HSBC Bank Malta (81% of GDP), Fitch believed that any necessary support would come from its parent company. « Photos of the week - Times of Malta Today's newspapers in review » Advert <a href='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/ck.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=90542645612&n=d53fe3e0' target='_blank'> <img src='https://ads.timesofmalta.com/www/delivery/avw.php?what=620x75,_highlighted|620x75&campaign=0&cb=90542645612&n=d53fe3e0' border='0' alt=''/> </a> \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T13:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T09:19:08.371+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
