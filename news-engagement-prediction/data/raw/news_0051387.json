In the 1997 election that brought Tony Blair to No 10, Labour won Copeland with 58.2% of the vote. That fell consistently until the 2015 election, when Labour won the seat with just 42.3% of the vote. The figures for Stoke Central are even more stark: in 1997 Labour won with 66.2% of the vote. Tristram Hunt held it for Labour in 2015 with just 39.3%. The 2015 election was held four months before Corbyn became Labour leader.\nThe Labour trajectory in both these seats was not untypical. Its core supporters were showing their rejection of failed Tory-lite domestic policies and disastrous foreign interventions.\nSince then Corbyn and John McDonnell and a very promising crop of youngish shadow cabinet members have begun the process of reconstituting the Labour party as an anti-austerity party with an ethical foreign policy, and have overseen the largest membership rise in the party’s history. All this has been achieved even as many of the PLP, whose own majorities have been slashed, have fought tooth and nail to undermine Corbyn and McDonnell’s project. It was that huge rise in membership that enabled Labour to have enough canvassers to knock on every single door in Stoke Central last weekend.\nIf Labour fails in Stoke or Copeland, I’ve no doubt we will read that it was “Corbyn’s fault”. If, as I suspect, they succeed, we will read that this was down to “local factors”.\nDavid Rosenberg\nLondon\n• Joan Smith ( The fragile male ego in politics is a dangerous weapon , 20 February) illustrates the danger of weaponising the language of psychoanalysis and feminism against men she disagrees with. While many might go along with the pop psychology of her Donald Trump analysis, to extend this to Jeremy Corbyn on the flimsiest of “evidence” is irresponsible.\nAs a feminist political economist, I find this casual and superficial appropriation of serious academic disciplines and their associated concepts supremely unhelpful. Does she never stop to think that Corbyn may occasionally appear irritated with the mainstream media because academic analyses, for example from the London School of Economics ( Cammaerts et al 2016 ), show consistent media bias against him, as indeed her article and the Guardian in general unfortunately demonstrate? Why is referencing his mandate about “wounded, self-pitying masculinity” rather than just evidence-based fact and a belief that democracy is for life and not just for when your side wins? Why is the gender balance of his first shadow cabinet evidence of a “fragile male ego” when, as the article says, this is something he has since rectified?\nEvidence, please, if you are going to do a character assassination. Come off it, Joan, it’s almost as if you want to help Labour lose the forthcoming byelections and tank in the polls.\nCathy Devine\nSenior lecturer, University of Cumbria\n• Dear Jeremy Corbyn , I am a 93-year-old retired and widowed aviator, a survivor of Bomber Command in the second world war. You were elected as Labour leader by a huge majority, but the general public know little about you. Constant media exposure is absolutely necessary for you to gain popularity, and yet at times you behave almost like a recluse. So many of your colleagues, friends and enemies, are carrying hidden daggers, and unless you exert far greater discipline, many of them will never accept you as leader.\nWith the Conservatives so far ahead in the polls, you now have to gamble all your resources to get a winning “poker hand” – and you haven’t a hope of achieving that in time to become prime minister unless you change tactics.\nMost of your supporters, former and present, are just waiting for the day when a new radical Labour party will emerge, to kick out this uncaring government. Get some lessons on presenting a more forceful image. Theresa May always runs rings around you in parliament. Whatever mistakes Tony Blair made, he was an articulate leader and the public admired him for his obvious principles of caring for them and trying to improve their lives. You appear to them to be the understudy who will never be on centre stage.\nMy suggestion is that you issue your party manifesto now – and it will have to be very radical. Do not mention socialism, public ownership or nationalisation. Pledge to form a new secular democracy, with a written constitution, with co-operatives and mutuals replacing the failed capitalist system; to return to the people the land that their ancestors fought for in two world wars. Bring a federal UK out of the middle ages and into a bright 21st century for the present and future generations. Give some hope to my children and grandchildren for a better future.\nIt will accelerate my death if ever this Conservative government is re-elected.\nGerald Davies\nBournemouth\n• Re John Harris’s article ( The biggest threat to Labour is devotees losing faith , 10 February), just about the only thing going for Labour is the massive increase in membership since the 2015 general election, if seemingly only for the income for the party coffers.\nThe reaction to this varies from mere indifference to outright hostility towards the thought of any input from new members – a 500% increase since 2015 in some branches – as well as imaginary plots by Momentum to “take over” branches (that were moribund in 2015) and manoeuvres on party rules to limit selection eligibility to 50% of members. These are procedural tactics worthy of the SWP, and the question remains; what is the point of it all? There is no right for the Labour party to exist, regardless of the views of the old guard who brought us the outcomes in 2010 and 2015. Just waiting for the current leadership to fail, while ignoring the potential of mass party support to develop and change policy, runs the risk of having nothing to revive next time round. A whole different level of incompetence, intolerance and indifference.\nAndy Sellers\nStockport\n• I am a lifelong Labour devotee, supporter of Jeremy Corbyn and a member of Momentum. John Harris says many members are losing faith and are at their wits’ end over Brexit. They should not, and Harris should report the vision that Corbyn has in working with European-wide socialist groups to create a better, more equal society protecting workers’ rights and wellbeing for all.\nJohn Haworth\nVisiting professor in wellbeing, University of Bolton\n• Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n• Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters\nJeremy Corbyn Labour Stoke Central Stoke-on-Trent Nuclear power Tony Blair letters ", "external_links": ["http://www.lse.ac.uk/media@lse/research/Mainstream-Media-Representations-of-Jeremy-Corbyn.aspx", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F21%2Fis-jeremy-corbyn-responsible-for-all-labour-troubles%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_gp&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;wwc=1", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Is%20Jeremy%20Corbyn%20responsible%20for%20all%20Labour%E2%80%99s%20troubles%3F%20%7C%20Letters&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F21%2Fis-jeremy-corbyn-responsible-for-all-labour-troubles%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_tw", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?app_id=180444840287&href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F21%2Fis-jeremy-corbyn-responsible-for-all-labour-troubles%3FCMP%3Dshare_btn_fb", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&title=Is%20Jeremy%20Corbyn%20responsible%20for%20all%20Labour%E2%80%99s%20troubles%3F%20%7C%20Letters&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F21%2Fis-jeremy-corbyn-responsible-for-all-labour-troubles", "http://www.pinterest.com/pin/find/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fpolitics%2F2017%2Ffeb%2F21%2Fis-jeremy-corbyn-responsible-for-all-labour-troubles"], "published": "2017-02-22T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:28:19.142+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
