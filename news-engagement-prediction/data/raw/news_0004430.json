Teammates congratulate Thornton's Mario Brown on his game-winning 3-pointer on Friday. (Jim Karczewski / Daily Southtown) Privacy Policy \nThornton's Mario Brown struggled mightily with his jump shot Friday night. \nBut with the game on the line against upset-minded Lincoln-Way West, Brown delivered when the Wildcats needed it most. \nThe junior guard hit an off-balance 3-pointer with 10 seconds remaining in the game to lift host Thornton to a 47-46 SouthWest Suburban Red victory. \nLincoln-Way West (5-15, 3-5) had a chance to win the game, but Nolan Green's 15-foot jumper at the buzzer was off the mark. \nThe 6-foot-2 Brown suffered through a 1-for-12 effort from 3-point range before sinking the winning three for Thornton (15-4, 7-0). \n\"I wasn't knocking down shots but I was in the game for a reason,\" Brown said. \"Every shot I took (Friday) I had confidence was going in, but they just didn't fall. That last one did fall. I just let it loose.\" \nJunior guard Delonte Jones admitted he had some doubt when Brown let the shot go. \n\"The whole game he wasn't feeling it,\" Jones said. \"But he's the best shooter on the team. He can hit any shot. He saved us.\" \nOn most occasions, Thornton coach Tai Streets would have designed a play for senior guard Alonzo Verge, who is averaging 22.4 points. \nBut Verge, along with two other starters, Christian Anderson and John White, sat out due to a team rules violation. \nFor most of the game, their absence was glaring. \nStreets, though, had confidence other players, such as Brown, eventually would step up. \n\"Guys are crying about playing time, well this was their chance to do something,\" Streets said. \"Brown stepped up and made the shot.\" \nThe Warriors led by eight at the half and by as many as nine, 28-19, in the second half. \nThe three-headed monster of Lewis recruit Marco Pettinato, Austin King and Green were giving the Wildcats fits. Pettinato finished with 18 points, King with 12 and Green with seven. \nWest alternated between a 1-3-1 zone and man-to-man defense that caused problems for Thornton (15-4, 7-0). \n\"They did a good job switching defenses,\" Streets said. \"They also had guys making shots. Marco is one of the best players in the state. But we raised our intensity level and got some momentum in the third quarter.\" \nKing drilled a three with 2:07 to play to give the Warriors a 46-43 lead. \nAfter the Wildcats closed to within 46-44, West had a chance to extend its lead but missed the front end of a 1-and-1 opportunity with 33.3 seconds to go. \nMoments later, Brown hit the game-winner. \nOrlando Allen Jr. led Thornton with 17 points, including 10 in the second half. Jones added 14 points. \n\"The coaches and my teammates told me they needed me and that I needed to knock down shots,\" Brown said. \"That was the biggest shot of my career.\" \nTwitter @disabato", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-04T10:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-04T06:47:38.092+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
