The shift is not sudden or dramatic, as in the 2004 sci-fi movie \"The Day After Tomorrow,\" but it is a real effect that has ... Climate change caused by ocean, not just atmosphere, study finds October 24, 2014 \nMost of the concerns about climate change have focused on the amount of greenhouse gases that have been released into the atmosphere. Climate change will affect carbon sequestration in oceans, model shows September 7, 2005 \nAn Earth System model developed by researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign indicates that the best location to store carbon dioxide in the deep ocean will change with climate change. Scientists find deep-ocean evidence for Atlantic overturning decline February 17, 2015 \nA new study has found evidence from the deep ocean that the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation – a system of currents that brings warm water from the tropics to the North Atlantic region and keeps its climate more ... New study questions long-held theories of climate variability in the North Atlantic October 15, 2015 \nA University of Miami (UM) Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric-led study challenges the prevailing wisdom by identifying the atmosphere as the driver of a decades-long climate variation known as the Atlantic Multi-decadal ... Super-slow circulation allowed world's oceans to store huge amounts of carbon during last ice age June 27, 2016 \nThe way the ocean transported heat, nutrients and carbon dioxide at the peak of the last ice age, about 20,000 years ago, is significantly different than what has previously been suggested, according to two new studies. The ... Recommended for you Researchers determine why the ocean has absorbed more carbon over the past decade February 8, 2017 \nWith the ocean absorbing more carbon dioxide (CO2) over the past decade, less of the greenhouse gas is reaching the Earth's atmosphere. That's decidedly good news, but it comes with a catch: Rising levels of CO2 in the ocean ... Random radiation clouds found in atmosphere at flight altitudes February 8, 2017 \n(Phys.org)—A large team of researchers with members from several institutions in the U.S., Korea, and the U.K. has found evidence of random radiation clouds in the Earth's atmosphere at elevations used by aircraft. In their ... Study breathes new life into 2.3 billion year old 'Great Oxidation Event' February 8, 2017 \nResearch led by the University of St Andrews and published yesterday (Monday 6 February) in Nature – provides new insight into how life evolved alongside changes in the chemistry of Earth's surface. These researchers examined ... Deep groundwater aquifers respond rapidly to climate variability February 8, 2017 \nChanges in climate can rapidly impact even the deepest freshwater aquifers according to Penn State and Columbia University hydrologists. Hidden lakes drain below West Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier February 8, 2017 \nThwaites Glacier on the edge of West Antarctica is one of the planet's fastest-moving glaciers. Research shows that it is sliding unstoppably into the ocean, mainly due to warmer seawater lapping at its underside. Major global warming study again questioned, again defended February 7, 2017 \nAnother round of bickering is boiling over about temperature readings used in a 2015 study to show how the planet is warming. 1 comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T00:23:39.102+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
