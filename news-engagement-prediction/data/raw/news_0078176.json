The 44-year-old took to her Instagram page on Monday to share a candid picture of her daughter Apple ahead of a dance competition. The snapshot sees the 12-year-old dressed in an embroidered red dance costume, while her long tresses are swept into a tight bun. Gwyneth simply captioned the photograph with the hashtags, #countdowndancecompetition and #dancemum. \nGwyneth shares Apple and her ten-year-old brother Moses with ex-husband, musician Chris Martin ; the pair \"consciously uncoupled\" in 2014 after ten years of marriage. Despite their divorce, the former couple have remained on good terms and work hard to ensure their children are their top priority. Last year, Gwyneth opened up about the end of her marriage with Chris, admitting she was proud of their relationship as co-parents.

It's a divorce but it's a weird one. It's funny. I don't think about that word very often- divorce. I don't see it that way. I see it more like you meet someone, you have some time together and things just move through.\" Gwyneth has since been in a relationship with Glee co-creator Brad Fulchuk since August 2014, while Chris is believed to be dating Peaky Binders actress Annabelle Wallis .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:50:10.487+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
