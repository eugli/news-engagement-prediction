These falsities are being circulated amongst high officials and the general public only to give an impression that there is some truth in the accusations being made by Justice Karnan, though there is none,” her plea alleged. \nIn her plea, she sought protection from the court against “scurrilous attacks” by Justice Karnan against her husband and harassment of her and her family through his “obscene” telephone calls, among other things. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T04:34:31.418+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
