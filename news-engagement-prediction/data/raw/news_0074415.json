Harrison was asked twice by the media if terrorism was suspected. While he didn’t say “No” he did say it looks like a case of DWI. \n“We suspect that that subject was highly intoxicated,” he said. \nTwenty-one people were hospitalized after the crash with five victims in guarded condition. Seven others declined to be hospitalized, city Emergency Services Director, Dr. Jeff Selder said. \nThe victims range in age from as young as 3 or 4-years-old to adults in their 30s and 40s, said Selder. \nAmong the injured was one New Orleans police officer. Harrison said the officer, who was on duty, was undergoing tests to determine the extent of her injuries. She was in “good spirits,” he said. \nOne woman at the scene told The New Orleans Advocate that a silver truck whisked by her just feet away as she was walking through the intersection. \nCarrie Kinsella said, “I felt a rush it was so fast.” \nTwenty-year-old Kourtney McKinnis told the Advocate that the driver of the truck seemed almost unaware of what he had just done. \n“He was just kind of out of it,” she said. \n(© Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.
