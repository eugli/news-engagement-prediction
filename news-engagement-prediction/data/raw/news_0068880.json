But this one needed a turning point. \nSenior Michelle Pruitt provided one on Tuesday for Homewood-Flossmoor. \nThe 6-foot forward was on the bench as Mother McAuley got a 6-2 jump on the Vikings. After she was summoned by H-F coach Tony Smith, things changed in a big way. \nIt started with six straight steals, three in a row being provided by Pruitt. At the other end, she worked underneath for some early points. \nThe tide was turned as H-F prevailed 59-35 in the Class 4A Shepard Sectional semifinals. \nPruitt finished with 14 points and four rebounds. Missouri recruit Nadia Green added 15 points and Karli Seay contributed 11 points for the Vikings (22-2). \nTara O'Malley led Mother McAuley (22-9) with 14 points. \nIt was almost as if H-F flipped a switch defensively after McAuley's early burst. \n\"Oh, we were struggling a little bit,\" Pruitt said. \"We were trying to recollect ourselves. I was ready to come in the game and help out. \n\"We've been practicing defense a lot ever since we heard we were going to play McAuley. They've got some shooters and drivers, so you've got to be ready.\" \nTo that end, the H-F defense held O'Malley — one of the area's most productive 3-point shooters — scoreless in the first quarter. It was the same for Grace Hynes, whose helter-skelter drives to the basket are a key part of McAuley's offense. \nBut during the 17-0 run by H-F, it wasn't making McAuley miss shots as much as it was stopping the Mighty Macs at midcourt that landed the early knockdown. \n\"We had to take care of the ball and use our bodies to offensively defend a little bit,\" Mighty Macs coach Ashley Clanton said. \"A couple of slipups and you're done just like that. \n\"When they held the ball we had to go out and get them, which isn't what we wanted to do. It was tough fighting back.\" \nO'Malley eventually found her shooting touch, but H-F was long gone. Green highlighted a big third quarter for the Vikings with eight points, and they led by as much as 59-24 before Smith cleared the bench. \n\"I love the playoffs,\" Green said. \"I just want to get downstate really bad and win a state title.\" \nIn the other semifinal, Claire Austin sparked Marist to a 46-35 victory over Marian Catholic. \nMarist trailed 19-16 late in the first half when Austin scored five consecutive points. Later, when Marian knocked a 10-point deficit down to two, she killed the momentum with back-to-back baskets. \nAustin had 20 points and Julia Ruzevich added 12 points for Marist (18-13). Kaylen Evans scored nine points for Marian (18-14). \nTwitter @tbaranek", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T10:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T10:17:59.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
