Well, it's all up in Jon Favreau's Twitter feed. \nThe director announced Friday night that Donald Glover will be playing Simba in the live-action remake of the beloved Disney classic The Lion King alongside the actor who voiced the original Mufasa. \nThe Twitter announcement had Glover ( Atlanta) fans swooning and tossing as many Lion King GIFs at Favreau as possible. James Earl Jones, who voiced Simba's ill-fated father Mufasa in the original cartoon, will be back in the same role. I just can’t wait to be king. #Simba pic.twitter.com/wUYKixMBJI \n— Jon Favreau (@Jon_Favreau) February 18, 2017 Looking forward to working with this legend. #Mufasa pic.twitter.com/1LszbWrcYT \n— Jon Favreau (@Jon_Favreau) February 18, 2017 \nNot much else is known about the movie from Walt Disney Studios. The movie, expected out around 2020 , might be similar in style to Favreau's Jungle Book remake from last year. \nIt seems fitting Favreau referenced the beloved song \"I just can't wait to be king\" to announce Glover's role — the new film will include songs from the 1994 cartoon movie. Fans on Twitter were clamoring for Glover's musical act, Childish Gambino, to remix the iconic tune. \nSo now who's going to play Timon and Pumbaa? Twitter's armchair casting directors have some suggestions: Also, Key & Peele for Timon & Pumba or we riot. #KeyAndPeeleForTimonAndPumbaOrWeRiot \n— Pablo Beal (@PabloBeal) February 18, 2017 If Donald Glover is Simba. Does that mean we get Keith Stanfield and Bryan Tyree Henry as Timon and Pumbaa? pic.twitter.com/16QBjIvoVO \n— Jesse Crap (@jessecarp) February 18, 2017 Simon Pegg and Nick Frost need to be Timon and Pumbaa ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T09:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T04:35:55.641+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
