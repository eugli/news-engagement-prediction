Since giving birth to Dream Renee Kardashian three months ago, Blac Chyna has lost 40 pounds . The mom of two has been keeping fans up to date on her baby weight loss journey, and on Tuesday, she shared her latest milestone on Snapchat. \nChyna shared a video of herself stepping on a scale in her bathroom. \"From 192 to 152.4 - Goal 130 - Summer 2017,\" the caption read. Nice work, mama. A post shared by blacchyna snapchats (@blacchynasnapchats) on Feb 21, 2017 at 5:30pm PST \nChyna has lost six pounds since she last updated fans last month. Without a doubt, she'll reach her goal. Chyna has seemed super motivated to get in peak shape ever since she gave birth to her daughter. ( Some people -- not Chyna of course -- may say she has Kim to thank for the fitness inspiration.) \nMore from CafeMom: 18 Unbelievable Throwback Photos of Rob Kardashian \nAlso, as it's been reported, Chyna and her fianc√© Rob Kardashian have broken up , so there's a good chance she'll take a page out of Khloe Kardashian's book and get a \"revenge body.\" \nChyna has given credit to breastfeeding for helping her lose weight , but it's unclear whether or not she's still doing so. More likely than not, she's shedding the majority of her pounds right now from a healthy diet and exercise. \nLooking good, Chyna. Keep up the good work. And, of course, let us all in on your secrets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T20:30:53.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
