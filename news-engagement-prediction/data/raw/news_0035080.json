Apparently, this will be the fourth film of Dulquer Salmaan to have joined the league. Other films of the actor in the same group are Charlie, Bangalore Days and OK Kanmani.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T12:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T07:53:36.555+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
