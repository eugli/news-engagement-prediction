Click through to get all the details on the biggest music moment of the year, from the set list, to the politcal statement, and to find out whether or not there were surprise celebrity guests! The Set Embed from Getty Images \nGaga promised fans and reporters a “tremendously athletic show,” which is pop music code for “I’ll be hanging on stuff, probably.” \nAnd our suspicions were true — Gaga came in swinging from the roof of the stadium before belting out her first tune (more on that on the next page). \nThe set was expansive, with the pop star and her gaggle of backup dancers performing on a stage lit up from beneath by what looked like lights you'd have at a rave. Also, we can't forget the drones that flew atop the stadium, because hello, this is 2017. The Set List Embed from Getty Images \nStefani had said she wanted to play new music — aka songs from her latest album, Joanne — during the show, but we all know her older hits are the real crowd-pleasers. \nSo, after reciting \"America the Beautiful\" from the top of the stadium, she gave us Little Monsters what we wanted with a six-song set including tracks like \"Poker Face,\" \"Born This Way,\" \"Telephone\" — but no, there was no Beyonce, unfortch — and \"Just Dance,\" in that order. \nThen came a slowed-down version of \"A Million Reasons,\" her most recent single, during which she played the piano and gave a shout out to her parents. \n\"Hey mom! Hey dad!\" she said in between verses. \n\nNext came \"Bad Romance\" — and an outfit change — where Gaga pranced across the stage doing her signature \"Thriller\"-esque moves. The Costumes Embed from Getty Images \nThere were no meat dresses to be seen — obviously Gaga's been there, done that — but the fashion did not dissapoint, as the petite star rocked her signature sky high heels and sparkles galore in two costume changes. \nFirst came a sparkly jumpsuit, which she later topped with a gold metallic vest, and she wrapped by wearing a similar two-piece to show off those hard-earned abs. \nAnd the vocal David Bowie fan also seemed to pay tribute to her idol with her fashion choices, rockin' the 80's hair and Bowie's signature bright eye makeup for the first half of the show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T08:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T04:42:08.152+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
