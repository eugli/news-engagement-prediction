The end result itself was misleading. In their futile chase of 385, which would have been the second highest successful chase if they gave it a shot, they drew out their innings for the full overs in making 296/8.\nThe game was done as a contest long before the halfway mark but Asela Gunaratne's maiden ODI ton of 106 balls displayed a latent fighting spirit missing for the best part of the series.\nAB de Villiers' sealed their second ODI whitewash of the 2016/17 home season, stretching their unbeaten ODI streak at home to 14 matches.\nWhile the upcoming New Zealand series and the ICC Champions Trophy will be the true measure of their aptitude, their excellence in home conditions cannot be doubted.\nHaving surpassed the West Indies' record for the most consecutive wins at home, they are one of the best limited overs teams in the world and unbeatable at home.\nOnly Sachith Pathirana (56) and Gunaratne (114*) provided sustained resistance while Niroshan Dickwella again sparkled with an sparkling 19-ball 39 filled with audacious shots.\\\nKusal Mendis (1), Sandun Weerakody (10), Dhananjaya de Silva (11) provided token resistance but their minds were clearly on the flight home on Saturday afternoon.\nSri Lanka gamely tried to keep up with the tall asking rate but 73/4 after 10 overs, they were two runs ahead of the hosts at the same stage but three wickets in arrears.\nWith Chris Morris (4/31) assiduously working through the middle-order back up by excellent fielding, Sri Lanka didn't stand a chance.\nPowered by contrasting centuries from openers Quinton de Kock (109) and Hashim Amla (154), South Africa propelled themselves to a formidable total of 384/6 after Tharanga gave them first use of a placid batting surface.\nIn the process of making his 12th limited overs hundred, De Kock became the fastest batsmen to reach 3000 ODI runs (74 innings) while also being the youngest batsman to reach a dozen ODI tons.\nWith the ease in which he batted against a jaded Sri Lankan bowling attack, there was an air of inevitability about his knock.\nHe glided to his fifty off only 40 balls while needed a further 40 to notch up one of the more easier centuries he'll ever make.\nHe dominated the opening stand of 187 with his senior partner that came off only 26.3 overs and his 16 boundaries peppered the small ground. Such was the maturity of the innings, not at any stage did he try to hit a six or try to go over the top.\nThe one time he did, he holed out to Weerakody at deep cover off Suranga Lakmal, ending his 87-ball 109.\nIt was left to Amla to steer the ship after compiling his 24th ODI ton off 112 balls. While he matched De Kock shot for shot in his 49-ball half century, Amla was content to chill in De Kock's slipstream while the junior partner relished his role as the calculating belligerent.\nHaving watched his senior middle-order dashers come and go, he shouldered the finishing responsibilities and clobbered some impressive boundaries.\nAll five of his sixes came after the hundred and dominated the 62-run fifth wicket stand between him (35) and Farhaan Behardien (26) made in just 29 balls.\nAmla's third 50 came off just 20 balls with two fours and five sixes. In his last four ODI's at SuperSport Park, he collected 133, 127 and 124 to add to his second highest score and the highest he's made in the country.\n- TMG Digital", "external_links": ["http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://www.reddit.com/static/button/button3.js", "http://twitter.com/share", "http://www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?app_id=162804257120529&href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.timeslive.co.za%2Fsport%2Fcricket%2F2017%2F02%2F10%2FSA-wrap-up-5-0-ODI-white-wash-over-Sri-Lanka&send=false&layout=box_count&width=95&show_faces=true&action=recommend&colorscheme=light&font&height=65", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js"], "published": "2017-02-10T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:01:32.841+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
