And while The New York Times Company recorded significant growth in subscriptions and promising increases in digital advertising, it nevertheless has not avoided the inevitable. The company said on Thursday that its print advertising revenue in 2016 fell 16 percent, driving a 9 percent drop in total advertising revenue.

That has left employees bracing for staff reductions that newsroom leaders said could be announced in the next several weeks. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.
