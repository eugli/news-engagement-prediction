Fire trucks from Lao Khwan and municipalities nearby responded. \nThe fire fighters, farm workers and rescuers from a charity foundation found it difficult to put down the fire because the farm building floor was made with plastic chips. They rushed to open the doors and pen gates so the pigs could escape, but many were trapped by the flames and smoke. \nWhen the fire was finally brought under control two hours later, the charred bodies of more than 2,000 pigs were found in their pens - about 800 female breeding pigs and 1,240 offspring. \nThe farm owner, Chief Warrant Officer Prapai Jitniyom, 54, a soldier of the 6th Engineering Battalion in Ratchaburi, said he was awoken from his sleep by a strong smell of burning materials. The building and pens were already engulfed in flames. \nHe estimated his loss at about 25 million baht. \nThe cause of the fire was being investigated. It was initially believed to be an electrical short circuit.
