And what better way to shine than to coat their nude bodies in rainbow glitter?\n\"It seemed like the most fun and outrageous thing to do within the privacy of our own backyard,\" says Bonnie (aka @busty_diaries ), who organized the activity and acts as a spokesperson for the group. The idea was met with enthusiasm, in part because the women feel extra confident when they're together: \"None of us fit the stereotypical mold of what a model 'should' look like, but together we bring out the best in each other, and we all feel like absolute supermodels,\" Bonnie says.\n And so the women, who each run their own Instagram accounts devoted to lingerie and body positivity, gathered in a backyard to strip down and test the body paint, with Bonnie's husband snapping photos.\n• Sparkle Sparkle • As you know, our gorgeous group of Brisbane babes dressed up for @lingerieofthemonth. But I feel that the after party was even more spectacular than the group pics. How do we party? We strip down & coat each other in glittering goodness! Now, it's one thing to wear each other underwear, but I'm pretty sure this takes friendships to a whole new level! #lingerieofthemonth #allshapesandsizes #lingeriecommunity #mycommunity #dressups #glitter #glittertits #glittering #bodyglitter #happywithcurves #brisbane #backyard #empowered #beautiful #bellevouscomp @bellevousboudoir\nA post shared by Busty Diaries (@busty_diaries) on Nov 30, 2016 at 1:22am PST\nThey painted themselves and each other, and had so much fun with it that they hired a professional photographer (James, aka @nocturne_images ) and planned a glitter-covered trip to the beach for a nude but very sparkly sunrise photo shoot. For privacy — some of the Instagrammers prefer to remain anonymous — they gathered at 2:30 a.m. to trek out to the beach in time for sunrise, despite rainy conditions.\nIs there ever a bad time for glitter butts? I say no! I've been so bad at replying to comments lately, I do apologise. I will be getting back on that!

We are all a touch insane, but that's what makes our time together fun. Who else would think it's a good idea to get up at 2:30am and drive in the pissing rain to get covered in glitter and frolic on the beach? Here I'm with @the_love_of_a and @nipnipss bringing out our weird side. 📸 by @contraryphoto\nA post shared by Rose (@lingerie.rosee) on Jan 22, 2017 at 2:45pm PST\nWhen we were frolicking on the beach, @nipnipss and I got a bit wifey... 📸 by @nocturne_images Censored by me for IG overlords\nA post shared by Rose (@lingerie.rosee) on Jan 20, 2017 at 2:19pm PST\n This past Sunday, a flock of space mermaids descended upon Fingal Beach to create some magic and (of course) I was among them! ✨Space mermaids also known as yours truly > @nipnipss > @lingerie.rosee > @the_love_of_a > @pennysterlingsyd > @blueskieslingerie ✨ thank you so much for welcoming me into the glitter gang you gorgeous specimens!! 📷 by the lovely @nocturne_images\nA post shared by Harmony Sky (@theharmonysky) on Jan 16, 2017 at 5:32am PST\n\"[The group] did it because we love ourselves and want to do things that make us happy,\" Bonnie explains. \"But if these pictures are seen by people and make them feel more confident in themselves, more comfortable in their own skin, and better able to embrace their body shapes, that makes it a total success in my eyes.\"\nAlthough Bonnie isn't featured in the beach photos (she had food poisoning on the day the shoot), she says the project has boosted everyone's self-esteem. It's one reason why they're planning another glitter extravaganza, this time, for a sparkly squad of 10 women.\n• Counting Down The Days • With just under 6 weeks until our next Glitter Extravaganza, I'm proud to say almost everything is organised. Hooray for organisation & hooray for glitter!
