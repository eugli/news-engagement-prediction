Currently playing for the Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Super League, Mills said that he was watching the auction on TV and his phone hadn’t stopped ringing ever since he was picked by Royal Challengers Bangalore. \n“Obviously it was a pretty amazing day, I certainly didn’t quite expect it to go as it did,” Mills was quoted as saying by espncricinfo.com. “I was looking forward to it and got up and watched it on TV in the morning and my phone hasn’t really stopped going since! It’s been pretty special and now I’m just looking forward to getting out there.” \nREAD| Tymal Mills: Quick gun from England set to fire under Virat Kohli in IPL \n“I had a chat with my agent and he’d been speaking to the different owners and coaches so we knew there was some interest,” he says. “But in terms of expectations of how much money I’d go for, I would never have dreamt to go for as much as I have. It was a pretty crazy experience to watch it.” \nMills has a congenital back condition that can cause pain if the workload is not managed. But Mills isn’t trying to think much about it. “My back injury could have been the best thing that’s happened to me in a way because it’s changed all my focus to playing T20 and it’s probably accelerated my development in that form of the game without having to focus on the other two forms,” he said. \nREAD| Kevin Pietersen says why IPL 2017 auction were ‘a slap on Test cricket’s face’ \n“It is sort of a storybook ending, well not ending, but it’s come full circle in the last two years. Probably two years ago I wouldn’t ever have dreamt of being in this position now.” \nMills accepted he will have to be smart while bowling at the Chinnaswamy stadium in Bengaluru which has possibly the smallest boundaries in India. “It went okay playing for England out in India, but you’ve got to be smart, you’ve got to accept that you’re not always going to get it right and that you’re going to go for runs sometimes.” \nREAD| IPL 2017: 22 crorepati players who entered a huge club \n“I think the average score there in T20 is 198 or something, so you’ve got to set your expectations at a reasonable level. You can’t always go for 2/20, 2/18 - sometimes going for 30 is a good day. You’ve got manage expectations, but I’m being brought in to try and change the games for RCB.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T03:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:26:46.039+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
