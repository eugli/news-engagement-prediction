Key points: Roman Quaedvlieg says he needs to \"ensure the security and safety of detainees\" He has discussed policy with Peter Dutton for 12 months Labor asks why such policy is applied to all detainees \nRefugee advocates are currently fighting the ban, and earlier this month the Federal Court granted a temporary injunction against the seizure of phones across mainland centres and on Christmas Island. \nCommissioner Roman Quaedvlieg was questioned about the policy in Senate Estimates, which he signed off on late last year. \n\"I cannot countenance running a custodial setting, which has a facility that allows mobile phones, to be used as an enabler to crime,\" he told the committee. \n\"I just cannot ensure the security and safety of detainees across the population by running centres where I allow mobile phones to be used broadly. \n\"The phones will be used for drug activities and escape plans.\" \nCommissioner Quaedvlieg said he had discussed the policy with Immigration Minister Peter Dutton for the better part of 12 months, and there had been a three-month grace period before the seizure of phones was to begin. \nLabor Senator Louise Pratt asked why such an \"onerous policy\" was being applied to all detainees in the onshore facilities, including those being held there ahead of their deportation from the country. 'It's a balance to be achieved': Commissioner \nCommissioner Quaedvlieg cited examples of criminal behaviour he hoped to stamp out by enforcing the ban, which included halting a drug supply chain being operated from within a facility and preventing detainees from planning their escapes. \n\"It's a balance to be achieved,\" he told the Committee. \n\"Where we are able to provide access to phone infrastructure, ie hard lines that are adequate, then being able to remove smartphones in particular from our custodial setting. \n\"And I can tell you very clearly that it becomes a currency within our centres â€” persons who have phones will be stood over for those phones.\" \nThe Federal Court is due to hear more of the case brought by refugee advocates next month. \nAdvocates argue mobile phones are an essential lifeline for detainees needing to seek legal advice, and help to prevent suffering and mental health crises while behind bars.
