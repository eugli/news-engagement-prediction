FAIRFAX NZ \nFreyberg Beach with the fountain and Oriental Bay in the background. \nIt was designed by capital-based structural engineers Climie Spencer Holmes Millar who were commissioned by the Wellington Harbour Board, who maintained the fountain until Wellington City Council took over in 1989. \nCouncil marina and sports project manager Peter Hemsley said the fountain had some challenging maintenance issues because it runs on salt water. \n\"The pump and motor were specially built to handle the rigours of this and it's not easy to replace the motor and pump hence the scheduled maintenance and testing we undertake on a monthly basis,\" Hemsley said. FAIRFAX NZ \nHugh Carter, the businessman who paid for the building of the fountain, vanished just four days after the water jets were switched on in 1973. \nIn 2008 the pump and motor were replaced at a cost of $29,000 with work carried out in calmer evening conditions from a crane-loaded trawler. Ad Feedback \nIn winter 2011 the fountain was out for weeks when the pump failed and it was sent to Auckland for repairs. \nTo protect the submerged structure from corrosion it runs on a combination of brass and stainless steel and sacrificial anodes attached to the underwater steel tripod system. SUPPLIED/WCC \nThe fountain had its motor and pump replaced in 2008. \nIt clocks up a $20,000 annual electricity bill, which takes total maintenance costs to about $45,000 a year. \nIn 2013 the council installed LED lighting on the fountain to replace the existing halogen lamps. \nCosting about $21,000, the new lights last 25 times longer than the old ones - an average of 50,000 hours compared to the previous 2000 hours. FAIRFAX NZ \nWellington on a good day... \nThe fountain is now be controlled remotely making it much easier to change colour - with 16 colour variations it generally runs on a colour scroll type sequence. \nInteractive control of the lights means events including the fireworks display, St Patrick's Day and Christmas can be synchronised. \nIts control panel is inside the onshore Band Rotunda building and linked to the fountain by cables running along the seabed. FAIRFAX NZ \n...and on a bad day. \nBefore the LED lights went in, changing colours was a lot more laborious - a contractor would have to access the fountain by boat and put a coloured gel panel over the light boxes. These would last about a month before degrading. \nDuring the week the fountain is active in up to three hour bursts four times a day, with extended hours on the weekend, and shoots seawater up to 16 metres into the air. A sensor shuts it down if the wind is at 10 knots or stronger. \nHemsley said swimmers occasionally try and get on the fountain but the mounting manoeuvre is so difficult fountain breaches were \"not really an issue.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:32:18.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
