Frey and Bowie were in fact featured in last year's \"In Memoriam\" segment, and Grimmie was featured in a longer list of names on the Grammys website . The Emmys last year saw similar backlash when the awards show left Grimmie out of its \"In Memoriam\" segment, an oversight that an Emmys spokesperson attributed to being \"constrained by time and space.\" \nGrimmie, a contestant on season six of The Voice who amassed a wide following on YouTube and went on to record two EPs, died in June 2016. She won a Teen Choice Award in 2016 and opened for Selena Gomez on tours in 2011 and 2013. \nWhile signing autographs for fans after a performance, Grimmie was shot by a fan. Her brother tackled the gunman, Grimmie was taken to the hospital where she died that night . Her online following has remained loyal to her and her work in the months since her passing.
