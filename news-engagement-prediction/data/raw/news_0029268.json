Bye Paris. @SputnikInt pic.twitter.com/xUoAO1vLR3 \n— LH ✘ #March4Trump (@Lucid4Trump) February 14, 2017 \nPolice were hit with molotov cocktails and the heavy metal balls used in the French game Petanque. \nAnd after setting cars and even a disability vehicle on fire the police have been forced to fire live rounds of bullets. \nA reporter for the French TV company BMTV was also injured after being attacked. \nThe areas of Aulnay-Sous-Bois, Aulnay, Argenteuil, Bobigny and Tremblay-en-France in the Saint-Seine-Denis district have all been affected. The area of Paris currently crippled by riots is around 33% Muslim. I'm sure this is just a coincidence, though. https://t.co/eygWQleTN9 \n— Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) February 14, 2017 \nIt follows allegations of horrific police brutality in a housing estate called Rose des Vents in Aulnay-Sous-Bois which is also known locally as the ‘city of 3000’. \nLocal residents and police forces have called the continued unrest “disgraceful” while the man allegedly assaulted by police named only as Theo has pleaded for calm. \nYves Lefebvre head of the police union said: “Setting a wheelchair van on fire is a disgrace. This has to stop.” \nThe French Government’s response to the latest outbreaks of violence is to put 2,600 cameras on police officers to record them out on the job. \nLast night it was claimed rioters shouted ‘Allahu Akbar’ during violent protests in Paris where a car was set on fire. \nFront National (FN) MP Marion Le Pen tweeted the amateur video which shows chaotic scenes including of clouds of smoke after cars were set on fire and a man yelling “Allahu Akbar”, Arabic for God is Greatest, three times.
