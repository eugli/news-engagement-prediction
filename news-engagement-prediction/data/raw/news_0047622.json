Police said both were Maoists and that a rifle along with other weapons was recovered from the encounter site. \nVillagers have accused the police of sexually assaulting Hemla before killing her and sought an independent inquiry as well as a second autopsy on her body. They also claimed that eyes of the two had been gouged out. \n“More than 700 tribals of the village protested in front of the police station. The tribals are demanding that the post-mortem is done again because the eyes of the woman are missing. They are also demanding that a case is registered against the guilty personnel,” Soni Sori, tribal activist and Aam Aadmi Party leader who led the protest, said. \nShe said the family members of the dead tribals alleged that the police abducted them on January 27 when they were returning from the weekly Kirandul market and killed them saying they were Maoists. \nSori and five others activists who visited the village, about 30 km from Kirandul market in Dantewada, on February 12, also demanded an independent inquiry into the matter. \n“It was a fake encounter and a high-level inquiry should be conducted. The villagers are protesting with the bodies but no one (from the government or administration) has visited the village. The bodies are still lying in the village and have not been buried,” said Sori. \nDantewada DIG P Sunderraj, however, rubbished the claims of sexual assault and torture. \n“The allegations are completely baseless as security forces never do such things. I have got the information about the protest and we will inquire into the matter,” Sunderraj said. \nthe special director general of police (anti-Maoist operations), DM Awasthi, told Hindustan Times he has sought a detailed report of the case. \n“No criminal activity of security forces will be tolerated in Bastar. I have asked DIG, Dantewada, to conduct an inquiry and submit a report immediately,” Awasthi said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-18T00:43:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-18T20:44:51.884+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
