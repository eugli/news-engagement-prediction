Keith Ellison, “the one who predicted early that I would win!” \nEllison (D-Minn.) is considered a top contender to be the next DNC chairman, along with former Secretary of Labor Tom Perez. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, is also a candidate for the job and on Wednesday morning was endorsed by former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean. Story Continued Below \n“One thing I will say about Rep. Keith Ellison, in his fight to lead the DNC, is that he was the one who predicted early that I would win!” Trump wrote on Twitter Wednesday morning. \nAppearing on ABC’s “This Week” in July of 2015, Ellison prophetically warned Democrats to take Trump seriously at a time when very few did. \n“Anybody from the Democratic side of the fence who’s terrified of the possibility of President Trump better vote, better get active, better get involved, because this man has got some momentum and we better be ready for the fact that he might be leading the Republican ticket,” Ellison said, prompting laughter from the “This Week” panel. \n“I know you don’t believe that,” host George Stephanopoulos told Ellison, to which the Minnesota congressman replied that he had watched former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura win his state’s governorship and that “stranger things have happened.” \nThe election for DNC chair will be held during the Democratic National Committee’s winter meeting, scheduled to begin Thursday in Atlanta.
