Budget 2017: So how much income tax will you save? Source : Print \nBudget 2017 saw the Finance Minister announcing a cut in income tax rates from the current 10% to 5% in the Rs 2.5 lakh-Rs 5 lakh income band. \nThis translates to a maximum Rs 12500 cut in income tax . But how much of a benefit will it offer tax payers in different pay bands. \nFirst, a look at the new income-tax slabs: \nLet us pull out relevant portions from Jaitley own speech to explain how this would ease the tax burden: \n\"... there would be zero tax liability for people getting income up to Rs 3 lakhs per annum and the tax liability will only be Rs 2500 for people with income between Rs 3 and Rs 3.5 lakhs . \nIf the limit of Rs 1.5 lakh under Section 80C for investment is used fully the tax would be zero for people with income of Rs 4.5 lakhs . \n\"While the taxation liability of people with income up to Rs 5 lakhs is being reduced to half , all the other categories of tax payers in the subsequent slabs will also get a uniform benefit of Rs 12500/- per person . \" \nThere is an important rider . Those with annual taxable incomes between Rs 50 lakh and up to Rs 1 crore will now have to pay a newly announced surcharge of 10% to offset this loss of revenue. So, they will have to pay extra there. \nThe 15% surcharge on incomes above Rs 1 crore stays.
