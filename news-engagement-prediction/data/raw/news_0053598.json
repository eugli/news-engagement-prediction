(Photo: Pool photo by Anthony Behar) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nI have spent my professional career working in the delivery of care as a practicing physician and as a member of Congress. In both of these roles, I have witnessed the great challenges in delivering care to patients relying on federal programs such as Medicaid. I have also experienced the administrative hurdles involved in delivering care to Medicaid beneficiaries. \nMedicaid is a critical safety net program that is responsible for covering more Americans than any other insurer in the country. Furthermore, Medicaid is tasked with providing services to millions of vulnerable Americans who rely on significant access to high-quality health care. The program ranges from state to state, and the needs of beneficiaries and providers are diverse and complex. \nThe Administration has pledged to work closely with Congress to rebuild our collapsing health care system and return the patient back to the center of the system. Critical to this reform will be the strengthening and sustaining of Medicaid for the most vulnerable. In step with his commitment to fix our broken health care system, President Trump nominated a proven leader of health reform, Seema Verma , as administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). \nSeema Verma has first-hand knowledge of health policy solutions because she has helped accomplish meaningful reforms. I became acquainted with Verma’s expertise in health policy when she testified before the Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Health back in 2013. Verma has championed reforms to improve the quality of care for the nation’s most vulnerable populations by returning conservative and free-market principles to Medicaid reform. \nPerhaps most notably, Verma has dedicated years to modernizing Indiana’s Medicaid program, now known as the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0 (HIP 2.0), to ensure it best serves the Hoosiers who need it most. HIP 2.0 successfully applies conservative approaches to Medicaid that leverage free markets to the advantage of beneficiaries. U.S. health care needs a wakeup call from India: Column \nAs the most consumer-driven Medicaid program in the country, HIP 2.0 empowers individuals to take responsibility for their health. Beneficiaries contribute up to 2% of their monthly income to a health savings account, which they can utilize to cover health care costs and make their own health care decisions. By making these contributions, they can access their health benefits and those who consistently make monthly contributions qualify for vision and dental coverage. 90% of those in the program are below the poverty level and more than 92% make contributions consistently. \nEmpowering consumers, not the government, ensures patients are in the driver’s seat and are better engaged in their own health care decisions. Unlike the results of the ACA, the plan that Verma helped design has resulted in the right kind of health care utilization. Under HIP 2.0, emergency room use decreased by 42% from individuals moving from Medicaid to HIP. In contrast, states like Oregon that expanded Medicaid, without the innovative approaches allowed in Indiana, saw an increase of 13% in ER visits . On Obamacare, Congress doesn't know best: Column \nTo her critics, I would say Verma’s record speaks for itself. In its first year, HIP 2.0 has not only set individuals on a path to good health and independence, but has received overwhelming member satisfaction. More than 80% of members have said they would pay more to be part of the program. Verma has made it her business to help states better ensure that the most vulnerable Americans have access to the care they need. \nShe has helped modernize Medicaid programs to be more consumer-directed and patient-focused. Her experience will be essential as she addresses health care reform this year. She has a proven track record of championing reforms for Americans that work, and has demonstrated strong knowledge of many facets of health care policy. I am confident Verma, as CMS Administrator, will work closely with Congress to deliver on our promise to repair the broken elements our health care system. The time for health care reform is now, and we need people like Seema Verma in the administration. \nRep. Michael C. Burgess, R-Texas, is the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health and the most senior medical doctor in the House of Representatives. \nYou can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page , on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter .
