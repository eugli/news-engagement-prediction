Volunteers helped save hundreds \nThe surviving whales were last seen swimming six kilometres off-shore on Sunday evening, according to DOC. \nLast Thursday a pod of about 400 whales became stranded, with a second pod of more than 200 whales stranded on Saturday. \nThe precise cause of the whale stranding was not known. \nBeached whales are not uncommon on Golden Bay. \nIts shallow muddy waters confuse the whale's sonar, leaving it vulnerable to stranding by an ebb tide, according to marine environmental organisation Project Jonah. \nPilot whales are not listed as endangered, but little is known about their population in New Zealand waters. \nReuters/AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T09:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T04:18:15.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
