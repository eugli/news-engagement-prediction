And this is a historic rose garden because it’s on the National Register of Historic places.” \nBut the rose garden has had no roses since 2015. \nMites blew in carrying a disease called Rose Rosette devastating every rose bush on the garden. \n“It alters the growth habits and form of the rose,” said Huddleston. “It results in a phenomena called witch’s broom at the end of the branches, shortened twisted they’re all close together like a broom. There’s obvious red growth, red leaves in the foliage and you’ll also see excessive thorniness.” \nThere is no treating the bush. More than 1,500 rose bushes had to be ripped from the ground and destroyed. \n“So, things were not coming up roses,” said Huddleston. “Well, they were coming up roses. They ALL had to come up!” \nNorth Texas became the epicenter of Rose Rosette Disease nationally as landscapers clamored to plant new, hardy types of roses. \n“Everybody got on the bandwagon and planted them,” explained Huddleston. “At entrances to neighborhoods, and commercial landscapes, home landscape. They were all over town. So, the mites had a field day!” \nAfter waiting months to make sure no roots survived, the botanic garden finally has rose bushes again and has taken the time to remodel the classic garden adding new trees and spacing the rose bushes further apart to prevent mites from crawling from one bush to another in case of another infection. \nBut the mites can still be blown from one place to another by the wind. \nSo, they’re telling the public to keep an eye on their roses, or the rose garden may suffer again. \n“Because if we get rid of the rose bushes we get rid of the mites,” said Huddleston. “And if people hang on to their diseased rosebushes, those mites will blow right back into the rose garden or infect somebody else’s roses.” \n(©2017 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.   rewritten, or redistributed.)
