Mmm very nice\" Revealed BY SAM WEBB 4th February 2017, 1:38 am A FATHER who is wanted for the murder of his two daughters in 2008 filmed the teenagers in bed and creepily complimented their legs in horrifying new footage. \nYaser Abdel Said disappeared after Amina, 18, and Sarah, 17, were shot 11 times in a taxi on New Year’s Day. Facebook/The Price Of Honour It is believed Said gunned down his two daughters Amina, 18, and Sarah, 17, and then fled Facebook/The Price Of Honour Said was described as a controlling and abusive father Crime watch daily He filmed the girls as they lay in bed Crime watch daily 5 The girls appear uncomfortable with being filmed \nSaid, of Irving, Texas, filmed the just-awake girls and is heard to say: “Nice legs. Mmm very nice” as he pans over their legs.“Sarah sleeps with her pants? Mmm, very nice. Wow, look at those eyes. I got my eye on you,” he adds. \nDallas News reported that the girls accused their father of sexual abuse in 1998, when they were 9 and 8 years old. Their mother, Patricia Owens, swore to cops that the allegations were true, but the girls told authorities that they lied because they did not want to move to a school in rural Texas.
