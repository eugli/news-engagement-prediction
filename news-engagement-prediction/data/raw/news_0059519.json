The more tasty Black Kampua Noodles (bottom) pairs quite well with the Village Chicken (top) while the peanut-flavoured White Kampua Noodles (middle left) complements the homemade Char Siew (middle right). \nTing says kampua noodles are typically handmade, and due to its starchy nature, the noodles absorb sauces easily and must be eaten quickly before it gets too soggy. \nAt Mian, kampua mee , which translates as “dry plate noodles” in the Hock Chew dialect, is served in two forms: black and white. \nThe black kampua mee is closer to the original Sitiawan recipe. It is made with soy sauce, pork and lard, and served with fried onion garnish, crunchy bean sprouts and clear wantan soup. \nThe savoury taste of soy sauce pairs very well with the plainer village chicken. Ting recommends adding a little of their homemade pickled garlic and vinegar sauce to give a slightly sharp tinge to the flavour. \nThe white kampua mee is made with a homemade peanut oil sauce, instead of soy sauce. If you have peanut allergies, then stay clear. \nMildly flavoured, it has minced pork in place of bean sprouts, and is best paired with Mian’s sweet homemade char siew (barbecued pork). Mian, a restaurant that specialises in Sitiawan-style Hock Chew Kampua Noodles, opened in Sunwaymas Commercial Centre, Petaling Jaya about five months ago. \nExplaining why their char siew is black in colour instead of red, Ting says this is because the meat does not contain red food colouring. Moreover, they use more caramelised black sauce to get a better taste. \nWhile kampua mee is the highlight at Mian, there are a few other noodle dishes worth trying too, including the prawn mee hoon . \nThe dish comes with rather generous helpings of ingredients – two prawns, a whole hard-boiled egg, siew yuk (roasted pork), bean sprouts and other vegetables. But what really sets it apart is the broth. \nMade from a combination of prawn stock and pork broth, it is concentrated and gives the dish a very rich prawn flavour. \nAnother item on the menu is the clear soup lou shu fan . \nThe recipe for this comfort food comes from Chua’s grandmother. Coffee lovers may be delighted to know that Mian serves Vietnamese Drip Coffee for just RM5. \nThe soup is boiled with preserved vegetables and served with lou shu fan (“rat tail noodles” in Chinese), delicious pork balls, dumplings, beancurd skin ( foo zhuk ) and minced pork. \nThe two types of kampua noodles at Mian are served with clear wantan soup and priced at RM6.90 and RM7.50, depending on portion. \nOrdering the dish with char siew or village chicken adds RM1 to the price tag. \nBoth the Prawn Mee Hoon and Clear Soup Lou Shu Fan are priced at RM7.90 (regular) and RM8.50 (large). \nMeat items such as village chicken (RM15 for a quarter chicken), char siew (RM5) and siew yuk (RM6) can also be ordered à la carte as side dishes. \nMIAN, No 9-1, Jalan PJU 1/3C, Sunwaymas Commercial Centre, Petaling Jaya.
