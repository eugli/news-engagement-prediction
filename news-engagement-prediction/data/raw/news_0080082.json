Image copyright British Museum Image caption The metal detectorists found the gold torcs buried close to each other just under the surface \n\"The torcs were probably worn by wealthy and powerful women, perhaps people from the Continent who had married into the local community. \n\"Piecing together how these objects came to be carefully buried in a Staffordshire field will give us an invaluable insight into life in Iron Age Britain.\" \nThe four torcs were found separately, about 1m apart, buried near the surface in Leekfrith last December. \nMr Hambleton said: \"I used to go metal detecting with my dad when I was young and he said to me 'why are you bothering fishing? You should be back in those fields'. \n\"I am so glad we took his advice and pleased of course that he got the chance to see these amazing pieces and prove he was right all along.\" \nThe jewellery has been handed to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, which is part of Birmingham Museums. \nAn inquest will decide whether the pieces are treasure and they will then be provisionally valued. \nThe friends said they would share any proceeds with the family living where the finds were made.
