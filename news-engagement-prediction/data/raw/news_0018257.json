Featuring a montage of in-the-studio footage from Isbell's recent recording session, the clip also includes a half-minute snippet of guitar feedback, orchestral strings and Zeppelin-worthy riffage, presumably lifted from a new song. \nRounding out the video are appearances by producer Dave Cobb and all five members of the 400 Unit – guitarist Sadler Vaden, fiddle player Amanda Shires, keyboardist Derry DeBorja, bassist Jimbo Hart and drummer Chad Gamble – as well as some gorgeous black-and-white shots of Cobb's new digs in RCA Studio A. The takeaway? Isbell has rounded up his Grammy-winning team, cranked the guitar amps by a few degrees and made another album in Nashville, following the release of 2015's mellow Something More Than Free with something that may well be big and bombastic. \nStill a road warrior, Isbell hits the highway this March, following a trip to Mexico for the Avett Brothers' At the Beach Festival this weekend with a handful of headlining dates that stretch into May.
