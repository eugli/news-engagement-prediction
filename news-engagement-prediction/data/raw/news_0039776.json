Bruce Rauner made a pitch for a permanent property tax freeze and urged legislators to follow through on a budget compromise some have dubbed the \"grand bargain.\" | File photo by The State Journal-Register, distributed by the Associated Press @TinaSfon | Sign-Up for our News & Politics Newsletter Sign-Up \nSPRINGFIELD — Trying to forge a way forward without “pointing fingers,” Gov. Bruce Rauner in his third budget address urged legislators Wednesday to help move along the Illinois Senate “grand bargain” plan — while pushing for a permanent property tax freeze, a workers’ compensation system that mirrors Massachusetts and a cap on spending. \n“This isn’t about pointing fingers or assigning blame,” the governor said, as some Democrats laughed. “We are where we are. It’s not about the past; it’s about how we move forward together.” \nNevertheless, there were some partisan games ahead of the address. Just before the speech, House Republicans urged Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan to remove four signs that were taped onto podiums on the Democratic side. They read “Rauner budget = fake news” and “Rauner budget = alternative facts.” \nMadigan’s response? “I think they’re within the right if they want to put a sign up or anything else.” \nIn his address, Rauner urged the implementation of the school funding reform commission and an increase in the general state aid to benefit all state schools. He also proposed fully funding regular transportation costs for schools around the state. \nThe governor also proposed increased funding for English learners and early childhood education — and a 10 percent increase to MAP grant funding. \nRauner used a portion of his budget address to encourage the Illinois General Assembly to pass the only budget in town — the Senate “grand bargain” package. \n“Now is the time to seize the moment – build on the progress made in recent weeks – and right our ship of state,” Rauner said. “Together, we can make Illinois more competitive and more compassionate. We can make the necessary changes to fix our broken system.” \nRauner has been mum publicly about the plan. Wednesday marks the first time he ventured into what he supports within the package of bills — which culminated after talks between Rauner and Madigan broke down in December. \nThe governor asked for a permanent property tax freeze in Illinois, saying a temporary freeze alongside an income tax hike is “just not fair to hard-working taxpayers across the state.” The Senate plan has a temporary freeze attached. \nAmong the most unpopular portions of the package is a hike of the income tax rate to 4.99 percent — which is viewed as politically unpopular in many circles. \n“Over time, as our economy grows and revenues expand, any increase in the income tax could be stepped down — dedicating future surpluses to taxpayers, not more government spending,” Rauner said. \nRauner spoke of his support of broadening the sales tax base to mirror Wisconsin’s — but said he won’t support a tax on groceries and medicine, or a tax on retirement incomes. He also spoke of his support for raising the earned-income tax credit and the research-and-development tax credit. \nSenators had discussed the idea of removing the state sales tax exemption from food and drugs, but that change never made it into an amendment of the plan’s revenue bill. \nOf the Senate plan, Rauner said an agreement — on both sides — “is now a question of political will.” \n“I firmly believe that we can come to agreement on these issues,” Rauner said. “And I pledge to you that I will sign that good deal for taxpayers the minute it arrives at my desk.” \nThere was a brief pause in the address about 34 minutes in, as Rauner’s teleprompter broke down. Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan handed the governor her paper copy as he waited for his speech to return. \n“Speaker said it was the Russians,” Rauner said to laughter. \nAfter the speech, the state’s budget director, Scott Harry, told reporters the state needs about $4.6 billion in revenue to ultimately balance the governor’s proposed budget. Harry said the governor needs structural changes and reduced spending in order to agree to new revenues. \nWithin the state’s budget plan is a $3 billion reduction in spending, including $1.3 billion in pension cuts and $520 million for group health insurance for state employees. The plan also includes $340 million in projected savings for procurement reform; $240 million in projected savings from selling the James R. Thompson Center; and $120 million in savings for a new community reinvestment program. \nThe chief architects of the ‘Grand Bargain’ offered differing reactions to the governor’s speech. \nSenate President John J. Cullerton issued a terse statement, not even mentioning Rauner or his address. \n“Right now the Senate is working on this year’s budget because there isn’t one,” the North Side Democrat said. “We need to restore stability and sanity to Illinois’ finances. That begins with a budget for the here and now. That’s what the Senate is trying to do.” \nBut Senate Republican Leader Christine Radogno applauded Rauner. \n“I am heartened by the Governor’s speech today –and his very public demonstration once again of his willingness to work with Republicans and Democrats to bring Illinois out of this crisis,” the Lemont Republican said in a statement. \n“I share his sense of urgency – the time is now. Illinois goes $11 million further into debt each and every day we continue to spend without a budget in place. Today the Governor also acknowledged the great deal of groundwork that has gone into negotiating a package that can pass in a Democrat-controlled Senate and encouraged us to keep working. We can now consider the Governor’s advice in our discussions as we move forward. \n“We want what the Governor wants – a bipartisan compromise that is a good deal for the taxpayers.” \nRauner’s chief Democratic nemesis, Speaker Mike Madigan, issued a statement blasting the governor for failing to introduce a balanced budget “for the third straight year.” \n“As the governor told a newspaper recently, his plan is to ‘stay the course,'” the Southwest Side Democrat said. “That means continuing to use the disabled, the elderly, school children, victims of abuse, and many others as negotiating tools in his effort to increase profits of big corporations at the expense of middle class and struggling families. ‘Staying the course’, as the Governor wishes, means billions of dollars in new debt, and lost services for tens of thousands of Illinois’ most vulnerable children, seniors and families. \n“Unlike the governor’s ‘stay the course’ plan, Democrats are proposing a new way forward. We want to work cooperatively with the governor to pass a full-year balanced budget and improve our economy, but we don’t accept that the only way to create jobs is by cutting wages and stripping away protections for workers in an effort to increase profits for businesses – all at the expense of middle-class families. We will pass reforms that lift up the middle class and provide good jobs for working families while also helping businesses grow and expanding our economy.” \nAmid the budget impasse, Rauner had already borne the brunt of criticism ahead of his budget address — with Democratic legislators and elected officials urging him to present a balanced budget. \nA stopgap measure expired on Jan. 1 — leaving social service agencies and universities high and dry, while the state’s bill backlog creeps to $11.3 billion.
