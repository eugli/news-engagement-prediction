Diatomic Elements This is iodine, an example of a diatomic element. The halogens are elements that form diatomic molecules. Dorling Kindersley, Getty Images Updated August 14, 2016 . Question: What Are the Seven Diatomic Elements? \nThere are seven elements that form diatomic molecules . This is a list of the seven diatomic elements. (Note that only five of these elements form diatomic molecule at room temperature.) \nAnswer: The seven diatomic elements are: \nHydrogen (H 2 )Iodine (I 2 )Bromine (Br 2 ) \nAll of these elements are nonmetals, since the halogens are a special type of nonmetallic element. Bromine is a liquid at room temperature, while the other elements all gases under ordinary conditions. As the temperature is lowered or pressure is increased, the other elements become diatomic liquids. How To Remember the Diatomic Elements \nThe elements ending with \"-gen\" including halogens form diatomic molecules. An easy-to-remember mnemonic for the diatomic elements is: H ave N o F ear O f I ce C old B eer", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T17:41:10.797+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
