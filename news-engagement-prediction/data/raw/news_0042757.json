MUST READ DMK will bring no-confidence motion against Tamil Nadu Assembly Speaker: MK Stalin \nSeparately, Tamil Nadu Governor Vidyasagar Rao has sought a detailed report on the happenings in the state Assembly on the day of trust vote on Saturday. \nThe development comes in the backdrop of the ruckus in the House before the voting on the confidence motion moved by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy in which opposition DMK MLAs were evicted en masse and the Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League members staged a walk out. \nEarlier, a team of DMK leaders led by Rajya Sabha member Trichy Siva met Governor at Raj Bhavan and submitted a memorandum seeking to nullify the trust vote saying it was held in contravention of House rules. \nFormer chief minister and leader of the rival faction in the AIADMK O Panneerselvam also met the Governor and sought rejection of the trust vote. \nIn the confidence motion held on Saturday, the Edappadi Palaniswamy cabinet won by 122 votes in favour and 11 against. \nPalaniswamy is considered a loyalist of VK Sasikala, a former aide of J Jayalalithaa. Sasikala is now serving a four year jail term in the Bengaluru prison after her conviction in a disproportionate assets case.
