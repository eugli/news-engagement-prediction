Money is tight and the club do not receive much in the way of funding. The first team almost folded in the summer, which would have meant the Under 18s would not have been allowed to compete in the Youth Cup. Thoughts about how their journey could have been ended prematurely were not on many minds as they piled onto the coach ahead of the two-hour drive. Instead players pointed out every McDonald's en route - a restaurant they have been discouraged from visiting by manager Roy Bleau. Stepping off the team bus following a two-hour trip via a hotel stay, the team arrive at Villa The Hertfordshire club are reminded that the senior team of their much more illustrious opponents were once European champions as they make their way to the changing rooms The Broxbourne players take in their surroundings as they sit inside the away changing room Optimism was in the air for Broxbourne having already seen off bigger teams in the Youth Cup BROXBOURNE'S FA YOUTH CUP RUN TO R5 September 22: Ilford 2-1 (first round qualifying) October 5: 3-2 Concord Rangers (AET) (second round qualifying) October 19: 3-0 Aveley (third round qualifying) Given bye for first round November 16: 2-1 Boreham Wood (second round) December 7: Chester 1-0 (AET) (third round) January 11: Yeovil Town 1-0 (fourth round) Bold denotes played at home Bleau was joined by coach Jamie Crouch and assistant coach-cum-organisational guru Andy Collins. All three are among the good men of football, those who give up time, energy and money for no reward beyond the happiness they bring. Their unheralded tales are shared at the game's grassroots clubs up and down the country. Collins spent the week organising the bus and purchasing kit so the players would look and feel the part. Crouch got an initial insight into Villa's kids by scouting them on Football Manager. And as they travelled, they discussed their hopes. Optimism was in the air. Bleau answered a call from his mum and seemed touched that she had called him from abroad on what must have been one of the biggest weekends of his life. Sportsmail's Amitai Winehouse was behind the scenes with the team for the fifth round clash Defender George Quarrington-Carter speaks to Sportsmail after the Cup clash Most of all, they tried not to transmit their nerves to the team. Team selection was still on their minds and would remain so until breakfast on the morning of the match. They considered injuries, the mentality required and how to break the news to those who would not be included in the 16. At least eight players, in the words of the coaching staff, had travelled without any real belief they would play. Maybe that is why the atmosphere at the team hotel later was so without concern. Laughter went up from one table as defender Issa Farouk - a fan of Chinese takeaways - dealt with the chicken pate he had accidentally ordered. Bleau and the team watched one of Villa's previous games in full, analysing, looking for opportunities that could be exploited. A defender was nicknamed 'clumsy', errors were noted. They wanted to get everything right. Around 400 Broxbourne fans made the trip to the West Midlands to support their side Despite the heavy defeat, Broxbourne fans cheered their teenage heroes throughout The morning after, it would have been easy for them to crumble as soon as they saw the imposing structure ahead of them. Instead, captain James Kelly, the obvious joker in the pack, shouted up that this was Villa's cup final. Tension relieved. In the belly of the stadium, physio Magenta Ross - who had to find cover for her usual team to make the trip - and director of football Graham Dodd prepared as Bleau and Crouch put the players through their paces. Fans of Broxbourne began to arrive. Eventually there were around 400 supporters gathered to cheer on a group of teenagers who had become heroes. The Broxbourne Borough team walk out onto the pitch before the start of the match The team take instructions ahead of their highly anticipated FA Youth cup clash They soon disappeared down the tunnel, where the dressing room atmosphere was not what most would have expected. There were no pre-match jitters from the players. The team was calm. Whatever happened, they were enjoying themselves. I followed as they emerged to the sight of the Holte End with the sun emerging behind it and the roar of their travelling supporters. It was a moment that sent shivers down the spine. The game began. For half an hour, Broxbourne kept Villa at bay. The host's coaches encouraged rapid switches of play from the touchline. The chasing Broxbourne players tired and the breakthrough came. A former professional in the press box expected it to be one-way traffic, but ahead of Villa's second, Broxbourne had a chance to score through Alie Bangura. It would be a shock if this is the last time you read that name. As a teammate pointed out after the tie, 'he could have been playing for Aston Villa'. Broxbourne star player Alie Bangura attempts to take on the Aston Villa defence Aston Villa's overall class eventually told as they ran out 7-0 winners at Villa Park The goals flowed. It could have made for a disheartening day for Broxbourne, but the minute the final whistle blew their fans gave them such an ovation it was impossible to be down. Midfielder Garvey Tulloch-Jordan explained: 'Even though we lost, we still won in a sense that the fans were still there supporting us, our managers were still giving us support. 'The Aston Villa boys shook our hands and wished us good luck. That's what football is about.' Manager Roy Bleau (right) sits alongside assistant boss Jamie Crouch as he addresses his side Despite the defeat Broxbourne players were still able to bow out of the Cup heads held high Bleau, a Black Cab driver, salutes supporters after the match as his side exited the competition After the return, our time ended with Bleau hopping into his black cab and dropping me off at the local station. The way he shook my hand through the tiny gap in the divider could not have been more in contrast to the pre-match exchanges with his full-time opposite number but was no less genuine. Broxbourne made history on Saturday. A team of their level is unlikely to make the fifth round of the Youth Cup again any time soon. It may have been a brief moment in the sun for most, but from manager to coaches to players to those who waited for the team to return to Goffs Lane on Saturday evening, they do not do what they do for fame. Instead, it is all out of a pure love for football. It's easy to forget, but stories like this remind you why the game is worth falling head over heels for in the first place. The Under 18s are looking for sponsorship going forward as they move up to Under 21 or first-team level next season.
