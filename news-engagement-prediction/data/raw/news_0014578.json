They are aware her first pregnancy was high-risk and even required bed rest, but we're told they have no alternative plans ... it's full steam ahead. \nWe're told producers have not reached out to other singers in case Beyonce won't show. They believe they will know soon, and it's better for her to make the first move than for them to jump the gun. \nIt's unclear how far along Beyonce is in her pregnancy , but we may get a good idea at Sunday's Grammys, where she's expected to perform.
