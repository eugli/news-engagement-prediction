Advertisement More by this Author \nDeputy Governor Samuel Wamathai will be sworn in on Monday as Nyeri’s new county boss, heightening anxiety on the composition of a new Cabinet. \nMr Wamathai will take the oath of office at the county headquarters in a ceremony presided over by Resident Judge Jarius Ngaah. \nAt least five governors from the Mount Kenya region are expected at the function, among them Council of Governors chairman Peter Munya of Meru. \nThe seat fell vacant following the death of Nderitu Gachagua in a London hospital on Friday. \nBut a law sending the ministers home has caused jitters among the late governor’s appointees as they wait for his successor to effect changes. \nGachagua’s brother Rigathi Gachagua said the family will fully support the new county boss, noting that its political machinery was at his disposal.

If all goes well and the paper work is successful, the body will arrive in the country on Thursday at 5am, he said. \nMr Rigathi revealed that when his brother’s health deteriorated while in hospital, the family had begun plans to fly him back to the country. \n“We want to bring him but doctors at the airline were of the view that he was a little bit weak and felt that he might not make it,” said Mr Rigathi. “We were in the process of getting a private jet but that never came to be.” \nThe family said they had received support from Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed and Kenya’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom Lazarus Ombai Amayo in efforts to bring the body home. \nSeveral governors will accompany the body from London. \nThe burial date is also yet to be set, pending consultations between the family and the Office of the President, but prayers will commence at All Saints Cathedral in Nairobi on Tuesday. \nBeing the first governor to die in office, it was not clear if Gachagua will be accorded a state burial, the family said. \nMeanwhile, Mr Rigathi extended an olive branch to Gachagua’s critics, saying: “We have nothing against those who fought him and we forgive them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T05:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:21:16.938+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
