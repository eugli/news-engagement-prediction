Barca, finalists in five of the last six years, have never been able to get their wish.\nIn geographical terms, Athletic Club's San Mames ground, in Bilbao, would have been ideally situated for the upcoming final but a concert that week means it is an unlikely venue. \nRead more Madrid have 'operation underway' to sign United's De Gea Griezmann is 'happy at Atletico' despite United interest Barcelona thrash Athletic as Lionel Messi breaks yet another record There may be a get-out this year in a repeat final at the Calderón, principally because it is scheduled to be the final game at Atleti's old stadium and will no doubt be seen as a fitting send-off for a fine old ground.\nSo while we expect that to be the resolution, and it will provide a stadium of decent capacity in a neutral city for the two finalists, we're unlikely to see the conclusion of the matter until all sides have acted out their petty agendas via proxy. \nAnd then we'll only have another year to wait for a repeat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T18:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T13:56:19.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
