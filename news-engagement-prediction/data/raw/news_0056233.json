By Zee Media Bureau | Last Updated: Tuesday, February 21, 2017 - 11:07 0 Follow @ZeeNews \nNew Delhi: Knee pain has the tendency to become a nuisance if not taken proper care of or given appropriate treatment. \nThose suffering from chronic knee pain are familiar with the everyday struggles they have to face. However, there are some chronic knee pain patients who prefer online interventions as compared to accessing specialist clinicians to prescribe and supervise treatments. \nA study has, in fact, confirmed that such online interventions, combining home exercise and pain-coping skills training, provided substantial clinical benefits for patients suffering from chronic knee pain. \nThis model of care delivery could greatly improve patient access to effective treatments. \nResults of a randomized, controlled trial are published in Annals of Internal Medicine. \nKnee osteoarthritis, the leading cause of chronic knee pain, causes loss of function, reduced quality of life, and psychological disability. \nThere is no cure for osteoarthritis and given the aging population and increasing obesity, disease burden is rapidly increasing. \nHome-based exercise and pain-coping skills training, an approach based on cognitive behavioral principles to target psychological factors that are common in persons with chronic pain, have been shown to offer relief. \nResearchers tested an Internet-delivered treatment program to determine if it could improve pain and function in patients with chronic knee pain. Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. \nThe intervention group had seven Skype sessions with a physical therapist to learn home exercises and pain-coping skills over three months. \nThe control group received educational materials online. The researchers measured pain and physical functioning in both groups at baseline, three months, and nine months. \nParticipants in the intervention group reported significantly more improvement in pain and physical function than those in the control group. \nThe author of an accompanying editorial suggests that these findings are encouraging and show that \"telemedicine\" can break down barriers to care, making treatment inexpensive and easily scalable. \n(With ANI inputs) First Published: Tuesday, February 21, 2017 - 11:07 More from zeenews ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:58:11.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
