The 'Explorer 1' satellite launched in 1958. The JPL now acts as the headquarters for exploratory missions to study distant planets and asteroids. But conspiracy theorists suggest that the labs house secret alien technology captured from fallen UFOs. The JPL is the birthplace of America's first satellite to orbit the Earth back in 1958. It now acts as the headquarters for several upcoming exploratory missions to study distant planets and asteroids And this is not the first time that UFO Hunters have used Google's satellite tech to spot aliens. Earlier this month a self-proclaimed ufologist claimed footage of himself fighting and being abducted by aliens had been caught on camera by Google maps. A man who called himself John Mooner, from Newton Abbot in Devon, claimed a 'real alien abduction' has been captured taking place on Google's satellite cameras. The green glow is supposedly light from an alien ship hoping to beam him up. The small red circles allegedly show him being punched in the face by an alien. A zoomed in version is shown top right THE 'ABDUCTION' Mr Mooner claimed he does not remember the abduction at all, but is convinced it is himself in the footage. 'I do remember sporadic episodes of missing time throughout the year of 2016 and going back through the previous years,' he said. He is convinced from looking at a series of pictures that he was abducted. 'The shocking thing about this was that it's me being abducted by a grey alien and the satellite image clearly shows me trying to fight off the grey alien by punching it in the face,' he said. 'I was having trouble with the Google Earth app that was installed on my computer so I looked for an online option and found Google satellite maps,' Mr Mooner told the Torquay Herald Express . 'I thought to myself I will view the area where I was UFO spotted from last year and look for anything out of the ordinary. 'I was left speechless by what I saw. 'The satellite has captured a real alien abduction taking place.' The pictures were released by Mr Mooner, who claims he took them from Google maps. Where exactly the abduction took place is unknown. 'The shocking thing about this was that it's me being abducted by a grey alien and the satellite image clearly shows me trying to fight off the grey alien by punching it in the face,' he said. Mr Mooner claims he does not remember the abduction at all, but is convinced it is himself in the footage. 'I do however remember sporadic episodes of missing time throughout the year of 2016 and going back through the previous years,' he said 'Looking at the image it appears that the alien has blocked my punch and has grabbed my fist and must of been able to subdue me [sic].' Mr Mooner claims he does not remember the abduction at all, but is convinced it is himself in the footage. 'I do however remember sporadic episodes of missing time throughout the year of 2016 and going back through the previous years,' he said. 'I do remember wearing a black baseball cap and shirt. This is definitely me on the satellite image.'
