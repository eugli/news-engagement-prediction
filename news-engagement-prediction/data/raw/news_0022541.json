Feb. 10, 2017, 3:51 p.m. California expands its legal attack on federal immigration policy in new amicus brief Patrick McGreevy Xavier Becerra at his first confirmation hearing for state attorney general on Jan. 10. (Rich Pedroncelli / AP) \nCalifornia expanded its legal attack on federal immigration policy Friday, for the first time challenging practices not part of President Trump's travel ban. \nCalifornia Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra joined an amicus brief Friday supporting a lawsuit pending in the U.S. Supreme Court that challenges the authority of federal immigration officials to detain non-citizens without providing them a hearing on their removal from the U.S. \nTwo previous friend-of-the-court filings supported lawsuits challenging President Trump’s travel ban order. The new case, joined by seven states, does not involve that order. \nIn the latest case, Jennings v. Rodriguez, the plaintiffs are non-citizens who were detained by federal authorities for longer than six months. The lawsuit argues that the Constitution mandates that they receive a hearing on whether their detention is justified. \nThe class action is filed on behalf of plaintiffs including a Mexican immigrant, who was detained for removal because of a drug conviction even though he is a lawful permanent resident. Another plaintiff is an asylum seeker from Ethiopia who was detained for removal because of insufficient proof of identity. \nThe plaintiffs in the case want to be released on bond if the government cannot show they are a danger to the public or a flight risk, Becerra said. \n“No one should be detained for months without being assessed first for his or her actual flight risk or dangerousness,” Becerra said in a statement. “Mothers and fathers are detained who cannot return home to their children; others are simply missing work. Their absences could have long-term impact on families, communities, states and the country.” \nThe states joining California in filing the amicus brief are Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.
