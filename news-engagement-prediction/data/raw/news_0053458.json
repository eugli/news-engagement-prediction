Image caption Sophie Howe said the M4 relief road was not the most sustainable option \nUnder a law passed two years ago, Ms Howe has a legal duty to advise Welsh ministers on whether policies or government projects offer the best deal for future generations. \nIn her submission to the public inquiry, she said: \"I believe that using the Welsh Government's borrowing powers to finance one scheme that will, at best, result in geographically, economically and socially disproportionate benefits to one part of Wales is ill-conceived.\" \nShe added: \"Building roads is what we have been doing for the last 50 years and is not the solution we should be seeking in 2017 and beyond. \n\"The rationale for a new road was conceived over 25 years ago with the main purpose of addressing congestion in the area. \n\"I do not agree with the basic premise that this is the 'most sustainable, long-term solution to current social, environmental and economic problems associated with this route'.\" \nThe legal duty to consider the impact on future generations - unique to Wales - means the Welsh Government should \"explore other ways to address the problem\", she added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T13:56:49.733+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
