Ray Donovan BEIJING — The scam may be as old as the automobile itself: A fraudster throws himself in front of a vehicle and demands that the driver pay for his self-inflicted (or nonexistent) injuries. But in an age of ever-present cameras, it’s getting a lot harder to pull off. There are scores of videos online that capture these scams, known in China as “pengci,” or “porcelain bumping.” The video above, posted last month, shows a woman in Yongzhou, in the central province of Hunan, taking the scam to brash extremes. After getting money from the driver of a car she had lain in front of, she boasts to bystanders and even does a little jig in front of the car. Here’s an excerpt from the exchange between the woman and the driver: Driver: “What do you want? Get up! Go away!

The woman retrieves it to laughter from the crowd and breaks into a dance.) The woman then says to the person filming, “Photograph me! It’s only 20 renminbi, but I can make 250 in an hour!’’ She is later seen on the ground in front of another car.

Eventually she is dragged away by the police.

There is no reliable information on the scale of the fraud, and it is usually not prosecuted. For many victims, paying a bit of cash is preferable to arguing with the perpetrator or having to navigate China’s challenging legal system. \n  But on Saturday, a court in Shenyang, in the northeastern province of Liaoning, sentenced two men to 11 months in prison and fined them about $3,000 each for targeting small trucks while driving a three-wheeled motorized vehicle typically used by disabled people.
