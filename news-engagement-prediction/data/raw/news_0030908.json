The announcement has been running on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat. It made some noise, it shows how much people can’t stand this situation any more.” GETTY Protesters have torched a car during the violence It shows how much people can’t stand this situation any more Rally organiser \nThe unrest follows several nights of violence in Paris and it has revived previous controversies over the relationship between the police and immigrant communities in France’s poor suburbs, where there is often accusations of police discrimination and brutality. \nAfter a search, Theo was handcuffed and taken to a police car where officers insulted him, spat on him and gave him beatings.
