Mr Christensen did not send the letter but provided details of its content to the media. SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Nationals MP George Christensen wrote a letter to Malcolm Turnbull demanding he take action on the sugar industry. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen \nIn it he said his support for the government was contingent on Mr Turnbull announcing a mandatory code of conduct for the sugar industry by March 1, with penalties. \nMr Christensen's repeated public doubts about being a member of the Coalition and threats to cross the floor have raised questions about his role as Chief Nationals Whip, a position that puts him in charge of enforcing party discipline. \nQueensland Liberal National Party MP Keith Pitt said sugar was an \"extremely hot button\" in Mr Christensen's electorate and that he was right to demand action for his constituents. \n\"If you don't stand up for the people you represent you won't be representing them much longer,\" he said. Advertisement \nFrontbench Nationals MP Michael McCormack said Mr Christensen was \"generally a team player\". \n\"His job is to represent his electorate first and foremost,\" he said. \nNSW Nationals senator John Williams said he had not picked up the sense in the party that Mr Christensen should be stripped of his whip role. \nLiberal National senator Barry O'Sullivan said he did not believe Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce should put Mr Christensen in a \"straitjacket\". \n\"I think more politicians ought to get off their fat bony arses around the country and speak up about what's right for their people,\" he told the ABC. \nMr Joyce travelled to far north Queensland on the weekend to meet cane farmers to discuss their ongoing dispute with international agribusiness Wilmar Sugar. \nOn Sunday he visited Ayr, a town in Mr Christensen's electorate with the local MP and state opposition leader Tim Nicholls. \nMr Christensen previously threatened to pull support for the government over the backpacker tax and to cross the floor to vote against the government's superannuation changes.
