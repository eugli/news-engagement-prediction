Hell, my best mate is a (black/Asian/mixed etc.) dude and his family all love me’. The woman who created 'on fleek' has launched a GoFundMe to start her own beauty line \nPlenty of people have told me in the past how they’re not a fan of mixed race marriages (something about white women stealing black men, yadda yadda) and would never want a biracial kid. And they’ve also always clarified that they’re not being racist because they love me . \nNEWS FLASH my friends: you are still a bit racist. \nWhich is why people were confused when CoverGirl tried to use this line of argument when defending their first ever male model, James Charles. \nThe 17-year-old recently found himself in a whole load of sh*t when he tweeted a bizarre ‘joke’ about Africa having ECbola. I will no longer support your company as long as he's on the campaign. This was stereotypical & degrading to Africa. @COVERGIRL @COVERGIRL pic.twitter.com/RpgMp1lqfg \n— IG/SC: ParisHeelton (@ImTheBombDotCom) February 16, 2017 \nThis, despite the fact that the World Health Organisation officially declaring that Africa was clear of Ebola as of January 2016. \nAnd rather than simply coming out and admitting that it was a dumb thing to say, CoverGirl didn’t make Charles apologise for the comment. \nInstead, they posted a photo of him hugging Zendaya – which they’ve since deleted. a play in four acts pic.twitter.com/eSCplXDN6W \nBecause there’s no way he could be an ignorant t**t if he could hug a biracial model, right? \nThe point wasn’t lost on Twitter. when covergirl really tried to tweet zendaya and james charles together after his messy statement pic.twitter.com/bVHt2LJZyi ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T18:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T15:01:31.994+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
