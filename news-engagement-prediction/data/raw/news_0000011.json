He’s like a brother to me, and I’ll be sad to see him go. Since he’s a Londoner, I’m worried he’ll move back across the pond. I’m secretly hoping he books another job locally, in Los Angeles, so that he sticks around.” \nOn his character: “I like how flawed Connor is. I think that we’re in a really exciting time for television. We’re continuing to see more nuanced and complicated characters on screen, which is a more accurate representation of real life.” \nOn the rest of the season: “Our fans are in for quite a ride during the remainder of our third season. Wes’ death raises a lot of questions and the rest of the season sets out to explore, and hopefully answer, some of those questions.” \nFor more on Jack , visit Daman.co.id .
