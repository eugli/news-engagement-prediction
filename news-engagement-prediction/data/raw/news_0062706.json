Also, eight defaulting realtors have not done any work on the site for last few years.(HT File) \nHomebuyers have joined hands with farmers to protest against the Greater Noida authority for allegedly sheltering realtors who are failing to clear land dues and deliver flats on time. \n“We will protest against the Greater Noida authority outside its new office in Knowledge Park-4 after March 11 with the support of farmers. We are forced to protest because the authority is yet to list details of defaulting builders on its website for buyers’ use. Also, the authority is not taking strict action against the builders on time. As a result, they are cheating new buyers,” Abhishek Kumar, the president of Noida extension flat owners’ welfare association (NEFOWA), said. \nFarmers said that they will protest against the authority because their issues related to abadi land and land compensation, acquired for realty projects, are yet to be resolved. \nHomebuyers recently met Union home minister Rajnath Singh, Congress leader Ajay Maken and also protested outside the Prime Minister’s office in Delhi, demanding action against builders for not delivering projects on time. \nMany realty projects in Greater Noida have been delayed up to around six years. Also, eight defaulting realtors have not done any work on the site for last few years. \n“These builders were supposed to begin construction within one year of buying the land. Had the authority acted against the builder, many buyers would not have invested their hard-earned money to buy flats in these projects. Also, had there been transparency in making realtors details public online, many buyers could have taken an informed decision,” Varun Mahajan, a buyer, said. \nOne Greater Noida builder who was arrested by Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) at Indira Gandhi Airport for fraud and cheating, three days ago, continued to sell flats despite being a defaulter of the Greater Noida authority. \n“Why did the authority allot group housing land to inexperienced persons who did not have the expertise in realty sector and construction? Had the authority played its role properly, buyers would not have been cheated,” Kumar said. \nOn September 6, 2016, the authority had listed defaulters’ names on its website. But under pressure from the builders, the Greater Noida authority, after a week, removed the list. \n“Many builders paid their dues, so they were not defaulters anymore. We removed the list from the website because it was harming the financial credibility of each realtor who wanted to raise funds to finish a project. We want realtors to pay their dues and deliver flats to buyers. But at the same time, we are also acting against those who are not in a position to revive a project. If a buyer wants details about any builder, they can visit our office and contact me for the same,” Deepak Agarwal, the chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority, said. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T06:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T03:26:39.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
