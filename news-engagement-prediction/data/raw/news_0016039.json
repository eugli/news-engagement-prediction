He said he works as a social worker for a county sheriff.\n“Nobody wants to stop the best and brightest from coming to our schools,” he said. “They’re not the issue. It’s keeping us safe from people who are not being vetted, who are coming from places where terrorism has occurred.”\nArege Pascucci of Middleton, who attended the inauguration, said she is frequently taken into a room and asked questions when she goes to visit a property she owns in the Bahamas. She believes that just as she is vetted when visiting another country, America has a responsibility to its citizens to vet visitors.\nAdvertisement\n“I understand the country’s policies and I’m not offended by it whatsoever,” she said. “... I follow the rules that are expected of me.”\nSteve Boyson of Dennis, who works in construction, views Trump as a successful businessman who is following through on his promises — big promises, and therefore big actions.\nAs an old wise man once told me, ‘We’ll be talking about this man for the next 20,000 years for what he did today,’ ” he said.\nThe actions that sparked protests across the country are seen by Trump supporters as evidence that the president says what he means and does what he says.\n“President Trump is doing exactly what he campaigned on,” said Janet Fogarty, a state committee woman for the Massachusetts Republican Party and a delegate for Trump. “It’s what people voted for. It’s why he won the election.”\nFogarty said she wishes more attention were being paid to the “temporary” aspect of the order, and doesn’t understand the widespread outrage. Contrary to Trump being seen as anti-immigration, she sees him as pro-immigration — he just wants the right immigrants who have been sufficiently investigated, she said.\n“He always said he would impose extreme vetting of people coming into the country, especially people from countries that have been hostile to us,” said Fogarty. “... He doesn’t just talk.”\nNicole Fleming can be reached at nicole.fleming@globe.com .", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F04%2Ftrump-supporters-voice-their-approval%2FJxbhE9ZDyFhr19ykKHVofN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&title=Trump", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Trump", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F04%2Ftrump-supporters-voice-their-approval%2FJxbhE9ZDyFhr19ykKHVofN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25&t=Trump", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F04%2Ftrump-supporters-voice-their-approval%2FJxbhE9ZDyFhr19ykKHVofN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%26s_campaign%3dsm_gp%26hl=en-US", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bostonglobe.com%2Fmetro%2F2017%2F02%2F04%2Ftrump-supporters-voice-their-approval%2FJxbhE9ZDyFhr19ykKHVofN%2Fstory.html%3Fevent%3Devent25%3Fevent%3Devent25&tTrump"], "published": "2017-02-04T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T12:07:54.461+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
