Rohrabacher responded to the incident by saying the activists were involved in \"political thuggery.\" \nLocal activist groups Oak View ComUNIDAD, The Beautiful Resistance and the Arab American Civic Council also helped to organize Monday's rally. \nRashad Al-Dabbagh, founder of the Arab American Civic Council, said he hoped the rally would signal to Rohrabacher that minority groups want their voices heard. \n\"He needs to understand that he doesn't just represent those that voted for him,\" he said. \nDemonstrators Monday met at Triangle Park, at 521 Main St., and then marched down the street to the pier. \nPeople carried American flags and signs reading \"Immigrants Make America Great\" and \"Bridges not Walls,\" both references to Trump's promise to beef up border security with the building of a wall. \nA few people held milk cartons bearing a picture of Rohrabacher and reading \"Missing.\" \nPeople chanted \"Together united, we'll never be defeated\" and \"This is what democracy looks like.\" \nToward the end of the rally, a group of participants lined up on the sand in such a way that they spelled out \"resist,\" a reference to an emerging national movement pledging resistance to Trump's policies. \nWayne Self, 47, of Aliso Viejo said he was marching because of his concern over what he believes are Trump's and Rohrabacher's ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nHelen Molles, 74, of Seal Beach said she's worried about Rohrabacher's views on the Affordable Care Act, which Trump has promised to repeal and replace. \n\"I have family that have been saved by the [ACA],\" she said. \nRose Molina, 57, of Huntington Beach said she just wanted to raise awareness of Trump's and Rohrabacher's \"hateful rhetoric.\" \nMolina said she has written to Rohrabacher on several occasions regarding concerns she has with the treatment of minorities nationwide. \n\"Rohrabacher is supposed to represent his constituents and he isn't,\" she said. \nAbout 20 people showed up to counter-protest. \n\"There's another point of view in this community,\" said Ron Higby, 79, of Huntington Beach, who added that he also wanted to monitor the event after a protest at University of California, Berkeley turned violent a few weeks ago. \n\"There's a difference between peaceful protest and anarchy,\" Higby said. \nThe two groups became embroiled in a few verbal confrontations, including the trading of obscenity-laced jabs, but Monday's march was nonviolent. \nIndivisible OC members said they will continue visiting Rohrabacher's office at 1 p.m. Tuesdays. \nRohrabacher represents California's 48th District, which includes Seal Beach, Corona del Mar, Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach, Laguna Beach, Fountain Valley and several other cities.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T09:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T07:03:41.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
