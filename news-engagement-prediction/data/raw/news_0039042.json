Goehrke tweeted to which the Sports Illustrated cover star wrote, \"sure.\" @geniebouchard if patriots win we go on a date? \nL uckily for Goehrke, the Patriots completed a miraculous comeback with Tom Brady dragging the team from a 21-3 half time deficit to win their fifth Super Bowl in 10 years in a dramatic over-time finish.

There was no chance,\" said Bouchard. \nâ€œI was worried, however, when I looked at his Twitter profile as soon as I lost the bet and his profile picture was a picture of Tiger Woods. I was like, â€˜Itâ€™s one of those Twitter fans. I donâ€™t even know what he looks like. What is going to happen?' \n\"But it turns out he seems to be a very nice boy.\" \nThe 22-year-old went out in the third round of the Australian Open last month, losing in straight sets to America's CoCo Vandeweghe. \nFollow the latest Telegraph Tennis news READ MORE ABOUT:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T15:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T12:12:03.856+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
