By John Hayes /   \nMaintenance planned today on a Norfolk Southern Railroad line in Hays will include a controlled explosion on the steep hillside where the troubled bald eagles have rebuilt their nest. \nIn an email message, Rachel Handel, communications director of the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania, said the birds are unlikely to be disturbed by the blast and subsequent removal of rocks and debris. \n\"We have talked with Norfolk Southern and determined that this work should not have any impact on the bald eagles, as it is about a half mile to 1 mile away from the nest site,\" she said \"Weâ€™re watching the situation.\" \nSince Feb. 12, when a windstorm toppled the tree that held their nest, the eagle pair have hastily constructed a new nest more than 100 yards west of the previous site and beyond camera range of the live-feed video system that has permitted views inside the nest since 2014. Based on the Hays eagles' behavior, it is believed the female has laid at least one egg. \nJohn Hayes: 412-263-1991, jhayes@post-gazette.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T00:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T19:20:56.748+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
