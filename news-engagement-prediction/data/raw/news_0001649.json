That puts a man with no foreign policy experience advising a president with no foreign policy experience — potentially without the help of the officials with arguably the most foreign policy experience.\nTrump also reportedly berated Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on a scheduled call and hung up on him half an hour early.\nA quick fact-check Day 10 – Jan. 29: In a tweet that built upon the religious prioritization of his executive order, Trump claimed that Christians are being executed in the Middle East in “large numbers.” NPR pointed out that Muslims die at the hands of ISIS in far larger numbers, however.\nA deadly operation Day 11 – Jan. 30: Although Trump called it “successful,” his first counterrorism raid didn’t go exactly as planned. The operation, which targeted al-Qaida in Yemen, killed an American soldier and 10 women and children, including the 8-year-old daughter of notorious propagandist Anwar al-Alwaki, an American citizen killed by a 2011 drone strike in Yemen.\nTrump also fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates after she publicly declared the Department of Justice wouldn’t enforce the president’s controversial immigration ban while under her control.\nNominating the next Scalia Day 12 – Jan. 31: Trump announced conservative federal judge and originalist Neil Gorsuch as his nominee for the vacant seat on the Supreme Court. Here’s what he could mean for legal weed, abortion, and LGBTQ rights.\n****\nVICE NEWS’ COVERAGE: How lawyers inside JFK airport helped families affected by Trump’s refugee ban\nBorder protection agents are still trying to deport people at LAX, attorneys say\nNew DOJ immigration memo targets asylum seekers and vulnerable kids, attorneys say\nTrump’s Supreme Court nominee probably won’t decide cases this term\nLiberals, prepare yourselves: The economy could start out really strong under Trump\nDemocrats face a tough choice: Resist Trump or face the rage of “The Resistance”\nA Somali refugee planned to reunite with her 4-year-old son. Then came Trump’s ban.\n****\nWhat do Frederick Douglass and fake news have in common? Day 13 – Feb. 1: Trump kicked off Black History Month with some vague comments about famous black Americans — and fake news, of course. “Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who’s done an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I noticed,” Trump said before calling CNN fake news … again.\nWill pray for ratings Day 14 – Feb. 2: Trump tweeted a threat to pull federal funding from the University of California-Berkeley, the flagship of one of the country’s largest education systems, after it cancelled an appearance by alt-right troll Milo Yiannopoulos over imminent public safety concerns.\nA few hours later, the president continued his ongoing feud with Arnold Schwarzenegger by asking 3,000 religious leaders at the annual National Prayer Breakfast to pray for the German action star to start earning better ratings in his new role as host of “Celebrity Apprentice.”\nTrump puts Iran “on notice” Day 15 – Feb. 3: A day after Trump tweeted that Iran had been put “on notice” for conducting a ballistic missile test Sunday, his administration announced a new wave of sanctions toward people and companies in the country — the same sanctions that Obama initiated.\nThis week in POTUS tweets: Somebody with aptitude and conviction should buy the FAKE NEWS and failing @nytimes and either run it correctly or let it fold with dignity!\n— Donald J.
