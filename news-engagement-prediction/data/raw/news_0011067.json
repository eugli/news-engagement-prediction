At its peak the fire had crews of up to 25 firefighters and 10 helicopters battling and dampening down hot spots. \nThe blaze burned on public conservation land near the railway bridge over Broken River. No houses were located nearby. GERARD FRIEL/SUPPLIED \nThe fire, as seen from a plane en route to Brisbane, Australia on Saturday morning. \nThe closure meant rail links between Christchurch and the West Coast and top of the south were cut off after KiwiRail's Christchurch to Picton link suffered major damage during November's Kaikoura earthquake. \nREAD MORE: \nThe Christchurch to Greymouth line remained closed on Monday as KiwiRail staff assessed the damage caused by the fire between Cass and Springfield. SUPPLIED \nThe blaze as seen from across the valley. \nKiwiRail network services general manager Todd Moyle said a complete assessment would take some time and depended on how safe it was for staff to access the fire-damaged area. \n\"However, early indications are that there has been extensive damage to one bridge as well as damage to other bridges and viaducts in the area,\" he said. \n\"Any repair work that is needed will be complicated by the difficulty of gaining access to the sites where the damage has occurred, and that will add to the time needed to reopen the line.\" JOHN KIRK-ANDERSON/FAIRFAX NZ Ad Feedback \nThe closure affects the TranzAlpine passenger service and freight services carrying coal and dairy products from the West Coast. \nDepartment of Conservation North Canterbury operations manager Kingsley Timpson​ said the cause of the fire would likely be known within a week. BRONWYN MCCLINTOCK/SUPPLIED \nSmoke seen from above at the south end of Lees Valley. \nFires had previously been caused both by people and railway sparks, so it was too soon to speculate what the cause was, he said. \nAfter an overnight \"flare-up\" on Sunday, caused by warm and windy conditions, Monday's crews focused on containing problem areas. \n\"We don't do firefighting in the dark up there. We had to get a lot of resources on there first thing [Monday] morning and that seems to have been successful.\" STEPHEN RUSSELL/SUPPLIED \nThe Broken River Viaduct on the Christchurch to Greymouth railway line in 2012. \nHe said he hoped forecasted rainfall for the South Island's east coast on Monday night would help keep the fire under control, but crews would likely be there for at least a few more days. \n\"It keeps flaring up around the edges. Really difficult terrain makes it difficult for firefighters to get into and, with high winds, helicopters also struggle. \n\"We're having to spend a little more time on it than we would like, but overall we're making good progress.\" \nTimpson said the loss off many sub-alpine plants and species would take \"a long time\" to repopulate. \n\"There's always a risk of weed invasion back into areas once they've been burnt. \n\"It would be a loss of eco-system if weed took over the area and it would be expensive to try and get it re-established, so we need to watch that carefully.\" - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T11:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T07:10:41.653+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
