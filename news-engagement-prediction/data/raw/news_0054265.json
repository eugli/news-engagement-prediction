Alamy 1 Preston Crown Court heard a stepdad used his stepson as a ‘human dartboard’ by hanging him on the back of a door and throwing darts at his head \nThe prosecution allege he forced the children – who also cannot be named to protect their identity – to beat each other with steel-toed boots and stilettos. \nA jury was told that he hit them with his belt, beat them if they took food without permission, punched one boy if he misspelt words and hit him over the head if chores were not done correctly. \nHe put out cigarettes on one child, and found it “amusing” when he forced the sisters to beat their brother, it is alleged. related stories CRAZY PAVING Homeowner who spent £2,000 paving over own front lawn is ordered to rip it up or face court by property developer he bought the house from sun says The court ruling on foreign spouses in the UK was sensible and free from EU judges' influence CLIMBDOWN TALKS Ministers in secret plot to give MPs a VETO on the PM's final blueprint for Brexit 'she ruined my life' Cruel fraudster who stole TV psychic Sally Morgan's ID walks free from court COURT IN THE ACT Man jailed after streaming court case live on Facebook from his mobile \nIn one incident, one alleged victim told the police that one child was hung on the back of the living room door where the dartboard was, before the defendant threw darts at his head. \nProsecutor Richard Haworth described the alleged incidents as “gratuitous beating, punching and hitting”. \nThe prosecutor told Preston Crown Court that one alleged victim says the abuse started when he was around four-years-old. \nHe said: “The defendant would hit them with his belt after they had warmed their bottoms against the fire, so it would hurt more. \n“He would make him kneel down on the floor and get his two sisters to hit him with his steel toed boots. \n“He would get them to pull his hair. \n“The child described how they were kept short of food.” \nOne child is said to have been told to beat the youngest complainant but was unable to bring himself to do it because she was cowering in a corner. \nSo as retribution the defendant is alleged to have punched him in the head with such force that his head “bounced off the wall”. \nThe jury was told the child was said to have suffered numerous injuries during the period of the abuse. \nAfter going to hospital for treatment on one occasion, he was forced to run and hide from police when they said they would take him back home, jurors were told. \nThe court was told the child didn’t tell anybody about the abuse, which lasted until he was around 14, because he “thought it was the norm”. \nBut he told police that the defendant “robbed him of his childhood” and called him a “bully”. \nThe court heard that the child’s mother also used to beat him. \nAnother alleged victim said the violence started for her when she was around six-years-old and only stopped when she went into voluntary care aged 12. \nThe court heard she was forced to hit another child with the boot and sweeping brush, and slap another on the back – things the defendant is alleged to have found “amusing”. \nProsecutor Mr Haworth said: “He would assault them by punching. He resorted to putting her head under the tap.” \nThe court heard how the defendant would punch one girl all over the body and put out cigarettes and cigars on her, causing scaring. \nThe defendant denies three counts of child cruelty. \nA second defendant denies one count of child cruelty between 1976 and 1986. \nThe trial continues. \nWe pay for your stories!
