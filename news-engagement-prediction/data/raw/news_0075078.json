But will Mick discover her plan – and will he try and stop her? \nMick is giving up hope over the future of the Queen Vic and yet more bad news pushes him to hit the bottle. Despairing at the prospect of losing the business and also of ending up behind bars if he can’t pay the fine, it’s fair to say that Mick is at rock bottom and Shirley hates seeing him like this. \nLater, Mick gets an unexpected offer which could keep him out of jail but he stuns his family when he refuses, prompting Shirley to come up with a shocking plan. (Picture: BBC) \nAs Johnny puts pressure on his dad to come clean to Linda about how much trouble they’re in, Shirley sets the ball rolling on her idea. \nBut just what has Shirley got up her sleeve – and will Mick be able to talk her out of it? \nOne to watch: Friday 10th March at 8pm on BBC One.
