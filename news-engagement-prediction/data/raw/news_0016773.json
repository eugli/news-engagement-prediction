Key points: Profit rises 42pc to $88m Toll revenue tops $1b for six months to December 31 Transurban said it will consider bid for $17b Sydney WestConnex project \nAustralia's biggest toll road operator upped its full-year guidance, after a jump in revenues pushed first-half profit up 42 per cent to $88 million. \nMost of the revenue gains were from toll increases, with traffic volumes not growing at the same pace as revenues. \nBrisbane saw the biggest increase in Transurban's proportional toll revenue, up 32 per cent on a 19 per cent increase in traffic volumes. \nSydney's revenue was up 9 per cent on just a 3 per cent increase in traffic, while road-widening work in Melbourne saw vehicle numbers slip around 1 per cent, although the firm still managed a modest 3 per growth in revenues. \nThe expansion of express lanes in Transurban's US Washington network also delivered a strong 21 per cent growth in takings. \nThe solid increase boosted the company's free-cash flow by almost 50 per cent to $680 million and led to an increased guidance on shareholder distributions. Transurban seeks expansion, including WestConnex \nTransurban chief executive Scott Charlton upgraded the full-year 2017 distribution to 51.5 cents per security, a 13 per cent increase on last year and well in excess of market expectations. \nMr Charlton said Transurban was poised for a period of strong growth, with $9 billion worth of development projects in the pipeline all running on-time and on-budget, with only the planned $5.5 billion Western Distributor in Melbourne likely to require additional capital above current balance sheet reserves. \nMr Charlton also expressed interest in bidding for the $17 billion WestConnex toll road in Sydney, once the New South Wales Government releases more details on the project, as well further opportunities in the US. \n\"The whole talk is positive, but it takes time and, like Australia, infrastructure is provided by the states,\" Mr Charlton said about reports the Trump administration is planning a major boost to infrastructure spending, particularly on roads and bridges. \nWhile motorists lost out, investors welcomed the outlook and the prospect of an increased payout, driving up shares by 4 per cent to $10.78 at 11:00am (AEDT).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T07:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T06:41:21.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
