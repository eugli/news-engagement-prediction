Scoundrel. Hero. A new Star Wars story begins,\" promises the tagline for the spinoff, which will chronicle a young Han's (Alden Ehrenreich) early adventures with Chewbacca. The first ensemble cast photo shows Ehrenreich alongside Woody Harrelson, Emilia Clarke, Donald Glover and Phoebe Waller-Bridge—plus Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca. The Lego Movie duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are directing. Thandie Newton, not pictured, will also appear in the film.\n Set well before the events of Star Wars: A New Hope , the movie will feature Han and Chewie's early encounters with \"that other card-playing rogue from a galaxy far, far away, Lando Calrissian,\" who will be played by Glover. Harrelson will play an early mentor to Han, while details of Clarke and Newton's roles have been kept under wraps, and Fleabag's Waller-Bridge will reportedly give a \"CGI-driven performance.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.starwars.com/news/han-solo-smuggler-scoundrel-hero-new-star-wars-story-begins"], "published": "2017-02-22T03:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:12:56.249+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
