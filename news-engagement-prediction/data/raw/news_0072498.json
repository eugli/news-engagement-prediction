Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nYou may not have heard of the Olimpico di Serravalle - but on Wednesday night, it plays host to the biggest international match of 2017. \nOK, maybe not the biggest… and definitely not the best. \nBut, regardless of what actually happens on the pitch, San Marino vs Andorra is going to be AMAZING. San Marino: a side with a not terribly glorious past (Photo: Alexander Hassenstein) Andorra: ditto (Photo: Octavio Passos) \nIn terms of the standard of play, the friendly between the two infamous European minnows is unlikely to hit the heights of the more glamorous side of international football. \nBut for a whole host of reasons, when San Marino host Andorra, it is going to make for the most wonderfully bizarre game of international football you can possibly imagine. Here's why… 1. It's a match that defies logic \nSan Marino are 202nd in the official FIFA rankings. Andorra are 203rd. There are 196 countries in the world. \nYes, there are more international teams in the world than actual nations. Don't ask… 2. It's not quite the two worst teams in the world competing to see who can call themselves the second-worst team in the world… but it's close \nThe only teams below San Marino and Andorra in the rankings are British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, Bahamas, Djibouti, Eritrea, Gibraltar, Somalia and Tonga. 3. Andorra could end their record-breaking winless streak \nAndorra have gone a remarkable 86 games without a win, the longest such run in international football. 4. However, San Marino could be about to end their own astonishing barren run \nThe San Marinos Marinians Maritian Marinoish guys from San Marino have themselves gone 74 games without a victory. In fact, they have only won ONE of the 139 matches they have played since their international debut in 1990 (a friendly against Liechtenstein in 2004). 5. One of these two teams MIGHT ACTUALLY WIN A GAME of football for the first in YEARS \nAndorra have gone 4,515 days without a win. \nSan Marino have gone 4,683 days without a win. \nIn total, that amounts to a combined 9,198 days of depressing defeats and insipid draws. Nine thousand one hundred and ninety eight days. That's more than 25 years - and it can all come to an end tonight, with one team set for some very unfamiliar glory. \nUnless, of course, the game ends in a 0-0 draw… Like us on Facebook", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T23:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T18:48:57.914+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
