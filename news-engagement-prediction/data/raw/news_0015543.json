The cat then regains consciousness and is given water to clear its airways. As he makes the first 'meow', a firefighter is heard saying: 'Yes, that's good, talk nicely. Here you are, a little water.' A total of 15 flats had to be evacuated in the fire, which happened last year. Stan Loemers, Sammy's owner, lost all his possessions in the fire but said his cat was the only thing he cared about.
