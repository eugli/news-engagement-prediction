A car, a caravan and a truck were involved in the accident. \nIt's understood that some passengers have critical injuries. Martin De Ruyter \nEmergency services attend the scene of a serious accident on the coastal highway which left a number of people critically injured \nThe accident occurred near the intersection of Maisey Rd and the Coastal Highway. \nAt least 12 police cars responded to the accident and two fire trucks. \nThe Nelson Marlborough Rescue Helicopter landed on the road. \nOther emergency services are en route. \nLast year, residents who live near the intersection of Maisey Rd, Westdale Rd and the Coastal Highway campaigned for the New Zealand Transport Agency to make the road safer before someone was killed or seriously injured. \nHazel Margaret Gill died after a three car crash at the intersection in December 2015. \nResident Mike McGee said at the time her death was the final straw. \n\"Something has to happen. It's just too dangerous. \n\"Just about everybody who lives out here has a story to tell.\" \nMcGee was rear-ended while trying to turn right into Maisey Rd in May, 2013. \nHis van was written off and the driver who hit him was injured, but \"it could have been a lot worse\", he said. \nThe main issue is that there are no right-turning lanes for vehicles entering Westdale and Maisey roads from State Highway 60, meaning drivers have to put on their indicator and wait in the middle of the road for a break in traffic. \nDiversions are in place Gardner Valley and State Highway 60. \nThere is another cordon in place at Mapua Drive. \nMotorists are asked to avoid the area if possible or take diversions where directed. \nMore to follow.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T06:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T01:06:07.643+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
