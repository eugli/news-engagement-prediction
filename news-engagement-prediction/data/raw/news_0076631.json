She shot 18-of-29 from the field, nailing six of her 11 three-pointers. The record-breaker came on a floater with 4:05 left in the fourth quarter of Saturday’s 84-77 win against the Utes. \nWhile career records carry the necessary asterisks due to things like shifting season lengths, gameplay, and official rules, Plum’s march to the record has been one of the more entertaining chases in recent memory, largely because she’s fun as hell to watch .
