(Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Tuesday, January 31, 2017, 6:29 PM \nIt is “not a coincidence” that some of President Trump’s most controversial moments came when two of his closest advisors was observing the Shabbat, according to a report. \nTrump’s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner are seen as a moderating force on the commander-in-chief’s policies, though Vanity Fair reports that he has been out of the loop in critical phases. \nThe magazine wrote that Kushner and Ivanka, who are Orthodox Jews, do not work or use technology from sundown on Fridays to sundown on Saturdays, which is when Trump complained about reports of his inauguration crowd size. \n“He wasn’t rolling calls on Saturday when this happened,” an unidentified source said. “To me, that’s not a coincidence.” \nSean Spicer defends White House statement after omitting Jews \nBeyond that Saturday, chaos surrounding Trump’s travel ban, believed to have been pushed by nationalist-leaning advisor Steve Bannon, also occurred during Shabbat. \nBannon's influence is seen as growing in the administration's first weeks, and the former Breitbart editor has been given a seat on the National Security Council. \nThis Saturday also saw the White House release a statement on the Holocaust that did not specifically mention Jews, which gained national attention despite officials' claims that it was being blown out of proportion.
