I knew what lay ahead for us: marriage, children, a white picket fence. \nWhen we met, I was 20 and he was 22. We had both had only one relationship before. We were young, but we never thought that it wouldn't be forever. I felt so lucky to have found my person so early. SHARE 'The last few years have been an intense time of self-discovery.' Photo: Stocksy \nWe were told constantly what a great couple we were. My parents loved him like their own. My aunts and uncles fawned over him at family gatherings. We integrated seamlessly into each other's friendship groups. For five years we were together, and we were as disgustingly in love in private as we were in public (yes, I was once half of That Couple). \nMost of my friends at the time were single. They'd regale me with stories of dating and sex and I'd listen, wide-eyed, to these tales that seemed like they were from a different planet altogether. They'd go out partying, and I would stay home with my boyfriend. I never felt like I was missing out, but I did wonder what life would be like if I hadn't met him so soon. \nThey say curiosity killed the cat; in our case, it killed the romance. Eventually, I felt like I needed to see what else was out there, and while I loved him, I wasn't in love anymore. So we broke up, when I was 25 and he was 27, and suddenly we were both turfed out into a brave new world. \nThree years later, the tables have turned. In my early 20s, I was knee-deep in a serious relationship while hardly anyone else I knew was – now, a year off 30, I'm on the opposite end of the spectrum while many of my friends have settled down. Advertisement \nFacebook is now a who's who of property ownership, pregnancy, engagements and weddings – all things I once thought were on the horizon for me, too – while my own feed consists of videos of my cat doing weird things. \nIt's been disorienting to find myself going from one extreme to the other. In darker moments, I wonder what's wrong with me – whether I'm not good enough to be someone's forever, whether this trajectory is the result of mistakes I've made along the way, whether being alone is all I deserve. I see anniversary posts on Instagram where couples declare their love. I remember what that felt like, and I wonder if I'll ever have it again. Sometimes it feels awfully lonely. \nBut then I think about the things I used to want, and I think about whether I want them now. Do I really want marriage, children and a white picket fence, or is it just what's always been expected of me? Do I even believe in marriage anymore? Does it have to be a man beside me in the hazy future I so often dream of, or do I only picture it that way because of the path that I always thought I had to follow? Can I be complete without a romantic partner in my life? \nThe last few years have been an intense time of self-discovery, from online dating and casual sex, to experimentation in other parts of my life that I'd never even thought about before, to embarking on a career that is not stable, but always exciting. None of this would have been possible if I had stayed within my comfort zone. I often joke that I'm experiencing my late teens and early 20s now, and while sometimes it feels jarring to be in a different place from most of those around me, at other times it's completely freeing. \nI think about who I was then, and who I am now, and they are two different people. I know I would have never become who I am if I hadn't been brave enough to break my own heart when I was 25. \nI look at my ex and see how he's changed, too. He vowed to be alone for a while after we broke up, and he was, and I saw him transform completely in that time. He has a new partner now, and they recently moved in together. My heart ached, at first, but then it swelled for him. We were meant for different things, and we helped each other find them when we fell out of love and into the world, alone. \nNone of this is to judge those who are happily married, buying houses or raising children – I see so much happiness in their lives, and sometimes I feel a little jealous of what they have. But my cousin – who's married, has a high-paying job, owns three properties and has the cutest pug puppy of all time – once told me that he and his wife envy my comparatively carefree life and the liberties I'm able to take which they no longer can. There are trade-offs and sacrifices for all of us. \nShout out to my HSC English teachers as I close this all with a little nod to old mate Robert Frost – the road less travelled and so on. It has been a strange few years, figuring out who I am and what I want on my own, and wondering if there's something missing in me, or if I'm regressing. Sometimes it hurts a little, but it is my path – and wherever it leads, I know it will be the right place for me.
