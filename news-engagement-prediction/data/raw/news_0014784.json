Share US woman wins $1.3m lawsuit after pedicure causes severe bacterial infection - Yahoo7 A US woman intended to be pampered with a pedicure at her local beauty salon, but it instead left her with a severe bacterial infection that required surgery, so she sued the salon for $1.3 million. \nSamantha Payne, of Richmond Virginia, developed painful boil-like lesions on her legs two to three weeks after a 2012 pedicure from the former Red Nails of T&I salon. \nShe sought medical advice when they didn't go away and doctors concluded she had developed a cutaneous mycobacterial infection, which causes painful sores to form, grow and spread up the legs. The lawsuit was a \"wake-up call\" for salons to be adhere to health and safety standards (like gloves and sanitised utensils as shown in this picture). Picture: File, Colin McConnell/Getty \n\"Multiple surgeries were required to remove the infections, which left permanent scars,\" the law firm representing her, Allen, Allen, Allen & Allen, said in a statement. \n\"It's taken a confident, attractive young lady and made her to be self-conscious about her legs,\" Mr Payne's attorney Jamie Kessel said.
