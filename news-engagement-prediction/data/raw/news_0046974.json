Burrigato will go into ground level of the Sydney Hall apartments (314 15th Ave. SE). Co-owner Korra Ektanitphong said the plan is to open the restaurant in the first week of April. Burrigato's Logo designed by Korra Ektanitphong Burrigat \"Our concept will revolve around the students there,\" Ektanitphong said. \"I love Asian food and my partner loves Chipotle so we thought about a fast Asian place on campus and noticed there was a lack of that.\" Both Ektanitphong and her partner Daniel Ringgenberg were previously managers at various fast food establishments in Minneapolis during their college years, but this is their first stab at restaurant ownership. Burrigato uses the now-familiar Chipotle model — burrito or bowl meals ordered at a counter and quickly assembled. Starting out, Burrigato will have three to four Thai dishes, one Japanese dish and a rotating dish of the month. Ektanitphong said some of the specific offerings will be a Japanese curry, a red-orange Thai curry, garlic black pepper pork stir fry and a vegetarian papaya salad with coconut rice. \"We wanted to bring some signature dishes that I grew up eating in Thailand and put it into a burrito to make it more portable and attractive to students,\" Ektanitphong said. \"The Japanese curry for example is very big staple in the country,\" Ektanitphong said. \"There’s nothing like this in the area and that’s sad to me because it's such a great dish and it works extremely well in a burrito.\" Burrigato will have late-hour options to try and capture the bar crowds. It will be open Sunday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Fridays and Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. Diversified Construction in St. Louis Park is the general contractor for the project. Minneapolis-based Architectural Consortium is the design firm. Dan DeBaun covers food companies, restaurants and retailers.
