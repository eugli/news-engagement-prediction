Sajid Javid has come under fire over the changes Credit: Jack Taylor/Getty \nH is speech represents a significant change of tone after he triggered a backlash from backbenchers at the weekend by blaming criticism of the rates on a “relentless campaign of distortions and half truths”. \nTory MPs said that Mr Javid’s reputation had been significantly “damaged” by his handling of the business rate changes, with one minister drawing comparisons with the introduction of the poll tax under Margaret Thatcher. \nHowever, Conservative allies of Mr Javid said that he had been set up as the “fall guy” for Mr Hammond and that criticism was “deeply unfair, because this is being led by the Treasury”. \nTheresa May’s spokesman said she had full confidence in Mr Javid. Business rates changes - LA \nM eanwhile, ministers were accused of treating small businesses like criminals after figures showed that one in four firms in parts of the UK has been taken to court over unpaid rates. \nA survey by CVS Business Rent & Rates Specialists found that nearly 200,000 businesses were hauled before a magistrate in 2015-16. \nIn three areas – Middlesbrough, Thurrock and Waltham Forest – a quarter of firms faced legal proceedings over unpaid business rates, and experts say that the number unable to pay will increase significantly when new rates come into force. \nThe new rates, which take effect in April and represent the first change in almost a decade, will result in companies paying sums that have been calculated to take into account the rise in property prices since 2008.

There are fears business rate changes could be detrimental to the high street Credit: Martin Rickett /PA \nC riticism of the policy has intensified. One minister compared it with the poll tax revolt. \n“Everyone said it was fine before the bills landed, that there would be lots of winners, then reality hit,” the minister said. \n“There’s a growing realisation about the seriousness of what’s to come.” Tory MPs also warned Mr Javid that he has “lost credibility”. \nOne said: “He’s damaged. He came out of the referendum very badly after flirting with Brexit, then backing Remain. This has only damaged his credibility further.” \nHowever, a Tory MP who supports Mr Javid said: “It feels like Sajid is being the fall guy here when actually he’s not the person that sets the rates. Everyone knows that’s Philip Hammond and yet they are pointing the finger at Saj. It feels deeply unfair because this is led by Treasury.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T06:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T01:42:21.724+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
