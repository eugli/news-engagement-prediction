Of those diners, 62 percent said cost was the primary reason. \nRecent minimum wage increases have prompted some U.S. restaurant operators to raise menu prices while less labor-intensive grocery stores have been able to pass lower food costs on to shoppers. \nThe gap between grocery food prices and restaurant prices is at an historic high. The consumer price index for food away from home was up 2.4 percent year over year at the end of January compared to a 1.9 percent drop for food at home. \nConsumers appear to have noticed. Just over two-thirds of poll respondents said they consider eating at home to be very or somewhat cheap. \nBut that does not fully explain the restaurant industry's woes, said Bob Goldin, partner and co-founder of food industry strategy firm Pentallect Inc. For example, he said, grocers are not reporting blockbuster numbers either. \n\"There's more splintering of the food dollar, and the pie isn't growing,\" said Goldin. \"Where you spend has changed more than the amount you spend.\" \nMaxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson expects weak traffic to continue this year. The chains most likely to buck the trend are those that offer the most convenience, such as Domino's Pizza Inc and Panera Bread Co. \n\"They are tech firms who happen to serve food,\" Anderson said, noting both companies excel at things like online ordering. \nHis view was backed up by poll results: Fifty-five percent said they eat at restaurants because it is convenient. \nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English in all 50 states. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of about 2 percentage points. \n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Cynthia Osterman) Next In U.S.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T22:40:44.784+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
