FB Down Private \nFB Down Private is a subsection of FB Down, but we feel it deserves its own mention. The app lets you grab videos from accounts that users have set to private, even if you can’t see the video on Facebook natively. \nTo download a private video, go to the video’s page on Facebook, press CTRL + U to view the source code, then paste the code into the downloader. Generic Video Downloaders [Web Apps] \nAs you progress through this portion of the list, you’ll notice a commonly recurring theme: most of the video downloaders work with the same set of sites. 9. KeepVid \nKeepVid supports 28 sites. It covers educational resources like Lynda, news outlets like ABC and NBC, and popular amusement sites such as Ebaumsworld and Break. \nOnce you’ve pasted your link, you can choose to save your downloaded file in more than 150 different formats. 10. VideoGrabby \nA simple-to-use web app that supports the majority of the most popular video sites. Type the link and hit Go . 11. YooDownload \nYooDownload is another competitor to the likes of KeepVid and VideoGrabby. It works with YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Vid.me, and SoundCloud. 12. ClipConverter \nClipConverter works with almost any website you can think of (subscription streaming services notably excluded). It’ll even grab videos off the world’s most thriving social network, MySpace! \nThe developers offer a browser add-on for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. 13. OnlineVideoConverter \nBecause so many of these web apps are so similar, I’m only going to introduce you to one more. \nOnlineVideoConverter works with YouTube, LiveLeak, TeacherTube, VK, College Humor, and more. Generic Video Downloaders [Desktop Apps] \nSometimes it’s better to use a desktop app than a web app. They can offer features which web apps cannot replicate. 14. VLC Media Player \nClearly, VLC does a lot more than merely downloading videos. The beauty of using VLC is it’s a program a lot of users will already have installed on their machines, and it negates the need for third-party apps.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T21:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T17:42:06.535+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
