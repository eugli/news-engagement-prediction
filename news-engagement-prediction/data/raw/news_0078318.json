Reportedly, Priyanka was seen having some funny conversation while interviewing Hollywood India TV Entertainment Desk, New Delhi [ Published on: 28 Feb 2017, 14:23:27] Video: Priyanka’s funny moments with Jennifer Aniston at Oscars 2017 backstage The Quantico star Priyanka Chopra, who sizzled at the Academy Awards as one of the presenter, seemed to have some fun at the backstage. Reportedly, Priyanka was seen having some funny conversation while interviewing Hollywood star Jennifer Aniston along with model Chrissy Teigen at the backstage of the 89th Academy Awards. \nPriyanka took to Twitter to share a video, in which she, along with Teigen and ‘Live With Kelly’ host Kelly Ripa, is seen having a funny conversation backstage of the event on February 26 night. They talk about hall pass, something of a tradition in the US where a husband or a wife allows the partner to go bachelor/spinster for a few days. \nAs they are seen having a conversation, they bring in Aniston and ask her about her hall pass. \nPriyanka captioned the video: \"This was too much fun. Chrissy Teigen, Kelly Ripa, Jennifer Aniston. Backstage shenanigans.\" — PRIYANKA (@priyankachopra) February 27, 2017 \nIn the video, Priyanka is seen sporting the body-hugging gown by designer label \"Ralph & Russo\". The gown was done with geometric details with a structured bodice. She paired her gown with towering ivory heels, and accessorised the look with the bare minimum, drawing complete focus to the dress. \nAniston too looked ravishing in a black sequined gown with a thigh-high slit and a plunging neck line. \nOn the work front, Priyanka will be seen alongside Dwayne Bravo and Zac Efron in ‘Baywatch’ film. \n(With IANS Inputs)", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:53:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:17:05.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
