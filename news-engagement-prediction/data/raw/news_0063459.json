A year later the midfielder signed for one - but not in Europe. \nWork permit issues stopped Rogic taking up an offer with Championship side Reading and instead he joined Graham Arnold’s Central Coast Mariners. \nRogic eventually got his move to Europe with Celtic, but right now there’s a young Australian at the Nike Academy who is set to skip that step altogether.

However, he had been unable to sign with any because he didn’t have an EU passport - until now. \nAfter securing his passport, the young defender has been preparing for a number of extended trials with the intention of signing his first professional contract. \nBut Blumberg also doesn’t need to rush his choice. He can spend at least another few months at the academy after signing a new deal in December until May 2017. \nThe starlet says he was always confident he would be re-signed to the Nike Academy, because he started “pretty much all the games in 2016 and is also one of the younger members in the squad”.

Blumberg was just as surprised as anyone when he claimed one of the prized contracts at the Nike Most Wanted trials in Australia. \nHowever, strong and vocal leadership on the pitch in games and training, his ability to play the ball at a quick tempo with high accuracy, his knack of winning 50/50 challenges, and also his general consistency wasn’t lost on the Nike Academy coaches and players.

Source: Supplied \nWHAT’S IT LIKE BEING AT THE ACADEMY? \nBlumberg confesses that he loves every moment at the Nike Academy - and it would be hard for any football-obssessed 18-year-old not to say the same. \n“It has been an unbelievable experience so far, training and playing at one of the best facilities in the world everyday with high quality coaches,” said Blumberg. \n“The professional environment that the academy brings, the facilities that we play on, the teams we playing against, the foods we eat, and the specific focus on just football with no distractions is massive for me; I love doing it everyday. \n“I’ve learnt so much over the past 7 months both on and off the pitch. \n“On the pitch from a defenders point of view, I have learnt a lot about the importance of repetition and mastering defensive qualities. \n“Off the pitch I’ve learnt about the importance of your diet, sleeping well and being patient and waiting for opportunities to arise.” Nike Academy Most Wanted.

Source: News Corp Australia \n“Obviously I’ve got to get through the young Socceroos (Under 20s) camps and impress at an earlier level before getting into the Socceroos. I haven’t been called up to a camp yet but I know Australian players have been called up while at the Nike Academy, so hopefully I’ll get a call up then and impress and get into the squad. \n“I think if I work hard, keep fit, perform consistently and take in all the coaches’ advice, work as hard as I can at every training session, and never leave anything in my tank after every game then I’ll give myself a good shot.” \nBut first thing’s first. \n“The goal? A pro contract, Australian under 20s, under 23s and Socceroos caps.” View All Comments The latest sports news, in your inbox daily.
