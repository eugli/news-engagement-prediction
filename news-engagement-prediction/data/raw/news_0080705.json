The first cut in eight years is intended to boost prices and get rid of a supply glut.\nCOUNTING THE COST: Oil alliance - A new era for oil? \nCrude prices have risen by more than 14 percent since the November pact but are still only trading around $56 a barrel despite record compliance by OPEC and non-OPEC members.\nOPEC officials have repeatedly said the group does not target a specific oil price and their focus is on drawing global oil inventories and helping the market to re-balance.\nInside Story - Oil price wars: competition or control? (25:20) \nBut behind closed doors, Riyadh and its Gulf OPEC allies hope to see a higher level because the low price has pressured their finances and stoked fears of a future supply shortage.\nHowever, they do not want the price to be so high that it encourages rival US shale producers, which were hard hit by the slump in oil prices, to ramp up production again. Advances in technology have made it easier for them to adapt quickly to oil price fluctuations.\nOver $1 trillion worth of oil projects have been canceled or delayed since mid-2014. A decline in investments in future oil projects triggered worries that this could lead to a supply shortage and spike in oil prices.\nOil fields take around four years to develop before production can start whereas US shale oil can now be extracted within a few months of a decision.\n\"In general, something around $60 this year is good. $60 will not encourage that big increase in shale,\" one OPEC source told Reuters news agency, adding that shale oil production is expected to grow by about 300,000 bpd this year.\nSource: Reuters news agency \nTell us what you think", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T19:08:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T14:39:13.000+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
