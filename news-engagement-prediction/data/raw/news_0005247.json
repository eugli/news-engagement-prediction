Just more fake news, according to America , the official magazine of the Jesuit religious order in the United States.\nWhen it came time to write his senior biography for the yearbook, he would make light of the divide between his conservative political beliefs and those of the more liberal faculty and students.\nHe wrote that he founded and led the \"Fascism Forever Club,\" though those with knowledge of the school back in the 1980s say there was no such club. The mention of it in the yearbook was a tongue-in-cheek attempt to poke fun at liberal peers who teased him about his fierce conservatism.\nIt was \"a total joke,\" said Steve Ochs, a history teacher at Georgetown Prep who was the student government advisor during Mr. Gorsuch's junior and senior years at the Bethesda, Md., school.\n\"There was no club at a Jesuit school about young fascists,\" he told America. \"The students would create fictitious clubs; they would have fictitious activities. They were all inside jokes on their senior pages.\"\nNice try with this one, though. It was worth a shot .\nBut if we do hear about any Fascism Forever Club meetings being scheduled on the Hill in coming weeks, we'll keep you posted.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-03T00:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-03T05:28:11.990+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
