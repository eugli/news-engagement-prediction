Although both candidates carry formidable resumes, all attention is focused on 50-year-old Ahok, who has found himself at the centre of controversy. \nWith a blasphemy case against him, frontrunner Ahok's path to re-election is difficult. \nHe is currently under trial for blasphemy charges over a viral edited video showing a Sept 2016 speech he gave in the Thousand Islands regency. \nDuring the speech, Ahok, a Chinese Christian, referenced a Quranic verse, Al-Maidah 51, and told attendees they shouldn't fall for claims by religious leaders who use the verse to justify why Muslims should not be led by non-Muslims. \nThe edited version of the video, which went viral the following month, omitted several words. This made it seem as though Ahok was suggesting that the verse was misleading instead of the religious figures he was referring to. \nThe video has proved to be the most damaging attack on his re-election bid. \nHardliner Muslim groups have staged several demonstrations against him. On Nov 4, hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered in front of the Presidential Palace and the rally ended with two cars set ablaze. \nOn whether the rallies were held on purely religious motivations is hard to say, as there appears to be strong political reasons as well. \nAhok has apologised for the mistake and clarified that he had no intention of insulting the Quran or offending Muslims, but many are still unappeased. \nIn addition to that, his racial and religious heritage may work against him in Jakarta where more than 85% of the electorate are Muslim. The only other Christian governor Jakarta had, Henk Ngantung, held the position more than five decades ago in the mid-'60s, and even then for less than two years. But Jakarta's voter base, urban and largely moderate, could likely overcome the prejudices and focus instead on Ahok's ability to govern a metropolis of over 10 million residents. \nWhile this election may be seen as a proxy feud between the conservatives and the liberals, the sentiments are actually multi-faceted. Take into consideration Ahok's personality for instance. \nHe is known for his tough-talking manner (often eliciting trouble), and strong stance against corruption. Although some Jakartans may not like the style, many credit the man for his effective measures in keeping the city running. As they say, he walks the talk. \nAhok was also inaugurated by President Joko Widodo, or Jokowi, in 2014 and appears to have the support of the hugely-popular president, a backing that may come in handy if margins run thin. \nPre-election surveys are on Ahok's side, with many predicting a win for him. According to most polls, he is expected to win between 30% to 40% of votes. While this can provide some needed breathing space for him, sceptics will still err on the side of caution as unexpected turns are the fad of the season, taking heed of Donald Trump's presidency and Brexit. \nIt should also be noted that Wednesday's election may not necessarily be the finish line. \nIf Ahok fails to achieve a 50% majority, another voting will take place, this time a straight fight between the first and second highest polling candidates. Should that happen, things will look bleaker for him as the Islamist votes will no longer be split between Agus and Anies, but will likely rally behind one of the two effectively pushing Ahok out of the No. 1 spot. \nHis safest bet is to win, and win big on Wednesday. \nThis election, although taking place in Indonesia, is something that should be closely observed by Malaysia. \nSimilar to our neighbour, Malaysia is also struggling with its own form of race and religious tension. There was the 2015 Low Yat brawl, where a case of petty theft got overblown and culminated on social media in a racial one. Malaysia is also facing an undercurrent of racial and religious anxiety in light of growing conservatism and distance in race relations. \nIn some way, this confrontation of values, spurred by political interest, has manifested itself in Indonesia by way of the capital gubernatorial polls. Could the results be an indicator of regional sentiment to racial and religious tolerance? \nOn whether Ahok will survive the polls and continue another five-year term as governor of Indonesia's capital, only time will tell, and the clock is ticking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T07:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T03:06:35.907+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
