Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nOJ Simspon is set to walk free from prison later this year after serving less than a third of his 33-year jail term - it has been reported. \nThe former NFL star was jailed in 2008 after being found guilty of a string of charges including kidnapping, robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. \nOctober 1 is the earliest parole date the 69-year-old could face and Simpson is expected to be recommended for early release due to good behaviour, the Sunday Express reports . \nHe has been serving his sentence at Lovelock Correctional Center in rural Nevada after being convicted over the violent robbery of a sports memorabilia dealer in a Las Vegas hotel room.
