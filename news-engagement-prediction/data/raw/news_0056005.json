(Photo submitted by Roberto Castro) \nRoberto Castro recognizes how easy a streaming service such as Spotify makes listening to music these days. He calls the selection “incredible,” the downloads virtually seamless. \n“Everything is online,” he says. “It’s amazing.” \nAnd yet, the 31-year-old Castro still enjoys taking a vinyl record out of its sleeve, placing it on a turntable and carefully putting the needle into one of the grooves. There is a sense of permanence to the ritual, as well as the music it produces, that contacting the “cloud” can’t provide. \n“I listen to new records on my phone like everyone else, but if I really like one, I'll buy the vinyl just because I want to have it in 30 years,” Castro says. “I want to have a copy of it and have written down when I bought it. I think a lot of people share that. \n“They want to have things they can hold onto, not have everything under their thumb.” \nCastro remembers his mother listening to music on cassette tapes when he was a little boy. But he was 3 years old when CDs first came onto the scene, so he grew into them while vinyl bordered on the obsolete. \nOne of Castro’s roommates at Georgia Tech had inherited a small collection of vinyl records from his father, though, and the two friends got the bug. Looking for record stores later turned out to a great way to pass the time while Castro, a four-time All-American for the Yellow Jackets, competed on the Web.com Tour. \n“A lot of those mid‑sized cities have great old record stores,” he says. “We started a website, me and a couple buddies, at the same time that was kind of general interest music, culture type thing.” \nThe website, now defunct, was called “All Things That Are Good” and included concert and movie reviews, as well as “best of” lists. Castro started writing reviews of the record stores that he frequented. His favorite, “Wax ‘N Facts” is in Atlanta. \n“It’s really old and it’s really dirty and it smells like a record store,” Castro says. “It’s great.” \nTurns out, Castro’s future wife, Katie, shared his interest. She had a record player at her apartment and also had inherited a small collection. Castro’s father might have contributed his records, too, but like so many baby boomers, he gave them up during one of the family’s moves. \n“He had all the Beatles records, all the old like ’60s, ’70s stuff,” Castro says. “… But all that stuff ended up back in the stores, so I probably bought back some of his records at some point.” \nCastro says his collection is modest, maybe 300 records or so. The formal sitting area in their Atlanta house is a music room with two turntables, several speakers and artwork of Ray Charles and Elvis Presley on the walls. \n“It’s not a huge collection, by any means,” Castro notes. “I can make it huge by buying records, but I have them all labeled where I got them, when I got them, so they kind of have a bit of a story behind them.” \nAs for his favorites? Well, Castro always is on the lookout for Sam Cooke records – he has nearly a dozen or so -- and Katie has introduced him to blues artists like Taj Mahal. \n“I like the soul stuff because that's the stuff my wife got me into,” Castro says. “For some reason it seems like that's our section. I kind of like the indie stuff and she has some of the country, but the soul stuff is the stuff we got into together.\" \nTheir daughter, Stella, who is 13 months old, enjoys the music, too. At least, she likes playing with the album covers, some of which are 50 years old and are “pretty much indestructible,” Castro says. \nAnd every time Castro puts on Gillian Welch, a bluegrass, folk and Americana artist, Stella “starts bobbing her head.” \nUnlike some collectors, who look for first editions and other rare finds, Castro is more interested in finding music he likes, music that means something to him or his family. \n“You go to a record store and you can spend 200 bucks on a certain pressing of a certain Beatles album, but I'm not really into that,” Castro says. \nNow, if he could just find that original Townes Van Zandt record that has eluded him since he started collecting. Van Zandt, who died in 1997 at the age of 52, has experienced a resurgence in popularity since the turn of the century. \n“I think the ones that are out there are probably very expensive,” Castro says. “But if I found one, I would buy it. I'm hoping to find one just in the dollar bin or whatever.” Inside the PGA TOUR CASTRO'S VINYL RECORD STORE REVIEWS \nATLANTA, GA \nWax 'N’ Facts — Definitely the grimiest, most old-school record store in Atlanta. When you walk into this Little 5-Points institution, you are sure to walk out with a gem, and most likely for less than $5 or $6. Walking into Wax n’ Facts is like taking a step back in time, the place hasn’t seen a coat of paint since it opened in 1976, dark, musty, jammed to gills with some new and used CDs, but mostly used vinyl. The same three clerks are always there, seemingly judging your tastes, no matter how cool you may consider yourself. (i.e. If you’re buying a Sam Cooke record on vinyl they’ll surely remind you it’s a reissue, and that the original pressings are almost impossible to come-by). \nCriminal Records — Just a block up the street from Wax n’ Facts is Criminal, the place to go to find all the newest releases, some old stuff, comic books, action figures, t-shirts etc. Criminal always has the newest indie releases on vinyl in a rack in the front of the store, and a smaller selection of used vinyl in the back. They also have a large selection of mostly new CDs, but the best thing about Criminal is certainly their regular in-store performances by bands in town to play other Atlanta venues. Recent in-stores include The Morning Benders, Phoenix, and The XX. \nGood Spots Nearby — Little 5 is littered with interesting shops and restaurants. In the one block between Wax n’ Facts and Criminal are: Stefan’s Vintage, where you can find vintage Hermés ties, Fonz-esque leather jackets, and ‘70s-style Sansabelt Slacks; The Porter, hands down Atlanta’s best beer bar; and Killer vibe, great beer, amazing service, and a menu that draws on the owners’ experience in haute-cuisine. The Porter is a must-stop. North of Wax n’ Facts on Moreland you’ll find Junkman’s Daughter, an overblown Spencer’s/Halloween Store, The Vortex-home of arguably Atlanta’s Best Burger, and a great coffee joint, Aurora Coffee. \nDECATUR, GA \nDecatur CD — A self-described “catalog CD store”, Decatur CD is the place to find damn near any CD you’re looking for. It’s the kind of place that when you buy a CD, the owner writes down what you bought in his notebook, ensuring that he’ll order another copy. A small but bountiful vinyl section in the back, but stocked with basically every indie LP in print, including lots of boxed sets. A great store in a cool neighborhood. Good Spots Nearby — To make an afternoon out of it, walk down to the Brickstore for a delicious craft-beer, or wander upstairs to the strictly Belgian Beer Bar, or hit Leon’s Full Service to roll a game of Bocce on their outdoor court and munch on some of their signature pommes-frites. A couple doors down from Decatur CD is Farm Burger, part of that whole sustainable, local, farm-to-table movement, but the result is anything but frou-frou, the burger WILL NOT disappoint. \nFull Moon Records — In historical Candler Park, Full Moon stocks only used gear. Lots of used LP’s, all for around $5, plus a respectable section of $1 records. The CD’s are all $7.99 and the selection is strong, lots of good stuff, very little filler. What’s nice about Full Moon is it’s intimate size. You can browse their whole stock in an hour or so, and will snag a good pickup. \nGREENSBORO, N.C. \nRemember When Records — You would not suspect that the largest stock of high quality vinyl on the east coast would be in Greensboro, but Remember When Records has exactly that (at least according to RW owner, John Hiatt, and if you visit his store, you won’t doubt his claim). \nUpon entering RW, John leads you through a quick rundown of the store, what goes where, and offers a friendly reminder to keep his meticulously organized store like you found it. The store is different than most in that it ONLY stocks high quality vinyl. Every record in the store is graded, from Very Good to Almost Mint. John says only 10 percent of what they come across ends up in the store, the rest ends up in two big warehouses. He acquired a lot of his huge stock of quality goods in the late ‘80s when vinyl started it’s descent into nostalgia. He bought other stores as they went under. He even bought out distributors. It’s probably 80 percent Rock n Roll, but the Soul and Country he does stock is top-shelf stuff, and he has a designated Black Gospel section, a real treat. They also had quite a few super-rare (and super-expensive) records like Elvis Presley’s debut album, first pressing, in mono (price tag: $560). \nIn addition, the store has thousands of VHS and DVD’s, again, maniacally organized for your browsing pleasure. If you are ever on I-40 in North Carolina make sure to stop at Remember When Records. It’s not a place to buy in bulk, no $1 bin here, but it is a real treasure trove of wonderfully cataloged vinyl.
