Photo: handout 8-year-old's killer may be gang member, Houston police chief says 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nTwo days after an 8-year-old girl was fatally shot in the back seat of her mother's car, Houston's police chief suggested on Monday that the killer may be a gang member. \n\"A little girl who was just starting her life (was) shot by a coward,\" Chief Art Acevedo said at a news conference. \"Because that's what these gangbangers are, they are cowards that have no respect for the sanctity of life.\" \n\"If I were to venture a guess, I think it's going to end up being gang-related,\" he added in response to a follow-up question about the slaying of De'Maree Adkins. \"Now, I don't know that definitively. But let's face it, most people don't go out in the middle of the night shooting at people.\" \nThe child's mother, Latoyia Thomas, was involved in a crash about 2 a.m. Saturday at the intersection of Beltway 8 and West Fuqua, according to Houston police. Someone pulled out a gun and started shooting Thomas' car, striking the girl who had been sleeping in the backseat before the crash. \nThomas believes it was a woman who opened fire. \n\"I don't know who it was, and I don't know why she was shooting,\" she told the Chronicle on Saturday. \nAfter shots were fired, the mother didn't realize her daughter was injured until she tried to take her out of the car. That's when she noticed blood on De'Maree's jacket. \n\"I told her to stay with me, stay with me,\" Thomas said, breaking down into tears. \"Her body just went limp.\" \nParamedics transported De'Maree to the hospital, where she later died. Thomas was not injured.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T06:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T02:47:28.310+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
