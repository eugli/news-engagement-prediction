Bri Sudia is the conniving baker Mrs. Lovett opposite the objective of her desire, the murderous barber Sweeney Todd, played by Paul-Jordan Jansen. in the new Paramount Theatre play running until March 19. (Liz Lauren) Philip Potempa Post-Tribune Privacy Policy \nEven though the title character and plot for the eerie, thrilling stage tale of \"Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" are fictionalized for the sake of Stephen Sondheim's now infamous Broadway musical, true tales from the same time period abound. \nJust as \"Sweeney Todd's\" murderous revenge is set in 1847 London, hatchet-wielding Lizzie Borden committed her contrasting crimes in Massachusetts in 1892 when she was accused of killing her father and stepmother. Even closer to home, about the same time, Belle Gunness, the black widow who lived on a farm in LaPorte, was tied to the slayings of nearly 40 people — many wealthy male suitors — prior to her faked death and disappearance in 1908. \nI've never seen the film version of \"Sweeney Todd\" from 2007 starring Johnny Depp. But I have seen a few of the stage incarnations of this story: a wrongfully imprisoned barber and his unlikely villainess bakery shop accomplice who exacted revenge on those who ruined his life 15 years earlier. \nParamount Theatre in Aurora has a new production of \"Sweeney Todd\" that is a cut above anything I've seen previously. It is beautifully dark, and laced with moments of humor and haunting heartache. The play is running until March 19. \nParamount artistic director Jim Corti — teamed with Tom Vendafreddo, leading his 10th consecutive Paramount production as music director and conductor — takes audiences face to face with some of the most foreboding characters in this shiver-worthy stage sensation. \nThe hulking Paul-Jordan Jansen is the accomplished actor who is razor-ready as Sweeney Todd, the man desperate to reclaim his family. Powerful vocals are required to carry the songs and challenging lyrics of this 21/2-hour, one-intermission stage stroll through the streets of London. This large and impressive cast captures every drop of the blood, sweat and tears. \nDiabolical pastry baker Mrs. Lovett is played by Bri Sudia, who is rolling in the dough for one of the best performances in this role since Angela Lansbury first raised the original bloody rolling pin in 1979 on Broadway. Sudia's wild-eyed performance convinces me that her character is capable of baking alley cats and others into her \"meat pies\" as a way to save on her monthly butcher meat bill. \nMatt Deitchman has fun as Adolfo Pirelli, the competing barber rival of Todd's, and Larry Adams is sensational as Judge Turpin, the manipulative man who has taken control of Todd's daughter Johanna, played by Cecilia Iole. Anthony Norman is a fresh and welcomed name as waif Tobias Ragg, and Patrick Rooney is perfectly in tune as the story's hero, Anthony Hope. Other leads are Emily Rohm as the mysterious beggar woman and Craig W. Underwood as the Beadle, who carries out the evil deeds of those in elected power. \nJust as rewarding in this production is a range of talent in the large ensemble, which features easily identifiable, accomplished voices. Classically trained Thomas Forde is in gauntly, valiant operatic range. \nThe production team has Trent Stork as associate director and Kory Danielson as assistant music director/associate conductor. Jeff Kmiec provides stark, brilliant scenic design; Theresa Ham's costume design is a tattered triumph; Nick Belley and Jesse Klug share lighting design; and Adam Rosenthal is the sound designer. With the barber yarn that is connected to this tale, Katie Cordts' wig, hair and makeup design transform every identity with shadow and tangled precision. Amanda Relaford offers detail-driven properties design. \n\"Sweeney Todd\" has been nominated for Tony Awards in three decades. The 1979 production had nine Tony nominations and won eight, including best musical, score and book. A 1990 remount acquired four Tony nominations. When back on Broadway, a 2016 New York revival landed six Tony nods. Paramount's production is sure to snare awards. \nTickets are $44 to $59. \"Sweeney Todd\" is rated PG-13.
