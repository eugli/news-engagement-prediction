Writing on Instagram , Longstreth referenced Migos' current chart-topping hit to pose the question of if the genre is “both bad and boujee?” He asked if indie rock these days is “Bad in the basic sense of like, musically underwhelming ... and boujee in the word’s negative sense: refined and effete, well removed from the raindrops and drop tops of lived, earned experience?” \nPecknold weighed in via Instagram comments, saying as part of a longer message, “to me there is always a vast expanse of feeling being explored by everyone engaged in music and it’s all valid in that it defines a feeling or creates a new one, for whatever group or groups have their ears turned on that music.” \nLongstreth has now elaborated further on his statements with a new Instagram post, as well as several tweets . And Pecknold has continued the conversation on Reddit . A photo posted by @davidlongstreth on Feb 10, 2017 at 10:51am PST \nOn Reddit , Pecknold wrote, “I was trying to say that music doesn’t have to be progressive to be enjoyable. I never said my music was ‘cutting edge,’ that’s not my goal as a musician.” He also said, among other things: It was a defense of those artists / indie rock, I was saying that music doesn’t need to be progressive to be enjoyable. The points I tried to make were fully unitarian. And if people aren’t allowed to use big words to light-heartedly mull over small, innocuous subjects, you might as well shut down the university system entirely. Can someone hit me with a jpg for “tfw ppl call you pretentious for saying unoriginal music is enjoyable and that all expression is valid” \nOther artists, including Sadie Dupuis, Waxahatchee, and Cloud Nothings, shared their views on indie rock, as well as Longstreth and Pecknold’s initial discussion. music twitter is mad about a roundtable of frontmen, meanwhile i won't even look at the table if frontmen are the only people seated — sadie dupuis (@sad13) February 10, 2017 extremely grateful that i am making music in this era, so many cool, hardworking and fucking talented people are killing it. it inspires me.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T06:44:59.032+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
