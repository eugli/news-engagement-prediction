It was his third goal in nine starts to go along with his six assists. \nMabil produced a small mask as part of his celebration which he explained after the match. \n\"I got it when I was on holiday at home in Australia in December. My little brother is a big Ninja Turtles fan, and I promised to wear it when I scored,\" said Mabil to Esbjerg's website. \nFellow Aussie Brent McGrath also completed 90 minutes for Esbjerg. \nAlso in Denmark, Chris Ikonomidis was on target as his side, AGF, went down 2-1 to AaB, meaning he and teammate Mustafa Amini could face Mabil's Esbjerg in a relegation play-off in five weeks' time. \nElsewhere, Brad Jones kept another clean sheet, his 14th in 22 matches this season, as Feyenoord won 1-0 over ADO Den Haag. Feyenoord are on course to win the Eredivise title, five points clear at the top with 13 matches remaining. 6️⃣games played after the winter break...6️⃣ clean sheets! \n— Feyenoord Rotterdam (@Feyenoord_int) February 19, 2017 \nMat Ryan was in goal for Genk in their 1-1 draw with Sporting Charleroi. Jason Davidson, Ajdin Hrustic and Kenneth Dougall were all on the bench as Sparta Rotterdam and Groningen played out a 2-2 draw.
