That’s important because 2016 wasn’t a great year for the company, it stopped providing annual shipment numbers amid reports that sales had dropped below the 70 million-plus it sold in 2015. Xiaomi thinks that a new strategy, which includes designing its own silicon — something only Samsung, Apple and Huawei currently do — and growing its offline retail presence can turns things around. \nSo what of the Surge S1. Well, it’s an octa-core 64-bit processor that Xiaomi said runs up to 2.2GHz. In terms of tangible developments that you’ll see in phones running the chipset, Xiaomi claimed it is 40 percent more power efficient (thanks to its quad-core GPU), while call quality will be clearer. The chip can also improve photos, it added, with better low light scene shooting and increased light sensitivity. \n“For Xiaomi, the move is an essential next step in our development. In order to deliver on our promise to make innovation available to everyone, we need to master the core technologies of our industry and tightly integrate the development of our hardware with our software, helping us to make even better smartphones that will consistently surprise the industry and delight consumers,” Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun said in a statement. \nXiaomi added that the process to create the chipset has taken 28 months, starting October 2014. It put forward some benchmarking data for those who are into the details: Benchmarks? You be the judge. #SurgeS1 pic.twitter.com/dZ1RoVbKl5 \n— Mi (@xiaomi) February 28, 2017 \nChipsets are all well and good but phones are what people buy and use. \nThe Mi5c will sell for 1,499 RMB ($220) in China which makes it a budget Mi5. The device includes a fingerprint sensor on the front, a downgraded 12-megapixel rear camera, 3GB RAM and 65GB of storage. Xiaomi said that using the Surge S1 gives the device those aforementioned camera, power and performance benefits. mi5c_1 ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-28T15:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-28T10:19:23.049+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
