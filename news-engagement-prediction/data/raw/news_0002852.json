The first being 2007 World T20 triumph, being No 1 in Tests in 2009, the 50-over World Cup victory in 2011 and 2013 Champions Trophy win in England.\n\"Inspirational. Captain par-excellence. Thank you - #TeamIndia @msdhoni,\" BCCI tweeted on its official handle with a picture of the whole squad.\nThe felicitation happened before the last match of T20 the series and Dhoni is next expected to be seen in India colours only during the Champions Trophy. Since he had announced the decision to step down before the start of the series, the team, in its own sweet way, wanted to offer him a vote of thanks for his leadership.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T18:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T07:20:28.394+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
