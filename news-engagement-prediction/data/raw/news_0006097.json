Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had supported moving DeVos’ nomination out of committee on Tuesday, but on Wednesday said they would oppose her when the full Senate votes.\n  Senate Confirms Former Exxon CEO Tillerson As Secretary Of State Trump Tweets Photo Of Prayer After Gorsuch Announcement Report: Obama May Be Positioning Himself For Confrontation With Trump “I come to the floor to announce a very difficult decision that I have made, and that is to vote against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos to be our nation’s next secretary of Education,” Collins said.\n“Her concentration on charter schools and vouchers however raised the question about whether or not she fully appreciates that the security of education’s primary focus must be on helping states and communities … strengthen our public schools,” Collins said. “I am troubled and surprised by Mrs. Devos’s apparent lack of familiarity with the landmark 1975 law, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.”\nMurkowksi then followed with a similar announcement.\n \n“I have serious concerns about a nominee to be secretary of Education … who has been so immersed in the discussion of vouchers,” Murkowski said.\n“I do not intend to vote on final passage to support Ms. DeVos to be secretary of Education,” she added.\nThe defection of Murkowski and Collins means that unless a Senate Democrat breaks ranks — and none to date have indicated they will do so — the vote on DeVos would be a 50-50 tie.\nIn that case, the tie-breaking vote would be made by Vice President Mike Pence, and would likely result in DeVos being confirmed.\n  Obama’s Statement Supporting Protests Of Trump’s Executive Order Ticks Off MSNBC Host 2 GOP Senators Vow To Oppose DeVos On Senate Floor Trump Cancels Signing Of Cybersecurity Executive Order DeVos, a proponent of school choice, has been fiercely opposed by teacher unions. DeVos has never worked in the education sector.\nHowever, Margaret Spellings , who served as a secretary of education under George W. Bush, supported the embattled nominee.\n“This is the era of the states and I expect that she’ll be an honest broker and a great leader for all of our schools,” Spellings told CBS Wednesday morning.\nSpellings praised DeVos for her work “over the many decades that she has been involved on the battlefield fighting for school reform and fighting for students in Michigan and around the country.”\nDespite being a supporter of vouchers, DeVos maintains “an open approach to where those educational opportunities are provided, whether they’re in charter schools or private schools or any kind of schools,” Spellings said.\nWhat do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T20:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:16:08.076+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
