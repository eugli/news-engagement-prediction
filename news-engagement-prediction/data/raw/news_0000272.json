Printers make noise, keyboards make noise, the mouse, the cooling fans, even the capacitors on the motherboard emit ultrasonic noise. In 2004, Dmitri Asonov and Rakesh Agrawal used a neural network to analyse the sound produced by computer keyboards and keypads used on telephones and automated teller machines (ATMs) to recognize the keys being pressed. \nAlso in 2004, Adi Shamir, Eran Tromer and Daniel Genkin demonstrated that its possible to conduct timing attacks against a CPU performing cryptographic operations by analyzing from ultrasonic noise emanating from capacitors and inductors on computer motherboards and implemented a successful attack on RSA on laptop running GnuPG. Active acoustic \nA malware dubbed BadBios was reportedly uncovered by security consultant Dragos Ruiu in 2010, which used high-pitched sounds inaudible to the human ear in order to communicate. The existence of this malware is disputed, but the alleged method of communications is feasible. \nIn 2013, Michael Hanspach and Michael Goetz used the computer speakers and microphones to construct a covert channel utilizing audio modulation/demodulation on the near ultrasonic frequency range (17kHz-20kHz) and demonstrated how a covert acoustical mesh network can be conceived via ultrasonic audio communications. Fansmitter is a malware that can acoustically exfiltrate data from air-gapped computers, even when audio hardware and speakers are not present, because it utilizes the noise emitted from the CPU and chassis fans. DiskFiltration is another software that is able to exfiltrate data but it uses acoustic signals emitted from the hard drive by manipulating the movements of the hard drive actuator, using seek operations so that it moves in specific ways, generating sound. Light \nLight can also be used for data exfiltration. The usual light emitting device on a computer (a.k.a. the monitor) can be the immediate choice but there are others, like the keyboard LEDs. Other equipment that have LEDs or displays might also be used for the purpose of implementing this kind of covert channels, such as printers or modems. On the input side, light reading sensors from smartphones or even scanners have been used to demonstrate how to send data to a compromised device. Passive light \nIn 2002, M.G. Kuhn, et al., proved it was possible to reconstruct the CRT screen’s contents analyzing the light intensity of the displays diffuse reflection off a wall. This is possible because the light intensity of the last few thousand pixels drawn by a CRT leaked a low-pass filtered version of the video signal. LCDs were not vulnerable to this particular attack but Backes, et al., showed that the contents of liquid crystal display (LCD) screens could also be reconstructed by analyzing diffuse reflections off objects in the environment (e.g., teapots, eyeglasses,bottles, spoons, and a wine glass). With telescopic lenses, it was shown to work from 30 meters away. \nAgain in 2002, J. Loughry and D. A. Umphress demonstrated that the LED status indicators on data communication equipment are shown to carry a modulated optical signal that is significantly correlated with information being processed by the device. Many different sorts of devices, including modems and routers, were found to be vulnerable. It is possible for an eavesdropper that can measure the LEDs light intensity to infer the information being sent/received through these devices. Active light Blinking Scroll Lock \nHasan, et al., shown that is is possible for a mobile phone’s ambient light sensor (ALS; used for auto-brightness and other features) to register changes in light emitted by screens (LCD/TV) and proved that a low bit-rate exfiltration channel could be implemented with the screen as the emitter (e.x. a laptop screen) and a mobile phone with ALS present in many smartphones nowadays as a receiver. \nJ. Loughry and D. A. Umphress implemented software that transmits ASCII data by modulating the Caps Lock LED with serial data at 50 bits/s. They show that at a high enough rate, a regular user would not notice the blinking LED. Transmissions using infrared (IR) light were also researched at some point, but interest was lost since most modern computers no longer include IR hardware. \nAt the Black Hat Europe conference in 2014, Adi Shamir, Yuval Elovici and Moti Guri showed how a malware infected computer on an air-gapped network could receive and send attack commands through a multi-function printer’s scanner that the computer is connected to. To transmit data, an attacker would need to shine light, visible or IR, into the room where the scanner is and while a scan is in progress. The slightly different shades of white in the scanned document represent the binary code for the issued command. Seismic \nSeismic or vibrational communication is a process of exchanging information through mechanical vibrations. Under certain conditions, it’s possible to induce vibration through a computer speaker. Almost all phones and smartphones have the ability to produce seismic waves using the vibrator. Passive seismic \nMarquardt, et al., were able to demonstrate a side-channel attack to reconstruct the keystrokes typed on a keyboard located in close proximity (a couple of inches maximum) to an accelerometer-equipped cell phone. The keystrokes were detected using only the vibration and not the sound of the key being pressed. \nAt CanSecWest in 2009, researchers showed how they used a laser pointed at the back of a laptop to infer keystrokes. The keystrokes would cause the laptop to vibrate which they could detect with the laser listening device and then use techniques similar to those in speech recognition to determine what sentences were being typed. Active seismic \nHasan, et al., devised a way to explore the low-frequency sounds from the speakers to induce vibrations in the surroundings. Note that this is not using sound per-se as a medium (although sound is a mechanical wave) but using sound to make something vibrate. The vibrations could then be picked up by an accelerometer. Systems with subwoofers make this even easier as they are able to produce louder, low-frequency sounds which result in stronger vibrations. \nDeshotels demonstrated that Android devices, in contact with one another, could communicate using vibration signals lasting as little as 1 ms and the vibrations would be imperceptible to humans. Halevi and Saxena demonstrated that the mobile phone’s vibrations produced an acoustic signal which could be picked up by a regular microphone from up to three feet away, a mix between seismic and acoustic channels. Magnetic Digital compass app \nIt’s hard to find a smartphone these days that doesn’t have a compass. A chip with magnetometer capabilities is responsible for measuring the magnetic field and detecting the position of magnetic north. But it’s a sensor like any other we’ve seen, with a little imagination this too can be abused as a communication channel. \nHasan, et al. explored the hypothesis of a malware receiving commands via a magnetometer (for example, an electronic compass app). The signals to transmit to the device are modulated using a custom built electro-magnet to induce changes in the detected magnetic field of the magnetometer. They managed to prove error-free communication was possible over a distance of 3.5 inches, but a greater distance is likely possible with a stronger electromagnet. In any case, there are challenges in achieving large distances since a magnetic field’s strength is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance from the source. Thermal Thermal imaging \nAll electronic devices generate excess heat and require thermal management to improve reliability and prevent premature failure. Computers are no exception. This is usually done with fans and we’ve already seen how they can be abused to provide an exfiltration channel. Changes in temperature are shown to be an effective, albeit painfully slow, data channel. \nMirsky, et al., demonstrated how an Internet-connected air-conditioning system could be remotely controlled by an attacker to send commands to malware on an air-gapped system using a one way thermal covert channel. Mordechai Guri, Matan Monitz, Yisroel Mirski, Yuval Elovici created BitWhisper, a software able to bridge the air-gap between adjacent compromised computers (up to 40cm) by using their heat emissions and built-in thermal sensors to create a covert bidirectional communication channel (up to 8 bits per hour). Electromagnetic \nMaybe the most known covert channel is via radio-frequency (RF) and because of that it’s likely to be the most researched. Bell Labs originally noted this vulnerability back in WWII when Bell Telephone provided the military an encryption device called a 131-B2. They had one working in their laboratories when, by accident, someone noticed that each time the machine stepped, a spike would appear on an oscilloscope in a distant part of the lab. They studied these spikes more carefully and found out that they could read the plain text of the message being ciphered by the machine. This was probably one source of inspiration for the TEMPEST program . \nSide-band electromagnetic radiation emissions are present in pretty much all electronic equipment, especially if it is unshielded. Passive RF \nThe popular Van Eck phreaking, named after Dutch computer researcher Wim van Eck who publish a paper about it back in 1985, allows an eavesdropper to clone a CRT monitor’s contents by remotely detecting its electromagnetic (EM) emissions. In an unshielded CRT monitor tests were successfully conducted from a distance of 1km as well as a distance of 200m for a shielded monitor. Furthermore, in 2005 Kuhn demonstrated that LCD screens are also vulnerable to a similar attack. \nWireless keyboard sniffing is widely known but wired keyboard sniffing… not so much. Martin Vuagnoux and Sylvain Pasini demonstrated that the electromagnetic emanations from wired USB and PS/2 keyboards could be recorded and keystrokes decoded from up to 5m distance. The same guys that showed how they used a laser pointed at the back of a laptop to record motion and recover keys also devised a way to sniff characters from a PS/2 keyboard by monitoring the ground line in an outlet 50 feet away. Last year a team of researchers, including Daniel Genkin, Lev Pachmanov, Itamar Pipman, and Eran Tromer, managed to monitor the EM leakage of a laptop on a specific frequency while the laptop was decrypting a ciphertext using elliptic curve encryption (ECC). The signal contained information about the operands used in the ECC operation, enough to recover the secret key. Active RF \nThe video card leaks a lot of EM emissions and it turns out it can be manipulated to transmit in chosen frequencies. AirHopper is a software that turns a computer’s video card into an FM transmitter, which can be captured by a standard FM radio, even the ones that are built into a smartphone. William Entriken created a System Bus Radio — a C library that can make a computer emit radio waves even if the device doesn’t include any radio transmission hardware. \nIn 2015, Mordechai Guri, Assaf Kachlon, Ofer Hasson, Gabi Kedma, Yisroel Mirsky and Yuval Elovici managed to exfiltrate data from a computer over GSM by invoking specific memory-related instructions and utilizing the multi-channel memory architecture to amplify the transmission up to 30m. They used a basic low-end mobile phone with GSM network with modified firmware to receive the data. Last year, Mordechai Guri, Matan Monitz, Yuval Elovici disclosed a paper showing how a software can intentionally generate controlled electromagnetic emissions from the data bus of a USB 2.0/3.0 connector that can be detected with a SDR dongle. Other Channels \nThe topic of air-gap covert channels is just fascinating. It keeps showing that sometimes reality can be even more interesting than a spy movie plot, with all those impossible gadgets. It speaks to the very essence of what hacking is all about, when you put together a seeming impossible problem, an incredible dose of imagination, and out of the box thinking to break and bend the rules and reach a working solution. To question everything, to accept no boundaries or limitations and to have an holistic view on what a system is and not what you’re told the system is, might very well be the key to finding other channels or methods to bridge the air-gap. \nThis article was not meant to feed the reader’s paranoia.
