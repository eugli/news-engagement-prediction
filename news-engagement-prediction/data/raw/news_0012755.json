Notifications now slide out along the bottom right of your screen and each is accompanied by a chime, which can be irksome whenever files are added to your Dropbox or you plug in a new device. RELATED ARTICLE How to Use and Configure the New Notification Center in Windows 10 \nNow that notifications are cataloged in the Action Center , you can view notifications you might have missed. So, if you still want to see notification banners in the lower-right corner of the screen, but you find the notification sounds annoying, you can turn the sounds off without fearing that you might miss important notifications. \nTo access Windows 10’s notification settings, click the notifications icon in the taskbar’s system tray area, then click the “All settings” button. \nOn the main Settings screen, click the “System” option. \nClick the “Notifications & actions” category. \nUnder the “Notifications” section, the “Get notifications from apps and other senders” option allows you to turn notifications completely off. \nBelow the main Notifications options, there are options to disable certain apps from displaying notifications. You can also choose notification settings for each of these apps individually. To customize notifications for a specific app, click on that app in the list. For example, we want to see notifications from Outlook when we get new emails, but we’d rather not hear a sound every time, so we click “Outlook 2016” in the list. \nTo disable the notification sound for the selected app, click the “Play a sound when a notification arrives” slider button so it turns white and reads Off. You can also set various other notification settings on this screen, such as whether you want to see notification banners, keep notifications private on the lock screen, show notifications in the action center, and the number of notifications visible in the action center. \nTo close the Settings window, click the “X” in the upper-right corner. \nYou have to turn off the notification sounds for each app separately. But, once you do, you can enjoy getting notifications without the annoying chime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T17:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T17:36:06.910+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
