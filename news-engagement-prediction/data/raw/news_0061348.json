His mother began to blame the grandfather for this. She suspected that the grandfather, who allegedly doesn't approve of her, tattled on her to her husband for what he called irrelevant expenditure.\n\"She held up directly responsible for their financial situation. This caused minor flare-ups between the man and the daughter-in-law. Whenever the child asked for money, the mother told him that his grandfather was scheming against them,\" said Mahadev Waval, senior inspector of Vakola police station.\nResentment builds \nLast week, when the young boy again asked his mother for some money, she told him, in a fit of anger, to ask the grandfather. \"The mother painted the grandfather as a villain who didn't want to the family to live happily. This enraged the boy and he waited to seek his revenge,\" said Waval.\nRead Story: IAF man murdered, chopped body recovered in 16 polythene bags \n\nAround 1 pm on February 19, the boy left home without telling his mother, bought a paper cutter, boarded a train for Santacruz and then headed for Kalina — where his grandfather resides — to exact his vengeance.\n\"When he reached the grandfather's house, he picked an argument with him. The boy accused him of making his mother and him starve,\" said a Vakola police officer.\nAttacks grandpa \nThe argument soon blew up into a scuffle during which the boy allegedly stabbed the 75-year-old's in the chest, shoulder and face.\nHearing the man's cries, his daughter, who lived next door, rushed to the house.\nAunt attacked \nWhen she intervened, the boy allegedly bit her hand in fury. Neighbours finally came to the old man's rescue and overpowered the boy. The elderly man and his daughter were taken to VN Desai Hospital in Santacruz.\nBased on a complaint from his aunt, the boy was booked under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapon) of the IPC, said Yogesh Langute, Vakola police sub-inspector. The boy was sent to the children's rehabilitation home in Dongri.\nDeep wounds \nMahadev Waval, senior inspector of Vakola police station, said the grandfather sustained two nearly 4-inch-deep stand wounds to the chest, one across the shoulder to the throat and another on the face. He was discharged on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T07:02:33.474+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
