(LIVEBLOG) \n“We were in a pretty decent position when Rahul and Ajinkya were batting, but once Rahul got out, we lost those four wickets for four or five balls. But then, you are bound to have a bad day,” Kumble told the media after the day’s play. \n“There were a couple of soft dismissals . Certainly this pitch was a challenging one and needed more restraint… you need to mix your aggression and caution. Credit to the Australian bowlers.” \nIndia crashed to 105 all out as Australia grabbed the initiative, reaching 143 for four in the second innings to extend their overall lead to 298. \nPUJARA PRACTICES FACING THE BOUNCER \nAs the crowd began melting away after a disappointing day for India, a few fans were huddled near the North-east stand holding the iron fence as Cheteshwar Pujara took guard in the nets. The setting sun was in their eyes, but they ignored that. They just wanted to watch an India player bat without having to pray he doesn’t get out. He had been caught behind off Mitchell Starc’s short delivery which rose sharply. \nOverseeing his practice were Kumble and assistant coaches Sanjay Bangar and R Sridhar as Pujara faced a few bouncers hurled at him with the side-arm (bowling equipment). \nKumble had addressed the media before coming down to the nets. He was clearly unimpressed with the batting, but kept a straight face as he backed his players. \nINDIA DIDN’T ADAPT TO CONDITIONS \nOpener KL Rahul and Ajinkya Rahane had steadied the ship after twin strikes from Mitchell Starc had reduced India to 44/3. But spinner Steve O’Keefe sent back both of them and Wriddhiman Saha in one over as India lost the last seven wickets for 11 runs. \nKumble said: “It’s a surface that was there and you have to adapt. We didn’t adapt that well. Probably if you look at yesterday, the first 80 runs (of the Australia innings) were in the first session and then the last 60 runs for the last wicket. I think that slightly took us away from where we were wanting to restrict Australia. \n“Once Rahul and Ajinkya had that partnership (50 for the second wicket), that’s when we could have consolidated and got closer to their score and even got a lead, but it was just a poor day.” \nPraising O’Keefe, who wrecked the Indian batting by taking six for 35, Kumble said: “He bowled consistently in good areas, and there were a couple of soft dismissals and that pushed us back. It was one of those days where Jadeja bowled in the last session and was probably beating the bat almost three times every over. On another day it could have taken an edge or got a wicket… O’Keefe pitched it (right) and got the results.” tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T03:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:20:25.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
