He added that most of the factory was running as normal. \nThe local fire department, however, said on its microblog that the fire was caused by batteries inside the facility. \nThe “material that caught fire was lithium batteries inside the production workshops and some half-finished products”, the Wuqing branch of the Tianjin Fire Department said in a post on its verified Sina Weibo account. It added it had sent out 110 firefighters and 19 trucks to put out the fire. \nSDI is set to start supplying batteries for Samsung’s upcoming flagship smartphone Galaxy S8 in the first quarter of this year. The S8 replaces the Galaxy Note 7 mode, which suffered a global recall last year due to battery defects. \nSamsung said last month that SDI and China’s Amperex Technology Ltd, the two battery suppliers for the Note 7, were to blame for the product failure that cost it $5.3 billion in operating profit. \nThe Tianjin plant is one of five production centers by SDI in China and a major one for small batteries used in phones. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-09T21:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:53:39.028+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
