'Reality check' \nDespite insisting he has no desire to be in politics now, he makes very pointed criticism of the atmosphere around the debate, warning that voters are essentially being misled saying: \"People have been led to expect a future that seems to be unreal and over-optimistic. \n\"Obstacles are brushed aside as of no consequence, whilst opportunities are inflated beyond any reasonable expectation of delivery.\" \nIn his first public comments since the vote, the former prime minister is offering what he describes as a \"reality check\". \nAnd he sounds alarm bells too about the tone of the debate, saying Brexit's \"cheerleaders\" have shown \"contempt\" to Remainers, shouting down dissent \"against our traditions of tolerance\". \nWhile he is not seeking to be unhelpful to the government, Sir John plainly has doubts about Number 10's handling of the process so far - the \"rosy confidence\" being offered to the British people. \nAnd in the depths of his speech there is another warning for Theresa May about the Tory MPs she has worked so hard to keep on side - \"today they may be allies of the prime minister, the risk is that tomorrow they may not\". \nMight Theresa May face her own \"bastards\" one day? \nIn recent weeks, with Theresa May determined to keep the Tory party together, and Labour struggling to stay united, the momentum has most certainly been with those celebrating our journey toward the exit door. Political pressure \nMinisters, even those who were ardent Remainers, privately sound increasingly optimistic about the prospects of doing a deal. But Sir John Major is not alone in having fundamental concerns. And his voice is harder for the government to dismiss, as they did Tony Blair a couple of weeks ago. \nOne senior figure even told me some of the talks behind closed doors have been a shambles, and raised concern that the government, all of us, are a long way from understanding the full implications of the decision. \nYet with almost the only political pressure on her coming from the right, Theresa May has decided to emphasise the opportunity, not the risks. The government is well aware that things could go wrong, but one minister told me \"we all have to discover the reality together, when the rubber hits the road\".
