Audio: Why effective altruism could change the world (Life Matters) \nThe Effective Altruism group promotes \"partner charities\" that it says have been \"thoroughly and independently investigated, and are supported by swathes of supporting academic literature\". \nProfessor Singer dismissed suggestions that a calculated approach to donations might go against the spirit of charity for some people. \n\"When we want to do things for ourselves, if we want to buy a new laptop, we do research,\" he said. \n\"And if someone told us, 'Oh you could have got just as good a laptop for half the money', we are upset with ourselves. But nobody tells us that, or at least nobody used to tell us that, with charities. \n\"And that's what the Effective Altruism movement is trying to do â€” it is putting research out there online that shows which are the most effective charities you can donate to.\" External Link: Peter Singer TED talk: The why and how of effective altruism Effective Altruism draws critics \nThe Effective Altruism philosophy has come under criticism in the past for being \"moralistic\" and having the potential to push people towards larger, established charities. \n\"[It] is an approach that not only unjustifiably claims the moral high ground in giving decisions, but also implements this bold claim by weighing causes and beneficiaries against one another,\" non-profit sector consultants Ken Berger and Robert Penna wrote in the Stanford Social Innovation Review . \n\"In this, it is not moral, but rather, moralistic in the worst sense of the word.\" \nProfessor Singer said the underlying philosophy was simply about making sure each dollar had the biggest impact, and that many smaller charities made the list. \n\"In a way [smaller groups] are easier to evaluate,\" he said. \n\"Because charities that do just one thing, like distribute bed nets or prevent people going blind or do cataract operations, they are easy to assess what you are getting for your money.\" \nProfessor Singer will be a key speaker at Friday night's launch and will be joined by 2005 Australian of the Year Fiona Wood and the global lead of development effectiveness at The Fred Hollows Foundation, Kirsten Armstrong.
