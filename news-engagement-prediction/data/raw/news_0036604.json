Photo: US Navy In an unusual move for President Trump, his pick to replace ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn wasn’t alarming. Retired Vice-Admiral Robert Harward is a former Navy SEAL who previously served as Defense Secretary James Mattis’s deputy when he led U.S. Central Command. Under another administration, people might care that Harward is currently a senior executive at the defense contractor Lockheed Martin, but he’d be replacing an official who espoused a number of Islamophobic beliefs and had possibly illegal chats with the Russian ambassador. Under Flynn, the National Security Council was reportedly understaffed and dysfunctional, but it looked like Harward might bring some stability.\nHowever, it seems Harward is also too stable to want any part of the Trump team. The administration had been wooing Harward even before Flynn resigned, but following two meetings at the White House, he announced on Thursday evening that he’d turned down the offer.\n“Since retiring, I have the opportunity to address financial and family issues that would have been challenging in this position,” Harward said in a statement. “Like all service members understand, and live, this job requires 24 hours a day, seven days a week focus and commitment to do it right. I currently could not make that commitment. My thoughts and prayers are with those that carry such heavy burdens and responsibility for taking care of our country’s national security concerns. God bless this great country of ours.”\nSources told the Washington Post that in addition to family and financial concerns, Harward was put off because the White House wouldn’t guarantee that he could select his own staff.\nA person familiar with Harward’s thinking told Politico that he was concerned by the “unwillingness of White House political team to be deferential to the White House national security team” and “unwillingness of [the] White House political team to be malleable.”\nOne of Harward’s friend had a more colorful way of putting it:\nA friend of Harward's says he was reluctant to take NSA job bc the WH seems so chaotic; says Harward called the offer a \"shit sandwich.\"\n— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) February 17, 2017 Tags: top story trump administration white house robert harward national security adviser michael flynn Trump’s Pick to Replace Flynn Turns Down Job Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories More White House Chaos Over Anti-Immigrant Policy Draft Paul Ryan’s Dream of Tax Cuts for the Rich Will Not Be Denied Andrew Sullivan: The White House Mole Most Viewed Stories The White House Mole Psychologists Think They Found the Purpose of Depression Jared Kushner Takes Trump’s Complaints About CNN to Time Warner Executive Former Obama White House Photographer’s Instagram Is a Master Class in Shade Trump Ends the Presidential Press Conference As We Know It Why Your Dog’s Personality Is a Lot Like Yours Donald Trump Thinks He’s Good at Being President Melania Trump Is Reportedly ‘Miserable’ in Her Role As First Lady The Great Wall Is Wonderfully Ridiculous Trump Somehow Found a Way to Insult Women at the Unveiling of an Airplane Most Popular Video On Daily Intelligencer The Wildest Moments From Donald Trump’s Press Conference Latest News from Daily Intelligencer 28 mins ago Upper East Side Parents Are the Latest Trump Resisters An elite boarding school allegedly had to cancel a field trip to the Central Park’s Trump-affiliated Wollman Rink.\n4:10 p.m. More White House Chaos Over Anti-Immigrant Policy Draft The Associated Press has a draft of a memo that suggests deploying as many as 100,000 National Guard troops.\n3:19 p.m. Senate Confirms Leading Opponent of Environmental Regulation As Head of the EPA Scott Pruitt will spearhead the Trump administration’s efforts to increase water pollution and accelerate man-made climate change.\n2:54 p.m. R.I.P.
