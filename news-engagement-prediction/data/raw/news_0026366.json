To those of Jewish descent, rest assured that we stand with you and vow to continue the effort to educate others.’ \nAn estimated 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. The University has been forced to apologise (Picture: Google maps) \nMORE: Boy’s cute application letter for job of ‘professor of Lego’ at Cambridge University \nDamon Brown, director of student activities and involvement at CMU, said in the statement that members of the Republican student group were ‘shocked and remorseful.’ \nThe student group also issued a statement on Wednesday stating that it was not responsible for the anti-Semitic card. \nAt tonight’s College Republicans meeting, we had a Valentine’s Day party, in which each member decorated a bag and other members placed valentines inside of others’ bags. Unfortunately, a very inappropriate card was placed into a bag without other members’ knowledge. A bag was then given away to students sitting in Anspach [Hall], once again without members’ knowledge of its contents. \nThe College Republicans as an organization did not distribute this valentine. We in no way condone this type of rhetoric or anti-Semitism. We apologize for any offense and want students to know that we do not tolerate this sort of behaviour.’ \nA picture of the card was subsequently shared on social media, causing outrage across the campus. \nWriting on Facebook , one person wrote: ‘No matter what your political stance is (this is coming from a conservative), this is sick and unacceptable. \n‘I am disgusted at how a group that is supposed to be representing the same views I hold could say something so offensive and not see an issue with it. Absolutely ashamed.’ \nWhile another said: ‘Holocaust Remembrance Day was only a couple weeks ago. Not only is this in bad taste, but from a prominent political group on campus, I would expect they would have better judgement. Meme or not, this is over the line to distribute to someone.’ ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T20:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T02:41:03.153+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
