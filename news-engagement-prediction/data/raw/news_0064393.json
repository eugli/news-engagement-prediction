It fits in with a district that’s been resurgent in recent years, with projects like the Scioto Mile and the overhaul of the old City Center site bringing a new flair to the city’s core. 19 photos The residential population in the area bounded by Interstates 670, 71 and 70, and the CSX railroad tracks running through the Scioto Peninsula continues to grow according to the new State of Downtown Columbus report prepared by Capital Crossroads & Discovery Special Improvement Districts. About 8,100 people lived downtown at the end of 2016, 132 percent more than in 2000, the report found. With that kind of demand, it’s no surprise housing projects are going up all across the district. In fact, there are 19 housing projects under construction downtown. Check out the slideshow to see renderings and photos of all of them, including the number of units, developer and whether it’s a rental or a condo project.
