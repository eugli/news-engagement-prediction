And he even invited them round for tea in his one-bedroom flat as her body decomposed in the closet, they claim.\nBut Victoria, whose death has left relatives heartbroken, had in fact not been by anyone since October 2015.\nHer family filed a missing persons report and Greater Manchester Police officers found her body during a raid on January 16 this year.\nBolton Crown Court heard that police are still investigating the cause of her death.\nNick Ross, defending Reade, said:\nThis is a very unusual case, a very difficult and sensitive case and a very serious case.\n– Nick Ross, defending Credit: MEN Syndication He said there had been a post mortem but that police were still analysing toxicology results and making further investigations.\nThe length of time for which this body appears to have rested in an airing cupboard will have made the pathological tests more difficult.\n– Judge Timothy Stead The court heard a psychiatrist would see Reade, who will await sentence on remand at Forest Bank Prison.\nThe defendant, who wore tracksuit trousers and a blue anorak, spoke only to enter guilty pleas to two charges.\nThe first was intending to prevent the lawful and decent burial of Victoria Cherry and concealing her body between October 1 2015 and January 16 2017.\nAnd he admitted intending to pervert the course of justice by giving misleading and inaccurate information about the whereabouts of Victoria Cherry to police officers, pharmacists, and family members.\nReade, who was warned to expect a ‘custodial sentence of some length’, was remanded in custody until April 13.\nCredit: MEN Syndication Neighbours have told of their grief, shock - and disbelief that Reade managed to keep Victoria’s body hidden for so long.\nAfter the hearing friends of the couple described Victoria as a ‘quiet and lovely’ mum and grandmother.\nGary Sleeman, 37, said the case had shocked the community, adding:\nVicky was so lovely, she had so much time for everyone and made you feel better about yourself.\nThis is a tragedy.\n– Gary Sleeman He said he had spent many hours at the house before the death - and had even stayed there as Reade’s friend since her disappearance.\nHe added:\nHe said she had left him. I’d sleep on their couch regularly - while Vicky was there and afterwards.\nI’ve slept right near the cupboard where she was. I can’t explain it, there are so many feelings going on at once.\nI feel shock and I feel tragedy for Vicky.\n– Gary Sleeman Glen Kerwin, 54, lived next door to Reade for three years.\nHe said:\nIt’s sad - Vicky was a nice girl, really pleasant to get on with.\nDodgy smells started coming through but Andy explained it away. He told us it was from an older occupant that used to live there before him.\nHe also dragged an old carpet into the hall to mask it and had air freshener.\nIt’s shocking that he kept her body in there so long. He told me she had up and left.\n– Glen Kerwin Glen, who would often watch fooball at Reade’s home, said:\nWe had no reason to doubt him. He said he’d gone back to her mum’s. He kept up a good front.\nHow did he manage to keep it under wraps for so long?\n– Glen Kerwin Bolton", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-17T18:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-17T14:52:18.015+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
