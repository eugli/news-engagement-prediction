PUBLISHED: 06:03, Mon, Feb 13, 2017 | UPDATED: 06:38, Mon, Feb 13, 2017 GETTY Mesut Ozil has struggled for form in recent weeks \nThe Germany international has struggled for form in recent weeks, having gone three games without a scoring goal or providing an assist. \nAnd according to The Telegraph , Wenger could drop Ozil when Arsenal travel to face Bayern Munich for their Champions League last 16 first leg on Wednesday. \nThe Gunners manager admitted he's keen to \"protect the second fixture\" when they host Bayern on March 7, which could mean fielding a more defensive XI at the Allianz Arena. \n“It’s important that we protect the second game,” Wenger said. “We must go there, not hide, but defend well as a team.” \nWenger also acknowledged Ozil's decline in form after Arsenal's 2-0 win over Hull on Saturday, in which Alexis Sanchez bagged a brace. \n“I felt he was not completely confident technically,” said Wenger. “That’s a problem because you think he can deliver something special. \n\"He did things that he is not used to doing. He needs to find confidence again. He misses chances that don’t look unfeasible.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T13:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T08:43:48.400+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
