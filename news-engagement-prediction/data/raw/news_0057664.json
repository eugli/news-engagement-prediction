(Photo: Isaac LAWRENCE / AFP) Tsang, famous for his bow ties, was escorted in handcuffs to the court from hospital where he had been staying since Monday night after experiencing breathing difficulties and chest pains.\nScores of establishment Hong Kong figures including top former officials had wrote letters vouching for Tsang's good character and longstanding public service over four decades in a bid for mitigation ahead of sentencing.\nThe nine-person jury had earlier found Tsang guilty of a charge of misconduct in public office. He had deliberately concealed private rental negotiations with property tycoon Bill Wong Cho-bau while his cabinet discussed and approved a digital broadcasting licence for a now defunct radio company, Wave Media, in which Wong was a major shareholder.\n\n\nDonald Tsang, center, former leader of Hong Kong, is escorted in a prison bus leaving the high court after sentencing and mitigation after his conviction last week for misconduct in public office, in Hong Kong Monday, Feb. 20, 2017.
