They belong to the force and are highly valued resources. “PD Ivy is very young and has many years' service ahead of her. She will therefore stay with the force and be re-handled with another officer. “We understand that there has been a great deal of public interest in this case following the initial decision earlier this year. CATERS The policeman was left 'heartbroken' following his superior's decision He is heartbroken. He is trying to put on a brave front and have meetings with West Mercia to try and come to some conclusion but he is absolutely devastated at the thought of losing Ivy Jennifer Evans “As a result I met with Sergeant Evans to discuss the matter and offered a number of options. Unfortunately, these options have been rejected and so the original decision stands. “I would like to thank Sergeant Evans for more than 34 years’ service across West Mercia Police and I wish him a long and happy retirement.” Sergeant Evans’ family have vowed to carry on the campaign to keep Ivy. Jacob Windsor, “chief supporter” of the family’s campaign, said: “Jennie has confirmed that the family are utterly devastated and shocked by the decision. CHANGE.ORG Thousands have signed an online petition in support of sergeant Evans “She has also confirmed that she will not give up this fight, and I will continue to support her and the family in their continued plight to get West Mercia Police to change their decision. “Jennie would wholeheartedly, and with ‘abundant appreciation’, like to thank the 35,287 people across the world who have signed the petition in the last fortnight, and very much hopes that they will continue to support her.” Earlier this month, Ms Evans had told supporters how her father father had only “one request” before he retired from the force in April: that Ivy could retire with him. She said: “Unfortunately, West Mercia Police have other ideas for Ivy and thinks separating her from Dave by putting her into the hands of another handler is a ‘sensible’ thing to do. CATERS The family will continue to fight to overturn the decision “They are reluctant to take into consideration the distress and heartbreak that would be caused by removing Ivy from the loving home she has with Dave and his family, the heartbreak, not just for us but for Ivy. “Anyone who owns a dog knows the bond that is made and the distress that can be caused by separation.” During a lifetime’s police service, Sergeant Evans' family have seen 12 ex-police dogs live out their days at their home in Market Drayton, Shropshire. CATERS Ivy has spent almost five years by sergeant Evans' side Sergeant Evans has offered to pay for Ivy as well as cover the cost of getting a replacement dog. Ms Evans said: “He is heartbroken. He is trying to put on a brave front and have meetings with West Mercia to try and come to some conclusion but he is absolutely devastated at the thought of losing Ivy. “He is willing to offer anything he can to try and get West Mercia to change their minds. And he is overwhelmed at the support that the public have shown him.” Related articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:53:17.862+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
