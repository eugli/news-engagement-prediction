I don't think this can be stopped until the right example is set,\" he added. \nThe PCB in 2015 pushed the ICC to allow tainted left-arm pacer Mohammad Aamir to resume playing cricket even before his five-year ban for spot-fixing ended in September 2015. \nAamir, along with former captain Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif, were found guilty of spot-fixing during the fourth Test against England at Lord's in late 2010. \nThe ICC's anti-corruption tribunal banned them for a minimum of five years in early 2011 and their bans expired in 2015 after which all three are now back playing cricket. \nThe PCB's decision to allow back Aamir has also come under criticism from some former players who believe that players once punished for corruption and spot-fixing should be banned for life. \nPakistan's former Test captain Ramiz Raja also told a news channel yesterday that Sharjeel and Khalid should not be allowed back. \nAsked by the host whether he would like to see Sharjeel and Khalid back to playing cricket after serving their punishments, Ramiz said: \"Over my dead body.\" \nFormer players say the PCB set the wrong example by allowing Aamir back into the national team on the basis that he was young when the spot-fixing scandal took place in 2010. \n\"You can't show leniency in such cases. Once a player is found guilty of soiling the game and his country he should be told to leave cricket for ever. But unfortunately in Pakistan cricket set up we still have some players who have been accused of fixing in the past,\" former Test opener Mohsin Khan said.
