The meeting, which lasted over 2 hours, is believed to have convinced the government to change its position. \n“The police hierarchy had assured the chief minister they would manage the NHRC,” said a member of the CM secretariat, “After the NHRC session, the government was worried that it could be held responsible for the excesses by the police.” \nAccordingly, he was sent on medical leave on February 2. The next day, police officials submitted a six point action plan to protect human rights in Bastar which included the creation of district level human rights committees. \nYet Kalluri continued to rail against the government on his Whatsapp group. “Bela Bhatia wins… going on long leave.. sorry for failing you,” he wrote in one such missive, an allusion to the human rights activist who had been attacked at her home in Jagdalpur on January 23, 2017 by a mob who accused her of supporting Maoists. \nThe attack on Bhatia prompted a national outcry, forcing the CM to assure her she was free to continue her work . Finally when he announced his return to Bastar on February 6, the government, officials said, had enough. tags ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T08:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T19:55:36.248+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
