Bangalore is a team which boasts of the best batting lineup in the IPL led by captain Virat Kohli, Chris Gayle and AB de Villiers. With their batting order well-settled, RCB were looking to add local Indian bowlers in their arsenal. ( IPL 2017 auction: Stokes, Mills pocket fat pay cheques ) \nAmong the five bowlers that RCB bought at the player auctions, one cricketer stands out from the rest. Rajasthan fast-bowler Aniket Choudhary was bagged for a Rs 2 crore right after they shelled out a whopping Rs 12 crore for England pacer Tymal Mills. ( IPL 2017: How the teams stack up after the auction ) \nAniket is a left-arm fast bowler who can work up decent pace and bounce on a regular basis. He was recently in the news for his role for India A, taking four wickets in the warm-up game against Bangladesh. ( AUCTION HIGHLIGHTS ) \nAniket has taken 124 wickets in 39 first-class matches for Rajasthan at an impressive average of 27.44 with 5 five-wicket hauls.

Aniket was included in the mix to help the team counter the pace and bounce of Australia's left-arm seamer Mitchell Starc. ( Ben Stokes worth the risk for Pune Supergiants, feels coach Stepehen Fleming ) \nStarc was a vital member for RCB since he joined the franchise in 2014, even though he played only two tournaments for them. He missed the entire 2016 season as he was recovering from a foot fracture. In 2014, he took 14 at 28.71 apiece, with an economy of 7.49, and in 2015 he claimed 20 wickets at 14.55 apiece with an economy of 6.76. \nBut Starc announced his decision to part ways with the franchise on Sunday and will skip the IPL this year to focus on his rehabilitation ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy in June. \nAniket, 27, will now be expected to play an important role for RCB in IPL 10 along with Mills, who impressed with his pace and variations during the ODI series against India last month. \"Not just A Chaudhary, with 2 Crows he is The Chaudhary\" - This and more @NagsMr gems in this video from #IPLAuction ! #PlayBold pic.twitter.com/3lQi6u1TWf â€” Royal Challengers (@RCBTweets) February 20, 2017 For more news from India Today, follow us on Twitter @indiatoday and on Facebook at facebook.com/IndiaToday For news and videos in Hindi, go to AajTak.in . ताज़ातरीन ख़बरों और वीडियो के लिए आजतक.इन पर आएं.
