Photo: Rachel Murray/Getty Images for Glamour Caitlyn Jenner has chimed in on the Trump administration’s decision to revoke federal guidelines aimed at protecting transgender students in public schools. In an Instagram post shared Thursday evening, Jenner begins her message by directly addressing transgender teens who are impacted by the reversal in school policy. “I have a message for the trans kids of America,” she begins. “You are winning. I know it doesn’t feel that way today or every day, but you _ are _ winning.” Jenner continues the post by directing supporters of the “winning side” to the National Center for Trans Equality, where they can find ways to help. She then directs her attention to the “bullies” in the matter and, finally, addresses President Donald Trump in the accompanying video. \n\nI have a message for the trans kids of America. You are winning. I know it doesn’t feel that way today or every day, but you _ are _ winning. You are going to keep on winning so much you’re going to get sick of winning. Very soon, we'll win full freedom nationwide, and it’s going to happen with bipartisan support. For all our friends out there, If you want to be part of this winning side, you can help by checking out the National Center for Trans Equality and letting Washington hear how you feel loud and clear. (Link in bio!) Now…I also have a message for the bullies. You suck. You’re losers and you’re going to keep on losing. Because you’re weak, you pick on kids or you pick on women or anyone you think is vulnerable. Apparently even becoming the Attorney General isn’t enough to cure some of you of your insecurity. As proof that you can’t stop our progress, the Supreme Court will soon hear an important Title Nine case thanks to the courage of a brave young man named Gavin Grimm. See you in court! \nA post shared by Caitlyn Jenner (@caitlynjenner) on Feb 23, 2017 at 5:17pm PST \nIn addressing the “bullies,” Jenner writes: “You suck. You’re losers and you’re going to keep on losing. Because you’re weak, you pick on kids or you pick on women or anyone you think is vulnerable.” Jenner also takes a swipe at Attorney General Jeff Sessions, though she doesn’t mention him by name. While the new memo to public schools is jointly signed by the heads of the Department of Education and Justice, the New York Times and other outlets have reported that Sessions is the one who spearheaded the move to revoke the previous guidelines on trans youth.\nThe Obama administration saw the protection of trans youth in schools as falling under Title IX, which prevents discrimination based on sex. Their federal guidelines dictated that school districts receiving federal money allow students to use the facilities (i.e., bathrooms and locker rooms) of their choice. That policy has since been challenged in court and Sessions cited the current litigation as reason for revoking the guidelines.\nThe larger issue of transgender rights is still, however, scheduled for deliberation before the Supreme Court next month when it hears the case of Gavin Grimm. Grimm, a young trans students from Virginia, came under the national spotlight in 2015 when he sued his school district for instituting a policy dictating students must use the bathrooms corresponding with their gender at birth. While the Supreme Court could opt to not hear the case anymore after the Trump administration withdrew the policy that spurred the litigation, both sides are pressing for a decision. “If anything, the confusion caused by this recent action by the Department of Justice and the Department of Education only underscores the need for the Supreme Court to bring some clarity here,” said Joshua Block, a senior staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union, according to NPR .\n\nIn Jenner’s Instagram video, she directly addresses President Trump. Jenner, a Republican, was one of the notable celebrity guests at a pre-Inauguration dinner for Trump. Trump’s decision, however, to approve the rollback of protections for trans youth in public schools is clearly not sitting well with Jenner. “This is a disaster and you can still fix it,” Jenner says in the video. “You made a promise to protect the LGBT community. Call me.”\n\nThis post has been updated throughout. \nRelated Trump Administration Revokes Guidelines Aimed at Protecting Transgender Students Tags: donald trump caitlyn jenner transgender rights transgender issues bathroom bills politics More Caitlyn Jenner Calls Out Trump In Message for Trans Youth   Rereading The Handmaid’s Tale , One Month Into the Trump Era Why Did Everyone Act Like I Was Crazy When I Decided to Have a Baby in My 20s?
