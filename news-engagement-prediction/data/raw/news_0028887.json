Foyt’s historic victory in 1972. \nThe 1971 Daytona 500 was a heartbreaker for Foyt, running out of fuel near the end of the race, which allowed seven-time champion Richard Petty to win his third of seven total Harley J. Earl trophies. \nIn 1972, Foyt once again had the car to beat. This time, he capitalized on it. \nFoyt dominated the race, leading 167 of 200 laps in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing Mercury en route to Daytona’s sacred Victory Lane. Foyt celebrates in Victory Lane after winning the 1972 Daytona 500.   Images/RacingOne \nIronically, Foyt earned his only Daytona 500 victory in the 14th running of the event, a number he made so famous in what is now known as the IndyCar Series. \nFoyt was the second driver to win both the Indianapolis 500 and Daytona 500 behind Mario Andretti. \nThe win also paved the way for “Super Tex” to become the only driver to have recorded victories in the Indy 500 (four times), Daytona 500, 24 Hours of Le Mans (1967), Rolex 24 at Daytona (1983, 1985) and the 12 Hours of Sebring (1985).", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-12T21:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-12T16:40:41.755+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
