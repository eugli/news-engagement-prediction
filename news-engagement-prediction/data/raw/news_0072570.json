Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nThe New York Times will be running an advertisement during tonight’s Oscars broadcast. Here is the ad, focusing on “truth.” The New York Times has a new marketing campaign: \"The truth is more important now than ever.\" pic.twitter.com/FLPPIozpXn \n— The New York Times (@nytimes) February 23, 2017 \nCNN wanted to make sure to cover this ‘historic’ story. The @nytimes is running its first television ad in seven years during the #Oscars . The subject? The truth. https://t.co/EyV8YDvb5z pic.twitter.com/FomTN1Dykh \n— CNN International (@cnni) February 26, 2017 \nPresident Trump took a preliminary swipe at the ad this morning. For first time the failing @nytimes will take an ad (a bad one) to help save its failing reputation. Try reporting accurately & fairly! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 26, 2017 Trending HA! Women's March asks men how they'll support 'Day Without A Woman', men answer HILARIOUSLY \nRepublican strategist Rory Cooper takes the ad and its premise apart. What I don't get about the NY Times ad campaign is that it is targeted at its base audience and employees. Won't encourage any new converts. \n— Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) February 26, 2017 If you're going to do the first campaign in your newspaper's history it should seek to grow your audience, not make yourself feel better. \n— Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) February 26, 2017 \"The truth is more important now than ever\" just begs the question, why wasn't it important for the previous 8 years? \n— Rory Cooper (@rorycooper) February 26, 2017 \nBingo. It is amazing how many news organizations are just now determining that “truth” is a big deal. This is particularly hypocritical when thinking about how President Obama literally went after members of the media and there was largely silence in response. The @nytimes buries the key info at the end of its story on Immigration agents–they felt blocked by Obama. pic.twitter.com/2wednNcGtg \n— Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) February 26, 2017 \nAntics like that are exactly why the “fake news” label fits so perfectly and sticks to them. They can’t help but be biased and engage in an all-out assault on everything Trump does. The truth is the #FishwrapOfRecord no longer has a monopoly on what the truth is…and they HATE it. https://t.co/o4CyrL52bQ \n— Michelle Malkin (@michellemalkin) February 26, 2017 \nThe election of Donald Trump illustrated the massive credibility gap from which mainstream media outlets, like the New York Times and CNN, are suffering. The lack of trust from the populous has been increasing for decades, but it was accelerated last year with the manner in which Trump was covered on the campaign trail. New WSJ poll shows that more than half of Americans think the media is too critical of President Trump https://t.co/Srhqbl7lRk \n— Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) February 26, 2017 \nThe “truth” is that confidence in their product has diminished to basically nothing, and running a television ad will not restore it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T00:52:08.317+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
