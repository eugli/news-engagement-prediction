The Massachusetts senator joined Trevor Noah for a surprise appearance on The Daily Show Wednesday night to discuss that now-viral moment, which has inspired her supporters to seek out King's letter on their own, especially in the wake of Sessions's confirmation as attorney general. “Millions of people are now reading Coretta Scott King's letter,” Warren said. “It is an amazing letter. It is a letter full of passion. It is a letter full of heart.” King's letter, written in 1986 to oppose Sessions's potential appointment as a federal judge, criticized him for attempting to “intimidate and frighten elderly black voters. For this reprehensible conduct, he should not be rewarded with a federal judgeship,” wrote King. Warren tried to read the letter at Sessions's confirmation hearing, but Republicans barred her, citing rules about impugning a fellow senator. The decision instantly sparked backlash from citizens all over the country, who praised Warren for trying to read King's moving and essential words. “It talks about a moment in history when African Americans were beaten away from the polls, and it talks about Jeff Sessions’s role in that,” Warren said on the Daily Show. “And I think it has an important lesson today for all of America.” The viral moment also inspired a surprise feminist rallying cry of sorts. After Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell barred Warren from speaking, he explained his action with the following statement: “She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted.” Many are now taking his quote and placing it in the context of iconic women who broke barriers in American history. What's most egregious to Warren, however, about McConnell and his party's actions that night is the way they chose to defend Sessions's past behavior. “[Coretta] talks about what Jeff Sessions directly did as the U.S. attorney for Alabama,” Warren said. “And you notice the Republicans are not saying, ‘Hey, those aren’t the facts, or something has changed, or he did all these other things afterward.’ No—what they’re saying, ‘You don’t get to talk about that.’” Share ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T19:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-10T14:26:39.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
