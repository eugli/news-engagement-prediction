It is a stigmatizing insult to the mentally ill (who are mostly well behaved and well meaning) to be lumped with Mr. Trump (who is neither).\" It is insulting to the dignity of the mentally ill to confuse their deep suffering with Trump's petulant tantrums & petty disappointments. https://t.co/8nw8p3ghEC — Allen Frances (@AllenFrancesMD) February 14, 2017 As others have noted before , just because someone constantly exhibits \"bad behavior,\" it doesn't mean they're \"crazy\" or \"certifiable.\" It could just be a symptom of entitlement—the notion of grabbing what you want , never paying the consequences, and continuing the cycle of privilege.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-16T06:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-16T08:27:42.721+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
