Dubai has already done away with free afternoon parking. Free afternoon parking in Sharjah is likely to end soon with new parking boards being put up across the emirate.Images of parking boards showing paid parking from 8 am to 10 pm are doing the rounds on social media.While there is no official confirmation from the authorities yet, the move, if put into place, is in line with a proposal floated last November to end free afternoon parking.At present, residents enjoy a three-hour free parking period, from 1 pm until 4 pm.Earlier in 2016, Dubai removed the similar free afternoon parking period starting May 28, with parking hours in the emirate now running straight from 8am until 10pm on working days.
