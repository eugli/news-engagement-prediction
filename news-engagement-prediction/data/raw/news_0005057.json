The comedian screen-shot Trump’s tweet and posted it on Instagram alongside an impassioned caption. Schumer questioned the president’s focus on the senator’s alleged tears at a time when “his first soldier” and “eight Yemeni women and seven children died“ in an air raid on central Yemen on Sunday. Schumer also spoke out against the ongoing immigration ban, urging her followers, “We need to fight this now and together. Call Congress. Call the Senate.” Trump’s original comment about the senator occurred during an Oval Office photo-op on Monday. The president said he noticed Schumer “with fake tears” at a Sunday press conference at which the senator spoke out against the president’s travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries. “I'm going to ask him who is his acting coach,” Trump said. Amy Schumer hit back at Trump’s allegation that the senator was able to cry on cue in her Instagram essay. “I know Chuck Schumer and HE CANNOT act trust me. He can barely smile on cue. He can't help but be transparent and genuine. He was hurt for those people and all the people facing such unconstitutional injustice,” she wrote. Despite her defense, the New York Post reported that the senator was met with roughly 3,000 protesters at his Brooklyn home Tuesday night. They reportedly chanted such phrases as “Show Some Spine Schumer” and “Resist Trump.” The protesters were angry about what they saw as Schumer’s complacent stance on Trump’s cabinet picks, though after the protest was announced last week, Schumer declared Monday that he would oppose most of Trump's remaining cabinet nominees.
