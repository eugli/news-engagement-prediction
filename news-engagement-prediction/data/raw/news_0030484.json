As expected, social media users wasted no time in responding to the tweet with jokes and fake Quote: memes of their own. The GOP shared a photo of the Lincoln Memorial accompanied with the Quote: : \"And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.\"\nIBT Media to host AI and Data Science in Capital Markets event\n\"His leadership brought us together; his legacy inspires us all. Happy Birthday, President Lincoln!\" the GOP's tweet read.\nHowever, according to Quote: Investigator, there is no \"substantive evidence that Lincoln used the expression\". The website says the earliest appearance of the adage was used in a 1947 advertisement for a book on aging by Edward J Stieglitz.\nGordon Ramsay gives his fans brutally honest reviews of their amateur dishes on Twitter\nThe ad, which reportedly ran in the Chicago Tribune read: \"The important thing to you is not how many years in your life, but how much life in your years.\"\nThe site said the Quote: was attributed to former Illinois governor and Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson II at one point as well, who used a version of the adage in speeches back in 1952.\n'Draconian' changes to UK espionage laws branded 'full frontal' attack on whistleblowing\n\"QI would tentatively credit Edward J.

It is also possible that earlier instances exist that QI has not yet located.\n\"Adlai Stevenson did use the saying on more than one occasion while giving speeches. The attachment to Lincoln is currently unsupported.\"\nMultiple Quote: s websites including BrainyQuote: .com, Goodreads and QuotationsPage.com among others also mistakenly attribute the Quote: to Lincoln.\nPresident Donald Trump's Instagram account also posted the same image with the caption: \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY Abraham Lincoln!!!\"\nAs expected, people were quick to mock the Republican Party's gaffe on Twitter and swiftly flooded social media with their own fake Abraham Lincoln Quote: s and hilarious memes.\nSocial media users also poked fun at the US Department of Education after its official Twitter account misspelled the name of W.E.B. Du Bois, an African-American sociologist, historian and civil rights activist that was accidentally spelled \"DeBois.\"\nThe department apologised for the error, which came during the Black History Month, with a subsequent tweet that had another typo, which was later corrected.\nYou may be interested in:\nApple CEO Tim Cook: Fake news is 'killing people's minds' Trump administration will keep saying 'fake news' until media 'stops attacking the president' White House adviser Kellyanne Conway ridiculed over 'Bowling Green massacre' claims GOP mistakenly tweets fake Abraham Lincoln Quote: , sparks hilarious memes on social media", "external_links": ["http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/draconian-changes-uk-espionage-laws-branded-full-frontal-attack-whistleblowing-1606231?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=rss-inner&amp;utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news&quot;", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ibt-media-host-artificial-intelligence-data-science-capital-markets-event-1592278?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-inner&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/gordon-ramsay-gives-his-fans-brutally-honest-reviews-their-amateur-dishes-twitter-1606254?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-inner&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trump-administration-will-keep-saying-fake-news-until-media-stops-attacking-president-1605318?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-related&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/white-house-adviser-kellyanne-conway-ridiculed-over-bowling-green-massacre-claims-1604620?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-related&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/apple-ceo-tim-cook-fake-news-killing-peoples-minds-1605975?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-related&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/ibt-media-host-artificial-intelligence-data-science-capital-markets-event-1592278?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=rss-inner&amp;utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news&quot;", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/gop-mistakenly-tweets-fake-abraham-lincoln-quote-sparks-hilarious-memes-social-media-1606200?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-related&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/gordon-ramsay-gives-his-fans-brutally-honest-reviews-their-amateur-dishes-twitter-1606254?utm_source=yahoo&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=rss-inner&amp;utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news&quot;", "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/draconian-changes-uk-espionage-laws-branded-full-frontal-attack-whistleblowing-1606231?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=rss-inner&utm_content=/rss/yahoous/news"], "published": "2017-02-13T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T12:16:00.411+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
