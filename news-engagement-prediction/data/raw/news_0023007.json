Notley was scheduled to meet with leaders from the agriculture and agri-foods sectors later in the day. \n\"What we learn from these roundtables will inform our plans going forward, specifically as they relate to upcoming discussions around trade,\" she said. \nDetails around the trip — including who will accompany the premier and who she will meet with in the U.S. capital — have yet to be worked out. \nOne of the main goals will be \"to get in front of as many people as we can, to describe how much the relationship with Canadian business actually benefits American business.\" \n\"Because that is ... not something that is front and centre in the minds of policy makers in the U.S.,\" she added. \nThe U.S. is the province's largest trading partner, with $80.6 billion worth of exports heading south in 2015 and $19.7 billion worth of imports travelling north. \nAlberta is also the largest supplier of natural gas to the U.S., exporting 4.2 billion cubic feet per day south of the border in 2015. Agriculture is another key sector, accounting for $4 billion in exports from the province to the U.S. in 2015. \nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau is due in Washington on Monday to discuss Canadian values and jobs with U.S. President Donald Trump, as the pair meet in person for the first time.\nMORE ALBERTA NEWS |  'Check your ego': How to get a job in Alberta's recession MORE ALBERTA NEWS |  Unemployment rate in Calgary drops slightly in January​", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-10T17:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T00:38:43.489+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
