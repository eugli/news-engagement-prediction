Bernstein/Getty Images) \nWASHINGTON (CBS SF/AP) — The Trump administration ramped up its war against the press Friday, blocking several major outlets from a scheduled White House press briefing. \nThe New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, CNN and Politico were among the news organizations excluded from the meeting, reportedly an untelevised gathering with the press instead of the usual on-camera briefing with White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer. \nThe CNN communications team tweeted out a response to the action, calling it “an unacceptable development by the Trump White House.” CNN was blocked from WH @PressSec 's media gaggle today. This is our response: pic.twitter.com/8SfY2uYKEI \n— CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 24, 2017 \nThe New York Times also responded to the move. \n“Nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties,” New York Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet said in a statement. “We strongly protest the exclusion of The New York Times and the other news organizations. Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest.” \nAccording to the New York Times, reporters from Time magazine and the Associated Press decided not to attend in protest of the White House’s actions, though those two news organizations were set to be allowed into the briefing. \nSo far, there has been no immediate explanation from the White House. \nEarlier Friday, President Donald Trump unloaded on the news media for using anonymous sources — just hours after members of his own staff insisted on briefing reporters only on condition their names be concealed. \nUnleashing a line of attack that energized an enthusiastic crowd at the nation’s largest gathering of conservative activists, Trump said unethical reporters “make up stories and make up sources.” \n“They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name,” he declared. “Let their name be put out there.” \nTrump told the Conservative Policy Action Conference that while not all reporters are bad, the “fake news” crowd “doesn’t represent the people. It will never represent the people and we’re going to do something about it.” \nTrump didn’t expand on what he had in mind or which news organizations he was talking about. But his broadsides represented an escalation of his running battle against the press, which he has taken to calling “the opposition party.” \nThe president has chafed at a number of anonymously sourced stories, including numerous reports describing contacts between his campaign advisers and Russian intelligence agents, which the White House has sharply disputed. \nHowever, members of his White House team regularly demand anonymity when talking to reporters. That was the case Friday morning when Trump officials briefed reporters on chief of staff Reince Priebus’ contact with top FBI officials concerning the Russia reports. \nTrump’s appearance at CPAC represented a triumph for both speaker and audience — each ascendant after years when they were far from the center of the political universe. \nElizabeth Connors of New York recalled past gatherings as collections of the “downtrodden.” \nToday, she said, “it’s energized” after years in which “we’ve been just pushed down, pushed down, pushed down.” \nNicholas Henderson of Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, was there in his “Make America Great Again” hat and pronounced Trump’s speech rousing. \n“He touched on a lot of things we’d already heard before, which is reassuring, tells us he’s still committed to those promises he made during the campaign,” Henderson said. \nTrump, who first appeared at CPAC as a reality TV star six years ago, recalled his past visits with nostalgia, saying the crowd helped put him on the path to the presidency. \n“I loved the commotion,” he said. “And then they did these polls where I went through the roof and I wasn’t even running, right? But it gave me an idea.” \nFrom there, Trump’s latest speech played out like a greatest hits reel from his 2016 campaign. \nHe reminisced about his victory in the Republican primaries. He vowed to “build the wall” along the Mexican border. He denounced Hillary Clinton’s characterization of some of his supporters as belonging in a “basket of deplorables.” \nThe crowd responded to his Clinton criticism with chants of “Lock her up!” just as they did at Trump rallies last year. \nFurther blurring the line between candidate and president, Trump departed the stage to the Rolling Stones’“You Can’t Always Get What You Want,” the same exit music he used during his campaign. \nAs for his criticism of anonymous sources, Gregg Leslie, legal defense director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said such arrangements are “essential to good reporting” in many cases. \n“There are just some things that people will come forward about anonymously that they cannot discuss openly,” Leslie said, citing potential threats to jobs and even personal safety. \nThe Associated Press uses anonymous sources only if the material is factual information, not opinion or speculation, and is vital to the news report. It must come from a person who is reliable and in a position to have accurate information. \nAll presidents have their moments of tension with the press, but Trump’s first weeks in office have brought a frontal attack unlike anything from any other president. \nAfter his newest jibes, Trump turned his CPAC speech into a recitation of his top agenda items, promising bold action on health care, trade, immigration, energy and more. \n“One by one, we’re checking off the promises we made to the American people,” he said, telling the group, “I will not disappoint you.” \nHe told the conservatives the health care law he inherited from President Barack Obama threatens to bring about “total catastrophe,” reiterating his promise to repeal and replace it. On illegal immigration, he said that “as we speak today, immigration officers are finding gang members, drug dealers and criminal aliens and throwing them the hell out.” \nHe promised changes to the welfare system, saying, “It’s time for all Americans to get off welfare and get back to work,” adding that: “You’re going to love it.” \nWhile conservatives aren’t always in sync with Trump’s views, they’re happy to have a scrapper in the White House who often takes their side. \n“How good it feels to have somebody lead our country who knows how to fight,” American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp told the crowd in introducing Trump. \nTM and © Copyright 2017 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.
