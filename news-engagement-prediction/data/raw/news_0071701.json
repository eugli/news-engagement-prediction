Photo: SMH \nMr Turnbull dismissed the former prime minister's calls for a review of the renewable energy target and a cut to immigration, observing that the RET was reviewed and set by the Abbott government. \nHe defended the immigration program as a \"nation-building exercise\" and a \"question of getting the best and brightest of the world to meet the demands of our economy\". \nMr Abbott has also copped a strong rebuke from Senator Cormann, a senior conservative who backed the former prime minister in the September 2015 leadership spill. \n\"I was flabbergasted by Tony Abbott's interview last night. I was watching live from my office in Perth and there is nothing good from an interview like that. It was deliberately destructive, it was completely unhelpful, it was not designed to be helpful, it was not trying to help our cause or help our country. It was quite self-indulgent,\" Senator Cormann told Sky News. \nAfter it was also reported that Mr Abbott has not given up hope of returning to the leadership, Senator Cormann told Sky News \"I can't see any scenario in which there is a return of Tony Abbott to the leadership of the Liberal Party\". \nThe ordinarily restrained senator said Mr Abbott's latest intervention was sad and \"much of what he says is either wrong or inconsistent with what he did as prime minister\". \nMr Pyne, a senior moderate, also hit back at Mr Abbott on Friday morning, saying his policy proposals would either be a disaster or had failed the first time around. \n\"We won't be slashing spending, Tony Abbott tried that in 2014 in the budget during his leadership but of course a whole lot of zombie legislation sat in the Senate unable to be passed,\" Mr Pyne told Channel Nine's Today show. \n\"We won't be going down the track of putting a freeze on immigration for example, which Tony Abbott wants to do, because it would be catastrophic in places like the Northern Territory, Tasmania â€“ most places outside the major cities,\" he said. \nForeign Minister Julie Bishop also defended her conduct after Sky News host Andrew Bolt, in his interview with Mr Abbott, said Ms Bishop was not \"conservative, plain-speaking and loyal\" . This elicited a laugh and smile from Mr Abbott, who accused his former deputy of treachery when he lost the top job. \n- with Latika Bourke", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-24T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-24T01:20:02.320+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
