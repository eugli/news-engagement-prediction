It's then topped off with pizza sauce -- which the box proudly proclaims comes from Californian tomatoes -- pineapple, mozzarella, \"chicken ham\" and cheese sauce.\nAfter appearing in Japan last year , the Chizza has come to my home of Singapore. To celebrate, I decided to try it for lunch. \nAs the promo picture may indicate, the Chizza isn't the most pleasant sight. You probably won't be prepared for the smell that wafts your way, a combination of old oil and faint spice. But how was it to eat?\nEach bite of the Chizza showed me regret does indeed have a taste. \nThe sauce is incredibly sweet and has that processed tomato sauce taste to it. Chucking a handful of super sweet pineapple chunks on top does not help. Then there's the \"chicken ham\", which of course is a misnomer since chicken cannot be made into real ham. Rather, this creation of mad science is flattened chicken mystery-meat that's altered to look and taste like ham slices. \n10 10 utterly weird snack foods to satiate your kookiest cravings The actual base is in essence a giant KFC chicken fillet that's been pounded flat. It's the oily, salty, crunchy chicken that by now you've probably come to either love or despise. \nBy the time you finish, you'll question your existence and will possibly need counselling. Sadly, the Chizza is not a winner. \nKFC has previously dabbled in the chicken dark arts, having made KFC-scented sunscreen last year . It's not just The Colonel who's tried to reinvent the fast food wheel, with Burger King Japan debuting the red samurai burger from hell in 2016 . \nThe Chizza is in Singapore for a limited time, but there's no news yet as to whether KFC will bring it to other nations. \nBatteries Not Included : The CNET team shares experiences that remind us why tech stuff is cool. \nLife, Disrupted : In Europe, millions of refugees are still searching for a safe place to settle.
