GETTY Sean was taken to the new Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow \nHowever, brain scans have shown “significant damage” and he is left with lifelong health complications including the loss of mobility and vision. \nDespite the ongoing battle, he has already confounded doctors with his progress and is begging to be allowed home. \nBut unless her family find the cash to make renovations to suit his needs, he is unlikely to be given even a day pass out of hospital. \nAunt Kerry Gallagher said North Lanarkshire Council had indicated the family may not be eligible for financial assistance and even suggested the best option might be to sell up and move into a council property adapted for Sean. \nThe 30-year-old added: “It does not look as if Jacqueline will get any social funding for the work but we don’t want her to lose her home. She’s worked hard for it. That’s why I’ve launched a JustGiving fundraising campaign to help her as much as we can. \n“My sister has been through hell and it is not quite over yet. NC Sean is left with lifelong health complications including the loss of mobility and vision \n“For Sean to come home, the downstairs will need to be reworked. We’ll need a wet room for him - the estimate for that is £15,000 - and then make space for a bedroom by knocking off a bit of the kitchen. \n“He is a teenage boy, we can’t have him camping in the living room. So he’ll have his own room. We reckon that will cost in the region of £5,000, so we are aiming to raise £20,000 all in.” \nMs Gallagher, who works with the mental health charity SAMH, admitted her nephew was not ready for discharge yet but said he was getting closer by the day. \nShe explained: “Jacqueline is with him every day and he is improving on a daily basis. \n“He has no sight but he hears well and is regaining his speech. It is still quite hesitant but it is clear he is getting bored and wants out. \n“But he has lost his mobility and it is unlikely he’ll gain it again so he is in a wheelchair. He used to play football a lot and he’ll now have to get used to his situation both physically and mentally. \n“His recovery has confounded everyone. He’s gone from fighting for his life with all manner of tubes attached to him to breathing independently and is just an incredible young man. \n“We all want what is best for him and with the changes to his house, he could be allowed a day pass home within a couple of months and then come back permanently once the doctors are happy for him to do so.” \nShe explained Sean was an only child who had lost his father when he was still quite young. 10 foods to prevent heart disease Mon, August 15, 2016", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-26T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-26T02:08:58.490+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
