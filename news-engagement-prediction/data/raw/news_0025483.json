Mengersen has been charged with petite larceny.\nMengersen had apparently switched over to Mickey once Elmo got a bad rap a few years ago.\nHe told Newsday four years ago that he changed his costume to the more squeaky clean Mickey Mouse after a number of other characters, including Elmo, were arrested.\nPolice have had their hands full over the years with children's characters in NYC tourist spots. Another Times Square character is seen roaming the streets for tips\nMengersen's arrest is the latest in a long line of troublemaking children's characters who populate the city's tourist spots.\nIn February 2016, Brooklyn actor Casey Braxton, 36, filed a $100 million lawsuit against the city after being arrested three times while dressed as different characters, the latest an arrest for aggressive panhandling while dressed as a Star Wars stormtrooper, reported the New York Daily News .\nIn March of last year, a Times Square Spider-Man allegedly got into a brawl with a couple who refused to tip him. Another Times Square Spider-Man, Junior Bishop, 26, has been arrested at least three times.", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/arrested-times-square-character-files-100m-suit-nyc-article-1.2535390", "http://nypost.com/2017/02/13/mickey-mouse-busted-for-conning-times-square-tourist/", "http://www.newsday.com/news/new-york/after-times-square-arrest-costumed-performers-say-they-re-not-all-troublemakers-1.5033609"], "published": "2017-02-14T01:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T04:59:04.707+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
