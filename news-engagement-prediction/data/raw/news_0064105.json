Where else can you find a vintage Roland synthesizer in working condition just laying around, begging to be picked up and used on a space-age R&B groove? \n\"I wrote 'Mess It Up' in a basement in Green Point, Brooklyn with Roger Kleinman, Zach Seman and Theo Seman (A$AP Rocky, Whethan ) last summer,” independent producer Lucas Nord says. “It started off with us playing around with a beat up Roland SH-101 synth Roger had found on the sidewalk that day. It was broken and barely worked, but it had this weird pitch and wobbly sound that became the bass sample for the track.” \n“Mess It Up” carries a truly vintage feel. There's something so rich and warm about the composition, and those early '80s synths play a huge role. The swinging beat and slightly off mark deliver of organ sounds gives it an overall future bass swagger in the best kind of way, while the lyrics tell the story of a man who can't keep his own swag in line. \n“I wrote the lyrics for the song about a recent break up I had with a girl and how I repeatedly fuck up relationships,” Nord says. “I can be somewhat selfish and spend all my time and energy on music rather than dating relationships. Despite being an absent partner, I still crave their attention, which never works out well in the end.” ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T07:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:19:25.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
