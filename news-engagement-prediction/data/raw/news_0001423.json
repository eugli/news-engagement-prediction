Montini. \nSchool \"choice\" is a scam.\nIt’s a con.\nIt’s a euphemism used by lawmakers who want to gut the state’s public school system and hand over taxpayer money to affluent families .\nLeading the charge in this legislative session is Republican Sen. Debbie Lesko. She introduced Senate Bill 1431, which would make all Arizona families eligible for Empowerment Scholarship Accounts . Essentially, these are vouchers that for most families would amount to about $5,000.\nIn a statement Lesko said, “This allows parents to use it for the best education their child can get. The traditional district schools oppose ESAs, just like they have opposed charter schools for two decades. They don't want the competition. Luckily, our Governor and Republicans in the Legislature don't focus on protecting a monopoly, but instead on what is best for the child.\"\nA monopoly?\nWhy ESAs are a big rip-off Will state lawmakers take another bite out of the public school budget?   (Photo: Pat Shannahan, AZR) \nPublic education is not a monopoly. It’s a responsibility. One that the Republicans who control the Legislature, like Lesko, have failed to honor. For years the Legislature refused to fund public schools to the level voters demanded in a statewide vote. For years Arizona teachers have had to live on salaries well below what is received by peers in other states and well below their value to our state.\nThe Empowerment Scholarship Account (ESA) program began as a way to help children with disabilities, foster kids and some others. That's a good thing.\nNow, however, it’s being used as a ruse by lawmakers to siphon cash out of public schools by offering the money to all families.\nWhy is that a scam and a rip-off?\nDATABASE: Search for ESA awards in your district \nAfter all, Gov. Doug Ducey, a supporter of ESAs has said, “What I want a parent to be able to do is send a child to the school of their choice.”\nBut could you?\nReally good private schools are expensive.\nIf Lesko’s bill passes I wouldn’t be surprised to see a raft of second-rate \"private\" schools pop up, hoping to cash in on the state giveaway while offering a less than stellar education.\n$5,000 won't go far at these schools As I said, the really good schools are expensive. For example, Gov. Ducey sent his boys to Brophy College Preparatory. If Lesko’s bill passes any parent can get $5,000 in taxpayer money to send a kid there. Except Brophy (like most really good private schools) will set you back $15,000 a year or more. So unless you can afford the extra ten grand per year the voucher is worthless.\nHowever, if you are already wealthy enough to afford such a school the state will give you $5,000 that you don’t need.\nThat’s not choice.\nIt’s more like theft.\nIt’s the Legislature acting -- again -- like Robin Hood in reverse. Stealing from the poor to give to the rich.\nAZCENTRAL\nMy Turn: School vouchers don't always save money (or offer real choice)\nAZCENTRAL\nSchool choice saves - not costs - Arizona cash: Column", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T03:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T01:03:18.437+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
