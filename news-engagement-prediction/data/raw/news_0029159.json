I wish I had no money most days. I thought it would make things ten times better but it's made things ten times worse. I have material things but apart from that my life is empty. What is my purpose in life?' She claims to be suffering from stress and faces a charge of drink-driving after being arrested at a drive-thru McDonald's. Where else? On reading her tale of woe, my first inclination was to file it under: Oh dear, how sad, never mind. But then my compassionate nature kicked in and I thought, she's only a kid. Jane Park was 17 when she scooped £1million with the first ticket she had ever bought in 2013 That was until I discovered that instead of putting it all down to experience and getting on with her life, Jane has decided to blame someone else for her thoroughly miserable existence. She says she is planning to sue Camelot for selling her the winning ticket in the first place, complaining that she was far too young and the legal age for playing the Lottery should be raised to 18. Of course, there's never any accounting for dopey birds. But wouldn't it be refreshing if for once, just once, someone took responsibility for their own plight. That's not the modern way. These days anyone dissatisfied with their lot automatically hires a lawyer and looks for someone else to carry the can. Ms Park, who now owns two properties and calls herself a developer, said: 'I thought it would make it ten times better but it's made it ten times worse' As those no-win, no-fee Blame Direct adverts on daytime TV promise: you could be entitled to com-pen-say-shun. The trouble with the Lottery has always been the idea it fosters that you can become rich without any effort. It goes hand in glove with the ghastly cult of celebrity, which encourages young women to pose topless on the internet in the hope that they, too, will become as famous as gruesome slappers like the Kardashians. Feminism was supposed to empower women, to give them control over their own lives. Instead, along with our modern culture of entitlement and victimhood, it has infantilised many of them Jane Park is the architect of her own misfortune. No one forced her to buy a Lottery ticket, nor fritter her winnings on surgical enhancement and sunshine holidays. She could have ticked the box marked 'no publicity' and no one would have been any the wiser. The money could have set her up for life. It's not Camelot's fault she spent it unwisely. The company employs investment advisers and financial planners to help winners manage their windfall. She was offered support and counselling, yet chose to ignore Camelot's advice. But we now live in a society where everyone is encouraged to consider themselves a 'victim' — even a woman who becomes a millionaire overnight. So it's no wonder that when her life doesn't turn out to be a bed of roses, as a result of her own folly, she feels entitled to seek redress elsewhere. There was a further appalling example of this self-pitying trait last week, involving another self-styled 'property developer'. Maria Mills, 51, had her monthly maintenance payments increased by almost a third. After the verdict, she found herself vilified by men and women alike Fifteen years ago, Maria Mills divorced her husband Graham. She walked away from the marriage with a £230,000 settlement, which she invested in a house in Surrey, and a monthly allowance of £1,100. Subsequently, she sold that property and bought a couple of flats in South London. Somehow, she's ended up potless. It takes a special kind of genius to lose money in the overheated London property market. Instead of facing up to her losses, Mrs Mills apparently decided that her debts were the fault of her ex-husband, whom she divorced in 2002. Incredibly, the Court of Appeal agreed with her and ordered Graham Mills to increase her alimony to £1,441 a month. Why the hell should he have to pick up the tab for his ex-wife's foolish investments? Any more than Camelot should be held responsible for Jane Park's woes? Feminism was supposed to empower women, to give them control over their own lives. Instead, along with our modern culture of entitlement and victimhood, it has infantilised many of them. So much so that when something goes wrong in their lives, there's always someone else to blame — the Lottery company, an ex-husband, you name it. And shamefully, the system indulges them. Jane Park wants her day in court. She should be told to take responsibility for her own actions. She wanted to be a millionaire. She made the decision to buy the ticket, she chose how to spend the money. She should grow up and learn to live with the consequences. We are always told that 'refugees' from the Middle East and elsewhere bring valuable skills with them. Now the Swedish city of Gothenburg has decided to capitalise on this wealth of expertise by building a camel park. The man behind the project, Geza Nagy, said migrants from the Middle East and Somalia who have settled in Sweden have 'extensive knowledge' of camels, which should be exploited. It is hoped the camel park will become a tourist attraction. Visitors will be able to stroke the animals and ride on them. Just wait until this exciting initiative spreads to Britain. We could have refugees giving camel rides along London's Embankment, utilising the empty cycle lane. Every city could replace taxis and buses with camel trains, working for days on one hump of water, cutting harmful diesel emissions at a stroke. We've got thousands of unemployed camel jockeys in Britain. Let's put them to good use. One minute, Mother Theresa is urging our Nato partners in Europe to spend more money on defence. The next we learn that the British Army is offering to let soldiers work a three-day week with a guarantee that they never have to go to war. The MoD has announced a pilot scheme aimed at making service in the Armed Forces more family-friendly, including the right to 'opt out' of frontline duties. We already have dustmen who don't empty the dustbins and doctors who refuse to work evenings and weekends. So why not non-combatant soldiers? The scheme will even be extended to members of the SAS and the Royal Marines. Admittedly, all branches of the Armed Services are having recruitment problems. That's largely because successive governments have cut spending to the bone and made a military career an increasingly unattractive option. The knowledge that anyone on active service could, until now, be pursued by cynical lawyers for bogus 'war crimes' hardly helped morale. Life in the services can be tough on families, but that's always been the reality. If the MoD wants to improve things, it could start by tackling the disgraceful condition of so many married quarters. But where will this pilot scheme end? Will all barracks have to have nappy-changing stations? Will there be 'Bring your daughter to work' days, with toddlers crawling all over tanks and handling live ammunition? Will female recruits be allowed to breastfeed in foxholes? All this smacks of government by gimmick and fails to address the real problems of underspending on defence and lack of genuine support for the Armed Forces. Gordon Brown bequeathed the Navy two aircraft carriers but didn't provide the money to equip them with any planes. The MoD wastes millions on bungled contracts. We also learned at the weekend that because of a recruitment crisis, the Navy is encouraging retired sailors over 60 to re-enlist. I've heard of Dad's Army. Now we've got Dad's Navy, too. Don't panic! Shame on Shami Corbyn stooge Shami Chakrabarti, recently elevated to the Lords, has been sticking up for crooked lawyer Phil Shyster, struck off for harvesting false claims against British soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. Shami says that fellow 'human rights' activist Shyster 'did very good work before losing his way'. By the same token, Jimmy Savile 'did good work' for charity before he lost his way, too, and raped hundreds of women and children. Shami Chakrabarti, recently elevated to the Lords, has been sticking up for crooked lawyer Phil Shyster Britain is suffering dozens of cyber-attacks every day from countries such as Russia. They're even hacking into 'smart' domestic appliances including fridges and kettles. Call me old-fashioned, but why would anyone want to connect a kettle to the internet? Sorry, love, I would make you a cup of tea but I've forgotten the password.
