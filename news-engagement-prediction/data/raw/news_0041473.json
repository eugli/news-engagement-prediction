GRANT MATTHEW/Fairfax NZ \nTheodore Anderson has no bad feelings towards a driver who crashed into him pinning him between her car and a supermarket window on Saturday. \n\"Once I heard that accelerator, I just looked up but bang it was too late.\" \nREAD MORE * Pedestrian hit, pinned up against supermarket in New Plymouth \nA bollard slowed the car's progress but couldn't stop it mounting the footpath and throwing the 45-year-old up over the bonnet before crashing into the front of the store. \n\"That sort of slowed the car down a bit, but it wasn't enough to stop it, if it wasn't there it would have been more than stopping at the window. \n\"It threw me up on top of the bonnet and my whole body had just slammed into the windscreen.\" \nAnderson, who suffered a cut to his left calf just below the knee and bruising to his buttocks, said he was lucky his leg wasn't trapped and thanked the people who quickly arrived to help. \n\"It was like getting a really good boot up the bum. \n\"Everyone who was there, they were just awesome. It was an awesome response.\" \nHe said he just lay on the car's bonnet waiting for paramedics and firefighters to arrive. \n\"Everything was just flying through my mind.\" \nAnderson's wife Paula was at the gym training for an Iron Maori event when she got the phone call. \n\"My response was, are you serious? Really you kind of see that stuff on TV not at Countdown,\" she said. \nThe scaffolder from Bell Block said he ended up in the same ambulance as the elderly woman who hit him and he had no hard feelings towards her. \n\"We had a good conversation in the ambulance, I just said 'don't worry I'm still here'. \n\"I just hope that the lady is feeling alright, it was a simple mistake and it could've happened to anyone.\" \nAnderson spent about five hours at Taranaki Base Hospital having glass removed from the cut on his leg. \nHe had been convinced to buy a Lotto ticket on his way home, by family and friends, so he felt compelled to return to the scene of the crash and bought it from Countdown. \nOn Sunday he hadn't checked to see if the ticket was a winner. \nPolice inquiries into the cause of the crash are ongoing. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T10:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T05:43:08.148+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
