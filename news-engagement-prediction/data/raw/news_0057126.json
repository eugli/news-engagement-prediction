Cockle, who did not attend the hearing, expressed his remorse and apologised in a written statement presented by the Police Federation. The hearing at Ipswich Crown Court was told he had also failed to report his find to the Norfolk coroner who would have considered if it was treasure trove. The coins which he sold in three batches over 14 months are believed to have been part of a larger hoard. Merovingian Tremissis coins were made in Gaul, now France, are said to be very rare in the UK with only around 100 of them found in modern times Similar gold coins were found in the same field in west Norfolk by another metal detecting fan who also had permission to be on the land. Unlike Cockle however, the other man reported his find to the authorities, enabling it to be declared as treasure trove. THE MEROVINGIAN DYNASTY The Merovingians were a powerful Frankish dynasty, which exercised control much of modern-day France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and the Low Countries. During the Early Middle Ages, the Merovingian kingdoms were arguably the most powerful and most important polities to emerge after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. Merovingian Tremissis coins were made in Gaul, now France, and other low countries of Europe and are said to be very rare in the UK with only around 100 of them found in modern times. According to reports, the two finds together potentially made it the largest ever hoard of the type of coins ever found in the UK. The offence happened when Cockle was living in Wereham near Downham Market, Norfolk. He is now living in Leigh, Lancashire. Cockle initially denied stealing, but changed his plea to guilty on the day his trial was due to start. Judge Rupert Overbury adjourned sentencing until March 8 for a pre-sentence report, but told the officer that he was considering giving him a suspended prison sentence. The judge added that there was a rigid process to be followed if treasure was found. But he said that Cockle had sold the coins in batches to the dealer on the basis that he legitimately owned them. Cockle also denied three charges of converting criminal property. Prosecutors said that they would not proceed with the charges. A Norfolk Police spokeswoman said Cockle had been suspended since being charged in May 2016. The spokeswoman said he was 'in breach of a contract he had signed with the landowner' to share the proceeds of any find. She added: 'The investigation was launched after the Norfolk and Suffolk Anti-Corruption Unit received information from a member of the public and Cockle was arrested in November 2015.'
