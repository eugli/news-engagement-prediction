The hotel has hosted more political events than Trump has had bad hair days. For all three hotels, they naturally extend the same hospitality and courtesy to regular guests that a past or present president would receive. President Trump is scheduled to attend the National Prayer Breakfast at the Washington Hilton on Thursday – marking the first time he will visit the hotel as 45th president. But what does it take to host a president? Security The Washington Hilton excels in presidential security – and even more so since the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981, which happened as the president was leaving the hotel. (This little blip didn't stop Reagan from returning to the hotel – he came back seven months later.) President Clinton with staff at the Washington Hilton. He was given a hotel name badge (pictured) because he visited so often Working with state security, the Washington Hilton has since developed intricate and highly sophisticated techniques and methods for keeping the Commander in Chief safe. Outside the hotel there is what looks to the casual eye like an open car port. But it is no secret that this structure is a bullet-and-bomb-proof presidential bunker where 'the beast' will pull up, triggering roller shutters that will swiftly descend before anyone exits the vehicle. Once the shutters are down and the president has alighted, he makes his way through the gold double doors into a special section of the hotel that is kept secured at all times, even when a visit is not taking place. The special holding area for the president includes a small sitting room, lavatory (which only a president or their spouse may use) and several other 'hidden' rooms, which neither the White House nor the hotel are willing to name. President Barack Obama in 2009 at the MTV Youth Ball at the Washington Hilton Former president George W Bush is seen here at his inaugural ball at the Washington Hilton in 2005 The Washington Hilton's gigantic ballroom was filled for George W Bush's ball Ronald Reagan and Nancy wave cheerily in 1981 at his inaugural ball at the Washington Hilton When ready to enter the international ballroom, the president exits the special holding area via the presidents' walk, which is lined with the official portraits of each president and their first lady (or 'first hostess', as is the term when a president is not married and opts for his daughter or niece to fulfil the role). As with the Waldorf Astoria in New York, the Capital Hilton has a special auto-lift, enabling the presidential car to arrive discreetly on the second floor for the Presidential ballroom (FDR had polio and was unable to walk – something that was, more or less, kept hidden from the American people for years). Catering It surprised me to hear from Sinead Fitzpatrick, the Assistant Director of Catering at the Washington Hilton, that the POTUS and FLOTUS teams are not strictly part of the menu planning process for events at the hotel but the menus are cleared with the White House about a week in advance. The Obamas were always very happy to eat whatever they were served although Michelle Obama always ate in moderation and often pushed any pasta dishes to one side or instead was served a fillet of grilled salmon. When ready to enter the international ballroom at the Washington Hilton, the president exits the special holding area via the presidents' walk (pictured), which is lined with the official portraits of each president and their first lady TRUMP'S BALLROOM BATTLE The New York Hilton Midtown 's grand ballroom was President Trump's choice to host his election night party… or wake, as it may have been had the outcome been different. But Trump's campaign chose the 1,931-bedroom, centrally located hotel not because of any political allegiances between Hilton and Trump (far from it), but because his own ballroom at Trump International wasn't big enough. Size envy, Mr President? 'President Clinton had a penchant for caffeine free Diet Coke', says Karen Feketis, the Washington Hilton's Director of Catering, 'so all the hotels naturally had a healthy supply to hand whenever he visited.' One of the president's security detail would randomly select a few cans on the day for Clinton to drink. Service Being America, there's no butler or silver service at table, Thomas O'Doherty the Director of Evets and Catering at Washington Hilton tells me. It's all very democratic and done as per plated service (where the food arrives on the plate already portioned up and ready-to-eat), although the president and the first lady get served first, of course. Presidents at these hotels get used to being waited on by the same faces – experienced hands are preferred over new talent, although if you stick around long enough you may find yourself being promoted to serving the head table. Your face may become so familiar to a president as a server your absence may get noticed if you are unable to serve one day. Obama once noticed that a long-standing banquet captain was absent and enquired as to how they were. Housekeeping Washington Hilton prides itself on attention to detail for each president and commissions monogrammed handtowels for each new president to go inside the special loo. I imagine if the hotel wishes to ingratiate itself to the new incumbent then the new set will have been monogrammed in gold. The presidential rotunda in the special bunker is one of the few non-government buildings to be allowed to display the presidential seal, although it gets covered when the president is not visiting. An Extension to The White House Amazing view: William Hanson at the top of the Hay-Adams with the world's most famous house in the background Like with The Goring in London, the Hay-Adams provides a similar, unofficial, service to The White House, often hosting diplomats and entourages who can't all stay at Blair House, which is The White House's official guesthouse. In 2009, the hotel played host to the Obamas in the run-up to President Obama's first inauguration. George W Bush had, oddly, broken with tradition and given Blair House to other guests like then Australian Prime Minister John Howard and various ambassadors. Sports and gym equipment from Capital Hilton's health club, which is only 0.2 miles up 16th Street NW from the Hay-Adams, was leant to the hotel for the Obama's use, Kristin Adderson, the Assistant Director of Marketing at Capital Hilton revealed. The Capital Hilton has hosted every US president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt to Obama and has held official presidential inaugural balls for presidents George W Bush, Reagan, Johnson, Nixon, Kennedy and Eisenhower Although no sitting president has stayed at any of these hotels (why would they when their house is just down the block), the presidential suite at Capital Hilton was used by Bill Clinton to interview Al Gore ahead of Clinton adding Gore's name to his 1993 campaign ticket. Part of the staff Judit Nikolov, Assistant Manager of Events, remembers the actions of a quick thinking former colleague: Bill Clinton visited the Washington Hilton so often during his presidency, the then Director of Human Resources created a hotel name badge for him as a gift for when he stepped down from office. Many years later, when Clinton came back for an event at the hotel, he produced the name badge to show the manager, asking, 'Is this thing still good here?'
