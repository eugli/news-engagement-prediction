More According to the leaked emails, which David’s people claim have been doctored, the Quote: : “Katherine Jenkins OBE for what? Singing at the rugby and going to see the troops plus taking coke. F***ing joke”.\nHowever, Katherine’s team have now hit back at David’s outrage and defended the 36-year-old star’s right to the award, which she received in the 2014 New Year Honours.\nHer manager, Professor Jonathan Shalit, told The Sun: “I say Katherine was awarded an OBE for her services to music and charity.\nView photos\nThe singer was honoured in 2014. More “With regards to the taking of coke which Katherine has courageously publicly admitted with great honesty — this was when she was in her early 20s still studying, over a decade before she was awarded her OBE and started her recording career.\n“At the age of 23 she signed the largest record deal in UK classical history with Decca.\n“She went on to become the world’s most prolific crossover artist selling over ten million CDs, and having platinum albums worldwide.\n“She has performed for Presidents and Royalty including at Westminster Cathedral in honour of Pope John Paul II’s Silver Jubilee and Her Majesty the Queen’s 90th Birthday celebrations at Windsor Castle.”\nView photos\nDavid claims the emails have been ‘doctored’. More Katherine herself has remained publicly silent on David’s comments.\nAs well as slamming the singer, Beckham’s leaked emails to PR chief Simon Oliveira also appeared to imply that the star’s extensive charity work for UNICEF was merely his attempt to get a knighthood.\nOne message branded the Honours Committee “unappreciative c***s” and he also seethed “unless it’s a knighthood f*** off.”\nView photos\nThe star’s emails have been defended by UNICEF. More A spokesman for the star has insisted that the emails were “doctored” by hackers, with sources also saying that Beckham understandably “regrets” sending the messages to his PR in “the heat of the moment”.\nNeither David or his wife, Victoria, have publicly commented on the scandal.", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NzpbrIoh215lQTn3WfCUtA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDg3/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a3b60f4686fac6f2747194b1274d78df);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qEFH0tO8t7AoUOrKYb8jbQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjM0O2g9NDI1/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/fd6e2ce1458687b571f20a0c7c0a3051", "https://yhoo.it/2kfejSP&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.l6.Br3E5XEjNByl.M25gA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NjM4/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/7fb7e619076f5c2c69d0fd39d947fc0b);", "https://yhoo.it/2kfejSP", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/s5_YEttzdufCGNd7J1Xcbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDg2/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/635d517c0da34c3441843cb83a874463);", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.l6.Br3E5XEjNByl.M25gA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NjM4/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/7fb7e619076f5c2c69d0fd39d947fc0b", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/qEFH0tO8t7AoUOrKYb8jbQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjM0O2g9NDI1/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/fd6e2ce1458687b571f20a0c7c0a3051);", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/s5_YEttzdufCGNd7J1Xcbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDg2/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/635d517c0da34c3441843cb83a874463", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/NzpbrIoh215lQTn3WfCUtA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NDg3/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/a3b60f4686fac6f2747194b1274d78df"], "published": "2017-02-06T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T18:24:10.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
