What made this talented young woman turn to murder? Some believe it was the thrill, other's say it was so she could meet up with her boyfriend who also worked at the hospital. Gilbert's Childhood Years \nKristen Heather Strickland was born November 13, 1967, to parents Richard and Claudia Strickland. She was the oldest of the couples two daughters in what appeared to be a well-adjusted home. The family moved from Fall River to Groton, Massachusetts and Kristen lived out her preteen years without any significant problems. A Young Liar \nAs Kristen grew older her appearance became more refined and she had a naturally sophisticated air that her friends admired. She was smart and pretty, but had one major flaw - she was a chronic liar . She told her friends that she was a distant relative to Lizzie Borden and also managed to convince her college roommates that her mother was an abusive drunk. Neither tale was true, but lying came so naturally to Kristen, it was hard to know what was the truth. \nThe more people came to know Kristen, the more they seemed to edge away from the friendship. One friend recounted how Kristin showed up in a blouse which her friend had discovered missing from her closet. When questioned, Kristin insisted the blouse was her own. Former boyfriends described Kristin as strange and controlling. For attention, she would fake suicide or when angry she would tamper with the boys' cars or physically attack them , scratching them with her nails. Marriage \nIn 1988 Kristen earned her degree as a registered nurse from Greenfield Community College. She also married Glenn Gilbert, who she met at Hampton Beach, New Hampshire. By March 1989 she landed a job at the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Northampton, Massachusetts, and the young couple bought a home and settled into their new life. The Office Social Butterfly: \nTo fellow workers, Kristen seemed competent and committed to her job. She was the type of coworker who would remember birthdays, organize gift exchanges during the holidays and seemed the social butterfly of the C Ward where she worked. Her superiors rated her nursing as \" highly skillful \" and noted how well she reacted during medical emergencies. All in all, things during this span of Kristen's life were good, or so it appeared. \nIn late 1990 the Gilbert's had their first child, a baby boy. After returning from maternity leave, Kristin switched to the 4 p.m. until midnight shift and almost immediately strange things began to happen. Patients began dying during her shift, tripling the Medical Center's rate of deaths over the previous three years. During each incident, Kristen's calm competent nursing skills shined, and she won the admiration of her fellow workers. The Perrault Affair \nAfter the Gilbert's second child was born in 1993, the couple's marriage seemed to falter. Kristen was developing a friendship with James Perrault, a newly hired VA Hospital security guard. He worked from 3 p.m. until 11 p.m. and the two often went to have drinks with other workers at the end of their shifts. Perrault was also called anytime there was a medical emergency on Ward C. It was during such emergencies that Kristen would impress Perrault with her exceptional nursing skills. \nIn the fall of 1994, the relationship between Kristen and Perrault moved from friendship to intimacy. Glenn, Kristen's husband, began to notice the food Kristen served him had an odd taste to it. Although nothing was ever proven, Glenn Gilbert became convinced his wife was trying to kill him, telling friends she wanted him dead by Thanksgiving. When Perrault presented Kristen with the ultimatum to leave Glen, or end their relationship, Kristen promptly told Glen she was leaving. Out On Her Own \nAt the first of December, Kristen left her husband and kids and moved into her own apartment and she and Perrault's relationship was in full bloom. Things were not as merry at the VA Hospital. A lot of patients were dying and Kristen's coworkers began to whisper about the deaths always occurring on Kristen's shift. Although many of the patients who died were in serious condition and old, there were also patients who, although sick, had no history of heart problems, yet were dying of cardiac arrest. \nMonths went by with business as usual at the hospital. The whispers about Kristen continued, but many chose not to believe she would be involved in something as sinister as killing the patients . Others were not so trusting and began to monitor drugs that could cause cardiac arrest. One such drug, epinephrine, kept coming up missing. Unofficially, Ward C was under a close eye of a handful of the nurses assigned to it. \"If My Patient Dies, Can I Get Off Early?\" \nIn December 1994, Kristen offered a vial of epinephrine to a fellow nurse who suffered from asthma. This left little doubt as to who was responsible for the missing vials of the drug from the locked cabinet. But perhaps the event which most raised suspicion occurred on February 2, 1996, when Gilbert, anxious to leave work to meet Perrault, asked her supervisor if she could leave work early if her patient in ICU died. She was told yes and within hours the patient was dead from cardiac arrest. \nOn February 15, an AIDS patient, who was being treated with antibiotics, suddenly passed out after Kristen had flushed his intravenous lines and the nurses on Ward C finally decided to report their suspicions to their superiors. It did not take federal investigators long to figure out the common thread to many of the deaths occurring on Ward C, was Kristen Gilbert. In the seven years she worked at the VA Hospital, 350 deaths had occurred during her shift, statistically impossible to attribute to coincidence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-23T18:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-23T20:16:12.934+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
