Makeup artists and beauty bloggers do it all the time. However, I never thought to use the Topshop Chameleon Glow in Shuffle the Cards on my cheekbones until recently. I've had the duo chrome gold eye shadow, which shifts to red when the light hits it, in my makeup bag for over a year. After seeing the blinding results that Jaclyn Hill got after using a shade from her upcoming eye shadow palette as a highlighter, I was convinced to try it out with some that I already own. That's where the Topshop Chameleon Glow comes in. After brushing the golden red shade onto my lids, I made a game-time decision and swept it atop my cheekbones, too. I already had the Glossier Moonstone Haloscope on , but the creamy stick almost acted as a primer. Together, my skin looked holographic yet radiant. I've used a lot of highlighters, but I've never found one like this. The color is almost like the missing gold shade from the Kat Von D Alchemist Holographic Palette .
