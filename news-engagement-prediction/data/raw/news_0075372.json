Kane had a forgettable Euro 2016 Credit: EPA \nW ithout that mean side it's almost assumed he will be mentally weak, and will struggle to bounce back from the droughts that come around at some stage each year - and are highlighted at every opportunity by his detractors. \nHe took seven games to score his first goal of the 2015/16 season, while he was out of sorts either side of a desperately disappointing Euro 2016 campaign. Even Roy Hodgson's decision to have Kane take corners in France was another reason to take aim at the player. \nBut he just seems to bounce back every time, despite constant questions from all directions. And when he is on a hot streak he is absolutely lethal. \nHe has 13 goals in his last 12 games, having already hit nine in nine earlier this season. Both of those come after a seven-week layoff with an ankle injury which followed shortly after the Euros. During the time he was out there were plenty of questions about how quickly he would be able to rediscover form. He scored at Arsenal on his return , got three in two against West Ham and Monaco immediately afterwards. Premier League and EFL Cup final team of the week \nM anager Mauricio Pochettino has always believed in the the player's self-confidence, saying in November 2015: \"When we arrived he [Kane] was behind Soldado and Adebayor. We gave him the tools and he knew how to use them. He has a tremendous talent and mental strength. It is crucial.\" \nHe plays just about every game and further presumptions are made that he will be burn out given how much Pochettino asks of his players, but Kane will always vehemently deny any part fatigue might play. His record in the face of criticism gives little reason to believe he finds his workload troubling. \nSince the start of the 2014/15 season, during which Kane became Spurs' starting centre forward, Kane has scored more Premier League goals than any other player, with 63 in 93 games. \nW ith a goal every 123 minutes, he has also netted more frequently than any other player to score at least 15 goals in that time except Sergio Aguero, who was already an established world class striker when Kane was still proving himself, and has been playing in a more dominant side, too. \nThose two have the most hat-tricks in that time, with four each, though the claim that Kane is a flat-track bully is misplaced, given Arsenal and Chelsea are among the teams he scored against most. \nWith Sunday's treble against Stoke taking him into triple figures for career goals, he \"has the profile to be a legend\" at Tottenham, according to his manager. Only five players had more Premier League goals than Kane at the point of 24, and the Spurs and England forward has five months to go before he reaches that birthday. \nT he next worry may be that he follows the likes of Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Chris Sutton in peaking too early, but that is exactly the sort of challenge to which Kane will respond. \nH is latest display encapsulated everything so brilliant about Kane: clinical finishing, an ability to score all types of goals and that unbeatable knack of being in the right place at all the right times. \nIt won't matter to Kane if doubts start to creep in next time he misses a few chances. His unerring confidence in his own ability and the mental strength to sideline any self doubt is commendable, and leaves his with all the tools and more to go on to become a Premier League great.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-27T19:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-27T14:59:31.087+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
