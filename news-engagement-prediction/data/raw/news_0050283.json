After hearing about their efforts just three weeks ago, lawyer Ben Conoley started a GoFundMe page to lend a hand. \nREAD MORE: ‘Remarkable’ response to fundraising efforts for new Fredericton mosque \nSince then, hundreds of people have contributed and $30,000 has been raised. The fundraiser also caught the eye of Caribbean Flavas restaurant owner Chef Naz. \nNaz, an immigrant himself, said he knows how hard it can be to move from another country and try to establish roots in a new place. He wanted to do what he could to ease the burden of many of the mosque members. \n“We want to show love to the rest of our immigrant brothers and sisters, so we want to do a special menu for them with foods that are familiar to them, like kebbe and kebabs and things like that,” Naz said Monday. \nUntil the end of the month, the restaurant will be offering up traditional Syrian and Muslim-inspired cuisine, donating 25 per cent of the proceeds to the fundraiser for the new mosque. \nThey’re also offering 25 per cent off to customers for the rest of the month. \n“I have employed many immigrants just like myself, from Lebanon to Syria etc., so they’ve been helping us incorporate a Caribbean-vibe to these foods that they’re accustomed to at home,” Naz said. \nREAD MORE: Fredericton welcomed more Syrians per capita than other Canadian cities: multicultural association \nOne of Naz’s food suppliers has also agreed to donate fruits and vegetables. \nNaz said he hopes other businesses in the area also get on board to support their Muslim neighbours. \nWith files from Jeremy Keefe, Global News. © 2017 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
