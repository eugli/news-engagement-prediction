Watch as he sets himself in his natural slot position.\nSmile as he fights his way through that first, powerful block. Catch your breath as he strides into a beautifully crafted route. Nod as he gathers the football to his chest.\nWait, breathless, for what comes next.\nWatch in awe as he explodes into the open field. Stand and applaud as he churns his powerful legs for every extra yard his body will give him. Dance in joy as he erupts in a signature end-zone salsa.\nNow open your eyes.\nWipe away the tear, if you must.\nWe are here to say goodbye to Victor Cruz, the singular shooting star whose seven years with the Giants came to an end Monday when the franchise made the very difficult football decision to release him.\nCruz will play football somewhere next year, but nothing will ever come close to what he did here with the Giants, how he rose from the streets of Paterson, seemingly out of nowhere, to become a Super Bowl-winning, salsa-dancing sensation; how he turned MetLife Stadium into his own backyard playground and took us all along for the ride, playing this game with a combination of flair, skill, passion and ability for anyone to emulate.\nHe will be missed. And he will miss you.\nSource: Giants have released Victor Cruz\nCruz wants to stay a Giant, waiting on team brass\nArchive: Sullivan - Turning 30 doesn't faze Victor Cruz\nFive Victor Cruz moments we'll never forget\nCruz tried valiantly to put his emotions aside as the Giants’ season inched toward its inevitable conclusion, but the reminders were impossible to sidestep. From the final home game against the Lions to the final regular-season game in Washington, from one more postseason opportunity in Green Bay to the resounding disappointment of that playoff loss, Cruz was alternately stubborn and reflective, one part unwilling to contemplate a future without the Giants, one part unable to avoid it. But he was never arrogant enough to believe this couldn’t happen to him, just as was always insightful enough to appreciate how it all came together in the first place.\n“I mean, the people that have been through it understand it, but I don’t think to the average fan out there, they have no idea,” Cruz told me in a quiet conversation just two days before that home finale against Detroit. “To be chosen amongst groups of guys that have been drafted and scouted and prioritized, for you to make that big of an impact, to affect an organization, to have them keep you on the team, to start you, to believe in you, to play you, it’s not an easy thing. And to do it at home? There’s so many layers to it, so many layers, man. Because I had options. Obviously I was a free agent, you have options to go other places if other teams have an offer for you. And this team had the most receivers on the roster, but I was like, man, ‘I don’t care. I want to give home a shot and see what happens and take it from there.’ I got my opportunities and I took it from there.”\nThe Giants' Weston Richburg (70), Victor Cruz (80) and Keenan Robinson (57) celebrate a touchdown catch by Cruz in the 2016 season opener at Dallas.

Close your eyes again.\nThere’s Cruz making stoic Tom Coughlin break into a ridiculous grin, the daily training camp antics of an undrafted rookie wide receiver making the old coach gush. There’s Cruz losing what should have been his first NFL season to injury, but refusing to give in. There’s Cruz breaking the backs of the archrival Jets, an indelible 99-yard catch and TD run at the end of the 2011 season forever changing the fortunes of both franchises.\nThere’s Cruz crying in empathy for those beautiful young victims of Sandy Hook, meeting the family of his biggest fan, who would be buried in a Cruz jersey. There’s Cruz writhing on the Philadelphia turf in agony, the first in a series of debilitating injuries that would rob him of almost two full NFL seasons. There’s Cruz back on this season's opening night field in Dallas, dancing himself open long enough for Eli Manning to find him for a game-winning touchdown, the torn patellar tendon in his knee repaired, the surgery to his calf healed, the hole in his football heart filled once again.\nVictor Cruz never gave up. He never gave in. From the depths of anonymity to the height of football fame, from the pit of football injury to the summit of triumphant return, he was inspiring on the field. He was even more inspiring off it. He used his voice. He embraced his fans. He listened when others didn’t, both in a locker room where he would be voted a team captain and in a neighborhood where he would be revered as a role model.\nClose your eyes and remember it, because players, and people, like Victor Cruz don’t come around too often.\nGiants receiver Victor Cruz (80) does a salsa dance as he celebrates a touchdown against the Eagles in 2012.   (Photo: Associated press file photo) \nWhen I close my eyes, what comes to mind is not a football play or a locker room interview. It is an Albany practice field, where Cruz is standing alongside a rope, signing autographs. I happened to have my daughter with me that day, and we were making our way back to our car. She saw Cruz. Her eyes popped wide open. She broke into a sprint when he waved us over. She beamed as he signed her mini-football. But it was what he did next that truly stayed with us forever.\nWith a pat on her head, Cruz, voice full of warmth, said, “You have an awesome mom.”\nI didn’t need the compliment and I never craved the recognition. But my 8-year-old Keira loved it. She'd just met her new favorite player. She would have plenty of company.\nFor that, and for everything, I say, \"Thank you, Victor.\" Never mind being one of the best stories I ever covered. You were one of the best guys.\nAnd that is your Giant legacy.\nE-mail: sullivan@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-14T05:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T08:18:00.178+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
