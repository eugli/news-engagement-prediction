Well, people talk. Let the dice fall where it may.” ADVERTISEMENT \nIn a video she posted on her Facebook page on Wednesday, Lopez explained she wasn’t making accusations but was just repeating what she heard from the grapevine. \n“I have heard—you know how people talk—that there was a kitty where every congressman was offered P50 million if they voted against me. That’s just what I heard. It’s tsismis, there’s no evidence, there’s no anything. And I said that casually. It’s not a news bit,” Lopez said. \n“It’s just tsismis, and they turned tsismis into a headline,” Lopez said, reacting to the reports of her statement.
