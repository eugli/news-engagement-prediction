I have no idea,” Trump said. \n“He’s a killer, though,” O’Reilly interjected. \n“Putin’s a killer.” \nTrump nodded and thought for a moment, then replied, “A lot of killers, we got a lot of killers. What, you think our country’s so innocent?” President Trump discussed Vladimir Putin with Bill O'Reilly in the much-publicized interview. (Fox News) \nThe Kremlin made no comment about Trump's remarks. \nRussia has aided Syrian President Bashar Assad during Syria’s civil war, and a United Nations report last year said Russia had killed more than 2,704 civilians there — more than ISIS has. Putin has also been accused of ordering the deaths of journalists and political opponents in Russia. \nTrump has doggedly defended Putin against allegations of wrongdoing, including previous assertions that the Russian leader is a killer. \nIn December 2015, MSNBC host Joe Scarborough told Trump that Putin “kills journalists that don’t agree with him.” \n“Well, I think that our country does plenty of killing too, Joe,” Trump replied. \nIn another interview days later, Trump said he had heard that Putin kills people, but didn’t know whether to believe it. \n“I haven’t seen that,” Trump told ABC News. \n“I don’t know that he has. If he has killed reporters I think that’s terrible. But this isn’t like somebody that’s stood with a gun and he’s taken the blame or he’s admitted that he’s killed. He’s always denied it.” \nWith News Wire Services", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-06T20:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-06T15:51:28.638+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
