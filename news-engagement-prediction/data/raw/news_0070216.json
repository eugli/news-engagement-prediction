By Matthew Dunn   \nWhere he comes from, failure to do so does not mean losing out on a medal. It could cost you your life. \nThe Spain international defender was born in Pamplona where every July at the San Fermin festival they stage the Running of the Bulls. \nSix prize specimens are let loose into the street and the bravest of the townsfolk battle to keep in front of them along the entirety of a 900-yard channel between the streets as spectators wave and cheer from every balcony. \nEach ‘encierro’ is fraught with danger but it breeds a very single-minded type of person. \n“When I was a kid I went to San Fermin – it was a party!” says Azpilicueta. GETTY Cesat Azpilicueta used to go to the annual San Fermin festival in Pamplona GETTY Azpilicueta never took part in the Running of the Bulls but said a few ex-team-mates would \n“I have watched the bulls running but I have never taken part. I don’t think I ever would have done, even if I wasn’t a footballer. \n“But my ex-team-mates, a lot of them did it. And in the town, a lot of people prepared all year and got themselves fit enough to run just for those nine days. Everybody has their own passion. Perhaps my desire to be fit and run fast is a Pamplona thing!” \nCertainly, it has stuck. Azpilicueta is widely regarded among his peers as the fittest and hardest-working player in the Chelsea squad and even when he is on holiday with wife Adriana and his daughters Martina, two, and Carlota, eight months, he never fully relaxes. \n“Sometimes for a few days I would rest but I couldn’t sit for long. I had to go to the gym to run. To get myself fit I need to do something. \n“My girlfriend would get annoyed and say, ‘Come on we are on holidays!’ But she knows what I’m like. At least my kids give me an excuse to keep my energy up now. With them you have to get up!” Chelsea in training ahead of Swansea clash Thu, February 23, 2017", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T05:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:43:20.388+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
