(Photo: Aaron Doster-USA TODAY Sports) \nColts punter Pat McAfee announced on Wednesday night that, at 29 years old, he has decided to retire from the NFL to join Barstool Sports. The next night, Steelers wide receiver and punt returner Antonio Brown paid tribute to McAfee's career with this hilarious video. Yo @PatMcAfeeShow , ðŸŽµI will remember you ðŸŽµ ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ pic.twitter.com/5tkb1orFX1 â€” Antonio Brown (@AntonioBrown) February 3, 2017 \nThe video is of that one time in December of 2015 when Brown returned one of McAfee's punts for a 71-yard touchdown, and then proceeded to celebrate by hugging the goal post , which made for an iconic photo. BUT the best part is that the video is set to Sarah McLachlan's I Will Remember You - a perfect touch. \nBrown and McAfee had some good times together, even though they were on different teams. In addition to the moment Brown remembered in his video, there was also that other time when McAfee tweeted at Brown asking him to please refrain from kicking him in the face . Can you leave this particular move at home this weekend boss? @AntonioBrown84 pic.twitter.com/FyeLdwJk0P â€” Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) October 20, 2014 \nAdditionally, most recently, McAfee defended Brown on Twitter . The punter called out NFL Network for reporting that Brown was \"pouting\" after a touchdown. NFL Network..owned/operated by the NFL..reported @AntonioBrown was pouting after 1st td..so, lying 2 make superstars look bad is good 4 biz? pic.twitter.com/wU4MxMd3Ng â€” Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) January 24, 2017 \nIn an interview with For The Win on Thursday, Brown also said the reports that he was pouting on the field weren't true, but I'm sure he appreciated McAfee sticking up for him beforehand. \nAnyway, even though McAfee says he won't be playing in the NFL anymore, we'll probably see more great tweets and maybe even see more interactions with players since he'll still be working in sports.
