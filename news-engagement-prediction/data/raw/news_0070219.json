Developers of private projects along Thompson Street have already started constructing segments as their projects are built out.\nThe goal is to provide an easy way to get to some of Alpharetta’s most popular attractions and new developments, including a planned food hall where a location of The Varsity once operated and the Big Creek Greenway.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCySWi9RXE4"], "published": "2017-02-25T00:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T00:18:42.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
