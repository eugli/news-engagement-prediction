You just got to try and make the best of it,\" she said.\n\n'Unusual creativity' in Yarmouth \nSome teens in southwest Nova Scotia got some laughs with their artistic endeavour — and some unwanted attention from police. \nRCMP were called to a home in Yarmouth on Sunday afternoon after getting a call about a giant frosty phallus. \nPolice asked the people who built this sculpture to tear it down Sunday afternoon in Yarmouth, N.S.
