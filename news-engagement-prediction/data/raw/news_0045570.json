A look at the report card of some recent dance reality shows. A + A - Nach Baliye \nNach Baliye is back on small screen and TV buffs are excited about watching their favourite telly couples shake a leg. Mona Lisa-Vikrant Singh Rajpoot; Rohan Mehra-Kanchi Singh, Divyanka Tripathi-Vivek Dahiya, Dipika Kakar-Shoaib Ibrahim are some of the couples who will most likely be seen on the show. Also, we hear that Sonakshi Sinha will be adding Bollywood glamour to the show, as she has been roped in as one of the judges (earlier Kajol was in talks). Bipasha Basu and Karan Singh Grover are in talks to host the show. While the show seems to have roped in the perfect faces; does the line-up really guarantee its success? \nColors' recent show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa that had the combination of Bollywood star power and television's most popular faces, failed to create ripples. \nWe don't know whether people are no more interested in watching celebs perform or is it just the lack of innovation. \nDance reality shows in the recent past have a mixed track record as far as ratings are concerned. While Shilpa Shetty's brand new show Super Dancer--which had kids in the age group of 4-13 years as participants--captured the fancy of the viewers, Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa Season 9 failed to woo the audiences despite popular faces. Similarly, the charm and aura of Madhuri Dixit in So You Think You Can Dance could not pull the viewers in its direction, while Remo D'Souza's Dance Plus 2 featuring non-celebrity contestants was one of the biggest reality shows this year. We guess, more than anything else it's talent that impresses the audiences more than the star power these days. \nA look at how some of the recent dance reality shows fared. \nSO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE \nPremiere date : April 24, 2016 \nViewers verdict: Thumbs down \nUSP: Madhuri Dixit \nWhy we feel it didn't work: The show, hosted by Rithvik Dhanjani and Mouni Roy and judged by Madhuri Dixit, Terence Lewis and Bosco Martis was the Indian version of international franchise So You Think You Can Dance. The contestants performed in different dance styles, and we do feel it was a little niche for the Indian audiences, who love all things masala. Besides, it aired on &TV, which does not even figure in the list of Top 10 channels. While in its first week, it garnered the impressions of 2,133, the ratings further saw a downward trend after a month and came down to 1647. \nDANCE PLUS 2 \nPremiere date: July 2, 2016 \nViewers verdict: Thumbs up \nUSP: Remo D'Souza \nWhy we feel it worked: If you take Remo D'Souza out of Dance Plus 2, half of the viewers' interest is gone because we know that the man knows his craft. Besides, Dharmesh Yelande, Shakti Mohan and Punit Pathak, the mentors combined with the extremely talented dancers who did not shy away from working on themselves and trying new things could be credited for the show's success. Tanay Malhara's journey in the show was full of ups and downs and truly fascinating. It is the power of common man that ultimately led to the success of the show. The show garnered 4905* impressions, as per the BARC India report published on September 8. \nJHALAK DIKHHLA JAA 9 \nPremiere date: July 30, 2016 \nViewers verdict: Thumbs down \nUSP: New judge Jacqueline Fernandez \nWhy we feel it didn't work: Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 9 promised a brand-new format, a brand-new judge and a fresh set of celeb contestants. This year, the makers experimented with a lot of themes too. But we do feel, the quality of talent was average. We all know that these celebrites are actors first. The lack of passion just couldn't strike the chord with the audiences, we guess. \nSUPER DANCER \nPremiere date: September 10, 2016 \nViewers verdict: Thumbs up \nUSP: Shilpa Shetty \nWhy we feel it worked: We all have to admit that we tuned into this show for Shilpa Shetty initially; the other judges were director Anurag Basu and choreographer Geeta Kapur. But soon, the super kids who participated in the show stole our hearts, completely. It was difficult to decide who was the best. It was the talent, the raw energy and the passion that made us come back to the show week after week. The show garnered 6964* impressions for the week Nov 12-18, according to BARC India. \nBut the question remains--will Nach Baliye be able to top the rating charts? Only time will tell.
