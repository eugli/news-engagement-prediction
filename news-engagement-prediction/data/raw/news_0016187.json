Gallagher tried to track his estranged wife's movements by hiding an iPhone under the bonnet of her car \nT he truth only emerged when Morgan, 18, took the Renault Clio to a local garage and a mechanic found the iPhone near the engine under a covered metal section. \nEnquiries revealed Gallagher, who runs a property management firm, had been using an iPad to track the iPhone so he could follow and keep his wife under surveillance whenever she was out. \nHe would also turn up to venues where she was by using the app. \nThe incident was the culmination of a four-month stalking campaign by father-of-one Gallagher during which he bombarded her with text messages, sent her lurid pictures of his private parts and images of her sleeping in various stages of undress, JPs in Manchester were told. \nThe couple, from Urmston, had married in February 2010 and had a son together but they had a tempestuous relationship. \nMs Harvey, who had three children including Morgan from a previous relationship, said her husband was \"violent and caused distress\" and the split up last year. The break up was amicable at first, but then he continually called and messaged her, 43 times messaging her and trying to consistently follow and contact her on social media, and her friends refusing to accept that the marriage was over Eileen Rogers, prosecuting \nE ileen Rogers, prosecuting, said: \"Mr Gallagher would rip her clothes off of her, punch her which caused an injury to her ribs and gave her a black eye. \n\"She has said that he was very controlling, and would ask her who she was with and where she was going and continued with this behaviour even during the time she was pregnant. \n\"His controlling behaviour continued so that she did go out with her friends anymore. She said that she was not mentally strong enough to leave him. \n\"One evening he went out to work and he failed to return home. She contacted him and told him that she did not what him to come back to the marital home and she was leaving him. \n\"The break up was amicable at first, but then he continually called and messaged her, 43 times messaging her and trying to consistently follow and contact her on social media, and her friends refusing to accept that the marriage was over. \n\"But he sent her images of his private parts and pictures of her sleeping in stages of undress. She contacted the police and reported the harassment.\" \nThe iPhone was discovered on December 28 last year when clothes shop assistant Morgan took the family car to a local garage. \n\"They heard a phone ringing but they could not find where the noise was coming from,\" said Miss Rogers. \nThe ringtone did not match any of the occupants in the car. A mechanic at the garage found in a covered metal section of the car a black iPhone. \nPolice were contacted and investigated the contents of the phone, the messages and they went to speak to Mr Gallagher. \n\"Another black iPhone was found concealed in a sock and these phones the police discovered were used by Mr Gallagher to track his partner and her daughter when they travelled in the car and he would turn up at the venue where he knew she was,\" added the prosecutor. \n\"When he was arrested Mr Gallagher had with him another pink iPhone and an iPad which he also used to track her. The devices were all registered to Rachael. She does want a restraining order to protect herself and her family.\" \nThe court heard Gallagher had previous convictions for violence including common assault on Morgan last December which resulted in her getting a restraining order against him. \nIn mitigation, defence lawyer Jeremy Spencer said: \"Mr Gallagher has got a firm which he runs called K Gallagher and Son which was originally run by his father. It is a property management firm which has been operational for 34 years. Mr Gallagher's mother also died 18 months ago, which is something that he is still dealing with. \n\"It is a competitive area of work, and it has been difficult for them to get cover for him in the last few days. \n\"He employs two people, one for the driving, but he is the one who is on call at all hours of the day because of the nature of the work. They currently have a large job on at the Christie hospital. He can sometimes end up working a 14 hour day, at any time of the day or night. \n\"He is on call to any properties throughout the day and the night so an electrical curfew may not be suitable. I have spoken to the defendants father who has made it clear that he is unable to carry on with the business.\" \nGallagher admitted a charge of stalking by sending numerous text messages, making contact via social media and placing a tracking device in her vehicle in order to ascertain her movements. He was due to be sentenced but fled before it was due to take place. \nA warrant was issued for his arrest.
