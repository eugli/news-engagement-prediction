Article continues below Wayne Shaw reveals the real reason he ate a pie during the Arsenal game \nIn his first three years at City, Nasri won the league twice, while Arsenal have won one FA Cup in that time. \nBased on that evidence, it's not surprising that the 29-year-old jumped ship and made the controversial move to City, where he has since fallen down the pecking order and is currently out on loan at La Liga outfit Sevilla. Nasri critical of Gooners \nBut Nasri has criticised Arsenal fans for the treatment of their long-serving manager who has seen a growing number of supporters turn against him over the past few seasons, as they continue to falter when it truly matters. \nThe Gunners recently folded at home to Watford, suffering a shock 2-1 defeat, while they were equally abysmal in their following league outing, losing 3-1 to league leaders Chelsea and all but ending their hopes of winning the league. \nAnd last week's 5-1 thrashing by Bayern Munich in the Champions League compounded Wenger's misery, although Nasri has insisted the fans must remember what the 67-year-old has done for the club historically. Impossible to criticise Wenger \n\"You cannot criticise a guy like that, it is impossible. Arsenal was a big club but he made it even bigger,\" Nasri told Sky Sports . \n\"People need to be fair. It is not because Arsenal don't have success in the league that it's his fault, that is the players who are on the pitch, it's the players who do not get the results. \n\"I don't think it's him, there are a lot of things at Arsenal; the players, the board, that need to be checked out and not just Arsene.\" \nNasri scored 27 goals during 125 appearances for Arsenal, and the experienced France midfielder is exactly the kind of player Wenger would wish he could call upon during the current testing period for the legendary Gunners boss. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
