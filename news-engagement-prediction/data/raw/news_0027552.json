With eight wins from nine matches, India went into the finals as the favourites and lived up to it with a comprehensive victory. \nFor Pakistan, though, it was their first loss in the tournament. \nThe two teams had clashed in the 2012 edition finals where India again emerged triumphant. \nBatting first, Pakistan made 197/9 but India chased down the target in 18 overs, losing just one wicket in the process. \nMan-of-the-match Prakash Jayaramaiah stood out with a splendid unbeaten 99-run knock and Ajay Kumar Reddy was the only man to be dismissed for 43. Ketan Patel and Jaffar Iqbal were the pick of Indian bowlers, grabbing two wickets each after conceding 29 and 33 runs, respectively. \nMan-of-the-series Badar Munir was the top-scorer for Pakistan with a 570-run effort.
