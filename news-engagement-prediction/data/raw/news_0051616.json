A post shared by Sidharth Malhotra (@s1dofficial) on Feb 20, 2017 at 6:08am PST \nThe film will see Siddharth Malhotra and Sonakshi Sinha share screen space for the first time. However, they will not be paired romantically. The original film starred the late Rajesh Khanna, Bindu and Nanda. It will be directed by Abhay Chopra, the grandson of late filmmaker and Yash's elder brother BR Chopra. BR Films will also join forces with Red Chillies Entertainment and Dharma Productions in producing the venture. \nThank YOU @iamsrk , @karanjohar and of #BRFilms ... was an amazing first day on set today with you all! Great start to our #Ittefaq journey! https://t.co/wVp7T9uo77 — Sonakshi Sinha (@sonakshisinha) February 20, 2017 \nThis will mark Sinha's first collaboration with both the production houses. On the other hand, Malhotra has already worked on two joint productions of these banners - the 2010 Johar directorial My Name Is Khan starring Khan, in which he was an assistant director. Malhotra also made his acting debut with yet another Johar directorial and joint production of these two banners - Student of the Year in 2012. \nBesides these two films, Malhotra has also starred in four Dharma movies - Vinil Mathew's 2014 romantic comedy Hasee Toh Phasee , Karan Malhotra's 2015 sports drama Brothers , Shakun Batra's 2016 family drama Kapoor and Sons and Nitya Mehra's 2016 romantic comedy Baar Baar Dekho. My fav films by Yashji #Ittefaq is being recreated by Abhay. Thx @S1dharthM @sonakshisinha Akshaye. Also BR & Dharma Films tie up with RCE \n— Shah Rukh Khan (@iamsrk) February 20, 2017 \nSRK said that Ittefaq is one of his favourite Yash Chopra films. He has starred in the last four directorials of Chopra, including Darr, Dil Toh Pagal Hai, Veer-Zara and Jab Tak Hai Jaan . Johar has also harboured a special relationship with Chopra as it was under the latter's banner Yash Raj Films that he entered the film industry as an AD and a supporting actor in the 1995 classic Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T13:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T09:14:15.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
