The Department of Education’s Twitter account suffered an embarrassing couple of mistakes that stirred up mockery around freshly minted Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. First, the account misspelled W.E.B. Du Bois’ name and then made a typo in its apology tweet hours later. \nThe @GOP fake Lincoln tweet has been live, as of this writing, for six hours after being posted, despite a tremendous amount of jokes and mockery being sent in its direction. Perhaps whomever's in charge is opting to ride it out? \nIn any case, it's a worthwhile reminder that before tweeting out a quote from a famous speaker, especially one outside anyone's living memory, you ought to do a little snooping on Google to make sure it's legit. If it can't actually be traced back to a credible source or if it strictly pops up on quote aggregation sites like BrainyQuote.com, maybe you're better off not hitting \"send\" after all.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T05:29:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-13T00:47:50.199+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
