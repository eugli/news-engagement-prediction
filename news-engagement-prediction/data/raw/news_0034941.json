The drum and bass legend has also shared the lead single from the project called “I Adore You,” featuring Ulterior Motive, which you can listen to below. The 16-track set will include contributions from vocalists Natalie Duncan, Terri Walker, Tyler Lee Daly, Natalie Williams, José James, Naomi Pryor, and Goldie’ s wife Mika Wassenaar Price. It follows Goldie’s 2013 3xCD compilation The Alchemist: The Best of Goldie 1992-2012 , which marked the producer’s 20th anniversary in music. \nIn a press release, Goldie says he took a directorial approach in constructing the album: \nI often look at music not so much as a producer but like a director. You’re drawing together engineers, performers and arrangers to create something special, something magical. It’s like alchemy. The notes, the music, the lyrics, they’re all in my head and each element has to be communicated and brought to life to create the finished track. I’m always inspired by great movie directors – people like Stanley Kubrick and PT Anderson – and, if you think about it, it’s quite a similar approach. They start off with a vision and then they use that vision to deploy the actors and the cameramen and the editors in order to create the finished film. \nGoldie will also perform two dates at London’s Ronnie Scott venue on February 24 and 25, along with Heritage Ensemble and vocalists from The Journey Man .
