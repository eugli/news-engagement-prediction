Amazon has lowered its free shipping minimum for non-Prime members to $35 -- a nearly 29% drop. \nThe company increased its free shipping threshold to $49 from $35 almost a year ago. \nItems will be delivered five to eight days after they are available to ship. \nAmazon didn't specify exactly when the minimum was lowered, but did say the change happened \"recently.\" \nOrders that contain at least $25 of eligible books also ship free. \nShoppers with an Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) Prime membership , which costs $10.99 a month or $99 a year, get unlimited free two-day shipping on eligible items along with other benefits like streaming TV, movies and music. \nRelated: Move over, Amazon: Here comes Walmart \nAs more people turn to online shopping, Walmart ( WMT ) and Amazon have been competing for customers. \nWalmart started offering free two-day shipping without a membership fee on orders of at least $35 on January 31. It had previously offered unlimited free two-day shipping with its $49-a-year-ShippingPass subscription. \nOn Tuesday, Walmart reported its e-commerce revenue increased 29% in the fourth quarter from a year ago. Amazon reported earlier this month that total sales rose 22% in the same period. \nCNNMoney (New York)   5:01 PM ET", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T00:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T00:39:41.047+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
