you might catch President Donald Trump's son-in-law and top Mideast dealmaker, Jared Kushner, by the beachside soft serve ice cream machine, or his reclusive chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, on the dining patio. If you are lucky, the President himself could stop by your table for a quick chat. But you will have to pay $US200,000 ($260,000) for the privilege - and the few available spots are going fast. \nVirtually overnight, Mar-a-Lago, Trump's members-only club in Palm Beach, Florida, has been transformed into the part-time capital of US government, a winter White House where Trump has entertained a foreign head of state, health care industry executives and other presidential guests.

More videos Donald Trump's combative rambling press conference \nPresident Donald Trump spars with reporters for more than an hour, declaring his administration is 'running like a fine-tuned machine' even though he 'inherited a mess'. \nBut Trump's gatherings at Mar-a-Lago - he arrived there on Friday afternoon, his third weekend visit in a row - have also created an arena for potential political influence rarely seen in US history: a kind of Washington steakhouse on steroids, situated in a sunny playground of the rich and powerful, where members and their guests enjoy a level of access that could elude even the best-connected of lobbyists. \nMembership lists reviewed by The New York Times show that the club's nearly 500 paying members include dozens of real estate developers, Wall Street financiers, energy executives and others whose businesses could be affected by Trump's policies. At least three club members are under consideration for an ambassadorship. Most of the 500 have had memberships pre-dating Trump's presidential campaign, and there are a limited number of memberships still available.

Yet another member is Janet Weiner, part owner and chief financial officer of the Rockstar energy drink company, which has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying federal officials to avoid tighter regulations on its products.

While they did not discuss any of Toll's specific projects, the two would occasionally discuss national issues, such as Trump's plans to increase spending on highways and other infrastructure projects. \n\"Maybe you ought to do this or that,\" Toll said of the kind of advice that Trump got from club members.

First, he said, only 20 to 40 new members are admitted per year, and second, the wealthy business executives who frequent the club, among others, have many ways to communicate with the federal government if they want to. \n\"It assumes the worst of us and everyone, and that is unfair,\" Eric Trump said.

Letter to Trump from Democratic senators \nMar-a-Lago, she added, is \"one of the most successful private clubs in the world,\" and it \"was intended to be the Southern White House, and the President looks forward to hosting many world leaders at this remarkable property.\" \nBut unlike the real White House, there is no public access, and no official visitor log is available. When the White House press corps accompanied Donald Trump to the club and nearby golf course last weekend, they were housed during part of the trip in a room whose windows had been covered with black plastic.

His company, Oxbow Carbon, is among the world's largest sellers of petroleum coke, an oil byproduct, and would be a significant beneficiary of the Keystone XL pipeline, construction of which is a Trump administration priority. \nBrad Goldstein, a spokesman for William Koch, said that he did not know whether the two men had ever discussed policy matters. \"If I did know,\" Goldstein added, \"the answer would be that I decline to comment.\" SHARE The Mar-a-Lago resort, the so-called winter White House, in Palm Beach, Florida. Photo: Al Drago/The New York Times A history of presidential mansions \nHistorically, of course, US presidents have often been rich men with mansions, who sometimes conducted the people's business in weekend haunts of the wealthy: The Bush compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, for example, or the Kennedy family home in Hyannisport, Massachusetts. \nPresident Dwight Eisenhower joined the elite Augusta National Golf Club before he was elected, frequently hanging out there with a group of affluent businessmen who became known as \"the gang,\" which included top executives from Coca-Cola, an oil company, an investment banker and a lawyer-financier-lobbyist. SHARE Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, the so-called winter White House, in Palm Beach, Florida.

It is kind of amazing.\" \nJohn Dean, who served as White House counsel during the Nixon administration and has been a frequent Trump critic, noted that President Richard Nixon used to fly down to Florida to stay in an earlier winter White House: a private home in Key Biscayne that had also earned that name. But that arrangement was entirely different, Dean said, as Nixon was staying at a private home, not surrounded by some of the nation's wealthiest business executives.

Clients of Duberstein's firm include Alibaba Group, the Chinese internet company; Amgen and Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giants; and Dow Chemical and America's Health Insurance Plans, which represents the nation's largest health insurers. \nLike other members interviewed for this article, Duberstein said he did not bring up business matters with any Trump administration officials when visiting the club, which also is near a home he owns. \n\"It is a social thing,\" he said. \"It is not a business thing.\" \nChristopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime donor to and a friend of the President, said Trump had always conducted what amounted to informal focus groups on a variety of topics, but that face time with him since the election had become restricted to family and old friends. \n\"It's a myth to think that anybody could just join the club and go speak to the President,\" Ruddy said, adding that the Secret Service has instituted a de facto rope line around the President's table in recent weeks, which several other club members confirmed. \nBut the weekly gatherings at Mar-a-Lago have drawn some scrutiny from Democrats in the Senate, who called for Trump to release a list of all of the members. \n\"Your winter White House will provide an audience with you for those who can afford it, not to mention an increasing cash-flow into your family-run organisation,\" Democratic senators Sheldon Whitehouse and Tom Udall wrote in a letter sent to Trump this month. \n\"Instead of draining the swamp, it appears you're bringing Washington right to the swamps at Mar-a-Lago.\" How you get inside \nMar-a-Lago has never been snooty in the manner of some private clubs in Palm Beach; under Trump, it has long welcomed Jews, gay couples, Republicans and Democrats. (So long as they could afford the entry fee, that is: Mar-a-Lago doubled that fee to $US200,000 shortly after Trump was elected; members also pay $US14,000 in annual dues.) Trump spent years populating his club with people rejected by rival clubs, while also urging his friends to join. \nSeveral members said Trump's pronouncements on hot-button topics such as immigration - and in particular his recent move to ban visas for visitors from certain nations - had caused some friction among the members at Mar-a-Lago. But Bernd Lembcke, the club's managing director, said that applications had risen since Trump's election. \n\"It enhances it - his presidency does,\" Lembcke said, referring to membership in the club. \"People are now even more interested in becoming members. But we are very careful in vetting them.\" And potential members must be sponsored by a current one, he said. \"You still have to be introduced.\" \nThe list of members is a who's who of the world of global finance and real estate, but it is also sprinkled with other boldfaced names, like Howie Carr, the Boston radio show host, and Bill Belichick, head coach of the New England Patriots, according to three lists reviewed by The Times , from 2015 through earlier this year. \nSeveral members are also major campaign contributors to Trump, like Ruddy and Brian Burns, a businessman and lawyer whom Trump has indicated he intends to nominate as ambassador to Ireland, records show. \nOne longtime member is Richard LeFrak, a fellow New York developer and one of Trump's closest friends, who in turn has recruited some of his own friends to join. Jeff Greene, a former Florida Senate candidate in 2010, said that he joined at the urging of LeFrak. \nBut Mar-a-Lago, where Trump's old New York circle blurs easily into his presidency, is a place where the president of the United States might seek guidance on a major government project the way another New Yorker might ask around for a good orthopedist. \nWhen LeFrak paid a visit to Trump at Mar-a-Lago last weekend, he appeared a little startled when Trump, in a brief interlude during the conversation, told him that the Department of Homeland Security was quoting a price of more than $US20 billion for the proposed border wall with Mexico. \n\"He said, would I consider doing it? And then he suggested that the price that was being quoted in the media seemed absurdly high to him,\" LeFrak said. He is not interested in the work, but said, \"And I didn't react to him one way or the other because I don't know what the facts are.\" \nLeFrak said to the President, \"I thought you were going to have Homeland Security deal with this,\" he recalled, describing Trump as stymied by the bureaucracy. \"And he said, 'Yes, maybe General Kelly will call you.'\" \nThe New York Times", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T09:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T04:27:35.340+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
