I didn’t have the courage to try and straighten it and he was at the door saying ‘I’ll fix it’ and ‘sorry’, that it would never happen again.\n“I couldn’t go to work, I had two black eyes and a broken nose, that was the beginning of it. There were many others.”\nDomestic violence among gay couples is often not talked about. Source: News Limited \nMr Vickery was in the relationship for five years and endured many other violent incidents including the time his drunk partner grabbed a knife and held it at his throat for an hour.\nThe 58-year-old said he finally decided to leave the abusive relationship after one particularly shocking incident when his partner threw him down the stairs in front of his children.\n“I broke bones and was in hospital for two operations and that really was the culmination of the relationship,” he said.\nEven after it was over, Mr Vickery said he was self-harming and one night he almost committed suicide, sitting down with a bottle of valium and vodka.\n“You start doing the work for them,” he said. “The only thing that stopped me was I looked up and saw a photo of my kids.”\nMr Vickery said he didn’t want his children find him that way in a couple of days time.\n“That was the bottom of the barrel but there’s only one direction to go from there and that’s up.”\nMr Vickery managed to deal with his past and has now developed a cabaret show The Other Closet with new partner Matthew Parsons, exploring the issue of domestic violence within gay relationships.\nMr Parsons, who has also experienced domestic violence and is a research officer specialising in LGBTI domestic and family violence at La Trobe University, said studies had shown same-sex couples experienced violence at similar rates to heterosexual couples.\nBut there are specific myths that get in the way of people recognising abuse within the gay community.\n“When things do come to light, it turns out (the abuse) was disclosed to multiple doctors, teachers and others,” Mr Parsons told news.com.au.\nIn one case, Mr Parsons said the children had told many people they were being locked in a closet while their mother was being abused, and the woman had also told a number of professionals, but because she was in a lesbian relationship, no action was taken.\n“There is this pervasive myth that when it’s two women it’s not that bad,” Mr Parsons said.\n“When it’s between two men, there’s this pervasive myth that a real man would stand up for himself, and surely both men would be abusive towards each other.\n“When it comes to trans relationships, there’s lower expectations about what trans people should expect from life, that if they are in a relationship at all, they should feel lucky because who would love someone like that? There’s a lot of disgusting (views).”\nTogether for five years: Partners Matthew Parsons (left) and Russ Vickery have collaborated on a cabaret show The Other Closet.

Mr Parsons had even seen publicity for The Other Closet used on promotional material to support the arguments of those against marriage equality.\n“They see it as proof of why we shouldn’t be able to get married, but (domestic violence) happens in much greater numbers among the heterosexual community and they’re not questioning why they get married,” he said.\nMr Parsons said addressing violence was difficult when homophobia seemed to be ingrained in the community and stopped things such as same-sex marriage being accepted.\nWhen it comes to family violence, Mr Parsons said young people’s reports of being assaulted by family members were sometimes ignored because it was accepted that parents were entitled to have traditional views.\nWhile it’s not yet clear how prevalent this type of family violence is, Dr Philomena Horsley of La Trobe University said LGBTI people could be at greater risk of assault from family members due to entrenched homophobia.\n“Anecdotally, many people in the community, of different ages, have reported that coming out to family is a potential trigger for family-related violence,” she said.\nVictorian research suggests that young LGBTI are more likely to be homeless than other young people.\n“This finding suggests a greater proportion of young LGBTI people face violence at home and have to leave, or are rejected and need to leave, or are kicked out when they disclose.”\nHelping LGBTI people to recognise and reject domestic and family violence is one thing Mr Parsons and Mr Vickery hope to encourage through their show The Other Closet .\n“I’m prepared to expose myself on the stage so that other people can recognise those feelings” Mr Vickery said.\nInterestingly, when the show was staged in Sydney, heterosexual women made up half the audience.\n“After we did the show, we know of six people who left relationships, those are the ones we know about.”\nMr Vickery said nowadays people did have more access to services and were more confident about seeking them out, but there still weren’t many specific services for LGBTI people.\n“It’s getting better but needs to get a whole lot better,” he said.\nIf you or someone you know needs help, go to qlife.org.au or call 1800 184 527 .\ncharis.chang@news.com.au", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T20:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T04:47:03.430+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
