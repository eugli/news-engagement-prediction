Man sends woman bill for Â£42.50 after she turned him down for second date \nBut he has now been left with just the clothes on his back after a ruthless thief stole the cycle from outside a Co-Op store in Kingston upon Thames, south west London. \nRob, from Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, said: â€˜I had stopped outside Co-Op on Friday evening, at 8:20, to get some food on my way to house sit. \nâ€˜I left the bike outside but I didnâ€™t lock it, because I only went inside for a minute. \nâ€˜I always lock it usually but I thought it would be okay, I never expect someone to even be able to wheel it away because it weighs 65kg. \nâ€˜But I came outside and it was gone â€“ there was no trace of it.

The punniest jokes from this year's annual pun championships \nâ€˜I had nearly finished the book and now everything is gone. There were about 15,000 photos, plus all my stuff â€“ things I canâ€™t ever get back, like business cards from people Iâ€™ve met across the world. \nâ€˜The stuff was worth between Â£6-8,000, but I donâ€™t care about the money. Just to have one hard drive back would be amazing, the memories are all gone. That means the photo book is cancelled and the words book is on hold. \nâ€˜Iâ€™ve got loads of stuff online but all the ones I took in the Himalayas and Australia are gone, theyâ€™re probably in a bin somewhere.â€™ \nThe intrepid adventurer had a number of dangerous encounters during his trip. \nIn 2013, he cycled China from east to west â€“ a massive 3,200 miles â€“ in the middle of winter. \nDuring his next stop in Hong Kong, he ran out of money, and was homeless for eight months while he started a Kickstarter to raise funds. \nThe following year, in Malaysia, his bike was split in two during a horrific car crash, and he was attacked, before flying to Australia with just Â£50 to his name. \nRob is maintaining a positive outlook following the theft, and says he is trying not to dwell on the incident. \nHe has now been left with no choice but to walk to his next house-sit in Cambridge â€“ 65 miles. \nRob said: â€˜Everyoneâ€™s support has been incredible. \nâ€˜Iâ€™ve had people offering to give me a computer, helping me however they can and telling people to look out for the bike. \nâ€˜Iâ€™ve had bikes stolen before but not like this â€“ everything is gone, right down to my passport. \nâ€˜I got to the house with the clothes on my back, my phone and my leggings. \nâ€˜I was devastated on Saturday, but there are too many things to sit and be depressed about. \nâ€˜The person who stole it probably didnâ€™t even think about it, they just wanted money, so Iâ€™m not concerned about dwelling on whoever did it. \nâ€˜Now Iâ€™ve got to go off to Cambridge, and Iâ€™ve got four days to walk there. \nâ€˜I got a notepad so Iâ€™m just going to start the book again from scratch. \nâ€˜Thereâ€™s no point being angry, Iâ€™m sure good things can come out of it.â€™ \nA Metropolitan Police spokesman said: â€˜Police were called at 20:40hrs on Friday, 10 February after a man reported his bicycle had been stolen from Kings Road, Kingston. \nâ€˜The victim, aged in his 30s, also reported a number of items were on the bike at the time and were also stolen. \nâ€˜Officers from Kingston-upon-Thames are investigating. \nâ€˜No arrests, and enquiries continue.â€™ More ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-15T19:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-15T14:37:30.935+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
