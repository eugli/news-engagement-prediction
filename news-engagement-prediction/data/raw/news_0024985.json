The governor accepted his resignation the next day but on Wednesday Panneerselvam revolted, saying he was forced to resign and was willing to reconsider his decision. \nThe governor, who arrived in Chennai on Thursday afternoon, reportedly gave no assurance to either of the two. He is expected to consult legal experts and examine all claims before him, satisfy himself and then take a decision, sources said. \nThe governor is understood to have sent a report to the Centre and President though he has not taken any decision. \nSpeculation is also rife that the governor could take time to study the issue in depth, consult legal and constitutional experts and wait for the Supreme Court verdict on a disproportionate assets case in which Sasikala is an accused. According to sources, the verdict could come early next week. “I briefed the governor about the political developments in the state, want to stress that dharma will win” -OPanneerselvam \n“We had a detailed discussion…about all that is happening in Tamil Nadu...For sure, good thing will happen, dharma will win,” Panneerselvam told reporters at his residence after returning from the Raj Bhavan. \nHe quoted a popular Tamil verse of nationalist poet Subramanya Bharathi, the import of which is, “though dharma could be eclipsed by intrigue, it will be dharma which will triumph ultimately”. He, however, did not take any questions. \nShortly afterwards, Sasikala visited Jayalalithaa’s memorial at Marina Beach prior to her meeting with the governor. \nAttired in her signature green saree, a teary-eyed Sasikala placed before at memorial an envelope believed to be the list of MLAs who have endorsed her candidature for the top post.

Sasikala’s supporters have threatened to challenge the decision, saying the residence was not a government property.
