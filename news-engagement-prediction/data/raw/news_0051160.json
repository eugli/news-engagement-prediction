A cocktail, for starters. At last night's epic party for LOVE Magazine , guests like Ellie Goulding, Justine Skye, and Helena Christensen got to toast Kendall Jenner with engraved bottles of Belvedere Vodka, personalized just for the now-21-year-old. (You can make your own for about $175.) A post shared by CLC (@claralucinda) on Feb 20, 2017 at 1:59pm PST   Jenner arrived in a bespoke Burberry hoodie that was literally fresh off the runway—model McKenna Hellam had worn it just two hours earlier—and proceeded to jump into the DJ booth with British radio star Nick Grimshaw. (Think Ryan Seacrest, mixed with those kids you'd party with in abandoned warehouses.) She played \"Bad + Boujee\" by Migos and \"Man Don't Care\" by JME , which—fun fact #1—has a Harry Potter spell as one of the lyrics. Most Popular Among those on the packed dance floor: Jordyn Woods, Winnie Harlow, and Hari Nef, who was photographed by Jenner for LOVE's latest issue. (She wore one of J.W.Anderson's recent catwalk hits, which—fun fact #2—was also worn on the runway by McKenna Hellam . Do you think it's a sign?) Though Kendall was sans Kylie, the party was a family affair: sisters Bella and Gigi Hadid were there, along with siblings Rafferty and Iris Law, and the mother-daughter duo Camilla Lowther and Adwoa Aboah . \"Katie [Grand] is kind of a fashion mum,\" said breakout designer Matty Bovan, whose neon embroideries are a new London obsession. \"She really looks out for us all.\" Nurturing new talent while throwing thumping dance parties: We'll drink to that.
