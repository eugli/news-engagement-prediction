He clarified that he had been handed the envelope for best actress, rather than best picture. \"I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land . That's why I looked at Faye, and at you. I wasn't trying to be funny,\" he admitted. \nOn Beatty's explanation, Stone noted, \"I also was holding my best actress in a leading role card that entire time. I don't mean to start stuff, but whatever story that was…\" \nStone's stunned reaction to the mishap was captured by viewers on Twitter.

A close-up of the envelope in Beatty's hand shows it was indeed for best actress.
