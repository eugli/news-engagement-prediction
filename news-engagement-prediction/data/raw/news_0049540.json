Just as Donald Trump needs to get over it when he decides to start a flame war against a critic, the press needs to get over it when Trump complains about them… \nIt’s fair to make the case President Trump is attempting to delegitimize the press. But in the course of his near one month in office, he’s delegitimized the judiciary, Congress, NATO, the intelligence community and more. Every day the press is busy fighting on Trump’s turf by battling him about themselves, is another day issues such as the repeal of Obamacare, tax cuts and the nomination of Neil Gorsuch remain untouched. \nAnd beyond that, he told Brian Stelter this morning, Trump’s words towards the press are getting far more attention than President Obama ‘s actions: \n“What’s important is when President Trump starts to do something. Right now he’s only saying things. And I don’t remember this level of outrage from members in the media when President Obama––his Justice Department named journalist James Rosen as a conspirator in an Espionage Act case against a leaker. That’s, in my view, far worse than anything Donald Trump tweets.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-19T23:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-19T18:53:05.629+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
