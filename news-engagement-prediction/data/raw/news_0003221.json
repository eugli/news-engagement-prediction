It closes by 3.30pm. \nAnuar said the favourite among customers was the mutton curry served with Middle Eastern rice. It is served on a large platter and is meant to be shared by up to four diners. \nSiti Noor Afizi Saad, 34, said she did not mind travelling all the way from Muar to the restaurant to sample the mutton curry. \n“I have eaten here more than five times.” \nNoraini Abd Majid, 58, and her family of six came for the first time. \nShe gave the signature dish a thumbs-up. \n“I hope to return soon,” said the housewife.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-01T23:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-02T02:14:40.203+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
