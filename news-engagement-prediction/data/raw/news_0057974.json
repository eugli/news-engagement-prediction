(CBC)\nDinn said Friday the commitment to education isn't making him happy.\n\"It gives us some measure of comfort that the allocation model is not going to be altered, but the damage is done,\" he said.\n\"The cuts were made in budget 2016. We've been living with those effects throughout this year and that's not acceptable.\"\nDinn said in particular there aren't enough teachers to deal with inclusive education, an issue that has been raised during CBC's series Inside the Classroom .", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-25T01:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-25T06:16:17.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
