By Mary Papenfuss \nDonald Trump’s counselor Kellyanne Conway should face sanctions for “professional misconduct,” which include repeated lies and ethics breaches, according to a formal complaint filed by 15 law professors across the nation. \n“We do not file this complaint lightly,” states the letter filed earlier this week by legal ethics professors from such prestigious universities as Yale, Georgetown, Fordham and Duke. “We believe that, at one time, Ms. Conway understood her ethical responsibilities as a lawyer and abided by them. But she is currently behaving in a way that brings shame upon the legal profession.” \nConway obtained a law degree from George Washington University Law School. She was admitted to the Washington D.C. bar in 1995, though is currently suspended for nonpayment of dues, according to the complaint. \nThe letter, which was obtained by the Washington Post , was sent to the Washington D.C. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of the Board of Professional Responsibility, which addresses complaints about members of the local bar. \nThe letter lists Conway’s lies, including those about the non-existent “ Bowling Green Massacre ” to justify Donald Trump’s ban against travelers from seven mostly Muslim countries. Not only was there no massacre, but “Ms. Conway knew there was no massacre,” the filing states. \nThe complaint also upbraids Conway’s touting of “alternative facts” — which are “not facts at all; they are lies ,” the letter notes. \nFinally, Conway’s touting of products sold by Ivanka Trump on national TV were a “clear violation of government ethics rules, which a lawyer and a member of the bar should surely know,” the document states. \nThe complaint concludes that Conway’s “conduct, clearly violative of the rules that regulate her professional status, cries out for sanctioning” by the bar. \nThere was no immediate response from the White House.
