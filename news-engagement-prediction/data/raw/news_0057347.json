S evilla boss Jorge Sampaoli \n\"We're not talking about the team that won a league miraculously, you have to live in the now. So last year Leicester won the league but right now they are fighting relegation.\n\"The present matters the most. Ranieri got so much from the team last year with so little but now he is struggling, the past doesn't matter, even when you have done something as miraculous as he did.\n\"I think Leicester are not having a good time in the league, they have a lot of doubts when last year they had so much belief. They were brilliant in the league last year and have been great in the Champions League, they qualified very quickly so in a two-legged tie it still poses a lot of risks for us.\"\nLeicester coach Claudio Ranieri \n“Nothing is right in the league and we are clearly underdogs here in Sevilla. We are playing without the pressure of the Premier League, we play light, for this reason I hope we can play our football.\n“Tomorrow could be the turning point, if we have a very good game something inside could change. We need one match like this.”\nWhat are the odds? Sevilla to win - 4/11 \nDraw - 19/5 \nLeicester to win - 8/1 \nWhat's our prediction? Without the pressures of their Premier League struggles weighing on their shoulders, Leicester could snatch a goal on the break but end up losing the first leg 2-1. It would be a crucial away goal, though.\nThink you can predict the outcome? Answer these six multiple choice questions via Telegraph Predictor and you could walk away with a cash prize.
