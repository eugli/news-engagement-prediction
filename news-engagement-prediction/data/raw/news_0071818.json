By Manisha Nandrajog | Updated: February 23, 2017 4:27 pm Drashti Dhami, Toral Rasputra, Siddharth Shukla, Tina Dutta celebrate Holi Colors' style \nIt was quite a shock when Simar aka Dipika Kakar left the show, Sasural Simar Ka. Apparently the actress wanted to focus on her personal life and chose to leave the show for the same. \nBut as they say, the show must go on. We hear that now Keerti Gaekwad Kelkar has been roped in for the role of Simar on the show. The actress will be returning to the TV screen after a gap of six long years. She confirmed this news with a leading daily saying that she wanted to return to the screen with a good project. \nThe show Sasural Simar Ka is going to change the focus of the show and bring it back to the mother-daughter relationship. Keerthi believes that she might be perfect for Simar’s role as she can relate to her, but she says that she is still nervous as she will be facing the camera after a long gap. Keerti also admitted that the character of Simar has already been established and it would be a challenge to lend some freshness to the character. \nRecently, SSS Productions threw a farewell party for the show’s former leading lady, Dipika Kakar. The actress got emotional and put up a post sharing a picture from the green room on the sets. Dipika was friends with most of her co-stars and people will miss her snaps with her pet Cuddles in the dressing room. The show was not a bed of roses for the actress, who recovered from a failed marriage during the course of the show. Last year, she threw a party to celebrate six years of the saga.
