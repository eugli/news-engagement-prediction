Results from that exam are not expected to be officially announced until Wednesday, but MLB Network's Dan Plesac tweeted on Tuesday that the MRI showed a partial tear in Reyes' right ulnar collateral ligament, perhaps setting the stage for Tommy John surgery. The club has not confirmed the report. Not good news on the rt elbow of #STLCards Alex Reyes. MRI reveals partial tear in rt UCL. Not certain ..BUT ...TJ surgery looms. — Dan Plesac (@Plesac19) February 14, 2017 \n\"I'm concerned about Reyes,\" Mozeliak said. \"Any time you send someone out for an MRI, it's concerning.\" \n\"I don't like MRIs,\" added manager Mike Matheny. \"There must be a significant reason to do it.\" \n• 5 questions Cardinals face as camp opens \nIndications that something was amiss with Reyes began in the morning when he dressed out of his workout clothes and left the complex. He returned shortly after but did not throw his scheduled bullpen session. As the Cardinals were wrapping up their first official workout, Reyes departed to undergo the additional testing. \nReyes, 22, last experienced discomfort in that area in 2013, when he was diagnosed with an elbow strain. He made his season debut on June 20 that year. \n\"Clearly, I'm hoping for the best,\" Mozeliak said. \"Good or bad, we have to push. That's what we do.\" \nRegardless of whether the Cardinals envisioned Reyes breaking camp in the big league rotation, he was expected to be a key contributor in 2017. Ranked by MLBPipeline.com as the No. 6 prospect in baseball, Reyes debuted last August and added to the hype by showcasing an advanced arsenal of pitches.

He was moved permanently to the rotation in mid-September and led the team to wins in each of his subsequent starts. \nOriginally slated to pitch in the World Baseball Classic, Reyes had been named to the Dominican Republic's designated pitcher pool. \n\"You never want somebody to walk in the first day [and deal with this],\" Matheny said. \"I don't care who it is.\" has covered the Cardinals for MLB.com since 2012, and previously covered the Pirates from 2007-11.
