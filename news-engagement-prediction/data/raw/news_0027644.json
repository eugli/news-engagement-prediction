(JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, February 14, 2017, 10:14 AM \nWASHINGTON — In his first public comments since National Security Advisor Michael Flynn's resignation , President Trump reserved his fury not for Flynn but for the government officials who leaked the story of Flynn's talks with Russia. \n\"The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington? Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?\" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. \nIt's notable that Trump sounds a lot more frustrated with the national security officials who leaked that Flynn had private conversations about sanctions with Russia's ambassador before Trump's inauguration than with Flynn himself. \nThe White House reportedly knew about Flynn's conversation weeks ago — and that he'd misled Vice President Pence about it afterwards. Trump and his advisers didn't act to reprimand him until the story became public and Flynn was eventually forced to resign. On the other hand, they've been increasingly talking about ways to crack down on leaks following multiple stories where career diplomats and government workers exposed information that they refused to put out on private phone calls. \nFlynn's private conversations with Russia that seemed aimed at undercutting the Obama administration's sanctions against the country are a breach of government conduct and potentially broke the law. It's as yet unclear whether President Trump himself knew about the conversation's details at the time. Donald Trump in the White House \nCongressional Republicans, however, didn't sound eager to investigate Trump's Russia ties. House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) told reporters that the investigation is \"taking care of itself\" Tuesday morning, while House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) put out a statement saying that Washington \"can be a rough town for honorable people\" and thanking Flynn for his service. \nOf Republicans, only Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) seemed eager to criticize the White House, saying in a statement that Flynn's resignation \"raises further questions about the Trump administration's intentions toward Vladimir Putin's Russia\" while avoiding threats of an investigation. \n\"American policy toward Russia must be made clear and unequivocal: we will honor our commitments to our NATO allies, we will maintain and enhance our deterrent posture in Europe, we will hold Russian violators of human rights accountable for their actions, and we will maintain sanctions on Russia so long as it continues to violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,\" McCain said in a statement.
