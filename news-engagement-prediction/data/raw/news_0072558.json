Surfing legend Kelly Slater calls for shark cull Last updated 17:06, February 27 2017 \nKelly Slater watched from the shore as his fellow surfer Mick Fanning was attacked by a shark in 2015. \nSurfing great Kelly Slater has called for a \"serious\" shark cull in the waters off the French island of Reunion, after a surfer was killed in the area last week, bringing the number of attacks to 20 since 2011. \nThe 11-time world champion posted to his Instagram account, saying there was a \"clear imbalance happening in the ocean there\" and the French government \"needs to figure this out ASAP\". \nAccording to The Guardian , locals say bull and tiger shark populations have grown since Reunion banned hunting sharks for food in 1999. GETTY IMAGES \nKelly Slater says 20 shark attacks in six years is too much for one island. \nThe ban came amid concerns the sharks' flesh is contaminated with ciguatera, a toxin that causes vomiting, nausea and in some cases, death. \nREAD MORE: KRISTIN SCHOLTZ/WSL \nKelly Slater, right, comforts Mick Fanning after he was attacked by a shark at the J-Bay Open in 2015. \n\"Honestly, I won't be popular for saying this but there needs to be a serious cull on Reunion and it should happen everyday,\" Slater said. \n\"If the whole world had these rates of attack nobody would use the ocean and literally millions of people would be dying like this. The French [government] needs to figure this out ASAP. Twenty attacks since 2011!?\" \nSlater clarified his position after coming under fire for his comments, defending his record as an \"environmental activist\" and asking for constructive debate. GETTY \nSurfing giant Kelly Slater has asked for \"constructive debate\" about shark culls. \n\"I have been an environmental activist and voice for more campaigns than I can remember,\" he wrote. Ad Feedback \n\"My heart is in the right place but now I am being vehemently attacked by the people I have most identified with for the majority of my life. \n\"Humans are the biggest threat to life on earth as most creatures know it. But they are also the most capable and able to fix the issues we face. \n\"My comments were in reaction to another death of a kid following his passion. I know more about this issues than 99 plus per cent of people commenting yet I still don't know enough. \n\"I was in no way advocating for a worldwide destruction of any species. In fact, there's a chance many more species of sharks and other sea life could thrive without the over abundance of bull sharks in Reunion Island ravaging the local environment. \n\"This is not about me having fun and being selfish for my sport. This is a human and environmental issue. \n\"I have never personally killed even a single shark in my lifetime and am not fronting an effort to do so. So say what you need to say and let's get on with where this needs to go. \n\"Maybe something good will come of it.\" A post shared by Kelly Slater (@kellyslater) on Feb 25, 2017 at 8:06am PST \nAustralian surfer Mick Fanning was attacked by a shark at the J-Bay Open in 2015.
