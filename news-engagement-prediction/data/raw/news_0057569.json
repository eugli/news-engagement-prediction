But there's no doubt that Miami does them best. They're simple, but though they be but little, they be fierce. \nTraditionally, croquetas are made with mashed potatoes or ground meat and mixed with béchamel sauce, then formed into a bite-sized cylinder and fried until golden brown. But nowadays they take on many different shapes, sizes and flavors. From the traditional variety of Miami favorites like Palomilla Grill and Enriqueta's Sandwich Shop, to the more un-traditional leaning croquetas found at restaurants like Sugarcane Raw Bar and Grill and Bulla, the options and flavors are just about limitless in this town. \nHere are 11 places you can find the best versions of the tiny but mighty, fried perfection of a snack we all know too well —   order. Go ahead and try them all. Nobody has ever overdosed. 1 Bulla Restaurant \n\"Bulla\" is Spanish slang for \"Hype,\" as in, These croquetas are so hype .
