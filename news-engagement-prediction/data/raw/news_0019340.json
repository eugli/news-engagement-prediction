(Jeff Morehead/The Chronicle-Tribune via AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated: Thursday, February 9, 2017, 4:44 AM \nA fast-moving storm is expected to clog up morning commutes and blanket New York City in up towards 12 inches of snow on Thursday, forecasters said. \nPublic schools and courts are shuttered for what could become the worst storm of an otherwise mild and snow-free winter. The storm raced in over New Jersey and rapidly approached downtown Manhattan by the predawn hours, with meteorologists expecting at least 8 inches across the Big Apple. \nA winter storm alert is in effect throughout the five boroughs until 6 p.m. and parts of the Bronx are likely to see the largest accumulation of snow. \nCity buses will see a 20% reduction in service and the MTA suspended express subway service in order to leave tracks open for train storage. \nStrong winds, rain predicted in powerful storm heading toward NYC \nTransit officials will monitor public transportation conditions throughout the day and more than 3,000 staffers are ready to shovel and plow. \nMotorists are encouraged to stay off the roads, as officials are expecting high-speed winds, coastal flooding and potential power outages. \nAir travel was also harshly affected by the impending storm, with JFK cancelling nearly 500 flights, LaGuardia cancelling roughly 550 flights and Newark halting over 600 trips. \nThe National Weather Service predicts that the most intense snowfall will be over by the early afternoon. Whiteout conditions are possible, as the storm could at times dump between 2 and 4 inches of snow per hour. \nThe storm is expected to have passed over the city completely by the early evening.
