Local police said approximately 160,000 people had heeded her call. \nMany of those flooding the major Via Laietana thoroughfare carried signs reading “Enough excuses, welcome them now”. \nThe protest comes after Spain pledged to take in about 16,000 asylum seekers from other EU countries under a quota system agreed in 2015 as the continent struggled with its biggest migration crisis since the second world war. \nLike other EU members, Spain has fallen far short of this target, with only 1,100 resettled in the country so far. \nJacint Comelles, a 62-year-old potter who joined the protest with friends and family, said not enough was being done to help people who have fled conflict hoping to start a new life in Europe. “We demand this minimum amount of dignity – that at least this number of refugees (16,000) can come,” he said. “In Catalonia , everything is ready to welcome them.” \nThe protest, organised by a group calling itself Casa Nostra Casa Vostra (Our home is your home), finished at the Mediterranean coast – a symbolic location given the more than 5,000 migrants who lost their lives trying to cross the sea last year. \nSenior Barcelona lawmaker Mercè Conesa on Wednesday said it was “shameful” that Spain had not taken in more refugees, and urged the European commission to begin “severely sanctioning” countries that did not meet their pledges on the issue. \nBarcelona, capital of the wealthy northeastern region of Catalonia, put forward a plan in August 2015 for resettling refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Eritrea.
