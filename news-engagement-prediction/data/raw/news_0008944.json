The airline has about 300 pilots for these planes. \n\nThe 24 pilots who have sought NOC had joined erstwhile Indian Airlines in 2007-08 and used to fly the Airbus A-320s. In 2012 when AI was getting ready to receive the Dreamliners, they were put on training to fly this plane. \n\nTheir grouse emerges from the fact that people who joined the airline after them as co-pilots are becoming commanders on the A-320 while they remain co-pilots on the Boeing-787. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-07T17:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-07T08:05:36.551+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
