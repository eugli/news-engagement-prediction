(Reuters) India’s big IT services companies have ganged up to keep salary of freshers low taking advantage of oversupply of software engineers at the entry level, says industry veteran T V Mohandas Pai. “That’s the problem with Indian IT (industry). Indian IT is not paying its freshers well. And in fact, big companies are coming together talking to each other not to increase their salary,” he told PTI. Reports indicate that as against offers of Rs 2.25 lakh per annum that used to go out for freshers two decades ago, they have risen only to Rs 3.5 lakh now, which suggests a massive decrease in real wages from an inflation-adjusted perspective.\nPai, who served as Chief Financial Officer at Bengaluru-headquartered IT major Infosys Ltd from 1994 to 2006, said it’s a very sad fact that big companies are talking to each other not to increase freshers’ salaries. “It’s not a good sign for the Indian IT industry. They must break away. That too big services companies. Services companies talk to each other, not a good sign, they must break away from this,” he said.\nYou may also like to watch:", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-21T22:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-21T17:54:19.169+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
