There was burning of houses by a mob of people who are suspected to be from Atteridgeville accusing foreigners of drug dealing and keeping brothels‚” Selepe said. \nShe said that by the time police responded to the scene‚ two houses had already been burnt down. \n“Police are keeping a strong presence and are on the ground monitoring the situation‚” she said. \nThis comes after similar violent scenes played out in the crime-riddled Rosettenville area. Residents also torched houses and alleged brothels believed to be operated by foreign nationals. Police arrested a number of community members that were part of the violence. This prompted Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba to visit the area last week on Monday. \nTMG Digital/TimesLIVE Tweet SHARE YOUR OPINION If you have an opinion you would like to share on this article, please to the Times LIVE iLIVE team.
