Where’s the fuse box? How do you put the heating on timer? \nLight switches, however, rarely prove to be an issue. \nThat is unless you’re Donald Trump’s team and you’re still trying to get to grips with the White House. Alex Wong via Getty Images Trump's team have reportedly struggled to work the lights at the White House \nAccording to the New York Times , the light switches in the cabinet offices are proving rather tricky. \nAides have reportedly had to hold meetings in the dark because of the problem and visitors have struggled to find exits in the gloom. \nThe reports prompted many social media users to mock Trump and his administration...
