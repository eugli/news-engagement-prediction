Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump has tried to portray himself as a defender of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community - but has faced pressure from conservatives. \nSchools, for example, would therefore have to allow transgender individuals to use the bathroom that corresponds to their gender identity, rather than the sex assigned to them at birth. \nA Washington Post report that broke the story said the new policy “ does not diminish the protections from bullying and harassment that are available to all students”. \nThe Obama administration directive prompted legal challenges from 13 states and a Texas federal judge’s intervention based on interpretation of Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education.

But he reversed his stance after facing Republican criticism. \nThe Trump administration’s latest decision could affect the case of Gavin Grimm , a transgender teenager in Virginia who sued his school for the right to use the boys bathroom. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on March 28, and the rescinding of the federal guidance could give the court an excuse to throw it back to the lower court.
