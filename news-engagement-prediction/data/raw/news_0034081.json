However, there are some awesome Google Chrome extensions to fix these common annoyances once and for all. Read More to make it just right for you. Let’s look at some URL tricks to get more out of the service. 1. Link to Any Part of a Video \nTypically, when you copy a link to a YouTube video, it starts from the beginning. If you want to show someone just a bit of a video or skip a lengthy intro, you can append a time stamp to the URL to start it at that time. \nYou can do this in a couple of ways. By manually adding &t=YmXXs to the end of a video URL, you’ll set it to start that many minutes/seconds into the video. You can omit minutes, or use only seconds, such as 90s for a minute and a half. So, this video: youtube.com/watch?v=7RWI3-8N_-Y \nCan be shared 90 seconds in using this URL: youtube.com/watch?v=7RWI3-8N_-Y&t=1m30s \nIf you don’t want to use the manual method, pause the video at the time you’d like to share it at, then right-click and choose Copy video URL at current time . 2.

Skip a Certain Amount of the Intro \nSimilar to the trick that lets you pick the start time, you can also choose to skip a certain amount of seconds at the start of the video. You can’t specify minutes with this one, so use 90 (seconds) for a minute and a half. So, to skip the first 30 seconds of this video: youtube.com/watch?v=1F_bG-uJMns \nAdd start=30 to the URL and get this: youtube.com/watch?v=1F_bG-uJMns&start=90 \nThis is similar to the timing one, but a bit faster to type and doesn’t require you to remember a certain time stamp. 5. Download YouTube Videos \nIf you’d like to download a copy of a YouTube video for your own records, there are a couple of URL shortcuts that easily let you do that. \nBefore the youtube.com in the URL, type either pwn or kick to jump to services that will let you download those videos in a variety of formats. So, this URL: youtube.com/watch?v=kFIsoq63lwo \nCan be downloaded by changing the URL to either of these: pwnyoutube.com/watch?v=kFIsoq63lwo kickyoutube.com/watch?v=kFIsoq63lwo \nRemember to play fair; don’t download copyrighted YouTube videos Why Your Favorite Video Just Disappeared From YouTube Why Your Favorite Video Just Disappeared From YouTube We suspect that you, like us, have found one of your favorite videos suddenly, and inexplicably, removed from YouTube.
