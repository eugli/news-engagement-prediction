PUBLISHED: 23:05, Sat, Feb 4, 2017 | UPDATED: 23:23, Sat, Feb 4, 2017 GETTY•TWITTER Tory MSP Gordon Lindhurst warned Sturgeon to do more to encourage business exports. \nScottish ministers are scrambling to develop a strategy to mitigate the effects of the falling pound, which is causing the price of imports to rise.Other concerns including fears the impact a loss of EU workers could have on Scottish firms, as well as the prospect of pricy trade tariffs in future business deals with Europe, were laid out in the report by Holyrood’s economy committee today.The revelations come as Sturgeon’s government faces pressures over mediocre economic growth at just a third of Britain’s GDP, and rising unemployment.Committee convenor Gordon Lindhurst said: \"The Committee is calling on the Scottish Government to re-double its efforts in encouraging and supporting businesses to export.“The need to support SMEs is more crucial than ever. The Committee cannot over-state the importance of continuing to promote the growth of indigenous businesses, and it is vital that the right balance is struck between supporting foreign direct investment and home grown businesses.”Mr Lindhurst added: “Crucially, the valuable knowledge, experience and expertise of Scotland’s businesses should be central to any renewed policy.“Scotland has always been an outward looking country that has much to give to the rest of the world.“The Committee is urging the Scottish Government and Enterprise Agencies to engage with businesses based in Scotland to understand what specific support is needed from sector to sector region to region.”The report advises Scotland moves to “maximise” opportunities with fast-growing economies such as China or India.But the report also warns the Scottish Government that it must continue to support firms trading with the rest of the UK – which accounts for the vast majority of the country’s exports.Nicola Sturgeon was told to grow up and end threats of further independence referendums Friday, and accused of using “bully” language to force another vote.Leading Brexiteer Michael Gove blasted the First Minister and accused the SNP of immaturity over its repeated whines over leaving the European Union.Mr Gove said: “Trying to suggest that a vote in the Scottish parliament is a way of exercising some sort of veto or sending a signal to the UK Government is not really grown up politics.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-05T06:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-05T01:34:15.145+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
