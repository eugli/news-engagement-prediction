We want our top investigators on this case,\" Houston Police Department Executive Assistant Chief G.T. Buenik said in a Tuesday press conference. \"Hopefully we'll make an arrest but more importantly, recover that jersey for Tom Brady . There's really no leads at this point. We are piecing together different sets of information.\"\nBuenik said that he did not know if Houston PD investigators had spoken to Brady yet, but \"they probably will at some point.\"\nKen Goldin, the founder of Goldin Auctions, told the Daily News that the jersey could be worth upwards of $500,000, even though no one would be able to sell the item since it is alleged stolen property.\nIt is apparently a big enough crime in Texas to warrant several law enforcement agencies carrying out the investigation of the whodunit caper.\n\"The Houston Police Department is the lead agency in the search for the missing Tom Brady jersey. We're working in connection with the Texas Rangers (of the Texas Department of Public Safety), the NFL security department and NRG park security,\" said Buenik. \"We're attempting to see if we can identify who was in that (Patriots) locker room at that time. They would be possible suspects.\n\"We're in the process of obtaining some video that may or may not have captured it. We know that there (were) a lot of news people in there,\" Buenik continued. \"We're asking all the cameramen — if they can hear me now — check your video, to see if maybe they have captured something. The police investigators may be contacting you so we can look to see in an attempt to identify everybody that was in that locker room at that time.\"\nVideo of Brady at his locker stall after the Super Bowl LI win shows him talking to who appears to be a Patriots clubhouse attendant. \"Someone stole it. I put it in here, man,\" says Brady, pointing to his stall.\nBuenik said Tuesday that he was not certain of how many credentialed individuals were allowed to enter the Patriots' clubhouse after the Super Bowl.\n\"Access to the locker room is controlled by New England Patriots team security. There is a Houston police officer that is stationed outside that locker room,\" said Buenik. \"There are two security officers that actually determine who can enter. You do need some type of special credential. Even Houston police officers are not allowed in there. Team security really determines who's able to enter that locker room, along with some of the media people. We're attempting to gather a list of people that were in that locker room at that point.\"\nBuenik also asked for the public's help, and to call 713-222-TIPS with any information that might be useful.\n\"We know that somebody knows something. There will be a reward out for the stolen jersey and the information leading to the arrest of whoever took Tom Brady's jersey,\" said Buenik. \"We'll look at everybody that had access to that locker room.\"\nPHOTOS: Top images from Super Bowl LI\nSuper Bowl LI Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxnews.com/", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmHTru?blobrefkey=1001&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;104&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmHTru?blobrefkey=104&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1280&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;720&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;101&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp", "http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/5e01ee04-6f93-4331-b063-ee19911546fb/12767a3d-7f7e-4548-b563-db2a6d7f97b7.ism/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl)&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/tom-brady-stolen-super-bowl-jersey-sparks-police-investigation-article-1.2965777", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;DomainId&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfSI2c.img", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6BD5t.img", "https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f02%2fen-us%2fAAmHTru%3focid%3dsl&title=Who+stole+Tom+Brady%27s+jersey%3f&source=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f02%2fen-us%2fAAmHTru%3focid%3dsl", "http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmHTru?blobrefkey=102&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;640&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;360&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;103&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://prod-video-cms-amp-microsoft-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmHTru?blobrefkey=103&$blob=1&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:&quot;1024&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:&quot;576&quot;},{&quot;formatCode&quot;:&quot;1004&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://eus-streaming-video-msn-com.akamaized.net/5e01ee04-", "https://web.skype.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f02%2fen-us%2fAAmHTru&lang=en-us&flow_id=1a36d2ed-1c3d-4cc9-b75a-b25b47029c9a", "https://twitter.com/share?url=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f02%2fen-us%2fAAmHTru%3focid%3dst&text=Who+stole+Tom+Brady%27s+jersey%3f&original_referer=http%3a%2f%2fa.msn.com%2f02%2fen-us%2fAAmHTru%3focid%3dst", "http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAmHW6k.img&quot;}}", "http://video.foxnews.com/v/feed/playlist/2090120837001.xml?template=fox&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;externalPlayerName&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBwX8Qj.img", "http://video.foxnews.com/v/5314580289001/?playlist_id=2090120837001&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;FOX"], "published": "2017-02-08T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-08T07:35:50.296+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
