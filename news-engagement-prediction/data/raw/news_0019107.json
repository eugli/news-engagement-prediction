Ek, 33, tops Billboard’s annual “ Power 100 ”, rising from No 10 last year. He displaces Lucian Grainge, the chairman and CEO of Universal Music Group. \nOpening its citation for Ek, Billboard says: “For the first time since Napster decimated music sales, the recorded-music industry is showing signs of growth, and that reversal of fortune is largely due to one man … Daniel Ek.” \nIt notes that Spotify’s impact in the US “has been nothing short of transformative: in 2016, streaming accounted for 51% of music consumption in the United States, and Spotify dominated the category”. \nEk co-founded Spotify in 2011, rapidly gaining major-label support for the vision of an industry-backed site making a vast catalogue of music available. It has also become a significant driver of music discovery, with the playlists it suggests to users. \nAlthough Spotify is estimated to be worth £8bn, it has still not turned a profit. In 2015, the most recent year for which figures are available, it made a loss of $200m. Billboard’s Power 100 top 10 \n1. Daniel Ek – chairman/CEO of Spotify 2.
