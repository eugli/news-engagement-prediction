The last time Finance produced a long-term projection — which was also the first time, in response to a recommendation by the Auditor-General — it was released as an annex to the fall update in 2014. (It’s understandable that a newly-elected government would not have been able to produce a long-term projection in 2015.) \nAnd indeed, there was something odd about the timing; it turns out that the reason for the delay was not that Finance needed more time to update the work it had done in 2014. As reported in The Globe and Mail, the long-term update had in fact been prepared a couple of weeks before the Fall Economic Statement. But instead of publishing it along with the publicized release of the economic statement, the long-term outlook was given the Friday-before-a-holiday news dump treatment. The long-term update wasn’t even given a press release, and if you’re wondering how newsworthy an item has to be before Finance will dignify it with a press release, the next one was on the “2017 automobile deduction limits and expense benefit rates for business.” \nThis sort of gamesmanship with budget numbers is fast becoming a hallmark of the still-new Liberal government, and it goes back to its very first days in power. Part of the Liberal campaign messaging in support of its plan to run a two-year deficit (remember that?) was that the Canadian economy was performing poorly, and that the federal government would end up running a deficit regardless of who won the election. Related John Ivison: Airport sell-off would offer Liberals financial gain without political pain \nIt turned out that this was not the case. By the time the Liberals took power, federal revenues and the budget balance were running ahead of the projections in the Conservatives’ 2015 budget. The new government could have simply accepted this state of affairs as it prepared for the 2016 budget, but instead the Liberals embarked on a graceless effort to make the data fit their narrative. They eventually succeeded, of course: governments have enough discretionary power to swing the budget balance a few billion dollars in whichever way they want. But it says something about the Liberal government that its first budgetary priority was to fiddle the numbers to fit a minor campaign talking point. \nSince then, the Liberals have been playing a game of misdirection to divert attention away from its plans for the second half of its mandate and beyond. Indeed, the 2016 budget hardly mentioned years three and four of the Liberal mandate. Detailed numbers were only provided for the first two years, with vague assurances that the budget would move towards balance by the end of the mandate. \nMore detailed numbers would have to wait until the Fall Economic Statement, but again, the government did the best it could to avoid talking about them. Pride of place was given to announcements of new infrastructure programs, and the budget projections — now a $98.1 billion deficit over four years, instead of $25 billion over two years — were given second billing. But if the economic statement had included the long-term update and its projections of deficits until the year 2050, then the Liberals might have been obliged to spend more time explaining why they had chosen to send Canada down this path, and not the one it had promised to follow in the election campaign. \nThe obvious inference to draw is that the Liberals didn’t want to talk about the long-term outlook, and so it was dropped from the fall statement. The government couldn’t suppress it completely — there’s the whole business of the Auditor-General’s recommendation — so they did the next best thing, by both publishing the report and doing their best to pretend it didn’t exist. \nThe Liberals campaigned on a promise to run a more transparent government than the Conservatives, but we still don’t know what the Liberals’ long-term plan is. (The Conservative plan, on the other hand, was crystal clear: steadily lower taxes and spending. You may not have liked the plan, but at least you know what it was.) We don’t even know if the Liberals have even given the question much thought. All we really know is that the Liberals have long since abandoned the plan they campaigned on: to run a modest, short-lived deficit and then return to balance. But we still don’t know how or why they arrived at that decision, and they’ve been doing their best to avoid discussing the matter. \nThere’s a point where games stop being fun. The Liberals should get serious about the future — and the upcoming budget would be as a good place as any to start. \nNational Post ", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-13T23:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-14T00:31:04.885+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
