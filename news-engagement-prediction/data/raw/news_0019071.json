As the experimenter changes the independent variable , the effect on the dependent variable is observed and recorded.For example, a scientist wants to see if the brightness of light has any effect on a moth being attracted to the light. The brightness of the light is controlled by the scientist. This would be the independent variable. How the moth reacts to the different light levels (distance to light source) would be the dependent variable.When results are plotted in graphs, the convention is to use the independent variable as the x-axis and the dependent variable as the y-axis. \ncontinue reading below our video What are the Seven Wonders of the World", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-08T18:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-09T01:46:46.818+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
