Interstate demand for low-emission buses \nState Manufacturing and Innovation Minister Kyam Maher said dozens of buses would be manufactured for supply to other states.

(Supplied: SA Government) \n\"The agreement to manufacture an additional 50 low carbon emission diesel buses in northern Adelaide is great news for local automotive suppliers as it creates opportunities across other areas of advanced manufacturing,\" he said. \n\"The fact that the first-ever wholly-Australian designed, engineered and manufactured electric buses will roll off the production line later this month right here in northern Adelaide is further evidence of the state's advanced manufacturing expertise.\" \nMr Fitch said helping northern Adelaide job prospects was a priority. \n\"The alliance is committed to maximising the use of local materials and suppliers across the manufacturing process to provide the most benefit to the northern Adelaide community,\" he said. \nThe Government expressed hopes a further 50 jobs could be created as the new business grows, and says the venture already is working with about 20 local suppliers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-11T10:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-11T05:34:36.929+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
