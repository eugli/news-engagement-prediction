The tariff was supposed to eventually drop to 9% once the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement went into effect, but Trump withdrew the U.S. from that accord. Many in Japan are wary of starting bilateral trade negotiations with the U.S. because of the risk that Washington might demand a deeper cut to the tariff.
