Tom Thibodeau, Derrick Rose (Getty Images) \nUpdated at 1:49  49 a.m. ET \nIf Derrick Rose is eager to reunite with his former coach Tom Thibodeau in Minnesota, he did his best on Tuesday to keep that desire to himself. \nMORE: Carmelo says he won't leave Knicks unless he has a 'plan' \n“I haven’t heard anything about it until I came back (from the All-Star break),” Rose said, per the New York Post . “Like I said before I left, you never know what’s going to happen. You’ve got to be a professional about it. And whatever it is, I’ll be prepared.” \nRose is no longer an MVP-caliber player thanks to a string of injuries, the Wolves are a long shot to make the playoffs this year and Rose likely would have to split time with Kris Dunn in Minnesota. His main value to the Timberwolves, then, would seem to be financial. Rose can become a free agent in July and Rubio has two years and about $29 million remaining on his contract after this season. Being able to move Rubio's money is a nice incentive for Thibodeau to make a deal. \nMORE: Lakers agree to send Lou Williams to Rockets \nThe Knicks were hoping Rose and another former Bull, Joakim Noah, would help make the team a contender in the East this season, but that experiment is failing, so now there's talk of a rebuild. Rose and Carmelo Anthony are among the Knicks available ahead of Thursday's deadline. \nRose, for his part, is just waiting to see whatever happens next. \n“Does it matter if you’re on the trading block? It doesn’t matter. I love it (in New York) but it’s not up to me, it’s up to the front office,” Rose said, per the Post. “I don’t have a problem with the coaching staff, I don’t have a problem with my teammates. I love it here but like I said, this is a business. \n“I’m just going with the flow. You’ve just got to go with it, not even think about it.\" Rose said. \"The only thing I can control is the way that I’m playing, my performance and just trying to keep guys together. Other than that, everything else is out of my control.” Watch This", "external_links": [], "published": "2017-02-22T13:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2017-02-22T09:00:54.992+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
